REPORT OF THE TEMPORARY  MIXED COMMISSION        FOR THE  REDUCTION OF  ARMAMENTS.PREAMBLE.    In accordance with the resolution of the last Assembly, the Temporary Mixed commission has continued during the year 1922 the work with which it was entrusted by the First Assembly.The work carried out during this year has confirmed it in the impression which  it tried to conveyin the preliminary paragraphs of its Report for 1921.    The problem of disarmament still appears to it as one of the most difficult which confront theLeague of Nations, and, despite its difficulties, as one which  must be the  object of its constantattention and its most persistent efforts.  As was the case last year, the main obstacle with whichthe Temporary Mixed Commission has had to contend in its efforts to bring about some measureof disarmament  is the general situation of the world, its instability and the prudence with whichall countries must consider proposals for disarmament.    The year 1922 witnessed a clearly defined effort to reach a solution of this difficult problem in a somewhat restricted area, both geographical and technical.  The Conference of Washingtonapproached  the question of the limitation of naval armaments and that of the solution of certainpolitical problems in the Pacific.    The conventions resulting therefrom are well known.    A similar effort is to be observed in the Pan-American Congress which will meet in Santiagode Chile.    Despite these manifestations of the spirit of international co-operation  which is seen at workin the world, the general situation is still too unfavourably affected by the after-effects  of thelast war. The three  Great  Powers, the immense military  importance  (actual or  potential) ofwhich was  mentioned in the Report of the Commission for last year, are still outside the League.This fact in itself might suffice to hinder, if not altogether to block,  several of the activities towhich, on the instructions of the  Assembly, the Temporary Mixed Commission  has  given itsattention. Moreover, the memory of the war still maintains in many States a feeling of insecurity,which is represented in the candid statements in which, at the request of  the Assembly, several of them  have put  forward the  requirements of their national security,  and  the  political and geographical considerations which contribute to shape their policy in the matter of armaments.    Despite the  scarcely favourable conditions under which, on the whole,  the Temporary  mixed commission has  worked,  it has been  nevertheless able to make fairly satisfactory progress on a.certain number of points. Moreover, while its attention had so far been limited to problems of aspecial nature, the Temporary Mixed Commission  has at last been able  to tackle the centralproblem itself: that of the reduction of armaments.   During the three sessions of the year  it hasexamined no less than two series of schemes  having this aim in view: one series aiming  at theextension of the principles of the Treaty of Washington on the limitation of naval armaments tothe Members of the League  that were not parties to that Treaty, and another series aiming atestablishing the  principles on which land armaments might be limited by  means of a system of mutual guarantee.    Finally, the statistical enquiry which, at the suggestion of the Temporary Mixed Commission,was the object  of a resolution of the Second Assembly, has already resulted  in the collectionof important military, political  and  geographical documents,  which  define  the  situation ineach country in  the matter of armaments, and which it was necessary should be at  the disposalof the League of  Nations before attempting any practical reduction.    On other points, however, such as the traffic in arms, connected with  the  ratification of theConvention of St.-Germain, the state of affairs, as will be explained further on, has not improved.    On the whole, the Temporary Mixed Commission considers that the documents and proposals submitted to the Council and the Assembly, though not a decisive step towards the solution of the delicate problem the consideration of which has been assigned to it, still mark real progress, whichwill, no doubt, be followed by fruitful work.S.d.N. 800 9/22, Imp.

- A--GENERAL  QUESTIONS.I.   LIMITATION OF NATIONAL EXPENDITURE ON ARMAMENTS.     At its second session, the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted the following resolution:             &quot;Subject to the conditions set out in the recommendations of the First Assembly,         the recommendation that Members of the League should undertake not to  exceed, for         the next two financial years following the present year, the sum total of expenditure         on military, naval and air forces provided for in the budget of that year, be again forward-         ed to all Members of the League, together with a statement showing the replies already         received to this recommendation.&quot;     The Council endorsed this resolution, and the Secretary-General wrote to the Members of theLeague on January 17th, 1922, enclosing a copy of the recommendation contained in the resolution,and a statement of the replies received by the Secretariat.     An annex is appended, showing in column form the replies received to both the recommenda-tion of the First Assembly and the decision of the Second Assembly. It will be seen that, leaving aside the States whose military status is settled by the Peace Treaties, most of the Governmentsshow their willingness to reduce their military expenditure as much as possible, either in deference to the Assembly&apos;s recommendation or owing to the  general economic crisis now being experiencedall  over the world.   Many of them, however, hesitate to pledge themselves as suggested in therecommendation of the Assembly.     In the course of the discussion of this situation before the Commission, one of its members,M.Lebrun, pointed out that it was of less importance to ascertain whether the States were prepared in advance to submit to certain general regulations, thus relinquishing a portion of their freedomof action, than to acquire information on their present expenditure and ascertain whether  theyconformed to the recommendations of the Assembly.  He therefore proposed that, without awaiting the completion of the very comprehensive and detailed work of the Sub-Committee on Statistics,the characteristic features of the military expenditure of the States should be grouped in tables.     This was the origin of the  resolution which was adopted by the Temporary Mixed Commis-sion and approved by the Council in the following terms, at the meeting in July:             &quot;The Commission proposes to  submit to the next Assembly, in the form  of tables         which can be readily understood and which will be annexed to its report, the following         information:              &quot;(1)  The  reduction  in military  expenditure  effected in accordance with the         Recommendation of the First Assembly by  the various States in 1921 and  1922 com--         pared  with the amount of previous budgets;             &quot;(2) The  difference between such  expenditure  in  the years  1913 (pre-war)  and         1922 expressed in terms  both of paper currency and gold;             &quot;(3)  The  relative importance of military  budgets  as  compared with  ordinary        budgets  during the three typical  years  1913-1918-1922,  a  distinction  being  drawn        between the actual military budgets (Army, Navy, Military Aviation, Colonies)  and        the  same budgets minus the exceptional expenditure  due  to  the war or to interna-        tional  obligations.&quot;    The tables  thus prepared and approved by the Commission,  as well as  an explanatory note on the conclusions that might be  drawn from them, are the object of a special volume annexed(A.  31a).    The  explanatory note which accompanies these tables rightly points out  that,  owing tothe differences in the systems of  public book-keeping adopted by various States, it is advisable to be cautious in drawing comparisons between the figures corresponding to the different countries.    The  Commission therefore are  of opinion that  the work  begun must be continued  and developed in order to present, if  possible, comparable figures at a later date.               ^    The  intention of the Commission  in presenting this preliminary study was  to furnisher&apos;documentation which should show the change  in military expenditure, as well as the particulartendency of each  country in this respect.  Given the importance attached to this question by1 See Annex I.
II.   STATISTICAL ENQUIRY.               1.  FIRST RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE COURSE OF THE ENQUIRY.    The Second Assembly, recognising that the final and general limitation of armaments providedfor in Article 8 of the Covenant is dependent on certain preliminary conditions, decided that a statistical investigation should be carried out with regard to the armaments of the various countries for the years 1913 and  1921, on the basis of the programme which was published in the Reportfori92i1.    The Secretariat, under the control of the Temporary Commission and of the Council,  wasentrusted with the carrying out of this programme.  In case of need it might invite the co-operationof competent correspondents in the different countries, the choice of these  correspondents being left to the Armaments  Section under the direction of the  Temporary Commission.    The Secretariat was authorised to publish from time to time, with the consent of the TemporaryMixed Commission and  of the Council, reports on the partial results of its investigation, without waiting till the results of the statistical enquiry should have been  fully co-ordinated.    The Third Sub-Committee (on statistics) was formed  to  control the carrying out of the  pro-gramme formulated above and was authorised to meet separately.  Two of its  members, M. Janssenand M. Benini, were specially appointed by the Committee to follow the progress of the statisticalenquiry.    On February 22nd, 1922, the Secretariat  was authorised to appoint the correspondents providedfor by the decisions of the  Assembly. The  difficulties which have been encountered in findingthoroughly qualified experts have  been so considerable that up to the present the Secretariat has only been able to obtain collaborators from Italy, Belgium, France,  Greece, Switzerland, GreatBritain  (both for  Great Britain itself and for the Dominions), Chile and  Japan.    As the result of the request which was addressed to the Governments,  in accordance  withthe Assembly&apos;s resolution, a very  considerable number of official documents relating to the  lawsgoverning military organisation, etc., has been received from most States; these documents, however,generally&apos; refer to the pre-war period.    In order to supplement this information, documents obtained directly by the Secretariat  were consulted, viz., reports  of parliamentary debates,  draft budgets, year-books,  etc.    Reliable unofficial documents were also consulted, care being taken, however, to distinguishclearly  the information thus obtained.    At its July session the Sub-Committee investigated the work done by the Secretariat, and found  that:             In a certain number of States new laws relating to army organisation were being         prepared in 1921,  some  of them  being  actually  under discussion.             In the majority of the countries which were constituted or considerably changed as a         result of the late war, the existing military  organisation had  not  yet  received  legal         sanction.     The Sub-Committee therefore passed  the following  Resolution:              &quot;The Sub-Committee finds that,  owing to the fact that the laws governing  army         organisation are undergoing far reaching modifications and  that delays have occurred in         publishing the analytical results of the returns  obtained, the year 1921 cannot be taken1 See preface of separate volume (A. 31a giving the first results of the statistical enquiry.the First and Second Assemblies from  the  point of view of disarmament, and by the financial conference of Brussels from that of the financial situation of the world, it seems that a study of the changes undergone  by the military  budgets  during the last three years, in comparisonwith pre-war figures, must present a special interest.    The Commission drew  from these tables the following conclusions:     (a) On  the whole the estimated defence expenditure for the financial year 1922 (or 1922-23)shows a reduction as compared with the actual expenditure incurred in the two previous financial years.    (b) In appreciating the  significance of this  reduction, due consideration must be given,however, to the fact that, since the year 1920, in many of the countries concerned, there has beena falling off in war charges, owing to the operations connected with demobilisation,  and also tothe fact that in many countries there has been a considerable decrease in the prices of raw materials&apos;
as a basis for comparison with the pre war period.   The Sub-Committee has&apos;therefore decided to propose that the year 1922 should&apos; be substituted for 1921.&quot;    As will be seen from the programme adopted, the Assembly had provided that two lines of investigation should be followed,  viz.:    1. The collection of data based on official publications and other sources of public information.    2. The sending of a questionnaire to the Governments which are Members of the League ofNations.    At its last session the Committee stated that it was impossible to  obtain from the officialpublications of the various countries certain data which were necessary for the programme of theenquiry. It therefore begged three of its  members to prepare a questionnaire which, if approvedby the Council, might be sent to all the Governments.    The questionnaire suggested by this Sub-Committee included the  following points of  the statistical programme in which the year  1922 has been substituted for 1921:             II.  Effectives in time of peace (officers and other ranks):  army and gendarmery or        police;  land and sea forces, both home and colonial.   Number  of large units  (divi-        sions)  and small units  (companies,  squadrons, batteries).             V.   Numbers of men capable of being mobilised in time  of  war and number of        units in the land and sea forces at  home and in the colonies  (large units and  small        units).             VI.  Material actually in use and in the depots of the land and sea forces.                              Guns  (heavy,   field,  howitzer,  anti-aircraft).                              Rifles.             Land Forces.    ^ Machine-guns.                             &apos; Tanks.                              Army aircraft.             Q               (Warships, with their armament.             bea  1 orces.      i Navd  aircrafL    At first a somewhat comprehensive list of questions had been drawn up, which included variousimportant items, such as industrial mobilisation and stocks of munitions. After discussion, it wasdecided that these should be omitted.  On the other hand, in the course of its investigations, theCommittee, though adhering to this decision,  came to the conclusion that the resources of a state in raw materials, and the potential development of its sea transport services  and its industries, are essential elements of its military efficiency; the Committee therefore decided to add these points to the questionnaire.    The Secretariat, requested to co-ordinate the data obtained  from the published documents,has already begun its investigations. It is  also collecting information regarding the wealth, revenuesand economic resources of the various States, in so far as these items are necessary in estimating the other economic factors.-^The  volume annexed to this Report, and  answering the purposesabove stated, is intended as the first series of data obtained from the enquiry and includes thefollowing  items:    I. Summary of the organisation of the work done by the Secretariat; collection and examinationof documents; classification of data; resume  of the principal sources from which the information regarding  each  State  is  derived.    II.   Geographical and demographical data which may  possess a certain value as naturalfactors affecting the military power of  each State.    III.  Technical military data referring,  for the  reasons given above, exclusively to the pre-war period (1913-1914), but treated in such a  way as to enable them to be compared with existingdata  concerning the armaments of the various States  and  with the boundaries which  they have acquired since the war.                                                                                          i    IV.   Budgetary data concerning expenditure connected with national defence before and&apos;since  the  war.11 For convenience in consulting them, it is proposed to distribute budgetary data in a separate brochure.
    The Commission expresses its  admiration of the  Secretariats work  and the conscientiousway in which it has gathered together all these statistical&apos; data, which are as bulky as they arecomplex.  This  work has succeeded in revealing in a  most striking way  the complications and difficulties encountered in the consideration of the problem of the reduction of armaments by deal-ing with the matter from a purely  statistical  point of. view.    The Committee, in transmitting the statistics to the  Council,  considers it necessary to pointout, and even to lay stress upon, the fact  that this work should be received with the following observations.    It should be noted first of all that, on  account of the  various changes in size and population which the old countries have undergone, and the creation of new countries under the terms of the treaties of Peace, any direct comparison between the figures for 1913 and those for 1922 is renderedimpossible.    About 80,000,000 Europeans have changed nationality during this period.  Consequently,an attempt has been made to estimate what would have been the military strength of each countryin igi3if, at that date, it had already been in possession of the frontiers which have been assigned to it since the great war.  Indeed, no comparison can be carried out unless the year 1913 and theyears following  upon the war  have first been made comparable, however artificially; otherwise,all attempts at  reaching a comparison with the last pre-war year must be abandoned.    For this reason, failing any better  method, it was thought possible to base this estimate upona purely arithmetical foundation, though  it  was not possible to take into account  the entirely different political conditions  and  the unknown international reactions  which this hypothesisitself implies, nor the modifications of  an essentially  military and  technical character, which arean inevitable result  of the many changes in frontiers.    It is evident, for example, that no comparison can be drawn between the forces of one countryand the length  of its land frontiers, without taking into consideration the  considerable differenceinherent in  the  natural characteristics  of those frontiers  from  a defensive point  of  view.  It isno less certain that the length  of a land frontier cannot be added to that of a sea frontier withoutintroducing the question of a  combination of naval and  land forces,  and  that every attempt atdetermining the necessary forces for the defence of these frontiers would lead to arbitrary hypotheses.    The same remark applies  to all attempts to express by a number the value of an increase ordiminution of territory by combining the number for the  population and that for the area, bothmultiplied by certain coefficients.    To sum up: there is no accepted common measure which will permit an estimate of the resourcesof soldiers,  war material, population and  area, economic strength and geographical conditions.    Generally  speaking,  it seems necessaiy to draw  a  very clear distinction, between originalstatistics which represent actual facts and the application or combination  of  these  statistics.    It is essential that the League of Nations should have at its disposal in  its archives, for usein individual cases, a complete collection of these original statistics, beginning at the end of thepre-war period  (even if the pre-war figures can only be used separately) and  starting again afterthe war.    Statistical  enquiries may usefully contribute to the collection of  this documentation, butit should not be imagined that such documentation, however complete, can be made the founda-tion on which a scheme for the reduction of armaments could be built.    The Temporary Mixed Commission has therefore the honour  of presenting to the Council a provisional draft comprising the first series of statistics in regard to armaments.  With the per-mission of the Council, the Commission proposes to invite the Secretariat to circulate these docu-ments, together with the present report, to the Members  of the Permanent Advisory Commissionon  Military,  Naval and Air Questions, and also to the different Governments and  to a certainnumber of military and statistical experts in  the different countries, in order  to collect any usefulobservations which  might be  suggested.   This document would also remain at  the disposal ofthose Members of the Assembly who would wish to consult it.2.   - STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR    NATIONAL SECURITY, GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION, INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND SPECIAL    CONDITIONS.    The role of statistics as a descriptive element of the state of the armaments of a country is,however, limited.             &quot;It is not enough&quot;, said  the President,  M. Viviani,  &quot;to  report in writing  proofs        that one country  has as many soldiers as another, although its population  is smaller;        it is not enough to say that one country expends such-and-such a sum on its military        and naval budget, and that another does not spend so much.  Equality of expenditure        is not always a proof of equality of strength.  A country which has no enemies, and which,        by its natural frontiers and by its distance from all the battlefields of the  world, has        nothing to fear, is not so likely to have a strong army as a country which has enemies, or
             &quot;The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the        reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and.        the enforcement by common action of international obligations.             &quot;The  Council,  taking  account  of  the  geographical situation and special cir-        cumstances of each State, shall formulate plans for such reduction for the consideration        and action of the several Governments.&quot;    Such are the considerations which decided the Second Assembly to beg that each of the Govern-ments  should  &quot;furnish a statement  of the  considerations  it may wish to urge in regard to therequirements of  its  national  security,  its international obligations, its geographical situationand its special conditions&quot;.    Up to the present, twenty-four Governments have answered:Albania                        Great Britain                  NetherlandsAustria                        Greece                        NorwayBelgium                        Haiti                         PolandBulgaria                       Italy                         Serb-Croat-Slovene StateCzechoslovakia                 Japan                        SiamEsthonia                       Latvia                        South AfricaFinland                        Lithuania                     SwedenFrance                         Luxemburg                   Switzerland (&apos;)     r. Consideration of these statements as a whole  has clearly  revealed, not  only the sinceredesire of the Governments to reduce national armaments and the corresponding expenditure to aminimum, but also the importance of the results already achieved.  These facts are indisputable,and are confirmed, moreover, by the replies received from Governments to the Recommendationof the Assembly regarding the limitation of military expenditure.     It is no doubt regrettable that in their statements all the Governments have not suppliedequally precise information regarding their land, sea and air armaments; for, while it is  necessaryto draw a distinction between these armaments for the purpose of the investigations now in progress,it is not possible to consider them apart from one another when they are regarded from the impor-tant point of view of national security.     2. The  second conclusion which we have been obliged to draw is that  real difficulties of atemporary or  permanent nature stand in the way of that reduction in armaments which is uni-versally  desired.   The consideration of these difficulties permits at least of certain definite factsbeing brought out regarding points which deserve the attention of the League  of Nations., ,     Certain Governments, in their statements, have considered with special care the geographical,demographical and economic aspects of armaments which are of a nature to  assist the 3rd Sub-Committee in its statistical enquiry.     Their views as to the length and nature of frontiers, extent of territory, situation of vitalcentres,  arrangement of communications and situation with regard to the  great internationalhighways, bring into clear relief both the  importance of these factors in the defensive organisationof States and the difficulty of indicating by means of mathematical formulas the influence whichmust be assigned to them.  The  same holds good  with  regard to the considerations which refer tohistory and  the lessons which must be learned from it.     The Statistical Sub-Committee&apos;s opinion that the year 1921 could not be regarded as a normalyear from the point of view of the reorganisation of  armed forces is also confirmed.  SeveralGovernments have,  indeed, called attention to the important modifications which  were being-made at the time when they were drawing up their replies, and pointed out that in all cases thesemodifications were intended to lead to a  reduction of armaments and that their armaments weresolely for defensive purposes.     3. However, even before this reorganisation has been effected, it is possible to note that thereis a marked  tendency towards a scale of armaments lower than that of 1913, and which  even nowcomplies with the recommendation of the First Assembly that  &quot;the first steps  towards a reductionof armaments should be taken without delay.&quot;     The consideration of these statements shows indeed the extent of the reductions in armamentswhich have already been carried out:     Italy has disbanded 88 battalions and reduced the period of military service.    France  has  reduced the period of military service by  half, and  disbanded 400 companies and 100 squadrons, a reduction  equivalent to  about  200,000  men.1 See the text of these Statements in Annex II.        which has had, or may have, enemies.- The element of national security must therefore        enter into the scope of enquiries of the Sub-Committee.&quot;    Such considerations inspired, no doubt, Article 8 of the Covenant, the first two  paragraphs of which are to the effect that:
     Poland has reduced her army since 1920 from 960,000 to 260,000 men.     Japan reports a reduction without giving figures.     Sweden has reduced the period of military service by half.     Switzerland has reduced the number of men declared fit for service from 70 to 55 %.     We may perhaps recall here the information which it would have been interesting to find in the statements of all the naval Powers, namely, the reduction in their war tonnage as  compared with that in existence or in course of construction at the date of the Armistice; these reductions amount to 55 % in the case of Great Britain, 41  % in the case of Italy, 59 % in the case of Japan, and 36 % in the case of France. 1     4.  The resolution of the Assembly required statements to be made in regard to the international obligations created by the Treaties of Peace.   These obligations, indeed, only concern a limited number of States, but they are sufficiently heavy and absorb  in the case  of Great Britain more than 27,000 men,  and in the case of France 160,000 men, or nearly one quarter of her army.  And not one of the  least difficulties of the problem  is the  necessity of reconciling the new burdens imposed  by the  Treaties of Peace  with the  aim which they pursue in another direction: the reduction of armaments.     In  this connection,  in  view  of. the  essentially  political character of the problem of the reduction  of armaments, the especial importance attached by all the Governments to political factors must be emphasised.     Their importance  is  increased  by the unrest which still reigns as a  result of the sweeping changes which have recently been made in the map of Europe.     The idea which predominates in certain States, such as France, Belgium  and Poland, is to obtain  the execution of the Treaties on which depend their economic reconstruction and their national security or existence.   Some of the States mentioned above, as well as others, such as the Baltic States, are  alarmed by the proximity of large countries, such as Russia  and Germany, which are not Members  of the League of Nations.  The execution of the Treaties of Peace, on which depends the future of Europe, may be  said to be the primary cause of the anxiety which is the chief obstacle in the way of the desire of certain Governments to reduce their national armaments.     5.  Furthermore, the Colonies play a considerable part  in determining what forces are indis- pensable to each State.  Their size, their distance, their population, the difficulties of communi- cating with them, and their internal situation are all factors which must be taken into consideration. Thus, France has fixed the forces necessary for the security and  the defence  of her colonies at 205,000 men (more than a quarter of her army), while Italy draws attention to the insufficiency of the local colonial forces, and  the necessity of reinforcing  them from home should the occasion arise. Great Britain sets aside 274,000 men for the same purpose and only regards her home army as a reservoir for her overseas detachments. It would be desirable for the other States possessing colonies to furnish similar indications  in regard to the forces employed for their occupation.    6. The resolution of  the  Assembly referred to  one  more  point:  the  establishment  as far as  possible of  a distinction between the forces  intended  for the maintenance of order and the forces whose purpose was to provide for defence against an attack from outside. As might be anticipated, this distinction cannot be absolute. The majority of the Governments have indi- cated the forces which they judge to be indispensable for the maintenance of order and have speci- fied that they were composed in part of police forces or specialized gendarmerie whose cost of upkeep was high, and that they partly relied on the utilisation, if necessary,  of the army. But there are profound differences of organisation in the different countries.  Thus, Italy has at her disposal a force of 120,000 men (carabiniers, Royal Guard of Public Safety, and customs officials);  France has 23,000 gendarmes, to be reinforced if  necessary by  100,000 men from the army;  while  Poland provides for the employment of 60,000 men, Esthonia 1,500, Latvia 5,000, Albania 2,098, Haiti 2,533, and South Africa 10,250.    Other States,  such as Finland, Lithuania and Bulgaria,  make no distinction between military and police forces.  Japan reckons its police  forces on a basis of one man per 300 to 800 inha- bitants  in  towns, and per  600 to 2,000  inhabitants in the country. Belgium states that her gendarmery has  always been sufficient for  the maintenance of order, but that it is of no account as a military force. These differences in the organisation of police forces are reflected in the methods of calculating the expenses of their  upkeep, either in the war  budget, as in France, or in other budgets, as in Italy, for example.    Moreover, nearly every State has  made known the minimum force  which it considers  as indispensable, on the  one hand, for the maintenance of order, and on the other for the formation of its peace-time army. Some countries justify their military organisation by basing themselves,not on their peace-time armaments, but  on the potential military strength of their possible adver- saries.    7. Finally, in reply to the question of the Assembly in regard to her &quot;special circumstances&quot;, Greece argued that the prolongation of the state of war with Turkey  did not allow her to decide what forces would be necessary for her security once peace was re-established; Luxemburg observedthat her security depended on the respecting of  the Treaties and of her neutrality; Siam pointed out the  numerous works of public utility carried out by her  army; Austria merely referred to the definite obligations imposed by the Treaty of Trianon; Bulgaria renewed her request for a modi-  1 When the naval tonnage  has been reduced to the replacement tonnage  provided for in the Treaty of washington, these percentages will become : Great Britain 59%, France 50%, Italy 43%, Japan 57%.
fixation of the military organisation imposed upon her by the Treaty of Peace, as being impossiblefor her to carry out.    8. The foregoing considerations have, in most cases, been supplemented by a. short summaryof the important difficulties in the situation of the various countries  as regards their industrial capacity  and their economic development.  These observations have been rendered necessary onaccount of the character  which modern warfare has assumed and  of the essential part whichindustrial factors  play  in such warfare.    9. Most Governments have concluded their reports by a statement as to their military expen-diture and the reductions, often very considerable,  which they have been able  to effect.    In short, these reports, with one or two exceptions, have generally dealt with the differentpoints raised in the Resolution of the Assembly:                 National security,                 International  obligations,                 Geographical  situation,                 Special  circumstances,.                 Police forces, military forces and corresponding expenditure.    Some of these statements are incomplete; but the data which  they furnish, taken as a whole,have lifted the problem out of the sphere of pure theory, and provide a solid basis for the laboursof the League.    By making it clear to what an essential degree this is a problem of a political nature, ratherthan a technical one, they have shown the value of statistical enquiry in  its true light. They providea precise  conception of that potential military  force which, on account of the character assumed bywarfare between nations in arms, each State possesses below the  only visible  surface of its peace-time armaments    a potential force which  depends upon factors  so diverse  and so variable,bound up as they are with its history, its geography, its economic  development and  even withits peculiar national character, that it can never be adequately expressed in figures.    Almost all the Governments who have replied indicate the point beyond which, under presentcircumstances, they cannot go in the matter of disarmament without  clanger to themselves  andto the peace of the world.  They emphasise the difficulties which they are still encountering andwhich hinder the execution of their clearly expressed intentions; but as these difficulties are above all of a political nature, it  may be hoped that the League of Nations will be able to assist them indiminishing  and  in finally eliminating  them.Exchange of Information.    It may be of interest to point out that, on the whole, these statements, which the various governments had been asked to furnish for wholly different reasons, constitute in fact &quot;an inter-change of information&quot;  not  unlike that which is suggested in the last paragraph of Article 8 ofthe Covenant.  The attention of the Commission has thus been drawn to this article.    On the proposal of M. Jouhaux, the Temporary Mixed Commission has considered theadvisa-bility of  requesting the Council to consider the question of the exchange of military, naval andair information in accordance with the last paragraph of Article  8 of the Covenant.    The  Temporary Mixed  Commission has adopted on this subject the following resolution: -             &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission begs the Council to consider whether the time         has not come to  discuss the application of the paragraph of Article 8 of the Covenant         relating to  the exchange of military information between the  States Members of the         League.&quot;III.   PROPOSALS  FOR  THE  REDUCTION OF  ARMAMENTS.    During its second session  the  Assembly of the League of Nations adopted  the  followingresolution:              &quot;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be asked to make  proposals on general        lines for the reduction of national armaments, which, in order to secure precision, should        be in the form of a draft treaty or other equally definite plan, to be presented to the Council        if possible, before the Assembly next year.&quot;
    As a result of this resolution, the Temporary Mixed Commission was asked to submit to theCouncil proposals for the reduction of national armaments, in the form of a draft treaty or otherequally definite plan, as early as possible before September 4th, 1922.   &apos; In the course of the third session a definite proposal for the reduction of hind armaments,submitted by  Lord Esher,  and a draft  resolution by Rear-Admiral Segrave with the object of extending the  application of the Naval Treaty of Washington to States  Members of the League,which had not signed that  Treaty, were brought before the  Commission.  The consideration ofthese two plans was postponed by the Commission until its fourth session.    During this last session  in July last, Lord Robert Cecil submitted to the Commission a proposalfor a General Pact for Guarantees, based on mutual  assistance and intended as the preliminarycondition of a general reduction of armaments.    Lieut.-Col. Requin and the Marquis de Saluzzo also, in their turn, submitted plans for theextension of the Naval Treaty of Washington, similar to Vice-Admirals Segrave&apos;s plan.    The  Commission, therefore, found that it had before it three proposals, two relating to thereduction of land armaments (LordEsher&apos;s plan and Lord Robert Cecihs proposals), and the thirdrelating to the limitation of naval armaments (plans of Admiral Segrave, Lieut.-Col. Requin andthe Marquis de Saluzzo).1.  PLANS SUGGESTED BY LORD ESHER AND LORD ROBERT CECIL    As regards the first two proposals, the Temporary Mixed Commission decided to appoint aspecial committee to  consider Lord Esher&apos;s plan and investigate the consequences  which theapplication of Lord Robert Cecihs proposals would entail.    This Committee, composed of:                              Lord Robert CECIL (Chairman),                             Lieut.-Col.  REQUIN,                             General MARIETTI,                             M. JANSSEN,                             Col.  LOHNER and                             General INAGAKI,met in London from August 3rd to August 5th, and at Geneva on August 30th.  It  drew up areport, which the Temporary Mixed Commission adopted, and the preamble of which is reprintedbelow.    &quot;Before commencing to examine the propositions of Lord  Robert Cecil and Lord Esher, theSpecial Committee thinks that it would be useful to fix the position of this study in the general programme of the work of the Temporary Mixed Commission.    &quot;The Committee hopes that the returns supplied by the Governments will make it possibleto draw up  a preliminary table  of  the reductions in armaments which they have made, and isof opinion that the work of the Temporary Commission can, with great advantage, be continued on the basis of such returns.    &quot;The programme of the Commission will be as follows:              &quot;(1) To utilise these returns in carrying out an enquiry into the influences exercised        over the present armaments of the different States  by circumstances affecting  then-        national safety and other conditions enumerated in Article 8 of the Covenant.             &quot; (2) To continue its investigations into the means by  which the League of Nations        can induce the different Governments to consent to fresh reductions in armaments.    &quot;The Committee would classify such means under two heads:              (a) By its political action the League of Nations can  eliminate the causes leading        to the existence of certain  armed forces and thus abolish such armed forces themselves.             (b) By  the  joint  assistance  for  which the  Covenant provides, without, strictly        speaking, organising it, the League of Nations can offer certain guarantees of security        to its members.    &quot;These considerations have led the Committee, after considering Lord Esher&apos;s scheme, to notefavourably his proposal for finding a common measure by which armed forces might be estimated.This is  a technical question, which would have to  be submitted to the Permanent advisory commission for discussion.    &quot;The question raised in section f frjabove has led the Committee back to the enquiry with whichit was entrusted, namely, an  enquiry into the practical consequences involved by  the actualand complete putting into force  of the principle of mutual guarantees proposed by Lord robert cecil.   The Committee, recognising  that this  proposal is in accordance with  the spirit  of theCovenant, and was made with a view to rendering the mutual assistance  implied by the Cove-nant really effective, declared itself  in complete sympathy with the spirit of Lord Robert CecrTs
proposal.   In submitting this report to the Temporary Mixed Commission, the Committee wouldlike to emphasise the fact that nothing in this report should in any way affect the complete validity of all Treaties of Peace or other existing inter-State agreements.   For this reason, the committee did not think fit to express an opinion with regard to the respective value, from the point of viewof the maintenance of peace, of the general proposals submitted to it for consideration and ofthe existing regional defensive agreements for securing the maintenance  of peace recognised inArticle 21 of the Covenant.&quot;(a)   Lord Esher&apos;s Scheme.    Lord Esher&apos;s proposal, submitted to the deliberations of the Temporary Mixed commission at its third meeting in February 1922, is printed below.    &quot;In  the report of the Third Committee (dated September 27th, 1921) of the Assembly of theLeague  of  Nations,  the following  recommendation was adopted:             &apos;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be  asked to make proposals on  general         lines for the reduction of national armaments, which, in order to secure precision, should         be in the form of a draft  treaty or  other equally definite plan, to be presented to the         Council if possible before the Assembly next  year.&apos;    &quot;I do  not believe that it would be profitable to draft a treaty.  The alternative,  however,which is  to draw up  an &apos;equally definite plan,&apos; is well within the competence  of the TemporaryMixed Commission.  The valuable information, statistical and other, collected by the Sub-Com-mittee, enable this attempt to be made.  Its urgency is manifest if the work of the Commissionin a concrete and practical form is to  be presented  to the Assembly this year.    &quot;In  venturing to propose the following draft Resolutions as a basis of discussion, I have not thought it necessary to mention the suggestions   such, for example, as a budget basis of compari-son - - which do not appear  to be  capable of practical application.    &quot;The Resolutions which I desire to lay before the Commission for their consideration at their next session are as follows:             &quot;(1) That the size of standing armies in time of peace should be  restricted on a         numerical  basis.             &quot;(2) That the restriction  should be fixed  by ratio, following the naval precedent         at  Washington.             &quot;(3) That the ratio should be confined to metropolitan forces,  leaving each country         to  fix  the forces required  by it for colonial and  overseas  defence.             &quot;(4) That within six months of the ratification of  a treaty  fixing the ratio, the High         Contracting  Parties  shall reduce their  standing  military  and air  forces maintained         within the metropolitan area in times of peace to the scale  set forth  in paragraph         9, and shall agree that the scale will not be exceeded.for  a period of ten years.             &quot;(5) That the term standing military  and air forces&apos;  shall be held to include  all         military and air personnel  of all ranks serving either voluntarily or compulsorily in the         metropolitan  areas,  with the  regular military and air forces,  all  police forces  perma-         nently armed, and all permanent staffs of reserve or  territorial forces, but  shall not         include the reserve  or territorial forces.             &quot;(6) That the Permanent Advisory Commission of the League shall be reconstituted         and strengthened, under a Chairman to be appointed by the Government of the French         Republic.             &quot;(7) That it shall be  the duty of the  Permanent Advisory Commission to report         to the League any infringement of  the  Treaty embodying these agreements,  and to         prepare such plans  as may be necessary for its enforcement.             &quot;(8) That the Permanent Advisory Commission be authorised to nominate naval,         military and air attaches,  who shall  be  given by  the  Governments to which they are         accredited such facilities and information regarding armaments as may  from time to         time be required by the  Commission.             &quot;(9) That the fixed ratio of the standing military and air forces shall be as follows,         taking 30,000 men of all ranks as the unit:Belgium  .  .  .CzechoslovakiaDenmark   .  .France  . .  .  .Great Britain   .Greece  . .  .  .Italy2       Netherlands    .....33       Norway   .......   22       Poland .  .   .  ...  .  .   46       Portugal.......13       Roumania   .  .  .  .  .  .   33       Sweden   .   .  .  .  .  .  .   24       Spain   .  ...  .  .  ...   3Serb-Croat-Slovene State  3       Switzerland ......   2.    &quot; N.B.   The forces of Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary to remain  as  defined inthe Treaty  of  Peace.&quot;
    This proposal was not discussed by the T. M. G. until its fourth session in July 1922.  TheCommission appointed a Sub-Committee to examine  the scheme, and, at the same time, pro-posed that the technical aspect of the question be submitted to the Permanent Advisory Corn-mission.  This was agreed to by the Council, and the latter Commission transmitted  throughthe Council the technical opinion asked fo&quot;r.  The Temporary Mixed Commission, in the courseof its 5th  session,  having heard the Permanent Advisory Commission^ opinion,  as well as amemorandum by Lord Esher suggesting  a  postponement  of the  consideration of his scheme,adopted  the Sub-Committee&apos;s report,1 including  the following resolutions:             &quot;The Commission cannot approve Lord Esher&apos;s scheme, but is of opinion that the idea         suggested in  the scheme of fixing a method  of  estimating peace-time  strengths  is         justified.             &quot;It believes that the limitation  of armaments must be imposed on the peace-time         strength, bearing in mind the essential  factors  on  which such strength is based.             &quot;It is of opinion that this limitation should not apply to forces that are not utilised         for the defence  of  the  metropolitan  area of each State.             &quot;Finally,  it  is  of opinion that a special supplementary  agreement should  be         contemplated for&apos; the  limitation  of  forces used to  maintain  order and in the defence         of colonial possessions.&quot;(b)  Lord  Robert CeciPs Proposals.    Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s proposals, as they were adopted by the Temporary Mixed  Commission,are as follows:     &quot;1.  No scheme for the reduction of armaments can ever be really successful unless it is general.    &quot;2.  In the present state of the world, the majority of Governments would be unable to acceptthe responsibility for  a serious reduction of armaments unless they received in exchange a satis-factory guarantee of  the safety of  their  countries.    &quot;3.  Such a guarantee can be found in a general defensive agreement between all the countries concerned, binding them to provide immediate  and  effective  assistance  in accordance with a pre- -arranged plan in the event of one of them being attacked, provided that the obligation to render assistance to a country attacked shall be limited in principle to those countries situated in the samepart of the globe. In cases , however, where, for historical, geographical, or other reasons, a countryis in special danger of attack, detailed arrangements should be made for  its defence in accordancewith  the above-mentioned  plan.    &quot;4.  It is understood that the whole of the above resolutions are conditional on a reduction ofarmaments being carried out on lines laid down beforehand, and on the provision of effective machinery to ensure  the realization and  the maintenance  of such a reduction.&quot;    Having taken note of the report of the Sub-Committee mentioned above, the Commissiondecided to  approve  these proposals,  and to adopt the following draft presented by the Committeeon  the consequences  of the scheme  if it were applied:     &quot;1.  At its third session at Paris, the Temporary Mixed Commission referred to its Second Sub-Commission four resolutions, based on the principles  that disarmament to be effective must be general, and that no State could be expected to reduce its armaments unless it were given reasonablesecurity  that, by doing so,  it would not expose  its people  to aggression, from outside.   In other words, the resolutions recognized that  the establishment of mutual confidence is an  essential condition of the reduction of armaments and that it involves the conclusion of a Treaty of mutual guarantee  among all  States  which  agree  to reduce their armaments.    &quot;2.  The purpose of such a Treaty of mutual guarantee cannot be to provide absolute securityfrom  attack from without for the States which agree to it. In a prolonged war, it is certain that each of the belligerents will mobilize and put into the field the whole of its national strength,whether it has agreed, before the outbreak of war, to a reduction of armaments or not. To guarantee to  every State  absolute security against the results  of a long war is not practicable.   In thismatter, as in all questions connected with the reduction of armaments, it  is  essential to keepclearly in mind the distinction between the two  periods into which a  war, which resulted froman act of aggression occurring after a general and mutual reduction of armaments, would be divided.    &quot;The first period, which may be called Period A, would be that in which each of the belli-gerents would put into the field only those forces which it had been able, under its reduction agree-ment, to prepare in time of peace.   The second period, which may be called  Period B,  wouldbe that in which steps would be taken to put into the field forces mobilized and trained after theoutbreak of  war.   The first period  would  probably be of a few months&apos;  duration; the second would begin with the entry of the first war-trained troops, and would continue until each belli-gerent had mobilized  its full national strength.    &quot;In  order to render a real reduction of armaments possible, the mutual guarantee must be such as would prevent a State from being totally defeated during Period A.  In this connection it is important to remember that, in view of  the international  guarantee, by the mere fact of ageneral and mutual reduction of armaments, every Power would enjoy a measure of security similarto that which it possessed before such general and mutual reduction took place.  In the second1 See Annex III.
place, it must be noted that the guarantee given by the States which would support any Stateattacked would  create a very dangerous  situation for an  aggressor.   If the guarantee were to prove as effective as the Committee hopes, it would be almost certain that that aggressor would beoverwhelmed during Period A, and in this way the purpose of the guarantee would be  achieved.    &quot;3. Just as confidence on the part of Governments and peoples is essential to the effectivecarrying through of  a reduction of armaments, so for the prevention of unjustified attack it isnecessary that a possible aggressor should fully realise the consequences which his aggressive action would bring upon him.   The Committee therefore considers it desirable that a Treaty of mutual guarantee,  if drawn  up,  should include a clear statement  to the effect that the purpose of theTreaty is:             (a)  To  ensure that the aggressor  shall in the long run have no chance of victory.             (b)  To  ensure that the aggressor shall not be able, by  sudden military action, to         achieve his purpose and to present the League of Nations and the signatory States with         a  fait accompli.             (c) To  make  a possible aggressor realise that  the signatory States will not only         defend  the  State  which is  attacked,  but will also take the offensive  and punish the         attacker if the latter has  violated Article 13 of the Covenant.    &quot;4.  If the  above principles are to  be effective, a  solution  must  be found for the twoproblems, and the necessary machinery provided:             (a) When an outbreak of war has occurred, there must be some means of determining,         within  the briefest  possible  delay, which State is the aggressor.  Machinery must be         found by which this decision can be taken within a delay of not more than four clays.             (b)  Machinery must  be  devised by means of which material military aid can be         brought without the delay which might prove fatal to the State which  is attacked.    &quot;5.  For  determining the State which is the aggressor, the Committee suggests the follow-ing plan:             (a)  The Council of the League must decide which State is the aggressor.             (.6)  The Council should not be obliged to take a unanimous decision, as the unfavour-         able vote of one State might prove fatal to the State attacked.   The Committee sug-         gests that the Council should be able to take the required decision by a  strong majority,         eg., three-quarters. -             (c)  The Council should take the decision at the earliest possible moment, not exceed-         ing four days from  the date when the Secretary-General received notice.             (d)  The decision which the Council has to take is not on the merits of the dispute         between the States concerned  but on  the question as to which of them has committed         the  first act of  war. It should,  therefore, be laid down by the Treaty that whichever         State has deliberately violated the  territory  of the other State shall be deemed to be         the aggressor.             (e)  For  the purpose of deciding which State is the aggressor, the Council might, if         necessary, send  an expert commission to  enquire into the  facts of the  situation on the         spot, and to report immediately.    &quot;6.  For the purpose of bringing, without undue delay, effective military assistance to a state which was  attacked, the Committee suggests that the following principles may be laid down:             (a)  It is not possible  to prepare in advance detailed military plans for international         action,  accepted by all the States entering into a Treaty of Mutual Guarantee,  to repel         aggression in. every conceivable  case.             (b)  It is not even possible to  establish an international general staff to consider such         plans in advance.             (c)  The Permanent Advisory Commission  cannot serve in  any way as an  inter-         national staff.             (d)  It is also  important to bear in mind that if a general and mutual reduction of         armaments is carried through, the forces of an aggressor  State will not be unopposed,         but  will immediately be met by  an army of the country which is attacked and which,         during  period A at least, should be able to make some defence.    &quot;7. The  Committee therefore  suggests machinery based on the following lines:             (a)  An appeal to the League might come in the first place from the State which is         attacked or from any State which i-egards itself as in a dangerous international position.         This State should approach the Council of the League, stating :             the danger  against which it  should be protected;             the forces which it can itself provide to meet the danger during period A;             the total forces which it required during Period A to enable it to defeat the enemy;             and from what States it proposes that these forces should be drawn.             (b)  It would be within the power  of the general staff of such a State to make plans         in advance for the utilisation of the forces to be provided by the  other  signatory States         to meet any given contingency which they may foresee.  This will expedite the effective         use of such forces.
            (c)  The  Council, with  the  assistance  of the Permanent Advisory Commission,        should consider the demands put forward by the threatened State and should consider        whether these demands are reasonable  and practicable.   If  so, they should  be  for-        warded immediately by the Council to the Governments of the States concerned, with an        invitation to these States to make provision for the forces required.            (d)  A military Power should be put in charge of the organisation of  the assistance        to be brought by the guarantor States to the State which is attacked.            This Power might either be the Power which is attacked itself or another Power.            The Council,  advised by  the  Permanent Advisory Commission,  should give the        necessary mandate to the Power which it considers best fitted to carry out the task.            (e)  The form of assistance may vary in each particular case; but the attention of the        Temporary Mixed Commission is drawn to the following:                i. Various forms of economic pressure are provided for in the Covenant, and        can be readily applied.                2. In the case of armed assistance, certain forces, such as aircraft and warships,            are the most readily available,  and, therefore,  the  most likely to be asked for and            to be effective in the initial stages of the war;                 3. The availability and time of intervention of land forces will  depend on the            extent to which preliminary arrangements have  been  made  possible.    &quot;8. Resume.   As has already been  pointed out,  the  object of the above is to enableStates to reduce  their armaments, while providing for them a measure of security at least as great as that which they now enjoy.    &quot;The following steps are, therefore, desirable:            1.  The conclusion  of a general agreement between States to furnish support against        an aggressor; this agreement should be not less binding than a similar one made between        State and State;            2.  The reduction of their armaments within limits which shall leave national security        unimpaired, not only for one State but for all other Signatory States.    &quot;Unless the agreement to furnish support is incorporated in a definite plan of support, framedto meet possible contingencies within a  certain time, it will not have the binding nature that such agreements have between State and State; it will not be regarded with confidence; and the wholeobject of the Treaty,  the  reduction  of armaments, will not be  achieved. The Assembly should give its opinion  on the following point, an opinion on which Governments will have to decide:It is important that it should be recognised  that, to  achieve these purposes, -the  States entering into the obligations of this Treaty will require  to maintain certain elements of armed  forces foruse at the call of the Council of the League.&quot;2. PROPOSALS FOR THE EXTENSION  OF THE PRINCIPLES  OF THE WASHINGTON  NAVAL TREATY                   TO NON-SIGNATORY STATES  MEMBERS OF THE  LEAGUE.     As stated above,  the  Commission,  during its last two sessions, had considered three schemesaiming at the extension of the principles of the Washington Treaty to the non-signatory Powers,presented respectively by Admiral Segrave, Marquis de  Saluzzo and  Lieut.-Col. Requin.     Generally speaking, the Commission declared itself in favour of the extension of the principlesof the  Washington Treaty to non-signatory States, and, on account of the technical nature  ofthe  three drafts that were submitted to it,  requested the Council to refer them to the Per-manent Advisory  Commission for examination by its Naval Sub-Commission.     The Commission also requested the Council to bring these proposals to the notice of Membersof the League of Nations; this has been done by  document  C. L. 84, 1922, IX.     At its session of July 1922, held in London, the Council invited the Naval Sub-Commissionto present its report as soon as possible and to forward it direct to the Second  Sub-Committee of the  Temporary Mixed  Commission.     The Naval  Sub-Commission met in Geneva on July 24th, under the chairmanship of Admiral the Marquis of Magaz, the Spanish Naval Representative.   It has amalgamated the three schemesthat were put before it, in conformity with the  resolution of the Council, and has forwarded  its report  of July 27th, 1922, to the Members of the Council, as well as to the Members of the Second Sub-Commission of the Temporary Armaments  Commission.     The Report of the Naval  Sub-Commission  is printed  below:     &quot;The Washington Treaty amounts  to a carrying-out of the principles of limitation of arma- ments  enunciated in the  Covenant, so far as the  signatory Powers are concerned.     &quot;The main obstacle which, up to the date of the above Agreement, prevented the Permanent Advisory Commission from dealing with the reduction of Naval  Armaments, was the fact that  all great Powers are not Members  of the League (see Permanent Advisory  Commission, Report to the Council, dated  December 4th,  1920).  The  signature of the Washington Treaty has,  however, now removed this obstacle to progress.     &quot;At the  outset of the Commission^ deliberations, it  became clear that there was a certain divergence of view as to  the principles upon which an extension of the  Washington  Treaty to
non-signatory Members of the League should be based. The majority of the Members, consistingof the Representatives of the signatory Powers of the Washington Treaty, was of opinion thatthe Convention should be mainly based upon the principles of maintaining the stakes quo.    &quot;The Representatives of Spain and Brazil (the former speaking in a purely personal capacity),however, held the view that the principle of the status quo was neither the most important northe most  acceptable basis of the proposed Convention.  In their view this principle should be subordinated to the principles of national security (which, they pointed out, had been expresslyrecognised at Washington by the insertion of a clause providing  for the revision  of the  treaty in the event of the national security of one of the Contracting Parties being imperilled), of geogra-phical situation, and of special circumstances. They further held that the Commission, as a bodyof the League of  Nations, was bound by the terms of Article 8 of the Covenant to fix the limit of the Naval Forces of the remaining Members of the League by means of suitable  comparisons,based upon the geographical situation and the circumstances of each State.1    &quot;The following summary of the  views of the minority was submitted  to  the Commission asa suggested  basis for  its discussions:             (i) The  signatory States of the Washington Treaty were not all Members of the         League  of Nations.   They were,  therefore, free to come to agreements without taking         account  of the provisions of the Covenant.             The only object of our meeting, on the other hand, is to give our opinion as experts         of the League of Nations, and since we are bound by the Covenant we can only act in         accordance with it.             (2) The representatives of the Powers at Washington were politicians.  They could,         therefore, base their agreements on purely arbitrary principles. We are experts, and must         therefore base our opinions  on scientific principles.             (3) Since certain States have fixed the limit for their naval armaments, we must         take it for granted that this limit is the minimum compatible with their national safety.         Otherwise, under Article 8 of the Covenant, they would be obliged still further to reduce         their armaments.             Our only task, therefore, is to fix the limit of the  armed forces of the remaining         Members of the League by means of suitable comparisons based on geographical position         and on the conditions laid down in Article 8 of the Covenant.             Should these limits not be acceptable for political reasons, it would be the  task of         the politicians to  alter them.    &quot;When the Commission rejected these propositions by four votes to  two, Admiral Penido,Representative of Brazil, found himself unable to co-operate further  in the examination  of thevarious draft schemes before the Commission, in view of the fact that they were not, in his opinion,compatible with the requirements of the geographical situation, the special circumstances,&apos; andthe security of his  country.  He, therefore, abstained from further participation in the variousvotes taken during the discussion  of the Commission.    &quot;With the object of devising a formula which should, as  far as possible, comprise the viewsof all Members of the Commission, the French Representative, on behalf of the representativesof the signatory  Powers, brought forward proposals embodying the  principles upon which theConvention  should  be based.  After discussion, these proposals were  agreed to in  the followingform  as a preamble to the draft Convention:             The Commission, being of opinion that:             1. In  the absence of exact information with regard to the special requirements of         each State, it was not possible for them to find a more practical basis for estimating         replacement tonnage than the status quo  on November 12th, 1921, which  was the basis         adopted at Washington;             2. There was  also no occasion for them to propose modifications of the principle         of the status quo at the present moment, in view of the fact that only two of the States         concerned are represented at the present Session of the Naval Sub-Commission of the         Permanent Advisory Commission and that, consequently, only those two States could be         in a position to put forward their views as to the special circumstances of their respective         countries;             3. It  would be difficult at this moment  to fix the  tonnage for States which have         come into existence since the war;             Are agreed:             That just as for special reasons and in well-defined cases it was laid down in the         Washington  Treaty  that  certain  exceptions  to  the  general  principle contained         therein  should  be allowed,  so, when  the International Conference, which is to settle         finally  the conditions under which the scheme is  to be applied, is convened, account         should be taken of the particular needs and conditions put forward by each State with         a view to making  such modifications in this scheme as may appear justified.         (     &quot;At the same time the Representatives of the four signatory Powers drew up  a single DraftConvention based on the three drafts originally referred to the Commission.&apos; Detailed declarations by these two Members are attached. See Annex IV.
    &quot;After discussion, the  Spanish  Representative  declared his ability to accept the suggestedPreamble and the Draft Convention subject to the following reservations:             (i) His remarks did not bind his Government.   He was speaking purely personally.             (2) Subject to this reservation, he accepted the Draft Convention with the exception         of the note to Article 4.             (3) He made reservations on the subject of the tonnage allocated to Spain.    &quot;The Commission, therefore, having studied the drafts put before it, as well as the generalaspects of the subject, is enabled to  submit to the Council the accompanying Draft  Convention1embodying proposals  for the extension of the Washington Treaty to other States Members of theLeague.    &quot;This Draft Convention deals only with those sections  of naval armaments which form thesubject of the Washington Treaty.   This fact confines the direct limitation of total tonnage tothose States which at the present moment possess capital ships (see Chapter II, Part 1).    &quot;It may here be said that the definition of a capital ship for the  purpose of this Convention isa vessel which exceeds 10,000 tons&apos;  displacement or which carries a gun with a  calibre in excessof 8 inches (203 mm.).    &quot;There are, however, certain provisions in the Washington Treaty and in this Draft Conven-tion which limit the size and armament of other ships, preparations  made in merchant ships intime of peace for conversion to war purposes, etc.   The Commission, consequently, considers, inaddition to the above-mentioned States, all Members of the League whose  armaments are not already fixed by the Washington Treaty should also be parties to the Convention.     &quot;In the list of signatories thus obtained will be found certain States whose naval armamentsare already fixed under Article 1 of the Covenant of the League of Nations or by the Peace Treaties;it is not suggested that the limitations laid down in this Draft Convention should supersede those already agreed to  by these States, but that they should be accepted by the said States in so faras they are applicable and are additional to the limitations already accepted.     &quot;The Convention itself is, of course, based entirely  on the Washington Treaty, which has been altered as necessary for the purpose in view.   The main  difference is  that, whereas the washington treaty was, first,  a Treaty to carry out definite reductions of  the  large navies, and, secondly,  aTreaty to impose limitations for the future, this Convention can only be One imposing future limi-tations,  and so eliminating the unknown factor and preventing competition in navies or the fearof such competition.     &quot;This results from  the fact that  the States concerned  have already quite a small tonnage  ofcapital ships, and, consequently, as the limitations on existing tonnage only apply to capital ships,it is hardly practicable to propose any immediate reduction or sensational scrapping. Hence, themain idea of this Convention is the elimination of the unknown and the prevention of futurecompetition or the fear of such competition.     &quot;The principle of the Naval Holiday is introduced in the Chapter on Replacement; this followsthe precedent of the Washington Treaty,, one of the main achievements of which was the agree-ment to stop the construction of capital ships for ten years.     &quot;Certain Articles deal with the aircraft carrier tonnage that  may be maintained by certain powers.  It may  be objected that these proposals permit  of an  increase of tonnage,  but theyamount in fact to a limitation on future development of a new and experimental type of ship, asdid the similar clauses of the Treaty of Washington.     &quot;The Commission would here point out  that by &quot;definition&quot; an aircraft  carrier is a vessel ofover 10,000 tons&apos; displacement, and there is no limit on vessels for use with aircraft which are underthis tonnage.     &quot;Throughout the Convention the principle has been adopted of all transactions in connectionwith the Convention taking place through the Council of the League of Nations.     &quot;The Commission finally proposes that the Council should invite the States Members of theLeague of Nations to give their plenipotentiaries to the International  Conference on Naval Arma-ments the necessary powers to adhere to the &quot;Treaty for the Protection of the Lives of  Neutralsand Non-Combatants at Sea in Time of War,&quot; signed at  Washington on February 6th, 1922.&quot;     The Temporary Armaments Commission does not consider that action on its part can in anyway bind the various States to  which its members belong,  and recognises that the responsibilityfor the acceptance of any eventual  limitation of armaments must  rest entirely with the Govern-ment Representatives at the International Conference proposed, in the report of the PermanentAdvisory Commission.  At the same time, the Commission considers that the Draft Agreementannexed to this report would serve as a  suitable basis for the  discussions of this Conference,and is consequently of opinion that it should be forwarded to the States concerned for examination.The Temporary Armaments Commission therefore adopts the following resolutions:          (r) The Temporary Armaments Commission recommends that the Council should extend     the principles of the limitation  of naval armaments contained in the Washington Naval     Treaty to the States non-signatory to  that treaty who  are Members of the League.     The Temporary Armaments  Commission draws  the attention of the  Council to the     advisability of extending the same principles to those States who are not Members of the     League of Nations.         (2) The Temporary Armaments Commission  forwards to the Council the Permanent     Advisory Commission^ technical report on this  subject, together with a draft convention1 See Annex V.
with regard to the putting into force of this limitation.  It recommends that this report andthese draft agreements should be sent to the various  Governments for consideration.    (3)  The  Temporary Armaments Commission recommends that the Council and theAssembly should convene as soon as possible an international conference at which the ques-tion of the extension of the Washington Naval Treaty might be discussed, and any agree-ment which had  been decided&apos;upon regarding this limitation might be drawn tip.    (4)  The  international  conference will be  in a position to  consider what measures should be taken  with regard to States which at present do not possess any naval forces &apos;.IV,  OTHER RESOLUTIONS.                              (1)  WASHINGTON CONFERENCE.    Despite the grave political difficulties from which the world is suffering at present, the spiritof international co-operation aiming  at peace, which inspire the League of Nations, can also be observed at work in other places.   The Commission is glad to have been able to welcome duringits two last sessions two events due to this spirit.   One of them belongs- to the  past, the othermust come about in the near future.  We mean to refer to the Conference of Washington, and tothe Pan-American Congress of Santiago.    At the suggestion of the Temporary Mixed  Commission, the Second Assembly had declaredthat &quot;no complete scheme of reduction of armaments can be earned out without the co-operationof the  United States, Germany and Russia.  In particular, the naval strength of  the first-namedPower makes any scheme of naval disarmament impossible without her support, and it is for that reason, among others, that the Committee warmly welcomes the forthcoming Conference at Wash-ington, and trusts that it may be fruitful in securing a large measure of reduction of armaments.&quot;    In view of the successful conclusion of the Washington Conference, the Temporary Commissiondecided at its fourth session to express in its general report to the Council and Assembly its satis-faction at the work accomplished at Washington in connection with, the reduction of naval arma-ments.                          (2) PAN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE AT  SANTIAGO.    Upon the proposal of M. Alcala-Zamora, the Commission unanimously  adopted the followingresolution:             &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission  notes the declai-ations made at its 4th Session        by M. Rivas Vicuna, on behalf of the Chilian Government, and welcomes with interest        the Chilian Government^ intention of  submitting the question of disarmament to the        Pan-American Congress which is to meet at Santiago in March 1923.             &quot;The  Commission  expresses the hope that this Congress may. arrive at  practical        solutions capable of being  fitted into the more general scheme of disarmament which is        the subject of the Commission^ own labours:&quot;    On this subject,  M. Rivas-Vicuna made the following statement to the Committee: -             &quot;The Commission &apos;s resolution will act as a powerful stimulus to the action which the        New World proposes to undertake on the same lines with that of the Continent of Europe        and it will in particular form  a further bond of union and co-operation between countries       . which, although separated by the ocean,  cherish the same  ardent desire for peace and        justice.             &quot;While  seeking for a solution of regional problems, they do not lose sight of those        questions which affect the well-being of the nations as  a whole.             &quot;The principles on which the Covenant of the League of Nations is based, the. impor-        tant work accomplished by the Washington Conference and by the Armaments Commis-        sion itself,  will serve as a basis and will provide a valuable documentary foundation for        the work of the Pan-American Conference and will once more make clear to history the        advantages of international  co-operation.&quot;    &apos; It should.be pointed out that  in its report the P.A.C.  &quot;proposes to the Council to invite States belongingto the League of Nations on the occasion of the International Conference on Naval Armaments to give, their pleni-potentiaries the powers necessary to. adhere to the &apos;Treaty on the Protection of the Lives of Neutrals and Non-Combatants at Sea in Time of War&apos; signed at  Washington 011 February 6th,  1922.&quot;  (Senator Roofs proposal).    The T.M.C-, taking note of the above report, has only examined and retained that part which deals with thereduction of  armaments and of the draft agreement annexed thereto (C- 477 and C. 477 [a]). ;.
SPECIAL  QUESTIONS.V.  DESTRUCTION  OF SURPLUS STOCKS OF MUNITIONS.     The Second Assembly requested the Temporary Mixed Commission to consider  &quot;the steps&quot;that may eventually have to be taken for the destruction of the surplus stocks.&quot;     At its seventeenth session, the Council invited the Permanent Advisory Commission to under-take a preliminary investigation  of the question.     The opinion of the Permanent Advisory Commission might be summed up as follows:              &quot;In certain, ex-belligerent countries the question is entrusted under the Treaties of         Peace to Commissions of Control.             &quot;In the case of other ex-belligerent States stocks have been reduced by the Govern-         ments concerned to the minimum which, in their opinion, is indispensable for national         mobilisation.  At present an increase in stocks of munitions is of far less importance for         a State than the development  of its plans for an eventual industrial mobilisation.&quot;             To sum up,  the  Commission notes that the  question has already been settled by         the various countries concerned and that the surplus stocks which undoubtedly existed         at  the close of the world-war have, during the three and a-half years which have elapsed         since that date, been destroyed or liquidated, or are in process of liquidation.             At the close of its fourth session the President of the Temporary Mixed  Commission         submitted to the Council the following conclusions which were  adopted by the latter         on July 20th, IQ22:                  &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission took   note  of the report  of the  Per-             manent Commission and  of the satisfactory measures taken by the various States             for the liquidation  of these stocks. This first question has been settled in accordance             with the desire of  the Second Assembly.&quot;VI.  USE OF TOXIC GAS IN WAR.i.  PUBLICATION OF DISCOVERIES.       The following resolution was adopted by the  Second Assembly:                 &quot;That the Temporary Mixed Commission be asked to examine whether it is ad vis-            able to address an appeal to the scientific men of the world to publish their discoveries            in poison gas and similar subjects, so as to minimise the likelihood of their being used            in any future  war.&quot;.       The Temporary Mixed Commission considered the question at their 3rd, 4th and5thSessions.   At the  4th Session it was decided to  ask the Committee on Intellectual Co-operation to advise   &quot; as to  the methods by which the co-operation of scientific men might be enlisted in carrying outink the Resolution of the Assembly.&quot;       The Committee on Intellectual Co-operation at a meeting held on 5th August, 1922, adopted   the following Resolution:                 &quot;The Committee on Intellectual Co-operation regrets its inability to suggest methods            by which scientific men throughout the world can be induced to publish their discoveries            concerning poisonous  gases  and  the development  of chemical warfare.&quot;
     At their 5th Session  the  Temporary Mixed Commission again considered the matter and.arrived at the conclusion that an appeal of this nature is not a practical measure and wouldnot  achieve the objects  aimed at.     The main reasons which led the Commission to these conclusions may be summarised as fol-lows:             (a)  Publication of discoveries would probably have results contrary to the general         trend of legislation in the world,  which is to regulate and control the distribution of         lethal weapons both for internal use in a State and for export (see Arms Traffic Convention         1919 and  recent State  domestic  legislation).             (b) Any invention with regard to the use of gas to be employed in war must be tested         on a large scale.  This can only be done by  scientists who work under government orders         and  with   government  subsidies.  Such scientists  would  naturally  be   above  all         experts in this work and in so far as  they work under government orders, would, of         course, carry out their investigations under an absolute pledge of secrecy to the govern-         ment  which they serve.             It can only be hoped, therefore, that the less dangerous inventions  will be published         and this course would be worse, than no publication at all since it would tend to produce         a certain  feeling  of  false security.             (c)  Even if the really important  inventions were published by  the scientists of         some countries, there could  be  no method of  ensuring that the same should be  done         by all. The effect of  this would be, in the event  of war, to place those countries who         responded  to the appeal at a disadvantage as compared with those who did not,because         the latter would have the advantage  of the  discoveries  of the  former while  retaining         their own for themselves.     The Temporary  Mixed Commission consequently adopts the  following resolution:             &quot;The  Temporary Mixed Commission  considers that no useful purpose would  be.         served by the addressing of an appeal to the scientific men of the world to publish their         discoveries in poison gas and similar subjects and are of opinion that it is not  advisable         to make such an appeal.  -             &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission further consider that, even if such an appeal were         made, it would not achieve the object aimed at  by the Assembly i.e. to minimise the         likelihood  of their being used in  any  future war.&quot;     Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that  there was  another step which might usefully be taken,and  he has described  it in the  following words:      &quot;It is very  much to be hoped  that the use of  gas in future warfare may not be resorted  to.But  it is at least possible that this may  happen and if so it is certain that the gases which wouldbe used in any future warfare will be  far more deadly in effect than those hitherto known.     &quot;Nor is poison gas the only example of the future development of chemical warfare; explosivesgrow yearly in strength and destructive effect; bombs which in the late war were regarded as for-midable are already of insignificant power  compared to those which will be used in future warsand  there is the whole department of bacteriological attack which  may be developed as  scienceprogresses.     &quot;It is of great importance that the peoples of the world should realise before it is too late whatthose new methods  of warfare will mean in future, not only to the armies in the field, but to thecivil population  at home.   Partial statements have  been made in technical works by individuals.But  no  authoritative  exposition of the whole subject is available.     &quot;It  isthought that a small committee  could collect, partly from existing  publications andpartly by  enquiries  from experts, the facts necessary for  such an exposition without trendingupon any secrets or giving information which  might be utilised in undesirable ways.  What iswanted is not information as to the  technical methods by which these things  can be made oremployed,  but as to what will be the result of their manufacture and use.&quot;     The Temporary Mixed Commission therefore decided to appoint a small committee to investi-gate and report  upon this subject.  2.  PROPOSALS AIMING AT EXTENDING TO NON-SIGNATORY STATES THE PRINCIPLES OF THE                      WASHINGTON TREATY RELATING TO POISON GAS.    At its meeting in Paris on July 3rd to 7th, 1922, the Temporary Mixed Commission considered a proposal that the Members of the League should be urged to adhere to the Washington Treatyconcerning the use of poison gas in war.    The provisions of this Treaty relating to the employment of gas in war are as follows:              &quot;Article  V.  The use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous  or other gases, and all         analogous liquids, materials or devices, having been justly condemned by the general ^         opinion of the civilised world and a  prohibition, of such use having been declared in         treaties to which a majority of the civilised powers are parties.             &quot;The Signatory Powers to the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted         as a part of international law binding alike the conscience  and practice of nations, declare         their assent to such prohibition, agree to be bound thereby as between themselves and         invite all other civilised nations to adhere thereto.
VII.  PRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF ARMS.    By a resolution adopted on October ist, 1921, the Temporary Mixed Commission was requested by the Second Assembly &quot;to continue the examination of the question of the private manufactureof armaments and the trade in arms&quot;.    In this connection also the Second Assembly adopted the following resolution:               &quot;That the Council be requested to invite all the Members of the League and interested         States which are not Members of the League to take part in an International Conference         on the private manufacture of arms and the trade in arms, which should meet as soon         as possible at a date to be fixed under the responsibility of the Council.  It is considered         highly desirable that this date should be prior to the next session of the Assembly.              &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission should be entrusted with the task of preparing         the programme of the Conference and of submitting to  it a draft Convention.&quot;    On July 13th, 1922, the Temporary Mixed Commission  submitted  a memorandum to  the Council of the League describing the progress  made  in the investigations undertaken by the Commission  and  in  its preparation for an  eventual Conference to deal  with private  manufac- ture.   In this memorandum the work  of the Commission already accomplished or in progress was outlined as follows:               (1)  A preliminary legal study  of the problems  which  arise in  connection with the         application of Article 8 of the Covenant has been  made  by the Legal Section  of the         Secretariat,  at the request of the Temporary Mixed  Commission.              (2)  Technical studies of the administrative, industrial  and military problems which         arise in connection with the application of Article 8 have been prepared by General         Marietti, Admiral Segrave and Colonel Carnegie,  members  of the Temporary Mixed         Commission.              (3)  The definition of the technical terms,  such  as  &quot;arms and munitions&quot;, &quot;privateI        manufacture&quot;, and similar  terms, have been studied by the Permanent Advisory Com-         mission, which has prepared a report on them.  The Temporary Mixed Commission has         accepted these definitions.              (4) Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith has submitted to the Commission a draft Convention         proposed by Lord Esher which would have the effect of requiring licences for the private         manufacture of munitions; restricting the ownership of newspapers by persons engaged         in private manufacture; and restricting the ownership of shares or interests in munition             &quot;Article VI.  The present Treaty shall be ratified as soon as possible in accordance        with the constitutional methods of the deposit of all the ratifications, which shall take        place at Washington.             &quot;The Government of the United States will transmit to  all the Signatory Powers        a certified copy of the proces-verbal of the deposit of ratifications.             &quot;The present Treaty, of which the French and English texts are both authentic,        shall remain deposited in the Archives of the Government of the United States, and duly        certified copies thereof will be. transmitted by  that Government to each of the Signatory        Powers.             &quot;Article VII.  The Government of the United States will further transmit to each        of the non-Signatory Powers a  duly  certified  copy of the present Treaty and invite its        adherence thereto.             &quot;Any non-Signatory Power may adhere to the  present Treaty by communicating        an Instrument of Adherence to the Government of the United States, which will there-        upon transmit to each of the Signatory and  Adhering Powers a certified copy of each        Instrument of Adherence.&quot;    The Commission adopted the following resolution:              &quot;The Temporary Mixed Commission considered a proposal that the Members of        the League should be urged to adhere to the Washington Treaty concerning the employ-        ment of asphyxiating and poisonous gases in war.             &quot;The Commission decided that no action should  be taken until information has been        received that the Washington Treaty has been forwarded to  the  non-Signatory States        for adhesion, after  ratification  by the Signatory  Powers.&quot;    Since the adoption of this resolution the Secretariat  has not been informed that the washington treaty has been forwarded to the non-Signatory States for adhesion. In fact, the treaty has notyet been ratified by all the  Signatory Powers, and the question remains open  until this ratificationtakes place.
         factories by foreigners.  This draft Convention is now being studied by the Temporary         Mixed Commission.             (5) A collection of the laws and administrative regulations now in force in various         countries is being made by the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and a survey of this         legislation is to be submitted to the Temporary Mixed Commission in September.             (6) Lord Robert Cecil has proposed that an enquiry be conducted to determine to         what extent the evil effects  of private manufacture exist. The Temporary Mixed Corn-         mission has  postponed any final action on  this proposal until its work has further pro-         gressed.             (7) The Temporary Mixed Commission has been furnished with information and         statistics concerning the manufacture of  arms and ammunition in the United States of         America, which has been collected by statisticians collaborating with the  International         Union of Machinists.     The Council considered that there was no occasion for immediate action on  its  part as a result of this Memorandum, and decided that when it had before it, at its September session, the results  of the various preparatory work,  it would be  in a better position than it was then to judge whether the moment had come to call forth an international conference.     Since the above report was made to the Council in July, further progress has been made in the consideration of the draft Convention proposed by Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, and on September 2, 1922, the Commission adopted the following resolution:             &quot;The Commission, having previously approved the principle of national  licences         for  private manufacture, adopts Sir Hubert  Llewellyn Smith&apos;s  project as  a basis of         consideration at the Conference  which may  consider both  private manufacture and         trade in arms.&quot;     The text of this  project is given below:     I.  For the purposes  of  the   present  draft   agreement, the term   &quot;munitions  and implements of  war&quot;  will  be understood  as meaning:  war  vessels, tanks,  artillery of all kinds, apparatus for  the discharge of all kinds of projectiles explosives or gas, flame throwers, bombs, grenades, machine  guns and rifled small-bore  breech-loading weapons  of  all  kinds.     It  includes parts exclusively used for armaments but (except as aforesaid) does not include materials or tools for their manufacture.     II. No company may engage in  the  manufacture  or sale  of armaments  without a licence from the Government of the country in which such  manufacture or sale is carried on.  Such licence shall be  conditional  on an undertaking:     (a) That neither the company nor any director  or other  person occupying a responsible position in its management, or holding a controlling interest in  the  undertaking, shall  own or hold any controlling interest in any newspaper or other  periodical publication (whether  published in the country or abroad).     (b) That the company shall keep the Government from which  it holds  the licence  fully and promptly informed of  any orders which it accepts for the supply of armaments  to  any foreign  Government or person, and that neither the  company nor its agents shall employ any disloyal means  to obtain such orders.     (c)  That (except as provided hereunder) the company is not  subject to any foreign control or influence, and that while the licence is in force, the company shall not,  without  the  previous consent of the  Government, become  subject to any such foreign control or influence.   Any such consent shall be registered with a competent authority.    Nothing in this paragraph prevents the grant of licences to armament undertakings which are subsidiary  companies  or branches of foreign armament companies,  provided that in  all such cases a clear and sufficient indication of  the existence and nature of the foreign connection shall  be given  to the  public in  the title  of the  company and on its notepaper, official publications,  catalogues, etc.     (d)  No  company  holding a licence  shall issue  any shares &quot;to bearer&quot;  which carry  any voting power, and any such shares previously issued shall lose  their voting power.    III. Every  licencee shall furnish the Government annually with a sworn  declaration in the prescribed form that all the conditions of the licence have been  fully complied with during the year to  which the Declaration refers.  A false Declaration shall be punishable by severe penalties and shall also involve liability to have the licence cancelled.    IV. If the Government is satisfied that there has been a breach of any of the  conditions ofa licence it may, after giving the licencee an opportunity of furnishing an explanation, cancel orsuspend the licence, or attach conditions to  its continuance,  provided that  the licencee  shallbe  entitled  to   appeal to  the Court  on  the  question  whether  there has been a breach of theconditions of the licence.    V. The above provisions shall apply  to  persons and  firms  as well as companies so far asapplicable thereto.    In adopting the resolution quoted above, the Committee was of the opinion  that the subjectof private manufacture could not be divorced from  the subject of traffic in arms, and as the consi-deration of the Convention of St.-Germain would have  to be resumed in another memorandum,it seems possible that the same International Conference might be called upon to deal with bothsubjects.
    Further progress has been made also in the survey of national legislation in various countriesrelating to the private manufacture of arms.  A memorandum on this legislation has been pre-pared  by the Secretariat, and the Commission has decided that it should be distributed amongthe Members of the League for criticisms and  suggestions.VIII.  ARMS  TRAFFIC CONVENTION  OF  ST.-GERMAIN.    At  both its sessions the Assembly of the League of Nations adopted Resolutions insisting on the importance of the ratification of the Arms Traffic Convention of St.-Germain.    In pursuance of the Resolution adopted at its first session, the Secretary-General addressed,on March 8th, 1921, a letter to all States Members of the League transmitting this Resolution andrequesting  them to ratify the Convention  and, if they thought  necessary, to accompany thisratification with a reservation that the Convention should not be put into effect until the other signatory Powers had also ratified it.   A similar letter was addressed to the States which had notsigned the Convention, requesting their adhesion.    Twenty-five States only replied to this  letter and the  Second Assembly accordingly adopted a fresh Resolution emphasising the importance of the ratification of the Convention of St.-Germainand expressing the earnest hope that  the Washington Conference would take similar action.    In pursuance of this Resolution the Secretary-General addressed a new letter, dated November21st, 1921, to all the States which had not stated their intentions regarding the ratification of theConvention or regarding their adhesion to it.  At present,  nine States have replied to this letter,so that  total number of Governments which have so far expressed their views on the question isnow 34 &apos;.    To this  figure  must be added Germany and her ex-allies who, by  virtue of the peace treaties, have taken the obligation to adopt  the Convention as soon as the latter enters into force.    As the situation stands at present, the following  States have ratified or adhered to the Conven-tion:              Brazil,                        Greece,                 Siam,              Chile,                         Guatemala,             Venezuela.              China,                        Haiti,              Finland,                      Peru,     Great  Britain, as well as Spain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, are prepared to ratify the Convention as soon as all the other principal Powers are willing to  do so.     France has announced that the President of the Republic has been authorised by the Chamberof  Deputies  and the Senate to ratify the Convention and  that ratification will be carried out asscon as the principal Signatory Powers shall themselves have taken steps to ratify the Convention.     Italy has expressed her readiness to ratify the Convention as soon as it has been approvedby Parliament, and Japan has promised to ratify it with as little delay as possible after its rati-fication by the other Powers.     A  certain number of States, such as Denmark, India, Sweden, and Norway ,make their ratifi-cation conditional on that of all the Signatory Powers, whereas Roumania, Luxemburg, Colombia, Uruguay, and Persia declare their willingness to adhere to the Convention.     It  will be seen  from this statement that the principal  Powers which have  replied to the enquiry make their  ratification depend on that of the other principal  Signatory  Powers.  This reservation would seem to refer especially to the United States of America, which are signatory to the Convention and which had not, up to the present, replied to the invitation addressed to them.     In addition, the Secretary-General sent two letters on February 17th, 1921, and on March 6th, 1922, to certain States Members of the League, represented at the Washington Conference   China,  British Empire,  France, Italy and Japan   asking them to take steps in the matter at Washington.  Three of these Governments, the British Empire, France and Japan, informed theStates which have replied lo the letter of March 8th: Belgium Brazil Chile China Czechoslovalda DenmarkI FinlandFranceGreeceGuatemalaHaitiIndiaItalyJapanLiberiaNetherlandsNew ZealandPolandRoumaniaStates which have replied to the letter of November 21st, and to the reminders:CanadaEsihoniaLithuaniaLuxemburgMexicoMonacoSalvadorSiamSpainSwedenSwitzerlandVenezuelaNorwayPanamaSouth Africa
  Secretariat that no opportunity had occurred at Washington for an official discussion of the qucs-  tion of the ratification of the Convention.   No progress was therefore made in this matter at the  Washington Conference.      The Commission at its Fourth Session had, moreover, adopted the following  Resolutions:              (a)  The Commission is of the opinion that the Convention of St.-Germain concerning          the Traffic in Arms,  which is of such importance to the peace of the world, remains and          will remain a dead  letter  unless and  until the Powers  signatory to the Convention,          whether  Members of the League or not, including the United States of America, see their          way to ratify it.              (b)  The Commission is of opinion that the  Council of the League of Nations should          be asked to communicate with the Members of the League of Nations which have not          ratified the St. Germain Convention urging them to  make the necessary preparations          for the ratification of the Convention in order that formal ratifications can be deposited          as soon as all of the principal Signatory Powers are ready to deposit their ratifications.              (c)  The Commission decided that the substance of the Secretariats Memorandum          on the Convention of St. Germain should be published.     The Council,  on the basis of the above decisions, adopted  on  July  20th last the following Resolution:               &quot;The Council would once more urge upon the  Members of the League of Nations          the importance, for the cause of universal peace, of the Convention of St. Germain.  It          urgently requests all the Members of the League who have not yet ratified the Convention          of St. Germain to make all the necessary preparations for the ratification of the Conven-          tion in order that the formal ratification can be deposited as soon as the principal Signa-          tory Powers, including the  United States of America, are ready to deposit theirs.&quot;     In pursuance of this  resolution of the  Council,  the Secretary-General  addressed  another letter to the States which had not ratified the Convention,  drawing their attention to the following points:              (1) The importance of the international control of the traffic in arms is heightened         by a study of the various aspects presented by  the problem of disarmament as defined         in various resolutions of the Assembly.             For instance, in connection with the surplus stocks of war material, the destruction         of which was recommended by the Assembly, the  Permanent Advisory Committee         expressed the opinion that:                   &quot;In fact, it is not the existence of &apos;surplus&apos;  stocks of munitions in the control             of a  competent Government,  even  if such stocks did exist, which would be open to             objection, but the  fact that they may be distributed all over the world  to persons             and  States which are not fitted to  possess them.                  &quot;This is one more urgent reason for the ratification of the Arms Traffic Conven-             tion,  part of which was drawn up in the first place to deal with this very  question.&quot;             (2) In considering another aspect of disarmament, namely, the question  of the pri-         vate manufacture of arms, which is mentioned in Article 8 of the Covenant, the Temporary         Mixed Commission reached  a similar conclusion, for, in February 1922, it expressed the         opinion that the best method of gaining control  of this manufacture appeared to be the         ratification of the Convention on the Traffic in Arms.             (3) At its fourth session, the Commission recognised the  difficulties which might         be entailed, for certain Powers which produce arms and munitions, by the ratification         of a Convention which imposes on the arms traffic and industry restrictions indispensable         to any form of control, but at the same time tends to modify the general economy of         production and exchange to the advantage of producing countries which have not ratified.             (4) Such considerations, though legitimate,  should not,  in the opinion of the Com-         mission, be allowed to  postpone indefinitely the application of a Convention likely to         produce such valuable results.  Accordingly, the Commission suggested that the Council         should adopt the resolution quoted above,  the effect of which would be to obviate any         delay in the application of the Convention as soon as it was certain that all the necessary         ratifications could be obtained.    Since this communication was despatched by the Secretary-General, a note, dated July 28th,has been received from the  Department of State of the United States Government:              &quot;The  communication which  the  Secretary-General  of the  League  of Nations         addressed to the Secretary of State of the United States of America on November 21st,         1921, has  had careful consideration.            &quot;In that communication the Secretary-General was so good as to bring to the know- ,        ledge of the Secretary of State a resolution adopted on October 1st, 1921, by the Assembly &apos;        of the League of Nations,  suggesting that the importance of ratifying the Arms Traffic        Convention of St.  Germain  should be strongly impressed on all the States signatories        thereto, whether Members of the League of Nations  or not, as well as the decision of the        Council of the League that the Assembly&apos;s resolution should be brought to the notice of        all States  which had  not notified the League of their intentions on the subject.&quot;
CONCLUSION.    Such, summarised as faithfully and briefly as possible, is the work of the Temporary mixed commission for the Reduction of Armaments since the second Assembly.    As stated by M. Viviani, its Chairman, at the opening of the 4th session of the TemporaryMixed Commission: &quot;the duties  with  which we have been entrusted by the Council are singu-larly important and complex.  They are important in view of the  fact that we have to  dealwith disarmament and that we are not free to handle the question of disarmament as we please,since we are the slaves of facts, the prisoners of circumstances and events.&quot;    The object to be aimed at is, perhaps, not so much theimmediate framing of hasty resolutions which  might  clash with, and be  contradicted  by,  the facts-as  the pursuit, with faith andperseverance,  of  the  study of one of the most difficult problems with which humanity has ever been faced. This is the faith with which the members of the Temporary Mixed Commission areinspired.    Should humanity deliberately enter to-morrow on the true path of peace, the general lines ofa plan which would lead the nations simultaneously to reduce their armaments could, not  fail to take definite shape in their minds and under their pens on the basis of the preliminary investi-gations which have already been carried out.    So far, the members are  not discouraged,  since again to quote M. Viviani &quot;in the past,humanity achieved nothing without  toil and time, and, as we are but men, we  are  heirs  of thosewho left us such a heritage of woe.&quot;             &quot;In reply to the inquiry made by the Secretary-General in pursuance of this action,         whether the Government of the United States of America is prepared to ratify the Con-         vention of St. Germain, the Secretary of State begs to state that the terms of the proposed         Convention have been carefully examined and that, while the Government of the United         States is in cordial sympathy with efforts to  restrict traffic in arms and munitions of         war, it finds itself unable to approve the provisions of the  Convention and to give any         assurance of its ratification.             &quot;The Secretary of State also desires to call attention to  the fact  that the Govern-         ment of the United States is desirous to co-operate for the purpose of suitably controlling         traffic in arms and munitions, and to this end the Congress of the United States has already         enacted legislation providing that, &apos; whenever  the President finds that in any  American         country, or in any country in which the United States exercises extra-territorial jurisdic-         tion,  conditions of domestic violence exist, which  are or may be promoted by the  use         of arms or munitions of war procured from the United States and makes proclamation         thereof, it shall thereafter be unlawful to export, except under such limitations and excep-         tions  as  the President prescribes, any arms or munitions of war from any place in  the         United States to such country until otherwise ordered by the President  or by Congress.&apos; &quot;    In view of this situation, the Temporary Mixed Commission, on September ist, 1922, adopted the following resolution:-            &quot;The Commission takes note of the communication of  the Department of State         stating that the Government of the United States is not able to ratify the Convention         of St.-Germain.   The Sub-Commission considers that this constitutes a fait nouveau. The         Commission is of opinion that the question of a Convention  on Arms Traffic must be re-         examined in its entirety in the light of the existing situation and with a view  to finding         the basis of a possible collaboration with the United  States.&quot;    The communication from the Government of the  United States has cleared the  situation.It is now apparent that the Convention of St. Germain in its present  form cannot be ratified  byall of the Principal Powers.  The new examination of the question in  its entirety called for by theresolution of the Temporary Mixed Commission will now be undertaken without delay, and must include a study of the changes which have occurred since the Convention of St. Germain was drawnup three years ago and since Sir Cecil Hurst drew up his report for the First Assembly.    If a basis for collaboration  can be found,  it will then remain for the Temporary mixed commission, with the approval of  the Council, to take steps which may lead to the drawing upof a new Convention or to the necessary modifications in the present Convention.

It will, however, result ina proposal  for a reduction of military expenditure.   Moreover,  the military expenditure of Sweden has  been verylargely  reduced.    This  expenditureamounted in T92ito 229,738,000 cr. ;itwas  estimated at  165,164,700 in  thebudget for 1922,  while the  budget atpresent before the Rikstag -  which only includes  expenditure for the first six months of 1923   allows 73,285,000crowns for this purpose.Switzerland.      i8th/w/y, 1922.

ANNEX IISTATEMENTS BY VARIOUS COUNTRIES ON THE CONSIDERATIONS RELATIVE TO    THE REQUIREMENTS  OF THEIR NATIONAL SAFETY, INTERNATIONAL OBLI-    GATIONS,  GEOGRAPHICAL  SITUATION  AND  SPECIAL CONDITIONS.1REPLY OF SOUTH africa                                                           CAPE TOWN, April 20th, 1921.Sir,    I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 8th, No. 21 /31 jzy, conveyingthe recommendation of the Assembly of the League of Nations that Governments should under-take, for the years 1922-23 and 1923-24, not to exceed the sum total of expenditure on the military,naval and air services provided for in the Budget for 1921-22.    While my Government is in cordial agreement with the aim of the Assembly, in thus makinga practical suggestion  to  carry  out  Article 8 of  the Covenant, they desire me to notify theCouncil of the League, in terms of the second reservation contained in your letter, of the following &quot;exceptional conditions&quot; which make it at present uncertain to what extent they will be able toadopt the recommendations in the immediate future:    1. The Union has never possessed a standing naval, military or air force. It has  not yet had time to develop its citizen force, the organisation devised for that purpose by the Union parliament in 1912 having never been brought into effective being owing to the interruption caused by theGreat War and a period of total inactivity  since the cessation of that war.    2. Before the Great War:             (a). The Imperial  Government maintained considerable forces stationed in the Union         for defence purposes.             (6)  There was no Air Force, Imperial or Union, in South Africa.             (c)  The Imperial  and not the  Union Government assumed responsibility for naval         defence of South African ports, waters and trade sea-routes.    3. The circumstances of the present day are that the Imperial Government has withdrawnpractically the whole of the Regular Garrison stationed in the Union before the War,  and it islikely that the Union will have to assume  the military obligations which before the Great war were assumed by the Imperial Government for purposes of local defence. The Union&apos;s share inthe Naval Defence of South Africa has also still to be determined in consultation with the ImperialGovernment.  These matters will be discussed  at a Conference which it is  proposed to hold inLondon at an early date; and  any declarations as to  the expenditure of the Union  on  military,naval and air defence in the immediate future would therefore be premature at present.     Finally, I desire to emphasise, for the consideration of the Council, &quot;the geographical situationand circumstances&quot; generally of the Union:     1.  The territory of the Union covers 473,000 square miles and contains a native population in the process of emerging from barbarism, which outnumbers the European population by 4 to 1.     2.  There are, moreover, in South Africa territories surrounding the Union but within theUnion&apos;s economic and  political sphere, wherein the  native population outnumbers the european population in far greater proportion.  Seeing that the Union is far and away the strongest civilised     In a letter dated June 7th, 1922, the Government of South Africa sent a statement regarding the military and police forces considered indispensable by the Union of South Africa for the preservation of domestic  order and theexpenditure entailed thereby. This statement provides full information of a numerical order.  Further, in the  courseof correspondence with regard to the limitation  of military expenditure, the Government of South Africa wrote theabove letter, dated April 20th, ig2r, containing  useful data on the considerations of national safety, international obli-gations, geographical situation and  special conditions which determine its policy with regard to armaments. This letter was duly communicated at the time to the various bodies concerned.
State in Central and Southern Africa, the peaceful and orderly development of other States and territories, and the welfare and good government of the indigenous native races of Africa and the african Continent in the Southern Hemisphere, are matters of  vital concern to the Union.    3. Only recently has the Union acquired  international status, with its concomitant obliga-tions in the way of national defence, and while other States have for years past made adequate provision for this purpose, the Union has had as yet no opportunity to lay down a basis for futureguidance.    Besides, by accepting the Mandate for South-West African Territory, she has not only largely increased her seaboard, but has rendered herself liable for the peace, order and defence of a largeterritory, containing large numbers of natives, hardly developed from the stage of barbarism.    Owing to the exceptional conditions mentioned in the first part of this memorandum, and the geographical situation and circumstances  enumerated herein, the Union Government, while theyare in general agreement with the policy of the League of Nations, do not feel at present justifiedin giving the definite assurances which the recommendation of  the Assembly suggests.    It is needless to add that the military and naval organisation contemplated for the Union hasreference entirely to the defence of South Africa and the maintenance of internal order and peace,and would  be  useless from the point of view of foreign aggression or operations to be conductedoutside of South Africa. It is therefore in complete conformity with the peaceful ideals which theLeague has at heart.    t have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant,The Secretary-General,        League of Nations,             Geneva.

  (Translation.)MINISTRY OF WAR.                                            TIRANA, May 23rd, 1922.    Reply to the letter No. 663, dated April 27th, 1922, forwarded by the Ministry of ForeignAffairs.    We have the  honour to reply  to the questions asked by the Secretariat of the League ofNations.    From 1913 till 1920 Albania was occupied by various foreign Powers and did not, in conse-quence, possess any military organisation.    The work of organisation was  commenced in 1921 and is still proceeding.    The Albanian  State never possessed any naval organisation and has none at the present time.    The acquisition of some aeroplanes is contemplated but they have not  yet been purchased.    The Albanian State possesses  armed forces of soldiers and gendarmerie numbering 10,772men;  their function is to preserve peace in the interior and to defend the frontiers,  which havean extent of 700 kilometres.  The Albanian Government is contemplating an increase of this force,with a view to facilitating the attainment of the objects mentioned above, without adding toits expenditure.    The Albanian people  have been for long periods without any government; they have thusbeen compelled, for their own preservation, to live perpetually under arms.  Moreover, the events of the last ten years since the Balkan  War, and the various policies pursued, had aggravatedthe situation.  Many Albanians fled to the mountains and adopted the manner of life of highlandpeoples.  The result is that the administration, which has been established  on  the model of moderngovernments, is in need of a well-organised, well-disciplined and adequate military force; hence the necessity of increasing the army and in particular of expanding the regular troops -  whichhave also to perform the duties of gendarmerie -  up to a total of 12,000 of all ranks. Nevertheless,once normal conditions are  restored, this force  will be reduced, and will  be organised on the &quot;Swiss Militia&quot; system.  This force  has not yet been fully equipped with modern  armament.    As regards aeroplanes, as-we have just observed, we do not possess  any at present, but theAlbanian Government desires to possess  a small squadron, which would also be available for other public services, e.g., for the Postal  Service.    The average budget for the maintenance of this force does not exceed 10,000,000 gold francs,and an additional  10 millions is all  that will be  needed to complete  its armament in accordancewith modern requirements.    The number of officers in the gendarmerie is 367, Cavalry  N.C.O.S 8, gendarmes  2,098 andmounted gendarmes 79.    The military forces comprise the following units:         3  regiments of infantry;        3  battalions of rifles;        3  heavy machine-gun companies, with four machine-guns per  company.        3  4-gun mountain  batteries armed with guns  of 75 calibre;        1  howitzer battalion of artillery,  consisting of two 4-gun  batteries;         1  company of  engineers, consisting of  two sections (engineering and bridging);        1  communication company, equipped  with heliostats and telephones;        4  aeroplanes, of which two are fighting machines and two are used  for communications.    The military organisation is based on the same principles  as in all other countries; everyAlbanian citizen without exception is obliged to perform military service. The articles of the law governing the Army organisation are based on, and are in exact conformity with, Article 4, viz:    1. Every Albanian  is  obliged to perform military service by virtue of this law.    2. Liability to military service commences  in  all cases in the month of January after theman&apos;s 18th birthday.    3. Military service  is divided into  two periods:             (a) Active Service.             (b) Reserve  Service.    The period of active service in all branches of the  army extends up to  the age of 50 years.    4. According to the requirements of the country, a portion or the whole of the young menwho have reached  the age of 19 will be  called to the Colours by  the  War Minister each January.

GENEVA, July ioth, 1922.            No. 290.Sir,    In reply to the circular letter,  C. L. 54.1922. IX, dated June 12th last and signed by the Presi-dent of the Council of the League, which you were good enough to send to my Government, I aminstructed to request you to bring to the notice of those concerned the reasons for which the federal government has not thought fit to submit to the Temporary Mixed Commission for the Reductionof Armaments a statement such as is asked for in the above-mentioned circular letter.    The military, naval, and air forces of the Republic of Austria are the subject of special clauses in the Treaty of St. Germain.  They could not be included in the draft treaty which the Corn-mission is considering with a view to reducing the armaments of States which possess freedomof action as regards their military and other forces. In these circumstances, the Federal Govern-ment considers  that there is no occasion to prepare a statement on the subject of disarmamentin relation to the geographical situation and special conditions of Austria.

IX) the Acting President of the Council of theLeague of Nations requested me to furnish a statement on the considerations which the BelgianGovernment feels bound to submit, with regard to the requirements of its international obligations,its geographical  situation, its special circumstances and with regard to the police and militaryforces indispensable for the internal security of the country.    I have the honour to  transmit you herewith the statement  in question.                               I have the honour to be, etc.                                                                 (Signed) Henri JASPAR..The Hon. Sir ERIC DRUMMOND,         Secretary-General of the League  of Nations,                    Geneva.
                                       STATEMENT.   .                                             I.    The Treaties of April 19th, 1839, imposed upon Belgium a regime of guaranteed neutralityto which the Treaty of Versailles put an end.  Relying on the engagements undertaken by the signatory Powers of the Treaties of 1839, the Belgian Government formerly considered that itwas only bound to develop the military forces of the country to a very limited extent. The new international status of Belgium, by freeing her sovereignty from every restriction and by renderingher mistress of her destiny, has done away with the protection afforded by her guarantors.  Shetherefore has to protect herself against the dangers which may menace her frontiers: and concern for her security makes it her duty to maintain the military forces for which she has made provision in the curr nt year.  It must not be forgotten that she was the first to experience the shock andinvasion of the German armies, that almost the whole of her territory was invaded and held toransom, and that she must, in consequence, take the necessary precautions to avoid a repetition of such a calamity. The sincere desire of the Belgian people to live in peace and to reduce theirarmaments to a minimum cannot be questioned.  The letter of April 21st, 1921, in which theBelgian Government undertook to conform to the recommendation of the Assembly of the Leagueof Nations with regard to the reduction of military expenditure, is a definite proof of this.  Butthe accumulation of suffering, of ruin and of affliction in Belgium, during the course of the warbrought on by the bellicose spirit of Germany, and  the systematic  destruction  of her industrialwealth carried out during the occupation, keep  alive in the country an unconquerable  mistrustof the sentiments of the German people.  This mistrust is only two well justified by the strugglewhich is, at this very moment, proceeding in the  German Republic, between the forces favourable to peace and the forces of Pangermanism.    The issue of this  struggle cannot be foreseen, but so long as the possibility of conflict exists,so long as there exist no guarantees of peace  and  real tranquillity for Germany&apos;s  neighbours,these latter would be guilty of criminal folly towards themselves and towards those peoples whoare exposed  to the same dangers as themselves, if they did not maintain an army of  defence,: ufficient   though reduced to a minimum.  Belgium has attempted to reconcile her international obligations with her desire to conform to a general limitation of armaments, and her future m litarysystem has been defined within the limits of Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of  Nations,which, indeed, only requires that  armaments shall be reduced to .the lowest point consistent with national safety  and taking account of geographical situation.                                            II.    As regards  the geographical  situation  and special circumstances  of the country, which arenext to be taken into  consideration, attention must be drawn to the fact that the dangers of inva-sion for Belgium are increased to  a remarkable extent  by the length of the exposed frontier andthe narrowness of her territory.  The barrier of the Rhine, partly re-established between Franceand Germany, the fortifications which protect  the new frontier between these two countries,the dense railway system on the  right bank of the  Rhine  north of Cologne, the  absence of any important geographical obstacles between the Rhine and the Flanders coast, and the developmentof the Belgian system  of roads, would most probably, in the event of a new conflict, render Belgiumthe principal line of advance for the German armies. A country so narrow as ours must seek toprotect itself against  the unavoidable disadvantages of its geographical situation, which exposeits plains to the danger of being overrun by enemy armies.    Situated as she  is at the meeting-place  of two  races and two different civilisations, at thejunction of many economic and commercial currents, Belgium has been the battlefield of western europe ever since the formation  of the great Monarchies.     Recent experiences have proved that these conditions have not changed;  she is thereforeforced to maintain an army sufficiently strong to  counterbalance to a certain extent the disad-vantages of her geographical situation.     The Bill which the Government is shortly proposing to  introduce is based on universal serviceand a ten months&apos; period of service for the infantry. This will allow the organisation, on a peacefooting, of nine divisions, and the creation, in case of  mobilisation, of reserve divisions, varyingin number, according to the danger  menacing our  security.                                            III.     Finally, as regards the military and police forces  necessary for the security of the country,it should be pointed  out that the gendarmerie has generally  been sufficient to deal with passingdisturbances and to maintain order.  Belgium, like all other countries, is  suffering from a socialcrisis  out of which internal  disorders may arise; but the moderate and commonsense  characterof the Belgian people makes disorders of this kind very unlikely.     The part that the  Belgian army may be called upon to play  in maintaining internal ordercannot, therefore, be regarded as one of the chief points for consideration in fixing  its  strength.
5REPLY OF  BULGARIA  [Translation.]                                                 SOFIA, June 16th, 1922.Your Excellency,    In reply to your letter of April 13th, I have the honour to lay before Your Excellency thefollowing statement:     Bulgaria signed the Treaty of Peace with the sincere intention of loyally carrying out thewhole of its clauses. In spite of the economic and social reasons which the Bulgarian Delegationurged on the Peace Conference in support  of its  request  that certain of the military clausesshould be modified, the Conference,  while recognising the soundness and accuracy of these argu-ments, felt compelled nevertheless to maintain its original proposal, and to refuse to make  any alteration in the clauses in question. Bulgaria has therefore endeavoured, during more than threeyears, to carry out the conditions which were imposed upon her.    The internal  situation  of  Bulgaria presents  great difficulties as a result of the reductioneffected in her army.  In spite of financial sacrifices beyond her strength, in spite of the energeticpropaganda which has been carried on, and in spite of the efforts made to attract a large numberof volunteers into the Army,  she  is to-day unable to take effective measures against  the ever-increasing brigandage and the disorders of all kinds in the interior of the country, which preventher from regaining her  pre-war economic position.  It  is obvious that so limited a number ofsoldiers cannot be relied upon  for the defence of the frontiers of the Kingdom, and for the main-tenance of order and of the authority of the administration.  The Government is therefore facedwith the greatest difficulties in ensuring order and safety in  the country.    The present strength of the Bulgarian armed forces is  as follows: 	Regular Army		Frontier Guards		Gendarmerie		Under the terms of the Treaty	Actual strength.	Under the terms of the Treaty	Actual strength	Under the terms of the Treaty	Actual strengthOfficers . . Soldiers . .	1,000 20,000	. 930 6,475	150 3,000	149 280	500 10,000	432 3.402 that is to say, a total of 10,157 soldiers and 1,511 officers instead of the 33,000 soldiers and 1,650 officers  provided for in the Treaty of Neuilly.     In  view of  the unsettled situation in the interior of the country  after the three successive wars which Bulgaria has been compelled to wage since 1912; in yiew of the daily increasing bri- gandage which  extends even to the most populous districts and threatens  the main routes of communication;  in view of the  heavy financial obligations assumed by Bulgaria, and  in  view of the fact that the frontiers are largely unprotected against smuggling, it is obvious that there is a danger that the position of the country, which is already very insecure, may be irretrievably compromised.     Bulgaria is  fully conscious  of the obligations incumbent on  her, viz:              1.  To re-establish  her internal situation;             2.  To organise all the productive forces of the country so that economic life may         be restored; to establish normal conditions of life as far as possible, and to begin to fulfil         her obligations towards her former enemies;             3.  To protect her  frontiers  against inroads by brigands and smugglers, and against         contingencies  of all kinds.    Unfortunately, it must be admitted that at present none of the conditions essential to anywell-ordered country exist in Bulgaria.  The abolition of the old military  organisation and thesubstitution for  it of a  voluntary army renders the organisation and existence of a trustworthyand solid army problematical, if not impossible.                                               $    As  experience has  shown in other countries,  the system of  voluntary recruiting does not present  any difficulty in the case of the  great industrial States of  Europe.  The large numb  ersof poor and unemployed, together with  the  considerable financial resources at the disposal  ofthose States, greatly  facilitate the recruiting of an. army  of volunteers. In  Bulgaria, ho we ver,this system of recruiting has met with insurmountable  difficulties in consequence of t he specialeconomic and social conditions of our country.
     The immense majority of the Bulgarian people are agriculturists.  The peasants constitute80 per cent, of the total population.  Every peasant owns a small piece of land to which he is greattyattached.  He feels a religious respect for his country and  his family,and he objects to any occu-pation which would keep him for a prolonged period  away from the home where he was born.It is no exaggeration to attribute to this special trait  of the Bulgarian, character the disastrousresult of the recent wars. During a period of many years,Bulgarian Governments had been com-pelled,in consideration of these conditions, gradually to reduce the period of compulsory militaryservice to 15 months -  a unique occurrence among Continental States.  For example, the periodof service for non-commissioned officers of the army was originally fixed at a minimum of threeyears.  As a sufficient number of candidates did not  come forward to enrol themselves in theArmy, the period of service was reduced to  one year, while other advantages and privileges were granted  to soldiers.     In these circumstances it will be understood that the volunteers who come forward to-day for enlistment  in the new army belong mostly to a class which could not earn a living in other employments.  They are persons of very  doubtful moral value, upon whom the State could notrely in a crisis. In view, moreover, of the insufficient number of volunteers, it is impossible for theGovernment to make any selection among those who offer themselves for enlistment in the Army;on the contrary, it is compelled by the circumstances to accept gladly  any candidates.     The system of military service as provided for in the Peace Treaty, constitutes a great dangerfor the country,  and this fact cannot be too strongly  emphasised.  A wave of communist ideas,which found in the difficult economic  situation  favourable  conditions for development,  is atpresent  sweeping over  Bulgaria   Bolshevik propaganda  finds  favour  and encouragementowing to the nearness of Russia, and  constitutes to-day a most pressing  danger.  Bulgarianextremists are  sparing no efforts to impose upon  the country the dictatorship of the proletariat.Their attempts to win the army to their side were in vain.  They are now determined to enter the army in large numbers by taking advantage of the system of voluntary enlistment.  The control of  the State,  however  vigilant it may  be, is powerless to ward off this danger.  In these circumstances  there can be no doubt  that  the Bulgarian communists will gradually but surely work their way into the army and will become its only organised force  and the masters of the situation.     The Bulgarian Government  has adopted energetic measures against the communists in the country.  The foreign representatives in Bulgaria  can give evidence on this point.   Thanks to her army, which was recruited under the compulsory system, Bulgaria was able to keep under the extremist  elements, which  became active on several  occasions.  At  those critical moments the army did its duty to the full, especially during the  general strike in 1919.  If it had not  been so, it is quite probable that the communists would have  succeeded in accomplishing their  aims by force.     To-day, on the other hand, when the old army has disappeared and has given place to  an army of volunteers,  the latter would undoubtedly, if an opportunity had arisen, have become the docile instrument of  the communist leaders.     A few examples will afford striking  proof of the  impossibility for Bulgaria of bringing her army up to strength under the voluntary system.     The Bulgarian police has  hitherto not been fully qualified for its  work,  and  is  not suc- ceeding in filling its  ranks  with capable  and thoroughly trustworthy men, in spite of the efforts which the Government  has devoted to its organisation.  Notwithstanding the very favourable terms offered, difficulties are encountered  in  recruiting,  and  the total  of 4,000 men which was contemplated  is far from being  reached.   How  much  greater will be the difficulties to be over- come in finding volunteers to the extent of 20,000 for the army and 13,000 for the gendarmerie and the frontier guards !     Apart from these difficulties in the recruiting of a  voluntary army, Bulgaria will soon be unable to find the money to pay this new army.  The maintenance of an army of 20,000 men and a gendarmerie of 13,000 involves at present the expenditure of the enormous sum of approximately 500 million levas for the pay of soldiers and officers alone.  Add to this amount  other expenses amounting to 400 million levas, and it will be seen that the army costsBulgaria more than 900 million levas   a burden which the budget of the State cannot bear indefinitely.  In view of the present situation of the country, these expenses greatly  exceed the resources of Bulgaria, which has never at any time in her existence spent more than 50 million levas on the maintenance of her armed forces.      In these circumstances, is it not justifiable to  declare categorically that the system of voluntary recruiting is quite unsuited to Bulgaria, and consequently that the maintenance of an army recruited under the compulsory system is an absolute necessity and  a conditio sine qua non  for  the very existence Of the country ?   With her new army Bulgaria runs the risk of falling a prey to internal conflicts which will certainly result in the  disappearance of the country as a free and sovereign State.      The Bulgarian Government, which is fully conscious of its responsibilities, will continue, as in the past and  with the same energy, to defend the independence of the country and to  maintain the authority of the administration.  It will, however, never cease openly to make  the  following)  declarations  - the truth of  which has been admitted  by the members of  the Inter-Allied  Commission and of the Military Control Commission, as well as by all foreigners who have visited  the country since the armistice:               1. The armed forces, as laid down in the Treaty of Neuilly, are insufficient;               2. The recruiting of the  Army  by means of the voluntary system is a crushing-           economic burden on the country, and prevents it from recovering and from meeting the
        financial obligations imposed on it by the Treaty of Neuilly.  Moreover, with this method        of recruiting, Bulgaria cannot organise a well-disciplined army;             3. In spite of the active publicity campaign which has been carried out, and in spite        of all the efforts made to obtain a sufficient number of voluntary recruits for the army,        Bulgaria has at present only 10,000 men available.  The generous rates of pay offered,        which are immensely higher than the average of those paid to officials, and which impose        a heavy burden on the Budget   and all the privileges granted to volunteers (volunteers        receive, in addition  to pay, their food, quarters and clothing:  on completion  of their        terms of service  the State  guarantees them employment of some sort, a piece  of land,        pension, etc., and four months leave per year), and the propaganda which the deputies        themselves have carried out in the towns and country districts -  all these endeavours have        produced only trifling results.  The Bulgarian peasant declines to leave his land.    The Bulgarian Government is under no illusion as to the dangers to which it would be exposedin case of  a fresh outbreak of the extremists.  It therefore feels sure that  the League of  nations will not refuse to recognise the gravity of the  situation in which the country is placed.  It  isfirmly convinced that when the question has been  reconsidered,  Bulgaria will be authorised to recruit her armed forces by compulsory enlistment on a scale which could be strictly defined and could be far below that of the pre-war establishment.   In this way the Allied Powers would havea guarantee that the Bulgarian army would not be increased beyond  the indispensable minimum;on the other hand,Bulgaria would be enabled to organise an army  which, though small, would bedisciplined and reliable, and in which the authorities could always place confidence.    In view of these considerations, the Bulgarian Government ventures to submit, for the conside-ration of the Assembly, the following suggestions regarding the  numbers and organisation of itsarmy :    I.                Regular army,    30,000 men.                      Frontier guards,     5,000  B                      Gendarmerie,      10,000  *    The recruiting of the army,  the frontier guards and  the gendarmerie should be effected onthe system of compulsory military service, with a term of service of two to three years.  The annuallevy called to the colours should not exceed 8.000 to  10,000 men.    As regards the frontier guards, it is  particularly desirable that  they should be recruited underthe compulsory system.  In fact, recent experience has proved that the control of the frontiersat present exercised by the frontier guards is illusory.   This force is at present recruited from the poorest citizens, who, in many cases, accept the hardship and dangers of this employment withthe object of working in league with the smugglers.  Regular soldiers are really indispensable toenable us  to guard our extended frontiers in an effective manner, since they will always be inspired by a sense of patriotic duty, whereas mercenaries will never risk their lives to protect the integrity of our territory against the incursion of armed bands.    If Bulgaria is allowed to maintain a small regular  army, the present  situation in the Balkanswould be in  no way thereby modified in her favour.   How could this  small armed force constitute a danger to our neighbours, who are far stronger  than ourselves, particularly when it is rememberedthat modern conditions render any army powerless unless it has the support of highly developedwar industries ?    Another circumstance which should be taken into account in deciding on our system of recruit-ing is the fact that, under the voluntary system, the State budget has to support, as is  mentionedabove,  an additional burden  of 500  million leva.   If the  country  were relieved  of  thisexcessive expenditure, it would be able to carry  out  the financial  obligations imposed on it by theTreaty of  Neuilly.    II.  Another question which Bulgaria  cannot  too strongly urge upon the attention of theLeague of Nations is the present situation of the corps of officers. In  compliance with the military clauses of  the Peace  Treaty, the Government was obliged to discharge a great number of officersof the old  army.  Bulgaria was only authorised to retain her officers in a proportion of 1: 20 of the totalof her armed forces;  as this proportion was insufficient, it became necessary to fill a large numberof purely  military appointments  by civil employes who were entirely unfamiliar with  militaryaffairs and lacked the special knowledge required for their duties. These officials have,  to a largeextent, become the agents of extremist propaganda in the army and have materially assisted in undermining the  discipline and loyalty of all ranks.    The Bulgarian  Government  asks to be authorised to increase  the number of officers  to a proportion of 1 : 15  of the total  strength.    III. The Peace Treaty allows only one military school for the military education of the officersand N.C.O.S.  This school  is adequate for the training  of the officers, but it will be necessary toestablish a special school for N.C.O.S.                                                       ^    IV. Naval Clauses. The naval forces allowed to Bulgaria  by  the  Peace  Treaty  for thepolicing and inspection of fisheries consist, as a  maximum, of 4 torpedo boats and 6 motor-boats,with a displacement  of not more  than 100 tons each. These are insufficient to fulfil the require-ments of naval police; the vessels are of old design  and will be confined to their naval base for agreat  part of the year by  the storms which prevail in  the Black Sea.
- 4i -    It is desirable that this naval police force should be supplemented by some modern craft,much larger and better armed.  This fleet should include at least 8 destroyers of 800 tons eachand 8 torpedo boats of 250-300  tons each, organised in 4 divisions of 4 units each.    The naval police should be  placed under the command of the frontier guards.    The naval police on the Danube should consist of 3  flotillas of 4 motor-boats each, basedon Ruschuk, Lorn, and Widin.    V.  Air Clauses.  In conformity with the provisions of Articles 89 and 94 of the Treaty ofNeuilly, the Bulgarian Military Flying Corps was abolished.  It should, however, be recognisedthat, in addition to the purely military objects which a flying corps is chiefly designed  to fulfil,it may be very useful for maintaining order in the  interior  and particularly for the suppression of smuggling.  If Bulgaria had possessed a well-organised flying corps, it could have been success-fully used on several occasions during the last few years, e.g. :             1. In 1919, on the occasion of  the riots and  disturbances in  the interior.             2. In 1920, on the occasion of  the general  railway  strike.             3. Against brigandage  and smuggling on the  frontiers.             4. In May 1921,  on the occasion of the recent attempts to carry out smuggling by        aeroplanes.    Owing to the absence  of a military air force, Bulgaria  has suffered considerable loss, whichhas affected both the exchequer and individuals, during  the last few  years.    Having been admitted to  membership of the League  of Nations, Bulgaria has had to adhere to the International Air Convention.  She has in consequence  assumed certain obligations in regardto the maintenance of air police for  the great international air routes  which traverse her terri-tory (see Articles 204-212 of the Treaty  of Peace).    Bulgaria accordingly requests permission to organise three air squadrons based on Sofia, Varnaand Yamboli respectively, and also two naval air squadrons based on Varna and Burgas respectively;each squadron to consist of four machines.CONCLUSION.     In submitting these observations for the consideration^ the Assembly, the Bulgarian Govern-ment trusts that it will be recognised that the arguments  set forth above, upon which  it  hasbased  its request for a revision of the  military, naval and air clauses  of the Peace Treaty, are well founded.  These clauses should, it is submitted, be modified on the following general lines:             1. The recruiting of the Bulgarian armed forces should be  carried out under the         compulsory system; military service  should  not exceed two to three years.             2. The total number of soldiers allowed for the regular army should be increased         by 10,000; that  of the  frontier guards and gendarmerie by  5,000.             3. The proportion of officers should be raised to 1 : 15 of the total strength of the         armed forces.             4. Bulgaria  should  be allowed  to maintain a military school for the  training of         N.C.O.S.             5. The naval police should be increased to a minimum of 8 destroyers  of 800 tons         each,  8 torpedo  boats of 250-300 tons each,  and 12 motor-boats of 100 tons each.             6. Permission should be  given  for the formation of three squadrons  of aeroplanes         and two squadrons of seaplanes to  assist the naval police and the frontier guards.     It is hoped that these suggestions, which are of vital importance for the  Bulgarian  nation,will be favourably  considered by the League of Nations.  By allowing Bulgaria to maintain an armed force, however small, recruited under the compulsory system,  the  League  would enableour State  to exist under  normal  conditions,  and would ensure a peaceful and tranquil future forour people.

                             REPLY OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA[Translation.]  MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK REPUBLIC                               PRAGUE, July 3rd, 1922.         No. 97699/22-III/IYour Excellency,     In  reply  to  your C. L. 54, dated June 12th,  1922, 1 have the honour  to  bring  to yournotice the observations relating to the requirements of the  geographical situation and specialcircumstances of  the Czechoslovak  Republic which the Czechoslovak Government thinks well to submit in connection with the proposals to be made by the Temporary Mixed Commission,with a view to the drawing-up of a scheme for the reduction of national armaments.     For many reasons the Republic is placed in an  exceptionally difficult position as regards thedefence of its territory.  The chief of these reasons are as follows:      The frontiers of the Republic are very considerable in length (2,500 kilometres); the naturalobstacles protecting the frontiers are, generally speaking, of small value.     The vital centres of the country are all very close to the frontier, a fact which is inevitableowing to the shape of the territory.  In case of war, they would be exposed to immediate bom-bombardment from the air or even to gunfire.     Relations between the various parts of the Republic would become most uncertain in the eventof war,  as the lines of communication between  them are few and are veiy exposed by reason oftheir proximity to the frontiers.     It will be sufficient to point out, for instance, that the only satisfactory means of communi-cation between Bohemia and  Eastern Slovakia  is the  Prague-Ces-Trebova-Zilina Railway; only part of this line is double track; it runs only some 30 kilometres to the south of the Kladsko  Basin,and  skirts the frontier in the Tesin district.     This scanty  and  extremely vulnerable system of  communications renders  it particularly difficult for the Republic to concentrate its forces in any threatened region.     On the other hand, the neighbouring countries possess near the frontiers  of the Republic a highly developed system of communications, excellently adapted to offensive  operations.  A briefexamination of a railway map will make this plain to the least-experienced eye.     It need only be pointed out here that Bohemia is, as it were, hemmed in by a German double-track line with numerous branch lines running to the frontier, and  that the double-track fromBudapest  to Satoraljaujhely  and its branch lines running  to  the Slovakian frontier afford theMagyars opportunities of manoeuvring which the Republican armies are far from possessing.     In  order to realise clearly the serious disadvantages under which the  Republic labours inrespect of communications, it should also be borne in  mind that the vital centres  (industrial andother) of the Republic and the lines of communication being, as stated, very near the frontier, abombing squadron of enemy aeroplanes could carry out several flights in one day between its base and  the objectives assigned to it in Czechoslovak territory.  It would thus obtain results equalto, or at least approaching, those which might be expected of an aerial force two or three times as great in numbers or in transport capacity.     It is clear that any limitations which have been or may be imposed on the commercial aviationof the possible enemies of the Republic in regard to the radius of activity, transport capacity,etc.,of the machines are in part rendered illusory by the proximity of the important objectives whichthese machines would find in Czechoslovak territory.     It should also be borne in mind that the Republic might in certain conceivable circumstances be isolated, by reason  of its  geographical situation  (the uncertainty of communications with itsallies and the difficulties of providing all kinds of supplies).     The effect of all these circumstances, namely  -     The proximity to the frontier of all the vital points of the country;     The scanty and extremely vulnerable system of communications;                          V(     The great advantages which possible enemies of the Republic might derive from communi-        cations peculiarly adapted to offensive operations  is that  a surprise attack  could easily be made on the Republic and that such an attack, evenif carried out with small forces, might in a short space of time obtain considerable success, theconsequences of which might be irreparable.
                                 REPLY  OF  ESTHONIA  (TRANSLATION.)MINISTRY FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS                                -r         T I  6:N          OF ESTHONIA.    .                                     TALLINN,  July Sth, 1922.Your Excellency,    With reference to my letter of May 13TH last, No. 7304, I have the honour to bring to YourExcellency&apos;s notice the statement in question:    Geographically, Esthonia is situated on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, behind which liesRussia, with its special State organisation.  It is well known that Communism has  aggressivetendencies and employs all possible means to extend its influence over fresh territories.    Moreover, there exists in Esthonia a minority whose aims are opposed to those of the Estho-nian people, and who, should occasion arise, would find sympathisers abroad.    It is with these conditions  that Esthonia is obliged to reckon.  Esthonia has no aggressiveintentions, and the sole object of her military forces and her defensive preparations is thepreserv-ation of her independence and  freedom.    The organisation of her military forces is based on the principle of the maintenance of a standing skeleton army, in which all young and physically fit citizens receive military training.Taking into consideration the total population (1 ]/2 millions), the length of active military service(1 Y2 years)  and the fact that each year&apos;s contingent of young men numbers about 8,000, the perma-nent military  forces may be put at about 12,000 men.    To this figure must be  added the officers, military officials and non-commissioned officersserving beyond the compulsory  period, about 3,000 men in all.    The maintenance of the forces (military,  naval  and air),  the construction of the necessarybarracks and  the purchase of material for training and defence absorb about 30 per cent, of thetotal budget of the State, three-quarters of the total  expenditure being for ordinary expenditure.    This serious burden is imposed on  Esthonia by her geographical and political situation.    To ensure internal  order, Esthonia maintains at present about 1,500 police officers.1                               I have the honour to be,  etc.                                                                     (SIGNED)  Ant. PIIP.His Excellency Monsieur Paul HYMANS,     Acting President of the Council         of  the League of Nations.    The Republic has no other means Of countering this danger  than by maintaining a peacestrength sufficient to protect the frontiers at a momenfs notice.  The Republic could not evenfall back upon the expedient of evacuating the threatened area in order to concentrate its forces inthe rear, or at least it could do so only in certain special contingencies, on which it is obviouslyimpossible to base the whole system of national defence.    The problem of the organisation of national defence thus  presents extreme difficulties forthe Republic.  Doubtless other  countries experience similar difficulties, but it may confidentlybe asserted that in none of them  are these difficulties more acute.    It is only right that this peculiar position should be recognised when considering the extentof the military effort which the Republic has made, and may make in the future, in order to safe-guard its independence.    As regards the statement as  to  which part of the total military  forces of the  Republic isintended to meet the requirements of domestic order, it is impossible  to give such a definition,since it is actually on the external situation that these requirements depend.                                I have the honour to be, Sir, etc.,                                                       (SIGNED) Edouard BENES,                                            Prime  Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.To His Excellency the Acting President          of the  Council of the       League  of Nations, Geneva.
REPLY OF  FINLAND(Translation.)      ministry for  FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                                    HELSINGFORS, July 10th, 1922.      No. 8938Sir,     In a letter dated April 13th last, giving effect to the resolution of the Second Assembly ofthe League of Nations, you requested the Finnish Government to furnish a statement of the consi-derations it might wish  to urge in regard to the requirements of its national security, its interna-tional obligations, its geographical situation and its special circumstances; and, in particular, toindicate separately the police and military  forces which it considers indispensable for the preserv-ation of domestic order, and the expenditure thereby entailed.     In a letter dated June 12th last, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs furnished you with the dataasked for in a Questionnaire of November 29th, 1921.     This letter of June  12th informed you,  among other things, that in peace-time  the conscriptsof one class only are called up each year, and that the number of men called up for military service in 1921 was 30,904, of whom 17,281 were declared fit for active service.     The expenditure on national defence,  which  amounted to  35,197,110 Swiss francs  in 1921,was  13.8 % of the budget total; taxation for national defence came to TO.55 Swiss francs per headof the population, and that of all taxation was 76.35 Swiss francs per head.     Finland, with, a total area of 387,580 square kilometres, has a population of 3,335,237; herland frontiers are 3,040  kilometres long and her coastline 1,654 kilometres.     Before answering the question as to the number of fighting men and the quantity of munitionsrequired for the national security of Finland, we must first consider the extent of her frontiers and her exceedingly exposed situation, which, from the Middle Ages onwards,  has meant that Finlandhas often been a battlefield.  One of her neighbours, Russia, who is not a Member of the League ofNations, and whose  political organisation is founded on a  system fundamentally different fromthose of the Western Powers, possesses a considerable army a portion of which, acting in concert with the Baltic Fleet, might constitute a menace to Finland.     The figures quoted, and a cursory examination of the map, will suffice to show that the Fin-nish Army has been  reduced to the minimum required for the  defence of the country&apos;s frontiers.     The estimates for national defence  mentioned above are also quite low,  in view of  the  factthat it was not until 1918 that Finland began to organise her army and to construct her fortifications-tions, and particularly if one bears in mind the amount of material of all kinds which has had tobe imported for these purposes at most unfavourable rates of exchange.     With regard to  the strength of the armed forces required for the maintenance of internal order, I am informed by the competent authorities that, owing to the general political situation,they cannot give exact figures.  There are, however, no troops in Finland intended solely for policeduties.     I have, therefore, in  view of the above, the honour to express the firm conviction of the Govern-ment of the Finnish Republic  that, considering her situation  and general political conditions,Finland cannot at present reduce her defence forces without at once  endangering her own inde-pendence, and thereby the security of the Northern States.     I have the honour to be, etc.,                                                              (Signed)  Carl  ENCKELL.Sir Eric DRUMMOND,    Secretary-General of the League of Nations,             Geneva.
REPLY OF  FRANCE    Prance&apos;s armaments must meet at the same time the international obligations which arise from the application of the Treaties and the requirements of the security of the country, includingher colonies.The obligations arising out of the application of the Treaties are at present as follows:                                                Men.Occupation of the Rhine Provinces.....      92,000Maintenance of order in the Saar......       8,000Maintenance of order in Upper Silesia and at    Memel...............      10,000Occupation of Constantinople and the Straits.       8,000Mandates  for  Syria, the  Cameroons  and    Togoland..............      42,000Approximate total......    160,000    No other European Power has assumed such extensive international  obligations.  Francecontinues, however, with determination to fulfil her engagements towards her Allies, and it maybe said that through the position which she occupies on the Rhine, owing to the relative impor-tance of her military forces, she is bearing the heaviest burdens arising out  of the application ofthe Treaties in Western Europe.    At Constantinople she is assuring, on an equal footing with Great Britain and Italy, the maimtenance of the neutrality of the Straits.    In Asia, where she has  received a mandate for Syria, her forces have had to undergo severefighting, and there is no assurance that they will not again be involved in fighting if, in the near east, there is any prolonged delay in the establishment of peace conditions.    Similarly, in Africa, it is her duty to ensure the maintenance of order and peace in Togolandand the Cameroons.As regard her own security, France is obliged:    (1)  to protect her colonial empire;    (2)  to maintain internal order;    (3)  to assure the integrity of her national territory against an enemy from without.                       (1) Protection 0/  our  Colonial Empire.Our Colonies and Protectorates require for their occupation and, in some cases, pacification:                                               Men.Morocco................     85,000Algeria and Tunis............     75,000Other colonies..............     70,000                        Total   ......    230,000       In  Morocco, pacification is still far  from complete.  The  native population is still easily   incited  to rebellion, against  which we must uphold the Sultan&apos;s authority; the submission of^ certain  warlike tribes is both too recent and too uncertain to allow us at present to  contemplate   a too-hasty reduction of our forces.       In  the south of Algeria and Tunis, we are compelled to maintain large military  police forces   over a very wide frontier on account of the raids of desert robbers and the difficulties caused by   tribes which are frequently at war with one another.   Finally, France&apos;s own population is so small   that she is forced, even in peace-time, to prepare for the utilisation of her North African man power,   in case she should need to carry out a general mobilisation to repel an attack from without.
    The total of our requirements abroad, that is to say, the obligations arising from the applica-tion of the Treaties and from the occupation of the French colonial possessions, amounts therefore to. 160,000 plus 230,000 - 390,000 men.                             (2) Maintenance  of Internal Order.     Unlike  certain other Powers,  France has no units specially designed for the maintenanceof internal order.   Apart from the gendarmerie and the Republican Guard (23,000 men in all), thefirst employed for police duties and the enforcement of the law, the second restricted to ceremonialduties in Paris, the maintenance of internal  order,  which requires a minimum of 125,000 men,falls largely  upon the Army.                       (3) Defence of the Country against foreign Enemies.     In the present state of European politics,  the special position of France has so often beenmisunderstood that the French Government feels bound to define it clearly in this communication to the Commission.     France  has always desired peace.  She has proved this by silently bearing a terrible woundin her side for nearly fifty years.  She made the  most strenuous efforts to avoid the last war, and,in order to make it impossible, she even denuded her frontiers, and was the last to mobilise in aEurope seething with armed forces.  But, maimed, impoverished, in the presence of her numberlessgraves and her all-too-few cradles, five times invaded in a century and a quarter, France would fall short of her elementary duty of defence and her mission as a champion of order, peace and liberty,if she did not look toward her newly recovered frontier and take the necessary precautions againstthe possibility of another catastrophe.     France and almost the whole world wish for peace.  But in Germany, conquered only yester-day, is there really a  unanimous desire to preserve peace?  A terrible wave  of violence, whichbreaks out almost  daily and does not stop short of periodical murder, shows  that there are stilltoo few brave spirits in that country to stem  the tide of destruction.  And although the GermanGovernment, which the French Government  is seeking to help in  its  task,  condemns  suchmanifestations, there  is no indication, alas!  that it  has the necessary strength to check them.Germany, it seems, does not accept her defeat.  It is true that, with the exception of a  very fewwhom we should be happy to see becoming  more numerous, no German considers  the Treatyof Versailles as anything but  an intolerable  injustice,  a monstrous abuse of  force,  a peace  &quot;ofshame and violence,&quot; against which every means of resistance is justified. Thus the idea of revenge,systematically directed against France,  supported daily by a Press under the influence of the pan-Germans, and by militarist manifestations of every kind, which  no  authority has  yet beenstrong enough to suppress, is  making continuous progress among the mass of the people.     Moreover, the causes of  strife which might arise  in the near  or more-distant future  are many; it seems that  time, far from removing them, cannot but multiply  them.  They are, to mention  only the  chief of them:      From the political standpoint:              The  States  bordering on Germany, reeenthy created by the Peace Treaties, partly         at  her expense;             Upper Silesia, whose  frontiers, in the eyes of most Germans, are only provisionally         fixed;             The Saar, where we are still thirteen years from a plebiscite, which will  probably         be  disputed if it is favourable to us;             Austria,  whose attachment to the Empire is still preached and hoped for throughout         Germany;             Russia, which is  drawn towards Germany by a common hatred  of Poland, and the         colonisation of which is already being prepared by the great German  industrial interests         with their usual systematic thoroughness.     From the economic standpoint:              The extraordinary economic growth of Germany and the resultant need for expan-         sion, which were the fundamental reasons for the war of 1914.  The same causes seem         destined to produce in the future the  same effects as in the past, for not only has German         industry not  been destroyed, but it has developed considerably, and has to-day attained         a power such as it had never known before.     All these reasons  render a conflict still possible.  However firm  may be the desire of france to avoid  such a conflict, she would fail in her duty if she neglected to provide against it.                                            *     In view  of these possibilities, it is desirable to consider the military potentialities of Germany
EFFECTIVES.    The Treaty  of Versailles and  the agreements which followed  it  authorised Germany tomaintain:                     I. The Reichswehr.......    100,000 men                     2. The Schutzpolizei.......    150,000 men    If we can  regard the Schutzpolizei as consisting, at the lowest estimate, of 40,000 to 45,000police, it must also be  remembered that it includes 100,000 old soldiers  or non-commissioned officers, and 5,000 to  6,000 officers.    In spite of everything, Germany has eventually succeeded in  establishing the standing army of 200,000 men and more which she made such efforts to obtain upon the conclusion of the Treatyof Versailles.    The Reichswehr and the Schutzpolizei, though differently armed,  are recruited in the same way.  Under various.pretexts (suppression of disorder, combating fire or floods, etc.), the secondreceives military  training like the first, generally in accordance with the same regulations. Bothform  in reality reserves of officers  and non-commissioned officers, excellently  trained and welldisciplined, among whom all the traditions of the old German army are sedulously maintained.    These bodies can at any moment organise and officer considerable forces; no army in theworld has so huge and  perfect a framework for mass mobilisation.    The population of  Germany can very easily be mobilised.    At present there are 7,000,000 men who are trained, since they fought in the war. As thesemen reach the age limit, younger generations will take their place.  With this object in view, efforts are being made in Germany to encourage the gregarious instinct in the youth  of the countryand the innate love of military pageant; Government support is given  to athletic clubs, physical training is made  compulsory, and it is used for the purpose of inculcating into the  young menthe most indispensable  rudiments of military training.    This training would, it is true, need to be completed in case  of mobilisation, but to gain thetime needed Germany has succeeded in organising reserves of volunteers  who can be ready at very short notice.  These volunteers are:             1.  The members of the societies of old soldiers and of young men (Kyffhauserbund, &apos;         regimental unions, agricultural colonies, athletic clubs, etc.).             The &quot;Baltikum &quot; adventure, the mobilisation in March 1920 against the Communists         of the Ruhr, the levying of the Freikorps of Hosfer for the protection of the Germans         in Upper Silesia, show how easily and how quickly the  mobilisation of volunteer units         could be carried out.  After each of these operations, the procedure employed has been        improved.  The latest, that of Upper Silesia, has shown the Allied troops the progressive         but very rapid formation of a veritable army of 40,000 men, organised in divisions,        brigades and regiments, provided with artillery and aeroplanes, an army with a front        line and base organisation, the mobilisation and movements of which were systematically         effected.             2.   The  &quot;Technische  Nothilfe,&quot; which consists of  about 300,000 men,  a  civilian         organisation ready to provide all the technical troops  required by the army.                                        COMMAND.    The command of the army by the officers who have fought in the war is assured for the presentand for many years to come.   Frequent lectures given at the Reichswehrsministerium,  tacticalstudies of every kind, Kriegspiele carried on in which all the staffs take part, frequent examinationsorganised by the seven Wehrkreise (Reichswehr districts) and  numerous skeleton manoeuvres, allbear witness to the great intellectual activity which exists in all ranks of the military hierarchy.    The war academy for the instruction of &quot;staff officers has been abolished, but a similar schoolhas been formed  in each  of the military districts.  Furthermore, the recruitment of the officers for the&apos;future army is  very actively carried on by the universities, which are in close touch with theofficers&apos; organisations.                                        MATERIAL.    Although Germany is rich in men, the effectives which she can put in the field will depend, atleast for some years, on the extent to which she can arm them.1 The Kyffhauserbund comprises more than three million members, all ex-combatants.
    The activities of the Commissions of Control  have resulted in temporarily restricting  herpowers in this direction, but there can be no doubt that, as soon as these Commissions are reduced or withdrawn, it will be relatively easy to replenish the necessary stocks of material.    The war factories existing in Germany will not be the only ones contributing to this replenish-ment.   Experience has shown that certain peace-time industries can be adapted,  almost withoutmodifications, to the manufacture of war material; for example, 75 % of the explosives employedby the Germans during the last war came from their chemical factories.   Moreover, some of  theprincipal German firms have bought or created establishments in the neighbouring countries; theyare able, even now, to manufacture war material of every kind without infringing the Treaty ofVersailles.   Researches are being carried out in every branch of science with a view to  applyingthem to war; professorships,  laboratories and materials for experiment  have been retained orestablished, with a liberality out  of place in a nation which professes to be disarmed and whosefinances are in a precarious condition.    There  will  never be any lack of portable arms; they are too easy to conceal.  Moreover,  theReichsheer is richly  endowed with service material  in good condition,  which could be  used  forarming  the first units to be mobilised.    The provision of artillery for the larger units would present difficulties which, although serious,would not  appear to be insuperable.  There can be no doubt that the German command will endeavour  to conceal material from the investigations of the Commissions of Control, as, indeed,it  has been constantly trying to  do  since the Treaty came  into force, and to manufacture newmaterial as soon as the supervision is relaxed.   It will form depots in other countries, thanks to  the factories in the  possession of its trusts, and if the manufacture of war material is begun before  thegeneral  mobilisation, the  great power of  German industry will enable  it  to produce before  thebeginning of hostilities a large proportion of the indispensable material for a  considerable number oflarge units.    Finally,  as regards aviation  the army can always be supplied with some of the necessarymachines by the transformation of commercial or sporting aeroplanes into war machines; chasersand scouts will be constructed abroad, if the restrictions imposed on the German Air Force and  thecontrol exercised do not allow them to be constructed in Germany itself.                                             *                                          *      *                                      MOBILISATION.    It cannot be said that mobilisation would be impossible in Germany, should the occasion arise.Although, as the result of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is at present unable to place all  herforces in the field simultaneously, as in 1914, she could, if she desired war, mobilise by echelons.    Thanks to the system of &quot;multiplication of divisions,&quot; a very considerable number of divisionscould be mobilised in less than a month.  The other echelons would follow at intervals which wouldbe closer in proportion as the period of political tension had been deliberately prolonged.  More-over, it must be remembered that the Inter-Allied Commissions of Control will have disappeared.Mobilisation would be covered by the  &quot;Schutzpolizei,&quot; reinforced by volunteers.    Thus Germany has  the double advantage of greater industrial strength and a  populationone-third more numerous than France.   France, therefore, must safeguard her self by securingsuperiority in the matter of time.   A rapid deployment of her forces can alone allow her in case of attack to benefit by the real advantage which the Treaty of Versailles provides, in  preventingGermany from carrying out, as in 19.14, a simultaneous mobilisation of all her forces.    For this purpose   and all the new Technical Councils of the French Government are unani-mous on the point    it is necessary to  maintain in time of peace in  France and on the Rhinethirty-two  divisions with the corresponding auxiliary services (heavy artillery, aviation, liaisonand communication troops, service corps, etc.).  Of these thirty-two divisions,                six ( 92,000 men) should be on the Rhine and         twenty-six (335,000 men) should be on French soil.         Total:      427,000 men.                                                 .    By adding to the 335,000 men stationed in France:             Commitments abroad.........     160,000 men J     0Q0             Troops of occupation for the colonies .   .  .     230,000 men I J&quot; &apos;a total of 725,000 men would be reached.    The French Government, being anxious to impose as light a military service as possible onits population, and wishing to include in its calculations the troops returning from Silesia, and toreduce its military forces in the colonies to the strict minimum,  has fixed its total requirements at only*690,ooo men.    In  this way, the total forces necessary for French territory, which  should be 335,000 men,would be reduced to 300,000.  The  deficit would be made good by the 10,000 men to be  obtained
from Upper Silesia and by troops made available by reductions in the armies in the colonies, tobe effected at a future date which cannot yet be fixed.    The 690,000 men of the French army may be divided as follows:                 100,000 professional soldiers,                 375,000 conscripts,                 205,000 North African and colonial natives,                   10,000 foreigners           Total 690,000    Of this total:                 150,000 men will be stationed abroad in order to ensure the execution of the                              Treaties of Peace,                 205,000 will occupy the colonies,                 335,000 will remain in France           Total 690,000    The immediately available part of the French army in time of peace will be made up in practiceas follows:                 335,000 men in the interior;                  92,000 men on the Rhine.           Total 427,000    The Government considers that at this cost only can it attain a superiority in the matter oftime which will discourage any aggressive tendency.    This result, which will be  attained when the laws now being discussed by Parliament arepassed, constitutes a considerable step in the direction of disarmament as compared with the situa-tion in 1914.    In this connection, a comparative study of a few figures will be useful in order to show the effort made by France since the war to reduce her armaments within the limits compatible with therequirements of her security and her international obligations.    The French forces have varied as follows:                                                    Forces provided for in the Budget.                                  Troops.1Spring 1914.........     873,000 2       1921.........     717,000       1922.........     670,000       1922 (laws voted)  .  .  .     630,000 8    The number of officers in the regular army, which reached 47,000 at the end of 1919, had beenreduced to 38,700 on January 1st, 1922.  It will be further reduced this year by about 2,000.    The following table shows the number of units of infantry, cavalry and artillery at the begin-ning of 1914 and at present4:                                                   Infantry.      Cavalry.     Artillery.                                                   Companies.    Squadrons.    Batteries.               Beginning of 1914......      2,878       445       826               June 1922.........      2,486       350       880Except as regards artillery,  and in spite of  the commitments abroad of the French army, areduction of nearly 400 companies of infantry  and 100 squadrons of cavalry has therefore alreadybeen effected .    The total credits granted to the War  Department, both under the budget  and by the supple-mentary estimates, have been as follows:         In 1920     6   milliards            1921     5.4 milliards            1922     approximately 4.5 milliards,  showing a further reduction.Between 1920  and 1922, France has therefore reduced her military expenditure by 1.5 milliardfrancs, or by one quarter.    When the heavy international obligations imposed on France by the application of the Treatiesare considered, the full extent of such an effort in the way of reduction of armaments will be appre-ciated.    &apos; Forces provided for in the budget are the number which the financial law actually allows to be  maintained,and are inferior in number to the theoretical forces fixed by the military laws and which are the object of pages 47 and 48.    2 Including about 60,000 colonial troops stationed in the colonies proper, and figuring in the budget of the colo-nial administration.    3 Not including 54,800 men provided for by the budget of the Colonies.    4 Not including colonial troops stationed in the colonies proper, where there has  been little variation  in thenumber of units.
    The situation arising out of the war has imposed obligations on France with regard to  themaintenance of the political stability of Europe.,r&quot;l &quot;JThe presence of large French forces on the Rhine  not only applies pressure which  obligesGermany to respect the Treaties she has signed, but it  affords considerable moral support to theyoung nations of Central Europe which have arisen since the war, and it contributes largely to giving France the necessary authority for maintaining the principles of  order and justice, andfor securing their observance.    The military force of France is at present the essential factor of peace in Europe; France wouldbe glad  to reduce it, after the terrible sufferings she has  undergone; but she cannot be asked todo so as long as the germs of war, to which we have drawn attention, continue to exist.                                           lO                              REPLY OF GREAT BRITAINOFFICES OF THE CABINET,2, WHITEHALL GARDENS,                                      LONDON, July 24th, 1922.

The requirements in this respect are far greater than that of  any other nation, and are so well known that no useful purpose would be served by enumerating  them.    3.

For this  purpose two tables are  attached.   Table  A gives the  latest available figuresconnected with the British Empire, excluding  the Dominions which are Members of the League,and shows its area, population, man-power and military forces as anticipated for purposes of Esti-mates 1922-23.   Table B shows a comparison between  the  items given in  Table A  and similaritems for seven foreign countries, as nearly as can be ascertained.    2. From Table B  it will be observed that  the number of troops per square mile of territory in Great Britain is very much smaller than the number maintained per square mile by any other foreign country,  with the exception of the United States of America.   Also, it will be noticed thatthe British percentage of troops to man-power (considering white troops and white man-power only)is very much smaller than that of either Belgium, France or Russia, and is not considerably greater^than that of Italy or Japan.  And here it should be especially observed that nearly half of theBritish white troops are irregular troops, i.  e., Territorials, a condition which does not obtain inthe case of any of the above-mentioned nations, with the exception of Italy.1 Retained in the archives of the Secretariat.
     3- It will be seen in Table A that the total regular force  maintained  in  Great Britain isj in the neighbourhood of 111,000 men.   It must not be lost sight of, however, that this force, whose chief role is the supplying of drafts for the units overseas, is consequently very largely composed of recruits and young soldiers under training.  Consequently, the British forces cannot possibly exercise  the same immediate influence on European affairs as could a Continental army of equi- valent size.      4. Another  striking point emerges from a close examination of Table A.  If semi-permanent and temporary liabilities be eliminated from the portion headed  &quot;Imperial Troops&quot;, it will be found that His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain  some 170,800 native troops  among a total native popu- lation of 386,558,000 souls.   Taking the available man-power as being one-sixth of this  total, the remarkable figure of .27 per cent, is arrived at.   In other words, only  one native out of every 400 of military age is employed as a soldier, and only one native out of every 2,500 of the total native population.     5. Taking the case of  India only, it is found that the total armed force, British and Indian, which  is employed represents only .06 per cent, of the total native population, or less  than one soldier per 1,500 souls.

I tREPLY OF  GREECE12REPLY OF HAITI[Translation]      REPUBLIC OF HAITI.MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS.PORT-AU-PRINCE, May 17th, 1922. Your Excellency,     In your letter of April 13th last, you were good enough to draw the attention of this Depart- ment to the Resolution adopted by the second Assembly of the League of Nations relating to the preparation of a plan for the reduction of national armaments. You added that the Council con- sidered it desirable that, in carrying out this work, the Special Commission should, as far as possible, take into consideration the views of the Governments concerned; and you therefore requested me to furnish a statement of the considerations relating to the  requirements  of the national security of the Republic  of  Haiti, of  its geographical situation and of its special circumstances, and to indicate separately, as far as possible, the police and military forces regarded as indispensable for the  internal needs of the State and the expenditure entailed thereby.     I fully  appreciate the lofty aims by which this communication from the Council of the League of Nations is inspired, and have great pleasure in complying with so wise a request, particularly as I shall not need to detain the CounciFs attention for long.     The insular situation of the Republic of  Haiti, together with the special conditions resulting from  the Agreement concluded  on  September 15th, 1916, between her and the United States of America, have  indeed spared the Haitian  Government the need  of maintaining military forces in the strict sense of the term; nevertheless,  the exigencies of her internal security oblige it to maintain under arms a  force  of gendarmerie numbering 2,533 men,  for the maintenance  of whom   and  of the Coast Guards  - a sum of 801,063 dollars  is allocated each year in the Budget of the  Republic.     I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere good wishes for the complete success of the work of the Temporary Commission and have the honour to be is                          Your Excellency&apos;s, etc.His Excellency    The President of the Council of the        League of Nations,(Signed)  DEJEAN.vjenevc                                                                  GENEVA, June 13th, 1922.Sir,    In reply to your letter of April 13th, I can only refer you to &quot;my letter of April 10th.  Forthe reason stated therein, i.e., the continuance of the war with Turkey, it is impossible, untilpeace is finally concluded, for the  Greek Government to foresee the requirements of its national security, its other requirements and the police and military forces which it considers indispens-able for the preservation of order in  the country.

REPLY OF ITALYMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS                                  ROME, July 17th,  1922.           OF ITALY.Your Excellency,    With reference to your  letter No C. L. .54. 1922. IX,  which you were good enough to forward to me on June 12th, I beg to submit herewith a statement on the military and police forces which, in the estimate of the Royal Government, are indispensable for the safety of Italy,as well as on the expenses entailed by them.                          I have the honour, etc.                                                              (Signed) SCHANZER.His Excellency Monsieur QUINONES DE LEON,         President of the Council of the League of Nations.                 Geneva.(Translation.)                              - ,                                  STATEMENT.    Faithful to her traditions and inclinations,  Italy is loth to anticipate   even in the unfor-unfortunate event of a future war   the necessity of direct military intervention on her part.  Shecannot, however, be blind to the fact that the world is still in a state of unrest, and that conse-quently she might, in a possible future, be called upon to provide -  were it  only as a precau-tionary counter-measure - for the more adequate protection of her frontiers.    Until the beneficent activities of the League of Nations have taken more  definite shape, theItalian military organisation must reckon with the possibility of having to take precautions of a defensive nature.  For reasons inherent in the geographical and topographical peculiarities of herfrontier zones and owing to the  fact that certain vital centres of her national  life lie close to herfrontiers, Italy must at all costs provide for a prompt and effective defence of those frontiers.    Italy is also obliged to take into account the numerous forces and very considerable resources which she will have, to divert for the protection of her seaboard and her islands. These latter cannot in view of the obviously unfavourable conditions  of their geographical configuration, rely for protection on the Navy, which is already more than  sufirciently burdened by the duty of fighting the main body of possible enemy naval forces and of protecting sea communications which areof such essential importance for  Italy&apos; forced, as she is, to obtain her raw materials of every kindfrom overseas.    The requirements of the Colonies    which are  still far from able to provide for their  own defence or to afford any assistance to the mother-country   must also be taken into conside-ration, as,  in time of war, communication between Italy  and her Colonies cannot be established on a secure basis; the home country has therefore to  detach permanently considerable forces andmaterial to meet this need.    If the military situation of Italy as explained above is borne in mind, and if the technicalaspects of the Italian mobilisation are taken into consideration, it will be seen that Italy cannot but continue to maintain in time of peace a certain number of military units which, though their effective strength may be reduced, will nevertheless be such as to constitute a nucleus for the forma-tion of those large units, capable of rapid mobilisation, that are essential for her defence.    To confine our calculations  to the infantry, which, after all, constitutes the largest section ofthe Army, Italy has to maintain in time of peace at least some 50 brigades of infantry, each consist-ing of  two regiments,  and every regiment containing two full battalions and one skeleton battalion(this would reduce the Italian infantry, which, excluding Alpini and Bersaglieri, counted fully&quot;!288 battalions prior to 1914, to a strength of about 200 battalions).    Since each battalion would  in time of peace consist of about 500 men, the total strength tobe budgeted for under the heading of infantry,,  including the special corps  of Alpini and Bersa-gheri, amounts to at least 120,000 men.                                         ,   ,    Assuming the absolute necessity of assigning  this quota of men to the infantry, it  follows that the total forces  to  be  budgeted for cannot be  less  than 250,000 men.  This estimate will

The Japanese Government, in its desire to see the maintenance of universal peace and anincrease  in human prosperity, has taken as a standard for  the limitation of its armaments theminimum essential for purposes of national defence. Consequently it would  be able to reduce itsarmaments to a minimum, in strict conformity with the spirit of the Covenant of the League foNations, while taking into due account considerations of national security, international obliga-tions, its geographical situation and special circumstances. rtainly leave no liberal margin to make adequate provision for other arms and special branches  the service, particularly the artillery, the engineers and the Air Force, all of which underwent a j&quot; greater development during the late war than it was possible to foresee, and &quot;which the progress  technical knowledge will tend to increase still futther.   The above-mentioned  figure of  250,000  men  exactly  corresponds  with the present yield  one annual draft of recruits, including the small number of permanent  elements  which the italian Army possesses.  As it  is hoped that military training may be completed in one year,  it Hows that the exigencies of military defence can be reconciled with Italy&apos;s policy of reducing lie burden of military service to the bare minimum necessary for the physical and intellectual reparation of her citizens.   As regards the expenditure required  for such an army, it may be observed that the keep of ihe soldier costs very nearly 3,000 lire per annum, and that therefore the sum of about 750 million re would have to be allowed in the budget for the maintenance of these 250,000 men.   Since experience has shown that the grand total of a military budget amounts on an average 0 two and a-half times more than  the actual sum estimated for the forces themselves, Italy&apos;s lilitary budget will need to be somewhere  in the neighbourhood of 2 milliards. Naturally, however, uch figures do  not  include extraordinary expenditure incurred from time to time in renewing n a large scale the principal armaments and in fortifying the most important and exposed points f the frontier.  Experience also shows that the average sum required for extraordinary expenditure ay be estimated at something between a quarter and a fifth of the ordinary budget.  Thus, the expenditure required for the army, according to the very lowest computation, based entirely on he requirements for the training of her citizens, and without any other special increase in view[of war, may be fixed for Italy at from 2,400  to 2,500 millions.   The  special colonial troops which Italy has begun to organise in her Colonies are not yet a a position to ensure the defence of the latter. Nevertheless, in the foregoing estimate, the possi-responsibility of having to employ a larger number of home forces, to meet exceptional conditions obtainingin the Colonies has not been taken into consideration; and therefore any legitimate contribution forthis purpose would have to be deducted from the forces estimated as necessary to sustain the nucleusrequired  for mobilisation of the number of large units which has been shown to be indispensablefor the defence of the frontiers.    Italy possesses police and customs forces proportionate to her present requirements, consistingof rather more than 120,000 men, of whom about 60,000 are Carabinieri realises (RoyalCarabineers),30,000 men belonging to the Guardia di Publica Sicurezza (Public Safety Police)  and roughlythe same number belonging to the Guardia di Finanza (Customs Guards).    It should, however, be made clear that the Carabinieri realises, the Guardia de Publica Sicurezzaand the Guardia di Finanza cannot be regarded, except in a slight degree, as a force which could beemployed for combatant purposes,  any more  than other  reservists who can be re-called  to thecolours in case of need. These police corps, the first of which is the only one capable of beingpartly employed on police duty with the army when mobilised,  are not as a matter of fact consti-tuted into units possessing an organisation  which answers to tactical requirements; they are notarmed in the same way as the infantry troops, and they are not trained for combatant work,  orany mass work  under a single  tactical command, with a view to attaining any tactical objective.
    In the first place, with regard to naval forces, the Japanese Government, at the time of theWashington Conference, undertook to effect a reduction, and it firmfy intends to carry out sincerelythe terms of this Convention together with the other Powers.  Further, with regard to the  limi-tation of its army, the Japanese Government is at present engaged in elaborating a scheme thescope of which will depend upon the degree  of political  tranquillity in those countries  withwhich Japan is in close relationship.    The police forces required in Japan in time of peace for the purpose of maintaining domesticorder are determined by the size of the population and vary accordingly.  Under the present systempolice agents are appointed in the following proportions: one  for each 300 to  800&apos; inhabitantsin the  towns, and one  for each 600 to 2,000  in the  provinces. The other police  officials are appointed  in  sufficient  numbers  to  ensure  the carrying  out of control and other duties.  Theabove mentioned officials maintain order in  the interior of the country with the help of other organisations necessary  to the police.    The total expenditure entailed by these police services, according to the official enquiry ofMay 20th, 1921, amounts to 6r,967,899 yen per year, exclusive of expenditure on police officials of higher rank.    The Japanese Government also employs the military forces required for purposes of nationaldefence  to  maintain domestic order; hence it  is difficult to answer the question relating to theamount  of military forces required for the exclusive maintenance of domestic order.                                  I have the honour to be, etc.                                                                    (Signed) K.

The Latvian Government thoroughly investigated the question raised by this decision of theCouncil, but to its deep regret, it was unable to furnish you with its reply within the period which you originally specified.    In reply to your letter of April 13th,  I have the honour to inform you that my Governmentwelcomes  with the most genuine interest the  scheme for a general limitation of armaments, andfollows with the keenest sympathy all steps taken by the League of Nations which can be regardedas likely to lead to an effective and simultaneous limitation of  armaments in all countries.    I am glad to  be able to inform you that Latvia, faithful to the principles embodied in theThird Resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of  Nations  at its meeting on December14th, 1920, has begun to reduce her armaments.                                              I    As we had the honour to inform you in a letter, dated April 29th, 1922,  the Latvian Govern-ment is endeavouring gradually to curtail its military expenditure.  Thus this expenditure, whichin 1920 represented 27 % of the expenditure of the State, amounted in 1921  only to 16 % and in1922 only to 14.4 % of the entire expenditure.   In this manner, the military  burdens are reducedto the lowest level consistent with Latvia&apos;s obligation to safeguard her sovereignty  and defend the integrity of her frontiers.
    The policy of Latvia is essentially a policy of peace, but the Latvian Government recognises the fact that armaments can be effectively limited and that Latvia can carry out a comprehensive scheme for the reduction of  armaments  only if all the neighbouring countries accept a commonand definite plan for the reduction of armaments.   This agreement might assume the form of ageneral treaty laying down detailed provisions with regard to the limits of the armed forces which each of the contracting parties would undertake not  to exceed, and it should contain reciprocalengagements regarding the number of soldiers maintained under arms.    The geographical situation of our country, which is surrounded by many other States, rendersour policy for the reduction of armaments dependent upon that of our neighbours, and this depend-ence is still further accentuated by our somewhat lengthy coast-line (494 kilometres), by the factthat our land frontiers in no sense constitute a natural barrier against  external aggression, and again by the fact that  Latvia &apos;s immediate neighbours include States which do not belong to theLeague of Nations and  whose adhesion to the ideals and aims of the League of Nations is thereforehighly problematical.    Hence it follows that armaments can be effectively limited only by an international agreement.    The Latvian Government also attaches very great importance to the limitation, by an inter-national convention, of the traffic in and the manufacture of arms and munitions.    Any limitation merely of the number of armed men in a country does not imply a genuinereduction in the armaments  of that country so long as the latter contains inexhaustible suppliesof arms and munitions.  Most citizens in modern States are familiar with the art of war and theyacquire a knowledge of this art not only during their period of service with the colours but often,also, in various athletic associations.  They can therefore be mobilised rapidly and at any moment,provided a sufficient supply of arms and munitions is available.    The Latvian Government is therefore of opinion that the limitation of the traffic in and manu-f acture of arms and ammunition is the most effective method of securing a reduction in armaments.    Finally, in the view of the Latvian Government, the recognition of a territorial status quo for allcountries   a recognition which is in complete harmony with the Covenant of the League ofNations   will simplify the solution of the problem of the limitation of armaments.    The object of Article  10 of the Covenant is to provide a  certain guarantee for  the Membersof the  League of Nations against military attacks  from outside which threaten their territory or their  independence.    No agreement exists  with regard to the scope of the obligations respecting the  guaranteementioned in Article 10, and regarding the conditions under which the guarantee may be invoked.We are therefore of opinion that it would be desirable to declare, by means of a Convention con-cluded between all States, that the principle of the maintenance against any external aggression,of territorial integrity and political independence forms  an integral part of international public law;and at the same to define the scope of the obligation respecting this guarantee and the conditions under which it might be invoked.    As regards the military forces ntended to guarantee our national security, I have the  honourto inform you that the  Permanent Armaments Commission of the League of Nations agreed thafthe naval force indispensable  for Latvia should  consist of 4 destroyers, 4 submarines and 1,500mines, and her land forces of 20,000 soldiers permanently under arms.    We are of opinion that, in view of the present political situation, these figures really representthe minimum necessary in time of peace.    In the desire, however, to manifest its  pacific intentions towards its neighbours, the LatvianGovernment at present maintains a military force below this minimum.    Thus, the land forces  of Latvia at present amount to only 19,500 armed men, and her naval forces consist merely of one destroyer.    As regards the military and police forces indispensable  for the preservation of domestic order,we believe that a force of 5,000 armed men will suffice.

L. 54. 1922. IX,  with regard to a scheme for the reduction of national  arma-ments, I have  the honour to inform Your Excellency that:    (1)  The frontiers of Lithuania measure about r,597 kilometres, that,  is to say: the frontier between Lithuania and Latvia measures 590 kilometres; that established  with Soviet Russia bythe Moscow Treaty of July 12th,  1920,  570  kilometres; the remainder of the frontier as far as germany, which was not defined in the said Treaty, measures, in a straight line, perhaps 30 kilo-metres ; the frontier between Lithuania and Germany covers 387 kilometres; and the distance along the Baltic Sea is 20 kilometres.   In view of the absence of natural obstacles which might help todefend these frontiers and to render approach difficult, it is indispensable, for the purpose of guard-ing them, to maintain in time of peace three regiments of frontier guards, or 5,800 men.    (2)  Lithuania consists almost entirely of a plain, crossed here and there by low hills; and thereare no important natural obstacles either on her frontiers or in the interior of  the country whichmight present difficulties for military operations; large armies could therefore  be manoeuvred inLithuania with perfect ease.    Accordingly, in order to be prepared against attack, Lithuania is compelled, even in peace-time, to provide military training  for all physically fit men without exception, and to maintain a system enabling her to call all citizens to arms in the shortest possible time, to organise themand to train them for their active service.    (3)  The circumstances explained in paragraph 2 above in themselves make the defence of thecountry difficult, but they derive an added importance from the peculiar  situation of Lithuania,surrounded by three neighbouring Powers  - Russia, Poland and Germany,  each of which, con-sidered  separately, is far more powerful from every point of view than Lithuania.    For this reason it is essential for the defence of the country that Lithuania should maintain in peace-time  a contingent of troops numbering at least 30,000 men, whose duties must includethe maintenance of public order within the country.    As  regards the expenditure required for the upkeep of the Lithuanian Army, it is very difficult,in view  of the instability of the exchanges, to make a definite statement at present.              I have the honour to be, etc.,                                                              (Signed)  T.

QUINONES DE LEON,     President of the Council of the            League of Nations, Geneva.
1 TREPLY OF LUXEMBURGLUXEMBURG, July  ist,  1922.Sir,    In reply to the request contained in Your Excellency&apos;s letter of April 13th last, I have the honour to state below the considerations regarding the question of the reduction of armamentswhich the Grand-Ducal Government feels called upon to submit, in respect of the special points referred to by the Temporary Commission..    Entirely surrounded as it is, by France, Belgium and Germany, the Grand-Duchy of luxembourg -burg, with its area of 259,000 hectares and its population of 264,000, has  never been and neverwill be able to defend its territory by force of arms against its powerful neighbours.  It has thereforealways based its security on the faith of treaties and on the respect due to its independence andsovereignty.  The  war did not change these conditions,  which, together with the principle  of neutrality laid  down in the Constitution, prevent the Grand-Ducal  Government  from assumingmilitary obligations of an international nature.   The Grand-Duchy, therefore, is not a party  toany military treaty with another country.   It forms part of the League of Nations, and as theLeague does not impose on any country the obligation to maintain an army or to take active partin international military operations of any kind,  the Grand-Duchy has no international militaryobligations.    The armed forces of the Grand-Duchy of Luxemburg,  which are intended solely to maintaininternal order and  security, are at  present composed  of a company of gendarmes  182  strong(officers included),  and 250 volunteers commanded by four officers.    Post-war events, however, have proved the inadequacy of these forces  to  maintain order under all circumstances.  A change in the present situation is therefore  in contemplation,  andthe draft of a  bill to this effect has been submitted to the competent authorities. This draftdoes not affect the composition of the gendarmerie, which will be maintained at its present strength :but the voluntary system would be superseded  by  universal  compulsory  service  in a police force.  This  police  force would consist of a maximum of 3,000 men, drafted in levies of 300 meneach at the rate of 1,000 men annually.  The length of service is fixed at three  years.  During thisperiod the men would undergo a course of instructional training lasting 90 days in the first year andwould undergo further training for 15 days in each of the two following years.  In the intervals of these periods of training, the men will return  to their  homes or will remain at the disposalof the Government, which has the power to mobilise the whole or a part of this force in the eventof serious  disturbances, or in case  of emergencies.  The force  normally under arms  will number500 men, together with instructors.    The annual expenditure involved by the police force will amount to about 2 million  francs.                                  I have the honour to be,  etc.                                                                    (Signed) REUTER.

- 6o  -1 8                            REPLY OF THE NETHERLANDSSir,    In a letter dated April 13th, 1922, the acting President of the Council of the League of nations was good enough to ask the Government of the Netherlands to furnish, for the use of the Tempo-rary Mixed Commission for the Reduction of Armaments, a statement of the considerations whichit might wish  to submit with regard to the requirements of its national security, its international obligations, its geographical situation,  and its special circumstances, and, in particular, to indicateseparately, as  far as possible, the police and military forces which  it considers necessary for itsinternal  security, and the  expenditure  entailed thereby.    In  reply to this request, I am instructed to transmit to you herewith the statement required.                       I have the honour to be, Sir, etc.                                                             (Signed) A. BAUD,                                                                        For the Minister.To Sir Eric DKUMMOND,        Secretary-General,  League of Nations,                      Geneva.STATEMENT.                          I. INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS.The  Netherlands have undertaken no international  engagements  of a  military character.                              II.   GEOGRAPHICAL  SITUATION.A. The Netherlands.    From a military point of view, the geographical character and situation of the Netherlandsare chiefly determined:     1. By the land frontiers, which are about 400 kilometers long and are quite open, irregularand without natural obstacles of any importance. These frontiers would greatly facilitate the oper-ations of  an invading  army;    2. By the coast-line, which is about 350 kilometers long, is easy of access in many places and provides good harbours.  It is washed by the North Sea, the  most important sea-route betweenthe Bight of Heligoland  and the Baltic Sea on the  one  side,  and the Atlantic and the channel ports on the other side;    3. By the fact that several navigable international waterways flow through the netherlands and reach the sea in their territory;    4. By the narrowness of the territory, which necessitates special provisions  for its defence.    Furthermore, it must be remembered  that  the Netherlands are situated at the northernextremity of a possible battle front in Western Europe, and that the  great estuaries can be used as bases for offensive naval operations, or as lines of advance into the Continent.  In case of a european war, this gives the territory of the Netherlands a special strategic importance.B. The Dutch Indies.    From a strategical  standpoint, the geographical character  and  situation of these islandsare determined chiefly by the fact that they form an extensive  insular territory situated uponthe most  important lines of communication between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.

- 6i  -    From what has already been said  with regard  to  the geographical character  and positionof the Netherlands and the Dutch Colonies,  it follows that, in order to assure its national safety and the maintenance of its neutrality, the Kingdom urgently requires an army and a fleet of suffi-cient strength.                               III.  SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.    With regard to the  special circumstances which the Netherlands might urge, it should be pointed out that the Colonies to be defended are at a considerable distance from the mother-country.                                 IV.  INTERNAL SECURITY.A. The  Netherlands.    At present  the maintenance of internal order is entrusted to the following forces:     i. The  national and local police forces;    2. Certain  special units of the Army.    In  1922, the expenditure entailed by the national police forces (including the Royal MountedPolice and the military police), was about 13,500,000 florins.B. The  Colonies.    For the maintenance of internal order  and security, the following troops  arc available andindispensable:     1.  In the Dutch Indies, the Colonial Army and the armed police forces;    2.  In Surinam and in Curacao, certain units of the Colonial Army.    The cost of the armed police forces in the Dutch Indies amounts, in round figures, to 7 millionflorins per annum.19REPLY  OF NORWAY[Translation.]      MINISTRY                                           CHRISTIANIA,  July 31st, 1922.FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.Sir,    In his letter of April 13th last, the Acting President of the Council of the League of nations was good  enough to request the Royal Government to furnish a statement of the considerations which it might wish to urge in regard to the requirements of its national safety, its international obligations,  its geographical situation and its special conditions, and, in particular, to indicateseparately the police and military forces which it considered indispensable for the preservation of domestic order, and the  expenditure thereby entailed.    In answer to that letter, I have the honour to inform you  that:     The Defence Commission of 1920  (La Commission de Defense de ig2o) was appointed  inorder to study and put forward proposals for the future organisation of the defence of the King-dom, taking into special consideration the circumstances mentioned in the letter of the Presidentof the Council. (See the memorandum which accompanied the letter1 addressed to you by M.Michelet on May  12th, 1921.)  The work of the Commission has not yet been completed, and theGovernment of the King does not, therefore, consider that at the present moment it can express a definite and detailed opinion with regard to the defensive forces which it considers indispensablein order to  guarantee  the national safety of the country.    The Government of the King will  therefore limit itself to the following remarks of a general character.1 This letter was distributed to the members of the Temporary Mixed Commission on June 7th, -1.921.
REPLY OF POLAND                                             I[Translation.]                                                            WARSAW, June 28th, 1922.Your Excellency,     In accordance with the Resolution of the Second Assembly of the League of Nations and YourExcellency&apos;s Note of April 13th, 1922, I venture to submit a statement of the views of the PolishGovernment on the requirements of Polish national security, and also on the geographical situationand  special conditions of Poland.     The Polish Government has followed with  the keenest interest the progress achieved by theLeague  of Nations in its beneficent work for international peace, and will gladly do its utmost to help in the attainment of this end. It therefore readily avails itself of the opportunity of meetingthe wishes expressed by the League of Nations,  by supplying it  with  all essential information regarding Poland&apos;s military establishment.  Only recently, the Polish Government transmitted to the Secretariat without delay its replies to the questionnaires of the League dated March 8th,1921, and April 25th,  1921.                                    -     In its untiring efforts to fulfil the  steadfast desire of the entire Polish nation by pursuing apolicy of pacific  evolution, the Polish Government has already  made  considerable reductions in its armed forces and military expenditure, within limits  compatible with the security of thecountry.  ,           &apos;   &apos;  The demobilisation of the army has reduced the strength from 960,000 in 1920 to the presentpeace footing of 260,000 men.  &apos;                 .   ,     The reduction of the war budget as shown in the reply to  the Note from the Council of theLeague  of Nations dated January 12th,  1922,  amounts to at least 50 % as compared  with thearmy of 1920.                                                          &quot;     The invitation sent to the Polish Delegate to sit on the Temporary Disarmament Commission jjjwas  welcomed by Polish public opinion, which desired that in this important question poland should work hand in hand with the other States under the direction of the League of  Nations.She would thus be in a position to take part in the scientific preparation of the plan of general disarment prepared by the Temporary Mixed Commission, and also in the search for  methodsof putting this plan into practice step by step, with the gradual development of normal international relations in Europe.    There is no country amongst those with which Norway can be compared, as regards its poli-tical and military situation, in which military expenses are so low as in Norway.  It would thereforebe much more difficult for Norway to effect an important reduction of its expenses than for anyother of the countries which are placed in a  similar situation.    As for the special conditions which are particularly important in order to settle the effectiveswhich are necessary for the defence of the country, I would draw your attention to the fact thatthe land frontiers of this Kingdom are  very long, and its sea-board even longer.  Moreover, com-munications between its different; provinces are often  too little developed  or too liable to be cut in case of war.    As for  the police and military forces which are absolutely indispensable for the internal security of the Kingdom, my Government desires me to put forward the following considerations:-    In the history of Norway, it is very seldom that recourse has been had to military force inorder to keep internal order.  There is no special organisation in  existence (such  as corps de gen-darmerie, etc.)  for the keeping  of order in the interior and along the frontiers, nor is it likely that the establishment of such a corps will be necessary in the future. If the information requestedis an indication of the expenses entailed by the keeping of public safety in the interior of the country,the only answer that could be given is that normally there are no other expenses than those causedby  the civil police.    Finally, it must be noticed that Norway has no other international relations likely to influence the organisation of its defence than those arising from her membership of the League of Nations.    I would, however, add that, in virtue of the Convention signed between Norway and Swedenon October 26th, 1905, a neutral zone has been established on both sides of the common frontier.                                I  have the honour, etc.                                -                      (Signed) Joh. Ludv. MOWINCKEL.
    The attached memorandum is a statement of the reasons which have led the Polish Govern-ment  to reduce its armed forces. I consider that it may also prove helpful in  throwing furtherlight upon the main features in the special situation of certain States Members  of the League ofNations. These States, while limiting their armed forces, both in the interest of the general causeof peace and also in order to  lighten the burdens which weigh upon their own peoples, cannotlose sight for a single moment  of the inexorable demands of practical reality, which impose upon them  the obligation of reconciling the programme of the limitation of their armed  forces withthe conditions essential to their own security.                                   I have the honour to be,  etc.,                                                           (Signed) S.

In the recommendation of the Second Assembly of the League of Nations, the Governmentsof States forming part of the League are invited to express their opinions on the possibility of reducing armaments, taking into account their national security,  international engagements,geographical situation and special circumstances.    In reply to this recommendation, the Polish Government has the honour to submit the follow-ng considerations:                                 GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION.General Situation.    Poland&apos;s geographical situation renders the defence of the country extremely difficult.  Forcenturies the main European roads leading from the west, south-west and south to the vast terri-tories extending from the Gulf of Finland and the White Sea as far as the steppes  of the black sea have met in Poland.    All the natural arteries of communication crossing Poland intersect each other in a relatively small area, not  more than 300  kilometres wide from the  middle Vistula, between its junctionwith the San and the mouth of  the Vistula.    Her central situation, in relation to her neighbours, who are able to use Polish territory asan essential means of communication, does indeed bring to  Poland considerable political and com-mercial advantages, but it also involves her in the necessity of being always on her guard and pre-pared to defend herself.  The past has taught us that possession  of a territory as important asPoland from the commercial and military points of view has always roused the cupidity of neigh-bouring Powers, a cupidity increased with  every indication of the weakness of the  Polish State.    In all  the wars waged by Poland  against the  aggressions of her neighbours, the regions ofthe middle Vistula were the chief aim of the operations of enemy invaders.  This  was the  casein the  campaign of 1656, when Warsaw was threatened by the Swedes and Brandenburgers fromthe north,  the Muscovite troops from  the  north-east and the Cossacks from the south.  It wasthe case again in  the Polono-Russian  and Polono-Prussian wars of 1792 and 1794, and those of1831 and 1920.    In the world war, the Austrian and German offensives of 1914-15 were, for similar reasons,concentrated on the territory adjoining this part of the Vistula. Once the occupation of the middleVistula by the Central Empires was completed, Russia not only definitely lost the greater  partof Poland,  but her troops, despite their numerical  superiority, were effectively held in check.Position of the Economic Centres  and Natural Wealth of the  Country.    To the difficulties of defence due to the geographical situation of Poland must be added thenecessity of defending the frontier territories which are essential to preserve the  life  of thenation. In the  first  place, the  coal-bearing region must be considered.  The only deposits ofcoal in Poland are situated in the extreme south-west, on the  actual frontier between  poland and Germany, in the neighbourhood of Sosnowiec, west of Krakow and in Upper Silesia.  Thenew Polono-German frontier in Upper  Silesia as also the   former frontier,  bisects the coal regionin such a way that the pit-heads are not only visible from the other side of the frontier, but manyof them are actually within rifle range.  Poland&apos;s neighbours, on the other hand, possess depositsat a great distance from the frontier,   the  Germans in Westphalia and Saxony, and the russians in the basin of the Don.
     In this territory are found, besides coal, the Polish deposits of zinc and lead, and also a largeproportion of the iron ore beds which extend west of Czestochowa as far as Upper Silesia.  ThePolish iron ore deposits further from the frontier are to be found along the  northern slopes ofthe mountains  of the Holy Cross.  The copper deposits in the same region  are comparativelypoor and cannot be worked unless Upper Silesian coal   the only coke-producing coal in Poland  can be brought to them.     The chief industries   particularly the metal-working and chemical industries   are, owingto the situation of the  raw materials, mainly  grouped on the territory bordering the frontier.Except for a few metal-working factories around Warsaw, in the Holy Cross mountains and thenorthern slope of the Carpathians, all the great industries  of Poland are concentrated within the restricted area of Upper Silesia, and also in the neighbouring region of Sosnowiec and Czestochova,which can easily be invaded from the German side in a day or a day and a-half&apos;s march; moreover,most of this region would actually be under fire from the neighbouring States without any needfor the latter&apos;s troops to cross the frontier.Communications.     The lines of communication in Poland are  naturally directed towards a common centre andtherefore the strategic lines of attack of her enemies are directed towards the same centre.  Fur-ther, the  natural wealth  of  Poland is scattered in  outlying  districts.  It  follows, therefore,that the Polish system of communication is  inadequate,  and does not fulfil any of the require-ments dictated by natural conditions.  This situation is due to the fact that,  since the partition of Poland, the economic life of each of the three former parts of Poland   Russian, German and austrian   has developed quite independently of the other.     In consequence of the pronounced tendency of each of the three Partitioning States to stifle theeconomic life of Poland  in general, and in particular to prevent any possible contact between  thethree parts of the country, virtual zones of isolation, deprived of any means of mutual communi-cation, have been formed between Russian Poland on  the one hand, and Galicia and the province of Posen on the other.  Up to the time of the Great War, there were only two  lines of railway  the Warsaw-Vienna and Brody-Radziwillow-Zdolbunowo lines   along the whole frontier betweenGalicia and Russian Poland, a distance of more than 450 kilometres.  The termini of the otherlines were situated on the frontier at Szcyucin,  Nadbrzezie, Belzec (Tarnobrzeg), Sokal and  Sto-janow.  Similarly, along the frontier  between  Russian Poland and the province of Posen   a distance of about 300 kilometres   only one railway existed.    As a result of the policy hitherto pursued by the Partitioning States, in the territory of thePolish Republic, communication between the principal centres of Poland is  effected by  meansof secondary and very devious routes.  The distance, as the crow flies, between Warsaw and Posenis only 280 kilometres,  whereas  until recently  the route  by rail  amounted to 390 kilometres.Between Warsaw and Lvov the direct distance is only 350 kilometres, but the distance  by  railis 558 kilometres, that is to say, 60 % longer.   A long time will be required before the consequences of this policy of the Partitioning States can be eliminated.Communications with Foreign Countries.    As regards communications with allied States, the position of Poland is equally unfavourable.Communication between Poland and  non-neighbouring States can only be carried on throughthe narrow Polish corridor leading to the Polish littoral, 70 kilometres in length, and the Port of danzig.  This sole means of communication might be cut off by an invader in a few days.    Apart  from the Polish corridor, Poland could, if  attacked during a war, utilise to a certain extent the  ports of her  allies,  Roumania and Latvia,  of course,  subject to the consent of their governments.  But here again  considerable difficulties would be encountered in  safeguardingcommunications.   The corridor connecting Poland with Latvia is as long as the Danzig corridor;it is  moreover, situated  far from the centre of the country, so that, in spite of its greater width,it is no less difficult to guard.   Access to the Roumanian ports is obtained along the south-eastern frontier of  the country  in the immediate neighbourhood of the Polish-Ukraine frontier.  Landtransit cannot be considered as safe in view of the fact that it depends on the consent of severalStates, viz., Czechoslovakia,  Austria  and Switzerland, or Czechoslovakia,  Austria  and Italy,or Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Serb-Croat-Slovene State, and Italy.Geographical Conditions  of the Eastern Frontier.    The above-mentioned difficulties of defence become even more  evident when it is rememberedthat  the territory of Poland is surrounded on its three most accessible sides by States which have remained outside the League of Nations and which have refused to enter into any obligations withregard to causing new wars and  the tendency towards bringing about a universal social upheaval(Russia and Germany).   The actual frontier between  Poland and Soviet Russia extends for a distance of 1,072 kilometres, of which scarcely 300 kilometres   that  is, less  than one-third  in Polesia offer any natural defence.  Poland possesses only  a small part even  of this latter terri-tory, which, owing to its swamps, might form for her  a comparatively defensible frontier region.Most of it is situated in  Russia -  a fact which greatly diminishes its value from the point of viewof strategic defence.   Moreover,  this area can and will always be turned by the  Russians.  Russia,unlike Poland, can in fact  utilise her part of  Polesia for  the purpose  of offensive operations,because she possesses a  railway there which divides Polesia from north to south, and also several
very convenient natural roads.   Polesia, moreover, is by no means an impassable region.  In drysummers and in winter it- does not offer any great difficulties for the passage of troops.Geographical Conditions of the Western Frontier.    Again, in the south-west, the west,  and part of the north, Poland borders upon Germanyalong a distance of 1,552  kilometres,  of which 574 kilometres are situated to the north along theenclave of East Prussia.  This frontier along its whole length possesses no natural obstacle of any kind, except for some dozen kilometres of marshy ground on the Oder.  There are no swamps orlakes or forest areas, still less mountains.   On the other hand, West Prussia  is protected in thesouth   that is to say, from the Polish side   by the barrier of the lakes and forests of Mazuria(Wald and Seesperre), and this barrier, already fairly strong by nature, was further strengthenedduring the recent war by formidable artificial  obstacles which are at present kept up  with thegreatest care.   Although more than  100  kilometres of the  frontier between the Danzig corridorand East Prussia are formed by the Vistula, this river cannot be considered as of any value as an obstacle, as Polish territory beyond  it, in an easterly direction, does not exceed 150 kilometresin width  before the  other  German  frontier is reached near  Choynice; in the event of war thisfrontier would obviously be threatened at the same time as the Prussian frontier.  It is difficultto conceive of any effective defence of the frontiers on two  fronts in a corridor having an averagewidth of 150 kilometres, which, moreover, is  reduced in the  north to a width of only 45 kilometresfor a distance of 300 kilometres as the crow flies. It should be added that the frontiers of thiscorridor are only 175 kilometres,  and in  some cases 140 kilometres distant from great german military centres such as Stettin and Konigsberg, which would form excellent bases of operations.     The same considerations apply to the whole of the Western frontier, the chief centres of thePolish State lying in proximity to that frontier  Warsaw is scarcely 125 km distant as the crowflies  from West Prussia.  Along the whole of the Polish frontier on the Oder, and immediately tothe East on the German side, there lies  a dense system of double-track railways.  This railway system may at any moment be used  as a basis of operations against Poland. It includes the mainlines of Stettin, recently entirely reconstructed, Kustrin,  Frankfort-on-Oder, Guben  Griinberg,Glogau, Breslau and  Opole, and the secondary lines of Prenzlau,  Eberswalde, Berlin, Kottbus,Gorlitz and Liegnitz.  On the Polish side, on the other hand,  apart from Poznah (Posen), Thornwith Bydgoszcz-Bromberg, and  Lodz, there is  nothing to  set against  this network of railways,in view of the inadequacy of the lines of communication between the Western provinces and therest  of the country.Ratio of the Length of the Frontier to  the Area and to the Density of the Population.     The conditions of Poland are much less advantageous than  those of her neighbours with regardto the ratio between the  length of the frontier to be defended and the area and population of thecountry.  Whereas the Reich contains 38,653 inhabitants per kilometre of the Germano-Polishfrontier, Poland  only has 17,397 to set against that figure. In comparison with Russia, the pro-portion is even more unfavourable:  for every kilometre of the Russian frontier there.are 87,273citizens of the Soviet Republics,  and only 24,545 Poles. Moreover, it must be remembered thatalmost the whole frontier line of Poland, except the 70 km. of coast-line,  requires simultaneousdefence, and that two-thirds of the frontier must be regarded as more or less threatened.  germany is not in a similar position, still less is  Russia; the part of their frontiers exposed to danger is only an insignificant fraction of the whole, so that these States will always be in  a position to maintainthe greater proportion of their military forces on the very borders of Poland.     The geographical situation of Poland may be characterised shortly in the following manner:      1. A flat country, unprovided with  natural obstacles  both on nine-tenths of the threatenedfrontiers  and along the  lines of communication, which,  with  the exception of two near the borders, lead from the circumference to the centre of Poland, thus offering advantages for aconcentric advance of enemy forces.     2. The mining centres and most of the industrial centres,  without which it would be quite impossible to maintain the life of the country, are situated on the circumference.Special Conditions of External Relations.      It is essential   and the Polish  Government cannot pass the matter over in silence   to draw attention to the  still unsettled  relations existing  between the Polish State and  the countries in its immediate neighbourhood.      Although the  Treaty of Riga has determined and defined the reciprocal relations between Poland and her Eastern neighbours, Russia and the Ukraine, neither public opinion nor the Govern- ment, which is responsible to the nation, can forget that it  is within the boundaries of the Russian State that the headquarters of the  Executive Committee of the Third International are situated, whose admitted and openly proclaimed object is to bring about a social revolution throughout the world, and particularly in neighbouring countries, first of all in Poland.      The immediate  neighbourhood of the Federated Republic of Russian Soviets, which  is in possession  of a very large army, places Poland in quite a different position  from that in which she  would be if States  belonging to the League of Nations were her neighbours.      Owing to the contiguity of the western frontier of Poland with that of the German Reich, the  Polish Government,  without  any   desire to  interfere  in German affairs and  without the slightest intention of accusing  anybody, nevertheless feels  bound to point out that its appre-
apprehensions are justified, in view of many facts tending to show that the disarmament of germany which, in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, was declared to be indispensable in order to arrive  ^at a general limitation of armaments, is at present still very far from complete.     After the Great War, Poland resumed her place  among European States by virtue of the Treatyof Versailles, and regained the provinces which during long years had lain under a foreign yoke.The disinclination of her neighbours to accept this new state of affairs might manifest itself insuch ways as to create difficulties in the normal development of those friendly relations between poland and her neighbours, which the whole country desires,  but which are still systematicallyobstructed by powerful parties in Germany.  These facts necessitate the greatest circumspectionon the part  of the  Polish Government  in reducing  to  a  minimum the  military forces capableof ensuring the effective defence of its frontiers.I nadequacy of Moral Guarantees.     In considering the characteristics, already referred to,  of the two States bordering on Poland,it  should be  added that  neither are Members of the League of Nations.   Consequently, the legal and moral obligations set forth in the Covenant for ensuring  the  pacific  settlement of disputes between Members of the League of Nations have no binding force either for Germany or for SovietRussia.     If the frontiers of Poland are compared from this point of view with those of other States, thedisadvantageous position of Poland is self-evident.     Whereas, for example, the length of exposed frontier-line in Poland is 2,624 km., it is only240 km. in the case of France, and 260 km. in the case of Italy.Special Internal Conditions.     Apart from these considerations regarding external conditions, there exist grounds for appre-nension arising out of the internal situation of Poland.     In comparing the potential military strength  of Poland and that of the States which,  likeher, only regained their independence after the Great War with the military forces of all other-States, the inferiority of the newly created States in this connection must be admitted.     The States with military traditions, which devoted all their efforts  to  the development oftheir fighting forces, and particularly those which  took  an active part in the Great War, have attheir disposal, even after a considerable measure of disarmament, a large number of troops trainedon a  uniform system; they possess  an experienced administrative organisation,  and  abundanttechnical resources, as well  as munition factories, aspl^xiating gases,  aircraft and tanks, and finally they have control of workshops  actually used, or  available if necessary, for the needs ofthe army and for purposes of war.     Poland lacks these resources, or at any rate she only possesses them to a very limited extent.     Neither does she possess well-trained reserves.   The number of soldiers who served in the ranks of the Polish Army from the date of mobilisation in 1918 up to the conclusion  of the Treatyof Riga, was quite inadequate for the requirements of the country and in comparison with theforces of the neighbouring States;moreover,it could not be regarded as numerically equivalent tothe troops at the disposal of the States which took  an active part in the Great War.  Whereasduring the war as large a proportion as 20 % of the population of those States served in the. army,the greatest strength attained by the Polish Army  during the campaigns of 1919 and 1920, hardlyamounted to 960,000 men, viz., 3.55 % of the population.     The improvised character of the army, all the organisation of which has had to be created and  for  the  training of  which  the most  elementary instruction has  been found  necessary,seriously lessens the fighting value of the soldiers who have served in the ranks of the Polish Army.     The position is similar with  regard to  war supplies.  The Great  War left Poland denudedof stores.  The war material at the disposal of the  army during the war against Soviet Russia wasscarcely sufficient to meet the most pressing requirements.     The military factories in a position to supply  the needs of the army are at present in an em- bryonic state.  Only very vigorous efforts could  supply  this deficiency to a certain extent, and even then time would be required.   At the present moment this inferiority exists, and is the cause of quite exceptional conditions which must be taken  into account in giving an outline  of the position.CONCLUSIONS.    The considerations mentioned above explain clearly  the difficult and  exceptional positionof Poland.   Poland is justly proud of her historic role as the defender of Western civilisation andof the achievements of peace against the dangers of invasion and of war.    In  order to play her part as defender, she is compelled to make perpetual efforts and permanentsacrifices.    The difficult position in which she is placed cannot, however, destroy her faith in the realisa-tion of peace among the nations or prevent her from working to achieve this end.    Natural conditions themselves urge Poland to co-operate in attempts to regulate international relations without resorting to force of arms.    Poland, of all European States, has the greatest  interest in the realisation of universal peace and disarmament.
    The idea of disarmament is welcomed as warmly by Government circles as by the whole Polishnation without exception.Strength and Organisation of the Military Forces of Poland.    With a view to solving the difficult problem of  ensuring to the State the forces indispensablefor its defence,  the  Polish Government,  while  making  as large reductions  as possible inthe active strength  of  the  army  and  in  the  military  budget, decided   upon  the  following figures:                      30 divisions of infantryr and                      10 brigades of cavalry,with a two years&apos; period of military service and a peace strength of 275,000 men.    These troops constitute the military force required for the protection of  the frontiers in caseof mobilisation, and are the cadres of the reserve units.    Further, the Polish State, with a view to keeping order, maintains a police force and  also acertain number  of Customs officials  at the  disposal of  the  Ministry  of the Interior.  Thetotal  of these police  and Customs forces  which,  moreover,  are not called  upon to  undergomilitary instruction and which are not under the control of the Military Authorities, is not  higherthan 60,000 men.    In consideration  of  the general geographical  situation of Poland, her open frontiers, thedensity of her population, the consequences of her prolonged enslavement and finally the necessityfor establishing uniform methods of work in the army, it must be stated that this total of 275,000men is an indispensable minimum required to safeguard the most essential interests of the State.

I  have the honour to  be, etc.,                                                                   (Signed)  ASKENAZY.    His  Excellency         Monsieur QUINONES  DE LE6N,             Ambassador, Acting President                 of the Council of the                     League of Nations.  [Translation]                                       MEMORANDUM      The considerations set forth in the Polish Governments memorandum dated June 26th last with  regard to the exigencies of national security, international obligations, the geographical situation  and the special conditions of Poland in relation to the question of land disarmament, show that the  Republic of Poland is also specially interested in the solution of the problem of naval disarmament.      It must, however, be pointed out that the negotiations between the Principal Powers at  Washington could only be brought to such a satisfactory conclusion by reason of the fact that the  development of their naval forces had arrived at a point beyond which it was difficult to advancek without gravely  compromising the  economic existence of  those States.      The general considerations which prevailed at the Washington Conference could not properly  be applied to Poland, a State which has been reconstituted as a result of the Great War.  It would  not therefore be just to require her to accept, as the basis of her naval policy, the principle of the  stahis quo  at sea  as it existed in November 1921.      Poland, which has a population of approximately 27 million inhabitants within an area of  386,000 sq. km. cannot occupy the position assigned to her in Europe alike from a political and
from an economic point of view until she can make use in perfect safety of the sea routes whichconnect Poland with the rest of the world. It should be observed that this security must be assuredto her without reference to the good-will or ill-will of her immediate neighbours.    Seeing that  the possibility of limiting the defensive forces of a country is in direct relationto the strength  of the offensive forces of the neighbouring countries,  Poland is compelled notonly to maintain  but also to  increase her present naval forces.    In view of the fact that the free use at all times of sea routes is an essential corollary of freeaccess to the sea, the Polish Government feels compelled  to ensure for  Poland the developmentof a naval force  which, though moderate, shall yet be sufficient to safeguard the security of hercoast-line to the extent that is considered necessary by the States which already possess a navy.    Poland, which only desires the application to herself of the most elementary right of equalitybetween nations, cannot be suspected of aggressive designs, if only by reason of the geographicalconfiguration  of her  coast-line.    It will be realised from what has  already been said that the Polish naval forces will in every case be so greatly inferior to the naval forces of the Great Powers that they could not,  even inthe future, play any  important  part in the establishment of naval equilibrium.    Poland merely seeks to obtain security within the limits of her frontiers as well as  the fullenjoyment of freedom at sea.31REPLY  OF  THE SERB-CROAT-SLOVENE STATEDELEGATE OF THE SERB-CROAT-SLOVENES        TO  THE  ASSEMBLY                               GENEVA, September 9th, 1922.    OF THE LEAGUE OF  NATIONS.[Translation.]Sir,    In a letter dated April 13 th, the Council of the League of Nations was good enough to request the Royal Government to furnish &quot;a statement of the considerations it may wish to urge in regardto the requirements of its national security, its international obligations, its geographical situationand its special conditions.&quot;    The Royal Government has examined with all attention this request of the Council and has instructed me to give you the following answer:    The people  of the Kingdom  of the Serb-Croat-Slovenes, and more especially that part of it which lies in the old Kingdom of Serbia and  which has had to suffer three successive wars since1912, cannot but congratulate itself upon the noble efforts made by the  League of Nations witha view to a progressive reduction of armaments.    Nevertheless, apart  from the requirements of  its national defence,  the  Royal Governmentfeels bound to draw the attention of the Council to the following considerations:A.  National Safety.    The Kingdom of the Serb-Croat-Slovenes possesses frontiers with seven different States, three ofwhich are ex-allies of the Central Powers.   Amongst these are some which have not fulfilled theirinternational obligations and which, moreover, cannot be said to be in a stable internal situation.B.   Geographical Situation.     The frontiers of our State are extremely developed and their length is great as compared withthe figure of our population.  The total length of our frontiers is no less than,000 kms., of which1,800 kms. are common frontiers with ex-enemy States.C.  Special Conditions.     1.   The political situation in the neighbouring States, as in Central  Europe generally, is notyet well established.     2.   The barracks, hospitals, Pasteur Institutes, geographical services, etc.   which, thoughunder military management, are intended for public service   have been  destroyed by the enemy in  the  course of the last  war.   Their repair and reconstruction  naturally  entail  considerable expense, which burdens the budget of the War Ministry to the prejudice of real military expenses.     3.   The population of the recently liberated provinces having as yet had no adequate militarytraining, and in some  cases no military training at all, it is indispensable to give them  some in-struction, however elementary in character, with a view to the defence of the country.     4.   Following upon the systematic devastations carried out during the war by our enemies, the army has to take a considerable  part in the  reconstruction of the devastated regions --
re-establishment, of communications,  rebuilding of bridges, etc.  The army will thus be obliged to lend its hand in the reconstruction of the territory for several years to come.  Moreover, in somecases it has to fulfil the duties of customs guards and  of gendarmerie, thus again increasing thebudget of the War Ministry, instead of, as in ordinary  times, that of other departments.    5.   Despite the  reasons given,  which  entail exceptional  expenditure, the  Royal Govern-ment, ever faithful to the peaceful spirit of its people,  and desirous on the other hand to help inthe great effort of the League of Nations, has considerably curtailed the budget of the War Ministry.Thus the military expenditure  which in 1921 amounted  to 140^25,000 gold francs, has beenreduced to 70,500,000 gold francs for 1922.    No comparison with the military budget for 1912  is possible, since Serbia was at that time a country of 50,000 sq.  kms. and 3 million people,  while to-day the Kingdom of the Serb-Croat-Slovenes covers 250,000 sq.  kms. and is populated by about 12 million inhabitants.    The  effort made by the Kingdom of the Serb-Groat-Slovenes in the direction of disarmamentwill best  be appreciated once it  is noticed that the military expenditure of Switzerland, the sur-face of which is six times smaller and the population three times less numerous,  amounts to 60million gold francs.    The law on military organisation,  which has not yet been voted on account of the requirementsof the new  constitution, will be inspired in the same peaceful spirit which has led the Governmentto reduce the military expenditure for this year by about 50 %.    I have the honour to be, Sir, etc.                                                     (Signed)   M.

Div. 0. N&quot; 101.                                        PARIS, June 30th, 1922.Sir,    His Siamese Majesty&apos;s Minister for Foreign Affairs has, by telegraph, instructed me to acknow-ledge  receipt of your letter No. G.L. 32. 1922.IX, under date April 13th, 1922, and in reply to statethat His Siamese Majesty&apos;s Government have no particular observations to submit with regardto the views relating to  the requirements of the national security,  international  obligations,geographical situation, and any special circumstances of Siam, except that they wish to assure the Council  and the Temporary Mixed Commission that  their armed force is  maintained  exclu-sively for defence and for maintaining internal peace and order or for the police purposes and thatthey have no intention to be aggressive at all.   They are  therefore ready to welcome any proposal made by the Commission which is calculated to prevent  international aggression and to preclude the maintenance of force for the purpose other than those of defence and internal police.   such proposal will always receive their most careful and sympathetic consideration.    His Siamese Majesty&apos;s Government wish further to point out that at the  present time, whenthe organisation of the  administration of the country on modern lines is being worked out andnot yet completed, the Army is employed in many civil undertakings, for example:    (1)  Medical.   The personnel of the Red Gross is drawn from the Army  Medical personnel;    (2)  The Military Engineering Corps is employed on railway construction;    (3)  The Military Survey Department is engaged on the cadastral survey of the country;    (4)  The  Military Aeronautical Department is developing  aviation for  commercial andpostal purposes.    If compulsory service exists in Siam, it is in great part with a view to helping to educate thepeople, not  only to teach them lessons of discipline but  also how to read and write and all other branches of general education.    For the reasons above and owing to the above special circumstances of Siam, it is extremelydifficult, if not actually  impossible, to draw hard   and    fast lines as to the definite number ofmilitary and police force considered indispensable for  the  preservation of domestic order and
also  the expenditure entailed thereby.  Such determination of the force can  be effected only when the  requirements  in the matter of preservation of domestic order are definitely  known,that is to say, only in the case of countries whose administi&apos;ative organisation is fully developed,which, as  has already been said, is not the case of Siam.   From this point of view, the latter isstill in the stage of transition and realisation.  However, His Siamese Majesty&apos;s Government sin-cerely hope that, with the above explanation of the special circumstances of Siam and the aboveassurances of their pacific intentions, the Commission will agree with them that there is  no necessity to reduce the existing armed force of Siam.             I have the honour to be, Sir,    Your obedient servant,                                                   (Signed) Luang Bhasha PARIVATRA,                                                             Charge d&apos;Affaires a.i.

Quihones de Leon, Acting President of the Council of theLeague of Nations, asked me   in conformity with a resolution passed by the Council at its sessionof July 20th   to furnish you as soon as possible with the statement of the Swedish Governmentconcerning the requirements of her national security, geographical situation, etc.,  which was asked for  in M. Hymans&apos; Note of  April 13th last.    In reply, I have the honour to inform you that the Commission mentioned in my letter ofJune 27th last, which has been entrusted with the examination, in its entirety,  of the questionof the future organisation of Sweden&apos;s national defences, has not yet been able to draw up itsreport.

Under these circumstances, the swedish government much regrets that it is still not in a position to furnish you with detailed information on this question.

REPLY OF SWITZERLAND  Translation.]  FEDERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT,     Foreign  Affairs Section.                                       BERNE,  July 8th, 1922.  Sir,     In a letter of April 13th last, confirmed by a letter of June 12th, the Council of the League lof Nations asked the  Government of the Confederation to send it &quot;a statement containing such  considerations as it might wish to submit with regard to the requirements of its national security,  international obligations, geographical situation and special circumstances,  and,  in particular,  indicating separately  (as far as possible) the police and military forces which it considers essential  for its internal security and also the expenditure thereby involved.&quot;     The Federal Council has  carefully considered this  request and has instructed us to reply as  follows:       Switzerland is fundamentally a peaceful  State, and  must  therefore  give her  unreserved  support to the  efforts  made  by the League of  Nations  to  secure the gradual reduction  of  armaments.  Nevertheless, it is an imperative duty for Switzerland to take the measures necessary  for self-defence in case of attack.   She cannot, moreover, lose sight of the fact that the Act of  November 20th, 1815, recognising and guaranteeing the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland and  the inviolability of her  territory   an Act which  was confirmed in the Declaration of London  dated February 13th, 1920   places upon Switzerland  an obligation to ensure by her own means  the inviolability of her territory and the maintenance of her neutrality.  Her frontiers are very  extensive in comparison with her population, and she is therefore compelled to maintain as large and  as well-equipped an army as possible.  This necessity is also a result of her geographical situation.  She is more exposed to the risk of becoming a theatre of war than countries  which are not, as  she is, situated in the centre of Europe.  In addition, she is surrounded by strongly-armed States    a fact which renders it still more imperative for her to maintain at a certan standard her state  of military preparedness.      Her  army, which  is merely militia, is organised on a  comparatively restricted basis.   The  training of recruits, for instance, amounts only to a period of 65 days for the infantry, 75 for  the  artillery and 90 for cavalry, and  the period of service afterwards performed by soldiers varies from  88 to 112 days, extended over a period  of more than  12 years. Similarly, as regards her actual  armaments, the condition of  her army is very far from that of the armies of other countries.  She  does not even possess  such war material as is generally admitted to-day to be absolutely essential.  Thus, she possesses  no heavy artillery at all,  her air fleet is inadequate,  she has no automatic  arms for  infantry,  mine-throwers,  * canons d&apos;accompagnement v  for  infant^, flame-projectors  or any  of  the material necessary  for  protection  against  poison gas.  It should be  added  that  the sections of Customs officials and the  police force, which in  other  countries are organised  on the military model  and form a fighting force by no means negligible, are entirely separate from  the army in our country, so that their assistance could not be counted upon for military operations.       Though all military activity was interrupted during  the years 1919 and 1920, and was  then  resumed on a very small scale,  army training is proceeding to-day on more extensive lines; but  neither  the  number of recruits  nor the  term of service is^on the same scale as that maintained  before the war  - although this scale  is prescribed  by  law.  Amongst the principal measures  passed with a view to  reducing  still further the military burdens of  the&quot;country, reference should  be made in  the first  place to the^postponement for one year of the period of liability for militaryf a service, the army being thereby deprived of a whole class of  trained troops; also, stricter regula-&apos;  ^tions have been introduced with regard to recruiting, as a result of which only 55 % of the men  of military  age were declared fit for service, whereas in previous years this proportion was 70 to  72 %; lastly, the courses of training provided for the older levies, etc., have been abolished.  The  question whether it will be possible to make still further restrictions  is at present under discussion.  Before our  military establishment is re-organised,  certain proposals to this effect  will probably  be submitted to Parliament  in the present year.
    As regards the present  organisation of the Swiss army, we would refer to the documents which we have already sent to the Disarmament  Section of the Secretariat of the  League ofNations.    In any case, and apart  from any measures which may still be taken towards reducing her military  burdens, Switzerland at present possesses a military establishment which,  comparedwith others, is extremely small. She is therefore justified in the belief that if the States Membersof the League  of Nations reduced their armaments in the same proportion, the problem of disar-mament  would be almost,  if not entirely, solved.

ArvrvEX in report ON LORD ESHER&apos;S PROPOSAL.    The Commission considered Lord Esher&apos;s scheme in so tar as it comes within the scope ofArticle 8 of the Covenant, which defines the object to be attained and the methods to be followedwhen drawing tip a scheme for the reduction  of armaments.    i.  The Commission fully realises the great value of Lord Eshers&apos; initiative, but it does notconsider that it is possible to accept a system for the reduction of armaments, such as that ofLord Esher&apos;s, based on co-efficients chosen in an  arbitrary manner.    Under Article 8 of the Covenant, the calculation of the requirements of national safety consti-tutes one of the essential bases for the reduction of armaments.  The first factor to be considered when drawing up such an estimate consists of the replies of the various Governments with regard totheir requirements.    At the same time, the Commission would like to call attention to the following points:    An estimate of the requirements of the national safety of any country cannot be completeunless it be based on an appreciation of the dangers threatening that country, that is to say,unless it takes into account the forces of neighbouring States and their political tendencies, noryet should such an estimate ignore the assistance that might be given by other States.    2.   However such an estimate is made, the Commission is of opinion that it would be desirableimmediately to take the necessary steps to find a method whereby the value of the national forcesof each State can be readily estimated. The Commission discussed the method proposed by LordEsher,  which consists in taking as the unit of measure an arbitrarily chosen numerical strengthof 30,000 men. The Commission is of opinion that mere numerical strength alone does not express the military force of a  State as, in modern warfare, in which man acts through war material, the combination constituting the armed unit is composed of certain proportions of men, or organisingstaffs,  and of material.    The question as to how these proportions can be estimated, not with a view to  imposing a standard unit on existing armies, but in order to be able to calculate the respective value of thosearmies, should be considered by the  Permanent Advisory Commission, to which Lord Esher&apos;scheme has been submitted  by the Council.    The Commission suggests that it might be possible to take as a unit of measure the combination of a certain strength and certain fixed sum of money representing the remaining factor of armament.    3.  The Commission examined the possible scope  of  and  methods for a  limitation of landarmaments.    (a) The Commission is of opinion that such a limitation should affect peace-time armamentsonly since there can be no question of limiting the effort made by a country should it carry out anational   mobilisation.    (b) The Commission recognises that if a limitation is to be effective, it is necessary that itshould simultaneously affect the strength of the troops (men or cadres) and material either directly or by an  indirect method of financial limitation.  Nevertheless,  it considers that it is unable togive a final opinion on this matter before having received the technical report from the PermanentAdvisory  Commission.    (c)   Lastly, the Commission considered  the  necessity, when dealing with the whole armed forces of a State, of distinguising between the uses to which they might be put. It was of opinionthat limitation should apply to the whole of the land forces intended for the defence of jthe mother-country, excluding those acknowledged  to be necessary for the occupation or defence of colonies and those devoted to the carrying out of international obligations of such a nature  or durationthat they would be unable to take part in the defence of the mother-country.  A special agreementsupplementary^ to the general reduction agreement should be made for the militation of colonial forces.     To sum up, the Commission cannot approve Lord Esher&apos;s scheme, but is of opinion that  theidea suggested in the scheme of fixing a method of estimating peace-time strengths is justified.     It believes  that the limitation of armaments must be imposed  on the peace-time strength,bearing in mind the essential factors on which such strength  is based.     It is of opinion that  this limitation should  not apply to forces that are  not utilised for thedefence of the metropolitan area of  each State.     Finally, it is of opinion that a special supplementary agreement should be contemplated for the limitation of forces used to maintain order and in the defence of colonial possessions.
AIVIVEX IVStatement by Admiral the Marquis de Magaz, Spanish Naval Representative, on the  subject  of the      extension of the Washington Naval Treaty to non-signatory Powers Members  of the League      of Nations.    The short period given us to consider the three schemes which have been brought forward with regard to this problem has not been such as to allow of this question being fully considered in official circles.  I have therefore received no instructions from my Government and I am alsowithout information as to  the opinion of  the Naval Staff. The following remarks are therefor of a purely personal nature.    The scheme submitted to the great Naval  Powers &quot;at Washington was freely discussed bythem.  They came to an agreement on some of the proposals laid before them after having made certain changes in them, but they also rejected  many others.    It is therefore advisable to make use of the same methods when we proceed to the extensionof the Treaty, since a scheme can only have any value if it has been freely discussed and generally accepted; it will be contrary to  the sentiments of independence and national  dignity to impose a Treaty wholly prepared  and ready  to be signed on the Governments.    It might perhaps have been preferable merely to invite certain Powers to adhere to the Washing-ton Treaty without giving any figures, but since expert technical opinion of the Permanent Advi-sory Commission  on the three schemes submitted has been asked for, and as all of them containfigures, it is impossible not to mention this subject.    The Washington Treaty was one concluded by  States which had  attained the  zenith oftheir naval  power.  But, on the contrary, the States to which  it is now desired  to  extend theTreaty are,  for the  most part, very far from having reached such  a position,  and some of the mare even only commencing their naval development.  It would not, therefore, be  just to basethe extension of the Treaty on the forces  at present possessed by the  second-class Powers; it seven possible that, if this were the procedure adopted, most of them would not accept an invitation to discuss the scheme.    On the other hand, there is so  much  difference, between the armaments of the  WashingtonSignatory Powers and those of other  Powers, that the former are in no clanger if they lay downlimits for the others which will  certainly  not be reached.    When fixing such figures we  may take it for granted that the armaments allowed at Washing-ton are the  minimum compatible with the national safety of the Signatory Powers, and estimatethose of other Powers by means of comparisons derived from a study of  the provisions of Article 8of the Covenant.    Let us  consider the case of Spain as an example of  the method to be followed.    At present Spain  has  no intention of building capital ships as defined by the washington treaty.  It is therefore almost certain, in  view of the short duration of the said Treaty and theslow progress of  shipbuilding in our  country, that she will not exceed the maximum tonnagefixed  for her by the most  restricted of the preliminary drafts submitted.    She cannot,  however,  enter into  engagements for the future  which, being contrary  to theCovenant of the League of Nations, would fix a limit for  her naval power proportionately more restricted than that which the five  Powers which signed the Washington Treaty freely grantedto themselves.    In a general way Spain&apos;s requirements are, from a geographical point of view, identical withthose of Italy;.in fact, both are  peninsulas having coasts  on two seas, several islands, Protecto-rates on the north coast of Africa and several more distant colonies (in  the case of Italy Erythreaand in the case of Spain Spanish Guinea and Rio de Oro).  We must obviously  take other circum-stances into consideration, but,  from a geographical  point of view, the only  one which  should exercise a deciding  influence on  the composition of a nation&apos;s fleet is  the consideration of whatthat nation considers necessary for its national safety and compatible with its  economic strength,that is to ,say, with funds  that it is able to devote to the realisation of its ideal.              *    The case of  Spain from this point of view is absolutely clear.                          *    The law of May 31st,  1907, which laid the  foundations of  Spain&apos;s naval renaissance, statedin its 19th paragraph:              &quot;This first programme for naval re-building is fixed  at three ships of about 15,000         tons, not because this number was regarded as sufficient but because  it has merely been         taken  as the  departure point for the future development of the fleet;&quot;
 and in paragraph 22:              &quot;It is expected that in a few years the nation will be able to maintain a fleet of nine         battleships with the necessary auxiliary ships.&quot;     It is also stated that the  naval programmes would be brought  forward successively  every seven to eight years.     It was with this idea that in June 1913 the second stage of naval development, which was chiefly to consist of three units of 21,000 tons, was entered upon.  This programme was published in the Gaceta de Madrid (Official Journal).     Parliament made  no difficulty about granting the necessary credits, but unfortunately the European War prevented the programme from being carried out.  It was therefore decided in 1915 to devote the sums voted by Parliament to the improvement of naval bases, for the con- struction  of submarines,  etc.     Had the War not  occurred, we should now have six capital ships and, further, the third pro- gramme, which, like the first two, was to include three capital ships,  would be under construction.     These forces are so necessary to us that at present we have the greatest difficulty in providing for our most urgent needs, although we keep several ships in commission which, in view of their age, should long  ago have been struck off the navy list.     If we compare the proportion of their general budget that the Maritime Powers  devote to their navies with that of Spain, it will easily be seen that we have the necessary economic resources for the upkeep of such a fleet.     If, therefore, we are to. remain faithful to the method followed at  Washington and the  spirit of the Covenant, we cannot go farther, when we  renounce our intention of developing our  naval power, than the following limits: the suppression of units more than twenty years old  at present in our possession, and  the abandonment of the third naval programme which should  have  been at present under construction; but we must regard the second programme as carried out, thus bringing  into our tonnage in capital ships the  three Espana  and the three  21,000-ton battle- ships provided for in the 1913 programme, or a total base tonnage  of about  108,000 tons, which might be reduced to 105,000 tons to get a multiple of 35,000.     The proportion between the tonnage of aircraft carriers to capital ships in the Washington Treaty is about  one-third in the case of France  and Italy.  Following this rule, the maximumfor Spain should be fixed at 35,000 tons. It might even be reduced to 33,000, which would be the tonnage for an experimental unit.     The  reasons  brought forward to justify certain exceptions in the case of France and  Italyalso  fully apply to Spain, since its naval construction was interrupted during the War to the  same degree as  those Powers,  and even  to a greater degree.     For these reasons  we beg to submit the following draft  Resolutions:-              1. The Naval Sub-Commission considers  that there is no necessity  to  modify the        Washington Treaty for the  purpose of  extending  it  to other  Powers;  it is  only        necessary to consider the maximum tonnage which each  State should possess and  what        exception should be made.             2. The Sub-Commission considers that it would not be equitable to base a maximum        limit of tonnage on the existing forces of Non-Signatory Powers, in view of the.&apos;fact that        the  fleets of  many of these  Powers are considerably below  the requirements of  their        national security.             3. The Sub-Commission can draw  up  figures of  the  tonnage  necessary for  each        State, based on a comparison of the geographical  and general situation of the Powers        signatory and  non-signa-tory to the Washington Treaty.             4. Such figures, however, can only have a provisional  value and serve as a basis        of discussion.Statement by Rear-Admiral Penido, Brazilian Naval Representative,  on the subject of the extension of   the Washington Naval Treaty to Non-Signatory Powers Members  of the League of Nations.      The short time at our disposal for the examination of the drafts submitted by the represen-tatives of three countries signatory to  the Washington Treaty, as the basis of a Convention forthe application of the principles of the said  Treaty to the States Members of the  League ofNations, as well as the fact that I am placed at a considerable distance from the Brazilian Admi-alty,  will explain why I am not able to furnish the Sub-Commission with my Governmentsopinion on this subject,which is so important for the naval power of my country.   I hope, how-ever, to be able to do so,  perhaps before the Third Assembly in September.      I can assure the Sub-Commission, however,jthat all steps and proposals  concerned with world peace are always  favourably  received in Brazil.      My country&apos;s policy towards  her neighbours has  always been  one of the most absoluteloyalty  and  disinterestedness.  Brazil has never  entered into a conflict except when driven toit by the provocation or intolerance of an adversary.  The action of her military forces hasalwaysbeen directed against men and not against nations.
     Brazil was the first country to protest against the invasion of Belgium,  and her people were so sympathetic to the cause of the Allies that Brazil ranged herself on the side of the defendersof the principles of civilisation in spite of Brazil&apos;s commercial interests and of the consequences which her attitude might entail.    Great causes have always been favourably received in Brazil.    The constitution of Brazil has established arbitration as an obligatory solution  in questionsinvolving international disputes and by this method disputes with ten of BraziTs neighbours on questions concerning frontiers have been settled in the broadest possible spirit.      In view of such considerations, I can state that Brazil has no idea of aggression in the ques-tion of the organisation of her naval power.      In one of his recent speeches  to the armed forces in my country, President Pessoa said:&quot;There is no thought of hostility in the international policy of Brazil.   Peace is now our greatestally and will continue to be so in the future, but no people can answer except for itself on questions connected with ideas,  national  passions and  tendencies of thought.  It cannot know to what extent other peoples entertain feelings of humanity  and civilisation.  This is the  cause of thepresent state of unhappy uncertainty,  and the present need of maintaining and keeping equippedmilitary forces.   This will last until such time as the peoples understand the necessity of defi-nitely abandoning violent procedure in the settlement of their  quarrels and of trusting to inter-national justice, just as in civil life private individuals trust to the justice of the law.&quot;      My country&apos;s policy being defined in this way, I can, without difficulty, and with the great-est sincerity submit to you  in my personal  and professional capacity  the  observations which seem to me to be reasonable  on the subject of the drafts which have been presented  for pur tech-nical consideration.      M. Rivas-Vicuna, who represents Chile on the Temporary Mixed Commission, made certainobservations, of which you are all cognisant,  on the subject of the application of the principlesof the Washington Treaty to the South American countries.      I also think that the co-efficients proposed in the various drafts  do  not  make sufficientallowance for the importance, the  necessities and the actual situation of Brazil, where conditionsdiffer essentially from those of European nations.      In view of the immense  extent  of her  coastline, the organisation of her naval power, inaccordance  with the general evolution of material in other navies, has a vital  interest for herexistence and for her internal needs.      In his last message to Parliament, the President of the Republic said:  &quot;Practically allthe units of our existing fleet have reached the maximum limit of their existence.&quot;      The cruisers Floriano and Deodoro, of 3,162 tons, constructed in 1895, are considered useless,and will have to be replaced by other more powerful units.      The Minas Geraes and  the Sao Paulo, constructed in 1908, have already passed the halfwaymark of the limits established for the  useful life of a war vessel.      Brazil, which has so large a coastline and an area of more than 8 million square kilometres,does not possess a single capital ship constructed according to the improvements  introduced  as aresult of the Great War.   How then  can a ten year truce  be imposed upon her, which  would prevent her from replacing  her old vessels and from completing her naval programme?   Theprogramme submitted in 1908 provides for the construction of a cruiser of  28,000  tons.   SinceBrazil&apos;s lines of communication with  eighteen of her States are almost exclusively  maritime, inview of the imperfect character of the communications in the interior, her Navy must be equippedin  such a way as to defend  her seaborne commerce  and her  lines of communication, which, as you well know, are the essence of strategy.      The situation of Brazil is therefore  very different from that of the Great Powers,  whichhave been forced to increase, improve and equip their navies in view of the  Great War.  Thisnecessity became so burdensome for  their budgets that their statesmen were obliged to adopta solution which has benefited their own internal economy, the peace of the world, and the inte-rests  of humanity at large.      You are  well aware of the fact  that it is precisely for such reasons as I have indicated toyou that Article 8 of the Covenant provides m one of its paragraphs as follows:             &quot;The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peace requires the         reduction of  national  armaments to the  lowest point consistent with national safety         and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.&quot;      Pending  the instructions of my Government, and pending submission  to you of its viewson the subject before you, I feel sure that you will consider the observations which I have justsubmitted  in a personal capacity with  your usual spirit of wisdom and tolerance.    During the fourth meeting of the Naval Sub-Commission, Admiral PENIDO requested that thefollowing summary of the reasons which had prompted him to make the  above  declarationsshould be attached to the Commisson&apos;s Report to the Council:             &quot;Whereas the situation of  the States signatory  to the Washington Treaty, is,        as I have explained  in the  observations on the case of Brazil which I have submitted        to the Sub-Commission, altogether  different  from that of the South American States;
    &quot;And whereas the Representatives of the Signatory Powers who were  with theexception of Japan - authors of the various draft schemes submitted to the Sub-Com-mission have rejected the proposal which Admiral MAGAZ artd I submitted to the Sub-Commission, which proposal was to establish, as the basis of  discussion, the principlescontained in Article 8 of the Covenant concerning the requirements of national security,geographical  situation, and international obligations;    &quot;And whereas, as  an expert of the League of Nations, I cannot depart from theorganic principles of the existence of the League, I abstain from participation in the drawing up of the Draft Convention, which  Convention is not compatible with the-requirements and with the naval defence of my country.&quot;
ANNEX V                DRAFT  CONVENTION     for the  Extension  of the Washington Naval treaty to  the  Non-Signatory   Powers of  the  League  of  Nations.

The total capital ship replacement tonnage of each of the following High Contract-ing Parties shall not exceed in standard displacement for  Argentine 81,000 tons  (82,290 metric tons);  for  Brazil 45,000 tons (45,714  metric  tons); for Chile 35,000 tons  (35,560  metric, tons);for Denmark 13,000 tons  (13,206 metric tons); for Greece 36,000 tons (36,571 metric tons); forNetherlands 26,000 tons  (26,412 metric  tons); for Norway 16,000 tons (16,254 metric tons); forSpain 81,000 tons (82,290 metric tons);  for Sweden 62,000 tons (62,984 metric tons).        Note.   Article 4 has been drafted in strict accordance with the principlesof the status     quo Nevertheless, the majority of the Members of the  Naval Sub-Commission feel bound to     call the attention of the Council  to the  resulting inequality  between the  respective naval     forces of the three South  American States: Argentine, Brazil and Chile, whereas, from a     technical  and general consideration of  the circumstances of these States, they consider that     they should logically have equivalent naval forces, the total tonnage in capital ships remain-     ing, however, below 80,000.     Article 5. - No capital ship exceeding 35,000 tons (35,560 metric tons) standard displacementshall be acquired by, or constructed by, for, or within the jurisdiction of, any of the High Contract-ing Parties.
    Article 6.   No capital ship of any of the High Contracting Parties shall carry a gun witha calibre in excess of sixteen inches (406 millimetres).    Article 7.   The High Contracting Parties may not construct aircraft carriers except within atotal tonnage limit equal to one-third of their total tonnage in capital ships.    Article 8.

No aircraft carrier exceeding 27,000  tons (27,432 metric tons) standard displace-ment  shall be acquired by, or constructed by, for, or within the jurisdiction of any of the HighContracting Parties.    Article 10.   No aircraft carrier of any of the High Contracting Parties shall carry a gun witha calibre in excess of 8 inches  (203 millimetres).  If the armament carried includes guns exceedingsix inches (152 millimetres) in calibre the total number of guns carried, except anti-aircraft gunsand guns  not. exceeding 5 inches (127  millimetres),  shall not exceed ten.   If  alternatively the armament contains no guns exceeding six inches (152 millimetres) in calibre, the number of gunsis not limited.    In either  case the number of anti-aircraft guns and of guns not exceeding 5  inches (127 milli-metres) in calibre is not limited.    Article 11.   No vessel of war exceeding 10,000  tons (10,160 metric tons) standard displace-ment, other than a  capital ship or aircraft carrier,  shall be acquired by, or constructed by, for,  or within the jurisdiction  of any of the High Contracting  Parties.    Vessels not  specifically built as fighting ships nor taken in time of peace under. government control for fighting  purposes, which are  employed on fleet duties or as troop transports or in someother way for the purpose of assisting in the prosecution of hostilities otherwise than as  fighting hips, shall not be within the limitations of this article.    Article 12.   No vessel of war of any of the High Contracting Parties hereafter laid down,other than a capital ship, shall carry a gun with a calibre in excess of eight inches  (203 millimetres)    Article 13.

Article 15.   No vessel of war constructed within the jurisdiction of any of the High Contract-ing Parties for a non-contracting Pai^ shall exceed the limitations as to displacement and arma-ment prescribed by the present Convention for vessels of a similar type which may be constructedby or for  any of the High Contracting. Parties.    Article  16.   If the construction of any vessel of war for a non-contracting Party is under-taken within the jurisdiction  of any of the High Contracting Parties, such Party shall promptlyinform the Council of  the League of Nations of the  date of the signing of the  contract  and thedate  on which the keel of the ship is laid; and shall  also communicate to the Council  the parti-circulars relating to the ship prescribed in Chapter II, Part 2 (b), 4 and 5, of the present Convention.    Article  17.   In the event of a High Contracting Party being engaged in war, such partyshall  not  use  as a vessel of war  any vessel  of war which may  be under construction within itsjurisdiction for  any other Power or which may have been constructed within its jurisdiction for another Power and not delivered.    Article 18.   Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not  to dispose by gift, Sole,  orany mode of transfer of any vessel of war in such  a manner that such vessel may become a vessel of war in  the Navy  of any foreign Power.

Replacement.    The replacement of capital ships and aircraft carriers shall take place according to  the fol-lowing rules:    (a)  Capital ships and aircraft carriers twenty years after the date of their completion may bereplaced by new construction, but within  the limits  prescribed  in Article 4  and Article  7.    The keels of such new construction may be laid down not earlier than seventeen years fromthe date of completion of the tonnage to be  replaced, provided, however, that no capital  shiptonnage shall be laid down until ten years from November 12th, 1921.
- 8i -    (b) Each of the High Contracting Parties shall communicate promptly to the Council of theLeague of Nations the following information:             i.  The names of the capital ships and  aircraft carriers to be replaced by new con-         struction;             2.  The date of governmental authorisation of replacement tonnage;             3.  The date of laying the keels of  replacement tonnage;             4.  The standard displacement in tons and metric tons of each new ship to be laid         down, and  the  principal dimensions namely, length at waterline, extreme beam  at or         below waterline, mean draft at standard displacement;             5. The date of completion of each new ship and its standard displacement  in tons         and metric tons, and the principal dimensions, namely, length at waterline,  extreme         beam at or below waterline, mean draft at standard displacement, at time of completion.    (c) In  case of loss or accidental  destruction of capital ships or aircraft carriers, they mayimmediately be replaced  by new construction subject to the tonnage limits prescribed in Articles4  and 7 and in conformity  with the other provisions of the present Convention, the  regularreplacement programme  being deemed to  be advanced to that  extent.    In the event of the replacement of a capital ship or aircraft carrier under this clause, the total tonnage possessed shall be kept within the limits laid  down for replacement in Articles 4 and 7by the scrapping, in accordance with the terms of Chapter II, Part 3, of such old vessels as maybe necessary.    (d) No capital ship or aircraft carrier shall be reconstructed except for the purpose of providingmeans of defence against air and submarine attack, and subject  to the following rules: The  HighContracting Parties may, for that purpose, equip existing tonnage with bulge or blister or anti-air attack deck protection, provided the increase of displacement thus effected does not exceed 15 %of the original displacement for each ship.  No alteration in side armour, in calibre, number or general type of mounting of main armament shall be permitted.                                          PART  3.                          Rules for the Disposal  of Ships  Replaced.    The following rules shall be observed for the scrapping of capital ships and aircraft carrierswhich are  to be  disposed of when replaced by new construction in  accordance with Articles 3and 8.    I. A vessel to be scrapped must be placed in such condition that it cannot be put to combatantuse.    II.   This result must be finally effected  in any  one of the following ways:    (a) Permanent sinking of the vessel.    (b) Breaking the vessel up.   This shall  always involve the destruction or removal of all ma-chinery, boilers and armour, and all deck,  side and bottom plating.    (c) Converting the vessel to target use  exclusively.  In such case all  the provisions of para-graph III of this part, except sub-paragraph (6), in so far as may be necessary to enable the ship to be used as a mobile target, and except sub-paragraph (7), must be previously complied with.Not more than one capital ship may be retained for this purpose at one time by any of the HighContracting Parties.    III.   (a) When a vessel is due for scrapping, the first  stage of scrapping,  which consists of rendering a ship incapable of further warlike service, shall be immediately undertaken.    (6) A vessel  shall be  considered incapable of further warlike service when there shall havebeen  removed and landed, or also destroyed in the ship:             (1) All guns and essential portions of guns, fire-control tops and revolving  parts                   of all barbettes and turrets;             (2) All machinery  for working hydraulic or electric mountings;             (3) All fire-control  instruments and  range  finders;             (4) All ammunition, explosives and. mines ;             (5) AH torpedoes,  war heads  and torpedo tubes;             (6) All wireless telegraphy installations;             (7) The conning tower  and all side  armour,  or alternatively all main propelling                   machinery;  and             (8) All landing and flying-off platforms and all other aviation accessories.    IV. -  The periods in which scrapping  of vessels is to be effected are as follows:     (a) The work of rendering the vessel incapable of further warlike service in accordance  with paragraph III of this part shall be commenced not later than the date of completion of its successor,and shall be finished within six  months from the  date of such completion.    (6) The vessel shall be finally scrapped, in  accordance with paragraph II of this part, withineighteen months from  the date of completion of its successors.  If, however, the completion of thenew vessel shall be delayed, then the work of rendering the old vessel incapable of further warlike
service  in  accordance with paragraph  III of this part shall  be commenced within  four years from the laying of the keel of the new vessel, and shall be finished within six months from the&apos; date on which such work was commenced, and the old vessel shall be finally scrapped in accordancewith paragraph II of this part within eighteen months from the date when the work of rendering-it incapable of further warlike service was commenced.                                           PART 4.                                         Definitions.    For the purpose  of the present convention the  following expressions are to be understoodin the sense defined in this part.Capital Ship.    A capital  ship, in the case of ships hereafter built,  is defined as a vessel of war, not an air-craft carrier, whose displacement exceeds 10,000 tons (10,160 metric tons) standard displacementor which carries a gun with a calibre exceeding 8 inches (203  millimetres) .Aircraft Carrier.    An aircraft carrier is defined as a vessel of war with a displacement in excess of 10,000 tons(10,160 metric tons)  standard  displacement  designed for the  specific  and exclusive purpose ofcarrying aircraft.  It must be so constructed that aircraft can be launched  therefrom and landedthereon, and not designed and constructed for carrying a more  powerful armament than thatallowed to it under Article 11.Standard Displacement.    The standard displacement of a ship is the displacement of the ship complete, fully manned,engined, and equipped ready for sea, including all armament and ammunition, equipment, outfit,provisions and fresh water for crew,  miscellaneous stores  and  implements of every description thatare intended to be carried in war, but without fuel or  reserve  feed water on board.    The word &quot;ton&quot;  in the present Convention, except  in the expression &quot;metric tons&quot; shall be understood to  mean the ton of 2,240 pounds (1,016 kilog).    Vessels now  completed  shall  retain their present ratings of  displacement tonnage inaccordance with their national system of measurement.   However, a Power expressing displace-ment in metric tons shall  be considered for the application of  the present  Convention as owningonly the equivalent displacement in tons of 2,240 pounds.   : A vessel completed hereafter shall be rated at its displacement tonnage when in  the standardcondition defined herein.CHAPTER  III.                                MISCELLANEOUS  PROVISIONS.    Article 20.   If during the term of the present Convention the requirements of the national security of any High Contracting Party in respect of naval defence are, in the opinion of that party, materially  affected by any change of  circumstances, this opinion shall be communicatedto the Council of the League of Nations, who will call a conference of the High Contracting Partiesor take such other action as may be necessary for the reconsideration of the provisions of thisConvention and its amendment by mutual agreement.    In view of possible technical  and scientific developments and of the wording  of Article 8 ofthe Covenant, which states that plans for reduction of armaments shall be subject to reconside-ration and revision at least every ten years, the Council of the League of Nations will arrange fora conference of all the High Contracting Parties which shall meet as  soon as possible after theexpiration of eight years from the coming into force of the present Convention to  consider what changes, if any, in the Convention may be necessary to meet such developments.    Article 21.   Whenever any High Contracting Party shall become engaged in  a war without having violated in any way its obligations as prescribed in the Covenant of the League of Nations,which in its opinion affects the naval defence of its national security, such Party may, after notice to the Council of the League, suspend for the  period of hostilities its obligations under the presentConvention, other than those under Articles 13 and 17 provided that such Party shall notify theCouncil of the League that the emergency is of such a character as to require such suspension.

Budget Expenditure  on  National  Defence,               1913  and  19201922.INTRODUCTION    At the meeting of the Temporary Mixed Commission held in Paris in July 1922, it was proposed by Mr.Lebrun to submit to the Assembly, in the form of clear statistical tables, information with regard to expenditureon account of National Defence before and since the war.  This proposal was adopted by the Commission, and inthe present memorandum the following 21 countries, for which the necessary information has  been obtained,are reviewed:      Australia      Belgium      Brazil      British India      Canada      Czechoslovakia      Denmark    In the cases of Belgium, Brazil and Roumania, the information has been received from  correspondents,and in other cases has been collected exclusively  from official sources   Closed Accounts, Budget Estimates,Official Year-Books, etc.THE  SIGNIFICANCE OF THE  FIGURES.Finland                       PortugalFrance                        RoumaniaItaly                          South AfricaJapan                        SpainNetherlands                    SwedenNew Zealand                   SwitzerlandNorway                       United Kingdom    Before proceeding to a discussion of the tables, some general remarks must be made on the significance of.the figures presented.  It is a well-known fact that the accounting systems of various countries differ widely, andthat, therefore, extreme care must be exercised when budget figures of different countries are compared.   In thecourse of the work on the present memorandum it has been found that important differences exist even withregard to the Army and Navy Budgets, among which the following may be noted particularly:    1. Some countries account for gross appropriations, that is, all money expenditure by the Naval and MilitaryDepartments is shown in the Budget;  while other countries only include net appropriations, that is, expenditure.
 after deduction of various receipts, such as proceeds from sale of old material, repayments from other Government Departments, contributions from Colonies or Local Governments and sometimes even the yield of special taxes. The difference between gross and net appropriations is by no means negligible.  It amounts to no less than   15,000,000 in the Army Budget for the United Kingdom for the financial year 1922-23.     2.  Some countries account  for military and naval establishments (powder factories,  dockyards,  etc.)  in the Budgets of the Army and  Navy Departments, while others  account for them as independent State under- takings.                           .                                       ...     3.  The  respective functions  undertaken  by  th? Army and Navy Departments  are not  the same  in various countries.  For example,  it is very frequently the case that the Navy Department administers certain services for civil purposes.  On  the other hand,  there is great  variation in practice with regard to the extent to which Civil Services perform functions of a military character.     4.  With regard to expenditure for non-effective services (pension charges, etc.),  great differences of method exist.   Pensions to persons mutilated in the war (so-called war pensions) are regularly excluded from the Army and Navy Budgets.    But with regard to other pensions, some States carry them to the Public Debt, others charge them to special Ministries of Pensions or to Departments of Finance; others, again, include them in the appropria- tions for the Department of War or of the Marine.     5.  In addition to  these and other  &quot;normal&quot; differences, there are exceptional factors of disturbance  in the post-war period, as the methods employed  for the accounting of &quot;war charges&quot; differ fundamentally. Some countries,  for  instance,   have  included  all  demobilisation  expenses,  cost of  repatriation,  demobilisation gratuities,  and  outlay  for the  civil  re-establishment of soldiers, in the Army and Navy  Budgets,  while  in other countries the  same kind of expenditure is accounted for  in civil budgets.     It has not been possible within the time available to recast the  Defence Budgets according to a standard system  in order to render them comparable.   Such recasting would,  in fact, necessitate a very minute  and protracted study, and it has only been possible to follow the system adopted by each individual country.  This. being the  case, the fact must be emphasised that the figures for Defence Expenditure presented in this memorandum do not admit of comparison between the figures for one country and those for others.    The Commission  has decided that the work now begun should  be continued and developed, and it is hoped at a later date to present, for the various countries, figures which are comparable.    The intention of  the Commission in presenting this preliminary memorandum has been to  furnish material indicating the development and tendency in each individual country.  In view of the importance attached to this matter by both the First  and the  Second Assembly from the point of view of  disarmament, as well as by the International Financial Conference of Brussels  from the point of  view of the financial situation of the world, a study of the  variations to be observed in Defence Expenditure during the past three years as compared with pre-war figures would appear to present special  interest.    After a detailed study of the material collected in the short time at its disposal, the Sub-Commission wishes to draw the  attention of the Commission to the following points:    (a) That, on the whole, the estimated Defence Expenditure for the financial year 1922 (or 1922-23) seemsto show a reduction as compared with the actual expenditure incurred in the two previous financial years.    (b) That, in appreciating the significance of this reduction, however, due consideration must be given tothe fact that  since the year 1920, in many of the countries concerned, there has been  a falling off in war chargesowing to the operations connected with demobilisation and also to the fact that in many countries there has beena considerable decrease in  prices.SCOPE  AND  FORM  OF THE TABLES.    It has been decided to present the review in the form of three tables for each country.    The first of these tables makes a comparison  between the Defence Expenditure in 1913 and that of thefinancial years  1920, 1921  and 1922.   In the column headed &quot; Expenditure Index &quot;., index figures have been calculated for post-war years, pre-war Defence Expenditure being taken as 100, and these figures are comparedwith the index numbers of wholesale prices and with an index showing the percentage cost of the U. S. A. dollar.
    In the second table the Defence Expenditure for the financial year 1922 has been reduced to pre-war price level by reference to the wholesale price index for the same year.   The figures thus obtained are then comparedwith the expenditure for 1913.  The  expenditure in 1922 has also been reduced to gold basis  and  similarlycompared.^  It must, however, be remembered that gold has lost at least one-third of its purchasing power andthat, therefore, 100 gold francs in 1913, for instance, correspond to at least 150 gold francs at the present time.    The third table shows the relative importance, as compared with Total Budget  Expenditure,  of defence expenditure and  also of that expenditure less  charges resulting  from the war and from international obliga-tions.  The amount of these  charges  has  not been available for all countries.   Their character is  naturallyvague, and appreciable differences exist, as between different countries, with regard to their scope.  The nature and extent of the deductions have in most cases been indicated in footnotes.    It is noticeable from this comparison that  the relative  importance of the Defence Budgets to  the totalBudget Expenditure has diminished from 1913 to 1922 in almost all countries.  It is,  however,  important tostate that this diminution is due not so much to a decrease in the military and naval expenditure as  to  heavynew charges on the National Budgets, especially for Debt Service.

Marks, consisted of the Finnish contribution towards Russian military    expenditure in lieu of personal service.c)   These figures do not cover the total costs, as special increases in officers&apos; salaries, etc., on account of the high cost of living,    are charged to the general budget, together with those to civil officials, in one aggregate sum.  It has been estimated that    for 1922 the increases in military salaries will amount to approximately 25 million F. marks, and that they amounted to    somewhat less during the preceding years.(d)  As general index numbers of wholesale prices are not calculated for Finland, the index numbers of the cost of living have    been substituted.  That these index numbers clearly reflect the movement of wholesale prices can be seen from a comparison    with the indices calculated for import and export prices.

Gross rather thannet appropriations have been quoted, and the expenditure shown in the table, therefore, contains:               War Charges even when covered by sales of surplus war stores,               Middle East Expenditure on account of Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordania (refunded by the Colonial Office),               Armies of Occupation on  the Rhine and in plebiscite areas,  and  also  expenditure which is covered by                     contributions from the Colonies, the Dominions and India.The opening paragraph of the White Paper from which the figures are taken describes the connection between Gross and net Appropriations as follows:        .                                                                         V             &quot;Departmental expenditure  (other than Consolidated Fund charges  under  Statute)- is  met  from  two  main        sources: (1) supply grants,  (2)  receipts appropriated in  aid.  Both  supply grants and appropriations  in  aid are        authorised by Parliament each  year,  but  circumstances  tend to concentrate attention mainly  oh ^supply grants&apos;;        that  is to say, on the  net  estimates  of the  year.  In  order to  measure the actual total expenditure  of Public        Departments, the more significant figures  are the gross estimates,  i.  e., the total of supply grants and  appropria-        tions in aid combined, as  these  figures represent the  total cash sums placed by Parliament at  the disposal of        Departments.  A  certain  amount of duplication  is  involved by inter-departmental payments, principally for the        cost  of production by the Ordnance Factories  for the Fighting Departments, and payments to Army and Air Votes        from the Middle East  Vote.&quot;It should be noted that the expenditure includes costs of non-effective Services (half-pay, pensions, etc.)..-&apos;The Air Force Expenditure includes the following votes for Civil Aviation and Experimental and Research Services:1(c)                                          Civil Aviation.                                                                                 1920  .  .  288,000                                  1921  .  .  898,000                                  1922  .  .  411,000The personnel of the Army,-Navy and Air Force was as follows:     .
