                        U R G, g N T t                                      AIMIRALTYj  S.W.1,Ref: Ho: M./T.D.9536.                           1st October, 1922,  Sir,       I am commanded by My lord Commi.&amp;si^^r.e^r^of&quot; the Admiralty to state that They propose that the list of Contraband which was in force prior to the Armistice with Turkey should again be put in force in the event of a resumption of hostilities- ties with Turkey. 2,    The list of Contraband is contained in the Proclamation dated  2nd July, 1917,.   It is a list that was generally known, and has also recently been used by the Greeks, 3.    Under Maritime,Law the right of visit and search for contraband can be exercised anywhere, and it was further declared, under the Maritime Rights Order in Council, 1916, that the principle of continuous voyage br ultimate destination shall be applicable in cases of contraband.   The exercise of this right universally might, however, be-considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government vexatious and liable to bring  Other Powers into hostility. The alternative is to carry on visit  and search only in the vicinity of the enemy ooast, aay in the Eastern Mediterranean dnd the Aegean, 4,    I am to request that  this question of policy may be at once considered by the Cabinet so that immediate s.ction can be taken should we be involved in hostilities as  regards (a) the issue of a proclamation as to what is contraband, (b) the issue of Instructions to Commanders in Chief and Senior Laval Officers as to the action to be taken. 5,    It will be for consideration whether the      * policy decided on as regards visit and search at sea need be applied to the action  of the Customs Collectors in the United Kingdom and other pa^ts of the British Empire in&quot;seizing or unloading contraband in ships actually present In the ports of the British Empire,I am,   . Sir,        Your obedient Servant,   (Signed)    ALEX.  FLINT.Phe Secretary, Offices of the Cabinet.
