Fallowing from Lord Balf our for Cabinet,-    Dominion Delegation feel that they are not being kept sufficiently informed about events In the Near Eastand His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attitude.   They would .appreciate shor^ daily summary if possible.ParaphraseTelegram&apos; from Mr,. Churchill to Lord Balfour; Geneva,    Sent 22nd September,. 1922,Secrete.  Personal *    As I understand that the Dominion delegates at Genevaare complaining that  they are not sufficiently informed aboutTurkish crisis, I think that the best method will be for ust*- keep you fully Informed each day and for you to make this information available to the Dominion delegations.-The fact that Steel Maitland and Robert Cec&apos;1 are membersof these Delegations  should be borne in mind as It is not                                       desirable/No,  2M
desirable that cur confidential information should, beplaced at the disposal of. those who may wish simply to criticise the Government.   You will perhaps think it right to ascertain from these two whether they would prefernot to see telegrams knowledge of which might hamper theirsubsequent freedom.;   If then they  ask to see vie,, we can safely trust to their discretion.    The Colonial Office representative at Geneva Mr., Dixonhas been instructed to report himself to you and, to beavailable for any secretarial work  which this distributionof information may involve,,   Please let me know whetherthis will be sufficient.    The communication of information to the Dominiondelegates should not at this stage  include the actual text of messages passing between their Prime Minister and theBritish Prime&apos; Minister.   The Dominion Prime ministers have hitherto been particular upon  this point.   I havenot yet received an answer to enquiries I have made of them on this point.
