[This Document is the Property  of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                     (Printed for the Cabinet.     October 1922.)SECRET. CP. 4-263. ,                                   CABINET.     I circulate for the  information of my colleagues the  following telegram received.from India regarding the state  of feeling there due to  the critical situation  in the Near East,     6th October 1.922.                                                 PEEL. From Viceroy, Home Department, to Secretary of State for India, 3rd October 1922.    In view of the critical  situation at the present juncture in  the Near  East, weconsider it necessary to inform yon  of the state of Indian  feeling  on  this subject.What we have to say is largely a resume of previous communications, but we think itdesirable  that the position  in this  respect should  be clearly summarised  for yourinformation.    (1) Mohamedans  throughout India have been  profoundly stirred  and  muchpleased by the news of Kemalist victories.  The Khilafat agitation  has been on thewane for some time, its leaders are  suspected  of being the tools of Hindu politicians,subscriptions have practically ceased and its funds are very low.   But the enthusiasmfor the Angora Government in its struggle with the Greeks has  continued  unabated.Subscriptions  have all  along been forthcoming, and the Angora Fund has  actually aconsiderable balance in hand at the  moment.  The Kemalist  successes have therefore been received with great rejoicing.   In all provinces numerous meetings of celebrationhaA^e been held, mosques have been illuminated, and special prayers for  continuedsuccess of Turkish arms have been and are being offered.   In addition, an appeal hasbeen made in  the   .   .    .   Independent for the  formation of an. Angora  legion.We have taken steps to make the legal position in regard to this matter clear to thepublic,  and we should not, of course, permit Indians to leave India for the purpose of taking  service under  Angora&apos;s orders.  The issue of this appeal, however,  is a clear indication of Mohamedah feeling.   Although there have been a few violent speechesat meetings or in mosques, the manifestations have hitherto been marked by moderationand restraint, and apart  from the  intransigent  and  flamboyant utterances of a fewextremists,  the expectations entertained  have  not  been  extravagant.  Combined,however, with elation at the defeat of the  Greeks, there is a strong undercurrent ofanxiety in regard  to the attitude of Great Britain.  The efforts of the Government ofIndia in the matter of representingMohamedan views  and sentiments to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are recognised and  appreciated,  but the  general belief  is that the Greekoperations in Asia Minor were inspired by, and  have  throughout been dependent onEnglish support, and that while  France and Italy are  friendly to Turkish aspirations,the policy of Great Britain has been  the  one obstacle to a  settlement satisfactory toMohamedans.   We have done all that is possible to remove these misapprehensions,and to place policy of His Majesty;s  Government  in its true light,  but with little effect.It is now hoped, however, by Mohamedans, that the logic of  eveuts will  be recognised by Great Britain, and that Turks  will not  be  robbed  of legitimate  fruits of theirvictories by British opposition.   We have already communicated to  you our views asto terms which will satisfy moderate Mohamedan opinion.     If  however, unfortunately,  a  solution on these  lines  is not reached, and  war between British  and  Angora Governments  breaks out, the effect  on   Mohamedansthroughout India will be of a serious character and will materially affect for the worsethe whole political  situation.  The Mohamedan agitation during the last three years has undoubtedly been fanned by politicians  for their own purposes, but it  now rests on genuine religious feelings, especially in the  United  Provinces and in North-west frontier Province, which will be deeply stirred in the event of a conflict between theBritish and Turkish forces.     2.  As regards the  Hindus, the  position is more  complicated.  The  extremistelement welcome any blow  to British  prestige,  and  the  Remalist  victories  are      5780   100  10.22
regarded as such by them.  There is, however, no  real desire  on the part of the hindus generally for the aggrandisement or  strengthening  of Turkey,  with itsconsequent increase in Mohamedan power and influence ; and the non-co-operators inparticular are gravely exercised over the reaction  on their own. schemes which  asettlement  of  the Turkish question would undoubtedly involve.  This party realisesthat the fighting element in their campaign has been very largely furnished by theMohamedans ; and  they fear with  reason, that Mohamedan support will be lost if  a peace  satisfactory on the whole  to Mohamedans is concluded.  As we have beforeexplained, the Hindu-Mohamedan entente has been essentially a combination of partieswhose real aims were profoundly divergent.  It has never been more than skin deep,and friction between the two communities, despite desperate efforts by the politicians,as at Multan,  to  patch Lip differences, has  recently become too  acute to be  deniedeven  by the extremists.  The policy  of Hindu extremists,  therefore, is to inflameMohamedan feeling in the hope  that thereby any settlement, should any be reached,between the Allies and Kemalists will  be rendered unacceptable to Mohamedans, andthat Mohamedans will be  compelled in consequence to maintain  the  alliance  withthemselves.
