[This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1922.SECRET.CP 4270.                                 CABINET.          REPORT  OF THE  COMMITTEE  ON  EXPENDITURE                          (CIVIL  DEPARTMENTS).     WE were appointed by Cabinet Minute 5 (b) of Cabinet 34 (22) to consider the Draft Estimates of the Civil Services for the year 1923-24.     The Budget for that year is threatened by two dangers.  The charge in respect of our debt to United States may be very greatly increased., while the loss of anticipated revenue from the Excess Profits Duty is now assuming very large dimensions. While a  forecast of revenue framed so  far  in  advance  must necessarily be somewhat speculative, we  are informed that on present indications there  may be a  deficit of  60 millions to  65  millions in  1923-24 on the basis of existing taxation unless expenditure can be reduced by that amount.     Our task was to examine the Estimates for the  Civil Departments, the expendi- ture on the Fighting Services, including the Middle  East,  being referred to the Committee presided over by the Secretary of State for  the Colonies.     2 On the  16th June the Treasury issued a circular drawing attention to the position and calling on Departments to submit sketch Estimates of their expenditure in 1923-24.  The replies to that circular are set out in Appendix I to this report. The original Estimates  for the Civil Services (Ordinary Budget)  in 1922-23  were  320 millions and the replies from the Departments indicated reductions on 96 Votes amounting to  24^ millions  and increases on 22 Votes amounting to  10 millions, the net result being a  decrease of  14^ millions, or 4-5 per cent.     The charge  for War Pensions showed a decrease of  12 millions, if allowance is made for the revision of pension rates with the cost of living, to which reference is made in paragraph 5 below.  In respect of the bonus to Civil Servants, Departments were instructed to estimate on the basis of a cost of living of 85 points above the pre-war rate,  and the  sum  so calculated shows a reduction for  the  whole  Service of over  4 millions.   Irish Votes  show a  decline of nearly  2^ millions.  These largely automatic savings account for a great part of the  24^  millions of reductions.     Comparison is  made in all cases with the Original Estimates for 1922-23, now including, therefore,  the Supplementary Estimates put  forward last summer, and ) the increases of   10 millions are largely accounted for  by two decisions taken  after the Original Estimates for  1922-23  were framed, viz :          An  increased  charge  of   roughly   31   millions   in  respect  of  &apos;&apos; The             Unemployment  Insurance Act, 1922.&quot;         Expenditure  of nearly  3 millions  under  &quot; The Empire Settlement Act,             1922.&quot;    3. It immediately became apparent to us that the need for further retrenchment was imperative,  but the difficulty of carrying out detailed investigation over so wide a field by the full Committee was so serious  that we decided that the preliminary work should be undertaken by sub-committees.    Lord Crawford examined the Foreign and Colonial Estimates, as  well as the Police and certain other Home Office Votes.  In dealing with the Foreign and Colonial Estimates he was assisted by Sir John Baird.    Lord Peel assisted by Mr. Amery examined the Health Votes.    Sir  L. Worthington-Evans examined  the  War  Pensions  Vote  with the assistance of Commander Eyres Mbnsell, and  the Ministry of Labour Vote with the assistance of Major Tryon.    At our request  Mr. Hilton Young undertook the examination of the Education and Works Votes.    The remaining  Votes requiring examination were dealt with by  the Chancellor of the Exchequer assisted, as regards Agriculture, by Lord Gorell and, as regards the Post Office, by Sir Montague  Barlow.    We have considered in detail the Reports of the  different sub-committees, and as presented herewith  they  represent our unanimous recommendations.      [8965]                                                          B
     4. As shown in Appendix I,  the further savings recommended amount to  171- millions, making, with  the savings  of   141  millions shown in the sketch Estimates a total of  32 millions, or 10 per cent, of the sum included for these services in this year&apos;s Budget.     This result, we trust, will  be supported by the Cabinet.               1 &apos;1     The great efforts made in the current year to effect economies have in many cases rendered  our task more difficult.  Several Departments which  contrived to.,reduce their votes in 1922-23 by realising assets, utilising balances on funds, and reducing stores in hand have found it necessary to apply for increased grants in 1923-24.     We have in no case suggested a reduction in. a Vote without  specifying clearly in what direction, in  our opinion, the  actual economies can be carried out.     5. Our recommendations in the main do not affect policy.   We haVe not, for  j example, proposed any change  in the financial arrangements with Local Authorities, the question of the percentage grant system being under consideration by a Committee presided over by  Lord Meston.     One large issue of policy is the effect of  clause 24 a in  the Pensions Warrant of the 6th December, 1919, under which War Pensions fall to be reduced on the 1st April next by an amount proportionate to the fall in  the cost  of living between  1919  and 1922. The resultant saving would be  7 or  8 millions, and is included in the savings of  14-]? millions shown in the replies to the Treasury Circular.  It  therefore appears also in the aggregate  savings of  32 millions shown in paragraph  4 above.     We are of opinion  that this matter must be decided hy the Cabinet     We  call attention  to the  passage on  page  5 of our Report  on the Board of Education (E.(C.S.)5) indicating that the Board are in favour of salaries lower than those of the Burnham scales being paid to new  entrants to the teaching profession. Should an arrangement of this kind be adopted in the case of teachers we see very considerable advantages in extending it to new entrants in other Services.     In our Report on the Police Vote (E.(C.S.)4, Part, II. page 5). we have expressed our opinion that if the present position as to wages is substantially unchanged early next summer, a  revision of the scales laid down in the Desborough Report should then be taken in hand, and we consider that an examination of the question should be undertaken soon in order that proposals  may be ready for Cabinet consideration early in the new financial year     6. One point which emerges from our investigation may have a bearing on the enquiry BY the Committee presided over by the  Secretary of State  for the  Colonies. This relates to the excessive cost of the Metropolitan Police employed by Government Departments.  We are informed that recently  the  Office  of Works have replaced thirty-three policemen employed in Civil Departments by thirty-one night watchmen at a saving of  250 per annum for each policeman replaced.  Large numbers of the Metropolitan Police are employed in the dockyards and  arsenals.   We suggest  that a special ad hoc enquiry should be instituted at once into this question, as we believe large economies can be effected.     7. Wre are impressed with the value of  such enquiries as those which have been carried out by our sub-committees.  They have been concluded in good time for the full effect of the recommendations to  appear in the  annual estimates, and we are informed  that a very  large measure of agreement-has  been reached with the Depart- ments concerned.     While it cannot  be expected that every economy  will  be immediately accepted without question, we most strongly represent to the Cabinet that  our recommenda- tions throughout  are  safe and moderate, that the full savings  are  most  urgently required,  and that, in the event of objection  being taken by any  Department to  par- ticular economies, it is the primary duty of the  Department before asking for relief to investigate anew every branch of its activities with a  view7 to effecting equivalent;economies in other directions.     We have no  doubt  that a close scrutiny  of expenditure by the Treasury and by the Departments  when the ordinary estimates are in actual preparation will produce further economies, and the figures we have suggested for different  Votes should be regarded  as maxima capable of reduction.     8. Finally,  we have to observe  that  our  recommendations are based  on the assumption that every effort will be made to carry into law at  the earliest possible moment the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.   This is of vital importance to  the success of our  recommendations as regards Education and certain other services.                                     Signed on behalf of the Committee,                                                              R. S.  HORNE.     Treasury Chambers, October 11, 1922.

Mr.a&apos; letter  for 1923-4 it appears to us that the estimate of the24thist 1922.   expenditure  to be incurred on Oversea Settlement has been           framed by the Oversea Settlement Committee without any close           consultation with the Secretary of State and his immediate           advisers.                                                        The/- 7 ii.
      The schemes under the Empire &quot;Settlement Act 1922involve liabilities extending over a period of 15 years witha maximum expenditure of  3,000,000 in any one year.   TheSecretary of State i3 responsible to parliament for these schemes and the expenditure involved and we think it  is ofthe utmost importance that his interest, and that of  the accouting Officer for the Colonial Office Vote,  in theschemes should be immediate and personal.      In making this observation we have not had in mind,and we, of course, intend no criticism of the excellentarrangement&apos;  now prevailing whereby Colonel Amery, whowas until 1921 parliamentary Under Secretary of State forthe Colonies, has since continued, while holding the  post of parliamentary and financial Secretary to tho Admiralty,to bC responsible to the Secretary of State on all matters affecting Overseas Settlement.Subhead C.1.  Salaries of Overseas Settlement Office.      Since the provisional Estimate was framed arrarige-ments have been made which will result in reducing the costof this staff by  3,277.Subhead C.3.  Travelling and Incidental Expenses.      This subhead includes a sum df  2,500 for travelling expenses; we understand that this estimate is based onthe assumption that the Chairman of the Overseas Settle-men t Committee will have to vi3it two or three dominions in the year 1923-4.      We thifnk this estimate might safely be reduced by 500.Subhead C.3.  Eree passages.      We make no observations.Subhead G.4.  Grants to Voluntary Societies.

We recommend that any fresh grants made under this sub-head should be confined, so far as practicable,  tosocieties carrying out activities in connexion with JSmpireSettlement which w oil Id otherwise have to be carried out as a direct charge to Imperial Funds.Empire Settlement Actilm 1981.    n As sis fed passages.     The suggested provision of  1,200,000 for  Assistedpassages, subsequently reduced, to  1,100,000 is  arrived  aton the baBis of 52,000 persons migrating to Australia andHew Zealand (against 28,000 in the year ended 30th June1922) at a total cost to Imperial Funds of  685,985 and  of30,000 persons migrating to Canada at a total cost to imperial Funds of  389,250.      We think that having regard to the time which itwill take for Land Settlement Schemes, on which an increased&apos;flow of migration largely depends, to mature, it would besufficient to calculate on the basis of 40,000 migrantsproceeding to Australia and Hew Zealand in the year 1923-4.      The Canadian Government has not in the past adopted the Australian and Hew Zealand policy of offering reducedpassages to approved migrants from this country  and hasnot yet signified its ^desire to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;3Government in a scheme for Assisted passages..  The Chairmanof the Oversea Settlement Committee proposes to  visit Canadashortly for the. purpose of discussing the possibilities  ofco-operation under the Act, and we suggest that the pro-vision for Assisted passages, especially so far as that dominion is concerned, should be reviewed before theEstimates are closed.  Meanwhile we think that the totalprovision which will be required for Assisted Passages shouldbe assumed to be  800,000, which would allow for nearly21,000 migrants to Canada in addition to 40,000 toAustralia.-                                            Land/&apos;
La nd S e 111ement Schernes.The suggested provision of  1,500,000 is made up asfollows:-Victoria450,000,West Australia37,000487,000    say500,000Canada750,000Other parts of the Empire250,000     The Victoria Scheme is based  on the principle that  loans to settlers for the purchase, equipment and stocking of  theirholdings will be shared by the British and Victoria Govern-ments and recovered from the settlers over a period of 36years.      Under a scheme of this type the Exchequer will berequired to provide a large sum at the outset and will receiverepayment in small sums over a long period.      Under the Western Australia Scheme the whole of thecapital required by the scheme will be advanced by theDominion Government out of loans to be raised for the purpose and the British Government&apos;s contribution, which will be equivalent to l/ord of the&apos; interest for 5 years on the loansso raised, will represent its share of the estimated irre-coverable expenditure by the Dominion Government.      Under a scheme of this - type the call on the exchequer is relatively small and is moreover spread over a period  of5 or 6 years, but of course no part of the contribution  isrecoverable.      The provision of  450,000 included in the sketch estimate for the Victoria, scheme represents the BritishGovernment&apos;s contribution in 1923/4 to the co3t of settling1,500 farmers.  The provision of  37,000 for the West Australiascheme represents the British Government&apos;s contribution  in thatyear to the cost of settling 2,000 farmers.The/
     The striking difference in the immediate call on theExchequer under these two types of schemes will he apparentfrom these comparative figures..     We accordingly consider that&apos; so long as the financialposition Of this country remains serious, schemes should conform to the Western Australia type wherever possible, andthis should we think be possible when the Dominion Governmentis able to raise loans sufficient to provide for advances tosettlers and other capital purpose a, since repayments bysettlers would in a year or two cover the charges on loans raised to provide; advances to them.      We are informed, that it would, be very difficult atthis stage of the negotiations With the Victoria Governmentto propose a different basis of our contribution  in that case..  We consider., however, that the matter should bediscussed with that Government-.  The change would, not necessl-tate any alteration of the scheme itself, but merely thefinancial adjustments between the two Governments.      We feel considerable doubt whether the provision pro-posed for the Victoria scheme, as at present contemplated,will be required in the eomjfcng financial year,  A more reasonable estimate we think would be  300,000 (viz.: 1,000settlers at  300).      The sum proposed for Land Settlement in Canada seemsto us premature  having regard to the fact that no scheme shave yet been proposed by the Canadian authorities but no final opinion can be expressed, as to the sum required untilColonel Amery has returned from Canada.      We also learn ^the eligibility of migrants from thiscountry who are already in Dominions for assistance underthe Act is now being considered,  by the Law Officers whosedecision will be a material factor in estimating the outlayon Land Settlements Scheme in 1923-4.                                                     We/
     We  are  disposed to consider that on present indications a  total  provision  6f   750,000 for Land Settlement should Le ample.Jf all schemes were  to conform to the Western Australia type,&apos;  the provision required- would &quot;be veiy much smaller.  We think  that the position should he reviewed before the Estimates are closed in the light of the fuller information which  should, then  be available. Loans  to relieve.....di sires a  among settlers Overseas.       We understand that relief to settlers overseas has not hitherto been provided from Imperial Funds and we think that unless given with  the utmost discretion it would be likely to have  undesirable repercussions.  We suggest that a sum of not more  than  4,000 should be provided under the haading of C0r4ir.ge.ncles   and that assistance should be given only in cases where the Dominion Government is willing to contri- bute at  least half and the prior concurrence of the Treasury representative on  the Oversea Settlement Committee is obtained. Stimulating  and Assisting  Child and Youthful Migration.      We are informed that the Oversea Settlement Committee regard this as the most hopeful form of settlement in the long run.  We do not question this but,  as regards children, the cost is much greater per head, than in the case of adults, and the  financial  and economic benefits to this country are less immediate.  One- Voluntary Society,  which has been act- ively engaged in this work, gives the estimated cost at  90per head hut the Oversea Settlement Committee are of opinion that this figure can be reduced.      We understand that it is proposed to co-operate with dominion Governments and Voluntary Societies on the basis of equal contributions by the three parties, but,  unless the voluntary Societies can, --with this inducement,  raise more funds than they have hitherto done,  the  effect  would be thatthe British and. Dominion Governments would staare equally the cost of increases-migration.                                                    We are/
      We are of opinion that contributions  should he madeto any authority or organisation only in respect of  childrensent overseas in excess of the present number of childrennow being sent overseas by the authority or organisation andthat, so long at any rate as the financial  situation in thiscountry remains serious, schemes should not be agreed  unlessthe Secretary of state  a contribution is limited to  a  total sum not exceeding  50 a head in all (including the cost ofpassages and. rail fares).      We understand that youthful migration covers persons at the school leaving age, and that a brief period of  trainingin this country is contemplated.  We see no objection  to moderate expenditure on training in these cases provided thatthere is clear evidence of its usefulness and that theDominion Governments are prepared to^contributWnjat leastequal to that of the Secretary of State.Aidingii the work of voluntary societies .      We und-erstand that the provision proposed, relateslargely to schemes for the migration and settlement  ofchildren, juveniles, and women.  To a large extent,  there-fore it Overlaps with other provisions.  We consider thatthere should not be separate provision for contributions to voluntary Societies for schemes of the type for v/hich  special provision is already made in the Estimates&apos;.  For exampleprovision for contributions to societies in rcepect  ofAssisted passages should be included as a separate item underthe general heading of Assisted passage Schemes.      Provision may, however, he necessary for work by voluntary Societies, calculated to stimulate successfulsettlement, for which no provision is made in the Estimates.We consider that any ehemes of this nature should conform to the provisions of the Act and that the secretary of State&apos;contribution should not generally exceed half the cost -of theextension of activities, but we do not suggest any alteration in the proposed provision of  150,000 for Child Migration,Youthful Migration, and Aiding the Work of Voluntary                                                    Societies/
Societies.Training.  We have grave doubts whether any useful purpose will be served by training in this country for adults,though it is possible that a brief .period of testing in thiscountry may tend to eliminate unsuitable applicants.  In anycase we consider that no such schemes should be approveduntil the usefulness of the expenditure has been clearlydemonstrated, and unless the Dominion Governments concerned are prepared to bear at least half the cost.      The extent, if any, to which the Overseas governments will be prepared to co-operate in training overseas is not at present known.  Should these Governments co-operate insuch schemes, the proposed provision of  50,000 for trainingmay be required.  We think that this provision should, however be subject to review before the Estimates are finally closed.It must be remembered that the Empire Settlement Act 1922contemplates an annual expenditure not exceeding three millionpounds on Empire Settlement.

Since the Provisional Estimate was framed theColonial Office have Informed us that  100,000 of thetotal grant of  350,000 included in the Sketch Estimatewill not be required in the year 1923/24.   The presentestimate of the sum required in 1923/24 is therebyreduced to  250,000.

We are aware that the proposed grant in aid of 800,000 is not sufficient to allow of the executionduring the year 1923/4 of all the works of restorationwhich are urgently required.   Nevertheless,.having regardto the acute financial stringency  we think that it isessential that the Works programme at present contemplatedshould be somewhat retarded, and we recommend the reductionof the grant in aid by  50,000 to  750,000.Scientific Research.

The reductions which we recommend on the sketch estimateof this Vote are as follows:-                                           Uganda A.4.                    200,000    Tanganyika A,5.                 50,000    Scientific Research B5.          8,000    Telegrams G,                     1,000TOTAL:        259,000.   being a reduction  of  the  sketch  estimate  as  submitted of    259,000  but  an  increase  of  &amp;68,278  oh the  estimate for  1922/25.       In the event  of  Rhodesia  deciding In October  in favour   of  incorporation in the Union  of South Africa,  this vote  could be   reduced by  339,000 under  subhead E7  and  probably  by a  substantial   proportion of the  Grant in Aid of  150,000 under subhead  A.8.

The Provisional Estimate for  the year 1923/24 for Police,England and Wales,, shows a decrease of   101,637 on the  estimate forthe year 1922/23.   I understand however that this decrease is dueto the alteration In the method of &quot;payment, of the police gr^ant, theVotedMoney.
 actual  expenditure  which it  is estimated  will be  Incurred  In the year  1923/24  is  therefore  the same  as  in  the current  financial year.           The Scottish  Office have, not been able  to forecast any reduction  of  the  expenditure in the year  1923/24  as compared with the. current financial, year.           I find  great  difficulty in arriving at  any  precise figures as to the expenditure to be incurred on the maintenance of Police  Forces  in the  year 1923/24 for  the following reasons:-      1..   The Police Authorities do not consider  their estimates for the ensuing financial  year until October and  the  Home  Office are of  the opini.cn  that  it  is useless to ask for detailed estimates  at the present date-.      2.    I have enquired  what progress has been made with Carrying out various recommendations as to economy made by the Committee  on National Expenditure.  I understand that the Home Office  and the Scottish Office have up to the present devoted their attention to  realising the economies recommended by the Committee  on National Expenditure in the  current financial year. It Is thought that  the  total reductions aimed at in 1922-23  will be reached, but it  is too  early to say what further economies can be expected in  1923-4*     3.    In particular no special steps have been taken withregard,  to  the recommendation of the Committee on National Expenditure that a  detailed examination of the strength of thevarious County and  Borough Forces should be carried out.   Iunderstand that the procedure contemplated by the Home Office andby the  Scottish Office  Is  as follows: -          All Police Authorities have been instructed to reduce their strength by 5% (4$ In Scotland) and recruiting has been suspended.   When Police Authorities have reduced their forces by the requisite percentage,  the situation will be reviewed and theAuthorities ?/ill be asked  whether they cannot effect  some further
reduction.   It is tJaus^ntended*to put &quot;upon -the&quot;&quot;,T^lic^^utliorl^3^the burden of proving that it is necessary to resume . recruitment, ^and in this way detailed examinations of the strength of thevarious forces will be carried out as and when the question forresuming recruitment arises in each force.   It is claimed thatthis method has the advantage that examination of the strength ofeach force will be carried out in the light of the actual experienceof working on a reduced strength.   I make no comment on this proposed procedure but it increases the difficulty of estimating the number of police wRo will be required in the year 1923/24.     4*   I should have expected that as Immediate effect couldnot be given to certain of the economies recommended by theCommittee on National Expenditure, these economies would have resulted In greater reductions In expenditure in the year 1923/24 -than in the year 1922/23.   The Home Office however inform methat very small additional savings can be anticipated in thisway and that such savings will be offset by annual Increments etc.I am unable to criticise this assumption.     5.   Until the Police Amalgamation Clauses In the MinorEconomies Bill have passed into law, It is not possible to proceedwith the amalgamation of small Police forces.   This is an admin-Istrative reform to which the Secretary of State attaches consider-able importance.   As an example of the anomalies of the existing situation Porfarshire may be instanced - a county which containsno less than six separate Police Forces, each with its own chief constable.   In Brechin this functionary rules nine men.     6.   Police Pay.   I had hoped that It would be possibleto make recommendations for an effective reduction In Police pay.,,.The scale laid down in the Des borough Report, at a time when thecost of living was high and public apprehension great, has been maintained subject to the small reductions imposed last April.
The present wages are very high in relation to the earnings of comparable classes of the community, and in rural districts,where police are paid practically as much as in London, thewages are considered  wholly excessive.   Dissatisfactionexists among rating authorities, ill-will is engendered amongthe artisan classes, and in certain places the police themselves are fully conscious of the disproportion.   The attitude ofthe central authority precludes local  authorities from taking action.   it is for this i&apos;easori that the Scottish Office havesuggested that two or three model scales should he devised fromwhich the local authority should make  its choice subject tothe approval of the central authority,   The argumentative case for a reduction in pay appears to me to he overwhelming.          I am, however, deeply influenced by the views of theHome Secretary.   He is opposed in principle to differentialscales and considers that any early reduction of existingemoluments would react disastrously on the Police service.  Itis impossible to Ignore so grave a statement.          None the less I am of opinion that as soon as theprice of living is stabilised at some  figure substantially belowthe datum line of the Desborough Report, revision as contemplated by. that Report should immediately be made..         Moreover if the present position as to wages is 3ub-stantially unchanged early next summer, the revision of the scales laid down in the Desborough Report should then be takenin hand.         For the reasons stated above.  I am unable to reportwhat reductions can be effected on this Vote in the year 1923/4,as compared with the current financial, year..   No effort shouldbe spared to effect every possible administrative economy In thePolice Service, and I trust that it may be found possible, whenthe Estimates are received from the various Police authorities
to make appreciable reductions in tbe Estimate for the current financial year.   The lines on which the economies can beeffected are dealt with in detail in the Report of the Committeeon Natibnal Expenditure, but 1 wish to refer to the followingpoints.    (1)  Metropolitan Police.   It should again be considered whether the fees charged by the Public Carriage LicensingDepartment can be Increased sufficiently to make that Departmentself-supporting.   The provision made for the Special Constabu- ,lary Reserve should also be examined, but I am unable to makeany definite recommendation on this point.    (2)  The substitution of Police by civilians or pensionersin public buildings, museums, etc. should be actively pursued.In my own Department I am effecting this change with markedeconomy *   Each substitution produces an immediate saving ofsome  250 per annum, a saving which however does not accrue tothe Police Votes.     (5)  The Admiralty and War Office use Metropolitan police to patrol Dockyards and Arsenals in the Provincos.   For instanceat Rosyth the strength of the Police Force is so large&apos; as to bethe subject of general comment in Eastern Scotland.   This smalldistrict, enclosed and self-contained, Is patrolled by about 160police.   By comparison Greenock Burgh has 139, the County ofAyr 201 police.   The attention of the si/ar Office and admiralty should be urgently directed to the desirability of reducing thenumber  of Police employed to the minimum.   It must be rememberedalso that the Central Force In London will not be able to absorball the redundant constables forthwith, and that these savingswill accrue to Admiralty and War Office Votes,

The -gross, increase on the Vote is however  122^499but this figure is offset by increased appropriations in aid and by savings due to the fall in the cost of housing.          This increase is partly caused by the fact that the sketch Estimate for 1923-4 is based on a Prison Population of15,300 while the Estimate for the current financial year iisbased On an estimated Prison Population of 15,500.  provision is also made for an increased expenditure of  42^O&amp;0-on buildings.   ;;     The Prison Commissioners have in mind a large pro-gramme of reform.  The total cost of this programme has hotyet been estimated, but it would be Very considerable.For the year 1923-4 only a variety of comparatively minoradministrative reforms are proposed, including an improvededucational service.   Some of these proposals involvequestions which should be discussed De par tine ntaily with theTreasury, and as to which I make no recommendation.         I understand that proposals have been made for theappointment of a Royal Commission to consider the wholequestion of the Administration of Prisons and Borstal
Institutions.   In- these circumstances I think that apartfrom the financial situation; the present moment is in-opportune, for. making any innovations in the Prison Service-         After discussion with me the Home Office havesuggested the following reductions in the Sketch. Estimate.           (1)  Elimination of proposed                provision for quarters for                Staff at Manchester         -    16,000           (2)  Reduction in the Estimated                prison popo.Iat.ion from -                15,300 to 14,300            -  .  20,000                                                 35,000         I recommend the reduction of the Sketch Estimate bythis amount, subject to departmental discussion .of thesmaller Items on the Vote.-,

CRAWFORD AND BALCARRES.2nd October, 1922.         I recommend that the net total of the Estimate for thisVote should be reduced to  425,000.Scotland.        The average  parental contribution per head per annumis estimated at  1.2s.lOd. for the year 1923-4.   The corresponding figure In England and Wales is approximately  3.6s.0d.    A deter-mlned effort should be made by the Scottish Education Departmentto raise the level of contributions in Scotland to a figureapproximating more closely to the English figure.         The possibility, of closing further schools in scotland is now under consideration, but it is not possible at the presenttime to recommend a reduction In the Sketch Estimate for 1923-4.

On the 16th  June, the Board  of Education submitted a forecast of estimates  for 1923-24.  This showed a total of  44,621,000.           In comparison with  the original Estimate for 1922/23, this total of  44,621,000 showed a reduction of  279*000. The reduction was,  however,  apparent rather than real.   It was chiefly due to an automatic decrease of  674,000 in respect of the post-war scheme of educational training.   The ordinaryj services of the Board showed  a net Increase of  395,000.           The forecast was based upon  an assumed total of expendi-Iture by local Education Authorities to rank for grant of1j 75,450,000 (for elementary education  -  62,650,000 and for higherI education  12,800,000).           Subsequently, as a  result of the fuller Information available with the advancing year and of preliminary consultations with your Sub-Committee, the  Board of  Education was able to estimateI for a reduction of the total expenditure of Local Education I Authorities to rank for grant to  73,500,000  (for elementary jeducation -  61,000,000,and for higher education -  12,500,000). I This reduction would, represent a saving  of  1,074,000 to the Exchequer.   At the same  time, the Board saw  its wny to estimate for a further reduction of  150,000 in grants to  non-Local Education Authorities, and of  15,700 in respect of museums and general cost of administration.   A further reduction of  45,900 will result from the assumed fall in the  rate of war bonus.                               -1-
       The  Estimate for 1923-24 was thus reduced by  1,286,000  to  43,335,000,   Your Sub-Committee has accepted this figure  as a basis for further enquir-y and has proceeded to investigate  whether it can be reduced by additional economies.       2.   The following table shows the principal items  On which  the total estimate of  43,335,000 is  composed  and compares that  forecast with the Estimate for 1922-3.   Having been rendered  at an early period of the year,  when  the results of the  current  year are not yet available for information,  these figures must  be regarded as tentative.

          It will be observed that 87? Of thewhole gross estimated expenditure of the board is required for grants to Local Education Author-ities based upon their total expenditure.   Theestimated total expenditure of Local EducationAuthorities for 1923-24, as already mentioned, is 73,3a),000.

          It will be apparent that if any substantial further economies are to be effected in the Education Estimates, itis in the region of grants to Local Education Authorities,which account for 87;&apos; of the total gross Estimate, that thosegconorriies must be sought.   The relevant head Lag,-? set cut inTable 2 above will, therefore, now be briefly examined inorder to point out the directions in which, in the opinion ofyour Sub-Committee, reductions can reasonably be effectedtherein.               SALARIES OF TEACHERS.     3.   This is by far the largest itew of expenditure,accounting for over 71? of the total expenditure of the l.e.a&apos;son elementary education.   The general principle that the burnham Settlement is not to be disturbed before the date,1st April 1925, at which the Burnham scales will automaticallycome up for revision, was adopter- by the Cabinet earlier  in theyear,   It is, therefore, assumed that the scales must  stand for the year 1923-24.          Your Sub-Committee is, however,  of opinion thatcertain economies can be effected in rates of remunerationwithout interfering with the Burnham Settlement or altering the Burnham scales.   It is suggested by the Board of Educationthat salaries lower than those of the Burnham scales might bepaid to new entrants.   This would involve no disturbance ofthe Burnham Settlement because, according  to the  terms  ofthat Settlement, the Burnham  scales are to apply  to thoseonly who were already employed as teachers  at the time  of theSettlement.          Your Sub-Committee  is  strongly of opinion that  thissuggestion should be adopted  and acted upon, forthwith.    It  isof opinion that  it would be not unreasonable if initialsalaries of  certificated men  were lowered  by  25  per annum
(2 annual increments)  and those of women by  37.10s.  perannum (5 annual increments).    This would result in a saving on the Estimate for 1923/24 of  100,000, and of  250,000 forthe following year,     4.   Moreover, unlike the rest of the country, the scales of pay of London teachers are subject to revision on 1st April1923 and if the London Education Authority then reduce the scales the Exchequer will benefit proportionately.     5.   If any further substantial economies are to beeffected in the matter of teachers&apos; salariesj they must besought in a reduction in -      (A) the number of teachers, and in      (B) the class of teacher employed,         A. The number of tefichers employed is chieflydetermined by  -      (i) the number of children to be taught, and      (ii) the  proportion of  teochers to  children.         As to (i) -          The  Board of Education estimates that, If  the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill becomes  law in the  autumn,  the clause  in that Bill which makes the  attendance  of  children under six optional may resxilt  in a. reduction  of  the  average number of  children in attendance  of  160,000.    On  the  other hand, the Board  estimates that the raising of the  school  age  to 14 on the 1st  July,  1922,  may increase  the average  attendance  by 100,000.    The consequent  net  average  reduction in children in attendance  would  be 60,000.    Your Sub-Committee is  of opinion that this  figure  is probably by no means an  over-estimate of the net reduction  in  average  at;endance  that may be expected                              -6-
          As to (11) -          Your Sub-Committee is informed by the Board ofEducation that it is consistently pursuing the policy of economy in the matter of the proportion of teachers to children,but it is.recognised that in certain areas, the Local EducationAuthorities still maintain too high a proportion.          The Code of regulations for Elementary Schoolsrecently Issued by the Board foreshadows measures for graduallyreducing staff in such areas, and. requiring Head Teachers inthe smaller and mi &apos;dle-sized schools to teach.          In view of these measures the Board has allowed inits Sketch Estimate for 1923/24 for a reduction of 1,129 Inthe number of teachers, over and above the reduction whichwotild be justified by the expected decline in averageattendance referred to under A (l) above.  .  Your Sub-Committeeis of opinion that the above-mentioned reduction of 1,129teachers does not represent the maximum that might reasonably be effected in the immediate future by the prompt acceptance by all Local Education Authorities of standards of staffingthat are In themselves adequate.  . It Is of opinion that further substantial, economy can be. effected In this matter Inthe coxxvse of the year 1923/24, without loss of educationalefficiency.     B.    In the recently Issiied code referred to  above, theBoard provides for larger employment of less highly qualifiedteachers in  some *reas,  and for the employment of  less highlyqualified  teachers in the instruction of the y/oungest children(i.e, infants&apos; classes).
          It is not clear to. your Sub.-Committee&quot; that themaximum economy that, can be attained by a prompt and rigidenforeement of these measures has been allowed for in theBoardfs forecast of Estimate for 1923/24*     6.   Your Sub-Committee now proceeds to deal with themanner in whidh the,possible economies as regards teachers&apos;ssalaries which have been referred to in the foregoing paragraphs can be effected in practice.   It is necessaryhere to refer briefly to the special characteristic of thecontrol exerciasa by the State, through the Board of Education,over educational expenditure.   The Board does not itselfdirectly control the expenditure of by far the greater partof the,public money that Is  spent cn education.   That is done by the Local Education  Authorities.   If, therefore,economies are to be effected, it is the Local EducationAuthorities in the  first place that must effect them.   Thechief.Influence that.the Board can exert in the directionof the reduction of expenditure  is indirectly by excludingfrom the calculation of  grant on the  ground that It  Isextravagant.^, In,order  therefore that any necessary reductionsmay be effected, the Board must  be put in a position toexercise indirect  financial  pressure  in  a prompt and efficientmanner.   For this  reason, it appears  to your Sub-Committeethat the Board&apos;s Estimates are  specially suited  for theapplication of the. method  of control  by  the fixation of maximum totals of  expenditure.          To  enable the  Board effectively to  require LocalEducation Authorities  to avoid  extravagance and  waste  ingeneral,, and  to adhere to  economical  standards  In  the  matterof  staffing in particular,  it is eminently  desirable that anamount should be fixed beyond which  the  expenditure of LocalEducation Authorities..will not  be recognised  for grant.   This
principle has already in effect been accepted by theChamberlain Committee and adopted hy the Cabinet for theEducation Estimates of the current year.           The Economy (Miscellaneous pr5vis ions) Bill now before Parliament will ekiable the Board to make the maximaeffective and, in the opinion of your Sub-Committee, isessential for that purpose.           Applying the method of control by maximum totals inthe present case, your Sub-Committee is of1 opinion that areduction should be made in the total sum of  73,500,000 to bsrecognised for grant, ih respect of tho ftirther economies inthe matter of teachers1 Salaries as specified in the foregoing paragraphs.   The amount of the reduction is dealt with hero-after.     EXPENDITURE OP LOCAL AUTHORITIES OB ADMIN L5TRATI ON *   7.      Expenditure on administration hy Local EducationAuthorities is undoubtedly a matter which needs to be closelywatched in the interests of economy and efficiency in order to check waste in the form, on tho one hand, of methods that are over elaborate, and on the other, of methods that are slovsnly.The task of safeguarding economy in this direction is a difficult one:  Local Authorities ore not wont to batolerant of interference with their business methods.  Never-theless, no stage of the administration of education is more likely to degenerate into extravagance.  Your Sub-Committeorecognises that the Board of Education is fully alive to thaspecial attention required by this matter.  It learns, forinstance, that the Board has recently undertaken through itsexpert staff to advieo and assist certain Local EducationAuthorities in the improvements of their methods of officebusiness and of accoraiting, an activity on the part of thaBoard which your Sub-Committee believes is capable of the                           -9.                     most/
most beneficial results and might with advantage&quot; &quot;be extendedas opportunity is afforded.     Your Sub-Committee find, however, that there is evidencethat the administration of no inconsiderable number ofLocal education Authorities is by no means as economical asis to be desired.  There is a striking discrepancy between theexpenditure per child of different authorities.  London .;hhalargest centre, spends 17/lld. per child; some small urban districts spend as little as 2/- per child; the averageexpenditure of all Local education ^uthorities is 10/4d  perchild.   Again,  by far the greater proportion of expenditure onadministration consists of expenditure oh salaries (otherthan teachers&apos;) and the salary scales of Local educationAuthorities, as a rule, are based on the principle of thevariable bonus; but comparison of the amounts paid by LocalEducat j.on authorities with those paid in the Civil Servicesirggests that sufficient reduction is not being made by theformer in proportion to the fall in the cost Of living.     Your bub-Committee have formed the opinion that thereis room for further economy in expenditure on administration,and that, in order to strengthen the hands of the Board ofEducation promptly to enforce upon Local education authorities the necessary economical methods and standards in thisparticular,  it  is desirable that a reduced total, less thanthat estimated  by the hoard in its above forecast, should befixed for the expenditure of Local Education Authorities tobe recognised for grant.     OTHER EXPEND IT UK&amp; OP LOCAL EDUCATION AUTHORITIES.       8. In the case of the objects of expenditure included under this heading, as in the case of expenditure on admin is-..tration, your bub-Committee find that there is evidence thatthe methods of some Local Education Authorities are not as                                                   economical

Against, comparison with the  cost of similar services,according to figures supplied by the Office  of Viorks,Stationery Office, and the Treasury Inspector of Hates,suggests that the  reductions that  are  now being effected in the case of these services by the Local EducationAuthorities are not as great as they should  be in view of the                                                   general
,general, fall .in  the  o&amp;et of  laeoux.^and, roaterials,   YourBub-Committee  is therefore of  opinion  that farther-eeoucmlee&apos;&quot;oan  be  effected  in this region of expaftditure,  and  that  inthis case, as  in others referred to  above, a  reduction by  a fixed sum of the total beyond  which  the  expenditure of LocalEducation authorities will not be recognised  for grant,  wouldenable  the board of  Education  promptly to realise for thebenefit of the taxpayer the  economies  in question.         LIMIT  TO E ALE h&apos; DI &apos;117 HE ON ElELj^M&apos;AhY ELD GAT I OH     8.  Your bub-Committee have refrained so far fromspecifying in  figures the reduction  which in  its opinion should  be made in the expenditure by Local educationAuthorities to be recognised for grant in respect of the headings of expenditure under  consideration.  It has done  sobecause  it believes  that in  applying to  the educationEstimates the principle of fixed ma&amp;Lsea, it is  practicallydesirable that the maximum should be applied to a totalcovering as wide an  area of  expenditure  as may  be possible,and  that it should be left to  the Board  of Education, with whom is  the executive responsibility,  to distribute the economies whioh  are  thus rendered necessary between thevarious  headings included in the total.     It  now remains, however,  in pursuance of these principles, that a fixed total sum should be named  by whichthe  total expenditure of Local Education Authorities onelementary eduction  to be recognised for grant  should bereduced, ih consideration of the possible economies referredto above.  Your  bub-Committee  is of  opinion that the totalof  61,000,000 forecasted by the Board of Education in Table2 above  should be reduced by  l,0u0,000  to  60,000,000(which  would result  in a saving of  560,000 to  fhe  Exchequer).Your Sub-Committee is satisfied that this reduction can  bo                                                effected

HIGSEB EDUCATION.     10. In forecasting the figure of  12,500,000 as thetotal expenditure  by  Local Education: authorities  on higher education  to be recognised for grant (as  shewn in &apos; stable  2)the Board  of education has started with  a figure  of . 13,928,000 as the probable expenditure  in 1922-23 as  a basis.In order to arrive at a figure for 1923-24 the Board havededucted from that figure  the sum of  207,000,  in respect  ofexpenditure to be  saved by the closing of Continuation schools and  200,000 in respect of expenditure to be  saved by  the discontinuance of  the system  of  double grants  to  ijeoon&amp;arySchools not provided  by Looal Education  Authorities,  TheBoard thus arrives at the  figure of   12,500,000 for 1923-24.It has to  be taken into account  that automatic increases of salaries of teachers  In secondary Schools and  other places of Higher  Education on the BUrnham scales will require an expenditure in 1923-24 of  some  320,000  in excess of similarexpenditure in 1922-23; but as against this,  the  hoard hopesto be able to effect  equivalent  economies&apos; by  measures  nowbeing taken for decreases  in&apos;  the numbers  of -teachers and forincrease in fees,  and by the  fall in the  cost  of  labour and materials.     On consideration of all  relevant factors  , yourSub-Committee is not  convinced: that  in thus  allowing a sumof the order of  320,000 for  economies to be  effected  by thereduction  of staff and prices, and by the raising Of fees,the estimate of the iioard  of  Education allows  for all  the economies-in these directions that are possible,  and indeed                                          essential
                                                             3 9 oessential in the present state of the national finances,In this connection ii shduld  be observed that ranch of what has teen said above as io uneooffloinibsl. standards in the.matter of administration and  Other Expenditure as regardselementary education applies  with equal force to higher education,     11,  There is further a;  special particular in whicheconomies should be obtainable that would result in a reductionof the 1923.-24 estimate for higher education,  It is that ofthe training of teachers,  AS already described, measures are being taken by the Board  of education that will result ina reduction in the number of  teachers employed.  If the reduced maxima for elementary education recommended hereinare adopted, it may be expected that those measures will be accelerated.  It should therefore be possible in the immediatefuture to reduce the number of toachers taken into training,with consequent oconomies in  the expenditure on training colleges.  A general review of the situation and of future requirements has yet to be undertaken by the Board ofEducation, when the returns of teachers Jn employment afterthe rummer vacation become available.   when that review hasbeen made your Uib-Commit tee  believes that it will be possibleto forecast a restricted programme for admission of newstudents to training oolleges at the beginning of  theiracademic year in September 1923.  economies may therefore beanticipated in this direction which will permit of asubstantial reduction in the  total estimate for higher education-tion now foreshadowed by the  Board.     12,  Tho principle of control by fixed maxima was adoptedby the Cabinet for the higher education estimate in the current                                                     year
year.  The limit of  11,000,000 for the expenditure ofl..e.*a &apos;s to be recognised for grant which was recommended bythe Oeddes Committee was rejected as impossible ofattainment, but a limit of  13,000,000 was adopted for1922-23,  with the addition that &quot;a further reduction inrespect of 1923-24 should be considered later in the year&quot;.     Your Oub-Committee recognises that the limit nowproposed by tho board of Education of  12,500,000 goes someway to meet the requirement thus made by the Cabinet; butit is of opinion that the maximum may be fixed for 1923-24at a somewhat lower figure without any undue sacrifice.It is observed that after the maximum had been fixed at 13,000,000 for 1922-23,  a large reduction on the estimatesput in by the Local author it ies, the Local EducationAuthorities succeeded in reducing expenditure promptlywithin the new limitj to  12,927,000.     Your kub-*Oomaittee therefore recommend that for theyear 1923-24 the maximum expenditure of Local EducationAuthorities on higher education to be. recognised for grant should be reduced to  12.250,000.     The further&apos; saving to the exchequer will be  125,000.

The  sum to be deducted, is  45,900,     Your Sub-Committee have closely enquired Into thepossibility of effecting further  staff economies,  Theadditional work imposed upon the  Board by the introduction  ofthe Superannuation levy, which will cost at  least  5,000 inthe year 1983-24 renders it difficult to effect any saving  onthe Clerical Staff.     AG regards the Administrative staff, tho Board havealready suppressed 4 further posts thereby  effecting a saving of  3,10.0,.  By the non-filling vacancies and. by certain  othereconomies the Board can effect further reductions amounting to IE,500,;bringing the total to  15,700,  In  the presentexceptional circumstances,  which  require specially closeinvestigation of the expenditure  of local authoritiesfurther reductions at the present moment would need closeinvestigation and for the purposes of this-  report, yourSub-Committee have accepted the above figure.     The expenditure on administration and  inspection will stand at  787,102, being a reduction of  56,000 or nearly
Conclusion     14.  The figure of  43,335,000 which was adopted as thebasis for further enquiry can under the above recommendationsbe reduood                                              &amp;as to Grants to Local iiducation   Authorities for elementary   education by                            -560,000as to Grants to Local education   Authorities for higher   education by                             125,000in all ............   685, 000making a revised total of  42,650,000.

The Sketch Estimate originally submitted by theDepartment in June showed a saving on the                                                    estimate for 1922-23...of .................      279,000and the total reductions set out in thisreport amount to........................    1,971,000showing a total reduction in 1923-24, by comparison with the. estimates of 1922-23, of  2,i250, 000     Of this reduction  674,000 is due to an automatic decreasein respect of the cost of the post war scheme of educationaltraining: on the Other hand,  the cost of the ordinary servicesof the Board is reduced by  1,576,000 dwspite automaticincreases of  500,000 on the cost of teachers&apos; pensions andof  1,000,000 on teachers&apos; salaries due in 1923-24 under theoperation of the $urnllam scales.                                               15.  finally

It may at first sight appear anomalous  that thereduction on the Scottish Vote is  623,626 on  6,713,314viz. over 9fe while the English Vote is reduced  by  2,250,000on  44,900,000 or by 5$ only.   The explanation is as follows.The sums drawn from the Exchequer in respect of grants  to scottish Local Authorities and of pensions to Scottish teachersare paid into a fund and savings are not surrendered at the close of the year,,    The Scottish figure in any year is basedon the English estimates in that year;  if at the oloas ofthe year it is found that the English estimates have beenunderspent,  Scotland has received too muoh by 11/0Oths  of thedifference between the English estimates and the Eagliahactual expenditure.  This differ once has to be  adjustedunder statute in a subsequent year.   The Scottish Votewill require adjustment in this manner in 1923-24 inrespect of a large surrender on the English Vote for 19 23/22*Grants to Universities and Colleges.

   follow from the transfer of responsibility, for Irish   Universities and Collages.   If exactly- carried out this   recommendation would have reduced  the estimate for 1922-23   to  1,089,000.  It was, however, necessary in view of the   report of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge   to transfer to the list of recurrent grants sums of  30,000   in respect of each University and in addition a margin   of  20,000 was provided in respect of a special enquiry   proceeding into the Imperial College.    The vote was   accordingly fixed at  1,169,000 viz.  80,000 above the   Geddes figure.   It is now proposed to repeat this sum in   1923-24.        It must be recognised that with falling prices, the   real assistance given by the State to the Universities is   increased if the total of the cash grant is maintained   at its present level.   But your Sub-Committee do not   consider  that this arg-ament is sufficient to justify a   reduction on the vote for  the reasons that (a) a very   substantial cut was made this year in the face of   considerable opposition and further reductions,, which could   not be large, would revive the controversy;  (b) some increase   from year to year in State assistance is almost Inevitable   as the Universities develop:  (o)  a reduction in the State   grant  not only direotly withdraws money from the Universities   but tends also to make their task  of obtaining assistance   from Local Authorities and Approved Benefactors more difficult.        Your Sub-Commit tea recommend-accordingly- that the   grails  should remain unchanged.                             (Sgd.)  HILTON Y0UHS*2nd October,  1922.

     It will be seen that out of a total of  20, 824,800, the sketch Estimate presented, by the Ministry of Health for 1923/24,approximately  15,000,000 is estimated expenditure in respectof Housing (approximately  9,000,000) and National HealthInsurance (approximately  6, 000, OoO.);.  a further  1,000,000represents expenditure in respect of certain activities ofthe Unemployment Grants Committee, which is borne on thisVote for purposes of convenience.  Apart, therefore, fromthe cost of administration, the Ministry is left with a sumof little more than  3,000,000 in respect of Its Health workproper, i,,e. the grants for /Tuberculosis, Maternity and child Wolf are, Venereal Diseases, Welfare of the Blind, eto.The Sub--Committee desire at the outset to emphasise this aspect of the Estimates of this Department in order toindicate the limited sphere within which economies are practicable, unless there is a fundamental change in policy.In short, nothing but a repudiation by the Government of itsundertaking to bear the whole of  the deficit in respect ofthe Housing scheme, less the product of the penny rate, oran entire recasting of the whole  system of National HealthInsurance, could effect drastic reductions in this Estimate.The $ub-Committee nevertheless have been favourably impressed by the continuous efforts whioh the Ministry have made toreduce expenditure during the past two years.     2.   It will be convenient to taice the main Subheadsof the Vote as Indicated above and report under each headthe result of the Sub-Committee&apos;s investigation..                    (1)   ADMINISTRATION.     The Sketch Estimate as presented provides  for areduction in 1923/24 of  106,907,  This  reduction follows ona cut  of  656,.648 as between, the  last and the current financial
year&apos;a estimate *   In  response  to further  pressure  therepresentatives of the Ministry of  Health have  indicated that they may  be  able to make  a further reduction  of 10,000  on their  Sketch Estimate figure *    art  of  thissaving would be in respect  of  the transference  suggestedby the Sub-Oommittee  of the whole or part of  the non-compliance insurance  work from the  temporary  to thepermanent staff0                  (2)   HOUSING..     The Sketch Estimate of the Ministry  of 1923/24places the charge in  respect of the deficit on  the housing scheme at  9,450,000.  They admitted, however,  that thereal figure would be   9,300,000, were it  not  that  theMinister proposed to  keep in hand  150,000 for utilisationin connectJon with an extension, on a much lower basis of subsidy, of the Housing Scheme.  The Sub-Committeeunderstand that the Minister has already  approached theCabinet on this matter, and that the Cabinet  took  the viewthat any further expenditure in respect of Housing shouldbe regarded rather as part of  the Government18 programmetowards meeting Unemployment,  than  as .a part  of the housing programme,  which has been stabilised at 176,, 000 houses,either built or building.  The Sub-Committee  agree Withthis view.   They now understand that in vie%  of thereduction of the rates of interest on money borrowed afterthe beginning of the present financial year the deficit on the existing Housing ocheme to be met  by the exchequer in 1923/24 will fall to be reduced  by a further  200,000on the Sketch Estimates as originally presented,,Assuming therefore that any further expenditure which maybe approved by the Cabinet in  respect of  Housing will come
out of money set aside in respect of  Unemployment  and notOut of this Subhead of the MinistryJs Vote,  the  revisedfigure for 1923/24 for this Subhead will be   9,100,000,a reduction of  350,000 on the  Sketch Estimate as originally presented.     The Sub-Committee very carefully considered thesuggestion which was originally made  by the  geddes committee that a vigorous policy of sale of  houses shouldbe adopted in order  to reduce the taxpayerTs burden.    Inview,  however, of the fact that the Cabinet  has  already decided against the insertion) in the Economy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill of a clause enaoling the Minister to compelLocal Authorities to. sell, and  of the fact that  under theEent Restrictions Act free possession of houses  cannot be given ,  the Sub-Committee see very little prospect  of any material saving in the subsidy  from sales.   They understandthat a Departmental Committee is at the present  timeconsidering the Question of the continuance  of the rent restrictions Act...  Should that  Committee recommend a con-tinsanee&apos; of the Act and should the Government decide toaccept such a recommendation,  the policy of  sale willcontinue to be ineffective.

In viewof the steady decline in the cost of living  they suggested to the Ministry that a material reduction on the figuresproposed might not unreasonably be obtained  by arbitrarilyfixing the total of each grant for a term of years  and rationing Local Authorities accordingly.   To this  theMinistry replied that while Lord Meston*s Percentage  GrantsCommittee was exploring the whole situation  as regards thebasis of Government grants it would be  unfair to prejudge the position by virtually imposing the  block graftt .systernin respect of these Health Grants.   This argument  iscertainly not without weight.   Furthermore, the                              -5-
representatives of the Ministry urged that the fallin the cost of living was more than offset by theautomatio increase of expenditure resulting from commit-monts which could not now be repudiated without breach of faith.   On the other hand the sub-Commit tee %  whileacknowledging that commitments must be honoured,  pointedout that the Minister had proposed to reserve  120,000                        i      -I                        iin respect of contingencies and developments for the maternity and Child Welfare Service, and  24,000 for theVeneroai Diseases service   Moreover the tables of per capita costs which the sub-Committee called for indicatedvery wide variations, in the cOsts of different institu-tione, variations which could only be accounted for bya less economical expenditure of money by some adthoritiesthan others.   The Sub-Committee understand that theMinistry of Health are now carrying out exhaustive localinvestigations into the administration and expenditureof Local Authorities on grant-aided services, with a viewto standardising the main items of expenditure at thelowost figures consistent with efficiency, and enquiringinto all local variations and apparent extravagances.  Theyhave not, however, in framing the Sketch estimate for 1923/24 made allowance for any economies as a resultof these investigations.  Having regard to this fact, andto the admission by the representatives of the Ministryof Health that the Sketch estimates in respect of maternity and Child Welfare and Venereal Diseases contained a substantialmargin for development, the Sub-Committee consider that thePublic Health Grants as a whole should be reduced by  100,000.These grants constitute in the sub-CommitteeTs view  the most useful form of the Ministry1 s activities, and  they understand                             -6-
tr,  that any further cut would res tat in a general, eairtailment  of the services and the  actual closing of  beds.   They are  not prepared therefore  tb  taica the responsibility for  advising a larger reduction than  100,000^                   (4) ILEA1TH IH3UPAMPB.,         The Sub-Commit tee examined tho possibility of economies  in the cost of Health Insurance from two  standpoints:-     (a) the possibility of  effecting a reduction in the  cost of administration,     (b) tha possibility that the estimate  of expenditure  in respect of sickness  claims had been over-estimated.         AS regards (a) the  Sub-Committee understand that  under the present arrangements Approved Societies are  allowed to appropriate  out of Insurance Funds to the cost  of administration a sum not exceeding 4/10  a member until  31st Dec amber 1922, and that the  Ministry of Health propose  to effect a reduction of this figure to 4/5 a member if  possible.   On the other hand the Sub-Committee suggested  that the Exchequer would gain to a much greater extent  if  in return for permitting Approved Societies to retain the  present sum in respect of  administration they could be  induced to assume the cost of audit, valuation, etc   Such  an arrangement if practicable would save the Exchequer  between   200,000 and  250,000 as against the  60,000 which  the  Exchequer would save by a reduction of 4/10 to 4/5.  Moreover  this latter reduction of  60,000 would be only of temporary  duration, as the money saved would in the end revert to  Approved societies reserves and be available for additional  benefits towards which the State would be liable to contribute  its usual proportion of 2/9ths,   In  answer to this suggestion  the Ministry of Health urged that Societies were clearly  under tha impression that the original Geddes suggestion
 that  the  cost  of  audit  (the most expensive of the items mentioned above)  should be  transferred  to society funds, would not be re-opened  until December 1923,   The Ministry further pointed out  that  they would have a much stronger case  to induce the doctors  to accept a  lower capitation fee in December 1923 if  it  could be shown that societies had accepted a lower administration charge in January orApril  1923,   In  view of  these representations the Sub- Committee do not  press  their proposal.   They consider that tho  transferring of  the cost of audit, valuation, etc,, to Approved Societies could more appropriately be effected by the legislation which is  inevitable in December 1923..  On theassumption that any  extra cost of medical benefit would then have to be met  by an increase of contributions, the State would havo  to  bear  its two-ninths share in respect-thereof.   The estimates  of the Ministry of Health have not provided for this contingency except in so far as tho y proposeto keep in hand the  saving  of  60,000 contemplated as aresult of reducing Approved societies8 administration charges from 4/10 to 4/5  a member.     As regards (b)  the Sub-Committee are greatlyr impressed by the fact tnat  for  each of the past three years theBicxness claims have  been over-estimated to the extent of 500,000 to ,2600,000  per annum, and that uha  experience ofthe last 6 months indicates a similar result for thepresent financial year.     The Committee understand that the  estimates of sickness and disablement claims have hitherto been based upon theexperience of friendly  societies, the latest tables availablebeing the Manchester Unity  Experience 1893-7, when an additionof about 13 per oent was made to this experience to compensate for the fact that the friendly societies in general dealt with selected  lives.
     It appears to the Committee that the actual results  &apos;of the past few years indicate that this experience of 25 to30 years ago, weighted as it is, is decidedly too high forthe present day.   Such a conclusion is  home out hy thegeneral indications that tho health of the community as awhole is improving;  largely, no doubt,  as a result of theheavy expenditure of the nation on health and social services in the past decade,     Another important factor tending to reduce claims for sickness benefit is the expensive provision now made  for insurance against unemployment, covering some 12 millions ofthe employed population.   The fact that the rate of unemploymentbenefit is higher than tho rate of sickness benefit tends to throw tho charge in border line cases on to the UnemploymentPund.   If trade improves substantially in the course of  thenext year this factor will diminish in importance, but past experience would indicate that any revival of trade would itself tend to reduco the claims for sickness benefit.    In view of those considorations the  Sub-Commit toeare of opinion that there is adequate ground for a sub-stantial reduction in tho estimate for grants in aid of sickness and disablement benefits for 1923-24.   After consultation  withtha Government Actuary, the Ministry of Health are preparedto reduce tha sketch estimate by  250,000 but the sub-Committeethink that tho reduction should bo at least  490,000.   3.

          The very large increase of  1,022,746 is mainly due, the Sub-Committee understand,  to the fact that the deficit on the Housing Schemes of Local Authorities has matured much less rapidly in Scotland, than in England, owing to the slower rate of progress in building.   The result is that althoughthe provision requiring to be made under the Housing Subheadshows a very substantial Increase on the corresponding pro-vision for the current year the maximum deficit in scotland will not be reflected ih the Estimates made1 until 1924/5 or possibly the following year.   Moreover next year there willbe no receipts from the sale of building materials.          The same general remarks which were made by theSub-Committee in their report on the Ministry of Health asregards the limited sphere within which real economies are practicable apply with equal force to this Department.Moreover as the policy and practice  of the Scottish Board ofHealth foJlow for the most part those of the English Ministryof Health our conclusions can be shortly summarised as follows:          2*    (1)  ADMINISTRATION.          The estimate  for the  cost  of Administration  for1923/24 of   138,020 shows a  decrease of  10,510 on theEstimate for 1922/23.   As in the  case of  the  Ministry ofHealth, a very  substantial cut  in  the cost of  administration was made In the Estimates for the  current  financial year.In  response to  further  enquiries by the  Sub-Committee, theScottish Board  of Health propose to effect a  further  reductionof  approximately  3,000  in respect of Administration.   TheSub-Committee note with satisfaction that  no  special  provision has been made in the  Sketch  Estimates  for  the  compilation  of statistics  relative to  the  illnesses of  insxired persons.The;/  understand that  the Permanent Consultative Committee  on
Statistics advised against worn: on the 1921 Insurance Cards.If any work on the 1922 cards  voere contemplated the Sub-Committee suggest that the Permanent Consultative  Committeeon Statistics should first be  consulted.               (2)  HOUSING.          The Board have concurred in the proposal made bythe Sub-Committee that payments on account to Local Author!-ties in respect of the Housing Subsidv In 1923/24  should  be restricted to 55/  instead of the 70;&quot;- as  contemplated by theBoard in their Sketch Estimates.   By this means the Estimatein respect of the Housing Subsidy will be reduced; by approxi-mately  191,000..

          The Scottish Boar-d of Health advance argumentsgenerally- similar to those given &quot;by the English Ministryof Health against the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposal of a general reduction in these grants by 15&quot; over a period of years.The Sub-Committee have not pressed this reduction in thecase of the Ministry of Health for the reasons indicatedin their report on that Department.   This conclusionapplies equally to the Scottish Board of Health.   unlike the Ministry of Health, however, who reserved a. considerablesum,  144,000, for possible contingencies and developments in respect of the Maternity and Child Welfare and VenerealDiseases Services, the Scottish Board of Health have made no provision in their Sketch Estimates for any expenditure\irebeyond that to which they are already absolutely committed.For this reason and in view of the close scrutiny which theBoard are making into expenditure on these services, theSub-Committee do not recommend any reduction in the figureinserted in the Sketch Estimates, apart from a reduction of 1,000  in the Part Sanitation grant which the Board have themselves proposed,               (4)  NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE.           The remarks made by the Sub-Committee in theirreport on the Ministry of Health under this heading apply with equal force here.   A similar over-estimate during recent years has been made in respect of sickness claims in Scotland, and the Sub-Committee suggest that the sketch estimate in respect of sickness claims in 1923/24 shouldbe reduced by not less than  50,000.
          (5) SUBHEAD K - RELIEF OF DEPENDANTS OF                      REPATRIATED RUSSIANS.          Provision Is made under this Subhead for the follow-ing items relative to the dependants of Russians who returnedto Russia for military service in terms of the Anglo-russian military Service Convention, 1917:-     (a) Cost of repatriation of a few Lithuanian         women and children whose departure has been         delayed for various reasons.     (b) Repayment in full of expenditure by Parish         Councils according to the Treasury scale in         maintaining destitute women and children of         &quot;Russian&quot; nationalities other than Lithuanian.     (c) Partial repayment of the expenditure of certain         Parish Councils in maintaining destitute         Lithuanian women and children who have declined         the offer of repatriation.          The Sub-Committee understand that the Ministry ofHealth have got rid of their corresponding liability by a lump sum payment, and they suggested to the Board that thematter should be similarly dealt with in the case of Scotland.The Board concur in the Sub-Committee&apos;a proposal sr d suggestthat a lump sum of  7,200 would liquidate the government sliabilities under this head.   Thev further suggest that part( 3,200) of this lump sum should be found out of savings onthe current year&apos;s Vote, provision for the remaining  4,000being made in next4 year&apos;s Estimates, the sum already includedtherein for the annual cost of this Service.   The Sub-Committee concur generally In this proposal, but they thinkthat the question as regards the precise sum to be set asideshould be further considered by the Treasury in consultationwith the Scottish Board of Health.          3.   The savings suggested by the Sub-Committee ascompared ??ith the Board1 s original Estimate are summarised in the table below.

 2.    It will  be  observed  that  451,000 of the tstal gross estimate  of  529,000 represents contributions to local authorities expenditure in regard to mental defectives.  The Sub-Committee are  glad to learn that by careful enquiry the Board of  Control  have been able t o effect considerable reduo-                                                            t tions in  this expenditure and that a further substantial saving in the current year is anticipated owing to the numbers of mortal defectives  under treatment proving to be below the estimates.  After  a careful review of all the circumstances the Begird are able to reduce their Eketoh estimate of contribution- butiotiH to local authorities for 1923/24 from  451,000 to  4J.C..C0C:,  The sub-Committee are hopeful that before tho seitimatse for 1923/24 come to be prepared it may be possible to&apos;reduce this figure somewhat further, bttt it would be unwise to count  on any further reduction .at present, 3.    They do not recommend any reductions at present on other subheads, but the  reorganisation of the staff now under oon--sideration should  lead to appreciable economies.  Ths increase of  1,000 under subhead F is in. respect of the establishment of occupational centres which should tend to reduce the need for the far more expensive institutional accommodation and shoiId therefore be approved. 4. ,   The net sketch estimate Is therefore reduced to  480,730      Tha  Sk**tc:*.

The grant in aid of scientific Investigation and research( 300) was removed  from these  estimates when the responsibilityfor research into mental deficiency was removed to theMedical Research Council and  we  do not recommend that It beagain inserted.

2.  In the ordinary course this group of votes is examined by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in January,  bywhich time the proposals of the different Departments havebeen considered in detail, the probable trend of prices inthe forthcoming financia.1 year can be forcast, and the  Officeof Works are able to state how work has progressed in  thecurrent year and what provision will be required in the nextyear for remanet expenditure.     An examination in September has none of these advantages and can accordingly give only approximate results.     Subject to this reservation, your sub-committee hasexamined the sketch estimates as closely as practicable with sir Lionel Earle and the other officers of the department and has formed the opinion that the sketch estimateOf                5,536,517can safely be reduced by         300,000         to       5 * 236,517This reduction has beer effected as follows:-     (i) The Post Office building programme for New Workshas been reduced from  537,000 to  400,000 as a maximum whichlatter figure is accepted by that Department, and the  new works subhead for Art and Science Buildings has been reducedby  10,000 in respect of Museum fittings which can be met from other subheads of the Vote.     In view of the representations of the First commissioner of Works your sub-committee feels that it is necessary  to postpone, the contemplated rebuilding of the Mint for which 50;000 was inserted in the sketch estimate as the provisionfor 1923/34.     (ii)  The sketch estimate included a revote for  44,000in respect of a purchase of land at Eltham which it is  now                          ... 3 -                  found/
found will &quot;be completed this year,  while  the provision on the House Building Vote for which  50,-000 Was  taken in &quot;the sketch estimate can be replaced by  a token sum.     (iii).  By reducing the provision for Removals by 23,300 (Revenue Buildings Vote  5,300; public buildingsVote  15,000; Labour and Health Buildings Vote  2,000):and by reducing the provision for maintenance on  the miscellaneous Legal Buildings Vote  by   2,500 and  that forfuel on Labour Buildings by  4,800.     The above savings total to  321,600   but doubtshaving been expressed as to the sufficiency of the provisionfor pensions Hospitals and the Engineering maintenanceprovision On the Vote for Public Buildings this figure hasbeen reduced to   300,000.3.     The provision proposed in the Sketch Estimates,under certain main heads of expenditure,  shows the followingreductions, viz.               Maintenance     14$               Rentals         15fa               Fuel, Light                 and Water      8%               Purni ture        1%The bases on which the Office of Works have framed their estimates under these heads have been examined but yoursub-committee is of opinion that no further reduction can properly be made from the figures at the present  time; theadditional information which will be available in Januarymay or may not justify a further reduction then.    The standards of maintenance,cheating etc.,  agreed between the Office of Works and the Treasury,  are much below pre-war and, apart from the fall in prices  and costs,further economies can only be secured by a reduction in  thenumber of Government employees, (or by a deliberate  changein the standard of accommodation e.g.  the abolition oflifts).
4.   The area of possible further retrenchment at the presenttime is confined to the New  &apos;.orks subheads.  These totalled 1,155., 523 in 1922/23 while, with the reduction recommendedabove,  the total for 1923/24 Mil be  1,081,995.     The latter figure Includes  106,000 for a legationat Bangkok,   This particular scheme will not cost the-Exchequer anything as a larger sum has been realised by thesale of the old legation,  The expense however falls on1923/24 although the money was received this year.     Excluding this exceptional item,  the provision for hewWorks shows a reduction of  179,530 or over 15$.     further reductions may be possible on Several sohemss notyet examined by the Treasury, of which the largest itemsincluded in the sketch estimates are -and, generally^ to the extent to which your other suc-coramitteesmay reoommend reductions In the activities of particularGovernment Departments, it will be possible to effect further savings on the Building Votes in January.admiralty Chart Factory 48,600Ministry of Labour   Training factories 25,700The sketch Estimate, as submitted, showed a reduction on the estimate for 1922-23 ofand the further reductions recommended inthis report amount to    563,483300,000making a total reduction in 1923/24, by comparison with the original estimates for 1922/23, of 863,483          Rates on Gove rament.Irop erty.The expenditure in recent years on this Vote has been -

Of this  decrease  20,000  is  in  respect of expenditure borne on  the  extraordinary budget and   241,348 on the ordinary  budget.       The possibilities of reduction  on  this Estimate  are  entirely dependent upon  (l) a reduction  of the  poundage of  rates &quot;levied by local autho . ities, and  (2) the  surrender of  accommodation occupied for the public  service.       llo further decrease  can be  made at present. The precise  provision necessary can only be  determined on  the basis  of  the fuller information which will  be available  when the  final  Estimates are being prepared.

It assumes a triple form, viz:-          Ci) that the agricultural industry  in  England should              receive a sum  of  850,000 spread over  a  term of              five years as  its share in the   1,000,00- promised              for Great Britain.         (ii) that in addition, normal expenditure should              continue at the rate prevailing when the Act was              passed.                                               (iii) that
        dii) that aftex the axpijrtation  of the  five  year&apos;s              peridd in 1927, a considerable-a^ual  expenditure              (say, roughly,  135,000 per  annum)  should  be             - voted, for the eohtihuahce  of the ..spe-eial...service^.             . inlt fated-under ( i )i     -The. first of these three propositions&apos; is hoi in dispute.,The- third -via/have -no&apos; hesitatIon lh: re jeeting.   The Agricultural-industry were, promised not a permanent annuity  but a speciallump - sum: to. be spent over - a short&apos; term: period.  While we do not wish&apos;to&apos;lay down - an - ab s olute rule  and while some  allowance mustbe made. for the circumstances of particular cases, we think thatbroadly speaking if the koaistry  desire  to set  up a  service whichwill: not have terminated&apos;in 1927j&quot;they should set apart  from thesum&apos;  of  850,000 (which it shiuld&apos;be&apos;noted   has  already beenissued from the Exchequer) a:sufficient  endowment to providefor  it.      VVith  regard to the second proposition, we feel more doubt.The  intention appears t* have been that  the agricultural industry should receive a sun Of  850,000 not  in  excess  of what.it was actually receiving at the time, but  in excess of  what it would otherwise have received-.  It is relevant to observe  that thenormal expenditure at the -time the  Corn  Production ^otS  wererepealed stood at a high level ahd it seeiis difficult to contend that the Ministry of agriculture was  to  be safeguarded from thepossibility of reductions such as  were being made in all otherDepartments of State-.  vshile, hvrwevar, we  have  felt  bound to record our agr?ement with the Treasury on  the principle  involved and  do n&quot;t  think that they ehould  be  debarred from asking f%rreasonable  reductions by the Government&apos;s  pledge, We fully appreciate the practical difficulties of parrying this view intoeffect and we think that there is not  enough money involved tojustify raising the trouble which  the Millstor  of Agricultureassured us would be caused.
3*   Vve wish to place on record our view that grants in aid of developinents which are of direct financial benefit to theagricultural &apos; in dust ryV e,g* tho Bull&apos;and Boar and LI lkRecording ochemcs, should be kept within moderate limits andthat every effort should be made to bring Into being Associationswhich will enable the Industry to help itself.     &quot;ve have also come across a certain number of cases inwhich State assistance was justified, at the tine when schemes were being launched; but in which :we think &quot;it desirable thatnotice should be giveh in due time that State Assistance cannot continue indefinitely and that the schemes must become self-supporting a.ftbr the initial period has passed,       A memorandum by the Ministry of Agriculture indicatingwhat steps can be taken  to reduce expenditure on schemesfinanced from the &apos;-Uevelopment Auad for the development ofagriculture is attached as Appendix A to our Report,  It shouldbe observed that certain of these grants are made direct to theInstitutes concerned and do not appear on the Estimate.4.   Land Settlementy     It will be remembered that the total capital sum approvedby Parliament to  be expended under the Land Sett 1 ement,-Actsin England and Wales, was  20,000,000,  *s the result of thereport of the Ueddes Committee, it was decided that the limit of capital expenditure should be reduced to  17,000,000,     Vve are informed that for some time, the Ministry has&apos; beenrevising the County Council Schemes of equipment, cutting downbuilding programmes and insisting that properties or parts of properties expensive to develop shall be sold.  The effect ofthis review is that the total of the so-called &quot;commitments&quot; ofLocal authorities is approximately  15,300,000 compared with 15,400,000 In November last, though in the meantime additional land has been acquired/and provision made for the settlementof more men.

The Ministry regards the first of these schemes a3vital and necessary.  The National Institute is the essentialintermediary between research workers,  such as ProfessorBiff en, who produces new varieties of wheat,  oats etc.,- and theseed trade which supplies the farmer after the commercialvalue of a new variety has been proved.  The Institute withits farm has been established at a cost of&apos;some  35,000 (ex-eluding the Official Seed Testing Station) of which  13,000has been lent from the Development Fund..  If the maintenancegrants necessary on the crop improvement work of the institute during the initial years are  refused, the work ofthe Institute will be stopped or at least greatly hampered,and one of the most hopeful avenues for the improvement ofBritish crops will be, prc/tanto, closed.           The experimental work in agricultural machinery isof special importance at the present moment when the depressionin agriculture and the high cost of labour (high relative tothe prices which the farmer is receiving for his produce)are likely to turn the fanner more and  more to machinery.           The Ministry/hopes that provision will be made forthe continuance of both the above schemes.           The schemes classified under Head ,7G&quot; as less im-portant are the foilowing j-

Milk Production on arable land-           These small demonstrations have hardly yet had a      fair opportunity, and while the Ministry does not of course      regard them as equal In importance to the National      Institute of Agricultural Botany, it suggests that it      would be premature to stop them immediately* ,  In this      case also it would be glad to discuss with the Develop-      ment Commissioners the question of fixing a time, limita .(c)    The Lactose Factor?/ Demonstration,  has not really had a      season&apos;s trial yet. -  It has been proved within the last      month that lactose of a commercial standard can be pro-      due ed from wheyj but the plant has not had a fair      seasonrs running and the Ministry is strongly of opinion      that it would be a great mistake to scop the experiments      before the end of the season of 1923*   It is, however      willing to agree that after the end of that season no      further subsidies from Government funds should be asked,      and that the factory should then either be sold or,, if it&apos;      is continued, - continued, without an annual subsidy0(d)    The  500 for Tobacco Experiments will not be spent this      year and the Ministry does not now propose to ask for      it next year&apos;.

It isunderstood from the Development Commissioners that it is a contingency item in the event of any demand for a piece of research work coming from the Ministry during the course of the financialyear.  There would be no objection if the Development Commissionersdid not renew this item.SHELL-FISH INVESTIGATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF CASTLB BAM.          In considering the shell-fish expenditure,  especially for the purpose of comparison with future years,  it will be more convenient to ignore the figure of  4,700 given by the DevelopmentCommissioners, si^ce it only includes recurring maintenance charges,and to take the figure of s!55700 given in the Estimates (1922-3)          The details of the figure of  .5,700 which does not.include the cost of the Scientific Staff can be found in the-Estimates.   As against this sisn there are estimated receipts inrespect of cleansing of mussels at Conway and at  Lympstoneamounting to  2,200,  leaving the net expenditure - apart fromScientific  Staff - at  3,500,.   Ou  provisional Estimates  for nextyear show estimated expenditure of  2,180,  apart  from the  cost ofthe Scientific Staff.  Against this must be sot estimated  receiptsin respect  of mussel purification  1,400, leaving the net  estimated expenditure for shell-fish work - apart from the  ScientificStaff - at  780.          The Ministry regards the shell-fish work as essential and the amount devoted to it - as will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs  - is small.   Moreover,  it should be noted that  fairlysubstantial capital sums have just  been spent on  building  tanksfor mussel  purification at Lympstone;  on tanks for Oyster                                                  /purification

No objection would  be raised by the Ministry if theDevelopment Commissioners saw fit to reduce the grant to Port Erin to  700.  . A-t the same time,  the Ministry considers that this  station should be kept in being by means of a grant from the development fund,  and is of opinion that  a grant of  700 is the minimum for the purpose,UNIVERSITY C0LT.EG-B OP rfALBS.__ .300.          No objection would  be raised if the Development Commission ers were  to vithdraw the grant to the University College of Wales.          With regard  to the two foregoing items,  it is considered that bo\;h these  Institutions should  have  an opportunity of stating their, case to the Development Ccmmissioners before their grants are reduced or taken away.                            &apos; 10 &quot;&apos;             /(II)

The West Cornwall Fishery Loan Committee     administers a loan of  6,000 in all from the Development     Fund for the installation of motors in fishing vessels.     The loan is repayable in 1926.  A grant  of about  65 is     made annually to the Committee for their administrative     expenses.  This grant cannot very well be stopped.

The cost of schemes for Education and Research inScotland prior to tho Com production (Repeal)  Act was  143,50%da tails being set out in the sttched statement (Appendix A)  *The services included under this head were financed in  pastyears partly from the Board&quot; s Tote, partly from the  Agriculture(Scotland) Fund and partly from the Development Fund.       V/hen a grant of  150,000 was allocated to the Boardfrom the fund of  1,000,000 provided for agricultural education and Research under the Corn Pruduction Acts (Repeal)Act 1921 a situation arose similar to that in England on whichwe have commentad in eur Report on tho Ministry of Agriculture(para. 2 ).   It was contend vl by the Department that the
    150VQ0 fkmust &quot;be: additional to-o-ilij t,-i.2^^   on agricultural development.-    By agreement with the Treasury   however certain reductions were effected In the. existing   expenditure, (which was taken as  154,555 for ly21-22) and a &quot;datum   line&quot; of normal expenditure on agricultural, services, was fixed -  at  143,500-  It was arranged that the Corn Repeal grant should   ho expended over five years and that meantime the existing level   of &quot;normal&quot; expenditure should be  maintained-4.         As in the case of the similar grant  in England (para,   2  of Report on Ministry of Agriculture) we consider that there   is no justification for the assumption by tho Department that   after the end of the five year period the Government will be   committed to the continuance of so homes initiated with the   aid of the  150,000 grant.    We think that  broadly speaking   if the Board desire, to set up a service which will not have  -terminated by 1927 they should set apart from the  150,000   a  sufficient endowment &quot;to provide  for iti          In the course of our discussions the  Board offered   to consider deferring the progress of expenditure from the   Corn Repeal grant where it may be  possible  and economical   to do so  and we urge that steps should be ta&amp;en to this end., .5.         We have considered whether, the normal expenditure   of  143,500 should not be further  reduced;   but in view of   the pledge given to the agricultural community and bearing   in mind that certain reductions ware effected when the   &quot;datum line&quot; was fixed we see considerable  practical diffi-   culties in making further economies in this direction,,  Wo   think however that the pledge should not preclude reasonable   economies being made if opportunity offers.6.                        Agriculture  f Scotland) Fund.          we desire to draw attention to the considerations   advanced by tho Geddes Committee (p. 42 of  Second Interim                                                      Report/
Report) regarding the administration of the agriculture(Scotland) Fund.  The  150,000 grant under the Corn Produc-tion Acts (Repeal.) Aot has been paid into this Fund which hasan annual income of not more than  185,000 of voted moneystogether with  15,000 from the Scottish local Taxation Account.In addition to  15,000 annually for ten years has been providedby the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act 1919 for improvingCrofter Housing.       This fund is administered by the Beard on the authorityof the Secretary for Scotland and expenditure is not shownoh the Estimates or subject to Treasury control.       We consider that the expenditure of the Fund should b$confined to Land Settlement and Crofter Housing leaving theexpenditure for general agricultural purposes to be votedannually so that it Is subject to direct Parliamentary control.                      Land Settlement.            The total capital sum approved by Parliament to be expended under the Land Settlement Acts in Scotland was  3,500,000.Following the recommendation of the Geddee Committee it wasdecided that the limit of capital expenditure should be reducedto  3,000,000.The &quot;figure given to the Geddes committee as the emeurt of the so called &quot;commitments&quot;                   of the Board at tho end of 1921 was                      2,666,252By the abandonment of certain schemes this figure is now reduced to                                 2,409,751Schemes no?j in view will involve a further expenditure of about                                       200,000making a total of about                                  2,600,000                                                             We/
We understand  that this total of expenditure will not bereached for another t?jo years..       In view of the magnitude of tho loss on ScottishLand Settlement which was recently commented on by thePublic Accounts Committee we consider that every effort should be made to restrict expenditure on tho schemeand to weed out applicants.  In particular we attach importance to  the maintenance of the priority to ex-servicemen and to the limitation of new schemes as far as possibleto tho Highlands where settlement is much less expensivethan in the Lowlands and whero the demand is more acute.       We understand that the Board accept this view and they have  agreed that they will not spend or commit themselves to spend in excess of a total capital limit of 2,600,000 without resubmitting the question to the treasury for discussion in the light of the situation then prevailing.We recommend that this course should be adopted.

     But in view of the very complicated finance involving the Agriculture (Scotland) fund and the Development Fund;as well  83 of our recommendation in para. 6 above, our finalfigure must be regarded as provisional only and we recommendthat a further examination of the expenditure from this vote and from the Agriculture  (Scotland) Fund should take place before the Estimates are finally, passed in January, and thequestion of the extent of the balance required to be kept  onthe Fund should then be again examined.     As we have pointed out in para. 10 above,  31,500 ofthe savings which we recommend depend upon legislationbeing obtained to enable the Board to borrow from the capitalsums available for land settlement, in order to meet certaincompensation payments which have hitherto fallen as a finalcharge on the Agriculture  (Scotland) Fund.-17-

Included in the Sketch Estimate for 1923/4 is a newItem of  15,980 for a supplementary grant to the MarineSuperintendence Fund.     We understand that the annual statutory paymentof  15,000 from the Local Taxation Account to this Fundtogether with the miner receipts from fines, etc., is insufficient to meet the cost of the fishery protectionvessels maintained from the Fund.   &quot;e are informedthat In spite of every effort to obtain economy theDepartment estimates that this  service can only bemaintained on an efficient basis at present cost ofwages and upkeep at an expenditure of about  30,000per annum.     It appears, however, that from the reserve fundaccumulated, during the war there will be a balance of 25,000 remaining on 31st March 1923.   r&apos;e considerthat this reserve should be utilised for upkeep duringthe coming year and this sum together with the statutorygrant of  .15,000 will render assistance from theExchequer unnecessary in 1923/24.   The position after that year should be further considered.2.   ?-e consider that there is further scope for economy ton this Vote.     The cost of the administrative staff which was                     -19-                        only/
only  14,160 In 1913/14 is put at  35,644 for 1933/24.The latter figure shors a decline of  1,041 on 1922/23but, as the sut&apos;.or.mtic saving on bonus is about  1,700,it appears that the provision for Salaries is increasedby nearly  700.,   Tie think that a reduction should beeffected here..     Since the Sketch Estimate was submitted, the FisheryBoard have informed us that it may be possible later to effect a saving  of  200 on travelling and they are prepar-ed to agree to a reduction of  300 on the sum of  8,970sSovra in the  Provisional Estimate for Fishery Research.     The grant in aid  of Harbours  ( 2,000) while no doubtdesirable does not  appear to us essential and It may inour opinion be susceptible of reduction.     In these and other directions we  think  that the beard should  be  asked  to effect a further net reductionIn  the Sketch Estimate of  2,500,     As regards  the  services financed by the DevelopmentFend we consider that  a saving of  1,000 should be made by reducing the  provision for some or all  of the followingservices                                     Provision in Sketch                                         Estimate.                                           -  r*     Grants to independent institutions    300     Lobster  Culture                       835     Oyster Culture                        650     Salmon Fishery                        500Accordingly we recommend  that  the net  estimate of  the fishery Board should be reduced  from  65,779 to  47,299and that expenditure recouped  from the  Development fund should be reduced from  10,300 to  9,300,&quot;    the sketch EstImato-  as  submitted showed  an increase of 13,529 en the est Dilates  of  1922/23  but under our recommendations  It will show by comparison with these estimates a reduction  of  5,151,r-20^

The Vote for this Department for 1922/23 was reduced to the figure recommended by the Geddes committee but only by reducing the provision for stores, an economy which cannot be repeated and which partly explains thesmall further reduction in 1923/24.     Actually there are economies,  mainly on pay, of 19,546 but they are nearly absorbed by an increase of 9,000 on expenditure for stores and a decline of 7,950 on receipts from sales.2.   The staff, excluding part time workers (I.e.Office Cleaners) and including artificers no?/ numbers1,090 as compared with 2,077 in 1913/14.   No extensions of service are now being granted and the staff is beingsteadily reduced as opportunity offers.   An assurancehas been given by the Department that this policy willbe continued until a strength of 1,000 is reached.-   Itis hoped that this will be effected by the end of 1923/4.3.   In all the circumstances we consider that satisfac-tory steps are being taken to secure economy and we areunable to recommend any reduction  on the sketch estimate,ORDNANCE SURVEY.

The Committee on National Expenditure recommended that theoperations of the Commission should be brought to an*  end.

The increased liability arising from the development schemes is estimated at    2,000  per annum.                   -     With regard to the Grown Woods we understand that for thecurrent year the expenditure charged to the Land  Revenueis approximately    i....... .   ...      72,900while receipts are estimated at Li   ...   .__68.,900leaving a deficit of      ......   ...   ..  ,,,4.000We are informed however that the la rgest item of  receiptsis Forest Produce  45,100 which is  dependent for realisationon the state of the home timber market and is unlikely tobe reached,5.   The Sketch Estimate also makes no provision  for any pay-ments which may have to be made to  Northern and  Southern ireland on tho division of assets of the Fund.  The contingent liabilityon this account may be roughly estimated at  10,000
 6.   On  the other hand the Sketch Estimates provides a sum of ^20,000 for advances for affores- tation in 1923/24.  This item is susceptible of reduction;  and in any case the Commission have agreed that this expenditure will not he required if any money is allocated to the Commission from the Vote for the Relief of unemployment in the coming winter. 7.   A final decision hardly a--ears possible at, the present date but taking all the circumstances into consideration we think that for the moment we may treat the items mentioned in paragraphs 4-6 as balancing each other and we. accordingly recommend that a grant in aid should  be made to the Forestry Fund for 1923/24 of  163,000, being a reduction of  44,000 on the amount of  207,000 originally estimate
                  Development fund.1.   The Development Pund at the present time consists of two distinct parts.     (1) The &quot;new fund&quot; consisting of the   $50,000 allocated to the English Ministry of Agriculture from the -21,000,000provided for agricultural education and research under - theCorn production Acts (Repeal) Act 1921.     (ii) The &quot;old&quot; fund which was formed as the result ofthe Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909.   Thetotal issues to the Pund up to the present amount to 2,900,000.   A sum of 21,000,000 was voted in 1920-21 hutby agreement with the Treasury was not issued to the Pundon the understanding that parliament would be asked to revoteit in 1922-23 if required.2.   The &quot;new fund&quot; stands by itself and has been taken intoaccount in the Report of the Sub-Committee on the Ministry ofAgriculture.   The &quot;old&quot; Pund is the source from, which expenditure is found for various purposes tending to theEconomic development of the United Kingdom.   Grants from thefund are made by the Treasury on the recommendation of theDevelopment Commissioners either to Government Departments when the expenditure is shown on the gross votes for theDepartment and is recouped by appropriations in aid from theFund) or to institutions and societies direct.    i3.   The balance of the Pund will have been reduced to about  200,-000 by 31st March 1S23 against which Ireland has a claim to a sum which is not expected to exceed  153,000.4.   As matters stand at present the Development Commissionershave to meet recurrent expenditure on continuing schemesamounting to approximately  200,000 in 1923-24.                                                         As/
     As regards--non recur^ent^exrpendi-ture it appears1 thatsome  400,000 has been spent in the last 2-jf years i.e.approximately at the rate of  160,000 a year.   There are various commitments in respect of non recurrent -expenditure as well as of recurrent&quot; -expenditure.5.   We do not recommend that the Development Commission3hould be discontinued or the Fund left to expire since weconsider that the Commissioners perform useful work in co-ordinating and scrutinizing schemes  of development involvingexpenditure from the Exchequer.   We consider however that inview of the financial stringency a stricter  standard rust beapplied by the Commissioners in future in recommendingexpenditure from the fund.   For the present no new schemes should be undertaken which cannot be regarded as. vital ornecessary to reap the fruit of past  development;  and nocommitments for future grants should be  incurred which cannotbe  fully met from moneys immediately available  in  the Fund.6.   We consider that undertakings given by  the  commissioners in  past times to recommend recurrent grants  from the  fund should be revised in the light of present  conditions  and thatno  avoidable expenditure&apos; should be  incurred  under  this head.          With regard to the  continuing  expenditure  from theFund, the Commissioners have  furnished us with  a classifica-tion of recurrent charges under  three heads:-              A. Vital and  necessary schemes              B.  Schemes which&apos; it  is desirable  to                  continue if  money  can  be  found.              0. Le s s imp o rtant  s chemes.

The Development Commissioners have put forward anapplication for a grant of  1,000,000 in 1923-24.          On the whole, we consider that for the presentthe Eund should be fed by annual or fairly frequent replen-ishm.er.ts and we recommend that the -grant to the Eund in 1923-24should not exceed  250,000.                        &apos; (intld)  R,S.H.

Salaries and Wages.       Since the submission of &quot;their -original -esi;imate-rtheBoard, of Trade haye  informed me  that the amount  taken for bonuscan be reduced by the sum of  5,.600.   The  decrease  in  salaries and wages is very little more than the automatic decrease inbonus alone,  A considerable temporary staff is  still employedin the Establishment and Statistical Branches  and I  considerthat the Board might reasonably be ashed to make a further reduction of   ,000 by decreasing these temporary staffs.       I am of opinion that renewed consideration should be givento the feasibility of amalgamating the library,  Statistical andTariff Sections with the separate similar sections in theDepartment of Overseas Trade,.Stanaards Department.       At present the yield of fees charged by the StandardsDepartment is only  350 per annum.   After communication with -the  Board of Trade, I consider that the fees should be increasedsufficiently to bring in approximately  1,000 per annum.  Inaddition, the fees to be charged under the new Measuring Instru-ments Bill, which is largely for the purpose of supervising petrolpumps, should, as far as possible cover the full expenditure involved to the Standards Department by that measure if it  is passed into lav;.jjfags^sg^ 0 Lai m s       I have considered the advisability of charging a feefor  the registration of Russian-claims but I agree with theBoard of Trade that the question of imposing such a charge shouldbe deferred for the present. .       Kb reduction appears to be practicable on the provisiontaken for the liquidation of services arising out of the War,, .
      The net total of the Vote, if the above recommendations are carried out, would be reduced by a further sum of  8,250.

Since this estimate was submitted the Board of Trade have informed me that the amount taken for bonus can be reduced by 5,200 but the total decrease is still approximately only thesame as the automatic drop in bonus alone.    It is admitted that reductions of staff can be made &quot;on vacancies arising&quot; but&apos;&quot;I consider that reductions of staff in this Department should be accelerated .   I accordingly recommend that, in addition to. thereduction of  5,200 mentioned, the Board should take stepsforthwith to reduce staffs to the extent necessary to effect an economy of at least.  15,000 on this Vote in 1923/24.   this reduction might I consider he effected as follows :-        7,000 on Mercantile Marine Offices        5,000 on Surveyors             j        3,000 on Registry of Shipping and Seamen.Pees. s       The Cabinet decided Is ef Shibmsuy that the MercantileMarine Offices should be made self-supporting and the Treasuryestimate that the total cost for 1923-24 of the Offices,  ex-cluding the Atlantic Ice Patrol, but including provision on otherVotes, will be approximately  140,000 on the figures furnished by the Board.   I desire to re-affirm the principle that  these offices should be self-supporting but I consider that it  wouldprobably be politic in re-imposing the fee for engagement and
discharge to fix it at its former rate  of   /-.    The  yield  ofthe new and increased fees should he  carefully watched, witha view to increasing the scale later  if necessary to  make the offices fully self-supporting.      As regards surveyors fees, the case for raising in revenue under that head a smaller sum than the full cost  to allVotes of Parliament of the Survey Service  as estimated for1923/4, viz:  272,780 (or approximately  264,000 if the staffreduction recommended above is carried into effect) is stronger than in the case of the Mercantile Liar in e  Offices, but Iconsider that if the Economy Bill becomes  law the Board of  trade should effect a complete revision of  the existing basis of  feeswith a view to raising the revenue to  200,000 in 1923/4.   Genera3 Lighthouse liund.       The Board of Trade include in their sketch estimate  asum of  45,000 as a grant to the General Lighthouse Eund in aid of the coot of the removal of war wrecks.    I recommend that this sum be reduced to  40*000, a figure the Board of Trade areprepared, to accept.       Assuming the Economy Bill becomes law in its present formand the above recommendations are carried  into effect, the  nettotal for the Vote as submitted can he reduced to  135,480.       The Sketch Estimate as submitted showed a         &apos;                  saving of ....  ....          ....    31,35       The increase of fees tinder the Economy        (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would be ...   250,000             other       And the/savings recommended above are  ....     25,200       Making a total reduction, by comparison                 Wivn 19  / YJd of  ....    ....   ....   305,935..

According to recent estimates however the income will he insufficient to meetthe&apos; expenditure&apos;on all Votes of Parliament by approximately 20,000 in the present year and also in 1923/4.     I recommendthat if, when the final Estimate for 1923/4 comes  to he  framed,it appears that the deficiency on the service as  a whole for1923/4 is likely to exceed  10,000, steps should be taken to revise the scale of fees sufficiently to mske the  services fullyself-supporting unless the Board of Trade cen convince theTreasury that further increase of  the, scale would result in  acorresponding loss of revenue. &apos;                 Ivlines, Depart merit Vote. -             1921/22  Het Estimate   211910             1923/23  Net Estimate   170284             1923-/24  Sketch Estimate    162560       The decision of the Government  last February was  thatthis Department should become  an  integral part  of the  Board  ofTrade, but no Stejp^ have&apos; been  taken by the.

Afurther  saving  of  2,000 per annum would  result  if the ministerialduties of the Department were  carried  out by one  of the  existingUnder Secretaries pf  the Bo-ard in addition to his other  duties,
as intended by the  Cabinet last  February, and subject to anyfurther representations the President  of the Board of Trade may desire to make I think that additional saving should now beeffected.        A reduction on the  Vote of  approximately  6,000 wouldbe effected if the above proposals were carried into effect,making a total reduction by comparison with 1922/23 of  13,724.6

Estimate-  325,450     A3 I have stated in the paragraphs dealing withthe Beard of Trade Yotej I think that renewed consideration should be given to amalgamating the Library\  statisticaland Tariff Sections of  the Department of overseas Tradewith Ufce corresponding sections of the Board of Trade.      I co,nsider that steps should be taken to devise a scheme which will ensure that a considerable share ofthe cost to the State of supplying information or ofrendering specific services falls on the individual firms to whom it is supplied by means of an annual subscription or otherwise.      I am impressed by the desirability, in present eir- cumstances, of extending the activities of the Department in certain countries within the j&amp;empire in which I am inform- ed  that there are relatively good prospects of obtaining an improvement in trade, but I consider that the increase  of expenditure involved should be offset by reductions in the staff already employed in countries in which trade has little chance of development, such as Austria, Greece, Hungary, and Switzerland.   I am not clear that three representatives of  the Department are required in Germany or two in Italy, nor that the immediate trade prospects justify the reversal of  the decision in connection with the current year!s estimates to abolish posts in Portugal and Persia and to reduce the posts in Brazil from two t o one.       Having regard to the large reductions which but for the new proposals  for extending the activities of                                                /the

The oohciusioa reached by the Cabinet last Feb-ruary was ihat no saving would result from the abolition ofthis Department^ as recommended by the Geddes Gommittee, andit was decided  that the/question of amalgamating it with someother Government Department should be deferred until itcould be dealt with in connection with a larger reorganisa-tion *f Government Departments, which it was felt wouldrequire to be taken in hand soon,      A further recent investigation of the staff of theDepartment by the Treasury confirms the conclusion that itsbreak up would not lead to any economy, assuming that its work (Railway Agreement Liquidation, Unemployment relief work, Road Fund management, permanent work imposed by theRailways Act, 1921) could not,be abandoned.   The surplusstaff employed on Railway Agreement Liquidation and Unemploy-ment Relief will be dispensed with when that work is com-plete.                            v      The view taken by the Geddes Committee was thatedonomy and efficiency would be attained if all the questions of transport by sea, rail, road and canal, and questionsof power and coal, were grouped in the Board of Trade underene parliamentary secretary to assist the President, asecond parliamentary secretary taking all trade questions,including Treaties and Tariffs, Patents, Bankruptcy, etc      I have already expressed my view that this pclicyshould be carried out forthwith as regards the absorptionby the Board of Trade of the Mines Department, but I harecome to; the conclusion that in present circumstances, wV-\:sthe Board of Trade has still to perform important -work
arising out of war activities the absorption of theMinistry of Transport as well as the Mines Department, isnot really feasible.      The only practicable alternative would be to estab-lish a Ministry of Communications whi eh would naturallyinclude the post Office and the Ministry of TransportsBut the control of questions relating tfc sea commuhicationscould not be transferred to such a new department, and more-over the post Office and the Ministry of Transport are bynature very different departments.   The Postmaster-Generalis a great employer of labour, whereas the Minister ofTransport should occupy an impartial pcsiti^n on labour questions arising between the Railway Companies and their employees.      I have therefore come to  the conclusion that atthe present time there is no real alternative to continuingthis Ministry on its present basis.       2.   Since the Sketch Estimate was submitted, Ihave been informed by the Ministry that it is now hoped to recover from the Amalgamated Railway Companies during1923-24 the sum cf  55,000 in repayment of the expenditure incurred by the State on the Railway Amalagamation and railway Rates Tribunals.  This will enable the net totalof the estimate as submitted to be reduced by that amount.      3.   The Ministry of Transport represent that theprospect of inducing the local Authorities to take over responsibility for Ramsgate Harbour, Menai Bridge,Caledonian and Crinan Gan&amp;ls, is remote, particularlyso in the case of the Caledonian and Crinan Canals.    In&apos;the circumstances I am not prepared to reduce at presentthe prevision included for these services in the  sketch estimate, but I propose to consider in January next,                          Jo-

As the State&apos;scontributions to the Unemployment Fund are a proportion ofcontributions.,  any  decrease in unemployment below an estimated -average of 1,250,000 persons or I0.43f of the Insured populationfor 1923-4 would result in an excess

        The figures given, below are/throughout exclusiveef army allowance for cost of living reduction.        Detailed criticism hy the Treasury of theserevised eDtrcaal.es led to the Ministry offering a further reduction of  2,141,000, end 6n the estimates coming again before us we have felt justified in increasing this sum to 4, 285,, GOO *    The reductions offered by the  Ministry and thefurther reductions recommended by the Sub-Committee are shownin the statement below. In the main these reductions do not involve any new economies but are the result of closer estimationTwo matters call foa? special mention:-        (I)  A reduction of  40, 000   in the cost ofadministration Is contingent on the adoption of a system of half yearly life certificates for pensioners in place of thepresent quarterly certificates..  It is proposed to make thenecessary  changes in the next Appropiation Bill.        (II) If the full reductions of    500,000 and  738,000respectively recommended in the revised. Estimates for the Costof Treatment and Treatment Allowances are to be realised it wJ.llbe necessary for-the Ministry of pensions to overhaul theirpractice in regard to the grant- of treatment to pensioners witha view to ensuring that treatment is only given where thedisability is  the result of v?ar .service, that it is of a character suited to the disability and is not unnecessarilyprolonged *  We are greatly impressed by the large;numbers ofcases  still under treatment by ,the Ministry 4 years after theArmistice, Unless these show henceforward a considerable andsteady reduction at least equivalent to the reduction we havemade in tho Estimates,  the whole question should we think bethe subject of an expert enquiry.

In view of the uncertainty as to trade prospects for1923-24 it is difficult to forecast traffic so much as months before the commencement of the financial year, but forthe purpose of the estimate the post Office have assumed a5% increase in volume of business over 1922-23..   A lump sumof 5320,00C, has been included in the estimate for the addition-al staff that would be needed to handle the increased business and a margin for possible increased requirements of stores etc.has been included under the various subheads.       We think that provision for increased expenditure onthis account need not be included in the present sketch estimate.   The question can be reconsidered towards the close of the present financial year and the Estimates readjusted, ifnecessary, on the fuller information then available.   If theadditional staff proves to be neceasary there will be a morethan counterbalancing increase on the revenue side of thebudget.

the average Increase this year over the 1921-2 figures is nearly 11,4$*       The Geddes Committee expressed the view that onthe 1921-22 volume of postal Traffic a 5% reduction in out-door and indoor postal staffs could be effected.   Reductionsamounting to over  % have in fact been made since August 1921but the improvement in traffic is now rendering further re-duct ions more difficult.   The Post Office view is that substantial further reductions in staff cannot be looked foron the basis of the continuance of existing postal facilities in full, and of the present organisation, hours of work and output of the staff.       The postal facilities now available are substantially less than before the war, and the monetary effect of  the curtailment, amounts to  538,150 per annum without bonus.No substantial further saving could be effected unless itwere decided to abandon the daily delivery of mails in theremoter districts of the country..       As regards organisation we are assured that thepossibility of effecting economies on this score is kept undeconstant review..   The monetary effect of the steps takensince the war to improve organisation-,, to increase the use of mechanical appliances and to eliminate non-essential  checksand processes is stated to amount to  960,750 per annum,without bonus.       Negotiations ?nave taken place recently with, the employees&apos;&apos; associations with a view to securing the adoptionof a higher standard of output for.manipulative work  in the postal and telegraph services-.   An Improved rate of sortinghas been agreed but it is not considered by the Post  Officethan any immediate saving can be produced on this accountsUltimately the effect shotxld be appreciable,., either by                                              enabling/
enabling the existing staff in large towns to be reduced asvacancies occur or by securing that an increased volume oftraffic will be bandied without a corresponding increase in staff..,       We are informed that the question of the relationship of staff to volume of traffic is under close and detailed consideration by travelling Committees. -       We&apos;consider that in course of time a substantial reduction in the cost of staff should be secured from thevarious measures which are now being taken by  the  Post Office.       On the facts available at present we do not recommendthat the provision for staff in the Provisional estimates should be reduced beyond the amounts offered by the PostOffice.   Before the estimates for  192-3-4 are  finally settledhowever, the question should be reconsidered in the light  of later  information as to the actual  expenditure  incurred in thecurrent year.Engineering Programme ( Subheads 1K.- L.- )       The provision in the Provisional Estimates( 6; 195. 000) requires to be increased by  95COO in respect ofthe Imperial Wireless Chain, consequent on a recent government decision regarding the Indian station, and. to  be reduced by 250,000, the latter being a general reduction offered by  thePost  Office on  reconsideration of the Estimateso       We have  been  furnished with  an allocation of this expenditure *       Telegraph  construction requires  350,000 of which 200,000  is for the  Imperial Wireless Chaiiic    A large part of&quot;the remainder is merely in respect  of continuation servicescarried over from 1922-23,.       Renewals and  rearrangements  account  for  2.020,000  ofwhich   1,73.0,000  is  for Telephones,,                                             ?.1aintenance/
     Maintenance accounts for  3,470,000 of which 2,840,000 is- for Telephones.     Repairs of stores in Factories account for  303,000of which  270,000 is for Telephones,     -/e understand that the estimates under the last three categories must De regarded to some extent asconjectural and that until more detailed particulars become available later in the year it-is not possible to say whetherthe figures submitted do or do not include a margin for expenditure which is optional but: not essential-,   We considerthat the point should not be lost signt of and that a further examination of the Engineering Programme should be made at alater date with a view to effecting any reductions possible,,Telephones?     The Post Office Engineering programme is governedto a considerable extent by the development of the telephone service which is now taking place,   Expenditure directlyrequired for telephone expansion is however provided fromloans and not from tho Post Office Vote,     The probable requirements for 1022 and 1923 are about  16,000000,   Whilst a reduced rate of expansion maybe looked for in the future the&apos;telephone service is weunderstand showing satisfactcry results from the revenuestandpoint and this being the case it is not desirable forthe present to curtail development provided that the necessarycapital can he found without detriment to the national finances generally,     The capital borrowed from the National DebtCommissioners is repaid at present by annuities having aperiod of 15 years.   Our attention has been drawn to the/fact
          fact that the period of the annuities is considerably less          than the average life of the telephone plant and it has been          suggested to us that the period might,, in present conditions          of financial stringency, be lengthened to 20 years.  We          understand that technical evidence is available affording          full justification for the longer period.               As regards existing annuities the National Debt          Commis si oners as trustees for the Savings Bank and other          funds which have lent the money, could not properly be          asked to agree to an extended period of repayment0  Indeed          a necessary corollary would be the raising of the rate of          interest in respect of the pre 1916 annuities contracted at          low rates.               As regards future annuities we think that the 20          year period, which is not in excess of the statutory maximum          under the Telegraph Actsj should be allowedc   On the          annuities created in April next in respect of expenditure in          the calendar year 1922 the annual charge would be reduced          by approximately  120,000 and a reduction to this extent          would be possible under subhead M0 of the provisional          estimate.          Conclusion,               The total of the Provisional Estimates  51,769,000 is          reduced to  51,243,000 as a result of savings agreed with          the Post Office,,   3y eliminating- the provision for increased          traffic  320,000 for staff can be deducted.   By extending          the period of repayment of Telephone Capital annuities           120,000 can be deducted from subhead h.               The vote will then stand at  50,803,000 which total          should, we think, be adopted subject to possible variation          at a later date on the questions above mentioned in this          Report,J*y Chambers, S.W.

The Sketch Estimate shows a reduction of  563,797 or21*35/0.   It is calculated that the reduotion in the requirements of the public service for stationery and printing is 309,297 or ll-g$u   The remaining reduction is due to thefall in wages in the printing and binding trades, the fallin the price of paper, the reduction in the bonus of CivilServants etc.2.

As the result of representations by the  Treasury the stationery Office have agreed to a reduction in.their estimate for Administration by  34,912.       As regards the remainder of the Vote,  the figures  pro- .posed have been examined, and - it is considered  that certain further reductions may be found possible when the actualestimates for 1923-24 are in preparation in January.   Themain factor.on which this Vote depends is the level of wages in the Printing Trade.   This appears to have reached a con-dition of temporary stability in the provinces, but up to  thepresent time the London printing firms have not succeeded intheir negotiations with their employees.4.     State Printing.-  Criticisms have recently appeared inthe Comptroller .and. Auditor General^ Report, and in thePress on the Trading Account of the Government PrintingFactory at Harrow based on  two points - (a) that the accounts
at Harrow showed a loss of  32,839 on a turnover of  161,674;(b) ti at work is assigned to Harrow at prices above those  atwhich it oould be placed by accepting the lowest tender in the open market.       The matter may be further referred to by the SelectCommittee on Publications in their Report for last Session,which has not yet appeared.       The Departments reply to these charges is -       (l)  the loss referred to was incurred in the periodJune 1920 to March 1921, i.e. the initial nine months of thework of the Factory.   It is a common experience in enter-prises of this kind that the troubles attendant on theirlaunching produce bad results at the start.       I am informed that a smaller loss, possibly  20,000on a  200,000 turnover will be shown for the twelve monthsMarch 1921-March 1928 *       The monthly Progress Returns for the first 4 monthsof the  current financial year are however stated to show a profit  on a commercial basis.        (2)  The period in question was one of quite abhormaldifficulty in respect of  ( a)unexampled depression in the printing trade - it is believed that many private firms havedone even woa?se -  and (b) a very great reduction in thevolume  of Government printing as  a result of measures ofretrenchment.        It is frankly admitted that if the full effect ofthese adverse factors had been foreseen  in 1920 the experi-ment of a Government Printing &quot;forks would probably not havebeen undertaken at that time.        f3)  Work is given to the  Harrow factory at a pricerepresenting the average oost of  such work if put out to. thetrade.                                                     (4) On/
(4)   on special jobs,  e.g,  the Telephone Directory,which can be undertaken only by. &amp; small circle of. very bigfirms with specially equipped works, the. advantage, of aspecial Government, press in preventing rings is important,and is believed to have already effected considerable eoonomy.       The arrangement under which the Harrow works were taken as a Government Printing Factory provided that thereshould be an, experimental period of three years., after whicha decision should  be taken as to whether to continue or to stop.   This experiemntal period terminates in JuasThe approximate out-turn of the commercial.account-for thecurrent financial .year fiiould be known in May or June nextyear, and I recommend that an enquiry by a - committee intothe future of the Wo3*ks shoizld.be put in hand by that date.Unless it is clearly shown that the period of heavy lossesis definitely past, .an.&amp; that there  is a. good prospect of profit in the future, I am of opinion that the experimentshoiiid be dropped.   .. ,,(Sgd)Ho S.
