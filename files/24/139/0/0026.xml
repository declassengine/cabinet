[THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITAMIC MAJESTY1 S  government);..     Report by Sir Samuel HoareBt,   C.M.G.,  M.P.___(Circulated by the Secretary of  State  for the  Colonies).      I went over to Ireland for two purposes, firstly to discuss with the Provisional Government questions connected with the refugees and the big problem of compensation, secondly to consulta number of representative Irishmen upon the general politicalsituation.   As I am discussing the Refugee and compensationquestions In detail with the Colonial Office, I am concentratingthese notes upon the general political situation.      The Provisional Government are doing their best in Dublin.As to their efforts in the rest of the country I will say a wordlater.      With the exception of Cosgrave, the Ministers have neadministrative experience.   The reins of Government have not been handed from one class of trained administrators to another classof trained administrators, they have been handed to m&amp;n whose solequalification &amp;v their present posts is that they took a leadin the guerilla movement against the British Government,   Thismeans that apart from Cosgrave they know little or nothing of theconduct of affairs.   Cosgravo, who was the most honest and efficientmember of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, is theonly one of them who has had practical experience of administration.      In the Provisional Parliament, which I attended, they andthe Speaker showed a complete ignorance of the ordinary rules ofParliamentary business, v/hilst in the field of administration theyhave no trained Civil Service upon which to fall back for theknowledge that they do not themselves possess.   The british administration has come to an end, and there has not yet been timeiECRET.CABINET.CP.4526.POSITION OF THE IRISH PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.
for an Irish Civil Service to take its. place.    British, public,opinion, therefore, must bo prepared for many^nisiakes and-deljayB*son the part of the Provisional Government,   Cosgrave told me verycandidly that owing to the inadequacy of their machinery theywould take ten times longer to do things than would be nodded bythe British atministration.     There seemed to be the&apos;, general .feeling; that Cosgrayo with his administrative experience upon the Dublin Corporation wouldbe much more likely to overcome these difficulties than Collinswith his cinema and star turn attitudinizing.     Moreover, the members of the Government have each of theman embarrassing past from which it is difficult to escape.Whilst none of them seem actually to have been gunmen, all of them,particularly Muleany, fought and suffered with the Irregularleaders.-,   Collins at any rate could never  escape from this feeling of comradeship with his nominal enemies and the small number of casualties up to the time of his death is due to hisunwillingness to kill his friends of yesterday.   Even now, thedividing line between Free Staters and Irregulars Is  often blurredin the country districts.   Both sides have equally looted inthe South and West.   Members of the same family, although in .different camps, seem to feel no resentment for each  other,   Ata fight at Lough Gill although brothers were fighting uponopposite sides, there was no feeling in the  district, still lessany attempt at reprisals, when some of the wounded were shot  onthe ground by the  Irregulars.   A company of Free State recruitsrecently marched out of the Curragh and  joined the Irregulars.   a senior British Officer was assaulted In a Dublin guardroom by a free State Officer, who made no secret of his unchanged Republicansentiments.   Behind theso Incidents the background between thetwo parties Is still further&apos; blurred by the fact that Mrs.Ohildersand Mrs. de Valora still  live unmolested in their Dublin  houses,whilst the military censorship, strict enough for the Free Stateand the British press.,, left &quot;The&apos;Irish Re nub lie&quot; untouched in                              -2-
the strests of Dublin.     All this leaves an uncomfortable feeling in the mind of thelaw-abiding Irish citizen that the Froe Staters and theIrregulars arehand in glove with each other.     I  arn convinced that, if the Provisional Government is tosurvive, those doubts must be removed.   As long as the Governmentseem to be playing with the Irregulars * they arc in imminent danger of the fate that overcame Kerensky in Russia.   At thepresent time all the propertied classes of Ireland  are againstthe Irregulars.   The whole of the press, Dublin and local., is against them.   Every Roman Catholic Bishop is against them.None the less, if uncertainty continues, public opinion will jumpto the conclusion that the Provisional Government are shilly-shallying and that nothing is to be gained by supporting them.     It is most important, therefore, that the Provisional Govern-ment should In the course of the next few weeks show that theymean business and that they h.-&quot;.ve power behind them.    . By this time I mean that they should make a really groateffort to wipe out the Irregulars- in the immediate future.  -Thereare probably not more than 2,500. organised Irregulars under arms,.But behind tho organised force  there are thousands who drift tothem when things are going well for thorn.   That public opinon as a whole is agaiiiist them is shown by the fact that there isplenty of intelligence available from informers as to theirwhereabouts.   But have the Provisional Government any concerted   for wishing them out?   If they have a plan,plan /have they enough men to succeed with it?   This seems to meto be the crucial question.   Unfortunately it is very difficultto estimate the number of men in the Free State ranks..   Kulcahyand his assistants are very secretive on this point.   I wouldguess it to be not much more than 15,000, although I-  sm aware It.Is put as high as.30,000.   Assuming-that it is 50,000 Is this number sufficient when it is remembered that the men are practicallyuntrained and unof.floored?   I should feel much happier If the
 Provisional  Government made a national appeal for many more recruits, and  if  this  recruiting was not mainly restricted to the old Irish Volunteer crowd.,         The Provisional Government have everything to lose by drift,  the Irregulars everything to gain by it.   As things are now the  Provisional Government are undoubtedly strengthening their position in  Dublin  and the neighbouring counties   Colonel Johnson, Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, confirmed to me the general feeling that, although sporadic firing goes on most nights and money is still being extorted by gunmen from shops and offices, law and order is gradually being re-established in Dublin Itself. My own view  is that things will continue to go better in Dublin, for there at any rate the Government, Parliament and the Constitution will be in visible being.  Put if the Provisional Government is to be a real Government, its writ must run outside the boundaries of the capital.,   All the  information that I could obtain went to show that in the South and &quot;&apos;estP particularly in :r&apos;est Cork and Ferry, the state of the country is getting worse and not better.   Moreover in these districts the irregulars can play upon the inf lammable material ofN agrarian discontent.   Refugees&apos; from ^erry, where it should be remembered Childers is installed, declare that the country is in the hands of a peasant revolt and that the revolt is not being led by the young men, who form the backbone of the irregular movement in other districts, but by the old men who remember the agrarian movements of the last generation.   Unless the Provisional Government can  stop the landslide that is going on, the South and the South^est with Cork as its centre will drift either into complete anarchy or into a peasants republic   And the Provisional Government willnot have the least chance of stopping the  landslide if they have not sufficient men in the &quot;free State Army,
        Apart from the  actual fighting there  is the  equally important question of  the maintenance of  civil order,   For  , months past there  havG been  no police, no magistrates  and no courts in the  country  districts,   The Provisional Government are  in the  act  of  appointing stipendiary  magistrates for the country and of  setting up Free State courts  in Dublin  Castle. They have also  enlistod  a police force known as the Civic Guatd for service  in and outside Dublin.   It is said that the first detachment of Civic Guards are going into the country this week.   They  are  men of very fine physique and are turned out  in a smart  uniform very  like our Air  Force iuiiform0  Un- like the H.I.C. they will be  a purely civil force end will not  be  armed with  rifles.    The men seem  to me to be an excellent type, but everywhere I hear doubts as to whether they are adequately trained.   I cannot help thinking that if they are to  succeed, their work should be supported by local Civil  Guards in the villages  and country  towns.   Several people  emphasised this point  to me5   They seem to think that the  priests would be ready to lend a hand in the raising of these  local forces.        The Provisional Government are quite right in emphasizin the  oivil character of the Civic Guard by not giving them rifles.   The greater  the contrast between the Free State and                                                      that the  British regime the less dangerous will be the charge/theFree State Government  is really the British Government under another  name.   This being so, it is doubtful whether theProvisional Government are wise in forming a body ofAuxiliaries under the name of the C.I.E.  at Oriel House *These men to the number of about 150 are used for tho same kindof jobs  and in much the same kind of rough and ready way as we                                                        used/
the Auxiliaries.   Moreover they have the additional drawbackthat thoy are not in uniform.     I believe what is wanted, both for the army and for thepolice is a national appeal by the Government for -the help of all men of good intentj whatever may bo their political records.Such an appeal would give heart to the propertied classes andwould prove that the&apos;Provisional Government is no longer theexecutive committee of Sinn Pein but a National administrationrepresenting impartially the forces of law and order.     This is the first stop for the Provisional Government totake.   The second is to clear up with as little delay as possiblethe great mass of personal grievances that now exist against thepresent regime.   As long as there are thirty or forty thousandcitizens who have claims against the British and Irish governments for damage to person or property, so long will there be an opensore poisoning, public opinion and eating out tho life of theProvisional Government.   If these personal grievances can be gotout of tho way, the Provisional Government can then stand on theirown merits, uncompromised by the complaints and attacks of thousands of embittered individuals who have lost their property ,or who have been personally injured.   On this account I cannotemphasize too strongly that in  the interests of the ProvisionalGovernment these claims must be speedily settled..   Cosgrave agrees with me completely upon this point and I hope to put up to theBritish Government a proposal acceptable to the ProvisionalGovernment and myself, for expediting in particular the big bodyof claims covered by the Shaw Commission.   Under the present arrangements the Shaw Commission will take thirty years to wind up its work.   This delay is intolerable to the claimants and is extremely dangerous to tho. stability of any Irish Government.The Shaw claims must bo wiped, off in the next twelve months,and tribunals at once set up by the British and Provisional .Governments for wiping off- without further delay all other claims1
that do not come v/itliin the Shaw Commission reference.   Tocomplete the settlement of personal grievances the BritishGovernment must simultaneously with the passage of tho Constitutionpass an Act of Parliament completing land purchase,     By this means a great body of personal discontent will beremoved and the Provisional Government loft unhampered to carryout their immediate duties.   Moreover by proving their willing-ness and ability to settle tho claims of the political opponentsthe &quot;Government will make clear to  the doubters their  intention tocarry out thedr obligations and to  act as the representatives ofthe Nation,,21st September 1922.
