D. 11. 30 p.m.   September 26th 1922.       R,  5,4 a.m.    September 27th 1922. No.415.     Your 997 Personal for  C.N.S.     Detailed p3.ans on the  lines you suggest for naval artillery support  of  military operations onIsmid Peninsula already  exists vide Mediterranean No. 887of May 7th 1922 which has been brought up to date butthe whole of the situation  is  altered by refusal ofFrench and Italians to co-operate and the Maltepe-Dodulu line cannot be held.    General Officer Commandingdoes not intend to offer effective resistance to advance on Ismid, but to evacuate if attacked in force,and return to Gallipoli, since It is impracticable to conduct war from the enemy&apos;s capital.    He will notwithdraw his forces for  political reasons until the attack takes shape which there are not signs at presentras the Nationalists hesitate to attack Ismid becauseof the danger of alienating French and Italian sympathyby certain massacres that would take place in the townand other contingencies.    With the land force gonenaval action by gunfire  and aircraft spotting will have little effect other than a  (?  limited) delay of nationalist advances a delay which will be minimisedby the fact that the Turks  move by night.   Furtherunsupported naval attack will undoubtedly provoke                                            reprisals
reprisals against the unprotected Christian populationox the town who are in a highly nervous condition.A complete organisation exists in Constantinople forarming large bodies of Turks and the infiltration ofundesirable elements by train and ferry from Asia isuninterrupted.   Many of these men are undoubtedlysoldiers.   Nothing can be done to prevent thisshort of isolating Asiatic shore from European.   It is with the foregoing in view that I do not considerthat Nationalist penetration Into Europe can be pre-vented once the military leave Ismid and that I donot recommend leaving a squadron in the Black Seawhich could serve little purpose.   If the Turksmean business the only sound policy is to retire onDardanelles and if military operations become necessaryto conduct them from there.   The Navy would remainin control of Marmara and (&apos;? Mediterranean) coasts ofAnatolia and Thrace and this with the severancerailway communication beyond Bulgaria should producestrong pressure on Turkey.   It is proposed to mountall guns coming from home in Peninsula which willrequire strong counter battery fire.&apos;   GeneralOfficer Commanding concurs fully with the views ex-pressed in this telegram.
