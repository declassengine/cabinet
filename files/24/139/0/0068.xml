DOCUMENT IS THF PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) 3 4 I  4269 .               CABINET .                  AGRiOJILTURAL POLICY.\ (Hem6rian^ffl^pjr.;:;th^ M^fttoffeyv of Agriculture. and Flshor-ioe).\  The memoranda which I have already circulated were, as I have lained,  not considered statements, but merely a series of suggestionsle after conversations with the Prime Minister, Lord Milner and others.iwhatever view may be taken of them by the Cabinet, I must impressmy colleagues the absolute necessity of taking steps to relieve thetuation without delay.  With regard to the proposal for a temporary subsidy, contained in second memorandum (attached to C,P.4261), I realize that the demands being put forward by the miners render the positicn very difficult.may well be argued that it would be impossible to give a subsidy toriculture and to refuse one to the mining industry 0   Apart from this,lave always seen the strong objections to a policy which made agricul-re dependent on subsidies, and for the Government to revert to aisidy policy, even temporarily, after having abandoned it last year,ild open it to much criticism.   I am convinced that nothing short ofubsidy,  or the imposition of a tariff, which I believe to be politi-lly impossible, would really meet the present emergency, but in view the objections mentioned above I do not propose to press the proposal.  &quot;If we  reject the subsidy policy we must, however, take some immed-to steps  to ease the sitation.   At the present moment, the Nationalsiers 1 Union are considering whether they will not re commend theiriibers to lay their land down to grass on an extensive scale, which willin the dismissal of many labourers,   They also threaten to recommends in wages down to about 25/- a week or even less.   If they knew,ever, that the Government was going to help them, not with promises&quot;the future, but with measures immediately, they might be persuadedtake a more reasonable line, even though cur proposals were only in tho
 nature  of  palliatives.   I  suggest,  therefore,  that we  should  intre- duce  and pre3s  through  In  the  Autumn Session two measures which would bring considerable relief.  The first is a measure  for dealing with the  rates  on  land.   The second is a measure  to  give assistance by means of  Government loans to those farmers who  in the years  following the Armistice bought their farms largely with borrowed money, many of whom are now in great difficulties.   They have a  claim on us since they were  certainly led to believe  in many cases that the  subsidy policy of the Corn Production Acts was to be continued  for some years.        As  regards the rates, landowners, farmers and labourers are agreed that some relief is urgently required.  A remarkable  document w the subject has just been drawn up by a Committee consisting ofj representatives of the Central Landowners Association, national Farmers&apos; Union, National Uni*n *f Agricultural Workers and theII Workers&apos; Union, and submitted t* the Prime Minister, urging thisI reform.  It may be objected that accupiers of   land have already had relief given to them by the Agricultural Rates  Act, 18:96 , by which they only pay half the poundage.  But the rise  in the poundage since i then coupled with the  fact that the  Treasury  grant made tc supply theI deficit was a  fixed grant based en  the  poundage  of 1895 , has resulted1 in the practical loss  of the advantage  then conferred, and farmers1 are teday paying infinitely larger  amounts than they were at thatj time.  Apart from  this, however, the half  poundage basis still resultsI In the farmer  paying at a much higher rate  in comparison with his profits than any other class, since  he  is  compelled to occupyI a much larger  amsunt of rateable property  in  order to earn his living.   I will take a simple example.   A farmer with  200. acres,j assessed at  200 lives close by a small shop-keeper assessed on his shop at  36.   Their profits are probably  just  about the same on the average, but if the rates are 1C/-  in the  pound, which is less than the average in country districts, the farmer  is paying in rates  50 a year, and the shopkeeper  15.  This is a condition  of things which is quite indefensible.  In a memorandum by the  Chancellor of
the Exchequer on the &quot;Present condition of Agriculture&quot;  dated the10th March,  1922, in reply to my memorandum,  CP.  3788,  March 1st,;922, on the same subject, it is stated on page 7  that  &quot;if we werestarting with a  clean sheet to devise  a scheme  of  local  rating there ould be much to be  said on grounds  of rough  justice  for relieving  the armer altogether of rates on his fields leaving him  only liable  for ates on his home and farm buildings.   The land has,  however, been urdened with rates  for  some 300 years and this liability has operated o  reduce the value  of it  both on a  capital and on a  rental basis.  Toi very large extent  therefore the rate liability is in the nature of  a ent  charge  on the land  and in this  respect resembles tithe.  In  fact ad rates remained stationary in amount there would have been no  more ase  for relieving the land from this  burden  than  from the liability  to ithe or land tax.  Unfortunately, rates have increased  rapidly in feoent years and as  regards this increase it  must  be  admitted that  the listorical justification of the heavy  charge  upon  the farmer breaks own&quot;.  Later on, on page  8, the Chancellor says:  &quot;In these xircum- tances, I should not regard the proposal of  the Minister of Agriculture p  reduce the rateability of agricultural land  to  one third&quot; - the figure I had then suggested - &quot;instead of one half, as unduly generous&quot;. j n  page 9 he suggests that if the proposed Valuation  and Rating Bill ere  passed, it  would not  be unreasonable to  fix the  uniform abatement in  agricultural  land in  rural areas  at 75$.         I  propose  that we should Introduce  a  very simple measure  amending- I he Agricultural Rates Act.  We should provide  that in future occupiers f  agricultural  land should pay quarter poundage instead of one half. he deficiency should be made up by  a  Treasury  grant  - rising and  falling ith the-poundage.  At the present time, this would cost the Exchequer ccording to the calculations of the Ministry of Health  about  2,800,000 [year for England and Wales, and the  relief  given to the farmer  would p  on the average about  2/6 in the pound.  There is good authority  for iis  proposal.  The  Act  of 1896 was  based on  the Report  of a Royal aramission on Agricultural Depression  which recommended  that agricultural ind  should  only pay quarter- rates in  the future.   The  Government of
the day, however, were not prepared to go so far as this and proposed a reduction to half only.  The reduction to a quarter wouldbe a substantial he/ip to farmers and would remove an old-standinggrievance, but evea so they would be paying on a higher&quot; scale thanothsrA rate-payers, :having regard trj their earnings.  The bill shouldalso provide to extend the benefit tw farm buildings (as distinct from tho dwelling house).  For some unexplained reason the Act of1896 did not include the buildings with the land, though what use thebuildings would be without the land It is Impossible t$ sea.  Thiswould not be a big matter financially, but would givo great satisfaction.  Theso changes need not in any way affect a generalreform of tho rating systom which *s lo,ng overdue, but would place the rating ef agricultural land and buildings on a more equitablebasis.        The ether proposal which I make is that either by a Stateguarantoe of Ifans %v by   State loans tho Government should &quot;come tothe aid of those farmers whe have  ought their farms since thoArmistice.  Many of these men are in great difficulties since theirmargin ef security is disappearing owing to the fall in tho value pfland and the Banks aro, therefore, pressing fgr the repayment oftheir loans.  No doubt most pf these men bought In order to preventeviction when the estate was sold, but  &quot;many were doubtlessinfluenced by gur premise of assistance to the industry, which was subsequently withheld.  The ampunt of mpney involved is not verylarge, and a scheme cp,uld fte worked p,ut by the Treasury and theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries.        In conclusion, I would press an the Cabinet the necessity cfdealing with these proposals as a matter of urgency as I cannotundertake to hold back the farmers  from causing a  serious crisisunless an announcement of practical assistance is  made in the very near  future.                                           A. G.  B.9th October, 1922.
