ACTION TO  BE TAKEN IN  REGARD  TO  CONTRABAND            IN EVENT OF RESUMPTION Off HOSTILITIES  WITH                             TURKEY .        Memorandum toy  the President of the Board of Trade.      The letter  of 1st October from  the  Admiralty which. haB been circulated  to my colleagues  (CP.4248) raises two issues, viz.,  as to the  form  and extent of the contraband list in  the event  of a  war with Turkey,  and the  area over which the right of viBit and search should be  exercised.     Put Very  briefly my view  is  that no objection need be taken to the re-adoption of the very long  contraband  list of 1917, provided that  the  right  of search  is  only exercised in some such limited area aa  is indicated in the  seoond sentence of paragraph 3     I  would remind my  oolleagues  that the contraband list, which was  comparatively  short  at the beginning of the late  war, grew before  the  end of  it  to  one  of enormous  length, which included such peaceful  articles as cotton piece goods.  It  is  therefore of the highest importance that the main  ourrent of  trade to the East via  the Canal  should not be interfered with by unnecessary liability to search and detention.     I recognise the practical advantages of an unmodified list, and I do not therefore wish to urge any revision so long as the area in which legitimate trade can be submitted to harassments, delays and Inconveniences is very strictly limited.   If,  however, the area of search were to be seriously extended I  should feel obliged to press for a substantial modification of the list soas to include only goods of direct military use.                                      (Intd.)  S.B.3rd.  October, 1922.
