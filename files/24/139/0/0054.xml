THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT),P. 4-354.            .      0 A BINE T.PROPOSED ADVISORY PINE ARTS COMMISSION.        Memorandum by tho First Oommissione r of l?orks:.           I am strongly pressed from influential quarters to establish an advisory body analogous to the Pine Arts Commission which has acquired an unrivalled status and authority throughout the U.S.A.  In 1920 Lord Beauohamp&apos;s Committee on the existing Ancient Monuments Acts recommended the formation of such a body, and at conferences summoned by the Presid.ent of the Royal Academy a general scheme has been formulated.  Personally I have always been apprehensive of a Ministry of Fine Arts, and even were such an organisation desirable the&quot; moment is quite inopportune.           The American Committee Is an honorary body nominated by the President, which operates in the District of Columbia, including Washington, a city without an elected Municipality. It controls the plans of all buildings erected, within its jurisdiction, lays down the lines  of town-planning  and. development, advises upon the style and location of monuments,- supervises the design of medals coins and currency  notes, and, in fact, covers the whole range of art matters in which the Federal Government is concerned.   Gradually this body, set up by Congress in 1910, has earned a  reputation so widely recognised that its advice is invoked from all parts of America.  The total annual cost, including travelling, printing.  &amp;c., is about  2,000.                                                      An
          An advisory body in this country would be serviceableto Civic authorities and. to State Departments which from timeto time are concerned with constructive art matters,  (as opposedto the administration of Museums and. Galleries),  It would, haveno statutory powers, though later on, if justified by success,such powers might be conferred., as was the case in America,  Itwould be necessary to provide an office - two or three rooms at most - together with the right to draw upon a pool of type-writers .  The annual cost would perhaps amount to  1,000 a yearto start with, and might possibly amount ultimately to  2,000a year, to cover salaries, rent, office outlays and sometravelling expenses,          I ask authority to announce that the principle ofsome such scheme is accepted by the Government, but I do not suggest a money vote during the next year or two0  It is,however, d.desirable that interested persons and societies shouldbe in a position to discuss methods and organisation, though will enter upon no commitment on behalf of the government without Treasury consent.          I may add. that in my opinion, the better the advice atthe disposal of a Government and Municipal authorities, thegreater will be the economies in schemes where large  sums are too often wasted through lack of adequate foresight andcons iteration.                        (Intldo) 0. &amp; Bo                                qVth October, 1922.
