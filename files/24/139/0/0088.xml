OF THE EXCHEQUER^ SUB-COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE ETC *;JRET.         Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.p. 4289.          I am sorry that I nust take the strongest exception to onerecommendation contained in the Report of the Sub-Committee on national expenditure (E (C.S,)8, page 2 attached to CP, 4270), with regard tothe expenditure of the sum of  850,000 which was provided foragricultural development by the Corn Production Acts (Repeal) Act,1921, as part of the arrangement then made with the farmers,          I may say in passing that there are some bbservn.tions in thesecond paragraph on that page v/hich I cannot regard.as accurate, viz.,the statement that &quot;the intention appears to have been that theagricultural industry.should receive a sum of  850,000 not in excess ofwhat It waa actually receiving at tha time but in excess of what it-vould otherwise have received&quot; and the remark to the effect that thenormal expenditure (for Agricultural Education, Research, etc) at thetime the Corn Production Acts were repealed stood &quot;at a high level&quot;.But I need not pursue these matters, as the Sub-Committee accept in substance my contention on the point discussed in that paragraph.  Atthe same time^ however, they preface this acceptance by a recommendation&apos;]which renders It valuelessj and.it Is on this recommendation that I desire to concentrate attention, viz., the proposal that if the Ministryof Agriculture desires to set up a service which will not have termlnat-ecin 1927 they should set apart from the sum of  850,000 a sufficientendowment to provide for itc          I cannot possibly agree to this recommendation for thefollowing reasons:-     (a)  Less than a year1 ago the Treasury deliberately  and                                                                         i     formally abandoned this proposal, and agreed to another     arrangement.  In their official letter of the 21st     December, 1921, they wrote as follows:-  &quot;While My
Lords do not propose; to insist that permanent endowmentsshall be set aside out of the new fund for all continuingservices  financed therefrom, They cannot contemplate theimposition of a heavy additional burden on the national finances as a result of the&apos; new fund after so short aperiod as 2% years:  and They.consider that the fund shouldbe so expended over a period of not less than five  years from the 1st April next as  to&apos; throw no additional charge upon the Exchequer until the end of that period&quot; .   (b)  A change from this&apos;five years-&apos; basis to that proposed by the Sub-Committee of course involves a mostdrastic reduction of the programme which, on receiving the Treasury letter, I drew up and have proceeded to execute; it moans in effect cutting it down by three-quarters .  I could not accept such a change.  Some of theschemes in my programme have been officially approved indetail by the Treasury, and their execution has begun..  Onmost of the schemes -which have not yet been officially-approved in detail my officers and I myself have had muchdiscussion and negotiation with Universities, ResearchInstitutes, Agricultural Colleges, Local Authorities, etcc,preparatory to the submission of definite and agreedschemes to the Treasury,&apos; and we have of course dealt withthe Institutions and Authorities on the basis that we canspend the new money in five years, as we were authorisedto do by the Treasury letter quoted above.  As I told theSub-Committee, it is morally Impossible for us now toabandon that basis.  Our position would be really hopelessin face, of the disappointment of the Institutions and authorities, their resentment at the waste of time and effort, and the conviction which would naturally bo borne in upon them that it is useless to make arrangements withthe Ministry of Agriculture because the whole basis ofsuch arrangements may be upset as soon as they are made-,                      2,
         The Sub-Committee&apos;s proposal is quite impracticable,,  if         any regard is to be paid to past pledges and to considera-         tions other than financial^  (c)         The expenditure now in question, though formally         voted by Parliament, Is balanced on the Estimates by a         corresponding grant from the develop ment Fund:   and,         therefore, whether it be large or small, adds nothing to         the net sum which Parliament is asked to vote,.    The         proposal of the Sub-Comm.! thee would not reduce  by one         penny the net amount whioh. the tax-payer will be asked         to provide during the next four years,  (d)         Agriculture is passing through a great depression.         I submit that this is not a time to cut down         expenditure on Agricultural Education and Research         to which the Government is solemnly pledged and. to do so         by throwing over a Treasury undertaking given less than         a year ago5 on the faith of which we have incurred actual         and moral commitments to Institutions and Local         Authorities all over the country,,         I am. not asking for more money., nor do I ask that anypledge be given that when the new fund is spent the exchequer shallbe bound to finance the continuing schemes then in existence.,    I askmerely that I shall not be precluded from initiating schemes whichcannot be permanently financed from the Corn Repeal monies -  andthat when the five years; period to which the Treasury Lave agreedcomes to an end. the continuance of each scheme then in existenceshall be considered on its merits, with- due regard to the positionof the national finances and. of .o^;ucultu.rb.* *n otlrer words, T askmerely that the arrangement to wliioh the Treasury formally agreedten months ago and which the Cabinet approved six months ago shallnot be now repudiated and upset.                                           ii.
