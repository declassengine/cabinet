I desire to submit the following for the         consideration of the Cabinet                                          IAN MAGPHERSON.          MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF PENSIONS.          The Royal Warrants of December, 1919,  and July, 1920,provided for the grant of increased rates of pension to meetthe increased cost of living.  The chief rates thus givenwere:-     (l) a maximum pension of 40/- a week (together         with an allowance of 10/- a week for a  wife)         in place of 33/- for a disabled man;     (2) a pension of 26/8 a week for the widow  of 40,         or a widow of less than 40 with young children         In her care, and 20/- for other widows;and smaller increases on certain other classes of pension.In accordance with- the decision of the Government, theseincreased rates were stabilised for three and a  half years,and the Warrants provide that no reduction shall take placeif the cost of living falls, until after the end ofMarch, 1923 J          The increased rates of pension were fixed at atime (September, 1919,) when the index figure for the costof living was 115% above the Index figure for the pre-war year.It is not, of course, yet known what the index figure for theyear 1923 will be, but it is estimated that it may be about 85,If advantage were taken of this fall in the cost of livingto reduce the rates of pension, a reduction of 12i$ (-gth) to14$. might be made In April of next year.  There  are,however, in my opinion, substantial reasons which makeIt inadvisable to carry out such a reduction at  thatdate.On
          On the merits of the case, I do not considerthat  2 a week can, under present conditioiosf be consideredtoo high a rate of compensation for the Nation to pay ascompensation for a man totally disabled by war service,    nor do I think that 26/3 for the widow who is past work, or isprevented from working by having the care of young children,is at present an excessive pension.    With the heavilydiminished purchasing power of money it represents no more thanthe 16/6 a week which a widow drew in pens ion.four years ago.But there are more urgent reasons than the mere merits of thecase against a reduction of pension rates next year.          The decision of the Government in 1919 to stabilise the increased rates of pension for three years, was adoptedsimply for reasons of administrative convenience.    TheSelect Committee on Pensions, whose recommendations were Ingeneral accepted by the Government, had recommended that therates should be fixed annually in accordance vrith the cost ofliving.    The effect of stabilisation has, however, proved to thefinancial disadvantage of disabled men and other pensioners,since the index figure for the cost of living rose steadilyafter the Government^ decision was taken, until in November, 1920,(i.e., 14 months after the increased rates- of pension had been fixed) it was 176% above the pre-war figure, and it did not againfall to 115$ until October, 1921.    Indeed, the average indexfigure for 1921 was 125t8, and during the present year thec-ost of living has shewn only a comparatively slight decline.I feel, therefore, that were the Government to take advantageof the first occasion when the fall in the cost of living admittedof a reduction in the rate of pension, they could, not withoutjus tification
 justification, be accused of having derived considerable advantage from the three years&apos; settlement at the expense of pensioners.          But even if the reduction of 12^% to 14% were justifiable in itself, I do not think that effect could safely be given to it so early as April of next year. The probable future course of prices as affecting the cost of living and the purchasing power of money, is dependent on such a variety of conditions as to be incalculable with any accuracy, and I understand that some rise in prices is a prospect quite as possible as a continuance of the recent fall.    At the presentmoment, however, all that is clear is that the rate of reduction in the cost of living has very considerably slowed down, since during the past seven months the index figure has only varied between 79 and 88,    If full advantage were taken of an Index figure of, say, 85, to reduce pensions by 12%%t and prices should rise In 1923 to any appreciable extent, there would undoubtedly be serious complaint.    In my view, no reduction in the rate of pension can safely or justifiably be made, except to such an extent as will still allow of some increase taking place in the cost of living without making the pension rate Inadequate to meet the reduced purchasing power of money.    A 12-g-j , still. less a 14$, reduction in the rate of pension, leaves no such margin if the index figure for 1922 should be in the neighbourhood of 85,          Moreover, in my view It is essential, on general grounds, not only that no reduction should bemade in the rates of pension until there Is a substantial margin left for a possible increase in thecost of living,  but that if and when any reduction Is to be made, It should be made once and for all,    The                                               terms
                                                     &quot;4 if terms  of  the Royal Warrants contemplate  the  possibility of an  annual revision of the rates of pension  in accordance with the cost of living, after March,  1923, subject,.however, to a minimum rate of pension.     The administrative inconvenience which would.be  involved by an annual revision would be extreme, and in  my opinion it must be politically raost undesirable  to create an impression Of uncertainty In regard to rates of pension If advantage,were taken of the present fall  in the cost of living, the .12%% or 14% reduction which might be made in April, 1923, would still (under the terms of the Royal Warrants) leave a margin of further  possible reduction If there were a further fall In the  cost  of living.    When, If ever, the further fall will take place  is, of course, a matter for the future, but the uncertainty attendant on such a possibility  is highly disadvantageous to the administration of pensions. In my  opinion,, it will not be safe to take advantage of the cost of living to. reduce the rate of  pensionuntil the index figure has fallen well below the stage at which, under the Fens ions Warrant,  the fullreduction in pension rates allowed by the Warrant canbe made,          Finally,  I would point out that the expenditure of my Department has for the last  two yearsshewn a very substantial decline, namely from 106,000.000 in 1920-21 to about  05,000,000 for thepresent year (1922-23), and the decline is continuingand will, as far as can be foieseen,  be maintained during next year,     Even according to present indications, and on the best estimate  I can form ayear in advance,  I do not anticipate  that theexpenditure of the  Department will exceed 76-g- millions
for&apos; the year 1923-1924.    This decline, while due in part to such natural causes as&apos; the improvement&quot; In health of pensioners, the elimination of pensioners from the pension roll in consequence-of death, the re-marriageof widows,, the cessation&apos; of allowances - to children asthey out-grow the allowance age, etc., Is also to agreat extent due to administrative action in thedirection of mere careful investigation of claims,improved medical administration and a reduction of the clerical establishment.    The stricter administration.which has been instituted for the last 18 months has produced. Inevitable grumbling from  many sides.    TheMinistry is, on the one hand, freely, charged witheconomising at the expense of the pensioner, and, onthe other hand, is being pressed to admit new classesof case to the benefits of the Warrant,    In my view,the policy of the Ministry must be, while dealinggenerously with the disabled, to resist with courage the attempts to enlarge the legitimate area, of the Minis try !work.     This policy must of Itself mean great and continued, reductions in expenditure year by year.    Butthe work of the Ministry In this direction will be seriously hampered if an automatic reduction in therates of pension affecting every-single pensioner is determined on in circumstances which&apos; do not carrypopular conviction that such a reduction, is fully-justified,    I see grave danger that if an attempt toreduce pensions is made and defeated, either by theHouse or by the country at an election, the momentumof this victory for the ex-service men may sweep awaynot only any attempt at reduction of&quot; rates, but also those sound foimdations of our pensions system which are essential for its operation.    Such a course would                                                     involving
involve grave risk of a severe re-action against thewhole scheme of pensions administration which mightentail heavy financial consequences to the State.                     &apos;  RECOMMENDATION.          I propose, therefore, for the concurrence of theCabinet that no reduction should be made in the ratesof pension in April, 1923.          I may add that the terms of the relevant Articlesof the Royal Warrants which provide for an adjustment ofthe rates of pension in accordance with the cost ofliving, admit of the course of action I have suggestedwithout a modification of their terms,                                   I.  M.Ministry of Pensions.10th October, 1922.
