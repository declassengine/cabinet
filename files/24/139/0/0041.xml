The Earl of Balfour presents his compliments to  theSecretary to the Cabinet and, in continuation of his telegramNo. 34  of September 18th, forwards herewith a cow of a         f/memorandum sent to him by Monsieur Stambouliioky on the subjectof the Hear Eastern settlement in so far as it will affectThrace,2.    Lord Balfour had an opportunity today of talking withMonsieur Stambouliisky who said that the mixed population ofThrace would undoubtedly accept a proposal to place the country under the League of Nations in the same way as the Saar Valleyand Danzig are now.  It would be possible to raise locally a force of gendarmerie sufficient to keep order and the  country,which was thinly populated,  could be utilised, in order to  settlemany of the refugees who were now being turned out of  Asia Minor:3,     He said he hoped that the points for discussion with, theTurks which had been announced already in th press as  the  resultof Lord Curson&apos;s visit to Paris, were only preliminary bases for negotiations and that at the future peace conference thedesirability of setting up an autonomous Thrace would  be kept in view.  Ke repeated the arguments already advanced by one ofthe Bulgarian delegates in favour of avoiding a common frontier between Turkey and Bulgaria by the interpolation of a  district                                                       eunder the League of Nations, (see Geneva telegram JTo.  34 ofSeptember 18th) and. added that the great advantage to  Bulgariaof such an arrangement would be that they would gaint  without     X Appendix Io     p Appendix II     e Appendix I.                        -1,
further trouble with the Greeks, the access to the Aegeanthrough the port of Dedc Agatch, which was necessary forBulgaria.  The present communications with the Bulgarian ports in the Black Sea were v,ften interrupted by stormy weather andalthough it would cost a large sum of money to make Bede Agatcha suitable commercial port, he was confident that access tothe see. would contribute, in the end, to the prosperity of bulgaria,  He left with Lord Balfour a memorandum on this point,a copy of which is also enclosed herewith.-4.    He likewise suggested that it might be possible torender the river Maritza navigable from the sea to Adrianopleand place it under some sort of International body similarto that whichlooked after the Danube.5*    Lord Balfour promised that he would bring MonsieurStambouliisky!s remarks to the knowledge of the Governmentin London.,September, 193-2.

Lampoon of September 15th.           Bulgarian prime Minister has arrived at Geneva and sent      one of his delegates to impress on me desire of establishing      in Thrace autonomies under League of Nations.           Bulgaria he said did not want common (grp. oratd.) with      Turkey and felt that autonomous Thrace would be barrier      against Russian ambitions in regard to Constantinople,  Greeks      would also be gainers as being relieved from strain which near      neighbourhood of Turks would impose on them.           Emissary of Bulgarian prime Minister said that Turks      would be certainly willing to respect authority of League.           prime Minister is anxious to place these views before      Hr. Lloyd George either here or in London.
                      APIBEDLX  II.                         (I)        bent by mr  utambouliisky to Lord Balfour,                  23rd September, 1922 ^                                          Hotel de Eussie,                                              Geneva,slat ipn,                                            2nd oeptember, 1922.             As the  principal allied powers aie now exchanging       views upon the best means of restoring peace in a part of       the Near East, the Bulgarian Government, which has&apos; so       many reasons for being interested in the solution of the       problem, considers it a duty to make its views taown, as it       did when the  Treaty of Sevres and the convention of can Eerao       were being prepare cL  Without discussing frae. existing points       of view (these en presence), the Bulgarian Government, taking       note of what  the local situation demands, and animated by       the interests of peace, and a scrupulous impartiality towards       all the interests which events have involved,  is convinced       that the best means of getting rid of existing difficulties,       of securing an agreement amongst all persons and things       (facteurs) directly or indirectly interested in a  settlement       of the conflict, and, last but not least, of satisfying the       legitimate wishes of the populations whose future existence       is to be settled, consists in setting up an autonomous state       under the control of the League of Nations, comprising all       Thrace from the hinterland which would be left to       Constantinople, up to the Le eta.            An autonomous Thrace under the control of the League of       Nations would ensure the freedom of the  straits; and would       got rid of the objections to replacing the province under       Turiiish rule, as well as the other, equally strong, objections,,       grounded on principles of fairness and points of fact,                                                        against
against establishing Greek sovereignty in Thrace.  Finally,an autonomous system of government, under the control of theLeague of Nations, would meet the wishes of an immensemajority of the Bulgarian, lurk, and oven Greek population:Their wishes have been asserted more than once already, andwould, at this moment,  be expressed with even greater force,if the nativebora Thraclans wore asked to pronounce on theirown future under the freedom which would be assured to themby the Council of the League of Nations.     The establishment of an autonomous system of government through-out Thrace would,  moreover, dissipate the suspicions(unfounded it is true) excited by a projected settlement whichwould have given Bulgaria and,Turkey a common frontier.     buck are the general considerations which offer thebest guarantees for a durable peace, without conflictingwith the accepted principles of.. international law.  withregard to the particular interests of which it is the guardianthe Bulgarian Government things that an autonomous governmentin Thrace, under the control of the League of Nations, would secure the prosperity and national life of the Bulgarianpopulation;  would make it possible for those refugees toreturn, who  had been driven out of the province, by insurrec-tions, by war and all their consequences; and would giveBulgaria that access to the sea, which the prinoipal Alliedlowers admitted to be necessary,, and duly promised to her.

As a result of the Balkan War Bulgaria acquired an access to the open sea at Ledeagatch which started a new era in hercommercial relations with the other maritime countries,-     Through Ledeagatch Bulgaria could freely export herproduces and the foreign countries were in a very favourable position with regard to imports.-.     Within a very short time Ledeagatch. attracted a consider-able part of Bulgarian trade and very soon acquired greatimportance in the economio life of Bulgaria,-     The following figures illustrate in a vivid manner theimportance of the trade activity which took place atLedeagatoh during the years 1913, 1914 and 1915.

 of  facilities  at  a port  the  only  access  to which  is  through a foreign  country Is unworkable.   *.t  the present  moment so  many  difficulties exist both as regards despatch  of Bulgarian  commodities  and passenger traffic to  Thrace, that  Sulg      is  virtually deprived of moat of  her best and nearest  foreign markets.      On  the  other hand the Danube  route  which is  ice- bound in winter is unsuitable  for steady commercial  relations owing to the lack of ships and to restricted commercial navigation.      It  is unnecessary to insist  upon advantages  to  Bulgaria of  free  access to the  Aegean.  It is  enough to  point out that, whereas  she is now forced under the present circumstance to  trade mainly with Central Europe,  the possession  of an. Aegean port  would shorten her  communications with the Entente Powers by  about a thousand mileea      In  order  to  enable  Bulgaria  to recover her former-markets, to  assure her economic  development and thus give her the means  of,meeting her financial obligations  under tho Treaty,  one . should at  least  create favourable conditions  for the free expansion of  her trade       It  is therefore necessary that Bulgaria  should  obtain free  access  to the Mediterranean  countries that are  her &quot;nearest  and  most  natural, markets, the way  to  which  is&apos; through  the  Aegean Be a.\
