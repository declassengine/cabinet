&apos;,Thls Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majesty1 s Government-)SECRET.C.P.4276iCopy Wo.CABINET      Remuneration of the Law Officers of the                     Crown .      Rote by tho Chancellor of the Exchequer.          During the investigations of the Committee on theEstimates for Civil Services for 1923/24 the question of the remuneration of the Law Officers of the Crown was brought tomy notice.   The present position is not satisfactory and i accordingly direct the attention of my colleagues to thematter and ask for an early decision in regard to therecommendation I make in the last paragraph of this memorandum.           The Law Officers are paid partly by salary,  (fortheir non-contentious work) and partly by fees, (for theircontentious business)  based roughly on the fees which would normally be paid to a K.C. of average standing.            The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor for Scotlandreceive salaries of  5000 and . 2000 respectively, in each casewithout fees.             The Attorney General&apos;s salary is  7,000 per annum,and his total average remuneration before the War (1900 to 1913)was about  14,000 or  15,000 per annum, rising exceptionallyto nearly  20,000 in 1903-4-   The Solicitor General receivesa salary of  6,000 per annum, and his total average remunerationbefore the War was about  10,000 per annum rising exceptionallyto
to  19,000 in 1913-14-      Since  1913-1*  the remuneration of the two Law Officers has been  as  follovs:-Attorney General.Solicitor-General.1913-1*1914-151915-161916-171917-181918-191919-201920-211921-2218368.14704*12270.12943*14941.14693.26512*34990 *6*   6.13.  1.16*  0* 6.  4*12.  2.12. 11.13. 10. 9.  7.19037. 9725.114M * 9255*13618 *15581.15749 *18928.16. 8.12* 9.16* 9* 6* 5* 6* 0* 9.10. 3. 4. 6* 6*31000 (approximated16000  (approximate)          The salaries of the Attorney and  the  solicitor general were reduced to  6,0Q0 and  5*000  per annumrespectively during the War*   and their brief fees waremarked down by 25 per cent.   This arrangement  however lapsedearly in 1919.           The Select Committee on the Remuneration ofMinisters recommended (paragraph 13 of the  Report) that  thesesalaries should be reduced to  5,000 and  4,000 respectivelyoo the understanding that fees for contentious  businessshould remain.            If we were considering the assignment of  fixedsalaries to the Law Officers to cover their entire remunera-tion, it would be reasonable, bearing in mind  that  they  mustpossess the highest technical qualifications,  to assign  themsalaries in excess of those drawn by other Ministers  of corresponding
corresponding rank.   But the position is entirely different,  for as shown above the Law  Officers receivefees, many times as valuable as their fixed salaries,  asa result of the exercise of their technical qualificationsin contentious cases.            I accordingly recommend that the salaries  ofthe Attorney General and of the Solicitor General should bereduced to   5000 and  4000 respectively,  on theunderstanding that fees for contentious business willremain.   The change does not require legislation  and can be effected by Treasury Minute.                                     R. S &apos;H .TREASURY CHAMBERS.   12th Octobar, 1922.
