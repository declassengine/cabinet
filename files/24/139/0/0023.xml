ARTICLE 25 OF THE MANDATE ON PALESTINE.      LORD BALF0UR reminded his colleagues that Article 25 of the Mandate for Palestine as approved by the Council, on July 24th 1922, provided that the territories in Palestine which lie east of the Jordan should be under a somewhat different regime from the rest of Palestine,   The article read as follows           &quot;In the territories lying, between the Jordan and the      eastern boundary of Palestine as ultimately determined, the      Mandatory shall be entitled, with the consent of the Council      of the League of Nations, to postpone or withhold application      of such provisions of this mandate as ho may consider      inapplicable to the existing local conditions,.....&quot;The British Government now merely proposes to carry out this articlIt had  always been part of the policy contemplated by the League,accepted by the British Government, and the latter now desired tocarry it into effect.   In pursuance of the policy, embodied inArticle 25, Lord Balfour invited the Council to pass a series ofresolutions which modified the Mandate as regards those territories the object of these resolutions was to withdraw from Trans-Jordanthe special provisions which were intended to provide a nationalhomo for the Jews west of the Jordan.   The memorandum presented
by the British representative on the steps which the BritishGovernment proposed to take In order to give effect to Article 25was then read (Annex 421).      M. HANOTAUX stated that he was ready to approve the Britishmemorandum, on the understanding that in accordance with the explanations just given by Lord Balfour, it only aimed at maintain-ing in the area to the east of the Jordan the general regime of theMandate for Palestine;      The Marquis IMPERIALI was  also ready to approve tho memorah-dum subject to the decision^ taken at the meeting of the CouncilIn London on July 24th 1922, with regard to the  coming into forceof the Palestine  and Syrian mandates.      Lord balfour entirely agreed  with the interpretation of thememorandum given by M. Hanotaux  and the reservation made by theMarquis Imperial!.      The Council approved the memorandum of the british representative.&amp;   See C.P.4125.
