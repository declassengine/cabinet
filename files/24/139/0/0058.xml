British Delegation,                                                 Hotel Ketropole,                                                          G E IB V A.                   The Earl of Balfour presents his compliments to the         Secretary to the Cabinet and with reference to Foreign Office                       PIt        telegram No.35 of September 14, desires to inform him that therculated..         Assembly today elected as non-permanent members of the Council,         Belgium, Brazil, China, Spain, Sweden and Uruguay.         2.        It will be seen that no representative, of the Little         Entente was elected and it appears that the Powers forming the         Little Entente had agreed amongst themselves that the State         which should represent them on the Council if elected would be         the Kingdom of the Serbs Croats and Slovenes.   It became known         that, if elected, the Serbs would appoint as their representa-         tive the Serbian Minister at. Berne, Monsieur Yovano**itch,and        - there is little doubt that the personal unpopularity of this         gentleman had a good deal to do with the non-eleotion of his         country to one of the vacancies.,         3.        Br. Benes had let it be kno?/n %hat Cgechb-Slovakia         was not a dandidate,and in these circumstances the majority         of the delegations at the Assembly decided not to vote for         the Little Entente at all.    It turned out that votes which         would have been given to Czecho-Slovakia if there had been a         chance of procuring the services of Dr. Benes on the Council         were,  at the last moment,  transferred +0 China.         4.        The only new members of the Council, now that the         numbers have been increased to six,  are Sweden and Uruguay and         it is expected that they will appoint as their representatives         M.. . Bran ting,  Prime Minister and kinister of Foreign Affairs,         and ^onsieur Blanco,  Uruguayan Minister in Paris.1th September, 1922.I*x*   The Report of the First Assembly Committee proposing this increase        in the numbers of the non-permanent members will be circulated        shortly,
