Memorandum, by the Seoret&amp;ry bf state for Air.             With reference to the decision of the Cabinet on        1st October, I forward a statement showing what aero-        planes should be in the air during.the next  fortnight or        so, In place of asking for a dally return at  present  and        causing an overloading of the wires.   The details of        the returns are very technical and difficult  to under-        stand, even for:jan expert, ..and it, is hard to  say  what Is        a  serviceable, machine  as they are serviceable one minute        and unserviceable the next.   There  is also  the fact        that  one aeroplane may do two or three flights  in one        day,  then none for the next two or three, and then  start        flying again  for a fortnight or so;   and  in  view-of        General HarIngton&apos;s telegram to War  Office No.  2560  it &apos;; &apos;        is quite apparent that he had kept the neutral zone        under air  observation.

Of course the       dates on which msch*       ines become available       are dependent on dis-       embarkation facilities,       and the distance of theNaval  aerodromes from the       place of disembarkation,       which is not known.

I deprecate loading up the wires with daily serviceable returns.  This must  be  left  to  the  man on the  spot,    unless he complains cf shortage of Air, and it gives a misleading  idea, as  at  one time there  may be the  whole    of the machines available, and five minutes later only 50$.  They  should average,  however,  from 70$ to 75$    available.                                                                               (Sgd) H.
