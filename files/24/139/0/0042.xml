THE? COMMUNISTS              The Executive Committee of the Communist Party         of Great Britain decided recently to send e         strong delegation to Russia in November in order to         press their claim for a higher grading in the         communist movement:  the claim is not to be based         upon numerical strength but upon the &quot;rapid         development&quot; of the movement and the &quot;unique         position&quot; of communists in England:  the delegation         is to be composed of:                            Arthru MacM&amp;McManus                            William Gallacher                            Albert Inkpin                            J.T. Walton Hewbould                            John W. Leckie                            Harold Webb                            J.T.

Should any difficulty arise concerning passports,         it is the intention of the communist concerned         to have letters addressed to them on the notepaper         of Berlin and other foreign firms requesting their         presence in Germany on business matters.  Harold         Webb has been refused e passport.              Patrick Lavin i3 also to go to Moscow for         special work on &quot;terms suggested by the Comintern&quot;:         an allowance will be paid to his wife  during his         absence at the same rate as that paid  to the         dependents of other delegates or members of the         staff.              It has now been decided to hold the annual         conference of the Oorainunist Party at the Battersea         Town Hall,  Lavender Hill,  on October 7th and 8th.         Branches have  been informed that &quot;if there  are any         special  reasons... a  why eel?c&amp;tesT  travelling                                                expenses/
 expenses  should  be  remitted by headquarters in advance head- quarters  are  prepared  to consider the matter on an application: from  the  branch  concerned setting forth ^ic reasons.  In all caseSj however,  it  is  essential that the delegate fee be first.I paid.&quot;      A meeting- of the  Executive Committee held last week-end &quot;decided  that the divisional organisers should attend the con- ference and that their expenses should be borne by headquarters&quot;!      The  agenda  for. the conference is as follows:-      &quot;1.  Appointment  of Credentials Committee, Standing Orders!          Committee  and Tellers.      20  ChairmanIs opening address.      3.

that a considerable etna has been p^id for the printing ofHo.16 of the Communist International and that Albert Inkpin isnegotiating for the publication of No. 21 concerning which hewrote to a secret agent on September 22nd:          &quot;...We want to hare it all in readiness to be     handed over to the printers immediately we have settled     the financial question and are in a position to make the     printers a substantial payment on account,  I expect     this will be somewhere towards the end of next week.&quot;     The following circular regarding the relation of theCommunist Party to the labour Party was sent to DivisionalOrganisers by the secretary on September 20th:-          &quot;At the meeting of the National Executive Committee     over the week-end, consideration was given to the posi-     tion with regard to members of the party who refuse to     carry out the recent instruction of the Executive with     rogard to joining the individual sections of their re-     spsctive local labour parties.   The decision of the     Executive meeting on the subject is set out in the follo^p-     ing resolution, which was unanimously adopted:-               &quot;The Executive Committee reaffirms its pre-          vious decisions regarding the applicati. on of the          Party*s policy in respect of the Labour Party, with          particular reference to tho instructions to members          generally to join the individual section of their          respective local Labour Parties.  This instruction          was intended to assist the Party in maintaining im-          portant points o^T contact with the local working          class movement, and if the retention of any such          key positions were threatened by the failure of          the members concerned individually to join the Labour          Party,  such failure would be an act of disloyalty          to the  Communist Party, and must be dealt with in          a disciplinary manner.               &quot;In the case of other members not occupying          delegate positions in local Trade or Labour Parties,          refusal to carry out the Executive instructions to          join the Labour Party must also be regarded as indi-          cating a spirit of bad communism.   As,  however, the          question involved is not one of principle warranting          the expulsion of suoh members, the Executive Commit-          tee recommends the branches to provide other forms          of activity for those members to engage  in.&quot;          &quot;We are anxious to collect all possible  information     as  to steps  that have been taken by the National Labour     Party,  as well as the local Labour Parties, in the dlree-     tion of excluding from these latter bodies, delegates of     trade union  branches who are members of the Communist     Party.   I shall therefore be glad if you will kindly let     me  have  as soon as possible, a report on the  situation     covering the information in your posseosi-on up ;to date.     We  are  particularly anxious to know whether it is contended
ft 4 w      by&apos;the Labour Party-Bsecntive  or by local      labour parties, that the Edinburgh amendments      still apoly to members of the  Communist Party,      notwithstanding that SueWmembers accept the      Labour Party Constitution &amp;aG  bust the      Communist Party itself has--withdrawn: its      oppositions! parliamentary municipal candidates.&quot;      In  this connection Inkpin has  informed the Scottish Organiser that at the seme executive meeting:           &quot;We considered the position cf members      of  the  Party who return to carry out the      instructions as regards joining the individual &apos;&apos;- ; -  sections of their respective local labour      Parties.           &quot;We can quite sympathise with your-&apos;-&apos;--  &quot;feelings as to applying the whip to reealMtrant      members, but it is herdly considered sdTisable      - that that should take the form: of expulsion      except in a case where an important key position      is threatened by the recalcitrancy of a particular      memberc   Obviously if members will go so far as      to refuse to&apos; obey the Executive instruction!;, tc      join the local Labour Party, thsy would be of no      earthly use to us- inside a local Labour-Party,      even if we-were able to -compel ifc-sm to join.      The only thing,  therefore, that we can do is      to give them to understand-that we regard them      as bad  communist3 and to get their respective      branches to provide them with some other work      to do.&quot;      It is reported from a foreign source that &quot;the  Russian delegates to the International Congress of Wood Workers,  who have  returned to Russia,  state that  they were  able,  at the  Congress,  to establish the best possible relations  with the British Association  of Furniture Makers,  who are extremely-well-disposed  towards the  Third International  and the Russian Communist Party,  and gave their support to the Russian $Relegation at  the Congress  on various questions.    The  Central Bureau of Wood  Workers has decided to send the British  Furniture Makers an invitation  to  attend  the All-Bussian Comgress  of Furniture Makers,  to  take  place in Moscow on Rovember.15th.      In this  connection-it-is&apos; worthy of note that Alexander Gossip,  the secretary of  the  Furnishing Trades  Association  hss  distinct communist tendencies.
A Russian envoy who is known as Christopher Mentinari has been arrested in New York on arrival from Port Talbot: information concerning his activities was received too late for action in this country and was accordingly forwarded to the American Authorities.



"THE COMMUNIST"

The issue of "The Communist" for September 23rd deals particularly with the question of war and the organisers have been instructed that "every effort should be made to give publicity to the communist policy which will be indicated through the columns of the paper": this policy, which is in accordance with the theses of the Third International, is set out in the following paragraphs:

"The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, in view of the gravity of the situation in the Near East occasioned by the massing of British forces to defend their utterly unwarrantable tenure of Constantinople and the Straits, calls upon the members of the Party to adopt a militant attitude ? and outside of the workshop against those responsible for the campaign of hatred and aggression against the Turkish people.

"Moreover, we urge most strongly upon those members of the Party who are liable to be called up as Reservists that, instead of taking up a ? attitude, they should respond to the call determined to do all in their power to ensure that the rank and file with whom they are associated shall understand for what they are again being born from their homes, and, understanding, be able to judge whether they are being sacrificed in a cause other than their own."

A resolution recently passed by the Executive Committee is also printed, from which the following extracts are taken:

"The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain sends its greetings to the British Muslim Association and desires to join with it ? the demand which it is ? a demand ? by all the Muslim populations ? great ? Western and Southern Asia and a great part of the Continent of Africa, that Constantinople and ? shall be restored unconditionally to the custody of the Turkish people.

"We look forward to the early ?cipation from the insidious regime of the mandatory system of all the territories/

The theses mentioned are  those from which quotations  :, were given in Report No. 157.HEP INTERNATION.AL OP LABOUR UNIONS &apos;     Interesting light is thrown upon the inner workings ofthe Red International of.,Labour Unions by the following letterfrom an Englishman attached to the Central European Bureau toHarry Pollitt;          &quot;Just a personal word with you:  you will no doubt     think we are a long time in answering some of your letters     but, as you are probably aware, they are dealt with by     the &quot;business council&quot; and it is impossible for me to give     you definite and immediate replies.  Most of the vital     questions are referred to the General Headquarters, and     we must await the reply,   I am doing all I can in the     meetings for you, and you have every reason to be optimistic     as far as this end is concerned, although the letters to    ,you are couched in. terms of a buslne3allfc\V,nature0  Some     I do hot dictate but aro merely translations handed to me,     I do, however, go over all your mail before it is submitted     to the Committee and therefore I am able to put up your     side of the case.;,,..-
          &quot;I may say that Murphy:s letter was what was wanted     hero and I think it will find response.  However, as I     stated in my last, letter, we. must wait &quot;until the Executive     decides.  The recommendations from here are favourable.     One thing you must not do, however, is to alter any of     your plans because of any tiling I reveal here,, as all this j     speculative in regard to the outcome.&quot;     &quot;The Worker&quot; is not at present making any progress andJVRaQampbell is considering the possibility of reducing theprice to a penny, whereby he thinks that the circulation mightbe raised to 12^000 a week.

The following resolution passed by an audience  of about1,500 who attended a meeting held under the auspices of theNational Unemployed Workers1 Committee Movement in trafalgar square on September 24th is typical:          &quot;That this demonstration ef employed and unemployed     workers assembled in Trafalgar Square, Sunday September     24th, declare themselves definitely opposed to Great     Britain entering into a new war in the Easto  We pledge     ourselves in the event of sueh war talcing place not only     to refuse to participate in its prosecution,  but to     vigorously resist its continuation by all means in our     power.  We also call upon the General Council of the Trade     Union Congress to immediately make preparations for the     calling of a general strike throughout Great  Britain in     the event ef war being declared.   The horrors of the last     war are stamped indelibly on our minds, and we emphatical-     ly refuse to be human cannon fodder any longer in the     interest ef British Imperialism and Capitalism,     these     so-called Statesmen who centemplate launching-the&apos; workers     of Great Britain into another hideous bloodbath, we say     if you will have  war, fight it you 3eIvasB we refuse.w     Communist party -officials are still in close  touch withHannington/
