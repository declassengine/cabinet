[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should be        returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.&quot;!EEMKSSi&quot;Telegram (&quot;by telephone) from Lord Hardinge  (Paris).B,   3.20 p.m. 20th  September,  1922.No..              Following  for the Cabinet from Lord Curzon.-VERY TJHCrl?WT.              Have  just  returned from first conversation of 2          hours with M. Poincare.   It was delayed by appearance         upon the scene  of Sforaa,  who had been brought back to         Paris by poincare for the  express purpose, and who         insisted upon the right.to be present.   I replied that         I had come over by-arrangement with Poincare&apos; to have         a private  conversation with him, and until this had         talc en place  I could not agree to convert conversation         into an allied  conference.   The conversation with         Poincare&apos; alone  thereupon proceeded.              In the  meantime, I asked Sforza to come and see         me after the meeting, and  I shall invite him (with         Poiricar6&apos;s consent,  which  has been given) to attend         this afternoon  to hear Lord Bcatty-1 s statement.              At Poincare5&apos;s invitation, I commenced the con-         versation  by an exposition of the British position and^        intentions,  saying that they were based on the prin-         ciple of allied unity, appealing definitely for French         support, and asking for an immediate explanation of         the astonishing news that  France, after suggesting the                                                   solemn
solemn warning to Kemal, upon:which we had at once and loyally acted, had withdrawn her troops from Chanak.Was she going to do the same at Ismid?   Did she meanto break the allied understanding in this respect?  Wasshe prepared to admit Kemal to the shores of theDardanelles, Marmora, and Bosphorus?   Was the decisionof the conference - an early meeting of which I urged -to be taken out of our hands by a triumphant march ofKemal to the sea and an invasion of Europe?   This wasa situation in which we, at any rate, declined to bepartners.   We were prepared, as we still hoped inconjunction with our allies, to defend the Asiaticposition and at all hazards to prevent a Kemalistirruption into Europe pending the meeting of the con-ference.    Might we rely upon French assistance?     Poincare described conversation of Pelle withKemal, in which latter had said he could not arrestthe movement of his armies until they had occupied allthe territories claimed in the national pact, thatsuch action must be taken before the winter, and thathe was doubtful about allied intentions in respect ofConstantinople.     poincare admitted that this was largely &quot;blague&quot;,but said that Kemal would attend the conference onlyon his own conditions, which were acceptance of nationalist demands as regards Thrace and Constantinople.     Poincare then defended French action in withdraw-ing from Chanak on grounds - which I disputed and propose further to rebut this afternoon - that theFrench government had never been a party to French                                            military
military action south of the Straits, and that theFrench Commander at Constantinople had acted &quot;ultravires&quot;c   Position of French government was that,though the warning to Kemal was serious, it was not an ultimatum, that it was both a moral and physicalimpossibility for France to resist the Turks if theyadvanced, and that French public opinion would not admit of a shot being fired against a Turk.   he further said that no steps that could be taken would suffice to keep back the Turks, and that they couldcross to Europe when they pleased,     I entirely denied this assertion, and asked thatBeatty should be heard on the subject.   I further .-.-declined to agree to bribe Kemal to attend the confer-ence by conceding the major part of his demands in -advance,.   There would be no need for a conferenceunder such conditions.   The only chance of successfor the conference was (1) that Kemal should realizethat the game was not in his hands, (2) that no finalarrangement should be arrived at except after full discussion and with the consent of all parties, con-cerned, including the Balkan states0     Poincare declared that M. Nincic had told him that Serbia would not move, and was prepared to con-cede the Maritrza boundary straight awayc     I cited views and intended auction of Roumania,     As regards Turkey, I said that there was nodispute about Constantinople, which would, under the march proposals, revert to Turkey after peace;  that,as regards Thrace, we were quite willing to discussand to accept the modification of the frontier                                           previously
previously proposed;  but that, as regards the Straitswhereas we attached little importance to the technicalquestion of sovereignty, which could be arranged,  theBritish Empire could never agree to conditions whichwould place Gallipoli in danger, or sacrifice entireresults of the war.     Conversation will be resumed presently.     Poincare made no complaints of British action or&quot;communique&quot; and said nothing offensive.   His wholeattitude was that, whatever we might choose to do,Prance would decline to co-operate in any way southof the Straits, and that her co-operation in europe would take the form of purchasing Kemalist adherence to a conference by conceding all essential points ofthe Kemalist programme in advance.     I hope to define the position rather more clearlythis afternoon. ..
