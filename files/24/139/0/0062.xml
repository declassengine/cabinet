CP.  4261.                                m--CABIN E.T.             THE AGRICULTURAL SITUATION.MEMCRANDJU - BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE &amp; ^ FISHERIES.        I  circulate these  two Memoranda  exactly as  they   were originally submitted privately  to  the Prime   Minister.        The first makes  a  series  of suggestions for the   permanent  improvement  of agriculture and  the more Intensive   cultivation of the land.   The  second deals with the   present serious crisis in  the industry,  and makes a   proposal for temporary relief with a view to tiding   over the existing difficultyo   Unless  some steps   are  taken  promptly,  I  fear we shall  have  serious   trouble in the country especially in the  arable   districts,        I  should like to add that the suggestions made   are  of a purely tentative.  Character  and I am in no way   committed  to them.                              (intdO 4,3*9.inistry of Agriculture and Fisheries,      4th October, 1922.
 &apos;&apos;  - MEMORANDUM ON THE MEANS WHEREBY MORE INT^MSTVJS      CULTIVATION OP THE LAND &quot;MAY BE ASSURED.       At the outset some consideration must be given to the connection  between prices and the level of production that canbe attained.&apos;  &apos; It must be assumed that other things being equal more intensive farming and a high level of production per acre is more costly and requires higher prices for agricultural produce, than less productive styles of farming.   Lawes&apos; axiomthat &quot;high farming is no remedy for low prices&quot; has beenabundantly justified during the last fifty years.   Taking wheat                           this country -as an example, the competition/has to meet is not from the highly farmed countries but&apos; from Canada, North America^ theArgentine, Australia - countries With a yield which does&quot; notaverage 20 bushels per acre.   We can meet the competitionby farming in the same way, cheaply with a small outlay oflabour per acre over a wide area, thus assuring a large output per man If a small one per acre.   At a price this country can have just as intensive an agriculture as it chooses topay for, but the price must be paid.   As prices decline thenfarmers, large or small, have to adjust their methods downwardsif their production is still to show a profit.   Of course this is speaking of farmers as a body; an individual bysuperior technique or a small holder by willingness to workextra hours for his money, may counteract the pressure of falling prices, just as a new scientific discovery like theintroduction of a wheat yielding an average of 6 quarters per acre, may raise the whole level of profitable production.None the less the general law holds that the agriculturalcommunity, being what it is, cannot without incurring deeperloss meet a fall in prices by employing more labour or by                                               adding/
adding to the expenditure on fertilisers., feeding stuffs and the like.       At the present time the existing race of farmerscannot maintain the present level of farming, at current prices,.If wheat keeps below 40-/- and the prevailing costs, in the mainlabour, are continued, only the better soils can make it apaying crop and even on them the expenditure will have tobe reduced with the result of a smaller yield per acrec   Amongsmall holders,, with potatoes, vegetables and fruit at their current prices, the best and most favourably situated can alone survive,and any increase in their numbers will only tend to a still furtheroverloading of the market and collapse of pricesB   Nor canthere be any confidence in the future as long as the continentalexchanges cause all surplus production to.be thrown on Britishmarkets, and the retailers persist In their hold up by theirpreference for a small trade at high profits.       Assuming that no increase  in the farmers&apos; receipts byway of bounties on production or  protection  is feasible, theonly way out is by lowering the costs of production.   to effect this two courses are possible&apos; (l) the slow but permanenteducational method - research to  discover improved means ofproduction and the dissemination  of better practice by education,or  (2) the removal of certain handicaps, e.g. mlddlemen&apos;s charges,railway rates, charges on land like rent, rates and tithe.       With this necessary preamble the  following means of adjusting the conditions of agriculture more closely to theneed  for increased production and a greater population on theland are worthy of considerationLand  Improvement Loans.             A large proportion of land  in the country is  &quot;         short  of capital and owners are not in a position         to  incur further expenditure for which they cannot                                               - obtain/
             obtain an economic return in rent.    Loans             should be granted to landowners at  a low rate             of interest for permanent, improvements such             as the addition or reconstruction of buildings,             drainage and clearing water-courses, minor             reclamations including hedge grubbing, the provision            of water supplies, liming, etc.  Though these loans may            be granted at a low rate-of. interest a bond should be            taken to repay the loan in full whenever the estate            is sold.Land Purchase,              The Ministry of Agriculture should he given power            to purchase estates for resettlement, making payment by            the Issue of Land Stock, bearing a fixed rate of interest            and saleable in the open market like any other Government            security.   To ensure to the State a reasonable opper-            tunity of obtaining land it shall- be enacted that before            any sale of agricultural land .1s effected it shall be            offered to the State, who may acquire it at a price to            be fixed by arbitration in accordance with the            Acnuisition of Land Act (1919).   The estate will be            reorganised by the -Ministry who will carry out any            necessary Improvements and divide it Into economic            units for farming, large and small,   and offer them            for letting with the option of purchase on easy terms.          --The Colonial plan should be followed of publishing            a plan of the reallottcd estate, inviting applications            for any lot.   The option of two kinds of rent            should be given (1) rent alone, (2) rent plus            sinking fund for amortisation within a term of            years, whereby the tenant may become owner.                                         3. Loans for farming/                             - 3 -
5*  Loans., for?- Parming,o.              In order to recruit new. bipod; in agriculture and.         particularly to give an opening for the rising young man         who has secured a technical education but is forced to         emigrate because he commands no capital, loans should be         made (l) to young men qualified by education at an         agricultural college or farm institute followed by praoti-         oal experience, (2) others who can show some equivalent         experience, whereby they can begin farming on a small scale         either on one of the small holdings created as in (2) or         on private owners&apos; land0  For the first five years the         Interest and amortisation rate should be low., but then increased         to work off the loan.   During the early years of the tenancy         the system of farming must be approved by the Ministry and         Inspection carried out in order to prevent the wasting of the         assets and ensure proper management.   After a time the         inspection can be reduced to an examination of the books and         of the stock in order to see that cover remains for the loan.         Since on many kinds of land single man holdings would not be         economic, an approved body of partners willing to work under         a common manager may be similarly financed, again with         inspection.  4,  Loans TO sitting tenants.              Loans may be made to sitting tenants who can establish         a case for the profitable employment of more capital.   This         again will Involve some measure of inspection and control.  5.  Loans to owner-occupiers.              Some assistance is necessary in order to meet the very         pressing and Immediate case of tenants who have been forced         during the land sales of the last few years to hamper them-         selves by the purchase of their holdings and who now find                                                           /that
       that with the fall in values of land their mortgages  are no       longer covered by the value of their holding.    Such  tenants       may either sell to the State for Land Stock and become       tenants with the option at any time of paying  a further       charge for amortisation which will again put them In       possession, or they may transfer their mortgages to the       State and obtain the benefit of the lower rate of interest       the State can charge for land.   Again in such cases  inspection       and control may be claimed as long as the loan is outstanding-6.  Markets,            One of the most urgent needs of the &quot;agriculturist is  the       provision of better marketing facilities whereby the  consumer       can obtain some of the benefit of the lower prices prevailing       and thus cause an extension of the demands  The State might       co-operate with municipalities or farmers1 co-operative       societies for the provision of markets for the sale of milk,       meat, fish, poultry and eggs, potatoes, vegetables, produce       and fruit,            Such a proposition must be dismissed as politically       impossible since it would meet with the determined opposition       of all traders organisations., who would raise a great  outcry       against either &quot;State-aided co-operation&quot; or &quot;municipal  ..       trading&quot;, but it could do much to bring closer the now very       divergent producers and consumers&apos; prices.7.  Burdens on Land.            The most pressing need for relief is to reduce       the. &quot;rating upon agricultural land.   Occupiers of       agricultural land in proportion to their income pay a       -much greater share of local rates than any other rate-       payers, since they are obliged to occupy so much rate-      . able&apos; property in order to earn their living.   A farmer                     &apos;-                                  /with
with 300 acres may not earn more than a shopkeeperwho is assessed at  30 per annum, yet he is paying, onthe whole of his acreage0   It Is true that he only payshalf the poundage under the. provisions of the AgriculturalRates Act, 1896, hut rates have gone up enormously since then and his present burden is Intolerable, especially as the deficiency in the quots for the parish has to bemade up by an increased poundage * .  The Act of 1896 was based on the report of a Royal Commission which recommendedthat land should only pay a quarter cf the poundage andthat the whole remission should be borne by the Exchequer.This recommendations should now be adopted^,   It has been estimated that this would cost the Treasury about threemillions a year and would relieve the farmers on the averagetO the extent of about half-a-crown in the pound.     Another burden^ which must be dealt with, is that ofTithec   This burden is very serious, and when the presentTithe Act comes to an end in 1926 the Tithes will at ohoego Up from their present rate of 109 to something over130*   At the same time, the clergy will lose the advan-tages which they get now in the matter of the rating ofTithes,   The best way Of dealing satisfactorily withTithe would appear to be to extinguish it by means ofcommutation.   Compulsory Commutation should graduallybe carried out and should be effected either by moneypayments or by the surrender of part of the land. Suchland would be retained by the State for conversion intosmall holdings and the tithe owner would be given an equivalent amount of land Stock.
0.  Railway Rates,       in order to put the agriculturist on equalterms with foreign competitors inland freight charges on agricultural produce should he drastically lowered.  This,however, is impossible ab long as the railways ateprivately owned, as it would require a direct subsidy to each railway company.   Oh foreign railways the subsidy to agricultural produce is disguised because cost accountsare not kept against each class of traffic.   None theless some enquiry should be made into the alleged cases ofpreferential rates for foreign produce along British lines,now disguised under a combined rail and sea freight,9.  Land Reclamation and Afforestation.       These should be in the charge of permanent brandiesof the Ministry.   Land reclamation is in many cases nowfeasible but requires continuous technical study.  Theduties of the branch should be confined to the preparation 6schemes, the acquisition of tZae land and. its futureadaptation and settlement, leaving the actual work ofreclamation to be carried out by contract.       The Ministry should be empowered to acquire compul-compulsorily frontages and other areas suitable for reclamationand to contract with owners for ohe reclamation of areas atan agreed price not necessarily economic.10.  Educational.       There exist in many directions openings for the instruction of farmers of a technical or commercial naturewhich cannot well be carried out by the local EducationalAuthorities, because the instruction is of too special atype or applies only to a limited public so that the needfor it is not generally apparent to a local-EducationAuthority.   Examples may be seen in the need for the instruction of sheep farmers, especially in the hillcountries in methods of improvement of wool by breeding and
the proper grading of fleeces, in fruit.....gr^din^--aj]Lxr^pa.-ok^Ln^and in several other directions.    For such subjectsteachers are scarce and can only be engaged for full time if in the service of the Ministry,       The Ministry might be enabled to employ a flyingstaff for the purposes iand give instruction directly, co-operating with the local authorities in tho arrangements, butbesoming itself responsible for the instruction.       The Ministry&apos;s scheme for the provision of scholar-ships whereby the -children of agricultural labourers, a3&amp;Lsmall holders may proceed to Farm Institutes and Agricul-tural Colleges should be expanded.  At present it onlyprovides for the higher instruction of from one to two hundred children annually for the whole of England and Wales.Boys thus selee-tisd and trained would become eligible toobtain farms from tho State under Clause 3 and would provevaluable recruits to the industry.  Nothing would do more toOffer a prospect of advancement to the agricultural labourerswho feel deeply their disabilities as regards their children in comparison with workers in the towns.                          FINANCE.       The method adopted in tho Land Settlement (Facilities)Act should be followed and a sum of         shall be assignedby Parliament for the purposes indicated, to bo voted fromyoar to year as required.  Three Commissioners shi.ll beappointed in whom shall rest the sanction or refusal ofschemes under the.Act.   Tho schemes shall be prepared by theMinistry of Agriculture and shall go to the Commissionersaccompanied by a report of the Treasury^  All purchases ofland and loans shall be made by means of the issue of LandStock which shall be a Government security bearing a fixedrate of interest charged upon the Consolidated Fund andsaleable In the open market,.   In the case of loans, the
recipient shall give a bond covenanting to make an annual payment for a term of years in repayment with su.ch        jsecurity as may bo deemed necessary in each case.  The    ;jmeasure of assistance granted in each case Trill be measured by the difference between the. amount of land     &apos;Stock issued and tho value of the bond so obtained inreturn.   In the case of loans for improvements ofestates the owner will also give a bond to repay this    %difference as and v/hen the estate may bo sold.

                   fe^CRISIS IN AGRICULTURE.      The suggestions which I submitted to you a fortnight agowere aimed principally at two objects, (l) to endeavour to cheapenthe cost of production&apos; in agriculture by the use of State credit and by removing the burdens on land which are oppressive, and (2),to make provision for settling more people on the land as small-holders with facilities for the purchase of their holdings.  Theimportance of this cannot be overestimated having regard to the&quot;top-heavy&quot; industrialism which prevails at present.  these objects, however, cannot  be accomplished immediately and their effect will be gradual, and in any case, a bill dealing with them could not be introduced into parliament until next Session.     In the meantime, however, we are up against a, very seriouscrisis.  At the present moment, farming,, and especially arablefarming, cannot be made to pay, and there is a likelihood of agreat deal more land bein;: laid down to grass with wholesale dis-charges of labour ana big cuts in agricultural wages.  This wouldmean a further decrease in production and a further depopulationof the country districts.  As I have pointed out before, the agree-jaents of most of the Conciliation Committees terminate in the nextfew weeks; some, indeed, have terminated already, and in these latter cases, the Committees have met and have come to the con-elusion that farmers cannot  pay more than 25/- a week to theirmen and that the men cannot live for less than 30/- a week, andthey have, therefore, decided to take no further action.  Bothsides are appealing to the Government for help, and look to usto get them out of the difficulty.     I have discussed the situation with Lord Milner and withother leaders of the industry, for example,  Lord Lon^, Mi.  Strutt,
Captain Pretyman, Captain Eitzroy,  Lord Clinton,  etc.,  etc.,and also with the chief representatives of the national Farmers1Union and of the Labourers&apos;  Unions.  The two latter  bodies  are inclose accord and demand assistance; they are ashing  you to  receive     There is a considerable divergence of opinion as to whetherthe present slump is likely to be temporary or permanent.  Iincline to the former view, believing that it has been largelycaused by the collapse of foreign exchanges and will right itselfsooner or later,- but there can be no doubt of the seriousness atthe moment.  If the farmer cannot make his crops pay, he mustreduce costs, and the only direction in which he can effect aserious reduction is in wages^ which represent nearly 50% of histotal costs.  It is almost impossible to cut down the other 50%in any way.  This is partly due to the high wages paid in otherindustries, for example,  railway rates cannot be brought down onaccount of -the high wages of railway men.     With great reluctance I have been driven into the opinionthati  without abandoning  the proposed permanent policy,  some temporary measure is necessrry to tide over the difficulty.   Inthis view I am strongly supported by Lord- miner,  &quot;hat  we want to do  is to maintain as large an amount of arable lan-.;&apos;. aspossible at the present time^  both with the object of keeping upproduction and also to prevent unemployment on a large scale, andthe proposal which I am going to make has these objects in view.It is also necess-ary to take precautions to see that labourreceives a fair proportion of any advantage conferred.     We have at the present moment in England and Wales slightlyover 11 million acres of arable land, which is about 300,000acres more than before the war.  I*!i?re are, I believe, about,350,000 acres in Scotland, but I have not got the latest figures.  The proposal which I males is that we should pay  a subsidy of  1 per acre on all  arable land existing when the nexta joint deputation.
returns are made in June 1923., provided that the farmer satiefieus  (l) that he has as much arable land as he had this year,  (2)that from the present time until- then he has employed on theaverage as many men as he employed during this year^  and (3),that he has paid a wage of not less than the ordinary ratecurrent on September 1st this year,  tf a farmer does not choose to  comply with these conditions he will not be eligible for  thesubsidy.  In some ca-ses probably it will suit him better to  lay down to grass and not to employ the labour, but I think that inthe majority of cases, the inducement&apos;would be sufficient, andwould prevent&apos; discharges and cuts in wages to a figure belowsubsistence level for the next 12 months.  This is,  of course,a mere temporary expedient to tide over a period of  crisis.   Itshould be for one year only, although I do not disguise the  factthat it may have to be repeated.  The cost would be  in theneighbourhood  of  14,000^000.  The question which the Governmenthas to consider is whether it is better to find this  money or toallow large amounts of land to be laid down to grass,  thuspossibly putting out of work 100,000 labourers and at the sametime having industrial strife on the question of wages all overthe country.     It is obvious that if the Cabinet decides on some suchcourse of action, it will have to make up its mind at once,  andthe matter will have to be dealt with in the Autumn  Session  ofParliament.  In the meantime, we could prepare a permanentmeasure dealing with those $ther matters which we discussedbefore to be introduced next Session.  Unless, however,  something in the nature of what I have suggested is done now I  anticipateserious trouble.  Both the farmers and labourers hove someclaim on us in view of the fact that we repealed Part I  of the agriculture Act without giving the promised four years&apos;  notice.This proposal will be less costly than the Agriculture Act wouldhave been, and would also be far more effective since it dealswith all arable land irrespective of the crops grown  on  it.  It
also avoids the setting up of a Wages Board and  will  enableConciliation Committees to continue  their work,   furthermore.,it is entirely free of that Government interference and  controls J much resented by farmers,  the sole duty of  the Departmentbeins to ascertain (a) the acreage of arable on  each  farm,  (b)the number of men employed compared  with the number employedthis year, and (c) that a minimum wage of 3o/- has been  paid.     The attached paper shows the sort of thinr  which is going on at the Conciliation Committees.                       ----r---     (intld.) A&quot;oG.3.2nd October,  1922
      &quot;The Oxfordshire &quot;Oc-nolllft-Litm-Ooimni.ttee have metto-day and. hove failed to reach an agreement as to the rateof wages and hours of labour for the coming winter.  TheEmplo3rers representatives are fully convinced that theindustry cannot pay a higher wage than 25/- for a week of50 hours- at the present price of agricultural produce.  TheWorkers representatives are unable to agree to this rate onthe ground that the land workers of Oxfordshire cannot live in decency on less than 3o/- a week so long as the Cost ofliving remains at its present level.  Each side accepts thestatement of the other side as1 correct, and the Committeehave decided that the Government be entreated to at oncedevise and carry such measures as will place agriculture insuch a position that the farmer may receive a reasonablerecompense for his labour and the worker receive such a wage that he can live in decent comfort**                       (Sgd.)
