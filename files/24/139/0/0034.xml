Losing a lot of lives in hanging on is what I want toguard against especially if Cabinet then say that they cannotreinforce me.  VJhy not start at once and give TurkeyConstantinople and Maritza, having, offered them to them, andso end it all.  Keep a force and big ?fleets on Gallipoliwith advanced guard Chanak.      These small forces trying to stop here and keep order and ordered to fight to last at Chanak, if Mustapha&apos;s replyis truculent, are bound to get into difficulties if negotiatiare prolonged.      There is no time for delay..  Remember Turks are withinsight of their goal and are naturally  elated.      No one is more anxious to avoid  a war than I am, butit is the very way to get dragged into one.2 Whitehall  Gardens,  8E&apos;.  1.     27th  September,  1922.
