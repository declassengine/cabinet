I  1                        TURKISH pJBIGNS IH  IRAQ..                Note by the Secretary of State for the  Colonies..                I circulate to my colleagues the  following telegram         which has been received from the High Commissioner for  Iraq,                                          (Inid.)   D.         Colonial Office,              51st October, 1922,Dated 22nd October.     There has been considerable activity during the wholeof this year on the part of Turkish garrison at Rowanduz  inIraq territory which Is in telegraphic communication with Van.The recent operations in Ranla district as well as theoperations in the Dasht-I-Harlr last December have been directresult of definite aggression by detachments from thatgarrison.   This as well as certain incidents in Mosul divisionhas been regularly reported to you in my air-mail summaryand on some occasions also by telegram.     At the present moment there are signs that a complete withdrawal of Turkish elements from Iraq is In progress,  forthey have already withdrawn from practically every place to which they had penetrated (including it is reported Rowanduz).This withdrawal is due to remarkable effect which has been achieved during the past few weeks by vigorous and sustainedair audacity.   That the Turks received no orders to withdrawis Indicated by fact that Commander of Rowanduz garrison  wasin ^:ala DIza on October 17th holding conference with Pizhderleaders.   Q,ala Diza was bombed the same date and Euzdemirwithdrew.   Air action alone unsupported by land forces has
suceeS3fully driven the Turks from districts Rania KoiSanjak, Qala Diza and Bira Kapra in the north.   Re-cecu-pation of Koi Sanjak Without any opposition by political officer and Police was entirely due to previous aerial action,and the general situation as regards Turkish aggressionwhich had given rise to considerable anxiety is now to alarge extent restored.     I consider it of importance that the Turks should net .be allowed to claim any credit for a. withdrawal which, hasbeen forced upon them and this is why I am emphasising atthis early date after the change of command remarkablesuccess which has attended a free and vigorous use of ouraerial resources.   At the same time recent reports fr-;:-mMosul appear tf* indicate Turkish forces on the Jazirahfront are being strengthened.
