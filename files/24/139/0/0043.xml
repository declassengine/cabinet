(1)   Copy of letter from Secretary  to the Cabinet  to Secretary of  StateOffices of the Cabinet,  2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.   26th September, 1922.Dear Lord Curzon,     At a meeting of a Conference of Ministers  attended by theChiefs of Staff of the throe Fighting Services  in  Mr.  Churchill1sroom at the Colonial Office this afternoon, Air Marshal Tronchardraised-, as a matter of great urgency, the  question of  whether itV ou.be possible, in view of tho limited aerodrome  accommodation at Gallipoli, to use Imbros Island, where  a good aerodrome  exists. -     You Trill remember that this aerodrome was  established  duringthe war close to the Military G.H.Q. at the -south-eastern point  ofthe island.                                &quot;     During the meeting, General Travors Clarke mentioned that theEar Office had already consulted the Foreign  Office  as  to whetheruse could be made of Hudros Harbour in the Island  of Lemnos..  Ifoperations should develop at Chanak., or Gallipoli, a base would  borequired.     As the.result of these discussions I  was instructed definatly to raise the question with the .Foreign Office as to.  whether It wouldbe possible for ova&apos; forces to use these islands.     Some reference was made to the Island of Tcredos.    You will re-call that during the Dardanelles Campaign  the French had an aerodromethere and I presume its status is the same as that of the other&quot;  is-lands and might therefore usefully be considered at  the same time.     At the  conclusion of the meeting, Air Marshal Trenchard againimpressed on me that the matter was one.of considerable importance from the point,, of view of the air forces.

Foreign Office,S.W,                                                   28th September 1922    My dear Hankey,         Lord Curzon wishes me to  tell you that the question raised    in your letter of the 26th September, regarding the possible    use of the Islands of Imbros,  Lemnos and Tenedos for military    purposes in the event of operations developing at Chanak or    Gallipoli, has been, considered by this Department.      2,  As you are aware, these islands are dealt with in Article    84 of the Treaty of Sevres; it appears from this that the    sovereignty of Imbros and Tenedos is still technically Turkish;    and while the position of Lemnos is more doubtful we were able    to justify our use of it during the war on the ground that it    also was still Turkish.      3,  For present purposes, however, the question of technical    sovereignty would not appear to make any great difference.    For if the Islands are still Turkish, we presumably have the    right to occupy them under Article 7 of the Armistice, while    if the armistice is terminated by hostilities we should    clearly have an undoubted right to do so.   If they are Greek,    we could certainly occupy them if Greece were to he regarded    as an Ally in  the event of hostilities, and even if We were    not prepared to  admit this, Greece could, hardly be regarded as    a neutral in hostilities against Turkey and&apos;would almost    certainly raise no objection to our using her territory, or    territory claimed by her,  for military purposes^      4,  No&apos; copies of this letter have been distributed , as you may    wish, to circulate them yourself..                               Yours sincerely,                                  (Sgd )&apos; W; TYRRELL.Whitehall Gardens. S.W.,September 29th, 1922.,
