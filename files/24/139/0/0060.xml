(Note &quot;by Secretary,,)      With reference to the Report of Sub-Committee on WarBook (Hear East), (CiP, 4244) and the Report of Sub-Committeeon Censorship (CP .4246), the measures recommended to betaken in the event of hostilities with the Turkish Nationalistsare enumerated in the Annexure to this Note and set forth in greater detail than in the former Report.20  Attention is specially called to the two following recommendations of the Sub-Committee.        (a) That no notification Of the initiation of            &quot;Precautionary&quot; and &quot;War&quot; Stages be isrued,            but that Departments should take such            action as they consider, necessary to            communicate in appropriate terms the state            of affairs to local or other administra-            tions with which they are concerned.        (b) That any Department whose duty it is to            initiate action under any specific heading            of the War Book should berresponsible for            seeing that such limited action is taken            under that heading as.is appropriate to            the situation now under consideration.3.  Since the general scheme of Censorship eontemplated inthe War Book is not appropriate to the present situation,a special limited scheme of Censorship is recommended in the report of the Sub-Committee (C .P. 4246).     The Sub-Committee ask for the instructions of theCabinet as to whether British Censorship Stations should beestablished at Lemnos and Syra and the Rhodes and Black SeaCables landing at Constantinople  should he cut.or whetherall/
        all  cables  landing  in  Turkey-in-Asia and certain other        cables  should be  cut.   They also recommend that a special        Committee be set  up with,  as little delay as possible to        maintain close  relations  with  the press to ensure that        undesirable matter  is  not published in the press  of        Great Britain,  and  that this Committee should  function        even before any mobilisation is  ordered.  A suggestion has        reached me  that a representative^bf the prime  Minister and        of the  Foreign  Office  should be  added to the  Committee.                                    (Sgd.)
