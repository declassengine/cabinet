THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS BRITANNIC MaJESTY&apos;S (&amp;TONMENT                          0 A B I I E I,                   REPORT Og THE COMMITTEE ON EXPENDITURE.                         ( CIVIL DEBARTMENTS ).         Memorandum by.the Minister of Labour onmthe Estimates                    for&quot; Industrial Training 1923**24.     In view of the proposals with regard to provisionfor the Industrial Training of Disabled Ex-Service Men(E.C.S. 10 Part I) which have been approved by theSecretary of State for War&apos;s Sub-Committee and submittedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.4270] for theconsideration of the Cabinet, I desire to.recirculatebelow certain observations which I had previously placed before the Sub-Committee, but whioh I think my Colleaguesmust certainly have in mind in arriving at a finaldecision.(1)  In my sketoh Estimates for the Ministry of Labour1923-24, I provided for the purpose of Industrial training the same sum as was taken for 1922-23* namely  4,691,500.I observe from the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;s memorandum(CP.4270) that it Is proposed to reduce this figure to 3,000,000, with a possible further reduction to 2,700,000 if the scale of pensions is reduced.   I amunable to agree with this proposal and I would urge theCabinet to retain the same figure as for 1922-23, namely 4,691,500.(2)  The sum required for this service has always been,and still is, exceedingly difficult to estimate inadvance, because the progress of the Training Scheme is directly dependent upon the state of trade and upon theattitude of Trade Advisory Committees, whom the Ministrycan only control to a very limited extent.   The result has been that in the past expenditure has fallen belowthe estimate, because trade has been worse than was anticipated.
(3)  The advocates of the ex-Service men have pointed to.the difference between expenditure and estimates as a proof that the Government is economising at their expense.   Thispoint has &quot;been raised more than once in the House of Commons,and the Report of the Select Committee on the Training andEmployment of Disabled Ex-Service Men, recently published,emphasizes it.   In my opinion, to reduce the estimate for1923-24 presents the ex-Servioe man with an argument forattacking the Government which it is exceedingly difficultto answer in any manner at all oonvincing to him or to thepublica(4)  It must be borne in mind that a strong case can, on merits, be made out for remodelling the existing training scheme in a way whioh would involve a very much larger expendi&quot;turs of monsy*   The Scheme provides in general for a periodof training in an Institution on full maintenance followed bya period known as improvership with an employer on part main-tenance, and a further period on reduced wages.   The greatdifficulty during the period of trade depression has been tofind improverships, with the result that a large number ofmen (at the present moment over 4,000) have been discharged from training centres and are waiting for improverships whichthey must pass through before they can become fully skilledmen0   I am perpetually confronted with the argument that theonly way in whioh the country can discharge its obligation tothese men is to take them back into training centres and keep them there for the full periods  laid down in the Scheme.The Select Committee deal with this point as follows&quot;The period of Training in Government Instructional Factories-is not altogether satisfactory;...........Trainees shouldnot normally be discharged from a Factory until an Improver-ship has been found for them, and those who have been dis-charged and for whom no improverships have been found should
bo brought back, at their option, to the factory&quot;.    as these men. have reached the stage at which they require,and can perform, a large amount of productive work, theexpense of carrying them up to the end of their full periodof training is very large, and would really entail  the conversion.of training centres into productive factories,either wasting their products or competing in restrictedindustrial markets.   Por this reason I have so far resistedIt, but if the ex-Service men were to find a competent andpersistent advocate who could state the oase clearly tothe public,  it would, in my opinion, become impossible to resist the claim.   If we give the ex-Service men reasonfor thinking that we are deliberately economising at theirexpense  and do not intend to carry out our obligations,their demands will become much more insistent,(5)  The effect of any improvement in trade (as to  whichsee Paper T.P.29 by the President of the Board of Trade)will be greatly to accelerate the rate at which we  can placemen into training and consequently the expenditure  during1923-24,   It would be, in my opinion, in any case imprudentto reduce the amount, and it is politically most unwise*                             (Sgd.)
