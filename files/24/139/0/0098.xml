THE  DOMINIONS  AND THE LAUSANNE CONFERENCE.Correspondence circulated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.                       (November 8, 1922.)   The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of Canada,            Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.                                                            October 27, 1922.    FOLLOWING for your Prime Minister :-    &quot; Yesterday invitations were sent by Governments  of  Great Britain,  Franceand Italy to the Japanese, Roumanian, Jugoslav, Greek and Turkish Governments(both of Constantinople and  of Angora) to send  representatives to Lausanne,13th November, to conclude treaty to end war in East which would replace Treatyof Sevres.   Russian  Soviet Government and  Bulgarian Government also beinginvited to send to Lausanne, at a date to be fixed, representatives to  take part in discussions  on questions of the Straits which the conference  will undertake at alater  stage.   Enquiry is also  being addressed  by the three Governments to theGovernment of the United States  expressing  hope that they  will permit UnitedStates representative to be present during Lausanne negotiations in a capacitysimilar to that in which United  States representative was present during negotia-tions at San Remo in 1920,  or to take more active part in the  negotiations,specially on question  of the Straits.    &quot; According  to arrangements  agreed upon with French and Italian Govern-ments, each Government will be  represented at  Lausanne by two plenipotentiaries.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will personally act  as chief British Plenipotentiaire-tentiary, and it is proposed  that  he  should be  accompanied by British  HighCommissioner at Constantinople.   Dominion Government will be kept informedfrom time to time of the general lines of policy on which  British plenipotentiariespropose to proceed, and of  the course of negotiations, and,  as in case of  the othertreaties arising out of the peace  settlement, they will, of  course, be invited to signnew treaty and any separate instruments regulating status of the Straits.    &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government trusts that this procedure will be in accordancewith wishes of your Government.    &quot; British plenipotentiaries  are  fully acquainted with  the imperial aspect ofthe problem and with the keen interest taken by the dominion  Governments in itssolution.  Similar telegram sent to other Prime Ministers. DEVONSHIRE.&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governors-General of  Canada, Australia,                   Neio Zealand and the Union of South Africa.(Personal and Secret.)                                        October 27, 1922.    Following for your Prime Minister :     &quot; My code telegram of to-day&apos;s date.   You have been  sent  by Secretary  ofState for Foreign Affairs prints  containing correspondence  between M. Poincareand himself as to arrangements for Near East Conference.  You should know thatM. Poincare, in course of the discussions, informed Lord Curzon privately that ifthe dominions and India were represented at Lausanne the French Governmentwould demand that Morocco and  Tunis should equally be represented.  Lord      [9071]
Curzon replied to  this that the status of the dominions and  India  was once andfor all settled in Paris in 1919 with full  concurrence of M. Clemenceau, that theysigned the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties, including the Treaty of Sevres,and  that  they became  separate  members of the League of Nations.   He  was unable to admit  that  similar status  could be accorded to Tunis or Morocco.M. Poincare replied that at that moment he  did not wish to engage in discussion on this point, but he continued to press claim as regards Tunis  and Morocco.M. Pomcare&apos;s  precise object in raising question is not clear, but you will  see that lord Curzon fully maintained right of dominions.  Arrangements outlined in  mycode telegram  of to-day for representation of  British Empire by Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs follow those adopted in connection with  Treaty of Sevres, and,in any case, practical considerations render it desirable to limit the number of  theplenipotentiaries at Lausanne. DEVONSHIRE.&quot;   From the Governor-General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Secret.)                                                     October 31, 1922.    Following for you from my Prime Minister :     &quot; I have the  honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Grace&apos;s telegram of27th October,  informing Government of Canada of invitations to the lausanne conference which the Governments of Great Britain, France and Italy have sentto the Governments  of other countries setting forth the procedure in referencethereto.    &quot; Government of  Canada has  no exception to take to the course pursued byHis Majesty&apos;s  Government regarding the conclusion of a treaty to end the war inthe Near Bast.  As it is proposed, however, to keep Canadian Government informedfrom time to time of the  general lines  of policy which British  plenipotentiariespropose to follow and of the course of the negotiations, and to invite us to sign anew treaty and any separate instrument regulating the status of the  Straits, weconsider it advisable to take the earliest opportunity  to inform His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that in our  opinion the  extent  to  which the  proceedings of  theconference or the provisions of any treaty or other  instrument arising  out of thesame may be held to bind Canada is necessarily a matter for the Parliament ofCanada to decide, and that the  rights and  powers in these particulars of ourParliament  must not  be  held  to be  affected  by  implication or  otherwise  in virtue of information  which may be supplied to our Government. BYNG.&quot;  From the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of                            State for the Colonies.                                                            October 31, 1922.    Prime Minister sends you following message with reference to your telegramsof 27th October on the subject of Lausanne Conference :     &quot; The Government of the Union of South Africa has no intention and makes no  claim  to be represented at  Lausanne Conference  by Union  delegates andassumes that this will also be the attitude  of the other dominions.  It is, however,questionable whether the dominions should in such cases be called  upon to sign the eventual peace treaty.   I know that  this course has been adopted in case ofother similar treaties arising from the Versailles Treaty where dominions were not represented at conference, but it does not seem fair or even necessary that in suchcases the dominions should sign the  treaties and it would be preferable for themsimply to take  note of the conclusion of the treaty without  being  called  upon to sign it.   Awkward  parliamentary questions  may be raised  in  the dominions  bysignature under such  circumstances and it is in the interest of all to leave  such questions alone.     &quot; Union Government  feels much  disturbed  by the attitude of  the  presentFrench Prime Minister in regard  to  dominion  representation at  international conferences. M. Poincare&apos;s attitude and his reference in this connection to Tunis&apos;and Morocco form - a  grave challenge to  dominion  status  as settled at PeaceConference and in the Peace Treaty and may lead to most serious complications on some future occasion.  The correct attitude of Lord Curzon is appreciated mostdeeply.   Occasions may arise,  as at Washington, where the dominions do  claim

November 2, 1922.     Mr. Hughes asks me to send following message :      &quot;With reference your telegram of 27 th October re Near East Conference and representation of Australia  thereat, the  suggestion of the French Prime Minister that if the dominions were represented France would  demand that Tunis and Morocco be treated similarly and Lord Curzon&apos;s rejoinder to M. Poincare are noted. I fear, however, that I cannot quite appreciate your point when you say, &apos; You will see that Lord Curzon fully maintained rights  of dominions,&apos; after  which you proceed to notify me that, &apos; Practical considerations render it desirable to limit the number of plenipotentiaries,  and, in short, that Lord Curzon and the British High Commissioner at Constantinople would act.&apos;     &quot; It is understood, of course, that  we are to  sign the  new treaty when  made or  to refrain from doing so as we deem fit.  That, put very shortly, is the position, and what it all means is quite clear.  We are to go on in the same bad old way. No part whatever was taken  by us in making  Treaty of  Sevres.  We  signed  it when made.   Technically, we  are concerned only in  enforcing  observance  of its provisions by the fact that Australia was a signatory.   Our position in  the recent Near East crisis would actually.have been same if we had  not  signed.  Australia was prepared to go to war not because Treaty  of Sevres had been signed, but because she was part of the Empire, and Britain had rightly or wrongly committed herself to a policy which might lead to war, and the interests of the Empire were involved.  The  Commonwealth Government  did not  approve of many  of the provisions of the  Treaty of Sevres, nor of British policy  towards Greece, which seems to have been one of  the factors that led to recent  crisis.  The Common- wealth Government was asked to sign the treaty when it was  made and when  it&apos; could not be modified.  It did  so.  It  was asked  to say whether it was ready to support Britain in a policy upon which it had not previously been consulted, and, although this probably meant being once more launched into a war made by Britain acting on her own responsibility,-it  said that it was ready to stand by her-to be represented, if necessity arose, by  a great  army, not merely by a contingent of troops.  But  it  protested against  these declarations of policy  by Britain acting alone by which whole  Empire might ipso facto be plunged into war.     &quot; Now we are informed that we are not to have representation at a conference which is going to effect  substantial modifications in Treaty of Sevres.   We are assured that a valiant  defence of our  status  and rights was made;  that the French Prime Minister was told very plainly that the  question  of our . status was finally settled in 1919  and could not be reopened, and also no  doubt that it was not material in any case, as practical considerations made it desirable that Empire should  be represented  by  Foreign Secretary and the High  Commissioner at Constantinople.     &quot; Plain speaking  between  friends and blood relations is  best.  What  you suggest may be, probably will  be, quite satisfactory to Canada and South Africa; they were not prepared to  fight.  Australia was, and most emphatically it is not satisfactory to her.  The suggestion may be dismissed  that modified treaty  will commit us to nothing unless and until we  sign it.   We are equally involved in whatever consequences arise out of  it, whether we sign it  or not.   This habit of asking Australia to agree to things when they are done and cannot be undone, andrepresentation, and if France resists the claim or tries to bring on the scene Tunisand  Morocco  the  dominions may have to 1&apos;request  the support of Great Britain,even  to  the extent  of not  attending  herself without the dominions.   This may give rise to serious crisis, but at all costs the dominions must defend their  statuseven to the extent of imperilling friendship with France.  Dominions will considerit an insult to be placed on the same level as Morocco and Tunis.  It  may havebeen  a mistake originally to have  recognised India, as she was not fully self-governing, but that  recognition was the deliberate act of the Peace  Conferenceunder very special circumstances and should form no precedent for the future.  Ihave complete confidence in the future support of the Imperial Government should it become necessary, but it may be advisable  to warn M. Poincare in advance as tothe grave danger to Anglo-French  co-operation which might arise if France werein any way to  call in question dominion status. ARTHUR FREDERICK.&quot;
when there is only one course open  to  us in practice and that  is to supportBritain- is one  which will wreck the  Empire  if persisted in.    Already  seen,Canada and South Africa  standing aloof on the plea  that they  had  not  been consulted.  I have pointed out in the Imperial Cabinet  many times that what iswanted, and what we are entitled  to, is a  real  share  in moulding foreign and imperial policy.   In foreign affairs, the Empire must speak with  one voice, butwhose voice is that to be ?  Surely not only that of a British political party !  as things  are, foreign policy  matters, by which  all  are  affected, are treated as thefootballs of British political parties.   This is all right in British domestic affairs,but in foreign affairs we cannot tolerate such a state  of  affairs.   Suppose that atthe coming elections Labour Party gets a majority, there  will be another change inforeign policy, and it may be a complete  volte face   We may be  quite sure that,after the  election, things will not  be the  same as before it.   True  position:yesterday one foreign policy is put forward by the  British Government and we are asked to support it, and we do so.  A change of Government conies  about, and weare asked now to support quite another one ; or is it  the same ?   Nobody knowsand nobody can tell us.  We have not had a voice  in  either case in  moulding thepolicy.   We ought not to be  forced into war without previous consultation whilstpeace was yet possible or be made to appear ridiculous in the  world&apos;s eyes bydeclaring ourselves to-day in favour of one policy and  in little more than a monthstime being compelled by a  change  of  Government  in  Britain to  favour  quiteanother.    &quot; I do  not know we are very deeply concerned about the Treaty of Sevres, butwar in the Near East may come out of it so much has  been demonstrated andthen India, Egypt and the Far East would be affected.  Australia would have tofight to defend Suez Canal.    &quot; The  Treaty of  Sevres will affect Moslem world and so India and Egypt.  Ifit affects India, it will not leave Far East as it is.    &quot;In the face of all this, you tell us that we are not to  have  representation atthis conference and that Empire will be represented by two Englishmen; that weshall, of course, be kept fully informed  of how things go, and that we shall  haveright  to sign  treaty or to decline to sign it.   All I  can say is that it  is most unsatisfactory.&quot; From the Governor-General of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies-                                                            November 3,  1922.    Your telegram of 27th October.    Government of New Zealand agree to procedure proposed to be  adopted byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in connection with Lausanne Conference. JELLICOE.
