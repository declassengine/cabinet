If war comes we must organise to    prevent its machinery from working.If fight we must,    let us  determine whom we will fight and where.   Ours is not   . a pacifist policy by any means.  There must be  no more war    for capitalism.  If war there be, it must-be civil war, -  revolution.&quot;        r            -;:  - : -    &apos;    -        .

(b)   Members who are nominated by labour Parties will, adoptthe following attitude      (1)  They will endeavour to persuade the labour Party           to permit them to run on their own programme.      \2)  Where this is not permissible they should          ; endeavour to get as many clauses or principles of           our programme as possible, embodied in the Labour           Party programme.      (Z)  Where this is not, accorded, members of the Party           should not allow this to prevent in any way, theii           acceptance of the candidature.     , (4)  In cases,, such, as the London Labour Party, where           the&quot; Central Labour Party, will try. to get local           Labour Parties to accept the Central programme,   ..       this is not compulsory, and our members should           endeavour to get the local Labour Party to adopt           their own programme.  This will, give greater           opportunity for getting some of our clauses           embodied.  -(c)   Members of the Party on Labour Parties will pursue atactic which will assist in the realisation of the above.     The question of Finance  is  of great  importance,especially in districts where Party candidates  are&apos;running.We feel it essential that no  opportunity  of gaining prestigefor the Party shall be lost through lack  of finance..   Wetherefore recommend that there shall be a general levy of .6d* per member on the whole membership of the Party,   Thislevy shall be forwarded not&quot;later than Saturday, October  14th,to the Divisional Organiser,  and shall be used  by the division&apos;for the purpose of ensuring aid  for those candidatureswhich are financially strained.

It is reported, on the authority of a single informant,that when the British cruiser squadron was at Danzig last month the local Communist Party detailed 16 members who could speakEnglish to offer  themselves as guides to the sailors:  thesemen pursued their propaganda by means of conversation but noliterature was distributed lest, it should fall into the handsof officers.     On September 28th a bundle of literature, weighing about50 lbSo and containing copies of the theses of the Third Inter-national and  other communist literature was found on the quay-side at Surrey Commercial Docks:  the bundle was Sying near the S.S. &quot;Vladimir Russanoff&quot;, an Arcos boat and had in all probability been deposited by a member of the crew, one of vhomspoke&quot;English and had 35 copies of &quot;The Communist&quot; and 15copies of &quot;Tha Communist Review&quot; in his locker:  he saia thathe had received these from a &quot;stranger&quot; who boarded the shipon September  25th and to whom he gave a receipt in the name ofthe SeamenTs  International Union.

Elections.&quot;      The British Bureau is continuing its  efforts to capture the engineering and shipbuilding unions:   a group of extreme engineers  in London has joined forces with a similar group  of the Electrical  Trades  Union:   a  meeting of the two sections,                                               attended/
     attended inter alia by Jaok Tanner, R.Short, Frank: Smith,     W.licitino k.nd J.F.Wy itt, was held at the offices of the Electric     oal Trades Union on September 29th and adopted, with  slight     alteration, the programme drawn up by J.T.Murphy and  quoted in     Report No .173.          The price of &quot;The Worker&quot; is to be reduced to a  penny in  .     November and J.E.Campbell is making a strong bid for  the support     of the unemployed in Scotland:  he has urged upon committees     that his paper will be of far more use to them than &quot;a number     of small papers struggling to survive&quot;:  this applies no doubt     to Alec geddes &quot;Searchlight&quot;&apos;, which seems likely to  become a     dangerous rival to &quot;The Worker&quot;.gag UITEMPLOYED          Owing to the presence of communists in London this week,     there has been less activity among the unemployed, although     there are indications that the various local committees are     continuing the work of organisation.   Haye, Hannington and Holt     have been discussing policy with Tom Bell, Inkpin and McManus,     who on October 6th gave them  25 as they complained of the     financial difficulties of the. movement:  a committee has been     set up to co-ordinate&apos; the activities of the unemployed and the     communists In London.          Geddes of Greenock and Douglas of Dundee spoke at a meet-     ingheld in Trafalgar Square on October 8th to protest against     the sentence of Pallas, who is serving a term of nine months&quot;     imprisonment:   about 500 people were present and the  speakers     dwelt chiefiy. upon the &quot;Injustice&quot; of the sentence.          The. Chief-Constable of Sate she ad informs me that on     October 3rd a procession of some 300 unemployed marched through     the town while, a deputation waited on the Guardians, who, how-                                          -                 ever/
 ever refused an Interview..   On the following day about 500 unemployed assembled in Benoham Road to prevent the tfouuty Court Bailiffs executing a warrant of distraint;  there was, however,&apos; no disorder and a settlement subsequently reached allowed the present holders of tho goods to remain in posses- sion of them.      Attempts are being made to re-organise the xuiemployed in Scotland on the basis of municipal wards:  the scheme has been starred in Paisley, Greeneok, Falkirk and Renfrew.      The paid  sssantiS   of the Republicans are actively endeavour- ing to collect and transport war material for their fighting units in Ireland,,   A Republican &quot;Captain&quot; Moore,  said to be a tramway employee in Dublin, is at present visiting London, Liverpool, Manchester and other tov/ns for the purpose of stirring things up:  he is also to arrange a courier service on the lines of that instituted by Sinn Fein in pre-*Treaty days.      Art 0TBrien is still endeavouring to push forward his section of the Irish Self&quot;Determination League as  the one and only genuine patriotic organisation, but is meeting with very litole stuooss:  he has appointed a committee consisting of Miss Io  Kennedyf  Miss Nellie Barrett,  Mr.  P.Bc.0 1Harts, Dr. 0lConnor,  the Misses Kelly,  Miss  0*Sullivan, Mite  Daly, Mr, Ennis and  others.      Financial matters are troubling him greatly:   he owes- ,300 for the rent  of the league offices in Shaftesbury Avenue, and  the  secession of practically  the whole of the  Provincial Branches has reduced his funds almost  to vanishing point.      During the week Roderick Connolly,  president  of the Commr.uist  Party of Ireland,  spoke  at a communist meeting in                                                     London/
 London on the  use  of street &quot;barricades in ireland a   A man named  Jackson  also spoke and said  that as Connolly had taken an  active part in  the  revolution in Ire land 9  especially in street fighting, he  would be a capital man to lead the re- volutlonary  forces here  when the time  arrivedB     Apparently all  communists do  not  think so highly of Connollyxs abilities.  Sylvia Pankhurst in a  letter to Countess Markievicz  offers to help in  promoting propaganda in  aid of the  Republic and says the sympathy  and aid of the Communist Party are  at the disposal of the Irish - Republicans, but  she  warns  the  Countess that several of the heads of the move me lit in  this country are not. in accord with the tactics of  Connolly, who is  best left to himself^     She Liverpool &quot;Daily Post&quot; and the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; devoted  space-during the week to !T.P*0*Connor*s .proposal for a new  Irish  organisation in this country.,   The former journal  asks &quot;in what  way are the  political interests ofEnglishmen and  Irishmen  at Westminster not Identical?&quot; The &quot;Catholic  Herald&quot;, however,,  goes farther  a;a5  not only- objects  to 3L P.0*Connor-s proposal but uhxnks Irish organ!sa- tions  of any kind  are  oat of place in  this country at present it also  takes  serious  objection to both the Free  State League and P*JoITellyTs Irish  SeIf-.Determination  League  in  the Northand thinks both are  unnecessary 0     She Republican  split in Scotland  is  still unhealed.Several meetings of  the  leaders  of both wings have  been heldwithout  arriving at  an agreement and another  was  arranged for october  11th,     On October 4th  James Graham.  Joseph Reilly,  WilliamCanon  and Philip Gallan were arrested  for  attempting to stealarms&quot; from the  drill hall  in Brandon Terrace..

      Patrick Lavin,  the communist secretary to the Scottish Labour College,  who  spent from January to July, 19.82* visiting Germany and  Russia studying,  as he says,  the educational and  industrial systems of those countries, has a long  article in  the  &quot;Workers1  Republic&quot; of October 7th, head- ed:   &quot;Communists and  the   Irish Struggle&quot;^   He contends that the fight  for a  Republic  in Ireland is one which should ap- peal  to  the Communist Party and quotes Lenin!s thy sic on the national  question at  the  Second Congress of the Communist In- temational:           &quot;Direct assistance must be  given by all      Communist Parties to  the  revolutionary movements      of  subject  peoples (for axanrple  - Ireland )i..a           &quot;Wo must, fon*raulate a policy  having for its      object The  closest possible  bond  between Soviet      Russia and  all mo sremeats  for national frewdoma&quot;      Before going to  Germany,  Lavin lived at 173.-  Thomson Street, Denis^jjoun, Glasgow j. where he  had as a lodgerLePr/vuilsh;  alias Mitchell;,  alias  Dunn,  a notorious SinnPe iner.
