The following visits were paid:-     County Commandant, R.U.S.C. Omagh.     0*0., Troops   Omagh     B.U.C.,  eah.     B.U.S...C   Clonnelly House (near pettigoe)     0.0., Troops, Irvinestown.

There were no signs  of tension, and the state of public opinion appeared to be  quite normal.   There is a certain amount of apprehension  regarding the proposed reductions in the R,U.S.C, both  from the point of view of the reduced protection which will  be available, ana on account of the resultant increase in  the numbers of unemployed.3.        Hsppior relations than usual appeared to exist  between people of different shades of political and  religious opinion.   This is attributable to three main  oauses -  (a)   The recent period of peaceful and stable conditions  which had been enjoyed by all classes in northern Ireland.  (bj   Widely held belief that the forces of law and order  are in the ascendant, South of the Border.  (o)   The influence of Officers and men of the British Army.4.        The following incidents, though of little  Importance in themselves, were being much discussed by  inhabitants, of the Border Counties, and produced an  excellent effect, on the lines referred to in para. 3.
(a)     &quot;When the late Mr. Collinfs fiancee was. recentlysearched by Special Constables, on the train by -which shewas travelling entering Co. Fermanagh, she stated that afew months ago she hated the specials, but that novs shelooked upon them m friends, being representatives of lawand order and stable Government.   She spoke bitterlyabout her lawless countrymen who had murdered her fiancee,and she looked forward to the peace and quiet of northernIreland.(b)     An unreliable Speoial Constable recently   :deserted1, and attempted to  join, the Free State forces inClones,   He was however rejected by the forces in Clones,and after being derived of  his aims was sent back acrossthe Border into Northern Territory.        Public opinion treats this Incident as evidence that the Free State Forces intend to behave withdignity and do not propose  to become a dumping ground forother peoples1  undesirables.        Similar action has  already been taken byBorthern Forces in the case of deserters from the South.(c)     2 robbers recently  held up a Bank employeewho was travelling by road  from Clones to Lisnaskea.   Thehold up occurred in Northern Territory,  northern policefailed to catoh the robbers before they were able to make good their escape aoroes the Border -  polios ForcesSouth of the Border have however arrested two men who are strongly suspected of - being those concerned in the affair,and have  offered, to hand them over to the northern Policefor disposal.        This is evidence of useful co-operation between theforces of lava and order on  both sides of the Border.(d)  ..  At a dinner party in the Officer&apos;a Moss ofthe Hampshire Regiment on September 7th.,, the ProtestantClergyman-and Roman Catholic Priest of Lienaskoa wereamongst the guests.        It is. understood that prior to that eveningthese two gentlemen were not very well known to each other;but during the evening they became very good friends and left in Company.-     This incident was being favourablycommented upon early next morning fr? &quot;both Protestantsand Roman Catholics resident 6 miles from iLisnaakaa.Much regret is exprossod locally at the Impending departure of the Hampshire Regiment who were stated to have exerteda good influence for peace  and conciliation amongst allclasses of the community.        The discipline and  impartiality of theSpecial Constabulary at the places visited was favourablycommented upon.        There has been no noticeable influx ofIrregulars across the Border,   The recent discovery andcapture by the Tyrone Special Constabulary of a carefullyconcealed dump of munitions in  the Sperrin Mountainsshould have a beneficial, moral, and physical effect uponactivities by Irregulars.n^mfDTw             (SIGHED)   W.M.
