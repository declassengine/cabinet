[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government-;]Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1922.SECRET.CP. 4224.                                 CABINET.DRAFT  PROCLAMATION AUTHORISING THE  REQUISITION                         OF  SHIPPING.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    I HAVE  read the Note by the Secretary of the Board of Trade (CP. 4199) asto the requisition of shipping to meet transport requirements.    I notice that the Draft Proclamation submitted by the Board of Trade providesfor the requisition  of &quot; any British  ship or British vessel  as  defined  in  theMerchant Shipping Act of 1894.&quot;   This wording is wide  enough to include shipsregistered in the self-governing Dominions, though I understand that the Board ofTrade had in fact no intention of requisitioning such ships.    I think that it would  be well, in view of constitutional developments  duringthe war, definitely to exclude from the Proclamation, if its issue becomes necessary,the power to requisition ships  registered in  the  self-governing  Dominions.  Thequestion has been discussed  with  the  Board of  Trade, who raise no objection tothe inclusion in the Draft Proclamation of words making the necessary provision.On the assumption that this  coarse is  approved, it has been agreed between  theColonial Office and the Board of  Trade that the following words should be addedafter &quot; The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 &quot; :-   &quot;with the  exception  of any  British ship or British vessel registered  in  our    Dominion  of  Canada, our Commonwealth  of Australia,  our Dominion of    New Zealand,  our Union of South  Africa and our Island of Newfoundland.&quot;    I also  understand from  the Board of Trade that if an emergency arises whichnecessitates the issue  of the Proclamation,  it will be  essential  to  requisition,amongst others, ships  normally  trading  between the  United Kingdom and  theDominions.   In view of the experience  gained during the war, I feel sure  that itwould be wise to warn  the Dominion Governments beforehand of this contingency,and I annex the draft of a telegram, the terms of which have been agreed with theBoard of Trade, which  I propose to send to the Dominions.                                                                  W.  S. c.    Colonial Office,          September 25, 1922.                 Draft Telegram to Self-Governing Dominions.(Secret.)    Should emergency arise suddenly requiring transport of troops to Near East in large numbers,, intended to issue proclamation conferring on His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment power to requisition the necessary shipping.  In accordance with  constitu-tional  practice followed during the war, proclamation will be so woi&apos;ded as to exclude from  requisition ships registered in the self-governing Dominions.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government think, however, that your Ministers should know beforehandthat if emergency is severe it will be necessary to take up at shortest notice vesselsregistered here  with large-third class  accommodation,  or  which can be readilyfitted for troops, and that this category includes some  vessels trading regularlybetween  United  Kingdom and  Dominions.   Similar  telegram  sent  to  otherDominions.[8908]
