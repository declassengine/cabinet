With a view to promoting the development of the procedure of conciliation in the case ofinternational disputes, in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant, the Assembly recommendsthe Members of the heague, subject to the rights and obligations mentioned in Article 15 of theCovenant, to conclude agreements with the object of laying their  disputes before ConciliationCommissions formed by themselves.    The organisation of these  Commissions, their competence and the procedure to be followedbefore them, shall be freely determined by the Contracting Parties.  The Parties are recommended in this connection to look for guidance to the provisions contained in the Hague Convention ofOctober 18th,  1907, for the pacific settlement of international disputes, and, in particular, to theprovisions concerning  the hearing of witnesses,  procedure by employment of  experts, rogatorycommissions, inspection of  places, replacement  of members of the Commission.   The rules laiddown in the following  Articles are recommended to them for adoption.   At the request of theMembers concerned, the Secretary-General may offer them the assistance of the Secretariat forthe conclusion of Conciliation Conventions.    Apart from the other means placed at its disposal  by the Covenant to assure the maintenanceof peace, the Council may, if necessary, have recourse to the service of the Conciliation Commissionformed  by the Parties ; it may invite them to  bring their dispute before the  Commission,  or itmay refer to the Commission any dispute which may have been submitted to it by one of the parties in virtue of Article 15 of the Covenant.  A Conciliation Convention made between two States ofwhich one only is a Member of the  League of Nations, or of which neither is a Member of theLeague, will be applicable subject to the procedure established by Article 17 of the Covenant.    The Assembly expresses the hope that the competence of Conciliation Commissions will extend to the greatest possible number of disputes, and that  the practical application  of particular  Con-ventions between States, as recommended in the present resolution, will in the near  future make possible the establishment of a general Convention open to the  adhesion of all States.    The Conciliation Commission shall be constituted as follows :     Each  Party shall appoint two members, one from among its own nationals, the other from among the nationals of a third State.  The two Parties shall jointly appoint the Chairman of theCommission from among the nationals of a third State.    The Parties may appoint the members of the Commission beforehand and for a period whichthey themselves shall determine.  They may also confine themselves to appointing only the Chair-man beforehand, in which case the other members shall be appointed after consultation with theChairman  at the moment when a dispute arises, their mandate being  limited to the settlement ofsuch dispute.    Disputes which fall within the competence of the Conciliation Commission shall be referred toit for consideration by means of a notification made bj&apos; one of the Contracting Parties to the Chair-man of the Commission and to the other Party. The notification shall be communicated to  theSecretary-General of the  League.RULES.Article 1.Article 2.S. d. N. IX/22 1250. Imprimerie Renaud.
