September  1922.CONFIDENTIAL.CP.-1231.                                                          ^ -:  &apos;&apos;(CABINET.THE LEAGUE  OF  NATIONS AND  THE  SITUATION  IN THE                          NEAR EAST. Summary of the Discussion at the Meeting of the Sixth Committee of the Assembly     of the League of Nations, held on September 22, on a Proposal that the League     of Nations should use its good  offices to  secure  the  immediate Cessation of     Hostilities in the Near East.                          (Circulated for Information.)                 THE NINTH MEETING OF THE SIXTH COMMITTEE.     THE  Sixth  Committee held  its  ninth meeting yesterday (Friday)  at 4 P.M, under the chairmanship of Jonkheer Loudon. The Position in the Near East: Proposal of Dr.  Nansen.     DR. NANSEN (Norway) begged to move the following resolution :          &quot; The assembly resolves to request the council to consider what steps it could     take on behalf of the League of Nations, whether  by offering its good offices to     the  belligerent  parties or otherwise,  to secure  the  immediate cessation of     hostilities in the Near East.&quot;     Dr.  Nansen, presenting this  resolution, argued that  it was  the duty of the League to  take action in accordance with article 3 and article 11 of the  Covenant, The war in the Near East was a  matter of concern to the whole League,  and the League was bound to take any action which might prove wise and effectual to bring hostilities to an end.     He proposed in  his resolution that  the council should consider what  could  and ought to be done.     There was a group of Powers  which was endeavouring to arrange a settlement, and these negotiations might lead to a successful result. He thought, however, that the council would have to play a direct part in these negotiations.  The council might invite the two parties to a conference to be held under the auspices of the League, at which the  council, either as a whole  or through a sub-committee, might act as  a mediator.  For this purpose, both parties should be treated on a footing of complete equality, and the  Government of  Angora would necessarily be  invited,  under the provisions  of article  17  of  the   Covenant,  to  accept the rights and  duties of membership of the League while a settlement-was being prepared.     SIR JOSEPH COOK (Australia) congratulated Dr. Nansen on his motion,  and said he would like to see it strengthened.  People in Australia found it difficult to understand why the League of Nations,  with  its council, its  secretariat and the various technical bodies at its disposal, should be unable to do anything when faced with a crisis in European affairs.     The countries which were negotiating a settlement were represented on the Council of the League, but they apparently preferred to act not through the League but in some other way and in some other place.  No doubt there were difficulties. Turkey was still at war with the Allies.  Negotiators were actually at work trying to restore peace.  Precipitate and unwise action  might make matters worse.     Was it not, however, possible to ask the League of Nations to ascertain the facts of the position and to set them forth fairly and dispassionately ?  Negotiations might      [8915]
 be begun after the facts were ascertained.   The League had no material force, but public opinion was behind it, and,  if this public opinion were  instructed, it would prove to be an important factor.     The League might further  undertake to define the boundaries of a neutral zone and to supervise the Straits.     Dr. Nansen had said that the matter would have to come to the League when the negotiators had finished their work.   Why should not the assistance of the League be asked in the  beginning ?   Thus it might be  possible to avoid the mistake, made in Paris and at Genoa, of arranging an imperfect settlement and  handing over to the &quot;League the problems which remained.     PRINCE ARFA-ED-DOWLEH  (Persia) said that Persia was particularly interested in  the rapid  conclusion  of  the  war.   HA had  asked the assembly to intervene  in  the  previous  year.  It- might  then have been believed that he was speaking on behalf of Turkey and  the,Moslems,  but yesterday and to-day his sole concern was with humanity at  large.   The  war had  gone on with  no other result than an increase in the number  of its victims.  Turkey was not  now  the only nation concerned.  Millions of Moslems  turned towards Turkey and awaited the issue of the conflict.   It was necessary  to act wisely.  Certain nations  were to be thanked for their policy in the East, in particular, France and  Italy.   If every country were inspired with the  spirit of the Covenant, peace might be restored. The adoption of the proposal  of Dr. Nansen would, if necessary,  permit the  League of Nations usefully to intervene.     MR.  TCHEOTJ-WEI (China)  asked for what purpose  the League had been established if it were not in order to do something for the suppression of war, which had inspired terror, in the hearts of the nations.  China brought  with her the modest assistance  of  its 400,000,000 of inhabitants in  order  to safeguard  the  principles defined in  the Covenant.   It was impossible for the League of Nations  to remaini&apos; indifferent to the  horrors of a war  which was being  indefinitely prolonged.   The Chinese Government approved the proposal of Dr. Nansen.  ; MR. FISHER  (British Empire) said he wished  to express his gratitude  to Dr. Nansen  for bringing  up this grave international question.  The League  of Nations was  an  association to prevent war,  and  could not watch unmoved the continuation or extension of the present war  in the Near East.  The exact terms  of the resolution to be adopted by the committee were not, however, of great importance. If should express  the grave anxiety with which the League  of  Nations viewed the present situation, and the desire  of the League that hostilities should cease  and peace be established,. It should, however, be noted that  the negotiations, were in  the hands of certain Powers, and that it was not well to perplex  these, negotiations,  which,  so far, were progressing satisfactorily.    The League should express its willingness to  render any  assistance for which it might be asked, either during the present negotiations or in the event of their failure. The League  was  in an  excellent position  to assist  owing to. the international atmosphere which  prevailed at  Geneva,  and  the  possession of  a permanent machinery.    He  begged to submit  to the  committee a  resolution  which embodied  these considerations :          &quot; The assembly views with dismay the possibility of the  prolongation of the    war in  the.  Near  East.   It notes with satisfaction the  announcement of a    conference at which the interested Powers will be represented, and it trusts/that    the council will be prepared, as  the occasion  demands, to render any assistance    which  may be invited by the negotiating Powers  towards the attainment of a    prompt and durable peace.&quot;    The British Government was anxious to  secure the co-operation of the League, and believed that the League would  be able to assist in a durable settlement.  The British Government recognised and  shared the hope of the British Dominions that-the League would be able to take a prominent share in the restoration  of peace, andwas ready to afford facilities as the occasion might demand.    LORD, ROBERT CECIL (South Africa)  said there were dangers and difficultieseither, in action or in a failure to act.  There! was, however, a war in  progress, andit was the  duty of the League to  take wise  and effective, action under article 11,unless there were  very good reasons for refraining.  Emir   Zoka^ed-Dowleh had
already drawn  attention to one of  the  great  difficulties.  The League had  notintervened last year when the Greeks were victorious, which did not make it easy forthe League to intervene now that the  Turks were victorious.     Action must be left to the council.  There was no desire that the council shouldtake action which would add to the difficulties of the situation, and it was vital thatthe League should do nothing to injure its chances of success if, in the event of thefailure of  the present negotiations,  it became the duty of the League to mediate.There was a phrase in the  resolution presented by Mr. Fisher which was open tomisconstruction,  particularly  by  the  Turks.  It was said that the League shouldintervene  at the request of  the negotiating Powers.   Was it intended that Turkeyshould be included among those Powers ?  The resolution would not be so understood.He could not admit the principle that the League could  only act on the invitation ofa group of Powers acting outside the League, and directing the League to take orrefuse  to  take  particular  action.   Such a principle was inadmissible on general grounds, and in this particular case would go far to destro)? the League&apos;s chance ofusefulness.  The League should act as a great international body, independently andof its own  initiative.     He did not  consider that there was any objection to accepting the resolution of dr. Nansen as it stood.     M. HANOTALTX (France)  felt  it was necessary  to  avoid the  appearance ofanticipating a failure in the  negotiations which  were  then  proceeding.   The firstlesults of the negotiations in progress had promised well for the future.   It would suffice to lay down that the council should vigilantly watch  the position,  and holditself ready to assist.  For this reason he approved the  proposal of Mr. Fisher.     THE  MARQUIS  IMPERIALI (Italy) said the  discussion had shown thateveryone was agreed on  the substance of the question.  He agreed completely withthe formula submitted by Mr. Fisher and approved by the French representative.This formula  brought the duties of the League of Nations into harmony with therequirements of the situation.  It would facilitate the work of peace.     M. RADEFF  (Bulgaria) said that Bulgaria was  happy to  see the sphere ofaction of the League of Nations enlarged and its prestige increased.   He hoped that negotiations would be conducted in a way that would enable account to be taken ofall the interests at stake.  Bulgaria was particularly interested in the solution of theEastern question,  for  there were Bulgarian elements in the regions whose destinyhad  to be decided, and Bulgaria, disarmed by the treaties, wras a. country adjacent to these regions, where war might at any moment break out. Whatever might be thecourse of events, Bulgaria, would not depart from a loyal neutrality, but, as she wasnot in a position to compel respect for her neutrality, she was placed in an unhappyposition.   She hoped that peace would be restored, if necessary with the assistanceof the council, whose intervention could not cause anxiety to anyone.     M. G. STREIT  (Greece) pointed  out that Greece had accepted  offers  ofmediation  in 1921, and proposals for  an armistice in March 1922.   Greece had keptfaith at the cost of great sacrifices,  because  of her duty  towards  the  Greeks,Armenians and all  the oppressed  populations of Asia  Minor.   He  thanked hiscolleagues, particularly the  delegates of Persia  and South Africa, for their efforts on  behalf  of  peace.  The  declarations of the representatives of the  three  great powers promised well for the future.  Greece had  confidence in the result of thenegotiations, and in the possible  intervention of the council.     VISCOUNT ISHII (Japan) noted that virtual agreement had been reached.There was no difference of opinion as to the object to be achieved, and the difference in regard to the steps which  should be taken did not go very far.  He thought that itmight meet the various views which had been put forward if a sentence were addedto the resolution submitted by Mr. Fisher, expressing confidence that the Council ofthe League would take all proper measures, justified by the circumstances,  with aview to giving  effect  to the  unanimous desire  of  the assembly  for  the promptestablishment of peace.     MR. FISHER (British  Empire) said he thought  the committee were agreed thatthere should be no interference with the negotiations which were proceeding for thesettlement  of the Near East.  There was, however, a desire that the League shouldintervene if it could usefully do so, either while the conference was in progress or ifthe negotiations should break down.  There was a difference of opinion as to whetherthe League should await the inyitation of the interested Governments.  He agreed
with Lord Robert Cecil that nothing should be done to  injure the prestige of theLeague, or to prejudice its intervention.  He feared, however, that it might lead toa breakdown of the present  negotiations if  there were  an immediate prospect ofconcurrent negotiations taking place under the auspices of the League.    He suggested that the various proposals which had been brought forward shouldbe submitted to a drafting committee with instructions to prepare a text for furtherconsideration.    DR. NANSEN (Norway) said he accepted the proposal of Mr.  Fisher.  He notedthat the committee was unanimously agreed  in recognising that  it  was confronted with a question which interested the whole League, and in inviting the council toact if it should be requested  to do so.  It might be assumed that, if the resolutionwere adopted, the council, which included representatives of the three Great powers at present engaged in the negotiations,  would do nothing calculated to encountertheir opposition.    M. HANOTAUX (France) congratulated the committee on the progress whichhad been made towards unanimous agreement.  His chief concern had been to keep-within the limits of a procedure which had already, as in the case of Upper Silesiaand of Austria, shown excellent results.    THE MARQUIS IMPERIAL! (Italy)  and LORD ROBERT CECIL (SouthAfrica) supported  the proposal that a drafting committee should draw up a text for submission to the commission.    The committee decided  that the  drafting  committee should be composed asfollows ;  Lord  Robert  Cecil  (South   Africa), Mr.  Fisher  (British  Empire),M.  Hanotaux  (France),  the Marquis  Imperial! (Italy), Viscount Ishii  (Japan).Jonkheer Loudon (Netherlands) and Dr. Nansen (Norway).o
