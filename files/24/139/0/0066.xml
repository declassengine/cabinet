THE CABINET.REPORT  ON THE  SITUATION IN IRELAND  FOR THE WEEK                    ENDING 30th SEPTEMBER, 1922.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.    I circulate the report on  the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 30th September,  1922.                                                                        L.  W.-E.  THE WAR OFFICE,        7 th October, 1922.                                SOUTHERN IRELAND.     (a)  Dublin. On the whole the past week has been quieter than usual in the Dublinarea.  The only ambush of importance took place on the afternoon of 27th September  inParliament Street when two Provisional Government soldiers in a lorry and two civilianpassers-by were wounded.     About 10 p.m. on 30th September, Mr.  P.  Cosgrave,  uncle of the  Chairman of theProvisional Government, was murdered in a public house  in  Dublin by members of  an armed gang who were apparently intending to rob the till.   The coroner&apos;s jury yesterdaybrought in a verdict of wilful murder against the unknown assassins.     The Southern Irish postal strike came to an end on 29th September, the terms of thesettlement being those offered  by the Provisional Government on the eve of  the  strike  on 9th  September.   The  firmness shown  by  Mr.  Cosgrave&apos;s Government  has  certainlyenhanced its reputation.   Another indication  of  strong government was the approval inprinciple by the Dail by 48 votes against 18  of the institution of military courts with powers to punish offenders with death, penal servitude, imprisonment and  fines.   this new Bill having been discussed in committee on  28th September, the drawing-up of thenecessary  regulations  is now,  presumably, being  carried  out, and,  provided  these regulations are placed on the  table of the  Dail and are not amended within four sittingdays, they will come into force.  These military courts will each have as member at  least one person, to be  given military rank, of legal experience.     These strong measures, which are aimed at all persons taking up arms against lawfulauthority, or who are found in possession of  arms  without a permit,  or who take part  inthe destruction  or looting of public and private  property,  are undoubtedly copied  fromthose carried out by the  Imperial  authorities in 1920-21.  In those days they  were described invariably by the Irish Press, and even by some  British newspapers, as brutaland tyrannical.   Now they are welcomed by the whole Press of Great Britain and ireland as necessary and just.  Whether these new courts will  really be  effective, or whether thewhole policy is  political bluff, remains to be seen.     There is much public speculation as to the &quot; island&quot; on which the ProvisionalGovernment intend to locate their prisoners.   Some people think that the  larger of theSaltee Islands, off the Wexford coast, will  be selected ; others that Lambay Island, on theeast coast of Co. Dublin, will be chosen.  It is interesting to note that in  the 17th centuryEngland kept about 1,600 Irish rebels on  Lambay and that  these were released  after theTreaty of Limerick.     (b)  Outside  Dublin. The areas of Republican military activity are still Co. Kerry,North West Cork, and, in a slightly less decree, Co. Mayo.   Attempts are being made  todeal with the Kerry situation ; but it would appear that Commandant General Lynch whohas  lately been appointed to the new Provisional Government &quot; Kerry Command &quot; is stillshort of troops.  Naval wireless messages from  Haulbowline  received last  night reportthat General Lynch is on his way from  Tralee  by sea to Dublin and that he (Lynch)states that in a  strong  Republican  attack  on the Provisional  Government garrison  ofKillorglin,  Co. Kerry, on the  night of 27th/28th  September, twenty-three Republicanswere killed and 30 captured.   The Commander ol; the Provisional  Government garrison     (B22/264) 100  10/22 W.O.P. 403
 was killed and 4 men wounded.   Other official accounts state that the Republicans, who were pursued by relieving troops from Tralee, suffered 80 casualties, killed, wounded and prisoners, in this engagement.  It is understood that  it  is intended to  drive the Dingle peninsula, but that, owing to the shortage of  troops, the drive has  been postponed.      The week-end has witnessed an  encircling  movement  by Provisional Government troops   in  Co.  Tipperary  in which  28 prisoners  were  taken;  also attacks by  the Republicans on the garrisons of Ballyhaunis, Swinford and  Ballinrobe, all in Co. Mayo, resulting in the repulse of the attackers without casualties  amongst the defenders.   Two, of the  above  incidents  would appear  to  show that  the Provisional  Government troops have made some little headway during the past week in  the more disturbed  areas of the south-west.      A  new paper  has lately been  published by the Provisional  Government military authorities ; this is the Iris an Airm (The Army Bulletin).   From extracts given in the Dublin Press it  appears to be a propaganda sheet giving accounts of actions, extracts from captured documents, total of arms captured, &amp;c.      The Republican sheet Poblacht na h-Eireann  claims the following casualties as having been inflicted on the Provisional Government troops up to the middle  of September : -                       Killed,  230.                      Wounded,  738.                      Prisoners,  2,000.      The following wireless stations  have been opened by the  Provisional Government ; they use a .1,400-metre wave  length :                       Portobello  Barracks, Dublin.                      Athlone.                      Limerick.                      Kilkenny.                                        ,                      Cork.                      Drumboe Castle, Stranorlar (Co. Donegal).  -      Among  the better class of Provisional  Government soldiers  in the  Dublin and Curragh areas there is a growing  feeling of disgust with their army.   Both the  Republicans and the ex-officers and ex-soldiers in the Provisional Government forces, are watching the Near Eastern situation with interest.   The former think that our difficulties  would make many of their sympathisers active Republicans, whilst the latter see in another war the chaiice of leaving the Provisional Government to rejoin the British Army.                                 NORTHERN IRELAND.      As a whole, the situation in the Six  Counties has  been  quiet during the past week. There has been  a  certain amount of  I. li.A. activity in the counties, and police patrols have, on several  occasions, come  in contact with bodies of armed  civilians.   Casualties, however, have been slight.      In Belfast  there  has been   a decrease in the casualty list, and only two deaths are reported.   There have, however, been several cases of sniping and  indiscriminate  firing, though as  yet there  is  no  sign of an  organized outbreak on either side.   The two casualties were both  caused by Crown forces, the one accidentally and the other in the execution of  their duty.      Three Catholics were wounded in the city during the past week-end.      Along the border it is reported that there is a considerable  amount of uneasiness and, in Fermanagh, further kidnapping raids are feared.   At Belleek several incidents tend to show that the Republicans are on the alert and that  their morale is gradually improving. Police  patrols have been fired on in one or two instances, but have suffered no casualties.                            VV.  MAXWELL  SCOTT,  Colonel,                                                   For General,                                                      Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.    General Headquarters,          Dublin,               3rd October, 1922.
                                                               3 3 t.i          Last year I proposed, an Empire and Home DevelopmentLoan for a 100 million pounds, which I still think could heraised and which judiciously expended would produce a large volume of work with beneficial results to our Trade afterwards.This proposal was turned down, and I am sorry to note that theone fruitful suggestion that the Cabinet Committee arrived at,namely, that the Government should not merely guarantee, butthat it should also grant loans, has again been rejected.          In my opinion the terms of reference to the TradeFacilities Committee are too narrow and the spirit animatingthe Committee is directed mainly to making certain that in no circumstances should any loss  fall on the Exchequer in thestimulation of trade, which was the purpose for which theCommittee was originally created.   It is useless to think of Empire development unless a financial policy of much greatercourage and larger vision is adopted than has been the case inthe past.   An administrative measure necessary to accelerate theexecution of schemes is the appointment of a strong and authoritative executive officer whose duty it shall be to follow up the decisions of the Cabinet and Its Committees on unemployment and ensure that the Cabinet is kept fully informed of the progressmode  in  carrying out such  decisions.          In regard to Home Development and especially Landdevelopment, one of the essential factors Is cheap transport.   Inthis country I believe the large modern motor lorry is the best means of handling the produce of the small farms and the smallholders.   In order to develop this means of transport theconstruction and improvement of our roads should proceed with much greater speed than is possible on the present financial basis.   To my mind the right thing to do would be boldly to issue a Road Lean anywhere up to  50,000,000, secured on the revenue of the Roads Board income which would enable road construction to be
undertaken on a much &quot;bigger and more systematic scale than atpresent, and would, incidentally, give employment to a verylarge number of people,          I should add that I have already put thi3 suggestionbefore the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofTransport who has made technical criticisms of the proposal which would require consideration .        At the meeting of the Trade Policy Committee held onthe 28th August, it was decided that a memorandum on theapplication of unemployment benefit as a subsidy in aid ofwages on relief works undertaken by local authorities or statutory bodies who do not trade for profit  (T,P0ll) shouldbe considered by  a  Sub-Committee.   This Sub-Committeehas not yet met.   I think that my proposals  should be takeninto consideration without delay, and I urge  that the Sub-Committee should be requested at the same time to review my proposals for extending this assistance to private profit-earning undertakings (Vide C.P.,4135).   In spite of the factthat there are great difficulties and objections in connectionwith the extension of such assistance to private enterprise,yet in view of the fact that our unemployment figures are showing such a very unsatisfactory reduction, while the intensity of distress among the unemployed population is growing, I think the proposals are worthy  of review.          A further tr eposal of mine which, though not expressly directed to tho relief of unemployment, would, if carried into operation have the effect of reducing unemploymentin the building trade, is one for a continuation in a modified form, of the Government Housing Scheme as outlined in my recent memorandum (T*?.39).  I should like an early decision on this proposal in order that fresh buildingcan immediately be put in hand, and unemployment in thebuilding trade be thereby relieved.,
Local Government and Health.          It has been suggested that the Maclean Report whichproposed the abolition of Poor Law Guardians should form partof our programme.   I would point out that in view of the great difficulties existing in the administration of Poor Law at thepresent moment It is doubtful whether this is the right timeto adopt such a policy;  It would create an immense amount of opposition among a large body of local government people, and i fear would create no enthusiasm among the electors generally.Rating Refprmt          A Cabinet Committee prepared a report on Rating ReformBwhich would I think be generally acceptable, although the subject is not a popular one, but it would please Local Authoritiesgenerally.   I want to suggest for consideration the question of placing part of our rates on site values in Urban Areas, on thebasis of the valuation already made.   All classes, especially the industrial classes, realise more and more the injustice ofa form of rating which penalises the construction of houses,factories, &amp;c, or the making of improvements of any kind.   Thediscussion on the Rating of machinery Bill has brought this pointvery forcibly to my mind.   This question will be taken up either by the Wee Frees or the Labour Party if we don&apos;t take it up,and it is a very powerful platform point particularly since the taxes on undeveloped land have disappeared.   All the argumentswe used ivi favour of those taxes with such e ffect in 1910 can beused equally and even more strongly where rating is concerned.Rent Restriction Act.          This will be a burning issue at any Election.   I have promised the House of Commons to give some declaration ofGovernment policy as to the continuance of this Act when the Housemeets again.   I do not think it will be possible to repeal the
Act under the present circumstances.   Modifications willbe required.   The question o.&quot; how far a PAIR RENT Courtcould be substituted and made a more permanent measure should think be discussed.  I think such a proposal could bejustified on grounds that it was an essential necessity thathouses should be available to meet the needs of the population.It is impossible for the average working man to providehimself with a house of his own under present economic conditions,and he should be able to rent a house on a fair economic basis,                           A, MOND                             5.10.22.Ministry of Health.
