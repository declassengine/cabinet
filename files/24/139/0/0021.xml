POLITICAL.        Telegram from Lord Hardinge  (Paris).                 &quot;D.  11030 p,rn.  23rd  September,  1922.                 R.  10,40 a.ma  24th  September,  1822,        No.        (BUBAS, )     Following from Lord  Curzon for the Cabinet.     I am very grateful for  wide liberty given to mein your instructions.   I at once attended meeting atQuai d&apos;Orsay which lasted for four hours, and resultedin preparation and signature of joint note which was communicated to press  at  8.30 p.m. and will presumablyappear in London papers tomorrow.   Cabinet will seethat every one of  its  desiderata was obtained, althoughFrench idiom - that being language of note - compelleddeparture from exact words of English formula as originally framed,   In two  respects I refrained fromgoing as far as I was authorised.   Firstly by specificmention of MaritBa boundary instead of geographicalarea of Eastern Thrace, I was able to save for Greececonsiderable slice of  Eastern Thrace between that river and Bulgarian frontier, v/hich may be useful lever tothem in conference discussions,   Secondly by reirain-ing from naming a  precise line to which Greek troops will presently be  asked to retire, some latitude willbe left to allied  commanders in projected meeting at                                            Mudania,
                       (2)8Mudania, to make whatever arrangements  ire thoughtbest.   On the other hand, conditions imposed uponKernalists are very precise:  and a phrase was intro-               f orduced prGviding/demilitarisation of various zonesunspecified,a point which I had forgotten in mydraft,   A sentence was also added about admissionof Turkey to League of Nations,   I declined to allow the Mudania meeting to be converted into anything buta military conference on a single and narrowly definedpoint.     It is of course possible that Kemal may endeavours-our to -secure suspension of reinforcements or with&quot;drawal of Eritish troops as a condition of attendingpeace conference.   But no legitimate loophole forthis is left in text of note; and it can therefore be resisted and refused on its own merits, .     In expectation that I would not meet him on sub-ject of Thracian frontierj Poincare had prepared anote for despatch by the French alone.   This contain-ed declarations of wider compass.   Nevertheless Ithink he was greatly relieved to find that a singlepronouncement was possible;  and I believe that french government are genuinely anxious, for reasons of self interest, to see the invitation accepted andthe conference summoned.     Sforza lent no aid throughout the proceedings,and was little beyond a shadow in wake of the French.Had it been possible to obtain the concurrence ofthe Serbian and Roumanian governments before issueof the note, this would have been done.   But the                                        Serbian
Serbian Ministers have already dispersed, and are notto&quot; meet in Belgrade till Wednesday.   Such a delay would have been disastrous.   Accordingly I proposed and it was agreed to telegraph the test of note tothem at once and express earnest hope that they wouldconcur.     In reply to Prime Minister&apos;s telegram concerningsituation at Constantinople, which did not arrivetill sitting was over, I have -at once telegraphed toGraham at Home requesting Italian government to tele-graph orders to their representative to assist inmaintenance of order,   Poincare is being addressedin same sense-,     I return to London tomorrow and will report to cabinet, if thought desirable on Monday morning.     Lord I lardinge lent me valuable assistance through-Out .
