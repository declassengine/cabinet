The Conference proper was preceded by an Informal meeting on      the 6th October between the expert advisers of the Canadian represen-      tatives and officials of the various British Government Departments      concerned at which the principal proposals of the British Government      were discussed,,   Prom this Conference it was apparent that there      would be only two questions which might present any difficulty,      namely, the suggested imposition of a period of seven days1      observations under veterinary supervision In Canada prior to ship-      ment and the requirement that breeding animals should only be      admitted by order of the Minister of Agriculture under special      regulations to include a tuberculin test and thirty days&apos; V    quarantine in Canada.            The main Conference was opened at the Colonial Office on the      14th October under the Presidency of i;r, Churchill, and after  a      * See Appendix A.             - 1 -
discussion upon the various clauses of the draft Bill prepared bythe Ministry of Agriculture and circulated, prior to the  meeting,to the members of the Conference, the Conference remitted to a small committee of experts the following technical questions:-      1*   &quot;How an effective period of observation of a suitable         length can be instituted without wrecking the trade.&quot;      2,   &quot;How far it is practicable to substitute for the         Canadian proposed word &quot;cattle&quot; the word &quot;steers&quot; defined         as &quot;castrated males or spayed females,&quot;      3.   &quot;What conditions should regulate the importation of         Canadian cattle for breeding purposes.&quot;      4, i&amp;) &quot;What facilities could bo afforded by Canada for        - Imperial inspection in Its territory.&quot;         (b) &quot;Whether inspection is possible during the voyage and,         if so, whether It should be undertaken by Canadian or         Imperial officials.&quot;      5.   &quot;Whether Canadian cattle should he subjected to the         regulations imposed on Irish animals which nor; have to         undergo a period of six days1 detention after sale in an         English market before being distributed elsewhere through         a market or otherwise,&quot;      The Committee of experts met on Monday, 16th October, and  intheir report suggested certain alternative draft clauses  to cover thepoints at issue, but they pointed out that any proposal for a periodof observation in Canada would seriously interfere with the trade from Ontario, and would only be practicable as regards the cattlefrom the Western Provinces if it included the six or seven days*railway journey to the port of embarkations   The Committee were unable to arrive at any agreement as to the terms on which breedinganimals could be admitted without rendering the trade impossibleexcept for highly priced animals.      The main Conference was resumed on Wednesday^ 18th  October,when, After two adjournments to enable the opposing sides to consider their position, agreement was arrived at with the result  that theBritish representatives agreed to reduce the period of observationbefore embarkation in Canada to three days provided that  the CanadianCovernment supplied a veterinary surgeon to accompany each shiploadof cattle*  &apos; In the case of breeding animals, the British represen-tat ives offered to accept a certificate from a veterinary officer of
the Dominion Government that the animals in question have  beeneffectively tested for tuberculosis and are free from that diseasewithout requiring them to undergo any specified period of  quarantineprovided the Canadian Government would reciprocate and impose thesame conditions on British animals imported into Canadaa   As this second requirement involved an important question of policyaffecting Canadian International relations the Canadian representtatives decided that they must communicate with their government before assenting, and the Conference was accordingly adjourned until,Friday, 20th October.      At its third meeting the Conference formally approved the revised draft Bill (Appendix C) which had been prepared embodying the decisions reached at the first and second meetings, and theCanadian representatives stated that their Government were preparedto relinquish their quarantine requirements for cattle imported from Great Britain so soon as the British Government issued anOrder admitting Canadian breeding animals into Great Britain on similar terms.      Up to the present only a brief announcement has been issued to the Press to the effect that the main conditions to govern theimportation of Canadian cattle had been agreed upon and would besubmitted to the new Government,   The National Farmers&apos; Union have,however, urged that British agriculturists should bo informed assoon as possible of the terms of the agreement with the Canadianrepresentatives, especially in view of the General Election.  ThePrime Minister has agreed that a summary of the terms may bepublished and a Press Notice (Appendix B) is being issued in timefor simultaneous publication in thi3 country and in Canada on saturday next the 4th instants                                       R.A.S,                                            2,11,22.

. PRESS NOTICE,IMPORTATION OP CANADIAN CATTLE.          tthas already been announced that  the  British and canadian representatives at the Cattle Conference  agreed as  to thecon.-dons tHat should apply to the importation  of cattle from canada,  The terms will be submitted as soon as  possible for thecom. ideratifcn of the new Cabinet,  but, in the meantime, theGovernment, with the assent Of the Canadian  authorities, hasauthorised the publication of the  following  summary of  the agreement which was arrived at:-               Canadian store cattle (i,e, animals born and          reared in Canada and rendered Incapable  of breeding)          are to be admitted under the following restrictions     (1)  The shipment must be from a Canadian port and direct          to a port In Great Britain.     (2)  For three days Immediately before  shipment and during          the voyage the animals are to be kept  separate from          other animals and periodically examined  by a  veterinary          officer of the Dominion.  A thorough examination          immediately before shipment is to  be made by  the          Dominion veterinary officer, who will certify that the          animals are not affected with cattle plague,  pleuro-          pnevononia, foot-and-mouth disease, or  mange.   During          the voyage the examination is to be made daily.     (3)  The animals are to be landed at specified landing          places and there thoroughly examined by  the Ministry&apos;^          veterinary officers.  Movement from the  landing place          is to be controlled by licence in  the  same manner  as          the movement of imported Irish cattle  is at present          controlled.  This secures detention of the animals          on some farm or other premises for six days,  though          they may pass to such premises through one market.          The agreement makes provision to secure  that  the vesselsused shall not be capable of infecting the cargo and also providesfor effective action if disease should be found  in a cargo.          The landing of Canadiari  cattle capable of breeding willrequire the authority of a General Order which will be  made  by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and laid in  draft before bothHouses of Parliament for thirty days and if  either House before theexpiration of that period presents an address to His Majesty againstthe draft or any part thereof* no  further proceedings shall  be takenthereon.  It is an essential part  of any such Order that the animalsmust be accompanied by a certificate by the  authorised  officer ofthe Dominion stating that the animals have within  one month  beforeshipment been tested effectively for tuberculosis  and found  free from that disease, and the Minister is given the fullest discretion as to the precautions tc be enforced against the Introduction ofother diseases by these animals.          The Minister is to retain the power to suspendimportation of store and breeding  animals if cattle plague,  pleuro*pneumonia, or foot-and-mouth disease should appear, in Canada.
Appendix Bt          A fee not exceeding sixpence an animal is to be  imposed on all imported animals and compensation is not payable in case  of slaughter at the place of landing In consequence ^f disease beingdiscovered.  For administrative purposes imported &quot;animals  are  tobe tagged or otherwise marked.          The Canadian Ministers at the Conference  undertook that as soon as the necessary Crdef4 khthbrlsihg importation of canadian breeding,stock Is in force the Canadian Government willmodify their conditions of importation of British animals  so a^to make the Canadian and British conditions reciprocal.          The Conference assented to the view that  legislation on this subject cannot be limited to Canada but must be capableof adaptation to the requirements of other parts of the BritishEmpire.
