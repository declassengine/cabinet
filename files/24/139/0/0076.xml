II. - Communication to  the International Labour Office                         of  statistical  and other  information  regarding                         emigration and  immigration  and  the repatriation                         and transport of emigrants.          2.         In preparation for the Conference the  International              Labour Office  circulated to Governments a  Questionnaire              on each item of the agenda.   The  replies  of  H,M.              Government wero sent to  Geneva  on  11th August, after              being approved by a Committee of the Cabinet consisting              of the Minister of Education (chairman),  tho Homo              Secretary, the Minister  of Agriculture and Fisheries,  and              myself,  (See  CP. 4145  and Cabinet  Decision of 4th August)          3.         On 7th instant the Ministry  of Labour received from.                                                            /theA.
   .tho  International Labour  Office a report on each  item of the    agenda summarising  the  replies of tho Governments and setting    out  a series  of  conclusions based upon  these replies.    These reports have  been examined by  the Departments concerned,    and  I now circulate a memorandum thereon by Sir Montague    Barlow together  with draft instructions to the British Govern-    ment Delegates to the Conference,4.         Tho Conference opens at Geneva on the 18th  October,    and  It Is necessary that  the instructions to the  British    Delegates should be settled without  delay.   The  draft in-    structions, as is indicated In the memoranda attached, do not    differ materially from  the lines laid down In tho replies to    the  Questionnaire and no  important point of principle is    involved.  I propose,  however, to submit the draft instructions    for  approval, to the members of the  Cabinet Committee who    approved the  replies to the Questionnaire and (unless any    objection Is  offered to this course) when that Committee has    intimated its approval, I will arrange for the instructions    to be sent to Sir Montague Barlow and to Sir David Shaekleton,                                (Sgd.)

Ivlenorandurn. by the Parliamentary Secretary to the                         Ministry of Labour.     A rsx^ort on eaoh of the two items on the Agenda of theConference was received by the Ministry of Labour on 7th instant,In the short time available, full consideration by the Interdepart-mental International Labour Committee has been impossible.  I have,however, oxauiinod the reports in consultation vrlth the Departmentsimmediately concerned, and now submit draft instructions for the guidance at the Conference of Sir David Shackleton and myself.     These draft instructions should be read in conjunction withthe following observations--1.   Tith regard to Item I (a)  of the Agenda (Revision of the     Treaty with regard to the 3eform of the Constitution of the     Governing Body)  the Report of the International Labour Office     does not adduce any evidence which indicates the necessity     for modification of the attitude-set out in the British     roplies to the questionnaire except on the following points.     India has urged that the proposal to provide for the permenent     representation of the six chief states by mentioning them by     name in the Treaty should be replaced by.a general provision     allowing for the election at the Conference of all sixteen     Governments.  The British reply supported the proposal to     mention by name  the United States,  I!ranoe, Germany,  Great     Britain,  Italy and Japan.    This proposal &quot;was adopted in view     of the difficulties which have been experienced under the     Treaty as it stands in defining which are the .8 States of     &quot;Chief industrial importance^.    I do not consider it necessary     to press this point,  but I am still of opinion that permanent     representation should be secured to the States whose position     makes such representation desirable, and that some formula to     secure this and  should be  included in.the new article.    The     draft instructions are drawn accordingly.                                                        /E. On
8.  On Item I (b)  (Periodicity oi the Conference)  most Governments    favour a diminution in the frequency of the Sessions.    The    British reply proposed a revision of the Treaty providing for    a session at least once every two years, but giving to  the    Conference the power to convene a session for any intermediate    year.   The International Labour Office presses strongly,    however, for the  adoption of the other proposal viz.,  to retain    the present text  of the Treaty but in fact to hold large and    small Conferences in alternate years.   I incline to the view    that the Labour group will  favour this proposal and will be    supported by the  weaker Governments.    It has certain a&amp;van-    tages and I should be disposed if necessary to accept  it.   In    any event I attach importance  at the present stage of  the    development of the Organisation to the power which is  secured    by the above formula to convene a Conference in any intermediate    year when there is special urgency.     The draft instructions are    therefore so drawn as to enable the  British Delegates  to adopt    this attitude should occasion  arise. 3.  In the &quot;report on  the second item uQ  the Agenda (Migration    Statistics)  the International  Labour Office have submitted for    consideration by  the Conference a draft Recommendation,  of    which a  copy is annexed hereto.    This draft Recommendation    appears  to form a reasonable basis for discussion and  might be    accepted for that purpose.   Unless, however,  certain  modiii-    indications  of the classifications proposed in the 2nd article    (as indicated in  appendix hereto)  can be carried, it may not be    possible for the  British Delegates to accept the proposals of    tho International labour Office and  I ask for authority to vote    against  them or withhold my vote,  if necessary.

DRABT               Instructions to           Sir Montague Barlow and           Sir David Shackleton,British Government Delegates to the International LabourConference, Geneva, October 18th, 1922 and following days.1.   Item I (a) of the Agenda (Revision of the Treaty ofPeace with a vie?/ to the Reform of the Constitution ofthe Governing Body).     The attitude adopted in the reply of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the Questionnaire circulated by the office should be maintained and the revised text suggested therein&apos;put forward as a basis of discussion in place of that suggested by the International Labour Office.   the delegates need not, however, press for the inclusion inthe new text of a provision which mentions by name the six to eight states who shall have permanent representationprovided that some formula is devised whereby such Statesshall secure permanent representation.2.   Item I (b)  (Periodicity&apos; of the Conference).     The Delegates should endeavour to secure the adoptionof the alternative text suggested in the reply of his majesty&apos;s Government to the Questionnaire but ii there is little likelihood of this text being carried, should not oppose the proposal to retain the present text of theTreaty on the understanding that in fact large and smallConferences would be held, in alternate years.                                                /item
     Item II (Migration Statistics).     The Delegates.should accept the  draft Recommendationsubmitted by the International Labour Office as a basis fordiscussion at the Conference.  If it  is so adopted theyshould propose that it be redrafted generally in more precise language and should in addition put forward thefollowing proposaloj-     (a)   In the first sentence of Article I,  the words           Kas a general rule&quot; should bo inserted on tho           fourth line, next after &quot;three months, and&quot;.           Delete &quot;E&quot; in &quot;Emigrants&quot;  so as to include           emigrants and immigrants when in transit.  In           the last clause of Article I for &quot;full           particulars as to....&quot;read &quot;all available           particulars as to  .....n     (b)   In Article II (3) the age classifications should,           if possible, be modified,  so far as His Majesty&apos;s           Government is concerned, in such a way as to           make It possible for them to suppljr information           on the classifications already adopted by them.           The age limits should, if possible, be indicated           in a general way rather than by precise figures,           since the economic conditions of different           countries are not adequately represented if           uniform limits of age are applied ererywhere.           The requirements as to family conditions           (under (3)) should also be omitted.  The article           cannot be accepted unless the above modifications           for  (2) and (3) are adopted.                                    .               /(c)
(o)    or reasons explained  in His Majesty^ Government&apos;s     replies to the Questionnaire, no  obligation can be     accepted to furnish particulars of  countries of &quot;origin&quot;     or &quot;destination&quot;  unless these terms are defined to mean countries     of immediate last and  immediate future settled  residence     (residence for a  year  or more being treated as  settled     residence).  If more than this is required,  difficult     questions of allegiance and nationality will be involved,     and His Majesty^ Government cannot undertake to furnish     information on these lines.. (d)  Article III should be  omitted for the  reasons set  out in     the replies of His i.iajesty&apos;s Government to tho  Questionnaire,     Alternatively it  should he adopted  as  a separate PLecommenda-     participator. in order that Governments who  are prepared to accept     Articles I and II need not he precluded from voting  for     these Articles,  The British Government Delegates  should     in any event withhold  their vote  unless the Article  is     restricted, to uniform  definition  of &quot;emigrant *&quot;   As  stated     in reply to Questionnaire, His Majesty&apos;s Government  would     be glad to consider the possibility of arriving at a     definition of &quot;emigrant&quot;, but they  cannot accept the.     proposal for a uniform type of identity paper or a. uniform     method of recording information regarding emigrants.  The     Delegates should  also  seek to secure that recourse  to the     International Labour Conference he  made optional,  as the     Dominions are members  of the Organisation and the co-     operation of the  Office is unnecessary in the making of     any agreements to which His Majesty&apos;s  Government are a     party which are directed particularly  to inter-Imperial     migration.
