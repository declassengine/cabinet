[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s tfovernment.]  &quot;                 Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1922.SECRET.CP.  4204.CABINET.CABLE  COMMUNICATION  WITH THE  WEST  INDIES.     Memorandum by the Secretary of State  for the Colonies and  the                            Postmaster-General.    WE circulate  herewith a  report  which has  been  made  to the imperial communications  Committee proposing  the  laying of a new cable from the TurksIslands to Barbados, Trinidad and Demerara in order to put  cable communicationwith the British West Indies on a satisfactory basis.    The present position is dangerous.  The West  India  and Panama Company,which serves the British  islands  other than  Jamaica,  is  in  serious financial difficulties  and may cease  working at  any  moment.  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould then be faced with the possibility, of a recurrence of the scandalous situation that  occurred after the  war  when  cable  communication  was interrupted for months, with disastrous results to commerce.    In any case the contract with the West  India and Panama  Company expiresin 1924, and we are satisfied that it would be impossible to renew it.  Their cablesare worn out.  Their financial  position is  hopeless.  After recent experience, we feel certain that  the Colonies  would not renew their  share of the subsidies  atpresent paid to this Company; and the Company&apos;s engagements  with the CubaSubmarine Company, which are set out in the report, are such as to make itimpossible for any satisfactory  or permanent solution of  the problem to be basedon any arrangement with them.    The report recommends that the General Post Office should pall for  tenders for    (1.)  Making and laying a new cable from Turks Islands to Barbados.    (2.)  Making and laying spurs from Barbados to  Trinidad and British Guiana.    (3.)  Making and erecting a central wireless telegraph station at Barbados and          stations  in  each  of   the Windward and  Leeward Islands,   except          Montserrat.    The annual cost of this scheme,  spread over a period  of  forty years,  is approximately estimated at  11,700,  as  against  the total subsidy of  26,300 nowpaid by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government,  Canada and the West Indies to  the  WestIndia and Panama Company.    It is proposed that the Pacific Cable Board should undertake the management of the new cable and wireless system  as the agent  of the Government concerned,if the Company is found willing to  do so.  In that case it  would - probably  benecessary that the cost should be met by  a guarantee of expenditure rather thanby a fixed subsidy.    We strongly recommend this scheme as  the only satisfactory solution of amost unsatisfactory and even dangerous situation, and we  would  suggest that itshould be approved in principle and the  Departments concerned, viz., the Treasury,the General Post Office and the Colonial  Office should be  authorised to settle alldetails.                                                      (Signed)    W.  S. C.                                                                  P. G. K.    September 21, 1922.[8904]
SECRET.(I.C.C. No. 659.)COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.IMPERIAL  COMMUNICATIONS   COMMITTEE.SITUATION IN REGARD  TO CABLE COMMUNICATIONS IN THE WEST INDIES.                   (Previous LC.C. Paper No. 284.)           Report of the West Indies Communications Sub-Committee.     OUR first report on cable communication with the West  Indies was made in June 1920.  In it we recommended the laying of a new cable  from  Bermuda to Barbados, Trinidad and Demerara, or, as an alternative, from  Bermuda to Barbados and British  Guiana, leaving&quot;  Trinidad  to be served by the existing cable from Barbados through St. Vincent and Grenada.  It was clear that the subsidies now being  paid to the West India and Panama Company would not be available for the  new cable until  the contract with  the  Panama  Company expired on  the 30th September, 1924.  But we suggested  that negotiations should be begun at once on the basis that the  new cable should  be laid as soon as practicable,  but that the period for which they should run should be deferred until the Panama Company&apos;s agreement expired.   Enquiries and negotiations were  begun by  the General Post Office and certain tentative figures were obtained.     2. As prices were falling, time was obviously  on the side of the Government, and  it was not considered desirable to press forward the negotiations so long as there was a prospect of obtaining better offers by waiting.  This policy has, in fact, been justified by  a fall in the price of cable, and by certain indications that  there might be some competition  with the group to which negotiations were in the first instance limited, and by the very favourable offer which has been recently made.     3. Further delay has been  caused by the  necessity of referring to the Law Officers certain legal questions which arose on the examination of our first report. In order to explain  these questions it will  be necessary briefly to summarize  the proposals which we made in our first report for dealing with the West India and Panama Company&apos;s cable system.     4.  The West India and  Panama Company is bound by  a perpetual working agreement with the Cuba Submarine Company either to  send messages over the Cuba Company&apos;s cable or to  pay to that Company the sum it would have received if the message had  been so sent.  We were satisfied that this  agreement would prevent the Panama Company from any effective co-operation in the proposed new cable, and we anticipated that  the admitted  financial difficulties  of the  Company would  be brought to a head by the laying of the new cable.  We also  understood that it would be impossible for the Government in  the  circumstances to acquire either from the Panama Company or from its  liquidator any portion of its  cable system by way of  agreement.  But we felt it to be an advantage / that so much  of that system as connected the West Indian end of the new cable with the smallerWest Indian Islands should  be acquired and worked in conjunction with the new cable.   It was impossible to leave the Windward  and Leeward Islands without telegraphic communication, and there  were  objections to relying  on  wireless telegraphy.  We therefore recommended that  if the possible contingency arose ofthe cessation of work by the cables in question the  Governments  concerned should take over so much as was required of the Panama Company&apos;s system in conditions* I.C.O. Paper No. 284.
which would have eliminated the agreement with the Cuba Submarine Company,and arrange for it to be worked in conjunction with the new cable.    5. The  Imperial  Communications  Committee  generally  approved  theseproposals.    6. In November 1921 the West  India and Panama Company  represented tothe Treasury that their financial position was such that they could not continueworking without a special grant or an  increased subsidy.  We reported on their letter, and the immediate difficulty was adjusted.  In the course of our enquiry into the matter it was suggested to us that it might be possible for a liquidator tosell to the Government part of the Panama Company&apos;s system without transferring the obligations of  their agreement with the Cuba  Submarine Company.  If thisview were correct, the  proposals in  our first report clearly required modification.In our report of December 1921 we  therefore recommended  reference to the LawOfficers on the  subject.  Our December report has not  been  before the imperial communications Committee, but, to save time,  the  Colonial Office referred thequestion to the Law Officers.   Their report has  now been received.  It confirms,the view we originally took.  The position therefore is that the Panama Companycannot transfer to the Government any part of their cable system without eithertransferring the obligations of their agreement with the Cuba Submarine company or obtaining that Company&apos;s consent to the transfer on  other  terms.  The latteralternative has little to  recommend  it to  the Cuba Company,  and is  thereforehardly a practical contingency at present.    7. The agreement with the Panama Company does not expire until September1924,  but the Company have intimated to the Treasury that they are not earningtheir  debenture interest, and that  the directors are advised  to  call their  share-holders together with  a view to going into  liquidation.   If  this  course  is taken,cable  communication may cease a,ny day without much notice.  The matter has there fore become very urgent.   We  understand that  emergency measures to dealwith this contingency have been prepared  by the Colonial Office.    8. The  laying of a new cable is essential if  telegraphic  communication withthe West Indies is  to be maintained.   The main line portion of the PanamaCompany&apos;s cable is the oldest part of their  system and  subject to frequent inter-ruptions.  It cannot last much longer without renewal, and it is especially liableto be  broken by earthquakes.  Moreover, it passes through foreign territory and istherefore subject to foreign control of messages.  Again, in view of  the experienceof the last few years, it is at least  doubtful  whether the colonies  concerned wouldbe willing to renew their subsidies to the West India and Panama Company.  Inour opinion it would be unwise of them to do so.  Cable communication with theWest Indies will never be satisfactory so long as one of the links in the chain is aworn-out cable owned by a company in an admittedly weak financial position thatis involved in hampering covenants from which it cannot escape.  Whatever mayhave  been the  case in 1914. subsequent experience has shown that the policy ofbolstering up the Panama Company is unsound and must  be  abandoned.  Wetherefore postulate as an essential condition of the maintenance of cable communi-cation with  the West  Indian Colonies the laying  of  a new cable which will nottouch foreign territory and will be free from any obligation to the Cuba SubmarineCompany.    9, We a,re satisfied that high power wireless telegraphy would not be a suitablesubstitute for a new main  cable.   This question was  more fully discussed in our first report.   Briefly,  the objections are  that wireless  telegraphy has not yetovercome the difficulties due to &quot;atmospherics &quot;  which are particularly bad in the carribbean.   Wireless communication  for  commercial  purposes in time  of  war would be less  satisfactory as  being  liable to restriction  and possibly  entireprohibition.  During the war the Admiralty would not allow messages relating tomovements  of  shipping  to be sent by it, and such messages  are essential to theeconomic existence of the colonies concerned.  Cypher communication by wirelessfor ordinary Government purposes could not be allowed at any time.    10. When our first report was made we had expert  advice that  the route fromBermuda would give a better bed for the cable than one along the islands.  Wehave since received further expert advice that it would  not  be practicable to use this route without a marine survey and we learn from the Admiralty that no ship      [8748]  [8904]                                                B 2
will be available for such a survey before 1923.   The  expense might be  consider-able and  there are no funds to meet it.  The question of time is most important in present conditions.  The laying of the Miami-Barbados cable  has shown thatthe route  along the  islands is practicable.   The  distance between Turks  Island,where the existing Bermuda-Jamaica cable has an intermediate station, is  shorterand therefore cheaper than that between Bermuda  and Barbados ; and  we are advised by the Telegraph  Construction  and Maintenance Company&apos;s experts thatin their opinion it is preferable.    11. On these grounds we think that  the proposed new cable should  be  laidfrom the  Turks  Islands, where it will  connect with  the cable from Bermuda toJamaica, to Barbados and  with spurs from Barbados  to  Trinidad and  british guiana.    12. In the absence of definite approval of our scheme it has not been possibleto call for tenders, but informal  negotiations have been  carried on by the general post Office.   In November 1921, the interests controlling the Bermuda companies were prepared to consider laying a Bermuda-Barbados-Trinidad-Demerara cableon terms which would have  imposed on the Government a net liability of  30,000a year for twenty-five years or   35,000  for twenty years,  with certain reservationsas regards the cost of maintenance depending on the question whether a cable ship was found to be necessary.  This was a  considerable reduction on an earlierproposal.  Quite recently the same  interests have stated informally that they areprepared to lay, maintain and work the cable in return for a subsidy of  30,000 ayear for twenty-five years.    13. A few  weeks ago the  General Post Office received  from the  managing director of the Telegraph Construction  and  Maintenance Company the  followingestimates : The Company would have no objection to receiving payment in equal instalmentsextending over a number of years on a 5 per cent, basis.   If the period were twenty years, this would mean instalments of  about  27,100 a year.   If the period wasforty years, which is the estimated life of a cable, the figure would be  19,700.     14. The cost of operating the cables would  probably be about  12,000 a year,and the  cost  of  maintenance  would not, it is believed, exceed  15,000 on  anaverage during forty  years.   Thus the total expenses of the  scheme would  beabout  46,700, or, say, allowing  for contingencies,   50,000 a year. We propose totake the present value of the traffic to and from Barbados, Trinidad and Demeraraat about   42,000, though this is a conservative figure, and an appreciable increaseof traffic is probable  through  the  arrangements made by the Trinidad wireless station for taking Venezuela traffic, and there is also the possibility of tapping acertain amount of traffic between Canada and South America.  The only difficulty is that of providing expert management and staff.  This would be overcome if the pacific Cable Board would work the cable.     -LU. we leuuiuiiiBuu tutsreiuie LiitMj UIJ.6 vjrtuitsraij. xruSu V-ymut; Siiuuiu uS auuLiOnSeuto arrange for the laying of  new cables from  Turks Island to  Barbados and fromBarbados to Trinidad and Demerara;  and that the Pacific Cable  Board  should  beasked to undertake the working of these cables as a system, when  laid, if, as wefear is likely, no company offers to undertake  the work on reasonable terms.     16. The problem  of  communication between  Trinidad or Barbados  and thesmaller islands is more difficult.  It is obvious  that for administrative,  economicand political reasons these islands cannot be left without telegraphic communica-tion.  We need  not  labour this point.   The  only  question is what  form the communication should take.     17. In view of the age  of the existing cables, and the complications due  tothe agreement with the Cuba  Submarine Company, the ideal  course would  be  toCable, Turks to Barbados ....Cable, Barbados to DemeraraCable, Barbados to TrinidadLaying  ....   154,000 80,000 47,000 45,000 326,000
lay new cables connecting each British island with its  neighbour and  ultimatelywith Trinidad. *  If this course were adopted, the standing charges for interest and.amortisation (on a forty-year basis) would probably amount to about  9,000 a year,and the cost of  operating to another  12,000 a year.   The cost of maintenance is uncertain, but might be put at  10,000 a year if it were possible to do without acable ship, but this is doubtful.   The cost of a ship would probably be  30,000 perannum, but  it  would also be available  for  both  portions of the  system.   Thiswould reduce our estimate for the maintenance of  the main portion of the cable,and the total cost of maintenance of both portions might in that case be put  at 35,000,  instead of  55,000,  if  the two portions of the  scheme  are  considered separately.   This  would  make  the  total annual liability of the Governmentsconcerned  for cable communication with  the West  Indies  87,700, or, in roundfigures,  90,000 a year, against which thei-e would be an estimated revenue of some 50,000 a year.   The total of the existing subsidies to the West India and PanamaCompany provided under the agreement of  1919  is  26,300 a year, of which  8,000a year is contributed by His Majesty&apos;s Government,   8,000 by the  canadian government and  10,300 by the West Indian Colonies.    18.  Although this solution would be the ideal one, we anticipate  that  therewould be considerable criticism  of a proposal to lay new cables to each  smallisland both on the ground of expense and  as being wasteful while cables betweenthem are already in existence. On this ground we  proceed to examine two possible alternatives.    19.  The existing cables  are  old, but, with certain modifications  which  could probably be carried out without much expense,  they  might be relied on to provideeommunication with the smaller islands for some years to come.t  The plant valueof these cables south of Antigua and St. Kitts may perhaps be put at somethingunder  50,000;  and if they  could  be bought, and  the necessary modificationseffected, for that sum, not only  would the  capital  cost of the  new  inter-islandcables referred  to in paragraph  18 be  saved, but the proposed new cable fromBarbados to Trinidad mentioned  in paragraph 14 might be dispensed with, with afurther capital saving of about  55,000 (including laying).  The saving in standingcharges would not of course  be  proportionate, because  the cost  of the  acquiredcables would have to be recouped in their lifetime, which could not be put at morethan ten years.  But even allowing for this, the  saving in standing charges on thewhole scheme, as set forth in paragraph 18, could hardly be less than  6,000.  (Inthe appendix the difference between  schemes I and  II is worked out in full on adifferent basis.)   Thus, the  other annual costs  remaining the same, the total annual liability of the Governments (on the assumption that a cable ship wouldbe necessary) would be reduced to  84,000 against an estimated  initial revenue of 50,000.    The  total capital  expenditure  under  this  scheme  might  be put  asfollows : Of this amount the  first item, as already  mentioned, could, if  desired, be paid ininstalments.    It should  be remembered  that under  this scheme the renewal of the cablesafter  ten  years would involve a further expenditure of   150,000 and additionalrecurrent  charges of   3,500 per annum on a forty year basis.    20. We think, on the whole, that the  acquisition of this  part  of the PanamaCompany&apos;s  system (viz., the cables required to link up  the small islands withBarbados), would be the most business-like course, in that use is made of existingcables.  Unfortunately, the Law  Officers  have advised the  Colonial Office that neither the  Panama  Company nor its  liquidator could transfer these cables  to theGovernment without either obtaining  the consent of the Cuba Submarine company or making arrangements as beneficial  to that Company as its existing agreementNew cables (including laying)Old cables (estimated purchase price)Cable shipContingencies   271,000 50,000 75,000 14,000 410,000* See Appendix, Scheme I.f See Appendix, Scheme II.
with the Panama Company.  Either course appears impracticable.  So long as thePanama Company exists, there is no inducement to the Cuba Submarine company to submit to a transfer which would deprive them of their whole revenue.   It is,on the other hand, impossible to contemplate the Government  perpetuating  theintolerable restrictions imposed by the existing agreement.     We originally thought that  it might be possible to expropriate the  cables bylocal action.  The Law Officers have  advised  that this is beyond the power ofthe  Colonies, and  would require an  Imperial Act.   Imperial legislation, in ouropinion, provides the most straightforward solution.  Apart from such legislation,it seems to us that the way to acquire these cables is  to wait until the financial difficulties  of the West India and Panama Company render their operationsimpossible, which is an imminent contingency.  When the  Company  ceases  towork,  the Governments of the Colonies would, under powers  conferred by  the^ordinances in virtue of which the Panama Company&apos;s  system was laid, takepossession of the  shore  ends of the cables and work them  provisionally.  Thisemergency occupation cannot be turned into a permanent measure, as  the ColonialLegislatures  have no power to legislate with  regard to the cables in so far as theyare laid under the high seas. But if His Majesty&apos;s Government have by then made arrangements for the laying of the  new cable, and if the Colonial  Governments arein lawful  possession of the shore ends of the Panama  Company&apos;s  inter-islandcables,  the Government will be in a very strong  position for negotiating with  theCuba Submarine  Company as well as with  the Panama  Company.  It appearsunder the Colonial Ordinances  that the company cannot transfer its  undertakingwithout the consent of the Colonial Legislatures.  The Panama Company&apos;s cablesto the American islands can be  left to the liquidator to dispose of as he thinks fit.As already mentioned, we put the  outside  limit of any compensation to the two companies at  50,000, which would also cover  the  cost of certain  modifications(e.g., the cutting of the cables  out of the foreign  territory  on which  they nowtouch).     21. An alternative method  of  providing for the needs of the smaller islands would be by wireless telegraphy.&apos;::;  The objections to the use of wireless telegraphymentioned in paragraph  10 as applying to the main portion of the scheme would,of course, apply also in  some measure to this  portion of  it; but, in view of thesmallness  of  the traffic  and the comparative unimportance of the islands from acommercial point of view, these  objections would not involve risk of loss  on nearly so large a scale.   Moreover, the  distances to be covered being comparatively small,the atmospheric difficulties would be much  less.  We are informed that  the total capital  cost of a central  station at Barbados,  with corresponding stations at eachof the  six islands concerned, would  be less  than  25,000 ; and that the annualexpenses, including  standing charges, maintenance  and cost  of  operation, wouldnot be more  than   15,000.   Adding these expenses to those  mentioned in  para-graph 15, we should have an annual average expenditure of about  61,700 against an estimated  revenue of   50,000.     22. A possible modification  of  the scheme would be the adoption of wireless telegraphy between Trinidad and Demei-ara instead of a cable between  Barbadosand  Demerara with a resulting saving of   92,000  in initial charges and  some 10,000  in  recurrent  charges.t    We  have, however,  already  pointed out theobjections to  the use  of wireless  telegraphy  for communication with importantcentres, and having regard to the traffic  available in British Guiana  and the factthat until recently  cable communication with  the colony existed, and that thepresent substitute does not give complete  satisfaction, we are inclined to doubt whether this modification would be satisfactory.     In  the event  of laying a cable the full contribution  from  British  Guiana( 3,000) which has been reduced during the  interruption of  the cable  would, ofcourse,  revive.     23. In view of the  expense involved by the adoption of  the cable systemthroughout, we recommend that only the main cables  mentioned in paragraph 13should  be  laid  and  that  communication  with the  smaller  islands should bemaintained by wireless telegraphy.  In that  case if the arrangement for payment by instalments should be adopted, the estimated capital expenditure to  be incurredimmediately  would be limited  to  the cost  of the wireless telegraphy stations-L* See Appendix, Scheme III.t See Appendix, Scheme IV.
say  25,000 together with a moderate sum for  contingencies say  10,000 or 35,000 in all.    24. We annex an appendix showing in tabular form the estimated cost of thevarious schemes mentioned.  For comparative purposes, these figures may be takento represent  the  relative cost of  the  different  proposals; but  it must  beremembered that they are only estimates.    25. We desire also to make it clear that, should any of  the courses involving an increase in the subsidy be adopted, the subsidy from His  Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould, in our opinion, only be increased on condition that  the other contributingGovernments make an equivalent and  proportionate increase  in their respectivecontributions.    26. To sum up, we recommend that, as a first step to carrying out our scheme,the General Post Office should be authorised to call for tenders showing separatelythe cost of each of the following services:     (I.) Making and laying a new cable from Turks Island to Barbados;    (2.) Making and laying spurs from (a) Barbados to Trinidad and (5) Barbados          to British  Guiana;    (3.) Making and  erecting a Central  Wireless Telegraph Station  at Barbados          and of  stations in  each of the Windward  and Leeward Islands, with          the exception of Montserrat.    The result of the tenders could then be  discussed by the three Departmentsconcerned before a final decision was taken.    We also recommend that if no Company is found willing to  undertake theworking of the cable, the Pacific Cable Board should be  consulted as to the termson which they woiild undertake to work the  main line  cables in any case, and, if required,  the wireless telegraphy to the smaller islands.
