(THIS DOOgMgHT  IS THE PROPERTY  OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMBHT) .(RET .                                                                   &quot;IP. 4255.                           OA  B I NET.                         ^            REPORT OF  OOMMITTBB PIT  GROWN AND  GOVERNMENT LAITDS *             Memorandum by the First  OOnmriss practitioner  of  Worfcs;            The officers of my Department, in giving  evidence  before the Committee, expressed the view that concentration of  the surveying and valuation  work  for Government  purposes  in the  Office of Works would probably result in increased  efficiency  and a considerable saving in the  numbers and cost of staff.  I concur&apos; in  that opinion, though  I  personally am not anxious to  have these duties added; but I am very far  from  believing that  the method put forward by tho Committee will ensure the fullest  benefits to  be expected  from such concentrations            The proposed new Central  Lands Department could, noI  doubt, effect sales  of redundant  property as well as myI  Department,  and might be no  less  effective  in the matter  ofi  purchases: but the number of these  transactions  on  behalf of the  Office of Works is likely to be very small  Indeed for many years  to come.  If, however, it becomes necessary to utilise  the  services of  the Central  Lands Department to effect  hirings, some  4,000 of which are held  by my Department, administrative  difficulties will be greatly increased and  Introduce further.  delays and exjjen.se,  negotiations for hirings (in respect of which  valuations are seldom, If ever, necessary)  must, I  submit, be  rego,rded as  duties unsuitable for Incorporation  In  the  Central  Lands Department, as must also such responsibility  of management  as falls upon my Department  in Its  capacity of lessee or  tenant.                                                             It
It is with these duties that the officers of the Hire and purchase Branch of my Directorate of Lands are almost whollyconcerned and, if my view be accepted, they will not beavailable for transfer to the Central Lands Department.          With regard to the housing estates now administered by my Department, I can only asnume that, as the Central LandsDepartment is to be an Agency Department, the responsibilityfor the Vote from which outgoings are defrayed and in aid ofwhich rents are appropriated&apos;will still rest with me,, in spiteof the fact that&apos;the managing staff will not be under mycontrol.  In any case, maintenance should clearly be left with my Department, and- the Central Lands Department should not beallowed - to set up a building staff of its own.  Such duplicationwould be inadvisable, and it would be necessary for suchmaintenance work as. is now carried out by the Office - of Woodsto be transferred to my Department, and not to the Central Lands&apos;Department. . This increased obligation I should deprecate.          In short, as the new arrangements would, lead to difficulties of administration which require carefulconsideration in detail, I agree with the proposal made bythe Secretary of State for War, in his memorandum (CP. 4130)of the 24th July,  1922, that a Cabinet Committee of all theMinisters concerned should consider the Report.                          .
