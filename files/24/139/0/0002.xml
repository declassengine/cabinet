[This Document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required lor official use.]^33 L ^r^^5s 0.fc* 4 20 2  Je,,,feHALLFRANCE,.Telephone Message from Lord cureon&apos; to cabinet and             Prime Minister..       Received  8,0.p.m..   September 20th. 1922.      This afternoon I saw Sforza before the meeting and explained the  situation to him adding that Ishould welcome his presence to hear Admiral Beattyand to take part in subsequent discussion.  Heattended and was helpful rather than otherwise.Meeting began with attempt on my part to elucidatethe position taken up by Poincare this morning withregard to southern shore of both Straits.  I askedwhether French government in issuing recent orders to withdraw all French troops from Asiatic side ofboth Straits meant to repudiate any allied obliga-tion on Asiatic coast and whether they regarded itas a loyal proceeding to take such action in sup-pression of orders of their own commanders withoutany notice to their allies, leaving the latter tobear the sole brunt of Kemalist attack and theodium, if retreat  were necessary, of that retirement.      M. Poincare*  exhibited extreme irritation atrevival of this question in so embarrassing a formand had no reply except that action of French g.c.m.g.-manders had not boen authorised by him, that he hadpersonally countermanded it, that the sovereignauthority of the French government and FrenchParliement involved, and that French public opinion would not tolerate the death of a single Frenchsoldier at the hands of a Turk or of a single Turkat the hands of a  Frenchman.  I said that thisanswer
answer cleared the air, because it meant that theFrench were at liberty to tear up the alliance assoon as a French life was imperilled.  If this wasto be the rule on one shore of the Straits it couldequally apply on the other end I should not hesitate to report to my government this novel interpretation of allied duty and to claim for them an equal degreeof independence at Gallipoli and at Constantinople.I asked M. Poincare whether, he had measured the fullmeaning of this extraordinary declaration and whatwould have been the feelings had we for fear ofendangering British lives returned a similar response to French appeals for support at Chatalja or else-where.  Nor could he relish the position of compel -ling an allied force to retreat because he was afraid of imperilling a single French life.  This argument,though provocative at the moment of a rather livelyscene, had, as will be seen, an extraordinary effect upon M. Poincare&apos;o attitude later on, more particular-ly when at a subsequent stage, discussing theresponsibility for sole action that had just beenthrust upon us, I said that we were quite prepared toact upon it and that though I had come to Paris to urge allied action, now that the French had openlydisavov/ed this I was perfectly prepared to recommendsingle action and that my government would not, inrespect of the Dardanelles, hesitate to act alone  ifcompelled to do  so.  We do not want to act aloneI said: but we have the power to do so and if  com-pelled we will.  Effect of this was seen later on.                                         Lord
      Lord. Beatty -then came in and gave an exceedinglyconcise and impressive account of the power of theBritish navy (a) to prevent the Turkish seizure and armament of Chanak position, (b) to keep the Straitsopen, (c) to hold the Gallipoll Peninsula against allattack, (d) to prevent the invasion of Thrace  acrossthe Marmora, (e) to prevent the capture of Constanti-nople on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorua..      M. Poincare had with commendable astutenessmobilised the French Admiral Grasset to counter allthese propositions, which he did with great amiabilityand lack of success,  I then utilized Grasset1s argu-ment as to the  ease with which the Turks would occupyeither position and threaten Europe, to emphasizethe folly of abandoning the Asiatic shore and  concedingto Kemal this gratuitous advantage.       The Admiral having retired I then initiated thediscussion on desirability of early peace conference,and without committing myself before hearing Frenchand Italian views, recommended the immediate summoning of such a conference to include Great Powers,  greece and Turkey, Serbia and Boumania, to sit whereverFrance and Italy desired and to not proceed with and preliminary conversations but with drawing up  of anew peacea      Both Poincare&apos; and Sforza agreed to summon such  aconference at once, to hold it at Venice or some otheragreed spot, to have no preliminary discussions and to admit the above Balkan states,  But they urged thatour conversations should be extended so as to  arriveif possible at  a preliminary understanding between                                        ourselves
ourselves concerning the &quot;bases on which such a con-ference could profitably he held,  I said that i could not enter upon any euch conversations withoutauthority of my government and that I must refer tothem &quot;before proceeding further.  I will indicate in another telegram the lines upon which I desireto proceed.  The extreme amiability with whichPoincare had accepted these proposals encouraged meto make a final appeal to him.  Keverting to theterrible responsibility which he had assumed byhis attitude as regards the Straits, I said that itwas incumbent upon him to use his influence withKemal which I knew to be supreme, to desist fromany action which might imperil the success or eventhe meeting of the conference thus accepted inprinciple, and might compel Great Britain to act alone.  Poincare* at once accepted this responsi-bility and appeared to be confident as to its success.      In my own mind I entertain little doubt thathe will now stop Kemal from any precipitate or fool-hardy advance and  that our strong policy will thus have been justified.  I can hardly exaggerate dlf-ference between his attitude  at beginning and  endof sitting and begin to think we may  emerge from this very difficult position with  success.  Per the momentI would urge that  while maintaining our position wedesist from any action likely to provoke immediatehostilities.
