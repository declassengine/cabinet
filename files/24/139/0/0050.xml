This document is the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s G-overnment.SECRET.CP.  4250.THE CABINET.REPORT  ON THE  SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE WEEK                    ENDING 23rd  SEPTEMBER, 1922.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  WAR.     I circulate the report on  the Irish situation by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 23rd September, 1922.                                                                        L.  W.-E.  THE WAR OFFICE,       2nd October, 1922.                                SOUTHERN IRELAND.     (a)  Dublin. There has been no change in the military situation  in the Dubkn area during  the  past  week.  An ambush,  attended  with more  than the  usual number  of casulties, took place near 0&apos;Connell Bridge, in the centre of the city, on 22nd September.A lorry of Provisional  Government troops was attacked  with bombs and revolver fire  inthis crowded  thoroughfare.  Three  of the soldiers  were killed  or wounded  and.  fourpassers by were also wounded.  On 23rd September,  on the outskirts of Dubliu an attack was made on a touring  car in which  General  0&apos;Duffy, Chief Commissioner  of  the CivicGuard,  and Commandant  General  Hogan were  travelling.  The occupants of the cat-escaped unhurt.   There are daily  robberies by armed  men both  in the town and suburbsand on one occasion 400 trench coats were taken from a store.     The Southern Irish postal  strike continues.   The  authorities have got a modifiedservice working now, and, according  to their official  reports in the newspapers they arehandling a gradually increasing number of letters and telegrams  in the city area,  whilstmilitary escorts are provided once or twice in the week to  convey  postal matter to andfrom  country centres.  The strikers have retaliated  by  repeated interference  with the telegraph and  telephone lines running out of Dublin and with those which connect  withthe cables to England.     There have been no attacks on British troops during the week.     (b)  Outside  Dublin. It cannot be said that the  situation in the country districtshas  improved.   Operations on  a  comparatively large scale  have   been   carried  outin Counties  Sligo  and North Mayo by the  Provisional Government troops ;  but it  wouldappear that little permanent result is  effected as the Republicans merely disappear into the hills whenever they find that their opponents are cornering them.   The fact is that theProvisional Government, having scattered their available forces in small garrisons all  overthe 26 counties, dare not concentrate sufficient men in  any one area for  &quot; drives &quot; (suchas were carried out by the British troops in 1921) in  which the chances of escape of  evenindividuals would be small.     There was, however,  one successful  incident in the Sligo fighting in which  nineRepublicans were  killed including S.  Devins, a member of the Dail, and Brian  McNeill,son of the present Minister of Education.   In  the North Mayo operations the ProvisionalGovernment claim that they destroyed the Rolls Royce  armoured car &quot; Ballinalee &quot; whichhad been twice captured by the Republicans.     There is little news  from County  Cork.   No railways  are  running in  this countysouth of Buttevant owing to the destruction of so many bridges.   The military situationin Cork city appears to  be  the same as in Dublin.     The British soldiers stationed in the Queenstown forts  do not go up to Cork ;  butthey can freely move about in Queenstown and neighbourhood.     Information as to the state of affairs in Co. Kerry is obtained mainly  from british naval sources.   A report of the S.N.O.  Haulbowline dated 19th September and  addressedto the Admiralty can be summarized  as follows : -     There are Provisional Government garrisons at Tralee, Waterville  (100 armed men),Cahirciveen  (65 men)  and Valentia (25  men).   Commandant Griffin, in command  at    (B22/253)  100 10/22 W.O.P. 383
Waterville,  is  an energetic man  and appears to  be sound.   He  considers that the republicans (or &quot;Die-hards,&quot;  as  they  are  now  generally  called by the  ProvisionalGovernment troops) are  short  of arms and will continue to raid small posts for them.In  Kerry there  are plenty of Thompson machine guns, but,  before the capture of theKenmare garrison, very little ammunition for these guns.  He stated that the Kenmareaffair was  simply a  case  of treachery,  about  30  men  having  joined the  ProvisionalGovernment garrison  for  the  purpose.   General  0&apos;Connor  and  his  brother weremurdered because they  were the  only men  of the garrison  who were not  corruptible.Griffin considered the  situation at Cahirciveen to be dangerous, and he  frankly admitted that, without the assistance of the searchlights of  His Majesty&apos;s ships at Valentia, therewould be little chance of  holding the place.   On the  night of 18th/19th  September,H.M. Ship &quot; Waterhen &quot; fired a star shell which effectively stopped a battle which was inprogress     A   wireless message   from  S.N.O.,  Haulbowline,  states  that,  at  2 a.m.,  on24th September, Cahirciveen was again, attacked by Republicans, and  that His Majesty&apos;sship on the station  helped  with her  searchlights  and lent the Provisional Governmentgarrison two Lewis guns and 2,000 rounds of ammunition.  There would appear to be1,200 armed Republicans in Co. Kerry, and the Commandent  Griffin, referred to  above,considers that  if Dublin does  not send  large reinforcements very soon, the  ProvisionalGovernment garrisons will  be swept  away and  the whole county will follow the line ofleast resistance.     No  railways are working in the county.     Since  the  Castletown  (Co. Kerry) affair, when some British officers were attackedwhilst drawing pay money from the local bank, the British garrison  at Bere Island hasnot landed on the mainland.     Up  in  (Jo. Donegal the British, soldiers of the Lough Swilly defences are on friendlyterms with the local inhabitants and Provisional Government troops.     &quot; Practice  seawards &quot; has been carried out  successfully by all types of guns  of thecoast defences a,t Queenstown, Bere and Lough Swilly.     According to the  Republican propaganda sheet &quot; Poblacht na h-Eireann,&quot; which isstill published and sold almost daily in the streets of Dublin, the Republicans claim tohave  captured   about  2,000  rifles from  the  Provisional  Government troops between28th June and 22nd September of  this j^ear.  The attached table gives the proportion ofcaptures  by provinces.  Included in these claims  were  100  rifles captured  in Dundalk,but it is  known that the Provisional Government  troops  have recaptured a fair numberof these.     The military authorities of the Provisional Government have now started  a fully equipped hospital train, and the first wounded  to  be carried  by this train were brought from Limerick  to Dublin a few days ago.     Doctor Cohalan, Bishop of Cork, has issued along, clear and very outspoken pastoral tothe clergy and  laity of his  diocese.   This pastoral is reported almost  in full in the IrishTimes  and   other  Dublin  papers of  25th September.   The  Bishop condemns the republican doctrine that what a man&apos;s conscience assures him to be lawful, that is lawful  ;in other  words, that the Republicans  push the doctrine of subjectivism  too far.   DoctorCohalan  points out that the Irish Roman Catholic bishops have collectively denounced triekilling of Provisional Government  soldiers (z.e., the representatives of the  lawful civilauthority of  the country as elected by the majority of the people), as murder, the seizure of public and private goods as robbery, and. the destruction of property as immoral.  the bishop warns the youth of  his diocese against  being led astray by the  false  teaching ofpolitical  leaders  into  thinking  that  they do no wrong  in  taking  up arms  against theProvisional Government.     He  considers that the  present  troubles  in  Ireland are due, in no small  part, to the  Republican Oath &quot; which was  imposed on the  deputies of  the  Dail  and on the IrishVolunteers in 1919.   He denounces  this oath as  invalid and unlawful morally ;  and  hedeplores  the fact that this oath  is being administered to members of the Fianna (IrishBoy Scouts), who are still attending school.     If others are as outspoken as Doctor Cohalan, such clearly-worded denunciationsmay have some effect on the country, when the wintry weather begins to cool  the  martialardour of the young Republicans in the hills of  Southern Ireland.                                 NORTHERN  IRELAND.     The wreek  ending 19th  September was  notable for a pronounced increase in acts of violence  in  Belfast, which threatens once  more to  develop into the series of reprisals and counter-reprisals with which the city is so familiar.

The capture of 200,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition is also claimed.     As far as can  be ascertained the responsibility for 28 out of the  30 casualties rests with the Protestants.  There is reason to  believe that the  majority of the outrages arethe work of a small party of extremists, with  whom no  one is in  sympathy.   Thethrowing of the bomb on 15th instant, which killed 2 and wounded 7 Catholics, and the deliberate murder of a Catholic woman, whose husband is away at sea, were particularlybrutal  incidents.   The motive for this latest campaign is probably to be  found in thefact that only during times of  uproar can a certain low type of hooligan find a living bylooting and  robbery ; also in the fact  that certain of the &quot; C &quot; class  of constabulary arevery discontented  at their  disbandment,  and seek  re-employment  by creating freshdisturbances.     To date there has been no planned reprisal  by the Irish Republican Army.  It is unlikely, however, that the attacks  on the  Catholics will be taken  lying down much longer, and action  by the Irish Republican Army may bring into the field loyalists who,at present, have no sympathy with these attacks.     No events of importance have occurred outside Belfast in the Six Counties.     The reduction, not only of the  Special  Constabulary and the  British Army along the border, but also of the Provisional Government  forces  on the far side, who have  beensent  as reinforcements  to the south and west, has  left the  field more  free for action bythe Republicans, and in places the border inhabitants are becoming apprehensive.     The headquarters of the  Irish Wing, R.A.F.,  moved  by road on 20th Septemberfrom Dublin to Templepatrick, Co. Antrim.     At the last moment, owing to the situation in the Near East, the moves of the lasttwo of the seven  battalions detailed to leave  Northern  Ireland were  cancelled, and the2nd Green Howards and  the 2nd Bn. Hampshire  Regiment had to remain behind.  The2nd  Bn. Royal Fusiliers and the 2nd  Bn. Rifle Brigade  have been moved  from  belfast and Strabane to England, preparatory to going on foreign service, and the 2nd Bn. GreenHowards from  Aldergrove (Co. Antrim) have taken the place of the Royal Fusiliers in belfast.                                    J. BRIND, Colonel,                                           For  Major- General,                                                    Commanding-in-Chief, Ireland.   General Headquarters,         Dublin,             26th  September, 1922.
