British Commonwealth Union,                                            24, Abingdon Street,                                              Westminster,LOS DOM, S.W.I.                                               10th October j, 1922.Lear Prime Minister,,                              ,          The multitude of conflicting reports relating to  theindustrial and financial conditions of Germany which reached thiscountry during the past couple of years made it extremely difficulton the. part of our manufacturers and the commercial community to formany reliable judgment of the real situation.          This Unicn, therefore, decided to send a Deputation to investigate the actual facts and Sir Philip Dawson, M.AP., andMr., P. J. Hannon, MAP,, were appointed to undertake an exhaustiveprocess of enquiry.         Through introductions which were arranged by financialand industrial British firms which have had trading associations withGermany, the two representatives of this Union were enabled to studyevery phase of German public life and were accorded every facility  toexamine the social and economic problems with which Germany is nowconfronted.   They were received by the President of the german republic, met most of the German Ministers and Permanent Heads of departments, the leading bankers, manufacturers, shipping and commercialmen as well as the leaders of the various Labour Organisations.They also investigated the conditions of the various municipalitiesthey visited and received from the Burgomssters and city officialsfull reports on the state of municipal finance, public health,education, housing and social welfare.         A very full report of the results of this enquiry is being prepared, but I think it will be fitting that you should be made aware of certain facts which came to the knowledge of Sir rhilip  Dawson andMr. Hannon and which they and I feel deserve the careful considerationof the government.    These facts are :-     (1)   Secret communications have been for a           considerable time taking place between French           and German leaders of industry and finance with           the object of bringing about an Industrial           Agreement between Prance and Germany to the           definite exclusion of any influence whatever           on the part of Great Britain.
     Tho  development *f tho groat steel and ironindustries of Lorraine is regarded as quitsimpossible) in present oiroustatanoes, owing to thewant, of Ruhr coal for coking purposes.,  prenohfinanciers, with an eye to the political Kile as wellas the economic, are offering very strong inducementsto the Germans to oomplete plans in. this&quot; direction.The Stinnoa-luberaad Agreement, assuming that itmatures,  is enly the fore-runner of a highly : rganisedplanJ&apos;f:or  an economic Franco-German policy which would ultimately mean that the direction and expansion of .the immense industrial possibilities of the Saar would bein Gorman hands with&apos; nominal French control, in exhange  for which France would virtually seourepolitical control of the continent of Europe.     We havo had ample evidenoe wf the overturesvjhich have been made by France to great Germanindustries and kartells regarding this matterand we cannot conceive any mere sinister movementfrtai the point uf View of the future of Britishindustry.We have be^n informal thai in every suggestion made at the instance ef French financiers andpoliticians it was pl&amp;lnly\ stated that FrahoOdesired thai England should have ne industrialinfluence oh the oontinent,     French negotiators with Germ&apos;an industrialshave stated that they are prepared to bring the pressure  of their organisation to bear upon theFrench government to have the French armies removedffWm the  occupied territory and would, moreover, do everything possible to modify the reparationdemands1 of France,The Cardinal &amp;ri3hbiahop of Munioh, who is a notedmonarchist, is using all his influence *n behalfof French pellcy in Bavaria and, in the view ofcertain leading Germans wh-  are themselves ardentReman Catholics, tho intrigues now bolng carriedon between Paris and Munich may succeed in dis-disturbing the unity which has f r s^ long subsistedamong the German States.The principal Gorman industrials, includingthe heads of the A*E*G. , the gx-oat chemicalcombine, Erupps, the Otto-Wolff group arid others,informed us that they. since rely desired ta oo-operate with British industry and were perfectlyprepared, if workable schemes could be devised,to make agreemantr^ which would give opportunities for mutually extending trade in all parts of theworld.    It is of course known that certain agree-ments of  this nature have already been made and are working in the case of Russia andRouinanla  with satisfaction to both sides.German industry is now being carried on withgreat vigour, but on absolutely unwholesomeand unstable foundations.   Owing to the collapse of the currency, manufacturers do not know                                       their/
    their position from, day to day;   all foreign    trade has to be conducted, by operating in    foreign currency and the German Home. Market    is abnormally enlarged as saving is impossible    and everyone desires to secure something    which possesses real value.(6)  German manufacturers look forward to the    coming winter with the. greatest alarm, as the    continued fail of the.mark must lead to    disaster - then&apos; comes unemployment and-    immediately masses of people become hungry    the out look, is certainijr serious.         It must be understood that the educated    German worker, with his knowledge of organ!3a-    tion and with his higher standard of life,    will be a much more dnagerous instrument in    the hands of bolshevist propaganda than the    Russian peasant.(7)  French propaganda is active everywhere in    Germany, &quot;but French military methods in the    Hhineland have spoiled what would otherwise    have been of much advantage to the new French :    policy.                           &apos;..(8)  Every German industrial has his eyes turned    towards&quot;Russia,and, in the- event of settled    conditions being arrived at in that country * .the    Germans hope ..to .establish an enormous trade..    Naturally, also.,., the Germans are exploiting In    every way possible, by their trained trade-    propagandists, the new States which have been    carved out in Austria.(9)  Apart from the economic chaos in German industry    the most serious factor in facing the German.    problem is the weakness of the German government.    We feel it would be distinctly to the advantage    of Great Britain that indication should be &apos;.    given that the British government was .    prepared, under carefully considered conditions ,    to give its moral support to the German    government in facing&quot; the internal dif ficirities    with which it is confronted,.  With a hopelessly    inadequate police force and with practically ;    no military organisation, the German government&apos;    is quite helpless to deal with socialist    antagonism and is bringing about the ruin of  *;    the country by making one,concession after    another.                    ... Yours sincerely,                      I. : .,(Sgd).  ALLAH H. SUITE. ;The Right I-Ionourable     David Lloyd George, 0.T-., M.P.,           10, Downing Street,                 S .W.1. .
