IN THENORTH-EASTERN DIVISION SOME SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT  HAS OCCURRED IN  THEIRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY, BUT PROSPECTS ARE NOT QUITE SO HOPEFUL AS FORMERLY.   ThePOSITION IN THE MIDLANDS  IS FAIRLY GOOD, BUT THE SITUATION IN WALES  IS complicated by THE DISPUTE IN THE EBBW YALE AREA.    IN SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP REPAIRING DEPRESSION REMAINS THE RULE.    ENGINEERING CONTINUES QUIET, AND  THE MOTOR-CYCLE AND MOTOR-CAR sections  inPARTICULAR ARE EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF SEASONAL  DEPRESSION.    THE PROSPECTS IN THE WOOLLEN AND  WORSTED INDUSTRY IN THE SCOTLAND DIVISIONREMAIN BRIGHT, BUT IN THE NORTH-EASTERN DIVISION WHAT  PREVIOUSLY  APPEARED  TOBE A HOPEFUL OUTLOOK HAS NOT MATERIALISED.  THE COTTON INDUSTRY REMAINS UNSETTLED,BUT, APART FROM THE  EFFECT OF THE  CRISIS  IN THE NEAR EAST, THE TENDENCY IS TOWARDSSLOW IMPROVEMENT.   DEPRESSION EXISTS  IN THE LACE INDUSTRY IN THE SOUTH-WESTERNDIVISION.   IN SCOTLAND THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT DECREASE  IN TRADE  IN COTTON ANDTEXTILES, WHILE THE LINEN AND JUTE  INDUSTRIES REMAIN AT A LOW LEVEL.    THE BUILDING INDUSTRY REMAINS QUIET GENERALLY, AND  although  IN THE  SOUTH-EASTERN DIVISION PROSPECTS APPEAR BRIGHTER,  ANY EXCEPTIONAL IMPROVEMENT MAY  BECOUNTERBALANCED TO SOME EXTENT BY SEASONAL  DEPRESSION.    REPORTS RECEIVED FROM THE NORTH-EASTERN DIVISION ON THE GLASS  INDUSTRY AREDISCOURAGING,  BUT  SOME IMPROVEMENT DUE TO SEASONAL CAUSES  IS APPARENT  IN THEMIDLANDS.    THE WELSH TINPLATE INDUSTRY IS  VERY  DEPRESSED,  AND  THE  COPPER AND  SPELTERWORKS IN THAT AREA ARE STATED TO BE IN A VERY PRECARIOUS STATE.                                        T.  J.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect  of a severe trade depression first became evident  in  the  early autumn of 1920.  On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at  a meetingof the Cabinet,  when  the Cabinet Unemployment  Committee was appointed toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.                        (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent  amendingActs modified the  conditions as regards  rates of benefit,  extended the periods ofbenefit and increased the contributions.   As from November 1921 the  unemployed workers&apos; Dependants&apos;  (Temporary Provision) Act,  1921, made temporary provisionfor grants  in  respect of  wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed aspecial levy to provide  for these grants.   The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922,which operates as  from the 6th April, 1922,  amalgamates the dependants&apos; grantswith Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment insurance contributions,  and  extends until  June  1923 the  special  periods  during which&quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn.  The authority to borrow money from theTreasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid  out  in Unemployment  Benefit (including Benefit in      respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8,      1920, to September 23, 1922.  (Figures for Northern and Southern Ireland      are included up to the 31st December, 1921,  and the  1st April,  1922,      respectively.)        Unemployment benefit and dependants&apos; benefit paid    96,037,000        Contributions  from             Employers      ...      ...       ...       ...    25,286,000            Employed persons        ...       ...       ...    23,036,000            State     ...      ......       ...       ...    15,376,000            State (in  respect of  benefit  for ex-regular                sailors,  soldiers and airmen)   ...       ...    2,318,000                                                           66,016,000        Balance of benefit paid over  contributions (pro-            yided mainly out of the accumulated reserve            fund of over 20 millions and advances  by the            Treasury  amounting to  14,350,000)       ...    30,021,0003. NUMBERS RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT AND NUMBERS ON SHORT TIME IN                               GREAT BRITAIN.    The number of persons paid benefit during the week ended the 25th september was 957,000* wholly unemployed and 22,591 on part-time.

A full statement of the measures taken in  the autumn of 1920 and of the latermeasures from autumn 1921 onwards  has been  set  out in previous issues of thisReport.   At least 250,000  men  have had employment on these schemes at  various times, and at the present  time over 96,000 men are employed, exclusive of the workprovided for men in ancillary  occupations and  the effect  of the Export  credits scheme (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR  EMPLOYED  IN  GREAT BRITAIN    AT  SEPTEMBER  22,  1922,  ON   CERTAIN  OF   THE  SCHEMES    REFERRED TO ABOVE.o , !
