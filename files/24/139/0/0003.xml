0telephone Message from Lord Hardinge,  (Paris),     Received lle45 a.m.  September 21st 1922.     Folldwing from Lord Curzon for Cabinet:**     Greatly obliged for kind words of encouragementfrom Cabinet,,   Meeting for tomorrow is fixed for  p.mc, owing to poincare&apos;&apos;s engagement in the morning.     Its object will be to arrive at a preliminaryunderstanding as to the conditions in which theallies will enter conference and which French will doubtless at once communicate to Kemalists with whom they are in the closest contactc   It will bea difficult tasks the Kemalists backed by France andItaly press for full acceptance of national pact ascondition of entering conference, and may raiseother objections such as choice of place of meeting,admission of Russia, retirement of Greeks fromThrace.   Against these pretentions my best argu-ments are     (1) absurdity of convoking conference in whichRoumania and Serbia are to take part and then decidemain issues in advance awl in their absence.     (2) Consciousness of France of moral weakness of her own position and deserting the allies fromadmitted motives of fear.     (3) Her genuine apprehension which was quiteapparent yesterday that we not only mean but are able to act alone.     The area which will have to be covered in discussion is as follows, and I will state seriatimthe positions which subject to the approval of theCabinet I propose to take up.
I may not be able to sustain them all withoutmodificationt but will do my best,     (1)  Constantinople.  Here we shall agree asin March last to hand back Constantinople and full sovereignty to the Turks after the ratification ofpeace.   All the allied garrisons will then be withdrawn.   Difficulty will be experienced in arranging for demilitarisation of Asiatic shore of Bosphorus.   But steps will have to be taken under the supervision of the League of Nations,as provided for later on to secure that door-way of Black Sea is not closed and that fortifications-tions and batteries are not placed on the Bosphorus.    (2)  Thrace,  Here French will press (a) forthe complete and immediate evacuation of Thraceby the Greeks; (b) for the recognition of the maritza frontier.   I absolutely declined yesterdayto go so far on the ground that it would beanticipating work of conference.   Suggestion i made and propose to repeat is that if neutral zone at Ismid Peninsula is respected by Kemal,Greek forces shall for similar reasons, i.e.protection  of Constantinople - be withdrawn be-hind the Enos-Istranja line proposed at Marchconference.All
       All  evidence is that Greek army in Thrace isin  a  state  of considerable demoralisation.  Svorzaread  telegrams showing that country is in a state of complete anarchy and that Greeks are incapableeither of maintaining order or, if left in Thracejof  holding  it.       He is very likely therefore to propose some form  of light occupation.  This.would mean groups which I am  sure that Italy would not provide andwhich France would not be too keen to furnish.       Immediate recognition of Turkish sovereigntymay also be pressed for, but here again . I shallargue that  this is doing work of conference inadvance.       When we come to question of future frontierFrance and  Italy will press for Maritza and will be strengthened by avowed acceptance of that line bySerbia.     I will ascertain today what are the exactviews of Serbian king and minister and if possiblealso of Roumania on the subject.  Our attitude mustbe determined by broad consideration of Britishimperial interests.  If we can safeguard Gallipoliposition, which is cardinal point for us, I do not know that it is of vital importance to us at whatexact point boundary line is drawn.  Much moreimportant will be future form of government and con**trol in Thrace.       Here it may be prudent to revive the idea,which was discussed and abandoned in March, of creating an autonomous state in Eastern Thrace underLeague of Nations,  while allowing symbol of Turkish                                          sovereignty
sovereignty in the shape of a, flag or some otherinoculous emblem.    Success would depend on willing-ness of League of Nations to accept charge,  and of interested powers and states to provide requisitegendarmerie or police.   Area will have to bedemilitarised. A good deal will depend on theattitude of Serbia and Roumania as to which I will report later.       I shall argue on Friday that it is not forus to fix final boundaries now, but merely to form-ulate general ideas in our own minds.  monsieur poincare thinks that Turks will be rather favourable to League of Nations idea as less wounding to theirpride and as carrying with it their own participationwhen admitted to League.       Finally we come to Dardanelles,   French nowknow that sooner than ahandon this position we shall take and hold it alone,  and to this Poincare&apos;attitude yesterday shows that they are in greatapprehension.   It should therefore not be difficultto arrange for occupation by allied and other forces under auspices of League of Nations.   I proposeto ask Serbia and Roumania whether they would contribute.    If difficulties are raised I  always have lever of British intention in background.Technical Turkish sovereignty might be admitted andeven a flag flown.       When Admiral Grasset contended yesterday thatappearance of Kemalists at Chanak would renderGallipoli position untenable, I at once used hisargument, which is I believe wholly fallacious, topoint out to Poincare that if Gallipoli is to beheld, which he admitted, Chanak must therefore either                                               be/
be held also or be  $militarised as proposed inMarch.   This he could not deny, and we shall have i think to arrange,  after all forts or gun positionshave been destroyed that periodic visits are paidby officers of Gallipoli force to see that nothing is being done.     I shall add that intervention of League ofNations in Thrace may admit of guarantees to Bulgariaof rail exit to Dedeagatch without any territorialconcession which her neighbours I am sure would decline to allow.     Foregoing is general sketch of policy which Ishould like to advocate tomorrow.     If modified by later information I will tele-graph again.   But I would ask for discretion tomove within reasonable limits;  and of course thedefiant attitude of Kemalists may at any moment bringfabric to the ground.   On the other hand public in-tention of Allies to hold very early conference willmake it increasingly difficult for Kemal to move.
