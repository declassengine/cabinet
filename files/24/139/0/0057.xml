SELECT COMMITTEE ON TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT OF                         DISABLED EX-SERVICE MEN.                 MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.               I give in an appendix the summarised recommendations of          the recent Report of the Select Committee on tho Training and          Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men.               Briefly,  the Committee, relying in the main on local          enthusiasm, recommend the delegation of the problem of          finding employment for disabled men to Committees set up under          statute for Counties and County Boroughs and co-ordinated by          means of a statutory National Council.  Tho Select Committee          conclude by recommending that should the results by 1st May,          1923, not show that the problem has beon successfully dealt          with on the lines proposed, recourse should thon be had to          compulsion.               I think it greatly open to doubt whether any form of          machinery can solve this problem without the help of a revival          in trade, and in my opinion the Committee have not appreciated          sufficiently that the existing arrangements are largely          decentralised and were designed with the object of utilising          local effort and local enthusiasm.               But 1 agree with the Committee that nothing but local          effort can have any chance of solving the problem in present          circumstances and I think we should give a trial to a plan          broadly on the lines they suggest.                         LOCAL KING&apos;S ROLL COMMITTEES.               I propose therefore to take steps at once to set up for          each considerable urban authority a King&apos;s Roll Committee          to deal with:-                                                              A a)
     (a)  the local adiq^jxLstration of the King&apos;s Rollj .     (b)  special provision for severely disabled ex-service          men;     (c)  provision of improverships for trainees:     (d)  organisation;- of a system of after-care, so far          as necessary.     I do not think these bodies should be statutory at thepresent stage.  Statutory authority is not necessary, andwould lead to the establishment of a now and untrainedbureauoracy, besides increasing the danger of friction withthe Local Employment Committees.     The Local Employment Committees, which...repre3ent--c)rganisedemployers and workpeople in the locality, have hitherto been responsible for the local administration of the King&apos;s Roll.We must be careful not to forfeit their good-will in makingthe change.     What I propose to do, therefore, is to approach the LordMayors, Lord Provosts, Mayors etc., and concurrently the chairmen of Local Employment Committees, asking thorn to confertogether as to the steps to be taken to form., in each locality,a local King&apos;s Roll Committee and suggesting that the local employment Committee, strengthened if necessary by the additionof a few other members, should act as the executive authority.The Ministry of Labour will place the services of their staff and premises at the disposal of tho new committees, and in thisway the additional staff, and other expenses entailed by tho new procedure, will be reduced to a minimum.       In the  case of  county areas  outside  the districts covered by the new Committees, 1  should propose in goneral,  to defer action for the present.     The main work of the Committees would be to  &apos;  stimulate the i ing&apos;s Roll.  I do not propose that  the Committees should have authority to incur
3.289expenditure upon sohemes for the employment of severelydisabled men, hut they would encourage such schemes as lord Roberts; Workshops, and,- if necessary.call our attention to any such scheme, which appeared worthy ofand to call for assistance.   The Committees might alsoexercise a certain amount of supervision over local schemes..     The finding of improverships is a technical jobrequiring Individual attention e.g. by canvassers, and itwould not bo appropriate to make the Committees responsiblefor this,,  The assistance they can give will be mainly in thedirection of bringing pressure to bear on employers throughthe force of local opinion,     The Select Committee do not make any specific recommendation with regard to the consideration of wafter-care&apos;&quot; schemes and this seems to be a matter which is betterleft to local development.           KING&apos;S ROLL NATIONAL COUNCIL.    .1 propose also to adopt the recommendation to have awKing&apos;s Roll national council&apos;&apos;, though not on a statutory basis;  and I propose to invite Earl Haig&apos; to be Chairman,-.It is not practicable to give the National Council power to&quot;supervise and co-ordinate the activities of the County and county Boroughs Committees&quot;.  Local bodies, as is vfcellknown, object to any interference by a Central Councilof this kind.  The King1s Roll National Council will,however, be given &quot;general control&quot;, as recommended bytho select Committee,  and in particular will be empoweredto decide questions as to eligibility for the King&apos;&apos;s Roll,              ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.     -No remuneration will be paid to tho members of thenew Committees but travelling expenses etc., will have tobe defrayed./The
     The Select Committee recommended that the King&apos;n RollCommittees should bo set up forthwith and as it is important that we should be able to say,  when Parliament meets, that theCommittees are in fact boing established, I proposo to ftoton the lines of this Memorandum,  unless any of my colleaguesdissent./In     The cost of staff will be kept at a minimum by the use ct[existing staff of the Ministry as.far as possible,  but as thisstaff is at present very fully occupied, tho now proposals will inevitably entail somo additional cost for staff;  the additional staff will, of course, be temporary.     It is difficult t(D say precisely what the expenditure will amount to but it is thought the expenses of the Committees and the additional staff to 31st March, 1923, will not exceed -50,000.     It will, be necessary to place a sum for local publicityat the disposal of the Committees and it is proposed that aBum of  5,000 shall be granted in the first place;   if theschomo chould dovolop,, local pressure might necessitate a largersum, say, up to  25,000.     No Supplementary Estimate will bo necessary in tho current year as the expondituro can bo met out of savings.     The proposal in this Memorandum that Lord Mayors, LordProvosts, Mayors and Provosts chould be asked to participatehas been concurred in by tho Ministry of Health and the scottish office.     The Treasury have been consulted and do not offerobjection to these proposals.  They will, of course, beconsultod as to the detailed carrying out of tho proposals.
                             5.     In this connection I may say that Ma jorK^eneral Sir sL.Davidson, M.P., the Chairman of the Coimn.ittee , wrote to me underdate 20th September, to tho effect that he was desired by his committee to enquire whether It was the intention of theGovernment to take action on the lines recommended, and to take such action *&apos;ith the least possible delay.   He called later,with Colonel Henderson, M.P., to see me and to urge the earlyadoption of the recommendations in the Report.   I have also received a deputation from the British Legion on the subject.                              (Si signed)  T.J. MAC NAMAHA.Ministry of Labour,  5th October, 1922.
APPENDIX.    Extract from the Report of the Select Committeeon Training and Employment of Disabled Ex-Service Men.XIV. - SUMMARY OP RECOMMENDATIONS.      Your Committee make tho following recommondations     (l) That a further effort should be mado to obtainemployment for disabled men on a voluntary baois by partiallyrecasting the exicting voluntary systom.     (2) That the principle to be adopted should be that ofdecentralisation and devolution of duties and responsibilities to local bodies, with local knowledge and local onthuciasm,whoso corviceo in general should be honorary.     (3) That local ad hoc voluntary committees with certain limited statutory powors should bo oet up In each oounty and county borough to be known as tho King&apos;s Roll County or county Borough Committees.     (4) That the duties of those committees should bo toprovide employment for disabled men under four headings :-           (a) Special provision for severely disabled                 ox-Sorvice mon:           (b) Tho administration of the&apos; King&apos;s Roll;           (c) Provision of improverships for trainees;           (d) Organisation of a systom of after-care                 ouitablo to local conditions.     (5) That tho King&apos;s Roll County and County BoroughCommittees should be prosidod over by Lords Lieutenant andLord Mayors, Mayors, &amp;c, and that their membership should include local influential persons, representatives ofomployors, trades unions, ox-Sorvice mon*s organisations,Rod Cross, also of Local War Pensions and Local EmploymentOommittoce.   Further, that it should ho within the discretion of theso committoes to appoint such sub-committees as may beroquirod in boroughs and districts for tho purpose of obtainingpersonal touch with industrial concerns, but personal touchboing vital to tho success of a scheme of this nature.     (6) That the King&apos;s Roll County and County BoroughCommittees should have a legal status and bo entrusted withcertain financial powers within the limits of well-definedregulations, but with discretion within those limits.     (7) That a central statutory body, a Kir^s Roll national council, should be cot up to control generally, supervise and                                             /co-ordinate
co-ordinate the activities of the County and County BoroughCommitteoB, and that it should be composed of representativesof both Houses of Parliament, of all Government Departmentsooneerned, of employers, trades unions, and ex-Sorvioe men*organisations.   This body should work undor tho aegis of andderive its power from the Ministry of Labour, whioh would beresponsible for tho provision and regulation of public funds.     (8) That the problem of the severely disabled ex-Servicoman should bo dealt with by the KING&apos;s Roll County and CountyBorough Committees on the linos laid down in paragraph X,i.o., by the encouragement of voluntary institutions and homeindustries with limited State assistance.     (9) That tho King*s National Roll should be administered by the King&apos;s Roll National Council and County and OountvBorough Committees on the lines suggested in paragraph XI.    (10) That the training of disabled ex-Sorvioe men shouldbe carried out by the Ministry of Labour as heretofore, andthat the rocoraraordatione in connection with training and government instructional factories referred to in paragraphXII should be put into operation.   Further, that the duty of finding improverships for trainees should be transferred tothe Kingks Roll County and County Borough Committees.    (11) That the King&apos;s Roll National Council and the King&apos;sRoll County and County Borough Committees should bo sot up at once as advisory bodies pending legislation required togive these bodies tho necessary statutory powers.    tl2) That, in shorty the principle of docontralisationand devolution of authority and power should bo adopted witha viow to making the bost use of local knowledge, localenthusiasm, and local conditions.    (13) Your Committee cannot ostimato whether theeo rocom-metidations, if carriod out, will secure the object in view,namely, the fulfilment of the special responsibility of theoountry towards dlBablod mon as defined in paragraph III (l),,cince Your Committeo are unable to detormine the spirit inwhich they would bo put into operation,   They embodysuggestions as to the only conditions undor which, in theopinion of Your Committeo, tho voluntary system can succeed.But Your Committoo desire to add that a most careful checkshould be kept of the numbers of disabled men out of employmentduring the next twelvo months.         So urgent is the problem that Your Committeereoommend that their proposals should bo carried into effectforthwith, and the necessary legTslationpassed during  theAutumn Sossion.   But should tho figure s &quot;*s how that the problem has not by the 1st May, 1923, beoh successfully doalt with onthe&quot;&quot;mines proposed, &quot;recourse should  than&quot;bo had to a form of compulsion modified In character and scope as circumstances may dictate.
