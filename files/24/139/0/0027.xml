HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)        SITUATION,INjIRELAND.      REPORT BY MAJOR ^HlTTAKER.(Circulated by Secretary of State for the Colonies,)                                      19th September; 1922,Sir,     In accordance .with your request I have the honour tosubmit the following observations on the present situationin Ireland,   I arrived in Dublin on June 27, remainedthere during the initial period of hostilities and left for Ennis, Co. Clare on July 13.   From that time until september 6th I remained in. the South and was present with.the National troops In many actions in counties- Clare,,.Limerick, Tipperary, Kerry and Cork.     During the whole period of my visit I was  closely  intouch&apos; with the National Army and with the Irish &quot;people.I rarely met loyalists or people of gentle birth.  the strongest impression left on me was In regard to the naturalsuspicion of the entire race.  Not only was a stranger  dis-trusted but even those fighting on the Free State side  were regarded doubtfully when any unusual incident brought theirrespective names into prominence.  The masses considerEngland - it is characteristic that they never  say British -as a nation of Infinite subtlety plotting constantly thedownfall of innocent and browbeaten races,  &quot;ith them defeatis&apos; always a sign of innocence.  Intensely sentimental,  theirlove  for decorative funerals is in keeping with their                                                   creation/              -&quot;-;.&apos;        E -1-                                                                   1
creation of national martyrs.   The foulest murder is  condonedin the resultant punishment&apos;(&quot;hen any is inflicted).Possessed, of little inherent, regard for human life,  death isstill a crowning horror^  en incident to he avoided at all costs.     The sympathy of ninety per cent.of the country is withthe Free State.  The people regard the Treaty as a stoptowards temporary peace - even at the worst.  In generalthey believe that the &quot;war&quot; of 1919-1920 was a completevictory for Ireland and that England could not have  continuedher repressive efforts.  This, it should be noted, ic not theview of those in power.  Of the methods adopted by the BritishGovernment there is strong and undying orlticism.  Some ofthis may be due to a natural dislike for efficient methods anda definite policy, but the greater part of  the  criticism andhate has been caused.entirely by the &quot;Black and Tans&quot; whoseconduct was undoubtedly often reprehensible.  Ill consideredkillings, very frequent drunkenness and bad discipline are thechief reasons why  the &quot;Black and Tans&quot; failed to link respectwith the definitely produced fear. . The people had nothingagainst the troops and spoke highly of the military  standardof honour.  Old women far too stupid, to temper the truth v ithnational propaganda  say that on many occasions British regl-ments saved them  (in  some cases by. a display of force) fromoutrage by the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;.     The people dislike the irregulars firstly because theyare the casue of present disturbances and  Secondly because ofthe thefts and the destruction which are part of their policy.A  ver:/  small percentage support the Republicans,  some becausethey  are  still bitterly opposed to anything which has thesanction  of Great  Britain  and because in   some past  time theyhave  lost  someone  dear to them in  what they consider to have                                                        been/
been a wa$, and some because they have the Irish instinctof approval for&apos; the under dOg.     For some years past the well-horn Irishman has ceased to take any part in the&quot;Government of the country eithernational or local.  The signing of the Treaty and theCreation of the Provisional Government excluded the ra-maining remnants of the normal governing class.  To-dayaffairs are in the hands of the middle classes  v-ith a few of even lower worldly standing.  As is customary in a revolution of this type the university professor and the professional idealist have  come to the front and with theusual results.  Utterly removed from the practical issues of life, they are apt to think that government can proceedaccording to theoretic principle.  The results are disastrous.     The lower class leaders hold&apos;their position by virtueof the legendary name they gained during the murders of theIrish War.  Utterly inexperienced, wildly prejudiced, it isonly a matter of time before the people discover theirshallowness.  But in the meantime they may do considerableharm.     Mr. CosgraVe is a Dublin tradesman without imaginationand. without appeal to the masses,  He is practical  andprefers definite administrative work to success in debate.Mono of the original Provisional Government he was able tocarry on the work of his office,,  and his desire to avoidrhetoric and be a real minister seriously annoyed Mr, de valera and his colleagues,  Mr, Mulcahy is said to be aman of the highest personal honour, ready to trust until he Is deceived,  During the troubles he had many of theadventures since attributed to Mr, Collins,  He is 7/ell*educated,  and has a breadth of view a little rare amongFree State Irishmen.  As - yet he has not got the popularappeal of Michael Collins.
     Patrick Hcgan,  tho Minister of Agriculture,  is a man of high ability who has s future of distinction if theFree State survives.     Michael Collins himself was in your own terms the11 oorner boy&quot; in excelsis.  He was boisterous and lovedpopularity.  Personally courageous, he had no militar:/&quot;ability.  Possessed of an infinite power of work, he wouldin later days have lost his entire reputation.  He had not sufficient statesmanship to survive oven in Ireland.  Mr.,Collins considered the Treaty to bo a step towards indepond-ence.   There is little doubt that the majority of  theleaders will if they succeed in restoring peace,  break away from England without waiting for further sanction.,     The man who desires to lead Ireland must possess a nameknown favourable to the  entire country and surrounded bysome manner of glamour whatever might be the source.  There isno such man in Ireland at the moment.     In the background are a few men of note who may in thefuture become prominent in Ireland.  One of these, Commandant-General Seumas Hogan, is in normal times Professor of ModernHistory at Cork University.  He is free from most  academicoddities,  and has studied history with sufficient  care tomake him doubtful of most human motives.  He agrees  with deTocquoville that revolution merely alters labels without any real effect on conditions of government.  Passion  has notblinded him tc the  fact that statesmanship  is- as much a  pro-fession as dentistry.  Enthusiastic  on behalf ,of Ireland, heis not  ignorant of  his own people&apos;s  faults.               *     There are no Elder  Statesmen  in  Ireland.  None  of theleaders are over forty years of age  and. few  arc  over thirty.In  that lies the explanation of many unexpected  events.                              -4-
     The National Army consists almost entirely of veryyoung Irishmen without greater military experience than wasgained in the &quot;murder&quot; campaign of 1919-1920.  Morally theyare sound, and. only a small percentage drink heavily.  Pewof them, are- fit to be trusted with firearms and fewer still have any&apos; idea of discipline.  Properly led they would beexcellent soldiers, but unfortunately their officers are Inthe majority completely Inoompetent.  Most of them hold their ranks because in the anti-English campaign they snoweddaring In the killing of English soldiers,  All but a fewdrink heavily, and consider present hostilities merely as an easy means of making a living.     The organisation of the army is curious.  There is ageneral-officer to every forty or fifty men.  divisions are rarely four hundred strong end battalions have no definite establishment.  Pew general-officers have had any military training, though somo have endeavoured to supplthe deficiency by careful reading.  Among them are someretired regular officers of the British army whose services are invaluable0  They are hampered in their work by theinexperience Of their seniors, but little by little they aremaking themselves felt.  The administrative services areludicrously inadequate.  Rations are  either issued in unneedquantities or are  forgotten altogether,  Accommodation Isnot often arranged in advance for incoming troops, and inconsequence movements are rarely completed without almostinextricable confusion.  In action, vhen properly led, themen are excellent.  Under bad leadership they straggle anddisplay every symptom of complete cowardice.  They are over-excited by apparent success and, as  with Colonial troops,neglect all reasonable precautions after a successful advancI have seen officers first order and then ask over eighty
MEN before they could find ten rank and file willing toundertake guard duty.     The military position Is at the moment none too clear.The irregulars hold no great towns or true strategic points.THEY avoid open battle with curious skill.  But in bands of thirty-five they range the country attacking convoys and roadcolumns, creating disturbances at night and spreading a feeling of insecurity throughout Southern Ireland.  Indlvid-actuals in their ranks are willing to murder Free State troopsin the streets of great cities, trusting.to the complacencyof crowds to make their escape certain.  If caught they put their hands up,  and rely on what they consider to be thechivalry of war.     THE Free State Forces, uncertain of the FUTURE, are unwilling to punish outrage by death.  Consequently MENknown to have killed under  conditions of treachery are alltoo frequently Imprisoned for a few,days and are thenRELEASED quietly,  There can be no peace    In  Ireland untilTHE Government adopts drastic measures and  shoots ENOUGHIrregulars to make the creation of martyrs  an  occupationtoo crowded for  common amusement.     The young man of Ireland has learnt under easyCONDITIONS the pleasures and  the  licence  of military life.,and few of them  will care to  return quietly to a life  of peaceful work.   They have learnt  the power  of  the gun,  andit WILL be a long time before they  can be  induced to forget.     There is  considerable  complaint amongst the higher -command about the delays in the supply of rmmitions from  -England.,  and there is some  suspicion that  British authoritiesare unwilling  to part with  further  equipment in view of thepossibility of later trouble  between the  two countries..
The ammunition supply for the 18 pdrs was uansatJLsfa-c-toTXj________and there was- also a noticeable lack of small arms of all categories-.     The irregulars 2o not. lack supplies.  Their arms have come in large quantities from America until the last month or two.  Other supplied have come from the continent -possibly from France arid Belgium.     If stable government is to be i^estored in the countryand if the upper classes are to take  any adequate part,  well-born people must begin their work at, the present time.   Ifmen possessing experience of government, or officers  retiredfrom Irish regiments in the British  service offered  their assistance to the Free State  without any qualification  asto the initial positions given them,  they might in later dayshelp greatly to direct the destinies  of the country.   If isuseless for people  of this class to  sit in London cursingthe Irish,  Their true place is to help their own countryout of the mud.     No Statesman would be wise to think lightly  of  a  Britishreturn to  Ireland unless nine-tenths of  the country  askedunequivocally .for  our intervention.   It  would be  impossiblefor England to -restore peace to Ireland without the  employmentof an  army of at lea.3t 200,000  and an expenditure of many millions.  Even then it would  be  an  armed  occupation.   Thepeople would never  be - sympathetic to English  rule.   Theymust  shape their  own destinies,  and  if the  task is hard itwill  at  least explain to them  some  of the  difficulties whichhave harassed England in its attempt to  govern Ireland.                     I have  the honour to  be, Sir,                         Year  obedient Servant,                         .(Signed) W.E.  de  B.EHITTAKER,                                              Major.                                 : The King&apos;s  Regt.
