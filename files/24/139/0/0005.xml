Period ended September 15,  1922.                           THE  SITUATION.    In the coal-mining  industry  noticeable  improvement is  reported  from  alldistricts.    The position in the iron and steel industry in the North-Eastern Division shows signs of improvement; in fact, slight improvement is reported from almost all other districts.    Shipbuilding and repairing remains depressed  generally, but an encouragingsign is a report that some orders for new  constructional work  are in hand in theNorth-Eastern  Division.    The engineering industry is still  very  quiet generally.    The woollen and worsted  industry in the North-Eastern  Division continuesactive.  The cotton industry is very unsettled, although the fine-spinning section is still fully employed.   The lace industry  in the Midlands shows slight revival.    In Scotland the overseas trade in hosiery and lace is well maintained, and thecotton and textile trades are in good condition.    The linen and jute trades arestill dfirj^fisserl.    The building  industry is  generally quiet, and the  improvement previously reported in the South-Western  Division has not been maintained.    Employers inthe South-Eastern Division, however, consider the prospects for the coming winterto be brighter than last year.    A temporary revival of the glass bottle industry  has  occurred  in the North-Eastern Division,  but in  the South-Eastern  Division the glass  trade is furtherdepressed.    Discharges  are  taking  place from   Government  establishments  under thearrangements for the cessation of short-time working.                                       T. J.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]                      Cabinet Unemployment Committee,    The prospect  of a severe trade depression first became evident in the  early autumn of 1920.  On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof the Cabinet,  when  the Cabinet Unemployment  Committee was appointed  toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.                        (A.) Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came  into operation on the8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously.  Subsequent amendingActs modified the conditions as regards  rates  of benefit,  extended the periods.ofbenefit and increased the contributions.   As from November 1921 the unemployed workers&apos; Dependants&apos;  (Temporary Provision) Act,  1921, made temporary provisionfor grants in  respect of wives, dependent  husbands and children, and imposed aspecial levy to provide  for these grants.   The Unemployment Insurance Act,  1922,which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the  dependants&apos; grantswith Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment insurance contributions,  and  extends until  June  1923  the  special periods  during  which&quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn.  The authority to borrow money from theTreasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit  (including Benefit  in      respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November  8,      1920, to September 9, 1922.
