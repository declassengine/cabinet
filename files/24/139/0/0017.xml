POLITICAL.Decypher.   Lord Hardinge (Paris).                           22nd September 1922.            D.   10.25 p.m. 22nd September 1922.            R.   9.30 a.m.  23rd September 1922.No. 474.VERY URGENT.            Following for Sir W. Tyrrell from Lord Curzon.            Please communicate to Cabinet following-      telegram from Sir H.  Rumbold.            &quot;General Harington appears very  anxious about      situation at Constantinople.  It should be      realised that we are living on a sort  of  volcano.      Many undesirable elements have drifted to the      town and it is known that some 20,000  Turks and      probably an equal number of Greeks are armed.      The force at his disposal consists of  three      battalions two of which are very weak  indeed.  If      French  and Italians do not assist in maintaining      order in the town in the event of a rising he feels      that his force would be inadequate to  defend      approaches to Scutari and put down rising.  This      might  entail abandonment of Constantinople at      short notice.  I personally believe that  Brench      who have fairly strong force here would be obliged      in  self defence to help to maintain order but I                                            think
think it urgent that we should obtain an immediate and categorical statement from French and italian governments as to their intentions in this matter.I note from your telegram No.  404 that Lord  Beattyis confident that navy  can prevent capture ofConstantinople from Asiatic side of Bosphorus,  hutAdmiral Brock informs me he does not concur  thatnavy can do this unless; approaches to Constantinopleare held by navy.  He has so reported to Admiralty.If we had to leave Constantinople owing to defect&quot;ion of our Allies Mustapha Kemal would he in aposition to move troops across to Europe.     Wives and children of British officers  andmen are embarking tomorrow and arrangements  havebeen made to embark British colony at very short notice.&quot;
