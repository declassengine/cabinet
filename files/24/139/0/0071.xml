This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government,;                                                    Copy No.I Bl C  RET.1 CP.  4872.C A B I N 3 T.     ITote hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer.         I circulate for the information of  the  cabinet a memorandum which has Been laid Before the  ReparationCommission hy Sir John Bradbury.   I  should  perhapsmake it clear that this memorandum is put forward bySir John Bradbury in his capacity as  a member  of theCommission and on his own responsibility.R,S.H.Treasury Chambers,  S.Y/.1.  11th October,  1922.
                        The British Delegate  f*                             to                       The Reparation Commission.       The British Delegate invites the urgent attention of the  Reparation Commission to the proposals contained in the accom-  accompanying  memorandum.       In view of the progressive deterioration in the German  financial situation as evidenced by the continuous  decline of  the mark exchanges and the acceleration of the progress of in-  flation and of general dislocation of credit in Germany,  he is  of opinion that immediate action on these or similar lines iB  imperatively necessary.      Sir John Bradbury is aware that proposals emanating from  the French Government for the calling of an Inter-Allied Con-  ference to consider the whole question of reparation and Inter-  Allied debts are under consideration by the other Allied Govern-  ments.  It is clear,  however, that even if such a conference is  held at the earliest possible date - say,  the end of November -  its euccess oi&quot; failure will in large measure depend on the con-  ditions actually existing when it assembles.      If no steps are taken in the meantime to arrest the pro-  cess of financial disintegration in Germany,  already well under  way, there is a danger that conditions before the Conference meets  will have become so chaotic as to have destroyed for the time being  any possible basis for fixing German liabilities on a permanent  footing - an indispensable preliminary to the consideration of  any consequential re-adjustments of Inter-Allied indebtedness.      Whether in any case the position in the near future is likelyInto be such as to allow a comprehensive treatment of reparations  and cognate matters to be attempted with success is now open to
 doubt.     In the early summer of this year at the time of the ap- pointment of the Bankers&apos; Committee by the Reparation Commission, Sir John Bradbury was of opinion that if the unanimous consent of the Allied Governments could have been obtained for the prin- ciple of accepting such adjustments of the Peace Treaty liabilities- ties as might in the opinion of practical financiers be necessary to re-establish German credit, a solution of the Reparation pro-blem by means of foreign loans might have been found.  If at the end of July the difficulties which arose in regard to the oontin-continuance of cash payments by Germany had been promptly dealt with, the situation, though by that time appreciably worse, might still have been saved.  But now with the mark over 2000 to the dollarunless some measure of confidence can be restored,  the possibility-lity of establishing budget equilibrium in Germany,  even ifPeace Treaty liabilities are entirely suspended, seems to beso remote that it is doubtful whether,  even if the  Allied Gov- ernments.were to consent to reductions in their&apos;creances;.verymuch larger/than the most moderate amongst then)/have hitherto been prepared to contemplate,  the floating of&apos;German foreign                                            iloans would be a practicable proposition.     If deterioration proceeds at its prespht pace  for another two months the position may be desperate before the Conference takes place.     If on the other hand an improvement c^uld be effected, the atmosphere would be more hopeful; and erejd if a complete settle-ment could not be looked for in the immediate future, the founda- tions might be laid for useful action later.     There is, however, little chance of creating such an atmosphere- phere until the present uncertainty as to the demands which are^ likely to be made upon Germany in respect of Peace Treaty
charges in 1923 and 1924 has been removed.     It appears to Sir John Bradbury,  therefore,  to be the clearduty of the Reparation Commission to deal with the question ofthese demands without further delay with a view to such remedial action as may be possible.  Such auction,  so far from prejudicing the solution of the problems with which the proposed conference is intended to deal,  is rather a necessary preparation forapproaching them.5.1C.22.
                 THE FTOURS OF REPARATION .          I  am convinced  that unless immediate  steps are taken to&quot;improve  and stabilize  the exchange value of the mark, a breakdown of  the German financial  structure which will be destructive to all hcpes of obtaining reparation,  either in cash  or kind, for many years to come,  if not  for ever, is inevitable.          If action is  delayed until German internal prices have adjusted themselves to the present exchange of 2000 marks tc the dollar (even if the  rate goes  no worse, as it almost certainly will do  unless early remedial action Is  taken), the difficulties of establishing budget equilibrium, even if Peace Treaty payments both in  cash  and kind are suspended  altogether, will be very great*          I am definitely of opinion that if matters are allowed  tc drift, such entire suspension will before very long become unavoidable,  and that  the longer the grant of  it is delayed, the longer the  period of suspension will have to beo          If it is delayed until the collapse  of the German foreign exchanges is complete, I believe a break-up of economic and social order in Germany will  follow, and, if this takes place, the process of  rebuilding will be  a  very long and painful  one, involving in ali. probability as an Indispensable preliminary the entire remission of the reparation liability.            If any further increase of the floating debt could be stopped, there would at  the  present moment be  no  serious difficulty In  the way  of stabilizing the exchange  value of  the mark at any reasonable  figure (say,  between the limits of  500 marks and 1009 marks to the dollar) which those responsible might  see fit  to  select                             the All that Is necessary  Is that/Reichsbank should  sell  gold freely for
paper marks at  tho rate seleoted.          Such a policy (always on the assumption that there will berio further addition to the floating debt) Involves no serious riskof depleting the gold reserve.         The present circulation Is,  even at an exchange of 500 marksto the dollar, quite inadequate to the needs of the country.   once the creation of new floating debt oomes to an end, there are only three ways In which jadditionaj currency can be obtained by thepublic:-     (a)  By the discounting with the Relchsbank of German Government   Treasury Bills now held by the public (amounting on 23rd September   1922 to about 75 milliard marks),      (b)  By the withdrawal of existing deposits in the Reichsbank   (which Inclusive of liabilities classified under &quot;miscellaneous&quot;   at the same date stood at 83 milliards),       Co)  By the creation of new credit by the Reichsbank.         The maximum amount theoretically obtainable under (a) and(b) is 158 milliards;  In practice,  it would be much less,  for,though no doubt the bulk of the Treasury Bills still held by thepublic would either be presented for  discount or have to be replacedat maturity by new Bills discounted with the Reichsbank,  the depositsare not oapable of unlimited reduction.           It is certain,  therefore,  that recourse would have to be                                       Xhad on a very considerable scale to  (c),  and, as the creation of newX.  Indeed this Is in fact already happening notwithstanding the    continued expansion of the floating debt, by reason of the    decline In the value of the mark having for the moment out-    stripped the progress of inflation.  The Reichsbank1 s holding    of Bills and Cheques Increased between 30th June and 23rd Sept.    from 4*8 milliards to no less than 43 milliards.
                                                              -     5 0 5.credits by  the Reichsbank  is entirely optional, the controlof the Bank over  the  currency would be complete.   The  Bank wouldthen be able  to protect  its gold and maintain  the foreign exchangesby the time-honoured  methods -  though necessarily in the firstinstance at the cost  of  an acute credit crisis.   Such  a crisis has,however, to be faced  in  any case if serious attempts at financialreform are  to be  taken in  hand.          The above plan is, however, only feasible if  furtherinflation can be  avoided - otherwise it will merely result in the reichsbank  gradually  losing its gold withou.t acquiring  the controlnecessary to  stop the rot.          Unless  and until the  credit of  the German Government is re-established, inflation  can only be stopped  by covering Governmentoutgoings by taxation.          With an exchange anywhere in the neighbourhood of 500 marksto the dollar, this condition could be secured withoxrt  serious-difficulty  if ieace Treaty charges were completely suspended.  I doubt,however, whether  it is possible If any appreciable provision has tobe made for Peace Treaty charges in 1923, or anything more than quite a modest provision in 1924.          Quite apart from payments in foreign currency, the papermark payments in  respect of deliveries in kind, even on the scale ofthis year, would  make the  task  a difficult one, while any Increase inthe deliveries in kind above the present  level would almost certainlymake it Impossible.          Kith an exchange of 1,000 marks to the dollar the task ofbalancing the budget  would be still more  difficult but  not I  thinkhopeless if the Peace Treaty charges could be  entirely  suspended.          On the  other hand, a  complete moratorium in respect ofall leace Treaty  obligations, both in cash and kind, not only is
impossible for political reasons but economically might have serious consequences to the Allied countries principally inter-ested in reparation.          Is there no way out of the impasse?          There Is ore way, and I think only one.   To the extentto which Peace Treaty payments, either in cash or in kind, are called for in excess of the provision which can be made for themin the budget, credit facilities must be provided for the GermanGovernment.          In present circumstances, the only countries whichhave any Inducement to provide such facilities are those re-ceiving the payments.          My proposal is          (l)  That all oash payments for Peace Treaty charges(including costs of Armies of Occupation, reparation, corn-positions for restitution, clearing offices balances, and miscellaneous obligations) falling due between 1 January,1923i and 31 December, 1924, should be met by German Treasuryfive-year bond3 to be delivered to the Reparation Corn-mission and distributed to the respective Governments in-interested in the same manner as the cash would have beendistributed if payment had been made in cash.          (2)  That in respect of all deliveries in kind, ser-vices rendered etc., within the same period for which credithas to be given to Germany under the Peace Treaty the GermanGovernment should be notified month by month of the amountsdebited, to each Allied Government,, and should be allowed toobtain from each such Govex&apos;nment a guarantee of GermanTreasury five-year bonds to the amount so debited,
0     This option would no doubt in the event of a considerable im-   provement taking place in the gold value of the currency of a   guaranteeing country be very costly to the German Government.   In all the circumstances, however I do not think it is unreason-   able to ask the German Government to take the risk in considera-   tion for the guarantee.     If the bonds are to be readily nego-   tlable in the guaranteeing countries it is obviously essential,   that their value In terms of  the national currency Should be   assured.   If, in addition to this, they are gold bonds (&quot;even though   the marginal gold value Is not guaranteed) they would have a certain   element of attractiveness (which would become considerable as German.   credit improves)  as investments in countries of which the exchange.   are not very stable.                                                        8.         less such, percentage,  If any,  as the Reparation Commission^        may  from time  to time decide can be met without creating         a deficit in the German budget.             The  bonds under paragraphs (i) and  (2) would be  identical    in every  respedt.  They would be expressed In gold marks  and  should    be payable by the agents of the German Government in the  Capital    of the recipient or guaranteeing Power in  the currency of that    Power,  at the option of the holder,  either at the rat e of exchange    ruling at the date  of issue (which should be stated on the bond)    or at that ruling at the date of payment .0&apos;               The liability of  the guarantors  however  should be limited    to payment in currency at the rate of exchange at the date of issue,    the holder to accept In the ev^nt of a German default  such payment    by the guarantor as a full dlsdhai*ge,  all  claims against  the  German    Government in respect of the defaulted bonds to pass to  the guaran-    tor.  If  instead  of claiming payment under  the guarantee, the holder    prefers to retain the defaulted bond as a  gold claim against  the    German Government he should be at liberty  to do  so, the  guarantee    thereupon lapsing.
        The bonds should bear interest at a rate high enough.,regard being had to the credit of the guaranteeing countries,  toenable them to be readily negotiated at par (say, 6 or even per cent.) .  They should have on their face a space for endorse-ment thereon of the guarantee of the recipient Government -   those under paragraph CD would be retained by the Governments concerned^and would be negotiable by them only under their respective guar-guarantees, those under paragraph (2) would be returned,  after  the endorsement thereon of the guarantee of the recipient Government,to the German Government, and would be negotiable by that Govern-ment *          In order to Increase the attractiveness of the bonds toinvestors it is for consideration whether the State Banks of therespective guaranteeing countries might not undertake at any time during the currency of the bonds to make advances against them upto (say) 80 per cent, of their guaranteed face value, receivingauthority, if necessary from their respective  Governments  to  treatthem as cover for their note issues.           Any country called upon to guarantee bonds under para-graph (2) should be given the option of retaining the bonds on pay-ment to the German Government of their face value in cash.           It should be announced that, provided that the German Goernment carry out the requirements of the Reparation Commission inregard to balancing the budget and reform of the finances of
Germany, similar arrangements will, to such extent as the Repar-atlon Commission may think them necessary, he made for the years1925 and 1925, and that, as soon as the position becomes sufficient-ly clear, and in any case not later than 1 July, 1926, theAllied Governments will consider the whole question of theaggregate liabilities of Germany under the Peace Treaty witha view to their permanent adjustment to her capacity of payment and to their liquidation by a series of foreign loans.         Subject to the above arrangemont-s,. the reparation--11abilities -of Germany from 1 January, 1923, would be governed by the schedule of Payments, under which the cash liability for each year is thedifference between the value of the deliveries  actually effectedand the full annuity liability-   This would have the result ofgiving an inducement to Germany to increase the deliveries in kind to the maximum possible figure, since the guaranteed bonds repbesent-ing the value of thed eliveries in kind would be placed at herdisposal, while those representing the cash liability would remain with Allied Powers.        From the point of view of the Treasuries of the Allied Powers,the plan has  the advantage of providing the same measure of budgetrelief as would have been derived from a complete execution ofthe Schedule of PayuieiJte provided they are prepared to guarantee,and to find a market fn^v, the German bonds*         No alternative policy seems likely to  secure anything  likeso satisfactory a financial result.         The policy of insisting on reparation  payments and deliveries in kind without regard to their effect on the budget has already made the continuance of payments in foreign currencies impossibleand jeopardized the deliveries.  To noontimie it will  soon makethe cessation of even the deliveries in kind inevitable and will
oroats conditions in which measures of coercion,  if applied,  willnot even cover their own cost-.          On the other hand,  the difficulties in which the Treasuriesof the Allied Powers find themselves by reason of the disappointment,,now Inevitable, of the extravagant hopes formerly enter baiaed inregard to the possibilities of reparation payments are very r ealdifficulties.   They will indeed be mitigated - not aggravated as .some seem Inclined to contend -- by a prudent handling of bad  anddoubtful assets and a recognition of the unwisdom of throwing goodmoney after bad;   but even so they will remain  serious,  and  just asit would be suicidal for the Allies too press their claims againstGermany to the breaking point of the letter, so it would be suicidalfor the creditor Allies to press interallied claims to the breakingpoint of the deb tor o          It is suggested therefore that in order to ease the generalsituation the Allied Governments should be invited to reconsider the existing interallied financial arrangements with a view tor-        (1)  The grant of indulgence in respect of interallied ffarindebtedness during-the- period up to the maturity of the last IssuedGerman guaranteed bonds,         (2)  The acceptance of the guaranteed bonds as betweenAllied Governments In lieu of cash for the purpose of adjustment of accounts,          (3)  The taking into account of any losses Incurred by theguaranteeing Governments by reason of their guarantee becomingoperative in the ultimate arrangements for dealing with inter-allied indebtedness-  which should be made at the same time asthe German liability is permanently adjusted.
*  Some elasticity may be desirable in applying this principle.   A fall i:\ pr..per mack prices if  it comes oefore the recent   catastrophic rise has become stereotyped would probably be   salutary rather than otherwise.                                                   12.     If the above plan commends  itself  to my colleagues,  I  urouldsuggest that the Comm.isB.ion should pass a resolution approvingit in principle subject to the observations of the GermanGovernment and the approval of the Allied Governments.     The approval of the Allied Governments is,  1  think,desirable before the plan is adopted because,  though morefavourable to them than a simple postponement for  five  yearsof the payments failing due in 1923 and 1924 (which would be within the competence of a majority decision of the ReparationCommission), it undoubtedly involves new elements, such as  theguarantee of the bonds by the Allied Governments,  whioh arenot contemplated by the Treaty of Versailles.     Its adoption should be made conditional on the GermanGovernment undertaking to impose by law upon the Reichsbankthe obligation to sell gold at a fixed  price - the figure tobe determined by a mixed Commission of  three,  one  member to beappointed by the German Government,  one by the ReparationCommission, and the third to be an American financial expertagreed by thecother two; the price,  once fixed,  to be incapable of increase,  but to be subject to diminution  on thedemand of the German Government with the approval  of theReparation Commipsron,     The figure should have regard to the internal purchasingpower of the max*k*, as determined by a  comparison  of averageGerman and American prices for staple commodities, at the time
 the  rate  is fiaed in order to avoid complicating the credit crisis which will certainly follow the introduction of the arrangement by a fresh disturbance of internal values.  Two or three weeks ago, a rate of 500 marks to the dollar would, I believe, have been suitable and practicable.  Now it may be necessary to go as high as 750 or even 1,000.  In a very few weeks&apos; time a very much higher rate will almost certainly be inevitable.     Although I think it desirable that the German. Govern- rnent should retain the po\?er,  subject to the approval of the Reparation Co^ission,  to lower the rate (i.e. to raise the exchange value of the mark),  if in future it is thought wise to do so,  it will probably be found that a new parity,  once established,  will be permanent.   It will be convenient, therefore, to select a mark-price for gold which will make the mark-dollar or mark-pound parity a round figure.     The new Reichsbank law should also make suitable pro-visions,  in accordance with recommendations to be made by theCommittee  above suggested,  for the control of the note issue by requiring any new expansion to be covered in suit-able proportions by gold or approved foreign currencies  and commercial bills.  It should also prohibit any further issues of legal tender money otherwise than by the Reichsbank.     Such an arrangement would give the best possible guarantee for the rehabilitation of the German budget position, since Germany would know that, unless the increase of the floating debt were arrested,  she would lose her gold reserve and with it the last barrier between herself and finalf inane ial  c ollapee .
      If further guarantees  on the part of Germany are thought to he necessary,  I. should see no serious objection to requiring the German Government  to agree to pledge specific State assets of a  suitable character to  the service of the guaranteed bonds and to invest the  Reparation Commission with powers of fore- closure in the event of default.  The problem of finding assets-suitable for pledging  will  obviously be greatly simplified if the mark can be stabilised.      I do not myself believe that such guarantees would really improve the security,  but they might have a certain politicalvalue, not only in the eyes of public opinion in allied countries, but ae  indicating to the German people that any failure on their part  to carry out the new arrangement willbe followed by drastic action.  I have never myself opposed the use of coercion to enforce obligations which Germany is really capable of carrying out - indeed,  in the last resortit is the only alternative - but from the point of view of therestoration of German  credit the fact of menaces of this character being regarded as necessary is an element of weak-ness  rather than of strength,  and unless the political advan-tages of indulging in  them are thought to outweigh the financialdisadvantages, I should prefer that recourse to them should be avoided.      I would further suggest that,  in the event of the adoptionof the new plan,  the Allied Governments should at the same timeconsider the question  of the desirability of reconstructingthe Reparation Commission and transferring it to Berlin,      The interests of  Germany and Germany5s creditors are, inray opinion,  on a long-sighted view,  identical.  Recent history
4.10.22.has, however, shewn pretty clearly that the ReparationCommission as at present constituted is too much disposed to sacrifice the interests of Germany, both present andfuture, and the ultimate interests of her creditors to theimmediate necessities of the latter, while the German Govern-ment tends to sacrifice the immediate interests of Germany!screditors and the ultimate interests of Germany herselfto the pressing financial exigencies of the moment.     If German sovereignty is to bre preserved - and unlessthe Reparation Commission is to undertake administrative responsibility for the government of Germany and be given  an army to support its authority, no other basis is possiblevery intimate co-operation between the German Governmentand the Commission is indispensable.
