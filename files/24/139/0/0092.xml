Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&apos;                  The annexed draft Report of the Committee on           Relative Rank of Officers of the Navy, Army and Air           Force was approved by the Chairman and the Naval           Member of the Committee,           2,     The Air Force and military members  dissented from           the Report as they desired the naval ranks of Captain           and Lieutenant should be divided into two  classes for           the purpose of determining tho position of naval officers           of those ranks in relation to officers of  the Army and           Air Force.           3.     It is possible that by that arrangement a more           equitable grading as between officers of the British           Army, Navy and Air Force can be insured;  but It leads           to complications and anomalies when British Naval officers           meet foreign naval and military officers;   and for that           reason It Is desirable that the practice should be           discontinued.           4.     I recommend that the rules contained in the           annexed draft Report of my Committee be approved.                                    (Intd)   S.B. u Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.

                      DRAFT^REPORT.1.   After careful consideration of the statements  preparedby the Admiralty,  War Office and Air Ministry dealing withthe Relative Rank of officers in the Three Services,  theCommittee have arrived at the conclusions enumerated  below:-2*    The flow and retardation of promotion due to  expansionsand reductions of establishments and other causes leads tovariation of the average age of officers in any rank  over aperiod, of years.   A comparison between the three services inthis respect can therefore be only approximately accurate;and it is Impossible to do more than fix the relative rankson a basis that Is roughly equitable.3..   It is desirable that relative rank should be determined ona system that is at once simple and not Inconveniently at variance with the practice of other nations for it  Is in relationto officers of foreign navies and armies that difficulties aremust likely to arise.4.   The practice of dividing the officers of a rank into two classes composed of those above and these below a certain numberof years service in that rank - for the purpose of determiningtheir relative rank with officers in the other services is unknownin most foreign navies and armies, and it is desirable for the sake of simplicity that it should be discontinued in the BritishServices..5.   It Is recommended that the relative rank of officers ofthe. Navy, Army and Air Force shall in the future be as shownin the following table:-
