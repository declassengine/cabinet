QABiwg  omiiTOnr ON TBH  AGRIQUITFPIUZ.  SITUATION.,  Memorandum by the Minister of Apiculture.     The Committee have considered the various- suggestions for the relief of Agriculture contained in the Memorandaof the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (0.Pa3788,CP, 4g61 and C.P0 4269) and also a Memorandum on thesubject by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.     The Committee also osasidered a Memorandum by theMinister of Health with reference to a proposal made tohim by the Minister of AglieAltUre to deal with the rating question by introducing a Bill next year embodying the &quot;Valuation and Bating proposals ef the CabinetCommittee, enacting that agricultural land should berated at ^ instead of   and providing a new exchequer grant of  5,000,000 to be paid into the local TaxationAccount and distributed in relief of rates generally.     The Committee came to the conclusion, however,that the objections which were advanced at the cabinet meeting against a  special grant from ihe Exchequer inrelief of agricultural rates applied also to additionalgrants from the &quot;exchequer in relief of rates generally,and they are  of  opinion that any reference by the PrimeMinister te the rating question in his reply to theagricultural  deputation should, be on the following lines      &quot;Farmers, like the rest of the community, have       felt the burden  of high rateSo      &quot;I am happy  to say that it appears that the rates       are at  last  falling, and I am Informed that in       about  three-quarters  of the areas in  the Country      -already a reduction is shown *   Signs are that the       fall will continue..      &quot;But, apart  from  this, a Commi.tt.ee of the Cabi.net       have for  some time been c ensicering a scheme  of       rating  reform which will include  an enlargment       of  the  present rating area-s sad &amp; unification  of       the whole  rating system  of  the country,      &quot;Incidentally this  simplification  would in itself       securo  material  economy and lead  to some reduction       of  the  rating burden.      &quot;The scheme  also  opens the way for. a revision  of      .the present  rating abatements accorded to farmers                          -i                           and
     and. others, and it would be possible in this way to     give-some further relief to agriculture without     imposing any appreciable increase of burden on other     ratepayers 0.    &quot;It is the intention of the-Government to press on with     this scheme of reform in eons$&amp;fea-tion with the     associations of Local Authorities&quot;D     Tho reference to the Committee excludes the possibilityof recommending a subsidy on arable land such as wassuggested by the Minister of Agriculture in his Memorandumof October 2nd (CP,^4261) in view of the similar claims which would be made by other industries, and the Committeehave proceeded, therefore, to consider certain other proposals, though they recognise that none of them willbe regarded by the agricultural community as adequate tothe needs ox the present situation.     The Committee believe, however, that useful assistancecan be given to Agriculture- in the two following directions,Viz,-     (l)  Loans to landowners for&apos;permanent improvements, and     (2)  Credit facilities to farmers for working capital.     At the present time most landowners cannot afford to sink capital in permanent improvements and the productivecapacity of their land is in conseqaonco seriously impaired,.Many farms require new buildings or the reconstruction ofexisting buildings, large areas of land are waterlogged and require draining and In other directions such as theprovision of water supply and road making, there is groatscope for improvements.     Under present financial conditions, capital forsuch purposes cannot be obtained except at rates whichcannot be recouped by an equivalent increase in rent andthe result is that the land is starved of capital and thenecessary equipment for obtaining the host possible output from the land is not being provided.   Prior to the war much
 f  this work  was  done  through tho  agency of  tho  Lands Improvement Gom- ,ny, a statutory Company,  under the  Chairmanship of Colonel Courthorpo sp5, which Is  empowered  to grant  loans, on tha  security of a first barge on  the land provided that the  Ministry of Agriculture certifiesthat tha annual valuo  of  the property will bo increased by an amount ot less  than the charge.   But in recent years,  owing to the high rateof  interest charged for the loans  (the current  rate, including sinkingfuhd, is about 7$) and also partly owing to  the  heavy charge made bythe Company for expenses,  tho business done  has  greatly diminished andthe total  amount  advanced in tha last four years 1918-21 has not ex-oeeded an  average of  12,278 a year.    It is suggested, therefore, thatfunds should  be made available by the Government from which advancesBight bs made to  landowners for permanent improvements.  Landownerswould thus benefit by the  difference  between the lower rate at which government funds  can be made available and tha  higher rate at whichfunds can  be  obtained in the open market.     There is a procodont for action  on theso linos in the public money Drainage Acts, 1846 to 1850, under which a sum of  5,200,000was voted  by  Parliament for advances  to landowners for land drainage  purposes.  The loans were made for periods not exceeding22  years  repayable hi  annual instalments of principal and interestcombined  at  the rate of 6%ffo and secured by a first charge ontho land.    The whole of this fund was taken up and repaid by1880  without  any loss to the State.   Dt  is  not expected that landowners at prosdnt wouldtake  advantage of such an  offer on a vory largo scale and thebenefit  to farmors would bo somewhat indiroct, but  the suraavailable  for  the purpose  could bo limited and tho  risk of ultimate loss would bo infinitesimal.   A proposal  of  this  kind would be  welcomed by all progressive landowners  and the nationwould gain by the increase  in. the productive capacity  of  the
       The other proposal which the Committee consider wellworthy of consideration is the prevision of Credit facilities to farmers for working capitalr       At the present time there is a serious danger that farmers may reduce wages below subsistence level and dispense with some of their5 labour altogether., because they are short of cash and cannot obtain credit to carry cn.    One result ofthis has been that they arc being compelled to force theirpro duo o cn an unwilling market with the consequence that pi-Ioeshave been unduly depressed against them.       Substantial relief would be given if farmers had thesame facilitiea for obtaining credit on ihe security of their personal character as they used to be able to obtain from theold private country Bankse   But there is general agreement that the same facilities  are not given by the large Joint. StockBanks controlled from London who will only grant leans or allowOverdrafts on collateral  security^       In the circumstances; the Minister of Agricultureproposed that as a temporary measure the State should guaranteeadvances made by the Banks on  the recommendation of theCounty Agricultural Committees and that an enquiry should be  seton foot as to the possibility  cf establishing a permanentCredit System on cO-operative  lines0   Mr. Hilton Young, onbehalf of the Chancellor  of the Exchequer, objected to any state guarantee to the Banks on the ground that it was undulyfavourable to the Banks and that so long as  it was in force therewould be no inducement to farmers to establish a co-operativescheme.       The Committee cannot but admit the force of the Treasuryobjections, and they have, therefore, considered the alternative proposal made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum of March last  that  if Agricultural Credit Banks were                                                established/
established on a co-operative basis he would be willingto give them temporary State assistance in the early stages/ possibly by placing at their disposal some of themonies raised by the sale of the National SavingsCertificates;       The Committee are impressed with the advantages of proceeding on such lines, &apos;but; ad there are a numberof technical and other questions which must be investigatedbefore a- scheme can be put into operation, they propose toappoint a small expert S\;.b-Committee consisting of SirTheodore Chambers. K.BoE*, and representatives of theTreasury, Ministry of Agriculture and Scottish Office with instructions to prepare a scheme which could be embodied ina. Bill to he introduced and passed in the Autumn Session.The Sub-Committee will be instructed to report not later than  November 4th, and  they will he asked to endeavour to frame a scheme which can be used not only to provide short-term  credit for farmers on personal security but also longterm  loans to landowners for permanent improvements onthe security of their land.       The Minister of Agriculture also called the attention-of the Committee to the special  case of those farmers whohad bought their farms  In reliance to a large extent on  theprospect of guaranteed prices for their com, and who nowfound the subsidies withdrawn, the value of their landdepreciated and their mortgages  insufficiently covered0
It was pointed out, however, by several members of theCommittee that it would be very difficult to justify state assistance to farmers who had made a bad speculation andalso that it was very doubtful if anything short of adirect grant could save such men.     The Committee came to the conclusion, therefore, thatthey could not recommend special State assistance in thesecases, but it would be open to the new owner occupiers toavail themselves of the proposed loans to landowners for permanent improvements and also to take advantage of anyCo-operative Credit schemes for the provision of working capital.     The Committee also considered the question of railway rates on agricultural produce and requisites and they are ofopinion that if the question Is raised by the agriculturaldeputation to the Prime Minister there would be no objectionto the promise of an enquiry into the existence of rates whichdifferentiated against home agriculture.,;     The Committee feel bound to point out, however, thatthe recommendations they have made cannot be regarded as muchmore than a friendly gesture on the part of the Government,-and. that thoy can have little or- no immediate effect in relieving the present situation,,     The truth is that in the present financial, conditionof the country there is nothing that this or any other government can do to bridge the difference between the cost of producing corn and potatoes this year and the prices they arerealising in the markets     It seems desirable, therefore, that the Deputation of farmers and labourers which is to wait on the Prime minister should be told definitely that the troubles from which theyare suffering are common, to most other Industries  at the                              .     -            /present
 present time, that they cannot he cured, hy the Government and that farmers must, therefore, adapt themselves to the economic position and manage their own business in -whatever wa is- most profitable to themselves.      The Government had to repeal tho Corn Production Acts owing to the cost being so much greater than was anticipated and consequently  they cannot arid do not expect farmers to farm their land, in a manner which, will involve them in lo-ssc Agriculturists must, therefore, make up their minds to face their difficulties without Government Interference and without expecting the Government to  subsidise thenu      At the same  time,  they might be reminded of the considerable amount of.assistance they have received from the Government, hot -only by the corn subsidy of  18,000,-000 lastyear, but also&apos; by  the greatly increased, provision of funds for agricultural  education and research  the assistance of drainage schemes  in relief of unemployment and trie expenditureof nearly  1,000,000 In eradicating foot-and-mouth disease     If the Cabinet is in accord with the views and recommendations set out in this Report, the Minister ofAgriculture, will prepare a brief oh these lines for the use of the Prime Minister in&quot;replying to the agricultural deputation,                               (Intel.- )  A a Go Beftiitehall  Gardens,  S,W.
