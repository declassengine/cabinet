BIS  DOClBaEHT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  Off HIS BRITAJliilG-JaA^E^^C R E To0 A B I E E 0?.,- 4278.,80I.P. 39)HOUSING.Memorandum by the Mlnietey of Health.1.At their meeting on the  8th August the Oommitteeon Trade Policy had under consideration a memorandum (0.P*4155)in which, with the object of securing the building of 80,000houses during the next two years, I proposed that the Governmentshould offer local authorities a contribution averaging  3 a house towards the annual loss on houses erected with theGove rnment Approval.     The Committee felt that the adoption of a new scheme ofState assistance for housing would involve considerable diffi-culties and they desired that certain proposals made by Mr,,Alhan Richards for facilitating  building by Industrial concernsshould be examined and that the  possibilities of inducinglocal authorities to carry out fresh housing schemes by using the opportunities given by the revised Trade Facilities scheme should he considered.     2.   Mr, Alban Richards&apos; scheme proposes that the Govern-ment should lend 75 per cent of  the cost of building houses at less than the market rate, and should guarantee the interest andredemption of the remaining 25 per cent.  This means that theGovernment is not only to pay a  subsidy but in the last resortis to bear the entire risk of the venture.  Mr. Richards statesthat various industrial concerns are prepared to bear a certain measure of loss, but he asks for Government assistance in meeting the less beyond this amount.  It would appear that Mr.Richards has over-estimated the  cost of houses and some of the out-goings and that if the industrial concerns are prepared tobe ar
such loss as he says no subsidy to. them should be necessary.Ih fact, one of the industrial concerns; in whose housing scheme Mr. hiohards was interested, has agreed to proceed witha housing scheme without any subsidy but with part of thecapital required being guaranteed under the Trade -FacilitiesScheme.     It may be mentioned that the terms for which Mr. Richardsasks are much more favourable than the non-subsidy scheme beingcarried out under the control of Sir Tudor Walters for certainlarge colliery companies.     In these circumstances I cannot recommend action on thelines proposed by Mr. Mchards.     3.  . The essential. features of the Trade Jfaoilitieo Scheme,as hovv proposed to be amended, which would affect local author-it less&apos; housing proposals, are (a) the raising of capita?, witha Government guarantee, and (b J the payment by the Governmentof the whole or part of the interest charges during the first three years.  In the case of local authorities a government guarantee will as a rule be unnecessary and will confer no benefit.   The larger local authorities can raise without difficulty all the loans they need on terms at least as good asthey could secure under a guarantee and in many cases would much prefer to make their own financial arrangements,,  Thesmaller local authorities can normally borrow from the local loans iPund and there seems to be no advantage in providing analternative method of borrowing with Government guarantee *In ,fact, the Government guarantee would only be attractive tothe. very few local authorities who, on account of abnormallyhigh rates or for other causes, experience difficult in raisingcapital and who are normally debarred from access to the local loans fund, and machinery for dealing with these cases already exists.                                                   As
      is to the other element of the Trade facilities scheme,the contribution by the Govern man t. of a whole or part of theinterest for a period of three years, it may be observed thata payment of the whole of the interest1 for three years ispractically equivalent in present value to the grant of  3 ayear for 60 years which was. suggested in- my .original proposal.On present prices the annual interest -on the capital :cost of a house is very considerably in excess, of the probable annual loss and it would be necessary to require that some part of thegrant should, be canied to capital account.  With this require-ment it is clear that the alternative, suggested :would not bemore attractive to local authorities than my previous proposal,vhile for a scheme of 80,000 houses it would involve an annualcharge of  1,800,000 for three years as compared with a maximum of  240,000 per annum-for the currency of the loan under my proposal.     It will be seen, therefore, that.applied to the general programme of 80,000 - additional houses which I contemplated, theTrade Facilities Scheme at its best has no special advantagesover my proposal and is not attractive to the local authoritieswhile it would involve an additional immediate charge on thetaxpayers of the next three years of a million and a half, aburdenwhich, in my view,  it would be inequitable to impose.For. purposes of comparison I have assumed that the Trade -Facilities Scheme is applicable to a two year programme andthat as a matter of course full interest would be remitted forthree years.  I doubt, however, whether the Trade FacilitiesSchemej which is designed to relieve present unemployment,could, properly be applied to a future programme of this kind.I presume&apos; further that the intention is in practice to limit the remission of interest to undertakings having a considerableInitial unreal une rat ive period and, in order to deal equitablywith different classes of schemes, to restrict the period durin                                                 which
which interest would be excused to the un remunerative period,which in the case of housing would not generally. exceed 9 months,,Further, the Trade facilities  scheme seems better suited to large undertakings than to a considerable number of small build-lag schemes scattered all over the country. .On these variousgrounds, I come to the conclusion the Trade facilities Scheme isnot appropriate for Government housing.     4.  There is another possible alternative course which Ihave considered.  bo far housing has been excluded from .theschemes of local authorities subsidised through the St. DavidsCommittee on the ground that Government assistance for it hasbeen provided in other ways.  If no new housing scheme under.direct subsidy is to be adopted, it would be possible to allowhousing to rank for assistance as an unemployment scheme andthe appropriate measure of assistance would be that given to revenue producing schemes, i,.e. 50 pet.cent of interest charges for- five years.  If such a policy were adopted, I should haveto Insist thai- this part of the general unemployment reliefshould be administered direct from this Ministry and not by the st. Davids1 Committee, so as to secure that what is done isdovetailed into what has already been done, so as to avoidplacing excessive forward contracts, and so as to ensure, that new work is properly proportioned to available labour in thedifferent branches of the building trade.     The primary object of the unemployment relief schemes being to provide work-next winter, I  should have to assign a period of,say, six or seven months for the currency of the housing part ofthe scheme, and  I suppose that  I. might obtain say six. or seventhousand new houses,.  This would mean an addition of say, threemillions to the ten millions at present laid down as the capital cost limit for Unemployment lie lief Works and an additionalannual charge to the Exchequer  of, say,  75,000 per annum for five years.  These figures are  of the most provisional character                                                 because
&quot;because I cannot form a judgment- as to the extent to which. Jbocal...^authorities would adopt the scheme.     5.  This scheme, if adopted,  would tide us over the winter and would be a further step in the process of getting away fromthe unsound scheme embodied in the legislation of 1919,  Person-ally,  I do not recommend it.  It is simply a hand to mouthpolicy and will do little or nothing to mitigate the pressure onus to  state what the Government really means to do with thehousing question.  As soon as this temporary scheme is worked&apos;out next Spring that pressure mill become irresistible.  My own view is that,  to say nothing on the merits,  it is a mistake onthe narrowest ground of political expediency to leave our policyin suspense, and it will do us great harm in the constituencies,I admit freely that we can at present initiate no policy for along period of time because of the many uncertain factors suchas the duration of the Lent Restriction Act, but I consider thata definite- housing policy which can be stated and defended assuch is urgently required and accordingly I&apos;press a furtherconsideration of the limited programme providing for the con-struction of 80.000 houses in a period of two years on certain conditions of assistance from the State which were laid downin my  previous memorandum on the subject.     6.   I would observe that since the date of that memorandum I have received full particulars from local authorities of thepresent position ef&quot; ; their scshemes and of the financial arrange -ments  made by them, and I have given further consideration tothe housing provision required on ray estimates for 1923/24.  Ifind that the completion of the schemes has been longer delayedthan I anticipated and therefore that the borrowings of theauthorities at the lower rates of interest which have prevailedthis year have been considerably larger than I expected.  the resulting saving is now estimated as between  300,000 and 350,000 per annum instead, of the  150, 000 per annum, stated inmy previous memorandum.  It follows, that if I can. induce local                                                   authorit ies
autKb.oxlt.les to build, up -to- -80,-000 Jiouaea. .in tw years..on.....thebasis of an average grant of  3 a house, I shall be able toprovide this money by means of savings on the provision, for housing on this year&apos;s estimates and to leave a balance ofabout  100,000 a year.  If in the course of negotiations withthe local authorities I find it necessary to increase the  3,I should reduce the number of houses se as not to exceed thefinancial authority,  During the financial year 1923/84 I could.not expect charges in respect of anything like the full 80,000houses to come on the estimates, and I do not think I should require to provide more than  75,000 in that year in respect ofthose additional houses.  It seems to me that if I can providethe money for a strictly temporary scheme (with every conceiv-able safeguard against extravagant expenditure) and can evenmade a material saving on the provision on this years estimates,and If the government can point out that their housing policy will produce with the houses already in construction,  a totalof about 300,000 houses, they will be in a strong position fromthe point of view of constructive policy and they will also have every justification for declining to proceed any further with housing subsidies when this scheme is worked out.     J^orty thousand houses a year Is roughly the normal pre-warbuilding of this class of house jiroperty.  I could arrange theprogramme so as not to allow prices to rise again against theauthorities; with a larger number it would be difficult tocarry out the programme in the time and not to recreate ashortage of labour and materials.     As I pointed out in my previous memorandum, the scheme will necessitate amendment of the Housing Acts,  which can besecured by a provision in the Economy Bill,                                 A.
