Particulars are given of the various contingents  who  havealready begun to march to London in accordance with  the schemedrawn up by the National Administrative Council of the  NationalUnemployed Workers1 Committee Movement,     The Communist Party will support the Labour Party at  thegeneral election as a step towards &quot;the revolutionary conquestof power&quot;.     The Communist party is equipped with funds sufficientat least  for  the candidature cot Walton Nevvbould in Motherwelland G&amp;llucher  in Dundee.     Several communist candidates stood under  labour auspices&quot;cr the municipal elections.     Some progress is  being made with the re-organisation of the oiamunist Party and the Young Communist League on the lines of he Moscow  Theses.     The  experiences of an English  communist in  Russia indicate tj-at communists  are rigorously treated  there unless they carry hicial  credentials.

They ;          have attacked you with every weapon at their command. f               &quot;They have battered down your wages to starvation          levels.               &quot;They have oast you on the scrap-heap of          unemployment In millions.               &quot;They have gagged your every protest, bludgeoned          you when you assembled to demonstrate your misery,          and laid by the heels in prison all those bold enough          to vfcioe your claims and your indignation.               &quot;Now they wish to complete their victory by          calling on you to register your submission at the          ballot box.  They call on you to agree to their power          for another five years, in order that they may cover          the future tyrannies they have in store with the          appearance of your consent.               &quot;Working men and womenl  To hell with their          capitalist politics! ...               &quot;Shy should we take part in the election?  Not          &quot;because we believe our struggle will be fought in ths          enemy1 a platform of parliament.  Not beoanse we belieye          fine speeches will persuade the ruling class t*      &apos;&apos;          surrender.  NoJ  the struggle of the workers will be          fought ont in the streets and in the workshops.               &quot;But we send working-olass candidates to Parliament          in order that the many millions of workers who still          believe in It may see the truth of It in practice and          learn its futility for the working-class struggle.  We          make the elections a rallying cry for the workers to          measure their strength against the capitalists.  The          demonstration of to-day beoemes the cpen struggle of          to-morrow.               &quot;All over the world the struggle iB raging.   The          workers of Europe, the peasants and masses of India apd          the subject nations, have been in open revolt.  But          always the embattled power of reaction from its citadel          here in Britain taas held them in and prevented the          victory of the working-class.  It rests with us to make an          end of this.  The workers of the world, the subjected          masses of every country, are looking to the British          working class to assert itself.  We must not fail them.               &quot;Every blow struck at the Capitalist domination here          is a blow struck for the workers1 struggle all over the          world,  let UB by the demonstration of our strength and                                                           our/
2842        our unity in this  election  send  out a message  of hope to        the hard  pressed and heroic workers of Russia,  of Germany,        of Ireland,  of India,  and every  other country,  that they%      may go  forward in  their  difficult battle with  renewed        faith and determination, confident in the sure  knowledge        that we shall soon he  with  them.             &quot;To  demonstrate our strength and our unity we must        stand together.  We must present a united front of the        working class.  No worker must stand against a  vs/orker to        the advantage of the capitalists.  We must  stpport our        own candidates,  chosen hy the workers&quot; own  organisations,        against the  capitalist oandiaates.  Support all working-        olass candidates.             &quot;We  communists are  the revolutionary left  wing of        the working-class  movement, united in a party  to give        independent  expression to the revolutionary policy of the        working-class; hut fighting with the rest of the working        olass in  every struggle. For the elections we  stand        shoulder  to  shoulder with the other candidates  of the        working-class.             &quot;Workers of Motherwell and  Dundee, support the        ceommunist candidates...   Our candidates are tried and        true fighters in the revolutionary struggle...             &quot;Workers of the other  constituencies,  support the        Labour  Party candidates...             &quot;Because we are convinced that by the  struggle against        capitalism they will be  compelled to adopt  the  policy of        the Communist Party sooner  or later or perish,  we decline        to put  opposition  candidates against the Labour Party        candidates where these are  already fighting.   Labour oannot        afford  to present  a broken  front to the enemy  in the crisis        to-day...             &quot;Pledge your  candidates against any form  of alliance        of understanding with  any capitalist party.             &quot;Pledge them  to vote- against all war credits.             &quot;Pledge them  to support the unemployed demands and to        fight for them.             &quot;Pledge them  to oppose every expenditure  of the        Government which serves  to  organise repression  of the        workers - army,  nav3,  or police.             &quot;Pledge them  to maintain the interests of  the workers&apos;        organisations, and to  resist every attack upon  the liberty        of organisation, of speech, of meeting, or  of  strikes.             &quot;Pledge them  to oppose every form of Government        intervention against the workers or supporting  of        organisations hostile  to the workers.             &quot;Fellow workers,  the struggle at the election is only        a beginning.  The  real struggle  comes after.   Only the        revolutionary conquest of power  can achieve our aims.  But        in the  meantime, let U3  mass our forces In  unity in the        present struggle and he  prepared for the struggles of the        future.             &quot;Down with Capitalist misruleX&quot;All Power to the Working ClassI &quot;The/
     The Communist Party has decided to issue a daily paperfrom November 8th to November 15bh because  &quot;now that theGeneral Election is on, the character- of our political and propaganda activity must be shaped to bring the CommunistParty to the front, and hasten the coming to power of aWorkers1 Government.  There are many ways of bringing thepolicy  of the Communist Party before the working classbesides running candidates.  Every communist is aware of thapower of the Press.&quot;     It is reliably reported that the withdrawal of most ofthe official Communist Party candidates some weeks ago was a move to protect Mother-well and Dundee, whioh are beingcontested by Walton Newbold and Gallaober respectively:  itis further suggested that the Labour Party agreed not to putforward candidates in these two constituencies.     Branches have been uxgsa to make e-jery possible effort tcsupport the coacmorii st Election, pcnd of  1, COO:  this procedure is in accordance with the recommendation of the partyCommission th&amp;tWinters should always give financial support,but a leading official said to one of my correspondents lastweek, &quot;We have an election fund and can meet all demands madeon that fund.&quot;  In. this connection it may be mentioned thatInkpin informed Robert Stewart on October 30th that he was&quot;arranging to send Inches a cheque for a further  100to-morrow.  This, together with the  100 he has already hadand the  300 set aside for the two Returning Officers&apos;Deposits,, will make up the minimum  500 guaranteed for thetwo consticuonoieD&apos;7-  (inches is acting as trustee for thefinance c cmnritto e ) ?

     The Executive has decided that  &quot;the salaries of agents and candidates will&apos;he  5 per week&quot;:.  James Gardner, ofGlasgow, ia to be Gi.:-.llaoher*s agent  in Dundee.  The Executiveis greatly annoyed because E.H. Brown, the Worth Easterndivisional organiser, declined an offer to act as electionagent for the Labour Party at Shipley:  Bell has advisedBrown to make the best of a bad job  and &quot;get all our points in the questionnaire adopted and, as far as possible, influencehis election aldress in accordance with the points in the questionnaire and manifesto.  If you can get; him to mentionour pledges In his address it would be very useful for us.On the whole we advise that you give the most generous help,always with the objective in view of bringing the party well tothe fx onto&quot;     According to the ?;&apos;Ds 11.T Herald&quot;, Philips Price, who isthe paper a Berlin correspondent and an actual, if not a nominal communist, has been adopted  as candidate by theGloucester Trades Cornell and Labour Party and returns to  &apos;England this week,     Alec.

I do hope  it does not come  off till April next when I hope to be with  yon.  Copies of the circular letter on your behalf will  be sent to you next week.  I have told Las (President- elect of the National  Congress) about your candidature and he says he will do all he can to support it financially.&quot;      Mrs. Lespard has  sent Saklatvsla from Ireland an &quot;appeal to the electors of Battersea&quot; and states that she is. willing to come over and support him if necessary.      Although the municipal elections have been held, interest attaches to a circular issued recently by Cant onbehalf of the London Listriot Council of the CommunistParty of Great Britain, as it shows the extent; to&apos;which theCommunist Party has permeated Labour organisations inLondon:     &quot;To the  Branches,  Party Candidates and Speakers.                     &quot;Re  TBS MCinCIPAL ELECTIONS ,.          &quot;Herewith I am sending you a list of the Party     members  who are candidates in the Municipal Elections     whioh will take place  on &quot;Wednesday,  November 1st.          &quot;The adoption of these  members as candidates     by  the local  Labour Parties  is a tribute  to thei ,     confidence which the  rank and  file  of the Labour     Movement have  in us.

In the case  of  comrades  Wall and Higgins,  it is not         a case here  of  going  against Party policy.  They are         commtinists seats, held by our comrades,  and it is         the Labour Party who  are interlopers,  not the CP.         The onus  of  splitting the ranks falls upon the         Labour Party, not ourselves.nThose marked  x  have been elected.     Despite their unpopularity in some  branches, therecommendations of the Commission for the re-organisation ofthe Party are being put  in force:   last  week,  for instance,the following c6mmunication was sent  by  Inkpin, the national-                                                      organising/

If so, who is active in what?  Yvhat kind of work          do they do, and is it organised and directed by          the branch or divisional organiser, or left to          the judgment of tho individual member?

The Communist party has in hand the publication of another Issue of the &quot;Communist International&quot; but owing tothe absence of Patrick Lavin, the editorial work and thepublications are being dene in London instead of in Scotlandwhere it is thought that good use can be made of the SecretPress for election purposes.

Iff TEENATIONAL COMMUNIST COMBBREHCB          On October 27th Wijnkoop, the President of the     Communistische Partij in Nederlanci, sent the following     suggestions to Tom Bell, who was recently expelled from     Prance:  chey relate to the suggested conference of members     of Continental Communist Party executives to which reference     was made in report No. 176:               &quot;It was a pity we could not see one another after          tho Yfednesday night that you spoke in Paris.  Still          the affair must, to our opinion which is as far as I          know also yours and that of McManus and of our respective          parties, be continued the more so as I have the written          statement that the Germans and Italios parties agree to          it, and that we know that Belgium and Scandinavia will          not stand apartB   Now we think the best.thing to do at          the moment is that the English section instead of the          Fronch which lives in this moment in a sort of gachis          as you know, takes the initiative for a small          conference as soon as possible in Brussels.  November          is soon at hands and in November the International          Conference on the Eastern Question, which will bring the          war danger again in the foreground and certainly the          acute conflict between England and Prance, and also that          insipid the Hague Peace Conference of the Amsterdam          International will take place*  So to our opinion it is          time for us to mix in openly by manifesto and if          necessary and possible by a kind of international          demon strati ve action in Westuirn Europe to begin with.          So we of the C.PJ&apos;. suggest that you call together as          soon as possible a small conference in Brussels of one          delegate of each of the Parties of England, France,          Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Italy,          liixembourg and Scandinavia and perhaps Ireland.  If you          want us to arrange a locality in Brussels somewhere -          because we are needed to Br. than you - welIl be          pleased to do it, but then be so kind to let us know          as soon as possible what would be the best date for you.          As soon as we have arranged the locality you can send          the letters to ask the delegates.  We do believe that          it is necessary and that it grows mere necessary every          day.&quot;

The structure committee has been specially     allotted the task of applying the new scheme and branches     are requested to await instructions from this committee     before attempting to put into operation the scheme of     re-organisation.&quot;     The League is also re-organising its press on thefollowing line s:-          &quot;In the past the Communist Press has been the happy     hunting ground for the professors and their theories     upon the materialist conception of history, relative     theory of values,  etc.   The columns have been taken b     up by high-brow debates between the big guns upon high     politics and lobby gas.                                                     &quot;This/
- 11651           &quot;This  conception  of a  league  Organ  has  got  to  cease.      These high-brow articles  on  political, economy have now  to.      give  way to articles and  reports upon the  actual conditions,.      prevailing  in the  mill, mino  and factory.                  \           &quot;The papers are not  only to be  read by  the  working      youth, but  also are to be written  by them-.   This necessarily      means that  all the old methods of  journalism which  have been      used  in  the past have  got to  be scrapped,  Every young      communist has got  to make himself  or herself a correspondent      to  the League organs.  What ws have  got  to have  is  the actual      experiences of the young  worker in his or  her particular      industry.           &quot;With  that object in view, the  executive committee      instruct all branches  to elect one comrade to act as corres-^      correspondent  for the &quot;^young CommunistT.           &quot;The duty of  this correspondent will  be  to  see that each      member writes reports  of his  or her  working  conditions.  These      reports  should contain the  hours worked  by the youth,  wages&apos;      paid, whether there are any young  workers  doing  adults11      labour whilst receiving youth wagos,  in  what  way the foreman      treats the  young workers, instances  of brutality, forcible V&apos;      night work,  participation in  dangerous occupations.  The      fullest  details of all grievances  of this  character should be      given.   They should bo embodied In letters written  by  the      comrades concerned in  these experiences.   Ho  details,  no matter      how trivial,  should be omitted.           &quot;The elected  correspondent must send  into us all  the      letters  received by him from  the various comrades,  these      must,  not be  altered in any  way whatsoever.

THE BED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR HIT IONS          The last of the district conferences of the Red     International of Labour Unions was held at Cardiff on     October 2ist and was attended by some fifty delegates:     A.J. Cook stated that instructions were being prepared for     the expulsion from the Miners1 Federation of Great Britain     of all officials who favoured the Red International of     Labour Unions but that the movement for affiliation had     grown so rapidly that he doubted whether an attempt would     be made to give effect to the instructions.          Voluminous reports of this conference and of those    -held in Glasgow, Birmingham,  Newcastle and Sheffield     have, been sent to the Berlin Bureau of the Red Inter-     national of Labour Unions for transmission to Moscow.          It is reported that the  Brofitern has an Inner     Council of twelve members, representing Great Britain,     France, Germany, Holland, Norway, Italy, Bulgaria, Jugo-     Slavia, Japan and Rus-sias  J.T. Murphy is the British     representative on this Inner Council and, with Tomsky     and Rosmer, functions as a supervisory sub-committee.          There is reason to believe that Nat Watkins, who is     one of the delegates to the Red International of Labour-     Unions Congress in Moscow, is again travelling on the     Continent disguised as a clergyman.          Tom Mann informed Nat V/atkins on October 11th that     he had been in Cape Town and  was going on to Elmberley and     Johannesburg:  on October 10th he attended a Trade Union     Congress which resolved that  basic changes must be mace in     the Trade.Union movement in south Africa and a national     conference called.  On the same day a Johannesburg     communist named Dxuibar informed Sylvia pankhurst that     &quot;Tom Mann has started well.  He told his hearers (at the                                                    Cape )/

The percentage of known communists         in the contingents is small but extreme elements in London         aro reported to be working out a scheme for &quot;an attack on         London&quot; when the marchers arrive:  the idea is for some of         the men to carry sticks,  lead piping and electric cable:  the         men primarily responsible for this scheme appear to be         Crawley, Wiltshire and Poster.

QIGANISED UNEMPLOYED AND TB&apos;:&apos; ELECTIONS          Although it has been covered previously, it may be of     Interest to include in this report the manifesto Issued by     the National Unemployed workers&apos; Committee Movement in     connection with Municipal, Guardians and Parliamentary     elections:  the questionnaire is believed to have been signed     by several labour candidates.               &quot;The Unemployed have now an organisation built          up on lines which denote, and give practical evidence          of, an increasing SOLIDARITY.   In practically every          town of industrial pretensions there is an organisation,          which, upon examination, will not only compel immediate          attention but careful consideration by those whose          object it may be to seek to represent the MASSES in the          capacity indicated at the commencement.          OUR CAUSE              &quot;Is the cause of the bottom-dog, of those who have          never had a chance,  of. the disillusioned ex-service man,          the worsen whose babes are crying for nilk, of the girls          who are being driven on to the streets as the only          alternative,  and of All who are suffering as a result          of the policy of rate-cutting or wage reductions and          increased hours of labour.

The  account of his experiences sent by Jackson to his     wife Is as follows:-               &quot;You will think I am dead or lost.   But I have          been detained for identification.  They are very strict.          There has been so many rascals in this country that the          methods they adopt to safeguard the Republic are very          severe  Indeed.  It does not  matter who comes along, they          must be Identified by responsible comrades.               &quot;Bill Haywood identified me and the English          delegate  to the Vjorld^ Congress will be here to-morrow,          and  then  I am alright.               &quot;By  the time  you get this letter I shall be working                                                        in/
in the Comintern for the Congress.  I shall he in charge ofthe Printing Shop (English section) ana I have been promiseda room in the Hotel LHS.  She same place as Bill Haywood.  Ihave no rant to pay one hundred and fifty million per month and nearly all my food.  The amount seems enormous hut it isnot very much.  You see when you get here you will get foodjust as I do and so will the children and just as much as Ido.  So you will see it is important you get ready to come over here and we shall he a lot hatter off.     &quot;In my next letter I will he able to tell you more.There: is a lot of English in the Hotel Lux.  So you willbe able to speak with the neighbours.     &quot;The black bread is very sustaining.  How the folksgot along here in 19&amp;Q and 1921 I don&apos;t know.  1/8 lb.black bread per day.  Fighting the Allies and their pimps;And the spirit of&quot;&quot;the soldiers must have been unbreakable.I do admire them.     &quot;The Red Army are a fine body of men, and God keepanyone who comes here to fight.  They would go through anine foot wall.     &quot;There is plenty of food here and in the cities.  Thefruit stores look lovely.     &quot;How is.the Hull branch getting along?  Do they holdany meetings?  Who sells the literature?  How listen thisis important.  Before the Boys come here tell them theymust get their cards stamped from Headquarters with theParty soal.  Also a note or letter. If not they will be detained.     &quot;I shall get my Communist Book next week and thenEveryone recognises youc  They don&apos;t believe anyone unlessyou have a book and it&quot;s bad luck to the member who goesoack on the movement.     &quot;They know all about the Beeches here.  I told them Iwas the one who stopped him.  They dare not come here.  Theywould be a head shorter in no time.  They will be markedwherever they go and don&apos;t forget.  It is through suchscoundrels as thorn that the Soviets have to be so strict.     &quot;There is to be 16&apos;ice breakers in the Baltic Sea this winter, and I will try and get you all over before this year&apos;s  out.  If not in the early spring.     &quot;I had to be identified up to the hilt first-  I wanted to be sent back to Petrograd,  but they asked me to stay herein Moscow for the conference.  It starts in a couple of weeks.  They promised me (after Bill HaywocK^s recommendation as to my ability as a printer)  I should be in charge or asthey say superintend the whole of the Bnglish printing denefor England and America, Australia, New Zealand and towherever the language is spoken.  You see the speeches and reports have to be published in all languages.  So I saidI would obey orders from the Party.  that&apos;s called Partydiscipline.                                                   &quot;The/
            &quot;The Comintern is the building where all the political       activities of the Party is carried on.  It is a large     -&quot;building.  There is tho English ana American section, German  %   v &quot;anfl Bus si an,  in fact every nationality is represented here.            &quot;Another word about my identification.  If England had       had a permanent representative here I would have been working       now.  But it  is just like England they move very slowly.            &quot;If the  boys decide to come when I am settled they can       come the same way as I did.  But they should give the comrades       about lo/- apiece for their grup.  You see the Sailors and       Firemen buy their own food and you will see they (the boys)       should give something towards their food.  I don&apos;t know as       they would take it, anyhow 30/- for the three of them or if       Stanley waits for you to come it would be  1.  If they will  ;:       not take money then you buy some food and take it with you       for the trip.            &quot;More about this later.&quot;JTICTIOH       The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs ma that on OctoberI  26th the communist John Trotter was fined 20s for using abusive  languago to Police Officers, which was calculatea to cause a  breach of the peace.EE EVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN      As far as th* open Irish movement is concerned there  is very little to report.  The Irish Se If-Le termination League is  dying fast, although a few branches are holding on for the November Conference:  one of the most prosperous Metropolitan branches,j Lewisham, is turning Itself into a Social Club.      Extremists are abandoning the name &quot;Sinn Fein&quot; and calling&quot; themselves &quot;Republican Clubs&quot;..  Generally speaking the Irish in Great Britain are tired of Republicanism and are devoting  their attention to local matters.  In London, Liverpool and the  greatI Irish centres of the North, they ran quite a number of Irish-I Catholic candidates for the Borough Elections.  As far as  the General Election goes it is most probable that the bulk  of theI Irish Catholic vote will go to Labour, in spite of the trouble  in                                                     Liverpool/
                         -  SI - Liverpool, whore  Irish  candidates  are &quot;being opposed; by Labour men for  the  City Council.      The MoSwiney Commemoration meeting  at  the Essex   Hall, Strand, passed  off  quietly on October 25th:  about 700 supporters filled the hall and about 400 others were unablo to  gain admission:  the  speakers were CB. Button, Miss Mary MoSwiney, Miss Connolly (Mrs. Sadie1c sister) and Mr. 0&apos;Donoghue:  Art 0&apos;Brien noted as  Chairman.       the     All/speakers, who were  well received, encouraged  those present to continue their  allegiance to  the  Irish Republic as  it was only by such support that the  hopes of the Irish prople could be fulfilled.   Miss McSwiney said they were to clo  all that Is possible  against the English, and that  they intend to cause trouble  in every part of the world.     Art 0TBrIen;  who professes to be highly pleased at the result of the  meeting,  says he is afraid there will be a good deal of trouble in the next three or four months and there will be still more in prison here:   they appear to fear that many of  them will be deported to Ireland and  they do not like  the idea at all.      The Glasgow  Police raided  B&amp;nba Hall on Friday last (October S7th)  and  seized  some  arms,  etc.,  belonging to thelocal Irish Republican Army.  Six men were arrested.
