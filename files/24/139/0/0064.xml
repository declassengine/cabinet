On September 27th&quot;the secretary of the Communist Party v.   ssent to numerous &quot;selected&quot; communists a circular from which     the following extracts are taken:               &quot;Wo have received from the Central Executive       .

The replies then          received will be collected and transmitted to Moscow.&quot;          She questionnaire enclosed with this document contained     47 questions regarding &quot;the tactic  of the United Front&quot;; v   every conceivable detail of a matter which Moscow has already     worn almost threadbare were covered:  the object is probably    ;to obtain new ideas for yet; another &quot;tactic&quot; against labour     leaders.          A meeting of the full executive of the Communist Party is     to be held at King Street on October 6th in preparation for     the national conference on the two following days:  copies of     the full agenda for the latter meeting,&apos;also of the printed re-&apos;     port of the party Commission are in the possession of-&apos;this de-     partment and will be dealt with afters the conference   Special     significance would appear. ,to-4atil^^^*oathevifaliJt that the pro-     gramme of the British ^arty 1$ to he -settled in Moscow and not     in london.

On the  following day all branch secre taries were informed  that their  Executive was in &quot;hearty agrei&apos;, ment&quot; with  the Second International and  unreservedly responded to the call to use  &quot;every ounce  of strength, political and industrial  to avert war&quot;:  the circular  suggested the &quot;imraedi... atQ:I summoning&quot; of Councils of  Action and a World Congress of all working class organisations.    The programme laid down foi the Councils of Action was:     &quot;She immediate withdrawal of the British troops to     ths .Europeen side of the Straits, so as to: avoid any     conflict with  the Turkish National  forces on what     is their rightful national  territory.     &quot;She summoning,,  without further delay and without &apos;     further conditions,  of&quot;an international conference,  in     which  the Government of Ruseaa.  Gt^Treny,, and the Black     Sea States shall be&apos;&apos; invited  to participate to settle     the disposition  of the  territory of the, former Turkish     Empire, and to  determine l&amp;te  regime  of the Straits.     &quot;To demand an  tmequivocal declaration by the British     Government acknowledging the full right.of the Turkish     people, to self &quot;determination and independence.     &quot;2o demand of  the labour party and  General Council of     Trade  Unions the immediate  summoning of the National     Council of Action- to take any and  every step that     may be  necessary to  enforce  the above  demands upon the     British Government,11     Communists were,  also instructed that,  in the event of war, they were on ne account to take up a hostile attitude, or one of pacifism, but to carry on propaganda  In the AMny and if necessary,  fire in  the air.     Ther* has been some  propaganda in favour of obstructing the transport of troops and  of war material,  but the result has, so far, heen negligible.     Ike Industrial Committee of  the  Communist Party has issued proposals for.  the  reorganisation&apos; of Trades and Labour Councils, with reference, more particularly,  to the  national oonfersnce in Birmingham  on  October 14th.

It  is  reported,  on the authority of a reliable informant     that the Communist Party of Great Britain recently sent to the     secretary of the  Workers1 Council in Dublin, a  cheque for      500 to  help in tho postal  strike.SHE YOUHG COMMUNIST LEAGUE          Some weeks ago the Executive of the Young  Communist     International sent to the Young Communist League of Great     Britain  a &quot;Questionnaire on the Realization  of  the Decisions     of the Second Congress of the  Young Communist International     in the Young Communist Leagues&quot;,  in preparation for the Third     Congress in November.

The Chief Constable, of  greenock informs me&quot; that  on September .87th&apos; some thousands  of unemployed marched In pro- cession j,. headed by torch bearers, to the  Library Buildings, Wallaoo- Square,  A meeting of  the.&apos;-Fourth.  Ward Committee was in progress.,- *&apos;. &apos; The leaders of  the demonstration  were  Alec. Geddes, James Murphy and Thomas&apos;  Calderwood,- who  with  five others were received by the  Provost,  Ho  disorder occurred, but a. second very large meeting  was  held  at the  Town  Hall cn September  5th-at which Ceddes was in the  Chair;   as  a result of this  meeting on October 2nd a deputation of unemployed, again headed by Geddes, held up  the  Parish  Council until it agreed to adopt the Board of Health  scale of relief:   a crowd. numbering seme thousands waited  outside,  subsequently chairing Geddes and  carrying, him at the head  of a,procession to  Wallace Square,   The  magistrates have issued an order prohibiting processions, particularly demonstrations under the auspices of the  Greenock Unemployed Committee,      It  is  reported,  on&apos;-tho  authority of a  single  informant,.that the  national march of unemployed will be timed to  reachLondon on-November loth, &apos;    .,..&apos;&apos;    .

the following circular out:-Question Ho. 1*     What will &quot;the men have to do about signing     on at Labour Exchanges?Answer     They will have to mate application to  the Local     Labour Exchange for a travelling care, which  they     can get signed at Labour Exchanges on  the road each     day.Que st ion Mo. S.     Will this ensure the men getting their Labour     Exchange benefit for the time that they  are on     tho march?Answer0 (a)     This all depends.  On the London-Brighton march     which lasted nine days, all the men got  their     benefit with the exception of two.  On the     Birmingham-*London march the Central Axithority of     the Labour Exchange, ruled that they should only     receive benefit for the time that they were stay-     ing in London although they had signed on each day     at the Labour Exchanges on the road.      (b)     Of course this rule was laid down for  the purpose     of discouraging such activities.   But it is  still     possible that the rule can be got over if you can     make arrangements with the Local Labour  Exchange     Manager to the effect that you are tramping the     road in search of work.      (c)     Men who have exhausted their benefit,  especially,     should be encouraged to undertake the  march as they     have no obligations with the Labour Exchange.Question No. 3.     What will &quot;the attitude of the Boards of  Guardians     be towards their families whilst they  are on  the     march?Answer (a)     This is purely a Local question and will depend     upon what arrangements the Local organisation can     make with the Guardians.      fb)     Make a strong point, when interviewing the Guardians   .  on this question, THAT THE MEN ARE UNDERTAKING THE     MARCH FOR THE PURPOSE OP INTERVIEWING  MINISTERS 03?     THE GOVERNMENT TO URGE THAT THE NATIONAL EXCHEQUER     SHALL SHOULDER THE BURDEN OP MAINTAINING THE  UN-     EMPLOYED, AND THEREBY RELIEVING TEE LOCAL AUTHORI-     TLES OP THE BURDEN.     This is a point that will appeal to the  Local     Guardians and possible adequate provision will be     made for the families whilst the men are on the     march.Que stion/

On September 26th the Poplar  Unemployed passed a reso-     lution to picket all ships in  the  East India dock which were     being used for the transport of ammunition to  the Near  East..I35SH REVOLUTIQMRY ACTIVITIES LIT GREAT. BRITAIN               :          The firm attitude adopted by  the Provisional Government     is generally approved by the Irish in Great Britain who     realise that more stringent measures  are necessary  in dealing     with tho rebels.          An attempt is being made  to re-organise moderate Irish     opinion on the lines of the old United Irish League.  Cir--.     oulars signed by ireland^-O1 Connor  are  being sent out  as a pre-. .-     liminary to a conference*   All through the recent  agitation     moderate Irish opinion in this country remained voiceless,     and the followers of the old Nationalist Party allowed  irre-     sponsible Sinn Peltiers and SelfwBetermination Leaguers .  to ...     dominate the  situation.   The idea is to link up  the old                                                   Nationalist/
 nationalist; Party with, the  Free State side of the Sinn Fein movement  to support tho Provisional Government.      Tho  movement is reoeiving sympathetic support hut even T.P.O,Connor admits that thore are great difficulties in the way.  An  entirely new organisation is necossary as the United Irish League is too much associated with conflicts of opinion in  the past.   Jamas Brady  of Clapham, London Organiser of the United  Irish League,  is already busy sounding opinions and asking  for  suggestions.   The new organisation will of course be opposed by Art OfBrion and his Republican followers but these carry very littlo weight now.  The chief difficulty! to he overcome  is the state of apathy into which Irish opinion! generally in this country has fallen.      Art  OxBrien presided at a meeting of the Roger Casement Sinn  Fein Club  at 84,  Blackfriars Road on September 28th:  the notice calling  the meeting  requested members to make known to f their friends that mass would be offered on October 1st in St.Anne,s,  Underwood Street,  33., for the souls of ReginaldDunne and Joseph 0*Sullivan.     Roderick J.  Connolly,  President of the Communist Party of Ireland is  reported to  have beon in Berlin in touch with ro- volutionary Indians:  he  returned to London this weak and stayed at 24, Doughty Street, Bloomsbury.     George  MoLay,. the  Treasurer of the organisation, visited London during the  week.     Under  the  auspices of  the Dr.O*Dwyer Republican ClubFather Tor ley addressed  a meeting in Traynor*s Hall,. Coatbridgfl on Sunday 24th  September.   During his speech ho said two great anniversaries occurred  tliis week.   On the 18th they had the anniversary  of  the  release  of Kelly and Dokey from the Prison Van in Manchester  and on the  20th that of the death of RobertEmmett.    In  conclusion he  urged his hearers to teach their                                                    children/
children to remain staunch end loyal to their grand oldFenian doctrines, oven if so doing necessitated the sacrifice of their lives.     Mrs. Cathal Brugha arrived in Glasgow on September 25thfrom Edinburgh, where she had been visiting some friends.she was met by Joe Robinson, Tom Wilson, H.W.Hut chins on andothers.   Sho spofce in the Brugha Hall, Go van^ on tho 27thSeptember, with Father 0*Brien in the chair:  Joseph Robinson,William Trovers and others of the advanced school were presentand also addressed the meeting.
