There Is growing discontent among  the  unemployed in various parts of the country:  some  200 forced an  entrance into the GuardiansBoard room at Lincoln this week and a disturbance occurred at Glasgowyesterday.  Maximum sentences have been  i&amp;posed  upon five of the  menconcerned in the recent riots at  Port Glasgow.          Communist officials are taking renewed interest in theunemployed panel It is said that money will  be forthcoming  for thepurpose of organisation.          Officials of the organised unemployed  are  working out plans for the march to London.         Details are given of the communist plans for  th.e municipalelections In November.            It ia probable that the annual conference of the Communist  Party of Great Britain in October will be held in the St. PancrasI Town Hall.1   ,    .            Tom Mann has gone to South Africa where, in addition  toin.ecturing, he intends to establish connection between the British  Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions and the rebel  element          The tracrway dispute has reached a critical stage, butNegotiations are still in progress.
THE O0MMDBIST3          The Communist P^orty-1^^            to se^rure-i;]be     St. Pancras Town Hall for the annual c-ooafareaoe InrOafortear     hut is keeping its intentions as quiet as possible.  There     seems little doubt that certain London officials are     anxious to &quot;rig&quot; the conference:  Inkpin has explained at     great length to the Scottish Organiser that &quot;we have  to     educate the membership&quot; so that branches will give their     delegates &quot;a practically free hand&quot;, although he anticipated     that members still have &quot;old fashioned ideas as to Party     Congresses composed of delegates with minute and binding     instructions as to how they should vote on every paragraph,     comma, semi-colon ana full-stop on the Conference iigenda.&quot;          There is reliable information that two secret political   .  agents have been dispatched to Great Britain from Moscow     recently,  but their Identity is not yet known.          It is reported that the Conaffunist Party will send     eight men, among whom will be David Bamsay, and two women     to the Fourth Congress of the Third International in  Moscow.          On September 13th Albert Inkpin sent the following     important circular regarding the November Municipal     Elections to all branoh secretaries:               &quot;The changed circumstances brought about by the          amendments to the Labour Party Constitution carried at          the Edinburgh Conference,  require careful consideration          in view of the  forthcoming municipal elections in          November,   The  situation arising will be  a test  of          communist  capacity to  deal with a delicate and diffioult          position,  wherein, without sacrificing our principles          in the  slightest  degree,  we shall maintain solidarity          with the organised workers in  their  struggle  against          the  capitalist  parties.               &quot;Many  of our  members,  elected to local councils         under the auspices of  the  Labour  Party, on the         nomination of bodies (such as  the  British  Socialist         Party , that  have since been absoryed  in the Communist         Party, may be refused endorsement  by Labour Parties  on         the grounds of the Edinburgh decisions.  It goes                                                   without/
 without saying that a strenuous fight  should he  put up against such a boycott.    This boycott can be arrested by the members concerned immediately taking up individual membership of the Local  Labour Party in accordance with the recent  decision of the  Party Executive.  The efforts of  sympathisers in trade union, branches and co-operative societies  should be  enlisted ) wherever possible, and by this means sufficient  stir should be created to remove the banr in some oases at least.&apos;   In so far as this  is  accomplished,  a blow will be struck at the prestige of the off:5erial leaders of the Labour Party and communist influence increased.  Bo effort,  thereforei should be neglected to get  our own Party  members placed on the list of  Labour Party nominees for the forthcoming municipal elections.      &quot;Where our efforts fail to remove the ban.  a deputation from the branch  should immediately  wait upon, the Local Labour Party with a vxew to negotiations being opened to reserve a number  of seats to be  fought by communist candidates run by Communist Party brancheSj, but receiving the general endorsement of the Local Labour Party;   Alternatively, candidates run by unemployed workers,  communists  or not,  should be suggested;  an essential stipulation in this  case being  that such candidates  accept the  demands  and programme of the National Committee  of Unemployed Workers.  Under, no circumstances should a member of  the Party  run under any auspices (Communist Party., Unemployed Committee or otherwise) in  opposition to official Labour1 Party candidates,,  In  cases  where  our retiring communists.candidates were  elected, not  as Labour members, but as communists pure and simple, it is assumed - in view of the Party&quot;s.  efforts  to secure a united working class front  nationally  and locally - that they will not be  opposed  by the Labour  Party. Approaches should be made to the Local Labour  Party for the  endorsement and support  of such candidates,  and in the event of official Labour  Party  candidates  being nominated against them,  the  branches concerned should immediately inform Headquarters  so that the  local circumstances can be considered  and  branches assisted with counsel and advice.     &quot;Under no circumstances should  communist  support be  given to independent  candidates,  however  good their past record,  who are not  responsible to working  class organisations.     &quot;In general,  active  support  must  be  given to Labour Party  candidates everywhere.    This  follows  from the united front  tactic already  agreed upon in parliamentary contests.     &quot;Our influence must  be  unflaggiagly exercised in the direction of  stiffening the  Labour ejection  programme in  an  anti-capitalist  direction.  Despite  Edinburgh there  are many  ways in which this can  be  done.     &quot;Although  an effort  is made  in  this  circular to cover  every possible  contingency  that  may  arise we      mrecognise that  local  oirctaustanoea may  be  such thatsome branches may  find it almost impossible  to carry outthe tactic  outlined.  In  those cases we rely upon themto carry out loyally  the general policy of the Party                                              lay/

On behalf of the Executive Committee of                    the Communist Party..                         Albert Inkpin....              .  .              Secretary.&quot;     The Gorruuunist Party has requested the Labour Partyto raise in the House of Commons the &quot;obsolete law&quot;under which Hawkins was unseated at Edmonton in consequenceof having received poor law relief:  Hawkins has been instructed to put up for re-election-     The sub-executive  of the Communist party has given thePlymouth branch sanction to nominate George Ebury as amunicipal candidate in  opposition to Lady ,astor.     Vaughan, Holmes, Valentine and Taylor have been vo*to serve on the Electoral Committee of the Communist party which is considered by the sub-executive to be unsatisfactoryin its present form.     The communist attitude to the proposal for an &quot;IndustrialTruce&quot; is defined in a  circular which has recently been sentto various trade union branches by the London Central joint council: -          &quot;A proposal has recently been discussed in both     financial and Trade Union circles? to arrange a ten     years Industrial Truoe between Capital and Labour.          &quot;This means a mutual agreement between employers     and workers, fixing the present as the standard of     working hours and wages for the coming ten years.          &quot;Apart from the impossibility of carrying out     such an agreement, should it be made, we thing it our     duty to point out to every Trade Unionist the     implications of such a policy.          &quot;Can you thus abdicate all claim for ten long     years to a better existence, knovving as you do so well     that both materials,  labour power and machinery are ready     for  the  production of everything required for the setting     up of a much higher standard?          &quot;Wages and  general  working conditions are to-day     all  in favour of the  capitalist and against the  worker.                                                       Such/
     Such  a truce would he  an acknowledgaent of the justice     of  such  a  situation, and a pact to make no attempt&quot;     to  alter it for  the next ten years would mean that,    /n,     while all  other  classes of society are able to benefit JT-     by  any and every evolutionary development in the social     well-being of  the community, the most valuable section     of  that  community, the organised workers, would be     bound hand and foot by the conditions under which they     are existing to-day.   To them along would be barred any       share of  progress, any chance of rising above the     cruelly  unjust conditions which prevail at this moment.           &quot;Whether  we like  it or not, we must recognise     that  the Class Struggle, whether hidden or open, is     always being waged, and any attempt to camouflage it     under the  name of an Industrial Truce must be beaten     back  by  the determined effort of combined labour to     secure for itself a really United Front.  In this     struggle there can be  no truce, a stationary position     is  impossible, and he  who attempts it will be flung     backwards.           &quot;Should your branch wish for a speaker on the     subject  we shall be happy to send you one along.&quot;     E.D.

This fact was, in her opinion, areflection upon her loyalty to the Party,     The disruptive movement in Scotland appears to be growing:   Joseph Payne of Aberdeen, who is in close touchwith Freda Cohen of G-lasgov:, is planning a sort of left wingfederation, which is  to embrace J.S. Clarke, John McLean andthe discontented elements of the Springburn and Brldgetonbranches:   it is, however, unlikely that any of these people will take  definite steps until after the annual conference.Payne has been  asked to take charge of an unofficial: -fortnightly paper which is to be published by the Fife miners.

The Chief Constable of Dundee informs me that the     Russian Steamship &quot;Karl Liobknecht&quot; of Petrograd, was in     Dundee Harbour for a week.  Robert Stewart and other prominent     communists have been keeping company with the crew and     entertained them in their hall on several occasions, but, so     far as can be ascertained, the Russians took no part in     propaganda work.  The vessel sailed on September ISth and a     fairly large crowd of communists saw her off.          The Communist P^rty of Ireland has asked the Communist     Party of Great 3ritain to furnish a list of branch secretaries     in order that they may be circularised for funds to establish     a press for the Dublin branch:  the request has been refused     owing to the financial diffioultie3 of the British branches.

What  MUST also be considered is the fact   *          that  hardships will have to be endured by all concerned.          to  make  this Great National Demonstration the huge  success          which it must be to be  effective.                                                           &quot;We/
           &quot;We at Head Office do not  intend that the      Unemployed Movement  shall be stampeded into any      premature action, but  are determined that the whole      organisation of  this March shall be  carried out in a     c      systematic and efficient manner.  This will perhaps      *      necessitate a month  or two of preparation to assure its      success,  but a success it MUST  BE,  that we are also      determined upon.           &quot;This circular  Is a preliminary one, and is being      sent  out  for the  purpose bx collecting the necessary      information prior to the definite and final arrangements      being made which  includes the flaring of the date.  Each      Committee must consider VERY SERIOUSLY the implications      of this march and not  rush blindfold into something thoy      are not prepared  to  carry out.   Every atom of enexgy will      have  to be put into  it,  and every participant must  have      at his or her heart  the  CAUSE for which we fight.                  &quot;THTJ EMANCIPATION 03? OUR.

to demand clobh.es and boots, as woll as the national scale of relief which is part of their programme.  Hajanington openedthe meeting with a somewhat violent speech and all the organisers reported a revival of interest and a &quot;substantial&quot;increase in membership.     Communist officials are trying to induce Harmington,H&amp;ye and Holt to convert their organisation inuo a NationalEmployed and Unemployed Workers1 Commit too Movement, as abasis for a &apos;&apos;Onc Big Industrial Union&quot;;  it is stated thatfuiidn wculc. lo forthcoming for this project * , There are several indications that the Communist Party is talcing renewedinterest in the unemployed, as a rqVa.it... probably, of instructions from Moscow,  P ge Amott has stated that theunemployed movement shows promise  of remarkable activity andthat he ,is satisfied with the spade work done last. year.     Sylvia Paukhurst is also interesting herself, in theunemployed and it is reported, on  the  authority of a singleinformant, that she has a &quot;body of  men.  ready  to break upunemployed marches, thus creating  disorder which  she hopes will result in police action and antagonism between the Force andthe Unemployed,                                               \     Disorderly scenes marked the  visit of some 200 unemployed.to the Lincoln Guardians on September  19th;  George Deer, a prominent communistr requested that the men  outside should begiven shelter from  the rain.  The  Guardians decided by a smallmajority not to admit the men who  then burst into the room:uxjroar ensued and the chairman declared the meeting adjourned.

RED mriSMATIOflAL OF LABOUR UITIOUS          On September 15th Tom Mann, atart-sd his- jororney to South     Africa:  an important part of hie work there will be &quot;the     establishment of connection between the Britlah.BuxsmL.and--tbev     rebel element in the Rand&quot;.          The London conference of the Red International of Labour     Unions was held on September 16th:  the resolutions previously     reported were passed and F, Smith, secretary of the London     Committee was elected a delegate  to the Second Moscow Congress     on October 25th*          The Cardiff conference has been postponed until October     21sts  when it will be held in the Lower Cory Hall:  credentials     for 22 delegates have been sent in but  this number  will  prob-     ably be increased.    S.O.Davies,  miners1 agent for  the Dowlais     District was largely instrumental in postponing the conference:     this man is particularly aotive on behalf of the  Red Inter-                      .  ..      -  the;-     national of Labour Unions in/South Wales coalfield  and has     been appointed a delegate to the  forthcoming meeting of  the     MinersT  International Propaganda  Committee  in Germany.          J.T*Murphy has sent to  various officials of  the engineer-     ing and shipbuilding unions  a &quot;programme&quot; for the workers  in     these  industries, with the  request  that  the  addressees will     become  signatories.   In the  preamble  to  this  document  it is     stated  that:-               &quot;e..Further reductions  of our  wages  are threatened         although  they  are  only  47 per  cent  above  the 1914 level         whilst  the  cost  of living is  90 per cent  above  the standard         of  that year*  :  The methods  of- payment by results which         we have resisted  for many years.have now-been  forced  upon         us on an  extended  scale  and  are to  become  general in  their        &apos; application^   Payment by results is  being enforced for  the         purpose of intensifying the  rate of production  whilst         the basic  rates  of /wages continue to be lowered.              &quot;Brothers the position is perfectly  clear.  To run         away from our&apos; unions.would be futile.-  We mast  unite the         unions.,  The leadership we have had and have today is         hopeless.  A new leadership must be created.  The problem            ?pM3;a -&quot;v  y           ^              is/  .
 is more than national.  IT IS INTERN ATIONAL.  The Amster- dam Interaat ional with its second-hand affiliations con- cerning which we were never consulted has proved and is proving itself every day more and more useless as an ins-trru- ment to assist the workers in their struggle.  IT HAS BECOME AN INSTRUMENT TO ASSIST THE BOSSES IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BEAT US DOM.   We need a new frighting leadership which do os not seek to restore a systeB wtilch lemenJSaBly Jfaili To provide us with the elementary requi re meet-a&quot; of^l^e&quot;,&quot;&quot;^ JeadersEip&apos;/^E*ich will &quot;challenge our class eneaxss, and sTrTve to conquer^Kein.      &quot;Because of these things we set hefore you the follow- ing p ro gramme:- 1*   A UNITED RESISTANCE AGAINST ANY FURTHER REDUCTIONS OF WAGES AND ANY ATTEST TO LENGTHEN THE WORKING WEEK.      &quot;The threat of a further 10/- reduction has been made. Don*t wait until the employers force the pace.  Compel the executives of the Unions to prepare an organised re- assistance NOW.   Insist upon the General Council of the Trades Union Congress drawing together all the forces threatened with wage reductions or a longer week and let us fight together, for it is by this means alone that we can stop the retreat. 2.   PAYMENT BY RESULTS AND WORKSHOP COMMITTEES.      &quot;Under the terms of settlement of the Lock-out pay- ment by results was agreed to.  It is quite apparent that the employers will use this to the fullest advantage and operate it wherever possible.  We believe to set out to smash  it would divide  the workers  rather  than  unite  them. Let us  therefore,  set  out to  CONTROL  ITS  OPERATION^   In many shops where individual piece work is  in operation prices  are so low  that it is barely possible to earn  the minimum rate.   This is mainly because of  the absence of workshop organisation.  We therefore propose:-     (a)  That advantage should be taken of the,Shop     Stewards and Works committees agreement to form     workshop committees in all workshops.     (b)  Where individual piece work is in operation     price fixing should be controlled by  the Workshop     Committee and no price accepted vh ich does not guaran-     tee time and a third.     (c)  Break down the individual piece-work system     whorever possible and substitute the  COLLECTIVE     CONTRACT whereby the wofkers through  their workshop     committees collectively contract to do the work of     the factory.   It is by this method that workshop     committees can be established, NON-UNIONISM ELIMINATED,     AND THE MINIMUM STANDARD MAINTAINED.3.    REORGANISE THE UNIONS.     (a)  Amalgamate at^once nll^the unions in the Enginee-r-     ing and sHpbuilding JnxTnsTiry wEIeE&quot;&apos;EaVe ALL their     members working in the industry.&quot;This/
          &quot;Tills wo propose  as an immediate  practical     measure although we  stand  for  ONE  UNION FOR ALL     WORKERS IN THE  INDUSTRY?-   The  difficulties of those     unions which have  only a part  of their members in     the industry shall he  met  in the following mannor.     (b)  A working  ai-rangoment shall be made between     the amalgamated unions and  those unions with part     membership In one  industry to  ensure solidarity     on any immediate issue.

Many     Republicans,  who are also members of the Gaelic League,, admit     that they cannot now count on much help from the Irish Self-.     Determination League and their only hope is through the Gaelic     League) which, in the past,  has been used as a recruiting     ground for the Irish Republic Army.  Art 0&apos;Brien and his     followers are still hopeful of propping up their now almost,-.:     hopeless position through this organisation.   Among the.     speakers, on September 23rd will be William Gillies of the     Scots National League.          The pronouncements of various American public men who...     have recently visited Ireland, especially Bishop Turner of     Buffalo, are  doing considerable damage to the Republican     cause in this country.  Bishop Turner had been a great personal     friend of de  Valsra during his American tour and after     visiting Ireland he publicly denounced de Yalera&apos; tactics in a     sermon at Athlone and also on his return to America gave a     press interview and warned the Irish people in America to send     no more money to the Republicans.  Their followers, he said,     were made up  of a handful of misguided erratic persons whose , -     conduct could be compared with that of bandits.  Free state     supporters here are making the most Of these declarations,     which are embarrassing to the Republicans.          District Committees and branches of the Irish Self-     Determination League all over the country are liquidating     their affairs.   The  mid-Durham District Committee has been                                                       dissolved/
 dissolved by a unanimous vote owing  to the  anti-Treaty policy adopted  at the recent London Conference of  the  League.   The members  of this Committee decided to hold themselves in readiness to support  any scheme which  has for its  object the carrying out of the policy of the Provisional Government. Several  branches have,  during the week,  repudiated  yhaftesbury Avenue and decided to support the Preo State.     As  an illustration of the  widespread activity  of Republican propagandists,  may  be  mentioned the  fact that a bundle of literature  containing copies of &quot;The  Fenian&quot; and &quot;Boblacht na L-Eireann&quot; (Republic of Ireland^ have  been received by the American Minister at Prague.&apos;-   Both these pamphlets set forth the war  news in  Ireland from the rtep; blioan point of view. -     Father Torley Is active  in Scotland, and addressed a meeting  of ab -ut  200  in the  Foresters  Hall, Dundee,  on  September 13th.    Tom Wilson, whom the  Scottish  Sinn Feiners  are  running for  the  post of Republican Organiser in  Scotland, in opposition to Joseph Robinson, was in the  chair.    The meeting was organised by the Republican Committee  of  Dundee  and several Free  Staters, who  are  in a majority in the  town but  are not so active  as the Republicans,  attended.    In  the  course  of his address  Father Torley made  uncomplimentary  reference  to the  late Arthur Griffith and  Michael  Collins and this  gave  offence to  the Free  State sup- porters  who  protested and  left  in a  body.     Edmond  B.  Fitzgerald, M.A.,  at  present living  at  27, Gordon Street,  Govan,  continues to  supply Joseph Robinson  with Republics: propaganda for  publication in the  &quot;Republic of  Ireland&quot; which  is now published in  Glasgow under  RobinsonTs supervision.   Fitzgeraldalso supplies &quot;The Irish World&quot; of Hew York with material of the same nature,  some of  which appeared  in a recent Issue  of that paper.
