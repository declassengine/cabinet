[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1922.SECRET.CP. 4290.CABINET.SPECIAL    REPORT    ON    UNEMPLOYMENT.       No. 77.     Period ended October  13,  1922.    The improvement previously reported in the coal-mining industry continues in allDivisions except Wales, where there is no appreciable change.    Activity in the iron and steel industry in the North-Eastern Division is spasmodic,and there is no evidence of general improvement. In Wales increased unemployment has been recorded in this industry.  In the Midlands, while  improvement has been recorded in some  areas, depression is reported in others.    Employment  in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industry is intermittent Inthe South-Western Division, and, although no change has occurred in the position inthe North-Eastern Division, there appear to be some prospects of increased employ-ment in the future.   In Wales some activity in ship repairing has been reported at certain centres, but depression is still the rule in other districts.    No revival has occurred in the engineering industry, and the prospects of evenany small improvement appear at the moment to be remote.    A slight falling-off in the hosiery trade is reported from the Midlands Division.In the North-Eastern Division little change has occurred in the woollen and worsted    Unemployment in the lace trade in the Midlands is still abnormal, and there areno signs of improvement.    The building industry in the South-Eastern Division is quiet, although prospects are hopeful.  In the South-Western Division there is some seasonal unemployment inthis industry.  In other Divisions the building trade remains quiet.    The pottery trade in the Midlands shows improvement at one centre, but a largenumber of operatives are working short time. In the North-Eastern Division there isa general depression in the glass-making trades.    Depression still exists in  the paper-making industry, and the position in the welsh tinplate and copper and spelter industries shows no improvement.THE  SITUATION.industry.T. J.

During 1919 it  ranged between 1-6 per cent,  in September and 3-2 per cent, inDecember, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.    During  1920 it ranged between 0-9 per cent,  in April  and 60 per cent, inDecember, and averaged 2-4 per cent, for the year.The figures for 1921 were:   To the end of         January        February        March        April        May        June        July        August        September        October        November        DecemberPer cent.   6-9   8-5  100  17-6  22-2  231  16-7  16-3  14-8  15-6  15 9  16-5?he figures for 1922 are: To the end of        January ...

In some items in the Report the figures given relate to Great Britainand Ireland, in  others to Great Britain only.   In each instance the scope of thefigures shown is clearly stated.  Where figures relate to works financed partially bythe Government, or to other expenditure from Government funds, they have in allcases  been  given for the  area  (Great Britain only,  or Great Britain and  Irelandtogether, as the  case may be), the expenditure  in respect of which is met by theBritish Government.

[From Autumn 1920 onwards.]                      Cabinet Unemployment  Committee.    The  prospect  of a  severe trade depression first became evident  in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meetingof the Cabinet, when  the  Cabinet Unemployment Committee was  appointed  toconsider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.                        (A.)  Unemployment Insurance.    An Unemployment  Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the8th November, 1920.  The Act applied compulsory insurance  against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously.  Subsequent amendingActs modified the  conditions as regards  rates of  benefit,  extended the periods  ofbenefit and increased the contributions.  As from November 1921  the Unemployed.Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act,  1921, made temporary provisionfor grants  in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children,  and imposed  a.special levy to provide for these grants.   The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922,which operates as  from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grantswith Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment insurance contributions,  and extends  until  June 1923 the special periods  during  which&quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn.  The authority to borrow money from the-Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing  amount  paid  out in  Unemployment Benefit  (including Benefit  in      respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period  November 8,      1920, to October 7,  1922.    (Figures for Northern and Southern Ireland      are included up  to  the 31st December, 1921, and  the  1st  April,  1922,      respectively.)Unemployment benefit and dependants&apos; benefit paidContributions from     Employers    Employed persons    State    State (in  respect of benefit  for  ex-regular        sailors,  soldiers and airmen)  Balance of  benefit  paid over contributions (pro-      vided mainly out of the accumulated reserve      fund of over 20 millions and advances by the      Treasury amounting to   14,350,000)[8999]     97,564,00025,936,00023,620,00015,821,000 2,334,00067,711,00029,853,000B 3
                  (B.) Emergency  Works and  other  Measures.     A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the latermeasures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues  of thisReport.   At least 250,000 men have  had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over  99,000 men are employed, exclusive of the workprovided for  men in  ancillary occupations and the  effect  of the Export Creditsocheme (see table below).     In June 1922, the Unemployment Grants Committee and the Ministry of Transportissued circular letters  to Local Authorities  inviting them to submit  schemes for works of public utility, which, with assistance from State funds, might be undertaken for the relief of unemployment in  their respective areas.  Approved  schemes are.assisted  by grants made on  the same bases as heretofore.   In the case of schemesassisted  by the Unemployment Grants Committee, particulars of  grants already sanctioned are set out  below.     In September 1922, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries issued circularletters to  County  Councils  (except the London  County  Council) and DrainageAuthorities, inviting them to submit schemes of land  drainage which, if approved,might be assisted on fundamentally the same conditions as those  applicable in thecase of schemes assisted last year.  All applications must, however, be received inthe case  of Drainage Authorities on or before December 1,  1922, and in the case ofCounty  Councils  (Agricultural  Committees) on   or  before  December  16, 1922.Particulars of grants sanctioned  and of the number of men employed to date are shown below  (see table 6).   County Councils were also  circulated with  regard to schemes  for the supply of water  to farms, the conditions of assistance from  theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries remaining substantially the same as last winter,with the exception that the  Ministry, instead of advancing  the whole cost  otanyscheme and recovering a proportion from the owners concerned, will  make grants to cover part only of the total cost  of each scheme.SUMMARY SHOWING  THE  LABOUR EMPLOYED  IN GREAT  BRITAIN    AT OCTOBER 6, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED    TO ABOVE.Scheme.
