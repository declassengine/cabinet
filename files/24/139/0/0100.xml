        THIS EOGUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY OF.HE BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SIfeECRET.  .G&quot;o P c43&quot;00 .                         CABINET *                            SITUATION IN IRAQ,a.             Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.                  I append, a note which has been addressed to me by        the Chief of the Air Staff which I consider to be of an        Importance that requires its early consideration by the        Cabinet..                                             S BH .                                      Secretary of State for Air,        Nov . 9th, 1922.,        Secretary of State,.                  I desire to draw your attention to telegram No.788        dated November 7th from the High Commissioner of Iraq,, a        copy of which has been forwarded to the Air Ministry from the        Colonial Office.                  I do not want to touch upon the political issues        involved in the occupation of Iraq, but as the Air Ministry        is now responsible for the British garrison I feel bound to        point out that the present strength and distribution of the        garrison is not such  that the question of the continuance of        our occupation in Iraq can be safely left open, .  So long as        there is uncertainty either as to our staying in Iraq at all,        or as to the restoration of portions of Iraqian territory to        Turkey, the military situation from the point of view of the       - security of the garrison and of the white population is        seriously prejudiced, owing to the state of unrest it        engenders..   This unrest has already been increased by recentjl       public statements that the whole question of our staying in        Iraq will be reconsidered.                                            Ho THEN CHARE.!        Air Staff.                                 C.-,A.S,I        9/11/22,,.
