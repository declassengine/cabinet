[This Document is the Property of His Br^                     should be        returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]fFRANCE..Telegram from Lord Hardinge (Paris)      D.   22nd September, 1922.      R.   8.0 a.m.  23rd September,  1922.No. 472.  B.v Bag.       Following from Lord Curzon.       Have just returned from meeting of quite un- precedented description.  Our object was, I under- stood,  to discuss terms of possible general agree- ment  between ourselves as to bases of future con- ference,  and indications that might be given in issuing invitation to -Kemal.  Accordingly I began by  expounding main propositions concerning  . Constantinople, Thrace and Straits, for which I sought and received approval of Cabinet yesterday.       As regards Thrace I was particularly anxious that  any invitation given to Kemal should not wholly prejudge question, or leave him to think that Turkey would regain entire pre-war frontiers and authority. I-had in mind possible erection of a buffer State under League of Nations in Eastern Thrace.  Poincare commenced by reading out accounts of military position of most menacing description, declared that-the sole chance of peace was to make overtures to Kemal at Mudania, since he would absolutely decline to  come to Europe,; and that indispensable condition was immediate promise of Maritza frontier and                                       Adrianople/
Adrianople.    He wanted this declaration to  bemade tomorrow without any reserve or qualification.1 contested poincare &apos;s account of militarysituation, arid remarked incidentally that if  itwas as he said, and if Harington were forced  to evacuate, which I did not believe, the reproachwould not be his, but that of those who had abandoned him.      Poinearl then commenced a second speech by abitter attack on Harington whcm he accused of  havingdeliberately misrepresented to his colleagues theattitude of the French and Italian governments.I instantly and indignantly repudiated this charge;whereupon Poincars&apos; lost all command of his temperand for a quarter of an hour shouted and raved atthe top of his voice, putting words into my mouthwhich I had never uttered,refusing to permit the slightest interruption or correction, saying thathe would make public the insult to France, quotinga telegram from Athens to the effect that theBritish Minister had asked the Greek Government  tofurnish 60,000 men for the defence of Thrace andthe Straits, and behaving like a demented school-master screaming at a guilty school-boy.  I havenever seen so deplorable or undignified a scene.After enduring this for some time I could stand it longer and rising,, broke up the sitting and left the room.  Monsieur Poincard ultimately came out and made an apology, explaining that he hadbeen exasperated&apos; at the charge that France had                                      abandoned/
abandoned her Ally - a word which for my part Ideclared my wiilin.sn.ees to withdraw - although Isuspect that the sting lay in its incontestabletruth.  I only report this scene as illustrating the peculiar character and ungovernable emotions of theman with whom I am.dealing.  I should not have thought it possible for anyone in such a position,the Chairman and host of the proceedings, to make such a display, and it needed more than ordinaryself-restraint not to terminate the conferenceabruptly and announce my intention to return toEngland.      After half an hour I re-entered the room andthe discussion was resumed.   Monsieur Poincare* once more insisted on his formula for submission to Kemaland defined it as meaning the full restoration of turkish sovereignty  up to the old frontiers, subjectto the demilitarisation of a strip on the Turkishside of the future boundary and a correspondingstrip on the Gre,ek side of the same boundary in western Thrace.   All other question were ignored,Kemal being, left to interpret the silence in his own way.  I asked whether Monsieur Poincare&apos; was reallyprepared to restore  the pre-war conditions, and . .whether Serbia and Roumania would accept such asolution.  In reply  he categorically declared thatthe Serbian King and Ministers had yesterday given him assurances in a sense absolutely opposed totheir conversations  with me and that Eoumania was ofthe same opinion.                                        Seeing/
      Seeing that we were  rapidly  approachinganother impasse,  I said at once that  I mist decline to make the statement  which he proposed, which involved an absolute  surrender to  Kemal  on the mostimportant point of the Pact,  while leaving every -thing else unsettled.   But I then  produced a formula which I had. prepared in  advance  as indicate-ing in general terms  the limits  to which I was prepared to go.   Text of, this has been  telephoned.It closes with a proposal that Harington should goto Mudania to meet Mustapha Kemal  and endeavour toarrange the recognition of lines behind  which theTurks and Greeks are  respectively  to  stand in asia and Europe pending final conference.   Poincare* saidthat he could not accept any f ormula  without sub-mi putting it to his ministers, and he suggested thatif we could not agree ws might  send the  invitationin our own terms, and the French and  Italians intheirs.  He even asked if he might assure Kemalthat though holding hack now, there was  a good chance of our falling into line  later on.  Ideclined all these suggestions and said  that I was willing to stay in Paris,  and resume  discussion ofBritish text tomorrow afternoon, after monsieur poincare* had consulted his colleagues in the morn-ing.  This was agreed to end a meeting is fixed for  p.m.   I shall do my best to  secure a  collectiveinvitation, if that be possible, and, even if theFrench choose to add a private gloss  of  their own.If not, we must each address Kemal in our own way.                                           The/
      The British Cabinet will I  trust appreciate that by these steps we have gained, another day  both here and at the other end, and that Mudania will mean several days more.  Before the end of this time our -preparations should be complete and  in anycase the prospect of en attack upon Chanak or Ismidseems now to be receding.      I grieve to have to report to my colleaguesan experience so painful as that which I have passed through this afternoon and which I hope never to be compelled to repeat.      I intimated to poincare&quot; that at Conference weshould have to raise question of future military position on Chanak side of Straits, upon which  hetaunted me with departure from terms of March last.I replied that military situation was now whollychanged, as had been admitted by his own generalsand admirals.  Indeed he has always declined himself to be bound by anything that was settled in March.      Since writing above I have received a request from Count Sforza to consider whether in lieu ofgeneral phrases about Thrace I cannot accept to-morrow a definite reference to the Maritza andAdrianople in the draft formula suggested.  He  will of course support Poincare;  and he points outundesirability of. several Notes to Turks, and cer-tainty that if concession has ultimately to be  made,French will get the entire credit. This afternoon Iargued that this might produce violent explosionamong Greek army and Greek population in Thrace,  andwould involve complete surrender to Turkish demands,I am reluctant therefore to make concession,, and cannot do it without Cabinet authority.  I willawait your decision.
