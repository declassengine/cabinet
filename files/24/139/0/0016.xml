[This Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.]                (Printed for the Cabinet.    September 1922.)SECRET. CP. 4216.                               CABINET.     I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following telegram received from India regarding  a deputation of Moslem Members  of theIndian Legislature received by the Viceroy.     23rd September 1922.                                    PEEL.   From Viceroy, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State                     for India, 21st September 1922.    I received a deputation of  Moslem Members of the Indian Legislatureyesterday,  and,  in accordance with my promise  to them,  I forward theirviews to you for the information of the Cabinet.    2. I was impressed with the moderation  and restraint with which theyplaced their points before me.   They urged  that Moslem opinion in india was deeply stirred by recent Turkish victories.  Present moment, in theiropinion, was favourable for termination of long hostilities.   While admittinggrave wrong done by Turkey  in siding with our enemies in late war inspite of historical  obligations to us, they earnestly expressed  deep presentsympathy of Indian Moslems, on religious grounds, with Turkey, and  desire that Turkey should not be  dej) rived of the fruits of  victory over Greeks ;that peace should  be concluded, ensuring conditions  essential to  Turkey&apos;position, at an early date ;  and that  Great Britain and the  Empire, with itslarge   Moslem   population,  should  once more  join  in  friendly  relationswith  greatest   Mohamedan  Power.  Essential  conditions  of peace  for turkey,  in their view, were  restoration  to  Turks  of  Ottoman  Thrace,including  Adrianople, Constantinople and  Asia Minor, with  Smyrna, aftersettlement of measures  for  protection of minorities.  As  regards Straits,they appreciated difficulties of situation, and desired Straits to be restored to turkey on furnishing guarantees.  I pointed out that,  in February  last, theywould have been content with neutrality of the Straits in control of numberof nations, together with Turkey, if carried out in a manner to safeguardConstantinople itself against sudden attack by enemy.  It was unthinkableto them that sacred relics of Prophet most revered by Moslems should be atmercy of attack on Constantinople, owing to restrictions on Turkish defence in Straits.   My impression is that it is  to the  latter point they attach mostimportance.  A plan of control of  freedom  of Straits by a European Corn-mission, with Turkey holding a  prominent place on it,  would, I think, satisfythem, unless Turkey itself raised strong objection.  They made request thatIndian Moslems should  be associated in discussions regarding peace.    3. They did not wish, at this moment, to press their views  on  control ofIioly  Places outside  Turkey proper,  or  on Arab settlements, which theyadmit can  be dealt with separately, and at later date.    4.  A motion to adjourn the House to consider the Near East situation,and urge that Indian troops  be not employed  in any dispute in territories of former Turkish Empire, had been  dropped  in the morning, in view  of myconsent to receive this deputation.    5.  It  must be remembered that this was  not a public deputation, andthat Press did  not attend,  and considerable  restraint and calmness weredisplayed.  But public  meetings are taking place throughout India,  andmore jubilation and excitement consequent upon the Moslem victories arenoticeable, and  more extravagant  demands  are  advanced, and, in some places,  bitter attacks are made upon Britain  as  the  outstanding  Poweroperating to check legitimate effect of Turkish triumphs,  whilst!  Extremist(? Hindu) Press points to France and Italy as the more moderating  influencesin favour of Turkish claims.-5749    100  9.22
