This document is  the  property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.SECRET.CP.  4208.THE CABINET.REPORT  ON  THE  SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR THE  WEEK                    ENDING 16th SEPTEMBER,  1922.       MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR  WAR.     I circulate the report on  the Irish situation by the General Officer Conimauding-in-Chief, Ireland, for the week ending 16th September,  1922.                                                                       L.  W.-E.  THE WAR OFFICE,       22nd September, 1922..                                SOUTHERN IRELAND.     (a) Dublin. The military situation shows little, if any, sign of improvement.     The usual nightly sniping continues at the  various Provisional  Government  postswithin the city.  Small garrisons on the outskirts are occasionally attacked with little or no result.     Ambushes of Provisional Government troops  still continue and show  signs of being on the increase.   During the past week some 10 or more ambushes have taken place,resulting in the following casualties :                                                        Killed.  Wounded.              Provisional Government troops ...     ...               6              Civilians...............      2        12Some arrests were also made.  Two of the  arrested individuals endeavoured to escape,,one being killed and one wounded.  Amongst the 12 civilians wounded two are women and  one a girl.  It can be  safely assumed that  the majority of  civilian casualties  areinnocent pedestrians.     Raids by armed men are on the increase, sub-post offices and small business premisesbeing selected in preference to larger establishments.     On 15th September a British despatch rider was held up, near the Four  Courts, byarmed civilians.   A  Rolls-Royce armoured car,  presumably  one of the  ProvisionalGovernment forces, came upon the scene and the attackers fired on the car as it advanced ;:fire  was returned  with the result that  one of the attackers was killed.  The Britishdespatch rider made good his escape during the encounter between the Republicans and the armoured car.     A certain number of prominent Republicans&apos; deaths  are laid to the door of Oriel House(headquarters of the C.I.D.).  Apparently  in retaliation, an attack was made on  the17th September by the Republicans on Oriel House.  The attackers actually got into  thehouse, a fight ensued and one detective was killed.  Casualties to the attackers, if any,are not known.     The postal strike continues.  On 11th September,  200 strikers marched on LeinsterHouse, where the Dail are  sitting, and came in contact with  the police.   Ten  strikerswere arrested whereon the remainder of the  party asked to be arrested.  The names ofthe whole 200 were taken, and, with  the exception  of the 10 previously mentioned, all were released.     No further conflicts between  the police and the strikers have taken place.

      (b)  Outside  Dublin. Very  little information is to hand regarding other parts of Southern Ireland.   Intercepted wireless messages between Provisional Government forces and Dublin and information from  the S.N.O., Haulbowline, are the only items  of  official information that can be obtained.      Several railway bridges have been destroyed, sections of the permanent way torn up and telegraph wires cut.   These are becoming daily acts of the Republicans.      On the  12th instant  the  auxiliary  schooner  &quot; Gaelic &quot;  was looted by Republicans whilst berthed at Kenmare Quay.   On the same date a quantity  of German  arms  are reported to have been found on the s.s. &quot; City of Dortmund &quot;  when being searched.      During  a search in Co. Meath on the.l,3,th. instant, a number of machine guns, rifles and ammunition were captured.      Provisional  Government  troops  at Valentia  were  attacked  on  14th  and were being hard pressed.      An attack on Cahirceveen on 17th September  was disorganised by  searchlights from one of His Majesty&apos;s destroyers.      Cahirceveen.  Valentia and Waterville are held  by a  small  number of Provisional Government  troops.   Republicans have complete freedom outside these towns.      Kenmare was taken on  10th  September  by Republicans who captured a quantity of Provisional Government uniforms, arms and ammunition.      (c) Ulster. Within the six counties the situation has  continued peaceful during the past week  and  only  a few  minor  incidents have been reported.   In the border counties the struggle between the National and Irregular forces appears to be as great as ever.      With  reference  to the discovery of arms in the Sperrins, reported last week, further examination  has shown that the dump consisted of 44  service rifles, 2 Mausers  and 3 shot guns with ammunition and stores.   Only five  of the rifles, all of  which were in good condition, appear  to  have belonged to  any British formation.  The report which stated these arms were those captured from Pomeroy Royal  Irish Constabulary barrack, is incorrect.     A successful police raid in the Lurgan area on the 6th instant resulted in the capture of some interesting  documents and  explosives.   In these  documents there is indication of reorganisation having taken place  in  the  4th Northern Division, Irish Republican  Army, since the Spring, for it appears that there is an  additional  (4th) battalion in each  of  the 2nd and 3rd  Brigade areas of  that Division.   Recently an  intercepted letter showed the existence of an additional 4th battalion in the 4th Brigade, 2nd Northern Division also. The  Irish  Republican Army machine is undoubtedly  being kept thoroughly  efficient within the six counties, though there is reason to  believe  that outside the border the organisation is merely used by  both sides  for the transmission of  orders, &amp;c, and is not maintained in detail.     During the week Belfast has again become active, sniping and bomb throwing being again resorted to.  During the  period  14th  to  17th the  following  casualties have occurred :                                          Killed.     Wounded.     Total.             Protestants      ...      ...     ...            1            1             Roman Catholics...      ...       4          10           14             Police   ............            1             1                                             4          12           16     On the 12th September two British sentries were fired  on in Pettigoe.     On  the  17th instant Commandant 0&apos;Farrel and the 14  other prisoners captured at Pettigoe were released-.  They were sent in military custody to Strabane where they were handed over to the Commandant of the Provisional  Government troops in Lifford.     The Northern Border  Liaison Commission in the report dated 11th September, 1922,point out that happier relations appear  to  exist between people  of  different  shades ofpolitical and religious opinion, which is attributable to-   &quot; (a)  The recent  period of peaceful and  stable  conditions  which has  been enjoyed by           all classes in Northern Ireland.     (6)  Widely-held belief  that  the  forces  of law  and order  are  gradually  gaining           ascendency in  Southern Ireland.     (c)  The influence of officers and men of the British Army.&quot;     There is also evidence of useful co-operation between the forces of  law and order on both  sides of  the border.   A friendlier relationship ajspears  to exist  between the  Royal Ulster Special Constabulary and the forces of the Provisional Government.

The nominal removal of the Press censorship has made but little  difference in the class of news published by the Dublin papers, and no  information is vouchsafed by theProvisional Government except when  they want assistance.   It is, however, now becomingpossible to obtain a general view of the situation in Southern Ireland by a  careful study of the reports published in the pro-treaty papers and  those reported in the  Republicannews-sheets, both of which  probably exaggerate  their  successes and conceal their losses and &quot; regrettable incidents.&quot;   The record of Republican successes given  in Appendix I is interesting, showing as it does achievements which have either not been reported  or onlybriefly referred to in the Dublin Press ; although the results reported may be exaggerated,they show, at any rate, the maximum results achieved by  the  Republicans.   It  will benoted that a very considerable quantity of arms  and ammunition have  been  lost by theProvisional Government troops ;  these are  not counter-balanced by captures made fromthe Republicans.     A number of important Provisional Government leaders have been killed or wounded,the most notorious being Joe Ring, a prominent  leader from  Westport,  Co. Mayo.  Theattitude of a section of the Dublin Press, who endeavour to make heroes of men whowere, in the past, guilty of most atrocious outrages,  is interesting.   The obituary noticeof one Keogh (blown  up by a  mine near  Macroom) describes him  as &quot; selected as one ofthe old Dublin Guard, by Michael Collins and Dick McKee&quot; (both now dead), and &quot; theconfidant and most trusted friend of Michael Collins, being in charge of the Mount Streetbattle on 21st November,&quot; in other words, theof officers in their beds in  Mount Street on 21st November, 1920     Although the official  bulletins report, from  time  to time  the  killing or capture of several  Republican leaders, it is noticeable  that  but  few  of these are men  who  cameprominently to notice in the past.   Two  important Republican leaders, Tom Barry (theliaison officer at Cork) and Oscar Traynor (Commander of  the  Republican section of the dublin Brigade),  have  escaped from  Gormanstown.   With the  exception of  Rory0&apos;Connor, Liam  Mellowes and Ernest 0&apos;Mally (who has  also escaped), these two men are probably the most important prisoners captured in the Four Courts and  Sackville Streetfighting in July.     Southern Ireland is experiencing a  course  of purging;, and stable conditions cannotbe re-established until all arms are in  the hands  of those who support the Government.The political leaders  realise this, and the  people in the main are  on  their side.   Theresources at the disposal of the Provisional Government are untrained and lack discipline.Progress is  bound to be  slow and regrettable  incidents will occur, as the  ProvisionalGovernment appears  to have gone to extremes  in the dispersion  of its forces, and the republicans constantly get opportunities of  concentrating against  weak  garrisons andmen who carried out the dastardly murder
forces.   Without knowing what are the intentions  of the Provisional Government, it is-unprofitable to criticize ; but it would appear that their plans at present are opportunist,and that better results might be achieved by a more methodical clearing of areas and  bythe establishment of armed police forces (civic guard, who are at present doing nothing)in those areas as cleared, thus freeing the troops for progressive operations in other areas.

Mouaghan,  Offaly, Tipperary, Meath and Kerry.  I.R.A. columns suddenly concentrate r.nd  march upon a town held by  the enemy. A massed  attack is delivered on his  posts, casualties inflicted, prisoners and often whole garrisons taken, and arms and  ammunition captured.
