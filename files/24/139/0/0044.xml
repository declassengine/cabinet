                Ip examine tho War Bo ok&apos;&apos;^mbt report  to the                Cabinet as to what part of the War  Book                should be put in operation in the event of                hostilities with the Turkish Nationalist^-..,.                         - -   &apos;- - -  ---- -&apos;- --                     V2 e                        INTERIM REPORT     In considering what portions of the War Book shouldbe put into operation in the event of hostilities with theTurkish Nationalists, the Subcommittee have assumed thaiapproximately two Divisions with a proportion of extra-.Divisional units would be mobilized, and that the area ofhostilities would he confined to the Near East,.3c    The War Book has been drawn up to admit of thenation passing from a state of peace, through a time ofstrained relations when the Precautionary Stage might beintroduced, to a War Stage*   The War Book accordinglyprovides for the bringing into force of a &quot;Precautionary&quot;Stage and &quot;War&quot; Stage.- when certain departments of Govern-ment take measures in anticipation of or upon the outbreakof war.4B     The Eoard of Customs for instance issue a &quot;warningtelegram&quot; to all Collectors which involves action by themwith regard to the control of aliens, the naval intelligencescheme, censorship, treatment of  enemy  shipping and other action,   The Colonial Office issue  &quot;warning&quot; and &quot;war&quot;telegrams to all Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates, Man-dated territories, Aden and Zanzibarj and on  the receipt  ofthese telegrams the administration  concerned  brings intooperation the Defence Scheme, establishes Censorship andtakes other  action appropriate to the situation.5C     Such far reaching measures are inappropriate to thesituation&apos;now being&quot;&apos;examined?   Moreover, relations with  theTurkish Nationalists have been, strained for  some time, andcertain, measures proscribed -in the  Precautionary Stage havealready been taken;.    ;.- &quot;-:                     &apos;&apos;-.-&apos;.--^
  60   We therefore recommend that no notification of the initiation of &quot;Precautionary^ Stage and &quot;War&quot; Stages beissued^ but that in the event of the outbreak of hostilities with the Turkish Nationalists the Departments should take such action as they may consider necessary to communicatein appropriate terms the state of affairs to local or otheradministrations with which they are concerned,,  7o   The War Book has been designed to meet the situationwhich would arise in the event of a world war in which thewhole resources of the Empire would be drawn upon?,   Thatis not the situation that now presents itselfe   We are accordingly of opinion that any Department whose duty it isto  initiate action under any specific heading of the WarBook should be responsible for seeing that such limitedaction is taken under that headings as is appropriate  tothe situation now under considerations  8,   We called to our meetings representatives of  theother Departments not represented on  the Sub-Committee ?dioare concerned in the  action set  forth  in the War Book, andhave considered the various spheres of action allotted to each Department in  detail.  9^   Subject to the qualifications  stated  in paragraphs  and 7  abovet we recommend          (a) That the following sections of the War           Bock should be put into  operation t-
