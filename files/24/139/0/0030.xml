conversation which he had with Nationalist agent there4 days ago.    &apos;when the nationalist agent ashed why Serbian Governmentinsisted upon taking part in near East Conference,  theSerbian Minister stated that Serbia was vitally interested inanything which was likely to affect situation in the Balkans.He did not think that Serbian public opinion would toleratecommon boundary between Bulgaria and Turkey,  passage of turkish troops from Asia to Europe would be viewed withapprehension by Serbian Government.     Serbian Minister asked what were Nationalists intentionsNationalist agent replied that Turks were out for wholenational pact which included autonomy of -western Thrace.  TheSerbian Minister suggested that allied powers might notbe willing to concede whole of national pact. The Nationalistagent replied that Nationalists would then know that thoAllies were hostile to them and this would mean war whichallies could have if they wishod.   Asked how troops would be transported by Nationalists from Asia to Europe when allies had command of seas, Nationalist agent said that they wouldtransport them across the -lack Sea,-,   Roumanian Minister at paris has declared to hord Curzon Roumanian solidarity withGreat Britain but regarding the provision of troops he in&amp;ioa-ted hesitation on account of the Bole Leviks.  Greek HighCommissioner at Constantinople has stated to British HighCommissioner that he has secret information that Seri SefainCompany was recently asked by Zemal to supply him with four ships to transport his troops to v-europe.  Kemal also askedMinister of Marine to lot him know whether Turkish warships in Golden Eorn were fit for service and whether he could use them.  This latter enquiry was considered by a Council ofMinisters as a result of which Grand Vizier replied that formany reasons ships could not be used in Golden Horn,,     French High Commissioner who returned from Smyrna                                                      on

French High Commissioji^- er.stated that whilst he was at Smyrna he received notelegram frcm his government and that he was unaware of withdrawl of the French detachments from Asiatic shore ofboth straits.  French High Commissioner described kemal astalking more like a victorious general than as a politician.He began by urging kemal not to violate neutral zones as suchaction would bring him up against the three most poverfulEuropean countries.  Eternal replied that his troops were already im motion and that he intended to march as soon aspossible on Constantinople,- Whilst French High Commissionerbelieves Kemal&apos;s statements regarding the rapidity of his army&apos;s movements were partly bluff he is convinced thathe does mean to march on Constantinople.  He will probablymarch on Chanak at the same time,  ICemai said that he musthave Eastern Thrace up to Maritza line.  He made no mention of-Western Thrace.  He said that he must send a certainnumber of troops to Thrace to maintain order but he did not propose to transport a large army there.  He said that ashe was convinced that xngland would not agree tc modifi-cation to any  considerable extent of her policy in Thracehe mUst settle matter by military means,.  His army hadaccomplished one part of its task and must accomplish therest.  He must either go on or demobilise and he must finishthe business before the  winter set in,,     French High Commissioner pointed out  that ICemai mustsurely be reluctant to de-soroy Constantinople but the Turksdid not appear to attach much, weight to this argument,     Mustapha  Kemal sail that he would come to a  conferencebut would not  arrest movements of his troops.  He suggestedconference might be held at Scutari.    . A meeting of Kemal  and,,,his Ministers  is to be held  at                                                    Smyrna

Disquieting reports have been received by italian minister at Athens from Italian agents in  Thrace  as  regardspossibility of general conflagration there *     Cabinet here has informed Lord Curzon  that should  Kemalash for it Russian repre sent at iori at the Conference  wouldnot be objected to, also that both the Asiatic and theCallipoli shore must  be regarded as on the  same footing,viz;- that on both sides there should  be a  zone on thesame regimeu   iiiids.CHURCHILL,

peaceful and orderly re-establishment of Turkish authority.It, will be necessary, however, for the Conference to reach.agreement upon two further points: first, effective guaranteesare indispensable for the security and protection  for the enjoyment by all nations of the freedom of the waters betweenMediterranean and the Black Sea: second, adequate securitiesare necessary for the protection of racial and religiousminorities generally.

My Prime  Minister and myself very much appreciate     your telegraphic reviews giving such complete accounts     of situation regarding Near East.  That His Majesty&apos;s     Government is  doing all in its poker to avert actual     hostilities consistent with safeguarding of British     interests and prestige is fully realised by Mr, Massey.

Following message  for Prime Minister from General     Smuts:-          Begins I  regret that an answer to your  message  of     September 15th has been delayed  by my absence  on tour     in  Inaccessible part of the Union.  In the meantime     position  appears to have altered  materially for the better     and no  longer  to call  for the  active  Intervention of the     Union,          Union  Government understands  arid appreciates deter-     mlnation  of the Imperial Government to maintain the  freedom
of the Straits of the Dardanelles and of the Bosphorus.which was one of the roost beneficial results of the great war.:   They most sincerely trust however that military intervention  of  the Empire will not be necessary for thepurpose  and they rejoice  at the more  favourable tern ofevents which  has been largely brought about by thesuccessful British diplomacy during&apos;the last week.      They believe that  the measures which have.boon takenby  the Imperial  Government to safeguard the &quot;position ofthe  Straits pending the meeting  of the  coming conference will be  found adequate  for the purpose.. Very important questions of  policy would be involved as far as theUnion is concerned by any decision of the Union Govem-ment to  take  part in military operations in eastern europe and it is felt by  the Union Government that sucha step should not be taken without calling  Parliamenttogether.   ...      They are relieved  that that  step la renderedunnecessary by-the more reassuring Information, now intheir possession.-      With regard to  the peace in  the  Near East the UnionGovernment ventured  to  express the  opinion  that thefuture regime for maintaining the .freedom&apos; of the Straitsshould be placed under  the League of Nations,  and  they trust that such a solution will  be  approved by the SomingConference -  ends.      This message will  be handed, to  the Press  here this afternoon for publication.ARTHUR FREDERICK.
Clear the line.          25th September,  &apos; Poll owing for your PrimeMinister begins.  It is reported by General Haringtonthat 2,000 Turkish Cavalry with machine guns have returned to Srenkeui near Chanak more than 20 milesinside neutral zone.  Mustapha Kemal Is being informed of this  and told that Turks must withdraw if fightingis to be prevented.  They have been given  a time limitbefore they are fired upon sufficient to enable Kemal ifhe chooses to recall them.-  The French are adding theirsolicitations.  Following distribution of turkish troops up  to  24th instant is shewn by War Office mapsErenkeui 1,100  sabres Bigha 800 sabres 4 guns North ofGulf of  Adramyti 2,100 sabres  12 guns.  About 50 milesfurther  East  6th and 4th Turkish Corps amounting to25,000 rifles 30 gun--&apos; Smyrna district 24,000 rifles 79guns approaching neutral zone  on Ismid Peninsula 11,000rifles and sabres  24 guns.  Situation appears to be most critical and uncertain.   The  Turks, in spite  ofevery  offer that has been made by  the three great  powers in agreement, may  try to overwhelm us thinking  they  can carry  all  before them by sheer force.   News is  doublydisappointing because we. were  led  to hope  that  thedanger was passing by  the  retirement of  the Turksyesterday. Ends.

PARAPHRASE TELEGRAM from the Secretary of State for the Colonies tp---^-the- Governors General of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, NewZealand and Union of South Africa and the Officer Administering theGovernment of Newfoundland.,              Dated 25th September.(Sent 11. p,M. 25th September, 1922.)Secret  Following message for your  Prime Minister begins Yesterday  theFrench High Commissioner at Constantinople communicated  to the angora government the joint note of the Allies which  as you will have seenhas been published.  In some respects it differs from draft telegraphedto you September 23rd but contains  the main points desired by us.Everything now depends  on Mustapha  Keirtal?s attitude.     A force of about 1000 Turkish,  cavalrymen  advanced on September23rd within the Chanak  neutral zone.  Situation was met  by the officercommanding the British  forces  with  fismmess and restraint a meeting was arranged with the Turks as a result  of whioh Turks have withdrawnfrom the neutral zone..  Against this news must be set  another tele-gram from the British High Commissioner  in Constantinople in which  horecords an unconfirmed  report  that  on Friday decisions of an uncom-promising character were taken by the Angora Government.     French Government  have promised to-instruct their High Commis*sicner in Constantinople to co-operate with the British  officercommanding to ensure maintenance of order in Constantinople...     Practically entire French press welcomes  despatch of the  jointnote with unfeigned satisfaction.   Lord  Curzon!s conciliatory  dis-position is the subject of much eulogy.  Difficulties  which remainare not however disguised.  There are indications that French  mill-tary circles are distressed at the  fact  of their troops  marching off and leaving ours alone. The  French attache here has  expressed sorrowand the French officers in Constantinople are  much  embarrassed.This will not affect Monsieur Poincare.     The Turks were praised for having  &quot;overthrown  creatures  of english Imperialism&quot; during demonstrations which were  held  in  moscow on Saturday to celebrate the  Turkish victories.  Ends.
