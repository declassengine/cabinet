Part I.-INTRODUCTION.IN Paper No. C.O.S. 551 we reviewed the comparative strength of Great Britain with that of certain other countries as at the 1st May, 1937. In a memorandum dated the 17th September, 1937 (Paper No. C.O.S. 616) the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence requested us to undertake a similar review showing the position as at the 1st November, 1937. Informa-tion giving comparative strengths of Great Britain vis-a-vis Italy as at the 1st November, 1937, has already been included in Part 1 of our Middle East Appreciation (Paper No. C.O.S. 603 (J.P.)). Moreover, the general naval position has changed little between the 1st May, 1937, and the 1st November, 1937. In these circumstances, with the approval of the Minister, we forecast in the present report the comparative strengths, and estimate the readiness for war of the countries concerned as at the 1st January, 1938, in accordance with the following terms of reference : (a) Assumptions .Germany and Italy hostile, and France and Belgium in co-operation with us. Russia to be taken in alternatives, either a neutral or co-operating with us.(b) Form of Paper (i) An estimate of the armed strengths by sea, land and air of all thenations concerned as at January 1938;(ii) The likelihood of the assumed Powers considering themselves ready for war to be assessed on the basis of (i) and other factors such as the output of war material in the various countries by the dates mentioned, and the general economic situation.Part II.-RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE ARMED FORCES AS ATJANUARY 1938.2. The strengths of the forces of the nations we are considering are shown in detail in Appendices I, II and III. A mere statement of the estimated military strengths and weaknesses of these nations does not, however, clearly convey the value of their armed forces in the event of war. Other factors, such as the state of the land fortifications, ability of the countries concerned to manufacture or import armaments and the physical conditions in the possible theatres of war have a bearing upon the military situation.We have, therefore, summarised the military aspect as a whole and under conditions of two different political situations, i.e., Russia as a neutral and Russia as our ally.Russia Neutral.3. In respect of naval forces, France and Great Britain will have a great superiority in capital ships and will possess 6 aircraft carriers as against none by Germany and Italy. In other respects also we shall have the advantage as the following figures show : France and      Germany Great Britain,   and Italy.Cruisers............       102 28Destroyers       .........       194 139Submarines      ...       ......       129 116In our opinion such a marked superiority should enable us to exercise decisive economic pressure in a prolonged war assuming that it is found possible to impose an adequate system of rationing upon neutral States bordering enemy countries.4. On land Germany and Italy will possess numerical superiority and, by January 1938, Germany will be able to put 39 divisions into the field on the first day of war and 15 reserve divisions within the first 4 days. All these divisions will have a full complement of Corps and Army troops with the possible exception of medium and heavy tanks. In addition, Germany has 21 to 24 Landwehr Divisions, complete with infantry weapons but deficient in artillery. These divisions are fully capable of ensuring the defence of the German frontiers.  The
French frontier defences are complete (except those along the Franco-Belgian frontier) and the Belgian defences will already be formidable, while the German frontier in the Bhineland will not have attained a comparable state of readiness.The German General Staff are unlikely to consider that the strength of the German Army is sufficient to justify the prosecution of a land offensive before 1939-40. Further, they do not think that the Army will have attained its maximum efficiency until that date.5. In the south, Italy could in all probability mobilise more divisions than she could employ, since the mountainous nature of the country on the Franco-Italian border limits the forces which can be deployed.France&apos;s fortifications upon her German frontier and the mountains on her Italian frontier in fact present military obstacles of a strength which make any rapid German or Italian success on land unlikely under conditions to be anticipated in 1938. France&apos;s equipment and maintenance problems are likely to limit the armies she can maintain unaided over any considerable period of fighting to a total strength of some 40 divisions, and Great Britain will be in no position to render her material assistance either in the form of troops or equipment.6. In England the reorganisation and re-equipment of the Army will have reached a stage at which not more than an organised force consisting of a corps of two divisions with ancillary troops could at first be made available for despatch to a theatre of war. This force is known as the Intermediate Contingent. In addition to this corps, a proportion of the regular army at home could be mobilised, as far as personnel is concerned, and grouped into smaller formations for despatch overseas as reinforcements to existing garrisons. These reinforcing units and formations would not, however, be in possession of adequate quantities of modern equipment-see paragraph-2 of Appendix II for details.Of this total at least one division and anti-aircraft units would be required to reinforce the garrisons of Egypt and the Sudan, and further units will be needed to bring other Mediterranean garrisons up to war strength. There is also the possibility that reinforcement of the Middle East may become necessary.The presence of two corps of her Metropolitan Army permanently in Libya might now enable Italy to carry out operations against British and French interests in North Africa, without her intentions being discovered until just before she moved. Sustained operations against Egypt would necessitate an accumulation of reserves, and there is no evidence of such taking place at the present time. The increased volume of sea traffic, however, due to the presence of the white corps in Libya, would probably enable preparations to be carried out by January 1938 without exciting suspicion. Two of the above-mentioned Italian divisions are fully motorised, and, although we might hope for a degree of warning from their concentration in the localities where water is available, a coup de main against Mersa Matruh has now become a more definite possibility. Certain steps of a comparatively minor nature to improve our defensive position at Mersa Matruh have recently been under consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence.*7. The conclusion from the above paragraphs is that none of the countries specified, considered individually, will be in a position by January 1938 to embark on a major land offensive with any great prospect of success in Europe. The ability of Italy to make a sudden attack on Egypt from Libya has increased, but at the same time for a variety of reasons, notably her commitments in Spain and Abyssinia, the probability from a purely military point of view that she would take independent aggressive action in January 1938 appears no greater. The strengths of Germany and Italy will, however, both be more than adequate to maintain a defensive strategy by land.8. A comparison of air strengths is given in Appendix III and shows that it is in respect of this part of their military forces that Germany and Italy are likely to have the greatest advantage over France and Great Britain. They will not only be considerably supei&apos;ior in first-line strength as a whole, but particularly in long-range bombers capable of attacking objectives in British territory from distant bases in their own countries. In combination the German and Italian aircraft of this type will possess a disposable bomb lift of some 1,200 tons of bombs as against approximately 450 by the French and British.* C.I.D. 300th Meeting, Minute 6.
In addition to this disparity in the power of the offensive, we would emphasize the very advanced state of German defence measures compared with those of France and Great Britain against air attack, both as regards A/A guns and searchlights and air raid precautions, as disclosed in the despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Charge d Affaires in Berlin, dated the 18th August, 1937 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1351-B). Also where aircraft reserves are concerned, owing to the temporary, but none the less severe, disorganisation of the French aircraft industry, combined German-Italian output of aircraft will be greatly superior to that of the French and British industries for several months after the outbreak of war.9. In paragraphs 26-29 below, we consider what Italian policy is likely to be in the event of war against France and Great Britain, and we conclude that she would be unlikely to detach any considerable proportion of her air striking forces for independent operations against Great Britain from bases in Germany. It is, however, not inconceivable that by January 1938 an attack on this country by the German Air Force, with the support of some Italian squadrons, might be developed on a scale of about 600 tons a day at maximum intensity, or 300 tons a day for sustained attack. The extent, however, to which attack can be sustained will depend on the efficacy of our defence, including the counter-offensive. In January 1938 our defence will not have reached a relatively high scale of readiness.Russia as an Ally of France and Great Britain.10. The following are the principal additional forces which Russian inter-vention would introduce : 184 submarines (about 50 of which are stationed in the Far East); a force of 17 divisions immediately, rising to 53 divisions within a week and to rather more than 100 in three months; 3,050 first-line aircraft, exclusive of 869 specifically earmarked and located for operations in the Far East.11. It is important to note, however, that with the exception of her submarines, and about 600 of her longest range bombers, Russia could not employ any of these forces against Germany or Italy without violating neutral territory, unless, of course, the intervening States were themselves already in the war. The attitudes of the Baltic States, Roumania, Czechoslovakia, and particularly Poland, are, therefore, of great importance in assessing the value of Russian military assistance to France and Great Britain. Moreover, we cannot ignore the probability that Russian intervention on our side might lead to Japanese support for Germany and Italy. Such an occurrence would have far-reaching effects upon the naval situation.12. On the hypothesis that Poland and Czechoslovakia would remain neutral, Russian intervention would have little immediate military value for us, since her aircraft would have no means of attacking Germany without violating Polish neutrality, except by indirect flight via the Baltic. By this route the distance from Russian territory to Berlin is about 780 miles. In these circum-stances even Russia&apos;s long-range bombers, whose operational radius of action is about 850 miles, could not bring any considerable pressure to bear upon Germany.13. With Czechoslovakia friendly, which is a possibility under the Mutual Assistance Pact of 1925, the air situation would be improved. Nevertheless, Germany and Italy might conceivably deny Russia the use of air bases in Northern Czechoslovakia by means of a land advance. In these circumstances, the 600 long-range Russian bombers would provide the only effective means of air attack in the initial stage, and, apart from administrative and supply difficulties, these aircraft would have to violate Polish or Roumanian neutrality in order to reach their advanced bases.14. It is only if Poland is friendly and willing to co-operate that Russian intervention on behalf of France and England could quickly develop into a real menace for Germany, though even then it is more than doubtful whether Soviet railways could continue for long to supply more than a limited number of divisions, while the difference in gauge between the Polish and Soviet railways and the former&apos;s lack of rolling-stock would make supply over long lines of communication a matter of extreme difficulty for the U.S.S.R. In these circumstances, Russia could develop a considerable scale of air attack, and although presented geographically with a wide front on which to operate her
armies, the strength used would be limited by her power to maintain them. Moreover, it seems that, in view of the present internal condition, Russia might be unprepared to employ her army in Europe.15. We have drawn attention to the effect which the attitude of Poland and Czechoslovakia would have upon the military value of Russian intervention so that there shall be no misconception regarding the immediate results likely to follow Russian intervention. The great numbers of Russian aircraft should prove a serious threat to Germany in the East in a war of long duration, as some means of exploiting them would no doubt be found in course of time. But we should be unwise to assume that Russian air forces could initially exert any effective pressure on Germany.16. From the naval point of view, Russian neutrality is infinitely preferable to Russian intervention, if there is any likelihood of the latter leading us into hostilities against Japan.Japan&apos;s present preoccupations in China would not necessarily affect the possibility of her hostile intervention if in 1938 the U.S.S.R. intervened on the side of Great Britain and France. We deal further with the present political and economic situation in Russia and its influence upon the probability of her intervention in paragraphs 38 to 40 below.17. We conclude that, from a purely military point of view, the value of Russian intervention is doubtful. Even if Poland is an ally, the development of anything approaching Russians full military strength against Germany is a matter of serious doubt, and consequently, from our point of view, we cannot expect to obtain much relief from Russian intervention until some time has elapsed.Part III. LIKELIHOOD OF POWERS CONSIDERING THEMSELVES READY FOR WAR IN JANUARY, 1938.18. We have already considered how the probable strengths and efficiency of the armed forces of the Powers concerned might influence their views as to their readiness for war. In the following paragraphs we review additional factors which would be likely to influence these views. We have briefly considered the economic situation, but it is important that this should be regarded as a most uncertain factor.19. The recent pronouncement by the President of the United States of America on the subject of the aggressive nature of the policy of dictator Powers, may have the effect of discouraging Germany and Italy from starting a war which would be regarded as one of aggression by American opinion. On the other hand, these States may think that the immediate future is better for their purpose than a later date, when American public opinion would possibly be so educated that the Neutrality Act would be modified so as to discriminate against an aggressor.20. The present political situation makes it unlikely that any of the Powers which we have assumed as our possible allies would initiate a war. There is greater danger that Germany or Italy might be the aggressor. We therefore examine in greater detail the possibility that either of these two countries might consider itself ready for war than we devote to those countries which might become our allies.As we have already shown, conclusions based on the terms of reference for this paper might have to be considerably modified if other countries such as Poland or Czechoslovakia abandoned their attitude of neutrality.Germany.Armed Forces.21. Apart from the actual comparison of strength in 1938 and its bearing on German prospects of success, Germany, in judging the advisability of risking war in January 1938, will be influenced by the way in which the comparison of strength is likely to alter within the next few years. In January 1938 Germany will be able to mobilise the same number of divisions as France, but by 1939 she is
likely to have a marked superiority. In the same interval of time the contingent which Great Britain could send to the Continent may have increased from two to four divisions with a certain number of units of armoured fighting vehicles which could be made available from the Mobile Division (which at- that time would not be ready for war as a complete formation). This, in the eyes of the German General Staff, is not likely to outweigh the importance of numerical advantage over France.On the other hand, in January 1938 Germany will be far ahead of either Great Britain or France in respect of her power to stage an air offensive, and in her preparations for resisting air attack.Although there have been indications that in some quarters the belief is held that success in war can be achieved by the exercise of air power alone, there is no proof that this represents German military opinion as a whole, and however much certain opinion in this country, conscious of our vulnerability and the state of our defensive preparations, may doubt the issue, it does not follow that Germany is prepared to risk a war in which her hope of success would depend almost entirely on the action of her air force; also in considering her prospects of success by means of air warfare only, Germany must take into account possible action by Russian air forces.22. The comparison of strengths which we have made has shown that the intervention of Italy on Germany&apos;s side would give the German and Italian combination superiority in numbers of divisions and, particularly, of bombing aircraft. We have already expressed doubt as to whether this superiority would be judged sufficient to assure German-Italian success, and in spite of the recent conversations between the heads of the two States, the German General Staff is believed to have little trust in the reliability of Italian promises of intervention. They would probably oppose any policy likely to precipitate war in 1938 if that policy could only be justified by reliance upon Italian co-operation.Economic.23. Our very great superiority over Germany at sea must render the latter apprehensive of the ultimate effect of the economic pressure which she must expect us to develop against her; perhaps the more so were Italy her ally, since the problem of applying economic pressure to Germany and Italy together would in some ways be simpler than that of applying it to either country alone. Our position in this respect would be strengthened by the intervention of Russia, since she might cause some measure of interference to Germany&apos;s communications in the Baltic, whereas, as a neutral she might supply Germany&apos;s needs to some extent. At the same time, Germany&apos;s financial position is weak, while her Four-Year Plan for self-sufficiency is at a stage when it is a liability rather than an asset, and her stocks of raw materials would only support a short effort under war conditions. Arguing purely from economic grounds, therefore, Germany is unlikely to embark on a war in which she cannot foresee a good prospect of gaining a decision in a short time.24. The German output of armaments, already very great, does not appear to have diminished during 1937, whereas recent nationalisation measures introduced in France and internal labour disputes have temporarily reduced French capacity for industrial expansion in emergency, particularly in the case of aircraft. In Great Britain the output of war material will still be on a low scale. In eighteen months&apos; to two years&apos; time our output will have much increased and in emergency should be considerable, while France may well have recovered her equilibrium. For these reasons Germany might feel in 1938 that her industrial position for a war of short duration would be stronger in comparison with that of her potential enemies than would be likely to be the case a few years later.JConclusion.25. If, early in 1938, Germany were faced by a sudden emergency in which the possibility of going to war on her western frontier had seriously to be con-sidered, her military position on land would be a factor tending to dissuade, whereas her military position in the air and in relation to industry would be factors which might encourage her. Economically, however, she must seek a quick decision; and so long as she expects to meet the combined strength of France and
Great Britain she must doubt whether her advantage in air power will be sufficient to promise a quick result. We therefore conclude that, even if assured of the co-operation of Italy, Germany would hesitate to embark, early in 1938, on hostilities against us.Italy.A rmeol Forces.26. The factor which would bear most directly on Italy&apos;s readiness to engage in hostilities would be the role which she would have to fulfil if she went to war as an ally of Germany against Great Britain and France. She would no doubt be conscious that unless Great Britain and France were decisively defeated on their home front her own chance of retaining any territory she might have succeeded in capturing from them in North Africa would be small. It would therefore appear at first sight to be in Italy&apos;s best inteiest to employ her forces with the object of bringing direct pressure against Great Britain and France in the main theatre.27. The prosecution of this policy, however, would involve certain disadvantages for Italy. The southern frontier between France and Italy is unsuitable for the development of a land offensive and the French defences are strong, so that land operations in this area would be likely to prove costly to Italy. The alternative course of initiating an air offensive against the South of France would be equally unprofitable to Italy since her own important industrial areas in the neighbourhood of Milan and Turin could easily be reached by the French air counter-offensive. In view of these facts it would not be to Italy&apos;s advantage to initiate an offensive on the Franco-Italian frontier.28. The only other means whereby she could employ her forces in close support of those of Germany would be by despatching them through Austria to operate in conjunction with the German forces. It seems improbable, however, that Italy would be likely to have made a plan of this kind for her land forces since it would involve far closer co-operation between the Italian and German General Staffs than there now appears to exist. The transfer of air forces to bases in Germany with a view to increasing the scale of direct air attack against Great Britain would be a more likely course of action, and there is already adequate aerodrome accommodation in Germany to permit this being done. Nevertheless, Italy is understood to attach so much value to her air power as a means of countering our sea power in the Mediterranean that it seems unlikely that she would willingly denude herself of any large proportion of her air-striking force in the initial stages of a war against France and Great Britain.29. In view of the above difficulties and disadvantages which would appear to attend any attempt by Italy to develop an offensive in Europe she may well decide that her proper role in this war would be to attack British and French interests in the Mediterranean and North Africa on the assumption that she is in such a strong position locally that we should have to divert a large proportion of our war effort from the main theatre in France in order to maintain our prestige in the Middle East.Such a course of action would have additional advantages for Italy in that she could pursue it without much strain upon her land forces, and could retain her air forces where they were equally effective either for attack or home defence. She would, moreover, be operating against those territories which she might hope to make her own as the outcome of any war against Great Britain.30. If the above is a correct analysis of probable Italian action in a war such as we are considering, the effect it might have on her assessment of her readiness for war is important. Attack upon British and French interests in the Mediterranean is for Italy a limited commitment which she might be quite willing to undertake even in her present state of readiness, so long as she was assured that France and Great Britain would be mainly preoccupied with defence against Germany.31. On the other hand, Italy will still be faced with considerable military and economic commitments in consolidating her position in Abyssinia and giving assistance to General Franco in the Spanish Civil War; both of these enterprises are dependent on sea communications which can be interfered with by naval action and, in addition, the communications to Abyssinia are vulnerable in the Suez Canal to action by land forces.
France and Belgium.34. An attempt to assess the readiness of France and Belgium for war in 1938 by balancing the theoretical arguments which might govern their decision would be misleading.35. There is ample evidence that the position in France, and even more so in Belgium, in regard to war reserves is bad. The partial nationalisation of the French peace-time armament and aircraft industries has been completed on paper, but so far these measures, combined with labour troubles, have had the opposite effect to that desired. Financial, economic and social difficulties have jointly conspired to damp down the pace of French production of armaments and to reduce capacity for rapid expansion, and the present condition of the French aircraft industry is deplorable. Moreover, present reports indicate that lack of equipment, inefficiently executed reorganisation and political interference in the Service, has very seriously affected the fighting value of the French Air Force. The effective power of the Belgian armament industry is less than that of the French; war reserves are very seriously deficient, and the fact that the bulk of the armament factories are close to the German frontier makes it impossible to rely upon their output in war. In 1938 neither France nor Belgium is likely to obtain much outside assistance as regards supplies of munitions.36. Against these considerations may be set the fact that French mobilisa-tion in 1938 would enable her to put approximately the same number of divisions as Germany in the field, whereas, by 1939, this will no longer be the case. France must also consider that her fixed land defences are now relatively as strong as they are ever likely to be, and looking ahead she may foresee the danger of military encirclement by three dictator Powers. None of these considerations, however, is likely to outweigh French determination not to seek war.37. Belgium&apos;s attitude is always purely defensive. The recent statement of her policy indicates a. desire to keep clear of commitments and guarantees, and to preserve her neutrality in a wax in the West of Europe. At the same time, Belgium is engaged in putting her defences in order; the completion of these will increase her chances of remaining neutral, an attitude which, from the military point of view, is to the advantage of France and ourselves.Economic.32. Growing difficulties over the balance of payments are progressively weakening Italian economic resources at the present time, and Mussolini has already resorted to the expedient of a capital levy. This appears to indicate that the strain of the Italian armament programme is already severe. Such a situation may contain the elements of danger, since if the economic situation deteriorates much further Mussolini may prefer to gamble upon the results of external adventure rather than face the effect of economic collapse in Italy. On the other hand, in war, Italy is vulnerable to economic pressure and her economic situation would become worse even than in peace as the result of joint action by the French and British, and, possibly, by Russia. In these circumstances Italy, like Germany, would hesitate to embark on war unless she sees a prospect of quick victory.Conclusion.33. If war is initiated by Germany, it would be in keeping with the character of Italy to attempt some form of blackmail before irrevocably committing herself to co-operation with Germany. If, however, she thought she could rely on Germany to defeat Great Britain, she herself would be only too pleased to exploit this circumstance in the Mediterranean and North-East Africa. In no other circumstances, however, except possibly for reasons of prestige, would Italy be likely to face the risk of war.
U.S.S.R.Armed Forces.38. Although the U.S.S.R. has very great man-power and large stocks of equipment, including aircraft, it is doubtful whether her military staff would consider her organisation sufficiently developed to enable her to embark on an offensive war with confidence. The Soviet forces have as yet made little progress in tactical training with the modern arms which they have acquired. The armament industry is still young and has fundamental weaknesses which influence output. In war it could not yet maintain for any length of time the maximum forces that the U.S.S.R. can mobilise, while the transportation system of the country, though improved, has not yet been developed to a pitch where it could stand the strain of anything but a snort war. The rebuilding of the Soviet Navy is still in its infancy except so far as submarines are concerned. It is considered that the Russian Air Force would rapidly deteriorate when it began to suffer heavy casualties, since, although there is an enormous so-called reserve of pilots, practically the whole of the personnel reserve is very poorly trained in all respects. This weakness is giving the Russian Staff much concern.Economic and industrial.39. Intervention in a war in which Germany, Italy and, possibly, Japan, . would be engaged against her would entail the loss of all the foreign trade normally passing through her Baltic and Far Eastern ports, and interference with her Black Sea ports. Her foreign trade is, however, on a small scale, even in peace, and the prospect of its loss would not be likely to deter the U.S.S.R. from war. There is no doubt that reserves of certain strategic raw materials have been accumulated, but there is little information from which to gauge their size.40. Above all, the internal situation in the U.S.S.R. has deteriorated to such an extent during the past year, as a result of political and industrial troubles, that she is unlikely in any circumstances to embark on an offensive war unless she is directly threatened.Part IV. CONCLUSIONS.41. Below we summarise the conclusions reached in this paper in relation to the situation, as we foresee it, in January 1938.(i) Great Britain, France and Belgium would be much stronger at sea than Germany and Italy, and would be able to exercise considerable economic pressure. Neither Germany nor Italy is likely to be in a strong financial or economic position, and the allied pressure would probably reduce them both to a very weak condition in the course of a long war. It is therefore unlikely that Germany or Italy, either singly or in conjunction, would embark on war unless they believed that they could achieve victory quickly.To make economic pressure effective within a reasonable time, it would be important for it to be applied immediately on the outbreak of hostilities, and for it to include an adequate system for the rationing of neutrals.(ii) The German Army will not have either the numbers, equipment or training to justify a belief that she could overrun France quickly. Even with the co-operation of Italy on the Franco-Italian frontier she would not be justified in anticipating a rapid decisive success on land.(iii) Although there have been indications that in some quarters the belief is held that success in war can be achieved by the exercise of air power alone, there is no proof that this represents German military opinion as a whole. Nevertheless, if internal difficulties should force her leaders to consider war as the only alternative to loss of prestige, they might decide to gamble upon the effect of air attack. The scale of her attack in 1938 would he lower than that of which she may be capable in 1939, but, on the other hand, she may become aware of our deficiencies in modern bomber aircraft and the backward state of our air defence measures and the industrial weakness of France.
(iv) The internal situation in the U.S.S.R. has deteriorated to such an extent during the past year as a result of political and industrial troubles that she is unlikely in any circumstances to intervene unless she is directly threatened.(v) In Paper No. C.O.S. 551 we referred to the possibility that Russianintervention on the side of the Allies might result in Japan supporting Germany and Italy. If this were so Russian intervention would, in fact, be an embarrassment rather than a help. It is difficult at any time to forecast with accuracy what policy Japan may pursue and her present preoccupations in China would not necessarily affect this uncertainty as to her action. In any event, the intervention of the U.S.S.R., while Poland and Czechoslovakia remained neutral, would confer little immediate benefit on the Allies&apos; cause. If Germany and Italy believed themselves justified in counting upon a quick decisive success against Prance or Great Britain, the fear of Soviet intervention would not, therefore, necessarily deter them from war.(vi) Italy might consider that alliance in war with Germany against GreatBritain would give her great opportunities in the Mediterranean and North-East Africa, although she must realise that the retention of any conquests she might make would depend on the ultimate result of the war. In no other circumstances, however, except possibly for reasons of prestige, would Italy be likely to face the risks of war.(vii) In considering their chances of success in war, Germany and Italy would probably take account not only of their own state of prepared-ness, but of the internal conditions in probable enemy States. We therefore regard the present internal conditions in France and Russia, and the consequent effect on the military strengths of those countries, as factors which increase the danger of war.42. From the above Report it will be seen that our Naval, Military and Air Forces, in their present stage of development, are still far from sufficient to meet our defensive commitments, which now extend from Western Europe through the Mediterranean to the Far East. Even to-day we could face without appre-hension an emergency either in the Far East or in the Mediterranean, provided that we were free to make preparations in time of peace and to concentrate sufficient strength in one or other of these areas. The lack of a defended Fleet base and dock in the Mediterranean, other than at Malta, is a serious deficiency; the defences and dockyard at Singapore are also uncompleted. So far as Germany is concerned, as our preparations develop, our defence forces will provide a considerable deterrent to aggression. But the outstanding feature of thf present situation is the increasing probability that a war started in any one of these three areas may extend to one or both of the other two. Without overlooking the assistance which we should hope to obtain from France, and possibly other allies, we cannot foresee the time when our defence forces will be strong enough to safeguard our territory, trade and vital interests against Germany, Italy and Japan simultaneously. We cannot, therefore, exaggerate the importance, from the point of view of Imperial defence, of any political or international action that can be taken to reduce the numbers of our potential enemies and to gain the support of potential allies.(Signed) CHATFIELD..

Italy has, besides her ports in the Mediterranean, a well-defended base accessible to capital ships at Massawa, and another base under construction at Asab, Eritrea, which should be completed in 1941.Our bases are adequate for a war against Germany, but for war with Italy we have no repair base with a capital ship dock in the Eastern Mediterranean, nor have we a defended anchorage in the Red Sea or at Aden capable of accommodating capital ships should it ever be necessary to send such ships through into the Red Sea. Facilities can be improvised at Alexandria to make that port suitable as an operational base for any class of ship. As regards local seaward defences, those for Rosyth, Scapa and east coast ports will be complete with the exception of A/B booms.The situation as regards facilities at Singapore is as follows : Singapore Base.   (For details regarding state of defences see page 19.)2. Under the Naval Deficiency Programme Singapore Dockyard should be completed, from the construction point of view, by the 1st April, 1939; the present Admiralty policy is to maintain the dockyard on a peace-time footing from that date onwards. By a peace-time footing is meant that the dockyard should in peace-time be capable of docking and undertaking refits of 9 cruisers a year.It cannot be said, however, that the peace-time status of the dockyard will exist before 1940, since it will probably take approximately one year from the date of completion to get the dockyard functioning properly.The dockyard should be capable of expansion from its peace-time status to the full war-time requirements within a period of six months.Situation in January 1938.3. Repairs. The work that could be carried out in the Singapore Dockyard in January 1938 would be limited to very &quot; minor repairs &quot; since little of the machinery will have been installed in the workshops by that time. However, with the aid of H.M.S. Resource and the facilities of Singapore Harbour Board, the
normal work of maintaining a moderate size fleet at Singapore could be met, but no after action repairs could be carried out, nor could any purely naval work in the nature of gun mounting, fire control work, alterations and additions, &amp;c, b) carried out.4. Docking. The position as regards docking in the event of the fleet having to operate from Singapore is satisfactory. The Graving Dock at the Naval Base has been completed, and, although the channel at the entrance has not yet been fully dredged, any existing ship could now be docked at high water. The dredging, which will enable ships to be docked at any state of the tide, will be completed by March 1938.There are at Singapore a number of commercial docks belonging to the Singapore Harbour Board capable of docking cruisers, destroyers and submarines. There is also a small dock at Penang which can dock destroyers and submarines. Under a skeleton programme which has been prepared to allow for the docking of the British main fleet under conditions of a Far Eastern War, all destroyers and submarines and a certain percentage of cruisers are shown as docking in these commercial docks.Anti-aircraft ammunition for H.M. Ships.5. The following Table shows the position as regards Anti-aircraft ammunition on the 1st January, 1938. It shows that there will be certain minor deficiencies on that date : Anti-Aircraft Ammunition for H.M. Ships.Anticipated position as on January 1, 1938.Type of H.A. Gun.

The table should be read in conjunction with the notes on each country which are given in the following pages, since the comparative value of a division depends upon its state of training and equipment.Notes.Germany (!) Includes 3 armoured divisions. (3) Includes 15 reserve divisions.(3) Includes 24 Landwehr divisions, armed on a lower scale than the active and reserve divisions.(*) Includes 16 reserve and 24 Landwehr divisions. (5) Includes 18 reserve and 24 Landwehr divisionsItaly-(!) Includes 5 Alpine, 3 mobile and 2 motorised divisions on mainland, and 4 divisions, two of which are motorised, permanently quartered in Libya.France (&apos;) Includes 1 cavalry and 2 light mechanised divisions.(2) Includes 3 cavalry, 2 light mechanised, 4 North African and 4 colonial divisions. (3) Includes 5 mobile, 20 active, 20 1st Reserve and 10 North African or colonial divisions. Though France could mobilise this number, it is doubtful if she could maintain more than 40 for any length of time (vide paragraph 30 of this Appendix). (4) Includes a further 6-8 divisions from abroad. Belgium (i) Mobile Division (Chasseurs Ardennais). Great Britain -(i) Plus certain other troops available for reinforcement of garrisons, but not susceptible of grouping into divisions (vide paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Appendix).U.S.S.R.-(!) Includes 2 mechanised divisions.(2) Includes a third mechanised division.(3) These figures would be modified only if U.S.S.R. were simultaneously taking the offen-sive in the Far Bast (vide paragraph 34 of this Appendix.)Comparison of Land Forces, January 1938.1. In Table B we have made a comparison of the land forces of the six Powers with which this paper deals as we anticipate they will be in January 1938. In tabular form this comparison can give only a rough indication of comparative strengths; . the table is therefore followed by notes giving greater detail about the condition of the land forces of each Power.Great Britain. Field Troops in the United Kingdom.2. The maximum force which could be mobilised as a complete formation for service overseas is one corps of two divisions (see paragraph 6 in body of the Paper). The corps, &amp;c, troops include one Armoured Car Regiment, one Light Tank Battalion, one A.A. Group and the necessary L. of C. units for maintaining the force as well as an L. of. C. Infantry Brigade : after three months of war a Cavalry Light Tank Regiment might become available in addition.
It would, furthermore, be possible to mobilise many other fighting units for home defence and the reinforcement of garrisons overseas, but the lack of equipment and the essential R.E., R.A.S.C., R.A.O.C., &amp;c, units prevents these fighting units from being grouped into higher formations. The principal units outside the Intermediate Contingent which are available in the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland District) are : Eight Infantry Brigades each of three Rifle Battalions. Six M.G. Battalions.Eleven Field Brigades R.A. (but all could not be equipped). Two A.A. Brigades R.A. (but see paragraph 7 below). Three Divisions Signals.3. The Cavalry is in process of reorganising and most of the reservists are insufficiently trained.As regards R.E., there are none available after filling the Intermediate Contingent.The reorganisation of the regular Infantry at home will be nearing completion.The Royal Tank Corps have the equivalent of five battalions in personnel, excluding requirements for wastage, but see paragraph 6 below as regards equipment.R.A.S.C., R.A.O.C. and R.A.M.C. have minor elements available in excess of the Intermediate Contingents requirements. These would probably suffice only for the maintenance of some fighting units sent to reinforce garrisons overseas.4. The Mobile Division. The two mechanised cavalry brigades would be unfit for war, but after Z 4- 90 days it might be possible to provide a single light tank cavalry regiment from the total available resources of mechanized cavalry (see paragraph 2 above).5. The Tank Brigade will be equipped with medium tanks which are obsolete and unfit for war, but the light tank battalion will be equipped with modern light tanks, for which reserves will be available.6. The two army tank battalions at home will not be equipped for war. A third will be in process of forming in Egypt and a fourth will be raised in May 1938, but equipment for none of them will be available before 1939.7. The personnel of the two regular A.A. groups could produce one complete A.A. group plus two A.A. Brigades R.A. By the 1st January, 1938, however, equipment would be available for only one of these additional Brigades. A full second A.A. group could not be manned with trained personnel before Z -I- 90 days.8. Twelve Territorial Army divisions will be under strength, will possess no modern equipment and will be entirely deficient in war reserves.9. Equipment. In January 1938 units of the Intermediate Contingent will be deficient in the following modern equipment: Equipment. January 1, 1938.

The figures given for ammunition include reserves. The first-line trans-port will be fully mechanised. The light tanks of the units mentioned in paragraph 2 above, namely, of the Light Tank Battalion R.T.C. and the Single Cavalry Light Tank Regiment, are the only type of tank available.
Air Defence of Great Britain.12. Units. Of the 76 A.A. batteries and 108 A.A. Companies authorized, all will have been formed, but of these, 15 batteries and 13 companies will be newly converted and will be virtually untrained.AH units will be considerably under strength.13. Equipment. Of the 608 A.A. guns required, 176 3-inch, complete with Case III gear and instruments, should have been delivered, leaving a deficiency of 432 guns. (There will, however, be a further 48 3-inch in the regular A.A. groups.)Of the 2,547 searchlights required, 1,000 should have been delivered, leaving a deficiency of 1,547 searchlights.The above equipment will be largely dispersed amongst the units to give them adequate training facilities. In an emergency there would be about 100 guns available for the defence of the London area and about 800 searchlights. The latter would suffice to complete the present Inner Artillery Zone (approxi-mately a radius of 10 miles from Charing Cross) and the sectors of the Aircraft Fighting Zone covering London from the north, east and south.Elsewhere at ports and in the industrial areas there would be about 70 guns and 200 lights. These could probably best be distributed to form &quot; token &quot; defences at the various places for which defence is provided under the A.D.G.B. scheme.The regular AA. groups (vide paragraph 7 above) if not sent overseas would also be available to reinforce A.D.G.B.By the 1st January, 1938, we should have 360,000 rounds of 3-inch A.A. ammunition available in Great Britain for all purposes. By the 1st April, 1938. this amount will have increased to 465,000 rounds. This is considered adequate for the few guns available.Coast Defence of Great Britain and Ireland.14. Existing close defences will be comparatively satisfactory, but a good deal of the ammunition will still be of obsolete pattern.The new defences which it is proposed to install at Scapa and Invergordon will not be ready, and it is doubtful whether any ports will have 6 pdr. anti-motor torpedo-boat defences.None of the counter-bombardment defences will have be^n modernized.10. Reserves. Reserves of modern weapons except Mortars would be totally deficient and the ammunition for weapons in paragraph 9 above will only be available to the extent there shown.Field artillery ammunition sufficient for operations at Continental rates of expenditure would be available for the Intermediate Contingent until post-war production overtook war expenditure. For the artillery of units of the regular army, not included in the Intermediate Contingent, no ammunition could be pro-vided, until Z + 90 days when ammunition could be made available for the artillery of a third division and one Army Field Brigade, RA.For operations elsewhere than on the Continent, e.g., in the Middle East, field artillery ammunition would suffice either for a longer time or for a larger quantity of artillery.11. Petrol. The supply of petrol for any force which may be despatched to a theatre of war before the Llandarcy Filling Factory is in production cannot be regarded as satisfactory. The present estimate is that the Llandarcy Factory will not be in production before February 1938. Up to that date the only pro-vision which can be made for the supply of petrol would entail the collection of such cans and containers as are available in the country. It is understood that in no case would these maintain more than one division at Continental rates of expenditure. In the Near East the expenditure of petrol is considerably higher than in Europe, but tinning facilities exist in Egypt with a high potential output which can be made available at about 14 days&apos; notice provided stocks of tin plate are adequate.

Apart from the Covering Force and Internal Security Troops, the Field Army consists of four divisions (mixed Indian and British Units). Of these, one might perhaps be available for employment outside India in emergency.Red Sea and Indian Ocean.17.

One British battalion is temporarily in China, but a battalion is standing by in India to replace it in event of emergency.Schemes exist for the despatch of a Brigade Group from India to reinforce Singapore by Z 4- 12 days and/or of a battalion from Burma to arrive by Z -I- 5 days.[16111] - e
(d) War Reserves.The proportion of the approved scales of war reserves which will exist in Singapore in January 1938 are as follows : 15-inch up to approved scale for guns mounted.9 - 2-inch up to approved scale.6-inch approved scale (more than half old type).3-inch up to approved scale.S.A.A. up to approved scale.Defence Scheme stores complete.Anti-gas stores.

At present, owing to the Sino-Japanese crisis, two of the Battalions normally at Hong Kong have been moved temporarily to Shanghai, but have been replaced by one battalion from Singapore and one from India.(d) War Reserves.Gun ammunition up to authorised scale, but all old type.

Australia could produce two infantry brigade groups for garrison duty by about Z 4- 37 days, and New Zealand and Canada could also produce small forces for garrison duty, if required, in about Z + 2 months.Larger contingents, fit to take the field, would not be ready before Z -t 6 months at the earliest, and. would be dependent on United Kingdom resources for a great deal of their equipment. Approximate strengths would be as follows : Canada. One cavalry division, two divisions and corps troops. A australia. One cavalry brigade, one division.New Zealand. One mounted rifle brigade, one infantry brigade group.The above figures, although the latest received from Dominions, are largely hypothetical and should be accepted with reserve.
Germany.23. The 39 German divisions, being permanently at approximate war strength, should be ready to leave peace stations by Z 4- 1 day.There will probably be reserves of equipment sufficient to equip 15 reserve divisions on the same scale as the active divisions, and these divisions should be ready to leave peace stations by Z 4- 4 days. Also 24 Landwehr divisions equipped on a lower scale will be ready to take over frontier defence by Z 4- 6 days.By January 1938 it is anticipated that the equipment of the 39 active divisions and the 15 reserve divisions will be completed with the possible exception of medium and heavy tanks. Owing to a shortage of trained officers the training of these divisions is still likely to fall short of the high standard which the German General Staff consider necessary for war.24. Unless German construction of heavy tanks has already been carried out in secret on a large scale, she will not in January 1938 possess tank units of a type or in the numbers necessary to give her a prospect of breaking through the French or Belgian frontier fortifications by means of A.F.Vs.25. It is known to be Germany&apos;s aim to organize behind each active infantry division a first and second line reserve division.By January 1938 it is estimated that 15 of these first line reserve divisions can be put into the field equipped on the same scale as the active divisions and that this number can be increased at the rate of just over one division per month.It is, however, impossible to foresee what form the further expansion of the German Army will take after the declaration of war.In addition, by January 1938, further progress will have been made in training the 24 Landwehr divisions to protect the frontiers and hold quieter parts of the front and so relieve active and reserve divisions for service elsewhere.Italy.26. The speed with which Italian divisions could be mobilised in January 1938 will depend on the extent to which personnel called up in connection with the Abyssinian war are retained with the colours. The figures given in Table &quot; B &quot; assume that no change in Italian policy will be made between now and then.27. The armament of the Italian Army is thoroughly modern and considerable reserves are held.Owing, perhaps, to the mountainous character of Italy&apos;s land frontiers, her scale of anti-tank weapons is comparatively low. Though her tanks are numerous, the majority are of a poor type more fitted for use as an armoured machine gun carrier than as a tank proper. Her scale of A.A. defence weapons is very low. and her infantr)&apos; are not taught defence against low-flying aircraft by small arms fire.28. The possibility of an Italian attack on Egypt has been increased by the formation of two Metropolitan Corps in Libya consisting of a total of 4 divisions (2 of which are motorised).France.29. France relies for much of her strength in defence against Germany upon her fortifications, which cannot be expressed in terms of divisions. This factor is not fully represented in the tabular comparison of forces. Her defences on the German frontier are already complete and those on her Belgian frontier are now being strengthened, but will not be completed before the end of 1938.30. Without industrial assistance from some other Power France could not maintain the 53 divisions which her man-power and initial supplies of equipment would enable her to mobilise by Z 4- 21. It is doubtful whether she could maintain a force of more than 40 field divisions for any length of time.It seems unlikely that France could, in 1938, count on industrial help from any foreign Power; but, although she might have difficulty in maintaining 53 divisions for any length of time, it is believed that she would mobilise that number.
Belgium.31. Of the 12 infantry divisions which would be mobilised by Z 4 4, &apos;6 would be reserve formations which would be of limited fighting value for the first few weeks of their embodiment.As, however, a second batch of 6 reserve divisions will be mobilised and available for garrison duties in the rear and for the construction of field defences, all the 15 divisions shown in Table B will be actually available for active operations.32. Like Prance, Belgium relies upon fortifications as well as field forma-tions. Their fortifications at Namur, Liege and Antwerp, although not as formidable as the Prench Maginot line, are of considerable strength and are linked up by a system of concrete machine gun posts behind water obstacles. The Albert Canal defences will be reasonably strong by &quot;January 1938, but the Canal itself will not be completed by that date.33. The capacity of the Belgian armament industry will still be quite insignificant and she would have to rely upon outside sources for the supply of armaments if she mobilises her full number of divisions.It is difficult to see whence in fact Belgium would be able to obtain the necessary reserves in view of the parallel shortage in England and Prance and the United States embargo on the export of armaments to belligerents.U.S.S.R.34. The number of divisions shown in Table B would be modified only if the U.S.S.R. were at the same time engaged in offensive operations in the Far East, in which case she might earmark 10 divisions in European Russia for service in the Far East. The number of divisions available for service on her western front at Z + 30 would then be 85, and by Z -\- 90 the number would have reached 115.35. Although the Soviet army consists for the most part of cavalry and infantry equipped with horsed transport, considerable progress has been made in the development of mechanised formations. The whole organisation is still apparently in a state of flux but the Red Army now possesses at least 6,000 tanks of all types, of which their Medium Christie is believed to be the best of its type in the world.36. Russia is developing several unusual features which are likely to characterise her land operations.She is very &quot; gas-minded &quot; and has a complete organisation for the offensive use of gas in war which, despite her signature of the Geneva Protocol, she may be expected to use from the outset.She contemplates the use of &quot; storm &quot; aircraft for low-flying attack, by bomb or machine gun, against troops assembling for attack or upon the march and against headquarters and communications.She also trains aircraft and troops to land small mixed forces by parachute behind the enemy lines.The most intimate strategical and tactical co-operation is visualised between land and air forces.The Russian army is organised politically both to ensure the reliability of the troops and to carry out intensive subversive propaganda in occupied territory and in the ranks of the opposing armies.Though no reliable estimate of the value of these features can be made they will probably improve the previously low offensive value of Russian troops.On the other hand, the recent &quot; purge&quot; in the armed forces, the institution of military councils to control the actions of commanders-in-chief and the restoration of their former powers to the military commissars must have had a serious adverse effect on the value for war of the Russian Army.

Comparative Air Strength as at January 1, 1938. British and Dominion Air Forces.Great Britain.1. The policy of the Government for the expansion of the Royal Air Force involved two phases first, the expansion of our first-line strength to an approved figure at the earliest possible date with any aircraft that were available and secondly, a phase of re-equipment with up-to-date aircraft and the provision of reserves.The date at which this statement has been called for falls only about six months after the completion of the first phase. It is therefore inevitable that it should find us in an unsatisfactory&apos;position in respect of the number of squadrons that can be mobilised on a sound basis of readiness for war that is, backed by that scale of war reserves which is considered essential to replace wastage in the initial stages.2. In the event of war breaking out in January 1938, there would be two extreme courses open to us :  (a) We could place in the field the full number of squadrons comprised in the peace strength of the Royal Air Force irrespective of their state of operational efficiency and backed by little or no reserve.(&amp;) We could mobilize only that number of squadrons which we estimate we could maintain in action at full strength, by using the aircraft of the remaining squadrons as war reserves, until such time as the output from industry overtook war wastage.The first of these extremes would be obviously unsound, while the second would be difficult and uneconomical, and would reduce our initial war effort to an extent which would, in practice, be unacceptable.3. Instead, therefore of assessing our mobilisable strength upon the basis of providing a war reserve of 150 per cent, behind our first-line strength which was the basis of assessment for our Bomber Squadrons in Paper No. CCS. 551  it has been decided that until the second phase of Air Force expansion is complete, we should base our mobilisation arrangements upon a compromise between the above extremes. For the pi&apos;esent, the arrangement is that, generally speaking,,squadrons equipped with new types shall be considered as mobilisable, provided they have 33 per cent, of reserve aircraft, and that the new type of aircraft has been in the squadron for not less than one month. Where, however, squadrons such as our light bombers are equipped with an obsolescent type of aircraft which is no longer in production, there will be 150 per cent, reserve behind the first line. The figures for British aircraft shown in Tables C and D above have, therefore, been compiled on this basis.4. In January 1938, however, the output of our aircraft factories will only be about 200 aircraft per month, including training types. It is clear, therefore, that the total of 1,053 aircraft, which we show as our mobilisable first-line strength, could not be maintained for more than a very short period if our estimate of the rate of wastage, based upon war experience and a reasonable estimate of modern developments proves correct.5. For the reason given in paragraphs 1-4 above, we could not maintain our bomber and fighter squadrons at the strength given in the tables, if we were forced to go to war early in 1938. There are additional difficulties mainly centreing round the supply of turrets and &quot; Browning&quot; guns which might also limit the operational strength of our bomber and fighter squadrons. In general, maintenance stores held behind the older types of aircraft which are now out of production are sufficient to maintain the squadrons until the reserves of aircraft are exhausted. As regards the newer types of aircraft, maintenance stores are only just becoming available, and by the 1st January, 1938, will still be inadequate to maintain squadrons on a war basis.Due to the present lack of aircraft depots in the United Kingdom the repair organisation is totally inadequate for war. Should it be necessary to despatch a contingent to the Continent, the efficiency of any repair and maintenance organisation accompanying it will be of a low order;
Many of the facilities required for the proper distribution of ammunition in war will still be under construction at the date in question. The initial supply of bombs and ammunition to stations, and its maintenance once hostilities have started, will therefore be a difficult problem.There will be a serious shortage of anti-gas stores and anti-gas measures generally will not be satisfactory. Such difficulties are, however, almost inseparable from a period of rapid expansion and re-equipment, and may be expected to be surmounted in course of time. There is no reason to suppose that foreign Air Forces are immune from troubles of this kind.6. By January 1938 the Dominions will possess some 300 aircraft, but a great number of these will consist of obsolescent types. The formation of aircraft factories in the Dominions will not have reached a stage in which they could render much assistance in the early stages of a war. The chief value of the Dominions, therefore, lies in their almost unlimited potential for supplying pilots and other personnel, and the fact that in a long war their geographical situation will enable training and manufacturing facilities to be established in an area free from any possibility of interference from hostile air attack.7. The above picture of our state of readiness for war discloses many unsatisfactory circumstances, but it must be realised that the Royal Air Force is now in the midst of a most difficult stage of transition. We are in the process of expanding from a small force which mainly consisted of light single-engined aircraft to a large force equipped with aircraft which are in many cases multi-engined, and all of which have a high performance and completely different characteristics from those on which the bulk of the Air Force has been trained. Our squadrons are manned very largely by personnel who though enthusiastic and efficient are yet necessarily lacking in experience and higher training. It is no doubt true that more rapid progress in rearmament is possible in a totalitarian state, particularly if it is pursued at the expense of all other considerations. Nevertheless, we consider that some of our own difficulties both in respect of equipment and training must also apply in the case of Germany and Italy.Germany.8. Germany must be assumed to be better off for reserves than ourselves, as her factory output at present is estimated to be not less than 500 aircraft per month. In assessing her first-line strength, therefore, we have assumed that it will be backed by approximately 100 per cent, war reserve. This admittedly can only be an &quot;instructed guess,&quot; but the productive potential of her aircraft industry in war (itself a vitally important form of reserve) is bound to be very much higher than ours in January 1938.This does not necessarily imply that Germany now considers herself ready for war. The official disclosure by Germany of certain statistics, together with other information obtained from Intelligence sources, has enabled the Air Staff to forecast a probable programme for the German Air Force with considerably more accuracy than was possible when Paper No. C.O.S. 551 was drafted. There is now strong reason to believe that Germany is aiming at a strength of 3,240 first-line aircraft, backed by adequate i-eserves, by the end of 1939; as compared with our 1,736 first-line Metropolitan strength, for which provision is made in the programme on which we have so far been engaged. Germany&apos;s present strength of 1,820, therefore, indicates no higher standard of preparedness relative to her ultimate strength than our own figure of 1,053; moreover there is no doubt that Germany suffers in some degree from difficulties consequent upon re-equipment and expansion similar to those in the British Service. Fuller details regarding the German Air Force were circulated in a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on the 6th July, .1937.Italy.9. During the period between May 1937 and January 1938 Italy will have been engaged in re-equipping her first-line strength with new types of aircraft and reorganising her aircraft factories rather than concentrating upon a further first-line expansion.This was rendered necessary by the unsatisfactory output from her engine factories which would seriously have limited the first-line strength she could have maintained if she had resorted to war in the Summer of 1937.   To some extent
she has now overcome this difficulty, but it is doubtful whether the output of the Italian aircraft industry will exceed 300 aircraft per month by the 1st January, 1938.Italy does not appear to have changed her original programme, which aims at an ultimate strength of 2,000 first-line aircraft backed by adequate reserves, so that, in common with Germany and ourselves, she will still be in the process of expanding her air force in January 1938.France.10. The first-line strength of the French Metropolitan Air Force has increased by about 15 per cent, since May 1937. The state of her aircraft industry has, however, seriously deteriorated even since the last Memorandum on the French Air Force was circulated on the 7th July, 1937, and it is very doubtful whether she could in fact maintain-her first-line strength for any length of time in a major war. There are, moreover, indications that the fighting value of the French Air Force at the present time is not of a high standard.Belgium.11, The Belgian figures given are those for her peace time first-line strength. The British Air Attache reports that it is doubtful whether her true mobilisable strength is as large as 75 per cent, of this figure. She possesses reserves amounting to some 25 per cent, of her peace-time strength, but her aircraft industry is quite inadequate for her war requn-ements.Russia.12. Russia will have a ponderous Air Force, and new equipment will replace gradually the slower aircraft. It is likely that the high first-line strength figure would be reduced considerably after a few weeks of war and would stabilise on a very much lower figure than it now is. &apos; Transportation and skilled labour difficulties would probably reduce the present scale of attack to a lower level. We estimate the Russian reserves of aircraft to be about 75 per cent.
