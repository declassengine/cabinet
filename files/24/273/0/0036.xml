(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC HAJESTIrt S GOVERIffiiEIIT)!?. 311(57)ECEBICABINET Divorce and Nullity of Marriage (Scotland) Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.Copy No.Lord Alness has re-introduced in a slightly modified form the Divorce and Hullity of Marriage (Scotland) Bill which passed through all its stages in the House of Lords last Session.     The Bill has received a Second Reading and the indications are that it will pass through its remaining stages in the Lords without substantial alteration.In connection with the proceedings on last year&apos;s Bill the Scottish Office representative in the House of Lords was authorised merely to explain the consequences which would arise on one side or the other from the proposals in the Bill, and no indication of the Government&quot; s attitude was given. (Cabinet 2(57) Conclusion 7) . Circumstances have now altered to some extent inasmuch as the E nglish Matrimonial Causes Act of last Session has now become law, said the Scottish Bill, as now intro-duced, proposes to bring the law as to the grounds of divorce in Scotland into conformity with that now in operation in England.I have endeavoured to ascertain what Scottish feeling in relation to the Bill is and, so far as I can judge, its proposals command a wide measure of support *     The Church of Scotland has not reached any considered conclusion and there is a lilceli-hood of some division of opinion among the presbyteries.     This, however, is not a matter of surprise in view of the subject of the Bill, and I do not think that serious opposition to its proposals need he anticipated.My own view, in which the Lord Advocate concurs, is that the Bill in its present form would effect a desirable amendment of the existing law and that accordingly no obstacle should be put in the way of its reaching the Statute Book.     I would suggest, therefore, that, in the event of the Bill being given a Second Reading in the House of Commons, the Government should co-operate in the proceedings in Committee by explaining its provision and their consequences, and generally in securing that the Bill remains in a suitable form for inclusion in the Statute Book.     I would further propose that - following the Cabinet decision in the case of the English Bill of last Session (Cabinet 20(37) Conclusion 7) - Government time should, if necessary, be made available for its remaining stages.th Dcceiber, 1937.w.e.e.
