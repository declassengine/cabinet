(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNl\&apos;IENT ) .COPY No.38-secret.CP. No. 290/37.CABINET india appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India, dated 26th November,  1937.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 26th November, 1937, issued on the authority of the Secretary ox State for India.The Noi-th-7/est  rentier.        The situation in Waziristan has improved, minor incidents continue but the troops have encountered little serious opposition.     In the middle of October a hostile gang of Tori Ehel Wazirs and some Afghan subjects captured a Khassadar post on the Mirali-Spinwam road;    the troops moved out and engaged the gang in an operation which was completely successful.      3 Indian other ranks were killed and one Indian officer and 12 Indian other ranks wounded.      Of the hostile gang,  12 dead were recovered and 8 rifles captured.      The whereabouts of the Faqir of Ipi is uncertain, he is believed to be somewhere near the Afghan border in the extreme north of Waziristan.     Road construction progresses well and some roads in Shaktu and Khalsora are nearly complete.      Troops have advanced into Bhitanni country from the Bannu district;    preliminary opposition quickly disappeared and the construction of a road into the heart of the country is proceeding.     All the Hindus kidnapped by the Bhitannis have been returned.2.    The All-India Congress Committee.      The first meeting of the Committee since the acceptance of office by Congress took place at Calcutta at the end of October.      Thanks to the influence of&quot; Mr. Gandhi in the preliminary meetings of the Working Committee the resolutions passed represented,  on the whole, the views of the Eight Wing, but the proceedings showed the increasing strength and aggressiveness of the socialist opposition.      While the permission given by the Working Committee in July for acceptance of office was duly ratified, there was a strong disposition, with which Nehru is known to sympathise, to assert the right of the Congress Executive to criticise and control Congress
Ministries, several of which found themselves on their defence for their slowness in giving effect to the Congress policy.      In particular, the Madras Ministry came under severe criticism for its sanction to the prosecution of an agitator for sedition:   but after a general discussion on law and order the action of the Madras Ministry was approved and the principle was affirmed that direct incitements to violence could not be tolerated.The discussion had some value in drawing public attention to the impossible situation in which ministers would find themselves if they were subjected to constant interference in details of their administration,  and it is likely that an attempt will now be made to define more clearly the scope of their freedom of action, more particularly in matters of law and order.!To other very notable decisions were taken at the meeting, a discussion on the possibility of preventing the elections to the Federal Legislature proved discouraging and the resolution passed merely reaffirmed the hostility ox Congress towards Federation without indicating any definite plan of action.      The Left wing managed to secure the passing of a resolution with reference to the recent happenings in Mysore, asserting that the people of British India should combine with the people of the States in the struggle for freedom, but this was contrary to the. general policy of the Congress, and Mr. Gandhi lias since disavowed it.Another resolution was passed stating that, while Congress disapprove of the communal award, they do not intend to alter it save by common consent.      This was apparently meant to pacify the Moslems but is discounted by the fact that Congress show no signs of slackening their
&quot;mass contact&quot; movement for the enlistment ox Moslems.3*    The Muslim league.    An important meeting of the league was held at Lucknow in the latter part of October. Mr.  Jinnah, the President, uttered a strong indictment of Congress, affirming that their leaders had alienated the Moslems by pursuing an exclusively Hindu policy and indicating that the results will be class bitterness, communal war and the strengthening of the Imperial hold over India.      He declared that Moslems can expect neither justice nor fair play under Congress Government and that no settlement between them is possible.The Premier of the PunjabNannounced his decision to advise all Moslem members of the Unionist Party in the Punjab to join the League and sign its creed.      This move was as surprising as it was important,  as previous approaches from Mr.  Jinnah had been turned down by the Unionist Party.      The Bengal Premier subsequently issued a similar statement of adherence to the League.      The League has undoubtedly gained strength as a result  of these decisions and is making rapid strides in extending its organisation.      The result may be to accentuate communal bitterness, but the appearance in the political field of a new and powerful All-India Party would do much to qualify the monopoly, which Congress, by the virtue of their superior organisation have hitherto enjoyed.     In the meantime, in order to compete with Congress for the support of the younger section, the League has agreed to adopt &quot;full independence&quot; as its aim.      A resolution expressing disapproval of the scheme of All-India Federation was also passed, and another condemning the proposed partition of Palestine.The first real struggle between the forces of Oongre
and. the League was the by - election at Bijnor in the United Provinces, where a. Congress Minister (who had been originally elected on the Muslim League ticket and had resigned his seat on going over to Congress) stood in opposition to a League nominee.      The result was a convincing victory for the Congress candidate.      It Is stated that the communal issue was not prominent;    the superior organisation of Congress and the Minister&apos;s personal influence were responsible for his success. Three more by - elections are shortly to be contested between Congress and League candidates in the United Provinces.In the Punjab there was a certain amount of uneasiness amongst the Sikhs and Hindus over the pact entered into by the Premier with the Muslim League.      Indications are that the agreement will have little effect on the Government following in the Legislature, though it is likely to draw more closely together theopposition elements.      Possible effects are greater solidarity within each of the three communities and a clear demarcation of forces hostile or favourable to Congress.Communal.      The great Hindu festival Dussehra passed off peacefully in most pi&apos;ovinces,  although there was communal tension in Bihar and in the Punjab, where a number of minor incidents occurred;    a serious outbreak occurred in. Jubbulpore in the Central Provinces where assaults and rioting resulted in injuries to about 120 persons;    the authorities controlled the situation and there has been n o x ui&apos; t he r t r o ub 1 e .5.    Law and Order.      The subject of the release of political prisoners and detenus and of prisoners repatriate from the Andamans is still being pursued by Congress.      As
result of discussions between Mr. Gandhi and the Bengal Ministry,.the latter have now agreed to accelerate the policy of the. release of detenus.      The existing restrictions on 1,100 persons now on probation are being removed at once,  and cases of others will he examined in the near future, provided the present improved atmosphere is maintained.      Mr. Gandhi has promised to co-operate in this work by interviewing and obtaining assurances from individual detenus.Two terrorist prisoners have been released in Madras and 15 in Bihar.      The Bombay Government have released 6 prisoners who were sentenced to transportation for life in connection with the riots in 1919,  and have cancelled certain bans against communist organisations;    but they have made it clear that they intend to ensure an atmosphere of non-violence and that, if attempts are made to endanger the peace, they will carry out their duty of maintaining law and ox^der.     In the united Provinces the efforts which have been made for some time past by less responsible elements of Congress in combine with local communists to demoralise the police,  culminated in an &quot;anti-police day&quot; at Cawnpore on October 24th.     Violent speeches were made at public meetings, including incitements to murder the police.      While such demonstrations are not countenanced by the Ministry, or even by Nehru, the Ministry appear to be afraid or unwilling to use their power to curb these activities which, following a period of particular anxiety and difficulty, must have an unateadying effect on the morale of the police,6,     The agrarian situation.      The relations between tenants and landowners, and the widespread agitation which is being worked up, largely by Congress extremists and communists, among peasant organisations, continue to give
cause for anxiety. The tendency to withold payment of rent is spreading. In Bihar, police had to be sent to one district to restore peace;    in Bombay peasants areexplained that this is at present impossible.      In the United Provinces.the land-owners are up in arms against the Congress Government and at a conference at Lucknow they condemned the Ministries&apos; policy of allowing Congress interference in the administration.      In this province also, tenants are said to be adopting violent methods to re-occupy land from which they have been legally ejected.1.      Communists and. Labour.      Communist agitation amongst labour has succeeded in bringing about more strikes. The threat of a general strike still hangs over Bombay and communists have be&apos;en creating unrest amongst the textile workers in Khandesh with a view to enlisting their aid in Bombay;    they also engineered strikes in Ahmedabad, Sholapur and Kalyan.      In Cawnpore the situation has not improved; the more moderate elements have lost their influence and mill committees practically control labour.      The threatened strike of the Electric Supply Corporation in Calcutta has not materialised, the &quot;Onion officials having persuaded the workers to await the findings of the Negotiations Committee.An interesting explanation of the intentions of the communists in India has been made by one leader who stated that they will be trying to g2t a majority in the Congress party and then eliminate the more moderate &quot;Gandhi element&quot;. Owing to the removal of restrictions on the press in the United Provinces, communists have adopted a policy of publishing newspapers in this Province to escape the restrictions enforced in others,  e.g. the Punjab.      A new communistic organ displaying the hammer and sickle as itsdemanding an immediate moratorium.The Minister has
heading has appeared in Cawnpore; it is expected that similar evasions of the lav? will take place.8.    Economic.      There are prospects of a successful harvest in east, south and central India but lack of rain in the north gives cause for anxiety lest sowings fail.
