(THIS DOCUMENT IS TnE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJLSTY&apos;S GOVERliliENT).SECRET.1.      For some time my attention, and that of the Law Officers, ^as &quot;been directed to the evils which appear to arise from the operation of the Hire Purchase system.      Frequent questions ^ave &quot;been asked in the House of Commons on this subject, and both from them and from other evidence it ^as become apparent t^at the subject requires the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2.      With the Law Officers I was at the commencement of the present session engaged in considering the question of setting up a departmental committee to enquire into these alleged evils, and to propose remedies for them.3.      Some few weeks ago, however, I became aware that the more responsible firms engaged in this work were in negotiation with those principally interested on behalf of the general body of purchasers with a view to promoting legislation upon the subject. The vendors were represented in this negotiation by the Hire Purchase Association, of which the chairman is Sir Harold Bellman, who is also well-known in the Building Society world and is managing director of the Abbey Road Building Society. It is not known who represented the purchasers;    but negotiations were conducted at Toynbee Hall and with the assistance of Mr. J. Mallon, the warden of that institution.      As a resultCP.   294 (57).CABINET.HIRE PURCHASE BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.-1-
of these negotiations, a draft Bill has &quot;been agreed, between those taking part, and the Second Reading of this Bill will be moved by Miss Wilkinson on Friday next. 4.      While the Bill represer.&apos;&quot;.s agreement between the parties attending the conference, there are probably other firms who did not take any part in it, and who might be expected to be hostile to its proposals.      Furthermore, the Incorporated Society of Auctioneers and the National Farmers&apos; Union appear to be in opposition to some features of the Bill.      It is understood that recently there have been great developments in the sale and purchase of livestock under a hire purchase system, and the two societies last named appear to consider that the Bill does not take sufficient account of these developments.      It is expected, therefore, that Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith will oppose, or at least criticise, the provisions of the Bill on Second Reading.      On the other hand, Mr. Turton, who represents an agricultural constituency, is one of those whose names appear on the back of the Bill.5.      I have, therefore, communicated with the Ministry of Agriculture.      I understand from them that the Minister is greatly interested in any proposal touching the hire purchase system in its relation to agriculture.      I have communicated, to him an advance copy of this memorandum, but the time available, since I learned so far as I have been able to ascertain the attitude of the Auctioneers and of the Farmers&apos; Union, has been so short that the Minister has had no substantial opportunity of expressing his views. I might point out, however,  that, as will hereafter appear, the provisions of the Bill are limited to purchases of not more than  50 in value for any one article, or of not more than  100 in value when several articles are comprised in
the same transaction.     Probably hire purchase agreements for the purchase of livestock would, in most cases, be in excess of these figures, and the Bill, therefore, probably does not touch either for good or for evil agricultural transactions.      It may be that those who regard the hire purchase system as having peculiar demerits when used for agricultural purposes object to the Bill on the ground . t^at the financial limits are too closely restricted. 6.     The evils of t^e hire purchase system may be summarised as follows:-(a) The goods are sold at an excessive price which is concealed in the agreement for payment by instalments.(b) The purchaser is jiot profce-cte-d by the warranties Which are implied by t^e Sale of Goods Act in a sale, and the door is open for t^e supply of goods of very low quality in relation to t^e price.(c) T^e hire purchase agreement contains &quot;hars^i terras enabling the vendor to enter and seize the goods When an instalment is in arrear.(d) The purchaser, who is in effect the borrower, when he makes default loses both the goods, which are in effect the vendor&apos;s security, and t^e instalments which he has paid, and remains liable for the balanse of the price. This may be contrasted with the ordinary law of borrowing on security where, after sale or foreclosure, the valueof the security is deducted from the amount of the debt. 7.     On the other hand, the hire purchase system with all its defects fulfils a real need, and a mere prohibition of the system would rain many respectable businesses and deprive large classes of the population of credit Which t^ey cannot otherwise obtain.
8. The evils of the system are partially remedied inScotland &quot;by the Hire Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act, 1932, which in effect frees the purchaser from his contract if the vendor recovers the goods and receives in all not less than one-third of the hir&quot;- purchase price. 9. Many respectable firms in England voluntarilyinclude a clause in their agreements on the lines of the Scottish Act, &quot;but this goes &quot;but a small way towards remedying the evils.     The present Bill goes very much further than the Scottish Act.10. The contents of the Bill may be summarised asfollows.It requires a cash price to be stated in the agreement as well as a hire purchase price (cl. 2).It introduces something like the Scottish system (cl.  4).It forbids the vendor to enter a house and to seize the goods (cl. 50*It attempts to apply to a hire purchase agreement the warranties which are implied by the Sale of Goods Act in a sale (cl.  7).It limits the right of the vendor to resume possess-ion and enables the purchaser to obtain relief from the court where a certain proportion of the purchase price has been paid.      The court may then allow the purchaser to keep the goods on terms as to payment of the price by instalments^ 11. It is astonishing that any body representing thevendors should have been willing to go so far.      The explanation seems to be that certain reasonable peopleconnected with the trade, impressed with the necessity
1 g oto set their house in order, both in their own and in the public interest, with difficulty persuaded the more respectable firms to come to agreement with the promoters. 12. The Bill no doubt contains some bad drafting andsome undesirable minor features;    and the subject with which it deals is not only very complicated and deserving of most careful consideration, particularly as regards its possible effect on trade and on the habits of the wage-earning classes, but is aleoone which involves much technicality.      I suggest that the Law Officers should have authority to admit the necessity for some legislation on this subject and to express sympathy with the objects of the Bill and the efforts of the promoters to reach agree-ment, while indicating that the Bill may require very careful examination from the technical point of view. One possible course might be to assent to the Second Reading on the condition that the Bill is sent to a Joint Select Committee of both Houses, not with a view cf killing the Bill, but with a view to ensuring that all legitimate interests have received full consideration, and that the provisions of the Bill are technically right.(Intd. )   H.House of Lords,3rd. December, 1937.
