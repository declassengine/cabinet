Copy No. ..( ,&amp;..C a B I N 5 T.SUPPLY OF ARMS TO CHINA Mil) JAPAN.At their meeting on October 6th (56/57), the Cabinet took note of the fact that the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements had asked that the Foreign Office should examine the legal aspects of the supply of armaments from Government surplus stocks to the belligerents in the Sino-Japanese dispute.   The accompanying paper was accordingly prepared and &quot;note was taken of it by the Defence Requirements Committee at their meeting on October 21st, but no recommendation was formulated as to the precise policy to be followed in this matter.     The Admiralty have now been asked by Messrs. Thornycroft and Company to sell to them twelve 18 inch Mark VII torpedoes from surplus Admiralty stocks for re-sale to the Chinese Government.     As will be seen from the accompanying paper, sach a sale would be perfectly legal at any rate in the absence of a state of war.     On the other hand, hostilities amounting in practice to a state of war are now in progress between China and Japan and the Japanese would almost certainly become cognisant of the details of the sale and regard it as an unfriendly act, notwithstanding that they have not yet formally declared war.     The question then not being legal, but one of policy, I would invite my colleagues to give a general ruling as to whether or not sales from Government surplus stocks such as that at present in question would be permitted.A. B.FOREIGN OFFICE.15th November, 1957.CoP. 280 (57).
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ^ITAMNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).a D.P.R./4-3rd Meetings Minute 3.-1-SECRET.n.P.Ro  881&apos; COPY NO._COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SUB-COMMITTEE ON DEFENCE POLICY AND REQUIREMENTS.SIN0-JAPANE3B DISPUTE:_SUPPLY OF GOVERNMENTSURPLUS STOCKS OF ARMS&quot;TO THE&quot;COMBATANTS,Memorandum prepared in the Foreign OfficeoX-lo At the meeting   of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and requirements held on 30th Septembers  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to arrange for the legal aspects of the supply of armaments from Government surplus stocks to the combatants in the Sine-Japanese dispute to be examined in the Foreign Officeo2. Two cases must be distinguished:-(A) That in which  as at present,  there is not held to be any actual state of war in existence.(B) That in which there is a state of war.(A).3. In the absence of a state of wars  there is nothing in international law to prevent the supply of arms to either side from the Government stocks of third Spates.    Nor9  apart from treaty provisions to the contrary is there anything to prevent discrimination in the matter by supplying or permitting supply to one side only and not the other..    Such action might be unfriendly to one side but would not be illegal.4. In the present case, however,  there exists a treatyprovision which might create difficulty as regards any discrimination against Japan.    Article 9 of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty of 1911 contains the words &quot;nor shall any prohibition or restriction be imposed on the exportation of any article from the territories of either of the two High
Contracting Parties to the territories of the other which shall not equally extend to the exportation of the like article to any other foreign country&quot;..   More recent commercial treaties normally contain exceptions to this type of provision in favour of such matters as prohibitions imposed in the interests of public security and health,  and in regard to traffic in dangerous drugs and arms and ammunition.    But the Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1911 contains no such exceptions.5c A similar case arose when9  in the course of theBolivia-Paraguay disputes  the export of arms to both sides was stopped in 1934.    The Bolivian Government contended that such a prohibition was contrary to the Anglo-Bolivian commercial treaty which contained words identical with those in the Anglo-Japanese treaty^    His Majesty&apos;s Government maintained that the treaty was intended to apply only to purely commercial prohibitions and not to an eiibargo of the kind under dis-cussions which was of a collective and international character. Our legal position was however considered not to be strong. The Bolivian Government proceeded to argue that the embargo was not of a collective and international character but imposed individually by Governments of their own volitions  quoting a report by the First Committee of the League which stated that the members of the League who had imposed the embargo had in any case the right to take that action without the application of any Article of the Covenants  and that in taking it they wei-e exercising a normal right of sovereignty.    The Bolivian argu-merits were opposed by His Majesty&apos;s Governments who emphasiszc the League origin of the consultations which led up to the imposition of the embargo,  which, while in no way regarded as a
sanction, was nevertheless imposed in pursuance of the Covenant.      They could not regard the terms of the Anglo-Bolivian treaty as precluding prohibitions of the export of arms in the special circumstances of a case such as that in question.6. The present case is complicated by two factors:    (l)  that there is no League decision to which appeal could be made and there may never be any such decision,  (2) that Japan, not being a Member of the League, the existence of a League decision would not be admitted by her as justifying any breach of her commercial treaty with this.country. A League decision might therefore produce a frank conflict between the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government under the Covenant and their obligations under the commercial treaty.      In such circumstances it is conceived that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound to honour their League obligations and in doing so would be on good moral, if perhaps not necessarily on good legal, ground in contravening the provisions of the commercial treaty.7. Apart from any League decision (or supplementary to any such decision) the arguments which might be used with a view to justifying disregard of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty would be as follows:-(l)    It might be argued that certain exceptionshave always been implicit in treaty provisions of this nature, even though they have only lately come to be stated in terms in modern commercial treaties.      For instance, States
(j cjwould never at any time have been willing to forego imposing prohibitions, even discriminatory prohibitions, for reasons of public security or for sanitary purposes or in respect of certain kinds of traffic, e.g. dangerous drugs;    and would not have held themselves precluded from doing so because of the absence of an express exception in favour of these matters in a commercial treaty. Since arms are grouped with these matters in modern treaties,  the same might be held to apply.    . On the other hand it seems clear that arms are in a somewhat different position from the other matters in question, and could be argued not to be covered unless expressly mentioned.(2)    It might be argued that the treaty was onlyintended to relate to what was done as a matter of trade and commerce, and that in discriminating against Japan in this c.ase and imposing a prohibition on the export of arms to Japan His Majesty&apos;s Government were not taking any action on commercial grounds or indeed action the object of which was commercial in any sense.      The prohibition would be imposed not for commercial reasons but on grounds of high policy (as part, if we could say that, of a process of general collective action). This argument, which is in substance that used in the Bolivia-Paraguay case, might be dangerous unless put forward as a result of collective action, for it might open the door to breaches of commercial treaties.
committed on commercial grounds &quot;but put forward under the guise of political action. (3) It might be argued that in so far as Japan has broken or acted in a manner incompatible with certain treaties, e.g.,  the Nine-Power Treaty of Washington and the Kellogg Pact,  she cannot complain if His Majesty&apos;s Government, for their part, act in a manner incompatible with other treaty obligations between Japan and Great Britain, or if, as a measure of reprisals for the injuries sustained as a result of Japanese action His Majesty&apos;s Government take stops against her which would otherwise be illegal.      This is perhaps the best argument technicallyo8. It may be added that there is no way in which theJapanese Government could take His Majesty&apos;s Government compulsorily to arbitration over a dispute regarding the commercial treaty.9. If a state of war existed,  the difficulties asregards discrimination created by the existence of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty would remain,      There would in addition be other difficulties,-.      Assuming that the ordinary rules of neutrality were being applied,  it would be illegal for His Majesty&apos;s Government as such to sell anas either to China or to Japan.      The duty of a neutral Government,  qua Government, not to supply a belligerent is absolute, and   cannot   be
got round by supplying both impartially.      On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent private manufacturers from supplying belligerents.      Such manufacturers can discriminate voluntarily if they wish to do so   provided this action is entirely their own and not imposed on them by their Government,,10. The question might arise whether the giving of permission by the Government to a private manufacturer to postpone the completion of Government orders?  so as to enable supplies to be made to one of the belligerents would amount in fact to something equivalent to supply by the Government itself.      It is not thought that such action would be contrary to the strict letter of the law of neutrality.      The supply-would remain a supply by the private manufacturer and not by the Government itself from Government property.      The fact that the supply was facilitated by Government action might be contrary to the true spirit of neutrality and would no doubt be argued so to be by the other belligerent if the facts became known.llo If a state of war existed and there were Leagueaction,  according to which His Majesty&apos;s Government might become bound to depart from the ordinary rules of neutrality e.g. , by imposing an embargo on the export of arms to Japan only,  the same position would arise as under paragraph 6 above. Japan not being a member of the League would not admit that action under the Covenant could justify a departure vis-a-vis herself from the rules of neutrality.      His Majesty&apos;s Governmen would none the less be bound to act according to their League obligations-Foreign Office. 5th October,  1937.
