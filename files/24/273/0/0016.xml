Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland.It will he within the recollection of our colleagues that v/e brought before a Cabinet Meeting on the 7th of last July a joint Memorandum covering a draft circular to Local Education Authorities on Air Raid. Precautions in schools (CP. 167(37))   .    It was then decided that the issue of the draft Circular should not proceed until some progress had been made with the discussions with Local Authorities as regards the financing of the main aspects of Air Raid Precautions (Cabinet 29 (37) Conclusion 7(c)). Many enquiries have been received from the representatives of Local Education Authorities and teachers as to the issue of the circular which was drafted with their help,  and we suggest that the most appropriate time for its issue,  subject to one or two drafting alterations which would link it up with the Air Raid. Precautions Act, would be immediately after that Act has received the Royal Assent.    We hope that our colleagues will concur in this suggestion.2nd December, 1937.SoW.E.E.
