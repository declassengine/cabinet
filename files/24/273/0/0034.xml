In respect of such measures the Government have accepted the principle of a contribution.The actual details of any such arrangement must be worked out in close consultation with the undertakings concerned, and it is hoped that these consultations can take place with representatives of the public utility undertakings early in the New Year, the undertakings to be concerned in this arrangement being water, gas electricity, docks and railways.&quot;S.H.
