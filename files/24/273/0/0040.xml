THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET CP. 315 (37).Copy No.CABINET.REFORM OF THE LEAGUE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on certain questions relating to the reform of the League. This memorandum was written before notice of withdrawal from the League was given by Italy, but I do not consider that the conclusions are affected by that event.A. E.December 17, 1937.Memorandum.(A.) History.THE question of the reform of the League was raised at the meeting of the Assembly in July 1936, on which occasion members of the League were asked to submit proposals for consideration at the Assembly of that year. His Majesty&apos;s Government sent in no written proposals, but their views on the subject were expressed in my speech to the Assembly in September. This speech had been the subject of Cabinet consideration. The draft speech which I circulated to the Cabinet (CP. 228 (36)) contained a reference to Article 16 (text annexed to this paper), but this reference was eliminated for fear that it might be interpreted as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in favour of the strengthening of this Article (Cabinet Conclusions 56 (36) of the 2nd September, 1936). My actual speech to the Assembly, which is the only official pronouncement on the reform of the League of Nations made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, therefore contained no reference to Article 16, and there has been no Cabinet decision on this question. In the absence of such a decision it must be presumed that the full execution of the obligations assumed under that Article when the Covenant was signed remains the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, though in practice the execution of the obligations of the Article may be said to have been modified by the Resolutions concerning the Economic Weapon adopted by the Assembly in 1921 (for text see Annex II), which were followed on the only occasion (the Italo-Ethiopian war) when article 16 has been applied2. The 1936 Assembly set up a Committee on the Application of the Principles of the Covenant, generally known as the Committee of Twenty-Eight. This Committee held its first meeting in December 1936. At this meeting the Committee dealt solely with the consideration of the relative importance of the different aspects of League reform. It selected a number of subjects as being of primary importance and appointed rapporteurs for each of them, whose duty 9605   [16332] b1 ,    !
would be to draw up a methodical statement of the present state of the problem in question and to define it, but without making any actual recommendations. Lord Cranborne was appointed rapporteur for the question of the participation of all States in the League of Nations (i.e., in effect, universality) and M. Paul-Boncour was&apos; appointed rapporteur for the question of regional pacts in relation to Article 16.3. At this meeting the alignment of the various members of the Committee was already beginning to become evident. On the one hand, the Soviet repre-sentative, with some support from the French and the Little Entente, is in favour of reinforcing the provisions of Article 16 so as to make the obligation more stringent and more automatic. While paying lip service to the ideal of the universality of the League of Nations, he, in -reality, dislikes it as being a pretext for weakening the coercive clauses of the Covenant. On the other hand, the Chilean representative, with most of the other Latin-American members and the Swiss, Austrian and Portuguese representatives, regards the achievement of universality as the paramount consideration and clearly would not be distressed if, to attain it, the coercive clauses of the Covenant had to be weakened or eliminated. The so-called &quot;neutral&quot; States, in particular the Scandinavians, abide by their statement of July 1936, in which they placed it on record that so long as certain other articles of the Covenant remained a dead letter they would be obliged to bear that fact in mind in connexion with the application of Article 16. The British Commonwealth is divided. New Zealand is in the Soviet camp, Canada and the Irish Free State are supporters of universality as against coercion; the United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa occupy an inter-mediate position (the Irish Free State, Australia and South Africa are not members of the Committee of Twenty-Eight).4. Before the opening of the Imperial Conference, a suggestion was put forward that the United Kingdom in circulating a paper on the reform of the League, might give a lead to the Dominions in favour of promoting, a League, the principal functions of which would be consultation and conciliation, though it should not preclude the employment of joint coercive action in appropriate circumstances. It was, however, eventually decided not to ask for authority to make a proposal to this effect, and the paper finally submitted to the Imperial Conference ends with the words : &quot;the case for leaving Article 16 as it is appears to be very strong.&quot; (See Imperial Conference document E (37) 21, Section II.) However, at the meeting of the Conference at which this question was discussed, the Dominions representatives themselves, with the exception of New Zealand, spontaneously put forward proposals which, if adopted, would have the effect of making the operation of Article 16 more elastic. The published proceedings of the Conference did not give any clear indication on this&apos; question.5. Meanwhile, the reports of the rapporteurs had begun to come in. One of the first to be received was that of M. Paul-Boncour, who stated that because it had been proved that economic sanctions alone, in the form in which  they had so far been applied, were insufficient to stop an aggressor, they must in future be applied automatically in their entirety. But the report which attracted by far the most attention was that presented by Lord Cranborne on the subject of the participation of all States in the League of Nations (i.e., universality), and it has been decided that this report shall be the principal item on the agenda of the Committee of Twenty-Eight when it meets again, probably in January next. Lord Cranborne&apos;s report analyses in detail the various forms of the League that have been or might be proposed, and points out the advantages and disadvantages of each type, without, however, expressing a preference for any one of them. The passages principally relevant to the subject-matter of this paper are annexed.6. The Committee of Twenty-Eight met again shortly before the opening of the Assembly in September of this year. It was at once faced with a revival, in somewhat violent form, of a proposal previously made by the Chilean Government that an immediate approach should be made to non-member States with a view to eliciting their views on League reform; the Chilean representative in fact let it be known unofficially that if action were not taken shortly on this proposal, the Chilean Government would consider leaving the League of Nations. In the end, however, the Chilean delegation accepted a resolution requesting the Council to examine the conditions in which information regarding the vievvs of
non-member States should be obtained, and the Committee thus adjourned once more without having debated the general principles on which the future organisation of the League is to be based. But when the Committee meets again, probably in January, it will have on its agenda the discussion of Lord Cranborne&apos;s report on the participation of all States in the League (i.e., universality), and on this occasion an expression of opinion from the United Kingdom member of the Committee on the subject of the coercive provisions of the Covenant may well be unavoidable.(B) Present Position.7.   There are three- main lines which His Majesty&apos;s Government could follow in regard to these provisions :  (a) They  could  advocate  a  purely  consultative  League,   involving  the elimination of all references to possible coercive measures, and, in particular, the deletion of Article 16. This line has no prospect of securing general agreement, and is in any case not a possible one for a representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take in the existing state of British public opinion, and in view of the present attitude of other countries and in particular of France.(b) They could advocate the retention of the Covenant and its coerciveclauses in approximately their present form, with the necessary corollary that these clauses would remain applicable in full whenever the cases envisaged by them arise. In the absence of a decision to the contrary by His Majesty&apos;s Government, this is the line which the United Kingdom representative on the Committee would have had to take if the question had been debated last September. Any suggestion for adopting a different attitude raises of course the whole issue&apos; of the coercive clauses of the Covenant. This issue may perhaps be summarised by saying that whatever theoretical arguments there may be in favour of these clauses as they stand, they are not carried out in practice at present moment certainly not in their literal interpretation. If they were to-day to be invoked, it is a reasonable inference from recent statements by a number of members of the League that action would not be taken in accordance with them. Further, grave doubt is felt in many quarters whether such action could in the circumstances of the present day achieve its object, at any rate on the economic side. Lastly, an attempt to obtain a decision by the Committee of Twenty-Eight in favour of the maintenance of these clauses in their entirety and their full application to every case of international dispute might result in a number of States, headed by Chile and possibly including the Scandinavian States and Switzerland, deciding to leave the League of Nations; just as the existence of these clauses is, or is alleged to be, one of the principal obstacles to the return of certain aheady absent States to the League.(c) It would be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to advocate an inter-mediate proposal on the general lines described by Lord Cranborne in his report on universality. According to this proposal, membership of the League would involve a general obligation to consult and an additional obligation to take coercive action when, but only when, consultation between members of the League indicated that coercion might profitably be employed. This result might be attainable by interpretative resolution and without an amendment of the Covenant, if that method proved to have advantages. Other types of inter-mediate League can be envisaged, but they all have this in common, that coercion, though possible, ceases to be obligatory save in circum-stances defined or agreed to by each member for himself.8. In his report Lord Cranborne, has been careful to guard against being-supposed to recommend a League of this type, but it is possible that many readers of the report will believe that the last alternative is favoured by His Majesty&apos;s Government. There is, of course, no warrant for this belief: but a pronouncement by the United Kingdom representative in favour of this type of League would probably not come altogether as a surprise. It.corresponds to the reality of the situation;, and represents the maximum of obligation which most States are at[16332] b 2X8
present likely to carry out. While it will not be easy in the Committee to obtain unanimity even in favour of this proposal, it will certainly be easier than to reach agreement on either of the other two courses. A number of States, including the Scandinavian countries, the Netheilands and Switzerland, have already indicated that they do not regard Article 16 as fully operative so long as other provisions of the Covenant are not being applied, and the proposal may be expected to receive their support. On the other hand, it is unlikely to appeal to Russia or, indeed, to France. The possible effect on certain Central European countries of a declaration in favour of weakening the obligations of Article 16 should also not be overlooked, although it might be emphasised that the existing obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government could not be affected by such a declaration, and would be maintained until the application of this Article of the Covenant was modified by general agreement. Finally, it must be recalled that there is no unanimity in favour of shelving the discussions on League reform or of leaving the Covenant exactly as it is. Persistence in this latter view might indeed cause a number of countries to weaken their allegiance to Geneva or even to leave the League altogether.9. It is not suggested that the United Kingdom representative should make any pronouncement before he has to do so; but as has been pointed out above, Lord Cranborne, as rapporteur on the question of universality and as author of the document on which the Committee&apos;s discussions will be based, will certainly be expected to make some pronouncement on the subject when the Committee meets again in January. It may perhaps be possible to bring about a situation in which the United Kingdom representative, as the result of disagreement in the Committee, might be invited to propound a compromise solution. A situation might, indeed, in any case arise, in which he might be compelled to suggest some middle course. It is submitted that should some such proposal become unavoidable, he should be given discretion to advocate the proposals outlined in paragraph (c) above. It should be added that all that is sought for now is authority for the principle of an intermediate League. If adopted by the Committee, the details of such a League would require to be very thoroughly discussed, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be called upon to take up a definite attitude upon them until a later stage.SHOULD any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its Covenants under articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have com-mitted an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the Covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the Covenants of the League.The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the Covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the Covenants of the League... Any Member of the League which has violated any Covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the/Council concurred in by the representatives of all the other Members of the League repre-sented thereon. /ANNEX I.Article 16.
Resolutions concerning the Economic Weapon, adopted by the Assembly on.  October 4, 1921.!   THE Assembly adopts the following resolutions:1. The resolutions and the proposals for amendments to Article 16 which have been adopted by the Assembly shall, so long as the amendments have not been put in force in the form required by the Covenant, constitute rules for guidance which the Assembly recommends, as a provisional measure, to the Council and to the Members of the League in connection with the application of Article 16.2. Subject to the special provisions of Article 17, the economic measures referred to in Article 16 shall be applicable only in the specific case referred to in this article.3. The unilateral action of the defaulting State cannot create a state of war; it merely entitles the other Members of the League to resort to acts of war or to declare themselves in a state of war with the Covenant-breaking State; but it is in accordance with the spirit of the Covenant that the League of Nations should attempt, at least at the outset, to avoid war, and to restore peace by economic pressure.4. It is the duty of each Member of the League to decide for itself whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed. The fulfilment of their duties under Article 16 is required from Members-of the Lea,gue by the express terms of the Covenant, and they cannot neglect theni without breach of their Treaty obligations.5.. All cases of breach of Covenant under Article 16 shall be referred to the Council as a matter of urgency at the request of any Member of the League. Further, if a breach of Covenant be committed, or if there arise a danger of such breach being committed, the Secretary-General shall at once give notice thereof to all the Members of the Council. Upon receipt of such a request by a Member of the League, or of such a notice by the Secretary-General, the Council will meet as soon as possible. The Council shall summon representatives of the parties to the conflict and of all States which are neighbours of the defaulting State, or which normally maintain close economic relations with it, or whose co-operation would be especially valuable for the application of Article 16.6. If the Council is of opinion that a State has been guilty of a breach of Covenant, the Minutes of the meeting at which that opinion is arrived at shall be immediately sent to all Members of the League, accompanied by a statement of reasons and by an invitation to take action accordingly. The fullest publicity shall be given to this decision.7. For the purpose of assisting it to enforce Article 16, the Council may, if it thinks fit, be assisted by a technical Committee. This Committee, which will remain in permanent session as soon as the. action decided on is taken, may include, if desirable, representatives of the States specially affected.8. The Council shall recommend the date on which the enforcement of economic pressure, under Article 16, is to be begun, and shall give notice of that date to all the Members of the League.9. All States must be treated alike as regards the application of the measures of economic pressure, with the following reservations :(a) It may be necessary to recommend the execution of special measures by certain States.(b) If it is thought desirable to postpone, wholly or partially, in the case of certain States, the effective application of the economic sanctions laid down in Article 16, such postponement shall not be permitted except in so far as it is desirable for the success of the common plan of action, or reduces to a minimum the losses and embarrassments which may be entailed in the case of certain Members of1 the League by the application of the sanctions.ANNEX II.
10. It is not possible to decide beforehand, and in detail, the various measures of an economic, commercial and financial nature to be taken in each case where economic pressure is to be applied.When the case arises, the Council shall recommend to the Members of the League a plan for joint action.11. The interruption of diplomatic relations may, in the first place, be limited to the withdrawal of the heads of Missions.12.   Consular relations may possibly be maintained.13. For the purposes of the severance of relations between persons belonging to the Covenant-breaking State and persons belonging to other States Members of the League, the test shall be residence and not nationality.14. In cases of prolonged application of economic pressure, measures of increasing stringency may be taken. The cutting-off of the food supplies of the civil population of the defaulting State shall be regarded as an extremely drastic measure which shall only be applied if the other measures available are clearly inadequate.15. Correspondence and all other methods of communication shall be subjected to special regulations.16.   Humanitarian relations shall be continued.17. Efforts should be made to arrive at arrangements which would ensure the co-operation of States non-Members of the League in the measures to be taken.18. In special circumstances and in support of economic measures to be taken, it may become advisable : (a) to establish an effective blockade of the seaboard of the Covenant-breaking State; (b) to entrust to some Members of the League the execution of the blockade operations.19. The Council shall urge upon all the States Members of the League that their Governments should take the necessary preparatory measures, above all of a legislative character, to enable them to enforce at short notice the necessary measures of economic pressure.ANNEX III.Extract from Lord Cranborne&apos;s Report on the Participation of all States inthe League of Nations.1. SPEAKING in a very broad and general sense, there are three principal ways in which a community of nations organised for the purpose of promoting international co-operation and of achieving international peace and security can be envisaged, though of course each conception admits of a number of variations.(1) In the first place, there is the League which is organised not only for the promotion of international peace but also for its actual enforcement in certain circumstances. Such a League would involve provisions whereby, in certain events, its members would be obliged to impose so-called sanctions, economic, military or both. This type of League may for convenience be called a &quot; coercive &quot; League. As has already been observed, the sanctions to be imposed under it might vary; they need not necessarily be military, they might be purely economic. Again, there might not necessarily be an obligation to impose sanctions in all cases; this obligation might only arise in&apos; certain circumstances of a limited and well-defined character. But whatever the exact nature and extent of the obligations in question, so long as there did exist an obligation to impose sanctions, the League would be coercive in its nature. This type of League is based on the view that it is to a greater or lesser extent possible to anticipate the situations likely to arise in the international sphere, and to lay down beforehand the action to be taken to meet them; that foreknowledge of definite consequences is essential if aggression is to be deterred. It follows from the above that the: present League is of the coercive type.
(2) At the other end of the scale, there may be envisaged a League which would involve no obligation to impose sanctions of any kind or in any circumstances, and in which the only duty resting on its members in the event of an international crisis, so to speak, would be to consult with one another. This type of League may be termed a &apos;&apos; non-coercive &apos;&apos; League. It would of course provide machinery for the pacific settlement of international disputes, and its members would bind themselves to make use of this machinery. But in the event of the procedures of pacific settlement being exhausted without result, or of a member failing to carry out his undertakings as to the employment of these procedures, or of an act of aggression being committed by a member without recourse to them, there would be no actual obligation upon other members to employ any measures of coercion or do more in the first instance than to enter into consultation in regard to the situation.(3) As a matter of pure theory the above two classes might be regarded as exhausting the possible types of League in the sense that any League which involves some sort of obligation to use coercion is a coercive League, and any League which does not involve such an obligation and does not actually oblige its members to do more in the first place than consult, is a non-coercive League. In practice, however, a third type of League may be envisaged which would, to some extent, partake of the nature of &quot;both the above. Broadly speaking, according to this third conception, a non-coercive League is distinguished from a coercive one by the view that the circumstances in which occasion for international action will arise, and the nature of the action to be taken, cannot be determined in advance, and that each case must be dealt with ad hoc. As each situation arises, members of the League must meet and consult as to the course to be adopted. But action, even coercive action is not necessarily excluded. This third type of League, therefore, N while not actually obliging its members to do more than consult, might embody in terms a faculty (but not an obligation) to use coercion in certain circumstances, and might provide machinery for regulating the use of coercion on the part of those of its members who, in a given case, decided to employ it. The members of such a League, while not being obliged to use coercion (save perhaps if all were agreed upon it, other than the disputants), would obtain the right to use it as between themselves and other members in certain specified circumstances. One of the legal effects of giving such a faculty would be that no member which had violated the Covenant could, as a matter of juridical right, complain of the use of force against it by other members, or require of these the observance of the rules of neutrality in the dispute involved. In such a League provision might also be made whereby each member would define for itself the circumstances, if any, in which it would be prepared to bind itself to take coercive measures. The type of League contemplated in this sub-paragraph may for convenience be called an &quot; intermediate &quot; League.2. The problem of universality varies according as it is considered in relation to the different types of League described above. To illustrate this, attention may be drawn to two paradoxes whose existence renders the approach to the subject of universal membership exceptionally difficult.3. The first of these paradoxes may be stated as follows. The ground on which the desirability of universal membership of the League is most generally urged is that the League was intended to be universal, and that it will not function properly, at any rate in its present form, unless it is universal. At the same time it is also suggested that there are reasons for thinking that universal membership will prove impossible of achievement unless the existing provisions of the Covenant are materially altered. It is not for the rapporteur to say whether this view is correct or not; that is a matter for consideration in the Committee. If it were correct, the following position would result, that the steps which would have to be taken to achieve universal membership of the League would in the same breath, so to speak, cause the achievement of it, when realised, to lose a good deal of its value, since the conceptions which so imperatively required universal membership for their full realisation would, in part, have disappeared. In brief, universal membership, in the act of obtaining it, would have been rendered, relatively speaking, unnecessary.4. The other paradox arises from a different aspect of the same thing. If, contrary to the position taken up in the preceding paragraph, the standpoint
of a non-coercive League be adopted, and if universal membership were to be regarded as desirable in order to realise the greatest possible measure of international consultation, two things would seem to follow. In the first place, universal membership, in such conditions, might be fairly easy to achieve^1) On the other hand, its achievement might well be regarded as having relatively little value, on the ground that mere consultation between nations is not a matter that presents great difficulties, whether they are actually members of a common organisation or not. It would be facilitated by such membership, but would not necessarily be dependent on it. It might be argued that, even where absence of membership results in there being no actual obligation to participate in direct consultation, experience has shown that it can often be effected voluntarily and indirectly. In this connexion the separate report on Collaboration with non-Member States may be cited as showing that it has already in the past been realised to a surprising extent. This would not be to say that universal member-ship could ever be other than desirable and useful; it would simply be a question of the degree of importance to be attached to it.5. To sum up, if a generalisation may be attempted misleading like so many generalisations, but perhaps also suggestive there appears to exist on this question of universal membership the double paradox that in a &quot; coercive &apos;&apos; League universality may be essential, but impossible of realisation; and that in a &quot; non-coercive &quot; League it may be easy of realisation, but cease to be essential. Those whose ideal is a more or less coercive League, and who want universal membership in order to make such a League effective, are confronted with the possibility that the principal condition on which alone this ideal can be realised can perhaps only be achieved by sacrificing a large part of the ideal itself. Those, on the other hand, whose ideal is a non-coercive League for the reason, amongst others, that universal membership would thereby be facilitated, must not overlook the possibility that the achievement of it in these conditions might add little to the world which it would not have possessed without a League at all.6. The third or &quot; intermediate &quot; type of League mentioned in paragraph 4 above does not raise the paradoxes which have just been noticed in so extreme a form. Those who support this conception of. the League would argue that, on the one hand, the removal of obligatory coercion, so to speak, would facilitate the achievement of universal membership, and that on the other, the idea of coercion would not be entirely sacrificed, since this type of League would not rule out the possibility of coercion and would, indeed, make provision for it in certain circumstances. Finally, universality, if achieved in such a League could not be said to be valueless, since the League would not merely provide for consultation, but would go beyond that. The rapporteur does not wish to be understood as recommending such a type of League, or as suggesting that its constitution would solve the League&apos;s problems. He merely wishes to draw attention to the fact that the possibility of a League of this kind is advocated in various quarters, and also to the fact that from the point of view of attaining universal membership it may be less subject to certain difficulties which arise in regard to the other two kinds. But the existence of these difficulties, it may be objected, rests on a number of assumptions, not all of them necessarily valid. That is true; and the above reflections are not intended to prejudice consideration of the subject, or to prejudge the issues involved in it, but to be an index to the type of difficulty which will arise.(&apos;) This too&apos;must be a matter tor discussion.
