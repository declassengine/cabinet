(THIS COCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT3C R E T.C A 3 I N E T.Copy HoCP.  265(37)CABINET PROCEDURE . Note by the ?PrimeMinlater.It has come to my knowledge that a very secret O..I.D.  document has been seen bv a Parliamentary Private Secretary.      I am sure that my colleagues will agree that every possible precaution should be taken to safeguard the secrecy of Cabinet and C.I.D.  documents.With this end in view I have instructed the Secretary to the Cabinet to consider the present arrangements regarding the circulation, etc.  of specially secret Papers,  i.e.  those subjected to what is known as &quot;Lock and Key&quot; treatment,  so as to ensure that in future all Papers regarded by him as of a specially secret character should be brought under that procedure. I trust that my colleagues will make such arrangements as will ensure that access to specially secret documents of the &quot;Lock and Key&quot; category received by them will only be given in their discretion to their Ministerial subordinates and. their responsible expert Service advisers and to no other persons.      In order that this arrangement may be placed on permanent record I have instructed the Secretary to the Cabinet to include it in the next edition of the Memorandum on Cabinet procedure.Ni   C.10, downing street, S. W. 125th November,  1937.
