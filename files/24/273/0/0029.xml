it;198SIS DOGIMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTYT S GOVERNMENT.secretary. 0 copy NO.     J J.P.  304(37)C A B I N E T.REORGANISATION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.In July last I was authorised by the Cabinet to inform the representatives of the cotton industry that the Government were unable to adopt the proposals- put forward by the calico printers and piece dyers the objections to which I set out in CP, 179(37),    At the same    time, I was authorised to inform them that, in the Governments view, any proposals for reorganisation should be directed, in the first place,  to an improvement of the export trade and that the Government would sympathetically consider schemes having this object in view and would,  if necessary, he prepared to contemplate introducing legislation for the purpose.The Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations has now submitted to me proposals for the reorganisation of the industry which are reproduced in the Appendix to this memorandum.    These proposals provide for the establishment of a Board composed of representatives of the various sections (including the workers) and of an Advisory Committee of three independent persons of wide business experience.    Schemes put forward by individual sections would be considered by the Board and by the Committee and if approved by the Board would be submitted with a report from the Advisory Committee to the President of
the Board of Trade and if approved &quot;by him would be laid before Parliament in the form of a draft order.    The Cotton Industry Board would have to be satisfied in the first place that any scheme had the support of a substantial majority of the section concerned and that the other sections of the industry had had an opportunity of expressing their views on it to the Board,    It is contemplated that schemes of this kind might cover such matters as surplus capacity, excessive competition, regulation of production, establishment of minimum prices, institution of pools and quotas,  imposition of levies, conditions for entry of new firms and legalisation of agreements with the operative&quot;^.    It would be the duty of the Board and the Committee to satisfy themselves that the public interest generally and the interests of labour and of new entrants were safeguarded and that the scheme was designed to assist the export trade.    The Enabling Bill would cover all sections of the industry and all firms would be registered with the Cotton Industry Board.    In addition to sectional levies for which provision may be made in the sectional schemes, the Board would be empowered to raise general levies for schemes undertaken in the interests of the industry as a whole (e.g. technical or market research and propaganda), and for schemes of this kind approved by the Board of Trade there would be available a Treasury grant on a pound for pound basis up to a specified annual sum.   A period of five years would be allowed for the submission of sectional schemes to Parliament and thereafter these provisions would lapse but the schemes themselves would continue in force, unless revoked at the request of the section, for fifteen years from the date of their commencement, and the other functions of the Board and the Committee would run for fifteen years from the date of enactment.
These proposals hava already received the approval, in principle at any rate,  of the various sections of the industry. The Manahester Chamber of Commerce, however, have made their approval conditional on the introduction of adequate safeguards for the protection of the export trade interests and against the possibility of the abuse of monopolistic powers.While I consider these proposals represent a certain progress in the direction of a reorganisation of the industry as a whole, there are in my opinion a number of points of major importance which will require further consideration before the Government can be expected to pronounce upon them otherwise than in a purely provisional manner.1-.    The definition of the scope of the Bill raises problems of demarcation both as regards overlapping between the various sections of the industry and as regards the position of other industries (notably the woollen and the rayon industries)  that may be directly affected.      It is essential that these difficulties should be solved before the Governments attitude to the scheme can be defined.2,    While there is frequent mention in the proposals of the necessity for encouraging export trade,  the proposals contain no indication (apart from a reference to schemes of market research and propaganda) of how this is to be done.      On the other hand, the matters listed for possible inclusion in the sectional schemes are all of a kind likely to result initially at any rate in an increase of costs of production and prices. As stated above, this point has already been taken by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, which is largely representative of the merchants, and I am clear that it will have to be met by the formulation of more definite proposals before there can be any question of introducing legislation.3.    I regard it as important that before committing ourselves to the introduction of legislation we should have
some indication in advance of the kind of plans that each section has in mind for submission to Parliament under the Bill.     If this is not done, it may be found later on either that abortive schemes are submitted which fail to secure the approval of the authorities concerned, or that schemes otherwise reasonable in themselves are not covered by the terms of the Act and have perforce to be rejected. In either case, the Act would become a dead letter.4.    I see considerable difficulty in the suggested procedure for bringing the sectional s chemes into force by laying them before Parliament in the form of draft orders which, under the present proposals, Parliament will have no power to amend.      This is a point that will obviously require further consideration, but it is to my mind an additional reason for insisting that the necessary plans should be worked out as far as possible in advance of legislation, and that Parliament should not be asked merely to sanction the establishment of machinery without a fairly clear indication of the use to v/hich it is to be put.While I do not minimise the importance or the difficulty of the points which must be cleared up before the Government can define its attitude, I regard the proposals of the industry as a genuine endeavour to meet the criticisms and suggestions that I put before the representatives of the industry last July.      For example, it is provided that the Cotton Industry Board must be satisfied in regard to each scheme that new firms will be subject to the same conditions as firms already in the industry and that the scheme will tend to assist the export trade;
There can he no doubt that the need for concerted action on the part of Lancashire to regain its lost trade, or even to maintain its present trade, is in no way diminished.      I am satisfied, moreover, that if the present advance towards an agreed solution, vague and tentative as it may he, is discouraged, there will he little hope of any further progress being made for some time to come.I should propose therefore, if my colleagues agree, to inform the Joint Committee that the Government have considered their proposals sympathetically.      They are glad to note that certain features of the sectional schemes previously submitted, to which the Government felt obliged to take exception, are excluded.      while it is ii-possible for the Government to approve the&quot; plan or to undertake to promote legislation to enforce it so long as certain major questions of policy remain unsettled, they would wish the Committee to continue with all possible speed their consultation with the sections of the industry with a view to finding a satisfactory solution of those questions and securing the Government&apos;s definite approval of the plan.      I should impress on them that it is essential, before any further progress can be   ma.de that the more important outstanding questions such as those raised &quot;by the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, should be cleared up.      It must also be decided at once what definition is to be adopted for the cotton industry as a whole, and for each section of it, in ord^r that any other industries that may bo affected can h..ve an opportunity of stating their views for the Governments consideration.      There is, in fact, a great deal of work to bo done by the industry before I can ask for a decision on the proposal as a whole, but I should wish in the circumstances for authority to encourage, the Committee to proceed while warning them that at present their proposals are. not   sufficiently advanced to warrant an approach to Parliament.
9 (\  1/ 0I should not, of course, at this stage, encourage them to expect qxcj grant from the Exchequer towards market research and propaganda.It is obvious that any encouragement given to such proposals as these is liable also to lead to a demand that similar privileges be expended in other directions.      In recent years, many industries have expressed a desire for power to control, in one way or  mother, the nature and extent of the competition &quot;between the uni-s of the industry.      The cotton industry can, however, in my view, he regarded as exceptional? and I think we can properly regard any assistance we may give to it in this way as not forming a precedent which we must follow in other cases.      It has lost a large part of its export market, hut it is still a major exporting industry and is a means of affording a livelihood to the bulk of the people in one of the most densely populated parts of the country. Moreover, the difficulty in the past in ohtaining any co-operative action in the industry is notorious.O.F.G.S.ard of Trade.10th December, 1937.
yPROPOSALS FOR IMPROVING THE POSITION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY.Submitted toTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade by theJOINT COMMITTEE OF COTTON TRADE ORGANISATIONS.ManchesterNovember 26th, 1957.
It is proposed that the Government should introduce a Bill during the present Parliamentary Session to facilitate schemes of reorganisation directed towards greater efficiency, reduction of cost, elimination of redundant capacity and wasteful competition, in order to develop export trade.      Its main provisions should he as follows:-1. A Cotton Industry Board to he set up,  consisting of 12 persons engaged in or connected with the cotton industry, drawn from the principal sections of the industry as follows:-    2 spinners, 2 manufacturers, 1 dyer, 1 bleacher, 1 printer, 2 merchants, and 3 operatives&apos;  representatives.      The members of the Board to be appointed by the President of the Board of Trade after consulting the representative organisations in the sections concerned. The main function of the Board would be to watch over and assist the development of the export trade, and for this purpose(a) to encourage or initiate schemes for the generalbenefit of the industry, especially in such matt art; as market reseo.rch and propaganda, and(b) to consider,  on behalf of the industry as a whole,schemes submitted by individual sections, with particular regard to their probable effect on export trade, and on the relations between different sections of the industry. It is suggested that the Board should be as&apos;small as possible, haying regard to the need for adequate representation of the various sections, in order to facilitate discussion and to expedite its work.      Provision is made for schemes to be fully considered by all sections likely to be affected, before being approved by the Board /see section 4 (b) below7.    Members cf the Board would therefore bo free to consider schemes from tno point of view of the industry as a v/hole.
2. A Cotton Industry Advisory Committee to be appointed by the President of the Board of Trade, consisting of three prjosons of wide business experience, but with no financial interest in the cotton industry. The main function of the Advisory Committee would be to consider from a national point of view schemes approved by the Cotton Industry Board, and to report to the President of the Board of Trade, Such a Committee would serve a threefold purpose.    In the first place, it would be an advantage if any proposals made by sections of the cotton industry and approved by the Cotton Industry Board could be examined by men of experience in other industries before being submitted to the Government. Secondly, the Advisors&apos;&quot; Committee would save much of the time which would otherwise be taken up in Departmental examination and discussion of schemes.      Thirdly, the approval of an independent committee would probably carry some weight with Parliament.      It is suggested that there should be close contact between the Board and the Advisory Committee and that joint sessions should be hold, if necessary, to consider any modifications which cither1 body may think desirable in schemes submitted to them.      This would avoid, or at least reduce, the 4risk of a deadlock caused by a difference of opinion between the two bodies.3. Schemes approved by the Cotton Industry Board to besubmitted to the president of the Board of Trade with a report by the Advisory Committee, and if approved by the President, to be laid before Parliament in the form of a draft Order.      The Board of Trade to be empowered to make the Order, in the terms of the draft, unless cither House rejects it within 25 days. This procedure would avoid the need for separate Bills on behalf of each section, with consequent delay, and would also make it easier to amend or revoke schemes if necessary.
4, No scheme to be approved &quot;by the Cotton Industry Board unless -(a) it has boon approved by a substantial majorityof the section directly concerned, and(b) all other sections of the industry have had full opportunity of considering it, and expressing their opinions on it to the Board. There would be no possibility of imposing a scheme on any section which did not desire it, since the initiative would have to come from the section itself.Any section which has prepared, and obtained a sufficient majority for a scheme, would bring it to the notice of other sections through the present channels, and their comments or reservations would be ^available to the Board.5. For the purpose of this Bill, the objects of schemes may include(l) the reduction of surplus .capacity(2) the prevention of waste or loss arising fromexcessive competition. (3) the regulation of the production,  supply, orsale of goods or services (4) the establishment of minimum prices or margins (5) the institution of pools and quotas (6) the imposition of levies on all firms in thesection concerned (7) the determination of the conditions on whichfirms entering the industry shall share in thecost of any scheme already in operation (8) the legalisation^t the request of both parties,of wage or other agreements previously reached between employers&apos;  and operatives&apos;  organisations, provided that (1) any person, firm, or section aggrieved by theoperation of a scheme shall have a right of
appeal to the Cotton Industry Board, and if not satisfied v/ith their decision,  shall have a right of further appeal to the President of the Board of Trade, whose decision shall he finalj    and (2) the Board and the Advisory Committed are satisfied in regard to any scheme that(a) it is not contrary to the interests of those employed in the industry (h)  it is not contrary to the public interest(c) new firms will bo subject to the same conditionsas firms already in the industry(d) provision is made for the expansion of theindustry in response to increasing demand, or technical improvements(e) it will tend to assist the export trade. 6. Decisions of the Cotton Industry Board or of theAdvisory Committee need not be unanimous, 7.  Scope of Bill to he defined, so as to include all firms engaged in the production (spinning, doubling, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, printing, or other finishing processes) and. merchanting of cotton and. allied, textiles. An important point to Be decided before the Bill is introduced is hov/ the limits of each section are to he defined, both as between different sections in the cotton industry,  and as Between the cotton industry and. other textile industries. 8. All fin,is engaged in the cotton industry as defined in the Bill to ho registered v/ith the Cotton Industry Board.A registration system would he required in order to enable the Board to satisfy itself-that all firms entitled to vote on sectional schemes had had. an opportunity of doing so.     Firms entering the industry at any time during the operation of the
Bill would have to bo registered in their respective section?.It would probably be necessary to have a separate register for each section,  showing the firms entitled to vote on schemes prepared by or affecting that section.Although the Bill would be mainly concerned with conditions in the producing sections/ there is no reason why merchants;, if they so desired,  should not be included in the registration system, and consequently be entitled to submit schemes of their own,9,  The Cotton Industry Board to be empowered to charge a small registration fee to cover its administrative expenses.10, The Cotton Industry Board to be empowered to raise levies from ail firms in the industry, subject to the approval of the Board of Trade, to meet the cost of schemes undertaken in the general interest of the industry as a whole,  such as technical or market-research, and propaganda.     A maximum levy to be fixed, and provision made that the incidence shall be equitable as between different sections of the industry.      A Treasury grant,  on a pound, for pound basis, to be available for schemes approved by the Board of Trade, up to a specified annual sum.11. The provisions relating to the  submission of sectional schemes to Parliament to be in force for five years from the date of enactment of the Bill.      Other functions of the Cotton Industry Board and Advisory Committee to continue for fifteen years from datex of enactment.      Schemes approved by Parliament under the Bill to remain in force for not more than fifteen years from the date of their commencement, unless revoked by the president of the Board of Trade at the request of the section concerned..
Any sectional schemes requiring legislation would have to he introduced during the first five years, hut might remain in force for not more than fifteen years from the date on which they were approved by. Parliament.
