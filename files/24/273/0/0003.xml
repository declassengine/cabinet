THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIG BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.SECRET. &apos; COPY NO.______________CP.   278  (57).WELSH    OlIURCH    PROPERTY.Proposed Bill for A d.i us talent of. University College Shares,.Memorandum hy the President of the Board of Education.1.      The Welsh Church Act, 1914,  section 19(l)(b), requires the University of Wales (subject to prior claims which have now been met) to distribute certain property representing non-parochial endowments between the University itself,  the three constituent University Colleges named in the section, and the National Library of Wales.      Three quarters of the total is to be divided equally between the three Colleges, viz:-The University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, The University College of North Wales, and The University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire;and each College in applying its share is to have regard to the needs of poor scholars.2.      A fourth University College - the University College of Swansea - was established by Royal Charter in 1920.      It stands in the same position in relation to the University as the other three Colleges and forms an equally important part in the Welsh educational system.3. In these circumstances the University desire&apos;that the Swansea College should partake on an equal footing with the other three Colleges in the three quarters share allocated
to University Colleges by the Welsh Church Act,The;eoColleges named in the Act, as wellSwansea Collegehave all concurred in the suggestion, but it can only be carried out by Act of Parliament.4.      According to the nearest estimate that can at present be made,  the property to be divided;,  the total net income from each source, and the shares of the Colleges under the existing plan and under the proposed new plan respectively, are as follows.: -PropertyTotal Net   Existing share   Proposed shareincomeeacii 560,000 Tithe      16,800Redemption3 per cent.Stock.Capitular andEpiscopalEstates11,200original - College Tone fourthi  &quot;4,2002,800of each existing; College&apos;Tthree sixteenths).38,0007,0003,1502,1005, 2505,      I should explain that the heavy liabilities incurred for the commutation of vested ecclesiastical interests have only recently been discharged - this was rendered possible by the passing of the Tithe Act,  1936. Consequently no distribution among the institutions to be benefited has yet been made and the proposed re-allocation will be a simple matter.6.      I consider that the proposal is in itself a desirable one to remedy what may be regarded as an unforeseen defect in the Act of 1914.      The interests involved all support the proposal,  the University Grants Committee concur in it and the Treasury have no observations. No other Government Department is concerned.
7.      I therefore commend the proposal to my colleagues as an uncontroversial one and I ask for their authority to have a Bill prepared for submission to the Home Affairs Committee,  with a view to its introduction in the House of LordsoSo17th November,  1937.
