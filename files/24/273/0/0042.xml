This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET.CP. 317 (37). Copy No....^ ?.CABINET.Memorandum on the Situation in the United Provinces.CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a note giving the facts regarding the situation that, has arisen in the United Provinces. Lord Linlithgow and I have good hopes that the difficulties can be overcome, but as it is the first of the differences between Governors and Ministries that has contained possibilities of a serious break in the working of the new constitution, I have thought it well that the Cabinet should be aware of it.It concerns a man, Parmanand, who has a bad record. He was arrested at Lahore in 1915 and was tried with 61 others under the Punjab martial law ou a charge of conspiring to bring about mutinies in the Army, combined with widespread risings in the Punjab. He was sentenced to transportation for life along with 42 others, while 8 of his fellow prisoners were hanged. By 1928, all the prisoners had been released except Pamiauand, who had persistently shown a complete absence of any sign of having reformed. Since then there has been continued agitation for his release, and he was eventually released by the Government of the Punjab at the end of August 1937.About the same time, 6 terrorist prisoners who had been convicted in 1925 after holding up a railway train at Kakori in the United Provinces and sent to the Andamans, were released, their return to their Province being greeted with demonstrations in their favour in several large towns, which were deplored by the Ministry and responsible opinion in Congress generally. On his release in the Punjab, Parmanand returned at once to the United Provinces (his own Province), and in company with the released Kakori prisoners, began touring the country-side and holding demonstrations both in villages and towns, at which their speeches became progressively more violent.On the 9th November, at a Cabinet meeting, the Ministry decided to issue a warning to Parmanand that he would be prosecuted if he did not moderate the tone of his speeches. This was in accordance with the policy of the Ministry, which is not to institute prosecutious for seditious speeches without a personal warning having been previously given. As, however, Parmanand was travelling about the country-side this warning did not reach him, and about the loth November he delivered a particularly violent speech at Dehra Dim in the western part of the United Provinces. A copy of this speech is not yet available, but the Viceroy has informed me that it contained an incitement to violent revolt against the British Government, and was directed towards seducing of the ti*troops from their allegiance to Government. The Governor of the United Provinces was on tour at this time, but on his return to the capital a Cabinet meeting was held on the 20th November, at which he urged that Parmanand should be prosecuted in respect of this speech. The Premier pleaded that, in accordance with his general policy, it was impossible for him to agree to this, as the preliminary warning had not been received, by Parmanand. The Governor, however, insisted that his special responsibilities were involved, and that action must be taken. The Ministry, though not agreeing to take responsibility themselves for the prosecution, did not raise specific objection to the Governors issiring on his own responsibility an order to the District Magistrate, Dehra Dun, to institute a prosecution under section 124(a) of the Indian Penal Code (Sedition).Meanwhile, Parmanand, with some of the ex-Kakori prisoners, had moved into Delhi, which is under the control of the Central Government, and had there continued his activities, but apparently he did not go as far as he had done at Dehra Dun. On the 2nd December they were all arrested under section 3 of the Punjab Criminal Law Amendment Act, the ex-Kakori prisoners for disobeying an
order which, forbade them to take part iu a certain procession, and Parmanand for disobeyiug an order to leave the Province of Delhi within six hours. Parmanand was released on bail, but was then re-arrested while still in Delhi under the United Provinces Warrant in respect of his speech at IJehra Dun. The offence for which he was charged under this warrant is non-bailable and he is at present in jail in Delhi. His case under the Delhi charge is due to be heard on the 22nd December, or, if an application by the accused for the transfer of the case to the High Court is granted, it may be put off till after Christmas. The sentence which he may receive on this charge is unlikely to exceed three months.Meanwhile, the United Provinces -Ministry had been in consultation with members of the Congress &quot; Higher Command,&quot; and came to the conclusion that they could not agree to the prosecution of Parmanand on the sedition charge. The Premier, however, suggested to the Governor on 6th December a compromise whereby if Parmanand was sentenced to a period of imprisonment on the Delhi charge, the case against him on the United Provinces charge would be withdrawn, but the Cabinet would take responsibility for having issued the order for his prosecution, and would give a general warning that seditious speeches of a violent nature woidd not be allowed to go unpunished. The Governor, while not absolutely closing the door on this compromise, informed the Premier that in his view, such an action on the part of the Ministry would appear vacillating and would not really give an effective warning to the public that Government do not propose to tolerate speeches of this kind. He therefore maintained his view that prosecution was necessary.No definite decision was taken at that time, and at subsequent discussions with the Governor, the Premier expressed himself as very anxious at the turn affairs had taken and said that the Congress Working Committee took a serious view of the matter. He indicated that there were three possibilities: (a) that the Premier should accept responsibility for Parmanand&apos;s prosecution ; (6) that he should disclaim responsibility and make it clear that the responsibility was the Governors and that Ministers did not agree ; and (c) that the Ministry should resign.As regards the first alternative, the Premier admitted that he did not anticipate that hi^ followers would go so far as to pass a vote of &quot; No confidence &quot; in him if he agreed to the prosecution; but said that he had recently taken action to suppress speeches in Cawnpore&apos;2&apos; and, while his followers had accepted this, he felt con-siderable doubt whether they would be willing to acquiesce in further repressive action. He was very anxious that he should not be drawn gradually into a policy of prosecution for seditious speeches. He again emphasised his objection in principle to prosecution without previous individual warning, but declared that where such warning had been given, he would prosecute.The second alternative, that the Ministry should remain in office aud admit that they had been overruled by the Governor, was felt by the Premier to be out of the question. Apart from his own feelings in the matter, it is probable that the Congress &quot; Higher Command &quot; feel that it would be very damaging to the position of Congress to have to admit that the Governor had used his special and powers that a Congress Ministry had accepted the position.The Premier therefore made it clear that unless some compromise could be reached on the basis of the withdrawal of the prosecution in the event of a sentence of imprisonment being passed on the Delhi charge, he would have seriously to consider the third alternative of resignation, however reluctant he aud his Ministry might be to take such, a step. In the meantime, he proposed to wait for the arrival of Nehru, the Congress President, in Allahabad on the 14th December, and to discuss the matter further with him. It is possible, of course, though not certain, that if the United Provinces Ministry resigned, the other Congress Ministries, or some of them, would follow suit.In the light of these discussions the Governor again consulted the Governor-General on the loth December and put to him the following considerations : -(1) that when he took the responsibility of ordering the prosecution of Parmanand, the&apos; situation in the United Provinces was definitely alarming.    The removal of Parmanand and the ex-Kakori prisoners* During the labour trouble in Cavvnpore at the oud of November, the Premier fully supported the action of the District Magistrate in prohibiting 14 persons from making speeches or issue statements for a pei-iod of two months. This was the first time that the Congress Ministry in the United Provinces had countenanced any restriction on freedom of speeoh.
20th December, 1937.from the scene with their arrest in Delhi had effected a marked improve-ment in the situation and had removed one of the most dangerous features, namely, the unchecked continuance of voilent speeches. If these men are now sentenced at Delhi to a term of, perhaps, three months&apos; imprisonment, the effect on the situation in the United Provinces will be decidedly good.(2) The Premier had taken the necessary action at Cawnpore, and this also had helped to improve the situation and had produced a much-needed impression that the Ministry were prepared to deal with a serious menace to law and order.(3) It was impossible to foresee the full effects of the Ministry&apos;s resignation, and, though the Ministry could be criticised for resigning on a point that would appear small compared with the issues involved, it would equally be easy to argue that in view of the improvement in the situation the Governor had precipitated a crisis on inadequate grounds. In view of these considerations he asked whether the Governor-General would be prepared to contemplate a compromise if it appeared when he met his Ministry again that they felt so strongly in the matter that they were prepared to resign.In reply, the Governor-General informed the Governor that he had given the fullest consideration to the effect of a breakdown on the general situation and was anxious to avoid such a breakdown if that course was practical consistently with his responsibilities. Although, therefore, he felt grave doubt as to the extent to which it was possible to rely on the Premier in the future, and, although he was reluctant to give way on this occasion when the case for prosecution was so strong with the possibility of being confronted with the same issue in the near future in which the ground might be nothing like so good, he had reached the conclusion that in the interests of the general situation it would be justifiable to take the risks involved in withdrawing the prosecution on the following definite conditions : (1) That the Premier should get from Parmanand an assurance that he would not repeat his offence.(2) That the Cabinet of the United Provinces, in addition to accepting responsibility for having ordered the prosecution, should make a public statement (in the course of which they should refer to the fact that Parmanand was in jail already for another offence) to the effect that Parmanand has given an assurance of this nature, and that in the circumstances and in view of that undertaking, the prosecution has been withdrawn; that it has been made clear to Parmanand that if he offends again prosecution will follow, and that it is only on this clear and definite understanding that the prosecution has now been dropped. In the event of Parmanand declining to give such an assurance, the Governor-General hoped that the Premier, in view of this attitude of mind, would then be prepared to agree to the prosecution proceeding. He added that it was impossible to accept the proposal urged by the Premier that individual warning must necessarily precede prosecution in other cases, and he urged the Governor to consider the possibility of persuading the Premier to issue a general warning to the public.I informed the Governor-General that I considered the compromise suggested by him with the definite conditions laid down is the best way out of the difficulty.Later telegrams received ou 19th December reported that the Governor had discussed the matter again with the Premier, who, though unable to agree to the first condition, is prepared to issue a statement, after the case at Delhi has been decided, making it clear that his Government have been disturbed for some time about the speeches of Parmanand and others, that they had issued a warning which had miscarried, and that in order to put a stop to these speeches they had ordered that a prosecution against Parmanand should be instituted ; in view, however, of the sentence passed at Delhi, which has put a stop to his activities, they do not feel it is necessary in the circumstances to proceed with the case against him, but they cannot tolerate a repetition of such speeches, and if Parmanaud offends again they will have no hesitation in ordering prosecution. The Governor has strongly recommended that this course should be adopted provided that a sentence of at least three mouths is imposed in the Delhi case, and the Governor-General, after consultation with me, has agreed.6794      Wt8177/RUP 8   85   12 37 (Itltd. )      Z
