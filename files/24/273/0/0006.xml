THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1937. SECBET. Copy No.CP. 281 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Secretary of State for the Colonies bases his paper (C.P. 269) on the view that we are precluded by our original acceptance of the principle of partition from considering any alternative solution (paragraph 11). He recommends therefore that, even if the co-operation of Arabs or Jews is not forthcoming, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be &quot;to proceed nevertheless with the partition of the country&quot; (Appendix I, paragraph 5). The functions of the new Commission would be strictly confined to working out a scheme of partition, and it would &apos;&apos; not be within its province to consider evidence or representations not relevant to that proposal &quot; (Appendix I, paragraph 6). I feel bound to point out that, if this policy is adopted, the consequences may be most serious from the international point of view, which most affects my responsibility.2. Mr. Ormsby Gore proposes that Arab opposition to our policy should be dealt with by treating the problem from a purely Palestinian angle, and making it clear that we propose to &quot; deal with the Arabs of Palestine and Transjordan alone&quot; (paragraph 10). The suggestion is that we should try to bring over &quot;moderate Arab opinion in Palestine&quot; by firm military measures against terrorism, while Arab opposition in general is regarded as probably &quot; tending to wane.&quot; It seems to be assumed that Ibn Saud can be relied upon to maintain his &quot; correct &quot; attitude (paragraph 7). I fear that these assumptions regarding the attitude of the Arabs, at least in the neighbouring countries, are likely to prove unfounded and misleading.3. It may be convenient first to consider&apos; how far this proposed policy coincides with the actual recommendations of the Royal Commission, and what are now likely to be its implications and its consequences, if it is in fact adopted.4. The Royal Commission, it will be remembered, put forward its partition recommendations after the conclusion of its main report and outside its main terms of reference. In a document of over 400 pages, only 16 are devoted to this admittedly tentative suggestion for a constructive solution of the problem. The success of the scheme was recognised to be dependent on a number of assumptions, the most important of which was that it would be arrived at by general agreement, which, with the treaties which would be negotiated as a result of it, would make it possible to overcome the obvious difficulties of security, defence, exchange of populations, immigration, &amp;c, inherent in the scheme. But events since the Beport was published have admittedly modified the situation. We have not only had time for close reflection on the wider aspects of the problem and been able to estimate the various international reactions to it, but we are now faced with solid and growing opposition from the majority of the native inhabitants of Palestine, and, what is much more serious, from the whole Arab world.
5. It seems clear that partition can now only be imposed by force, and that many of the measures consequent on it, which, in the Royal Commission^ conception, would have been taken by consent, will now prove impracticable. In these changed circumstances, it is essential to consider to what our policy will ultimately lead.6. What then are likely to be the consequences, and what our prospects of success, if we continue our present policy, and do contrive to set up a Jewish State by force? Is the creation of that State, in present conditions, likely to furnish any real solution ?7. Our main object in setting up this State will be to give to the non-Palestinian Jews of Central Europe better opportunities for immigration, and to the 400,000 Jews of Palestine complete security and independence. Let us take immigration first. Even if the whole area recommended by the Royal Commission be allocated to this State, it now seems clear that the opportunities it will offer for further immigration will be severely restricted. This area is at most 4,600 square kilometres, and already contains some 645,000 inhabitants, or about 140 inhabitants to the square kilometre. As the Jews themselves have pointed out, this density of population corresponds to that of modern industrial Germany, and is nearly twice that of France. It is proposed that the quarter of a million Arabs at present in this area, should be removed. As they are likely to be extremely unwilling to go, as there is very little alternative land of equal value on which they could be settled, and as nothing like a comparable number of Jews exists in the proposed Arab State against whom they could be exchanged, this operation, which Avill have to be carried out by force, is likely to be one of great difficulty. But, even if it succeeds and the absorptive capacity of the Jewish State is thereby increased, it seems in the highest degree unlikely that the area will be able to support at the very most more than another half-million people. Allowing for the natural increase of the existing Jewish population, it is difficult to see how the new Jewish State could possibly absorb any considerable number of new immigrants.8. Mr. Ormsby Gore told the Permanent Mandates Commission that, &quot; if the Arabs and the rest of the country are granted independent freedom, it will be easier to induce the Arabs to allow the Jews to enter their areas.&quot; The Jews themselves make no secret of their intention to expand, and the Polish Ambassador recently said that Dr. Weizmann had given as one of his main reasons for urging the acceptance of partition the fact that it would still be possible for the Jews to spread into the Arab State. But even without these statements, it is surely obvious from the nature of the case that, unless immigration is to be practically stopped and perhaps even if it is the Jews must expand beyond their new borders. Their skill and enterprise will lead them to establish at first economic, and later political, influence in the neighbouring territories. The flow of immigrants from the vast reservoir of European Jewry seeking outlet or escape will drive even those Jews who wish to remain in their little coastal State to seek to establish themselves beyond its frontiers. Indeed, when the Jewish State is created, the pressure of immigration is likely steadily to increase, since (as the French have pointed out to us) anti-Jewish campaigns in Poland, Germany and other countries will be intensified once the Jews can be represented as having &quot; their own country &quot; to go to. The outward urge from the small nucleus of the Jewish State is therefore likely to be well-nigh irresistible.9. What will be the Arab attitude towards this inevitable attempt at expansion? The Arabs are not a mere handful of aborigines, who can be disregarded by the &quot; white coloniser.&quot; They have a latent force and vitality, which is stirring into new activity. If any stimulus were required to their rapidly growing nationalism, it is hard to imagine any more effective method than the creation of a small dynamic State of hated foreign immigrants on the seaboard of the Arab countries with a perpetual urge to extend its influence inland. There are many Arab leaders who fully and clearly realise all the implications of the creation of the Jewish State, and who view with growing consternation the prospect of either becoming a minority in what they regard as a province of Arabia, or of becoming widely subject to steadily growing Jewish influence. From the Arab point of view Palestine is an Arab country, the best area of which is being treacherously handed over to an alien and particularly
dangerous invader by a Power whom the Arabs thought to be their friend. Their reaction is becoming increasingly bitter. I give at Annex I one of the many reports which has reached me on this subject, and which throws a useful sidelight on Arab opinion in Palestine. It may be noted in this connexion that General Dill, who was then Commander-in-chief in Palestine, expressed, last June, the opinion that it was only when we began putting the recommendations of the Royal Commission into practical effect (as we shall be doing when we begin actually establishing the Jewish State and embark on the eviction of its 230,000 native Arab inhabitants), that the full strength of Arab opposition would show itself (see extract at Annex II). But even since Mr. Ormsby Gore expressed to the Permanent Mandates Commission the view quoted in paragraph 8, the situation has so greatly deteriorated that it would surely be hopeless, on the present basis, to look for any reconciliation between the native Arabs and the immigrant Jews, such as to enable any Jews to establish themselves in Arab territory without provoking a conflict.10. Historical parallels are dangerous, but a close and sinister parallel to the present situation may be found in our well-intentioned efforts to i&apos;e-establish the Ionian Greeks on the Western edge of Asia Minor. We did the Greeks no service by sending them back to their classical homelands, but on the contrary consolidated Turkish nationalism in a way which led us into moments of acute national peril.11. With this background of fundamental hostility between the native Arabs and the immigrant Jews, what is our position going to be when the Jewish State has been set up? As I have said, one of our objects in creating the Jewish State would be to give the Jews security. Are we&quot; to arm them to defend them-selves, and leave them to their own resources? It is proposed that the defence of the new State should be provided for by a treaty of alliance. Treaties will in any case be necessary, if only for the protection of our own imperial strategic interests the pipe line, inter-imperial communications, &amp;c. But treaties will both decrease our authority and perpetuate our responsibilities. Moreover, there is no question of our wholly escaping from our Palestine commitment, since under the Royal Commission^ proposals we are to be entrusted and rightly with the protection in perpetuity of the Holy Places of Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth, and possibly elsewhere. Again, with so much inflammable material about, it is admitted that we shall have to retain a right to protect minorities in the new States. Are we to use British troops to prevent all the conflicts which seem to lie so close beneath the surface of an enforced partition ? And, if so, can we see any limit to the extent to which these troops are likely to be involved? The so-called independent sovereignty of the new Jewish state, and the increased bitterness of the Arabs towards the Jews and towards us, must create new elements of danger.12. Mr. Ormsby Gore&apos;s paper states that Arab opposition should not be taken too seriously, and that we can safely ignore Arab opinion outside Palestine if we show determination. I consider, in view of recent developments, that this hope is unhappily ill-founded, and that it would be most unwise to regard Arab opposition in this light. I have already alluded in paragraph 9 to Arab opposi-tion in Palestine. Arab opposition in the neighbouring countries is even more serious. It is a dangerous misconception to imagine that we can deal with the Palestine problem in isolation. The Middle East is an organic whole. The frontiers between the Arab States as shown on the maps are largely artificial post-war creations, resting on no true national, geographical or ethnographical basis. Palestine&apos;s neighbour States are not &quot; foreign &quot; to Palestine in the Euro-pean sense, and opinion or events in one produce quick reactions in another. There is a growing number of Arab nationalist leaders in Syria, Egypt and Iraq, and the example and prestige of Saudi Arabia, the guardian State of the Holy Places of Islam, may yet prove a formidable force.Egypt.13. I will take these neighbouring countries one by one, and begin with the case of Egypt. Hitherto the attitude of the Egyptian Government towards the Palestine question has been, on the whole, remarkably correct, but speeches at Geneva by the Egyptian Representative on the League of Nations and a recent
statement in the Egyptian Parliament by Nahas Pasha clearly indicate that the question is one of interest to the Egyptian public and that the Government is under the necessity of showing that they are not indifferent to Arab opinion. If this sympathy is not at the moment very active, it is, at any rate, latent and ready to take active form if an occasion arises. Such an occasion would be Arab resistance to our forceful imposition of a policy hateful to the Arabs. There is, indeed, a real and ever-present danger that the nationalism and religious sentiment of the Egyptians, always readily inflammable, may be roused to new excitement by sympathy with their Arab co-religionists, of whose civilisation they regard themselves to some extent as the leaders. Such popular excitement would be extremely difficult for any Egyptian Government to resist. Egyptian politicians, and perhaps particularly members of the Wafd, aspire to a position of leadership in the Arab world, both for themselves and for their country. The present Wafd Government is in a state of decline. No successor Government, however, is likely to be in a strong position either. There would be great temptation, therefore, either for the present Government or an eventual successor to secure popularity by espousing the Arab cause.14. These factors and the general delicacy of the internal situation in Egypt provide a promising field for Italian propaganda which would not be slow to fan the flames of pro-Arab resentment. It is not a situation Avhich His Majesty&apos;s Government can contemplate with equanimity, when even in the best circumstances in Palestine we might require to be free to draw on our other available forces in the Middle East, and when we might find ourselves faced with a situation in Egypt which demanded the retention of all our forces in that country. In saying this, I have taken no account of the tension with Italy and the presence of large Italian land and air forces on the western frontier of Egypt, facts which measurably increase the necessity of retaining our forces intact in Egypt and avoiding a situation in which they might have to be used partially for internal security.15. The main importance to us of our position in Egypt derives from the necessity to protect our imperial communications through the Suez Canal, a matter on which, incidentally, the Dominions are particularly sensitive. This necessity w-as the chief reason for the decision to conclude a treaty with Egypt and to accept the terms to which the Egyptians were willing to agree. It seems to me highly important now to avoid substituting for the Egyptian question (which we may hope to have settled for some years) another question in Palestine and the surrounding countries, not less and with its external repercussions possibly even more troublesome. It can hardly be desirable in a large measure to throw away the strategical and political advantages gained from the Egyptian settlement.16. Moreover, Egypt, already nervous for its security on the west, does not relish the idea of a vigorous and expansive non-Moslem State being created as a near neighbour on the east. To create a sovereign Jewish State in the Middle East can hardly fail as I have suggested in paragraph 8 above to encourage anti-Jewish measures in Central Europe. The Germans will not be slow to appreciate that, by making the most of such an opportunity, they will be able both to get rid of more Jews and at the same time to foster our difficulties in the Middle East. With Egypt involved in the controversy, Herr Hitler is brought indirectly into Egyptian affairs. It will be bad enough to produce a situation in which Egypt is thrown (even if reluctantly) on to the side of the Arab countries united in antagonism to us. It will be far worse if, the Arab countries having been forced into the arms of one of our European rivals, Egypt should be brought into the same hostile camp. I attach, as Annex III, a telegram which has just reached me from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt strongly confirming the above views.Iraq.17. Very similar considerations apply in the case of Iraq. The present Iraqi Government have behaved correctly, though the speech of the Iraqi Foreign Minister in the Assembly of the League last September was a strong and able plea on the Arab side, which created a considerable impression; while it was his brother who presided at the recent Arab nationalist congress at Bludan in the Lebanon.   It must be remembered, however, that our position in Iraq is by no
means too secure, and that Governments in that country have of late not been noted for their stability. Arab and Moslem feeling runs high, particularly on the Middle Euphrates and among the desert tribes. Were public opinion and religious fanaticism to be inflamed by some event or incident in Palestine, such as a serious encounter with an Arab band of Iraqi origin, or some serious clash with British forces in the process of the establishment of the Jewish State and the eventual eviction of its Arab inhabitants, the danger cannot be excluded of a wide movement against us. It must be remembered that Iraq is now a very important source of our oil supplies, and that it would be of little avail to have safeguarded the seaward end of the pipe-line at Haifa if the oil-fields themselves were to be seriously threatened. There is also the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq to be considered, and the vital importance of the Iraqi aerodromes to our military and civil air communications with India and the East. A telegram from His-Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Bagdad forms Annex IV.Saudi A arabia.18. Meanwhile there are strong indications that King Ibn Saud may before long be driven to reconsider his whole attitude towards us, and possibly even to throw in his lot with Italy if we cannot give him some satisfaction over Palestine. I annex (Annex V) a paper containing King Ibn Saud&apos;s latest communications to us on this subject, from which His Majesty&apos;s deep anxiety and distress at our own present policy will be apparent. I also attach (Annex VI) a copy of a letter of the 8th November from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office, giving the views of our Minister at Jedda on King Ibn Saud&apos;s probable future attitude. These documents reveal a most disquieting situation. I would only add that the effect of our Palestine policy on King Ibn Saud has already made itself felt in the stiffening of his attitude towards us over the question of his South-Eastern frontiers, and in his revival of his claim to Akaba and Maan and his presentation of a new claim for a territorial corridor to Syria claims which have recently formed the subject of a report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (see paper C.O.S. 627 of the 15th November).The Yemen.19. Hardly less serious is the attitude of the King of the Yemen. It was recently decided by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee that it was a matter of the utmost importance from the imperial point of view that Italy should not be allowed to establish herself in the Yemen. The King of the Yemen was until recently no less anxious than we to prevent this. We know, however, that the reaction in the Yemen to our Palestine policy has been most unfortunate. The Yemeni protests against it have now been followed by the conclusion of a new Italo-Yemeni Treaty, and the establishment of increasingly cordial relations between the Yemen and Italy. Following on this, the King of the Yemen has recently revived the question of the Aden Protectorate frontier, and it is a curious coincidence that the Italians at the same moment should be challenging our actions in the Northern areas of the Protectorate and in the Southern Red Sea.20. I suggest, then, that it is not only useless, but most dangerous to deal with the Palestine question in isolation. All our evidence goes to show that it is now dominating every other question throughout the Middle East, and that our whole future relations with the Middle Eastern States depend almost exclusively on our handling of it. Our European adversaries have not been slow to seize oil this fact. It is difficult to estimate the dangers of a European conflagration, but they are sufficiently real for our potential enemies to neglect no field in which they can cause us embarrassment.League of Nations. 21. There is another aspect of this question which is no less important  that of probable reactions at Geneva. As my colleagues are aware, before partition can become effective, our policy will need the unanimous approval of the Council of the League. If forcible partition were proposed and pressed, I foresee the gravest difficulty in obtaining the necessary unanimity in the Council, and I think it very probable that we should fail in our attempt to secure it. There is, it is true, at the moment no Arab State on the Council, but the Middle Eastern States are represented by Persia and no doubt rely on her support. Further, this is a matter on which we could look for no active support from the Council, not even from the French representative, since France has her own Moslem difficulties.
22. From the point of view of the Assembly, the public demonstrations of our friends and allies against us, which created such a painful impression last September, may be converted into more active opposition. I should view with dismay the possibility of Egypt, Iraq, Persia and possibly Turkey also working against us at Geneva. It could surely prove more serious than the possible -opposition, which would be confined to this issue, of the States with large Jewish populations, such as Poland and Roumania. Such limited opposition would be unlikely to affect the general policy of Poland and Roumania, or their relative positions in the balance of power. But the alienation of the Moslem countries might well be total and permanent.23. These arguments seem to me to constitute a very strong case against any decision to commit ourselves afresh to carrying out a policy of partition in Palestine forcibly and in opposition to the wishes of the inhabitants. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has expressed the view that we are too far committed to the policy of partition to retreat. I am not convinced that this is precisely the point at issue. The declarations of His Majesty&apos;s Government have all been subject to important provisos the approval of the Council of the League and of Parliament in this country, and, above all, our ability to secure at least a measure of consent on the part of the parties concerned. It has now become clear that this consent will not be forthcoming, and to impose a policy of partition on an unwilling population is surely a very different proposition from that which the Royal Commission contemplated, and to which His Majesty&apos;s Government originally gave their support. I therefore feel strongly that the possibility of an alternative solution should not be excluded, and that the new Commission^ terms of reference should be so enlarged as to allow it to consider, and if necessary recommend, alternative proposals.Possible Alternatives.24. Is it in fact possible to devise a practicable and preferable alternative solution? I have tried to show that the Palestine problem cannot be dealt with without regard to the general situation in the Middle East, but this does not mean that a local solution of it is not possible. It is essential in considering this question of alternatives to clear our minds as to the real cause of the trouble, and the more closely this question is considered, the clearer it seems that, serious as the &quot;Palestine problem &quot; in its accepted sense may be, there is, in fact, no serious problem in Palestine itself. In spite of its diversity of races and faiths, there is nothing insoluble in the task of evolving a safe and prosperous future for Palestine and its present inhabitants, including the 400,000 Jews already in the country, provided the Arabs can cease to regard these Jews as they do at present  merely as the vanguard of an invading army. The Palestine problem, as we have known it hitherto, is created by one single and quite extraneous circumstance  the fact that we have hitherto been required annually to bring into Palestine a steady flow of foreign immigrants from outside that territory, who are, in fact, and setting aside for a moment Old Testament associations, as alien to present-day Palestine as the Greeks to Asia Minor and the Moors to Spain.25. A similar problem would surely have arisen in any part of the world if a similar process were applied to it. If a Power conquers a territory already occupied by a population possessing a certain level of civilisation and a growing-sense of nationalism, and then introduces a new population into that territory in such a way as must eventually reduce the original population to a minority in what it regards as its own country, the original population can hardly fail to-rebel at least when it realises that the danger point is reached and that it must either lose a part of its territory or accept a position of inferiority. The whole crux of the Palestine problem is the fear of the Arabs that they will become a minority in a country which they have for thousands of years regarded as their own. I have often been assured that the majority of the Arabs would far rather have continued under the rule of a Turkish minority than be &quot; liberated &quot; in order to fall under the numerical predominance of the Jews.26. It has been suggested to me that there is only one way in which we can now make our peace with the Arabs, both in Palestine and in the surrounding Arab States, and avoid the dangers I have indicated above, that is, by giving the Arabs some assurance that the Jews will neither become a majority in Palestine,.
nor be given any Palestinian territory in full sovereignty, with the danger of its serving as a jumping-off point for further expansion. These are very serious conditions, and the question whether we-can, in fact, reassure the Arabs on these two points is one which will need very careful consideration. But if we could agree to them, we should, I think, go a long way towards recovering the confidence and friendship of the Middle Eastern States, and greatly strengthen our moral and political position,in that vital area.27. Can we do this compatibly with our obligations under the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate towards the non-Palestinian Jews? What is the precise nature of those obligations ? I attach, as an annex to this paper (Annex VII), a&apos;memorandum intended to show that it was never the true intention of the Balfour Declaration, or of the Mandate, to create a predominantly Jewish State in Palestine, although that meaning has subsequently been attached to these documents as a result of later European events. In this Annex replies are also-given to two other arguments frequently advanced by supporters of the Zionist cause, which have led to much misunderstanding in the past, and have served further to confuse the issue. I will not repeat these arguments in the body of this paper, but I think the annexed paper makes a strong case to show that we should be violating no pledge and doing no injury to the Jews, in now seeking a primarily Palestinian solution of the Palestine problem.28. I am naturally not in a position to put forward a detailed alternative-solution to the present proposal for enforced partition. I would only urge that, in view of the very grave difficulties and dangers to which I have drawn attention, all other possibilities should be carefully explored. One which has been suggested to me, and which might enable us to re-establish peace with the Arab and Moslem world, while at the same time enabling us in no lesser &quot;degree to fulfil our obliga-tions to the Jews than would be the case by an enforced partition of the country, is that of the establishment of a fixed numerical proportion between the two races. It would be for the new Commission to consider the arguments for and against this. It is true that such a solution would involve an indefinite continuance of the British Mandate over the whole country. But I doubt whether this would, in fact, involve us in any greater responsibilities or commitments than we should incur by retaining responsibility as at present proposed- in certain isolated and indefensible portions of the country, and incurring new and difficult responsi-bilities, by treaty or otherwise, for the protection of the proposed new States. I am assured that such a solution would be welcomed by King Ibn Saud, who would probably agree, if it were adopted, to abandon his old claims to Akaba and Ma&apos;an, and his new claim to a corridor to Syria. The main outlines of a solution of this type have been submitted to me, and I think deserve very careful consideration. I am not, however, putting them forward to my colleagues at this stage, as I feel that the new Commission should be given complete freedom to put forward whatever proposals it thinks best suited to meet the new situation which has developed since the Royal Commission issued its Report. No doubt solutions are possible, such as some kind of provisional cantonisation which, it will be remembered, was suggested by the Permanent Mandates Commission. But for the moment my main concern is to show the grave dangers which would follow if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to commit themselves forthwith to a policy of enforced partition, likely not only to involve them in continuing military com-commitments of a far-reaching character in Palestine itself, but also to bring on them the permanent hostility of all the Arab and Moslem Powers in the Middle East.Foreign Office, November 19, 1937.A. E.
aANNEX I.Extracts from Intelligence Report for July-August 1937, enclosed in Despatch No. 1065 of September 9, from His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt.Palestine.Reactions to Partition.THE first reaction of the Arabs to the partition scheme recommended by the commission was one of intense disappointment and hostility. Not only did they in general feel bitterly opposed to the principle of partition, but they were genuinely aghast at the manner in which it was proposed to divide up the country, and at the share allotted to them.For the Arabs there are two ways of looking at the Palestine problem. The first is to envisage it as it stands to-day, recognising, that is to say, certain accomplished facts, and to be prepared to accept a solution on this basis. The second is to go on looking at the problem as it arose twenty years ago, to go on denying the very basis on which it arose as having been unjust and invalid; and therefore to refuse to compromise on the basis of the fait accompli.The spontaneous emotional approach of the Arabs is, naturally enough, the second of the two, and the logic of the case they present is very simple, and, to them, conclusive. It is very difficult, perhaps impossible, for them to recognise a fact which they have combated from its very inception, which has been accom-plished against their will, and which finally demands of them the sacrifice of nearly one-half of their country. The emotional resistance to the situation is really formidable and, one can safely say, unanimous. For expropriation of home and native soil is a challenge to the most primitive and elementary instincts, and will therefore rouse not only the politically conscious population of the towns, but even the most backward elements of the rural population, who could not be moved on a more sophisticated and complex issue. Indeed, it seems to me that the partition scheme will, because of this, encounter more general opposition than the alternative arrangement (though by no means a solution) which has existed till now, and whereby the Jews had access to the whole of Palestine and could acquire land anywhere in it by purchase from individual Arabs. The danger to the Arabs of ultimate Jewish domination over the whole country, inherent in this arrangement, was of a more abstract and less tangible nature than the immediate loss of soil manifest in the partition scheme, though this loss is limited to one part of the country and leaves the Arabs sovereign and secure in the other part. Moreover, there is something final an irrevocable surrender -in the partition scheme, from which the Arabs shrink violently. From many conversations I had with Arabs in Palestine and Syria, I gathered that they would definitely prefer the continuance of the mandate over an undivided Palestine, with a restricted immigration of Jews (the temporary solution proposed by the commission), in spite of the independence that partition would give them.So much for the principle of partition, against which all the Arabs feel so strongly I say &quot;feel,&quot; for there is an element which, subordinating emotion to rational consideration, is willing to accept the principle of partition as the only possible solution, although uncompromisingly rejecting the boundaries of the particular scheme recommended by the commission. From all that I saw and heard, I am convinced that the Arabs will resist to the utmost this scheme, which seems to them, not without cause, to give the Jews practically all that is worth having in Palestine; the fertile plains, water supplies and ports of the north. Jaffa, the one port allotted to the Arabs (apart from Gaza, which is of very secondary importance), is to be doubly enclosed within the Jewish area and the -corridor leading to Jerusalem; and Haifa, it is argued, though theoretically retained under the mandate, will almost certainly become Jewish.Union with Transjordan.Nor does the prospect of union with Transjordan under the Emir Abdullah seem to the Palestine Arabs sufficiently attractive to outweigh the disadvantages of the rest of the scheme. The sophisticated Arab leaders (particularly the Mufti) regard the Emir as a backward bedouin unfit to reign over their country; and they fail to see why the Arab world should be required to go on providing.
thrones for the House of Hashem. They were, moreover, greatly alarmed lest the Emir should succumb to this imperial bait and promote intrigues in favour of the partition scheme, a fear which at: one moment seemed only too well-grounded. The Emir clearly was not averse from a partition scheme that promised him the throne of a respectable-sized kingdom, and the Nashashibi party in Jerusalem, in order to spite their enemy the Mufti, showed themselves for a moment disposed to approve partition, and support the Emir&apos;s cause. Fear, however, of the rising tide of national sentiment against the scheme caused them to recant immediately, and they joined the tide.Prospects of A greement.In conclusion, I would say that the partition scheme as it stands will be determinedly resisted by the Arabs, and that any attempt to impose it on them by force of arms would create a very serious situation in the Near East, a situation which in the event of a European war would cause England considerable embarrassment. Iraq (with&quot; ambitions of heading ultimately an Arab federation) has shown itself greatly interested; and even the Egyptian Government, which till now has maintained an attitude of extreme moderation because of Nahas Pasha&apos;s desire for friendly co-operation with England, would be driven to intervene by the pressure of public opinion and the desire to preserve its prestige in the Mahometan world, if physical force had to be employed against the Arabs of Palestine.There is just a possibility, on the other hand, that if the terms of the scheme are considerably modified, the Arabs might in the end accept it, or at least allow it to be carried out, as the least objectionable solution of their problem.ANNEX II.Extract from Letter dated June 14, 1937, from the General Officer Commanding to the High Commissioner for Palestine.&apos;H- SVNo solution to the Palestine problem which the Royal Commission can reasonably recommend is likely to prove acceptable to the Arabs in their present mood. That does not mean that they will immediately rise in rebellion when the Royal Commission&apos;s Report is known. It is, in fact, unlikely that they will do so as long as the decision taken does not involve immediate action.The Arab dislikes quick decisions, but while a question is partially open he is not disinclined to talk, and trust that something will turn up to prevent unpleasant consequences for him materialising. To a quick comprehensive solution to any problem he will react unfavourably, and when the problem concerns the regulation of his whole future he is likely to react violently. He is a leisurely man and believes in arriving at decisions gradually and by a process of bargaining. Should then the policy adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government be announced in peremptory and irrevocable terms, the Arabs are likely again to resort to violent methods of protest.ANNEX III.Telegram No. 645 of November 16, 1937, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE my return I have become increasingly impressed by inherent danger to our position in Egypt and Eastern Mediterranean if our policy in Palestine remains unchanged.   I have touched on this question in my most secret telegram No. 635 on the whole question of defence, but have since seen letter from [16169] c
Ibn Saud* in your despatch No. 1110 of the 1st October, which strikes me as so important that I feel impelled to offer the following comment upon the issue as seen from here.2. Owing to preoccupation with constitutional crisis between the King and the Wafd, Egyptian attention has so far been largely distracted from Palestine. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty has also brought a decline of anti-British feeling. But, as I have already reported, agitation is now being actively promoted on Palestine issue both by Italian and genuinely Moslem agencies. I feel bound to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that pressure of Moslem opinion is likely to become so strong that Egypt, however well intentioned the Prime Minister and Government, will be forced to interest herself more actively in Palestine question.3. The issue of treaty implementation unfortunately threatens to become a matter of party politics, and there is a tendency to&apos; represent treaty as involving Egypt in grave risk and of tying her to British policy. Meantime, the agitation against our policy in Palestine is thus all the more likely to fall on receptive ground.4. I have reported growing suspicion that Great Britain is not in a position to protect Egypt from Italian aggression. Italy is actively promoting this belief. She is at the same time fomenting a powerful agitation in Arab countries that threatens to drive them towards Italy if our policy in Palestine remains repugnant to Arab world. In the event of war with Italy, our [ ? situation] with a hostile Arab bloc, and maybe a lukewarm Egypt, fills me with apprehen-sion. At a time when the Empire is grappling with a tense international situation in, e.g., the Mediterranean and the Far East, is it wise to maintain a policy in which risks of alienating all those Arab and Egyptian friends from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf Avhom century of patient effort has won to our side ? Granted that Balfour declaration must be honoured, can it be reasonably denied that it has essentially fulfilled its original intention, namely, that Palestine should provide a refuge for Jews up to limit of its absorptive -capacity without prejudicing rights of other inhabitants of the country?5. Partition, whatever its theoretical justification, shows no signs of being-accepted. I have always doubted the practicability, for I am advised that Arabs and Moslems generally will never willingly assent to citation of an independent Jewish State blocking their access to the Mediterranean and political and economic integrity of surrounding Moslem countries. With our difficulties in other parts of the world, are resources sufficient to protect the Jews and impose our present policy on Arab world ? Moreover, economically, can a Jewish State live without co-operation of Arabs on its hinterland ?6. If above reasoning is correct, it provides further question whether, in the interest of Jews themselves and of our own safety, some modification of our present policy is not advisable. If asked to suggest an alternative, I would recommend for most serious consideration the proposals of Ibn Saud (see paragraph 6 of translation of his note* to His Majesty&apos;s Government of the 6th September enclosed in your despatch No. 1110). These provide for representative government at present ratio of population, restriction of Jewish immigration to preserve present percentage between Jewish and Arab population, guarantees for protection of holy places and minorities and safeguarding of British interests. Before rejecting the proposals of so tried an Arab friend, surely we should gravely consider whether it is in our power to risk a course which may well end in general Italo-Arab co-operation against us. Time is a great healer, and if opportunity could be given for passions to cool, I should not myself despair that practical experiment might even yet prove to Arabs themselves that Jewish element is a valuable element of strength in their State.7. I trust that in venturing the above comments I have not trespassed outside my sphere or gone counter to the universal rule that a Cabinet decision is final. But I conceive that His Majesty&apos;s Government expects from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives abroad a frank expression of their views in critical times like the present. I have given this matter much anxious thought with a full realisation of the need of implementing this solemnly assumed obligation. But grave Imperial interests are at stake, and I should be wrong if I did not sav [ % frankly] what I feel is the best in that interest.* See Annex V, document 4.
ANNEX IV.Telegram No. 250 of November 18, 1937 from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Bagdad to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(Immediate.)PARTITION by genuine agreement, if effected, would probably be accepted by Arabs here, but up to the present they have only been thinking in terms cf partition by force, and Arab agreement to such a step is to them inconceivable.An imposed partition has always been and still is abhorrent to them, and if His Majesty&apos;s Government attempt to give practical effect to such a policy, I foresee an outburst of hostility in this country which will destroy the confidence and goodwill we have so laboriously built up. The position of the large Jewish minority will also be imperilled.It would be wrong to attribute correct behaviour of Iraqi Government and comparative calm of the public to waning interest in the fate of the Arabs in Palestine or to decrease of hatred of policy of partition.2.   Present restraint is due to (1) The desire, in spite of everything, of the vast majority to stand well with Great Britain.(2) Belief that His Majesty&apos;s Government must eventually realise injusticeof partition and abandon it. (3) The hopes fostered by debates in House of Commons and by the Leagueresolution that practical difficulties will be found insuperable. (4) The expectation encouraged by His Majesty&apos;s Government that full opportunity would be afforded for examination of the situation alikeby Arabs and Jews.3. If responsible leaders now controlling the situation are actually faced with enforced partition, these influences will no longer count, and leaders will almost certainly yield to despair and will not only cease restraint, but will actively encourage extremist elements in opposing His Majesty&apos;s Government.Such a situation as this would leave the field clear for unfriendly foreign activities, the effect of which might well be disastrous.Reasonable elements in Iraq (which preponderate in political circles) appreciate difficult problem and are only too anxious to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in finding an acceptable solution, essential conditions of which must be, in their view, preservation of unity of Palestine and of Arab majority.Minister for Foreign Affairs has made it clear to me that this does not rule out cantonisation, which is the solution he favours.ANNEX V. &quot;King Ibn Saud&apos;s Attitude.Document No. 1.Aide-memoire from Saudi Arabian Minister.THE real reason which made His Majesty King Abdul Aziz call me to Riyadh in this hot season was His Majesty&apos;s wish to acquaint me with the great difficulties which he is having with the ulema (the doctors of law) and the chiefs of the tribes in connexion with the Palestine question, and more particu-larly with regard to the fatwa (religious ruling), for which some of the people of Palestine, Egypt, &amp;c., have asked the ulema. His Majesty would like such matters to be kept as quiet as possible for fear lest their publication should cause [16169] c 2
difficulties for his friend Great Britain, whom he is most anxious to spare as many difficulties as possible. For this reason he took the extra precaution of not communicating this to me by mail or telegram. While at Riyadh, I had the opportunity of meeting some of the leading ulema and seeing some of the letters which reached them from abroad. I noticed that in some of them was a deliberate attempt to arouse religious and racial feelings, while the rest simply contained the usual questions. The ulema, in any case, are most indignant about the Palestine problem, which they look upon as a religious question of the first order. His Majesty foresees the difficulties which might arise in the future if disturb-ances were to break out afresh in Palestine as a result of partition being forcibly carried out against the wishes of the people. In such an event His Majesty might find his subjects, the members of the tribes on the frontiers, participating in the disturbances in support of the Arabs of Palestine against the Jews, in which case, if His Majesty attempted to stop them and punish them as he should do in fulfilling his duty towards a friendly Government, he would undoubtedly be accused of treason to the cause of the Arabs and the cause of Islam, and would consequently lose his position among his people, as well as among the rest of the Arabs and Moslems. If, on the other hand, he were to keep quiet and do nothing in the matter, he would be neglecting his duty towards a friendly neighbouring Government.I was able during my conversation with the ulema to convince them that the real motive of some of the enquirers is to create difficulties for Saudi Arabia -and its ruler, for all they seek by asking for these fatwas, and by trying to inflame religious and racial feeling, is to stir up the disturbances anew in Palestine, so that the enemies of Saudi Arabia may turn round to Great Britain and say &quot; look at your friend Ibn Saud and the troubles he is creating for you.&quot; Eventually the ulema agreed to wait for two or three months, during which the matter might clear up and Great Britain might be persuaded to adopt a solution other than partition.To make the position quite clear I thought it best to send you herewith the ulema&apos;s letter to His Majesty together with his reply.*I am also sending you herewith a note from His Majesty to the British Government putting forward what he considers a possible solution of the Palestine question.HAFIZ WAHBA.13 Rajab, 1356 (September 18, 1937).Document No. 4. King Ibn SaucVs Note to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government.WE need hardly assure our friend, the British Government, of our strong desire to pursue in ail matters of general policy relating to our mutual interests, a common line of policy agreed upon between ourselves. This has been, and still is, the line pursued by us, notwithstanding that the British Government have often taken a negative attitude as a result of its wish not to commit itself to a definite and permanent policy to be followed in the future. Nevertheless, the present circum-stances which are the outcome of the international feeling of anxiety and insecurity, make it necessary for us to approach our friend in all frankness in connexion with one of the most important issues which we have jointly examined in a spirit of moderation, sympathy and friendliness.2. This important issue is the Palestinian question, and the complications which may follow upon it, and which may be of the utmost importance to the future of the Near East generally and the Arab countries more particularly. The British Government have no doubt, become convinced, during the period of serious disturbances in Palestine last year and during the session of the Royal Commission, and thereafter to the present day, of our sincere desire to assist in the settlement of this question in a spirit of equity and moderation. In the same spirit we communicated to Sir Reader Bullard our astonishment at the report of the Royal Commission which we consider as a terrible blow directed against* Documents 2 and 3, not printed.
us personally, to say nothing of its shattering effect on the hopes of the Arabs and the Moslems. We informed him of this before the report was published and before the profound effect it had on the Arabs in Palestine and in the other Arab countries became known.Having seen the reaction of public opinion in Palestine and in the other Arab countries, more especially in our country, which is considered among the most just countries in passing judgment on general political questions, we have no alternative but to draw the attention of our friend, the British Government, to the dangers which will result from any error in handling this question and to the circumstances which surround it or which may affect it, or in other words affect our relations, nay, the relations of the Arabs generally with Great Britain.3. There are very strong reasons which force us to take the keenest interest in the Palestinian question and to use every means in our power to explain to the British Government our views, and to urge them to find a just and permanent solution for it.   These reasons are : (i) Failure to solve the Palestinian question in a satisfactory manner mayproduce a very wide gulf indeed between the Arabs and Great Britain. We do not need to dilate on the dangers which may result therefrom, and which we are doing our best to prevent.(ii) The Palestinian question is at once an Arab as well as a Moslem one.&quot;It is, therefore, impossible for any Arab or Moslem country or any Arab or Moslem ruler to ignore or neglect it without exposing itself or himself to severe criticism, (iii) Lastly, there is the great moral responsibility which we willingly assumed with the consent of our friend, Great Britain, when we issued jointly with the Arab Kings and Princes the two manifestos which had the effective and immediate results of bringing about the cessation of disturbances and the co-operation of the Arabs with the Royal Commission.4. In spite of the above and in spite of the understanding between the Arab Governments to act in conformity with each other with regard to the Palestinian question, we did not wish to increase the many difficulties with which the British Government is faced, by protesting publicly against the partition of Palestine, or declaring our condemnation or disapproval of it, but were content to state our remarks and express our views to our friend, the British Government directly, in a private manner, in the belief that it will favourably accept what we have expressed in all frankness and sincerit)&apos;, and consider it a strong indication of our true desire to follow a common line of policy, which would enable us to face whatever difficulties there may be and find a satisfactory solution for them.But the determination of the British Government, in spite of a violently opposed public opinion, to carry out this scheme, the dangers of which are beginning to become more apparent, compels us to address this note to them, hoping that they will realise that it is dictated by our sincere wish to further our mutual interests and to increase and strengthen the co-operation between the two countries, and in order to unify our common effort towards our common goal, namely, the ensuring of peace and its establishment on a secure and permanent base in this part of the world.5. We can see plainly the signs of the approaching danger in the prepara-tion taking place in Palestine and Trans Jordan themselves, and in the neighbouring Arab countries. We are convinced that the Arabs consider this question as one of life and death. We are afraid that this dispute might become  and it is not impossible that it should a dispute between the Arabs and Great Britain. This is. an eventuality which we should do our utmost to prevent, but the weight of public opinion and the state of the general feeling make it impossible to oppose it in addition to abstaining from aiding it. This is one of the difficulties which we have to face.6. If the British Government take all that we have said into careful con-si deration, we believe that they will do their best to change their decision with regard to partition, because we believe that the British Government had already fulfilled their promise to the Jews while partition robs the Arabs of their essential rights specially if we take into consideration what is called &quot;exchange of population &apos;&apos; from the J wish to the Arab Zone, which is nothing but an unprecedent-dented clearing out of the Arabs from the Jewish Zone.
The Arab Zone has not got such a large number of Jews and the text of the Balfour Declaration far from speaking of the clearing out of the Arabs from their country, insisted that nothing should be done to prejudice their rights. It gives us great pleasure to suggest to Great Britain a fair and just solution acceptable to all those whom the question may concern. It is desired to bring-about a final solution of the question on the following lines :- (i) The establishment of a Constitutional Government in Palestine in whichall the present population will be represented in the present ratio on a basis which will be agreed upon with sufficient guarantees for the protection of the Holy Places, allowing all a free access to them, for ensuring the right of minorities, for maintaining justice and for safeguarding the interests of Great Britain.(ii) The regulation of Jewish immigration to maintain the present percent^age, so that it will never be exceeded under any circumstances whatever.(iii) The introduction of the necessary measures in connexion with thetransfer of land so that the Arabs cannot be deprived of their lands.7. We hope that these remarks of ours will be favourably received by our friend, the British Government, and we trust that they will communicate to us their views on this question before the position becomes much worse.The British Government will always find in us a friend whose concern is to maintain and enhance good understanding and friendship between the Arabs and Great Britain, and who is always willing to do his utmost to create the most favourable opportunities for a permanent understanding and a close friendship1 Rajab 1356 (September 6, 1937).ANNEX VI.Letter of November 8, 1937, from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office. (Secret.)Sir, Foreign Office, November 8, 1937.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to acknowledge receipt of your secret and immediate letter of the 27th October relative to the situation on the Transjordan-Saudi Arabian frontier, and to the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine.2. Mr. Eden has considered the suggestion that His Majesty&quot;s Charge dAffaires at Jedda should be instructed to telegraph his observations on the matters dealt with in the enclosures in your letter, but he doubts whether much would be gained by doing this at the present stage. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda is, at present, in this country on leave, and the various questions dealt with in the enclosures in your letter have been fully discussed with him. Sir Reader Bullard has pointed out that, in present conditions, His Majesty&apos;s Legation at Jedda depend for their information about events in the neighbourhood of the Transjordan frontier almost entirely on the Transjordan authorities themselves. Communications between Jedda and the north-western areas of Saudi Arabia are slow and difficult, while, in the absence of King Ibn Saud and most of his Ministers and officials from the Hejaz, it is difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires to obtain by personal conversation any new indications of the true orientation of Saudi policy.3. On the other hand, Sir Reader Bullard, who visited King Ibn Saud himself in Riyadh on his way home to this country last July, and has since been kept in close touch with the development of Arabian affairs by this department, is probably at this moment in a better position to form an opinion of the probable tendencies of Saudi policy than His Majesty&apos;s Charge dAffaires at Jedda. Indeed, in the somewhat unusual circumstances indicated above, it so happens that the Foreign Office, as a result of the close contact which they lately have been able to maintain both with Sir Reader Bullard and with the Sa,udi Minister in this country, are probably, as an exceptional case, in a better position to form an opinion on these matters at this moment than His Majesty&apos;s representative
on the spot. This is particularly so in view of the fact that the Saudi Arabian Minister has very recently paid a special visit to King Ibn Saud in Riyadh, and is therefore in possession of His Majesty&apos;s latest views. Sir Reader Bullard agrees that the accounts of King Ibn Saud&apos;s attitude furnished by the Saudi Minister in recent interviews in this department are probably in no way exaggerated. In this connexion, I am to request you to draw Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore&apos;s particular attention to the statements made by the Saudi Minister on the 29th September(&apos;) and the 27th October, as recorded in Foreign Office letters of the 1st October and the 8th November respectively.4. In the light of the foregoing, and of the consultations which have taken place with His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda, I am to offer the following observations on the various documents enclosed in your letter.5. Those documents indicate that the Acting High Commissioner for Trans Jordan and the Trans Jordan military authorities are feeling considerable alarm at the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine in general, and at the recent Saudi activities on the Transjordan frontier in particular. The Saudi activities on the frontier appear to consist mainly of (1) the arming of Saudi tribesmen Avith new consignments of arms received through Saudi ports in the Gulf of Akaba, (2) active recruiting for the Saudi forces, including possibly some illegal recruiting among Transjordan tribesmen, (3) the establishment of new Saudi posts, especially at the wells of Tutun, and of the threatening and truculent attitude assumed by certain Saudi soldiers and officials on the frontier. As regards King Ibn Saud&apos;s general attitude on the political question, the Transjordan authorities appear to be disturbed by the indications they have received of (1) active correspondence and intrigues between King Ibn Saud and the date Higher Arab Committee in Palestine, (2) possible Saudi participation in any revolt which may break out in Transjordan against the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government or against the Amir Abdullah, and (3) indications that Ibn Saud may seek to take a leading part in the pan-Arab movement directed against the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, in which Nuri Pasha and other Arab leaders in Syria and Iraq might also join.6. In considering these developments, it must be remembered, in the first place, that King Ibn Saud&apos;s feelings on the subject of the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government have been growing steadily stronger. There is good reason to believe that the King is now in a state bordering on despair about this question. Sir Reader Bullard agrees that it would be a mistake to assume that the statements as to King Ibn Saud&apos;s attitude which have been recently made by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba are exaggerated or overdrawn. It is true that, when the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Palestine and the conclusions of His Majesty&apos;s Government thereon were originally communicated to the King at the beginning of July, His Majesty did not at once react as violently as he has done since, and that it looked at first as though his main preoccupation was with his own immediate interests, in so far as they might be threatened by the emancipation of the Amir Abdullah from British control, and the constitution of Transjordan and &quot; Arab Palestine &quot; into a single independent and possibly hostile State. There are indications, however, that King Ibn Saud has now realised that the formation of a compact homogeneous and independent Jewish sovereign State on the Mediterranean coast of what he regards as an essentially Arab country, with a strong tendency towards expansion, either economically or politically, into the neighbouring countries, as a result of the pressure of immigration from the many thousands of Central European Jews who will inevitably seek a refuge therein, must involve a serious threat to the hopes which he is known to cherish of the evolution of an independent Arab confederation. There are indications that King Ibn Saud&apos;s dominant motive is now a resolve to do whatever may lie in his power to prevent the establishment of any wholly, or even predominantly, Jewish State in Palestine, and it is probable that, as the creation of this State, in accordance with the present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, approaches its fulfilment, his opposition to that policy will become increasingly strong and active.7. Secondly, King Ibn Saud has always made it plain that he is only prepared to accept the present regime, and the present southern frontier of Transjordan, on* See Annex V.
the basis of His Majesty&apos;s Government remaining the ultimate authority in that country and continuing to exercise their present control over the Amir Abdullah. His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed King Ibn Saud that it Is their intention to put into execution in Palestine a scheme of partition, one of the effects of which would almost certainly be to make the Amir Abdullah  although he has not been mentioned by name an independent sovereign with a considerable accession of territory to the west of the Jordan. King Ibn Saud has, in reply, made it clear that he would regard this as a personal threat, and that he would consider himself, if this situation were to come about, as having regained his freedom of action against the Amir. King Ibn Saud has been given no reason to believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to reconsider, or defer the execution of, their policy, and, if the reports of military activity on the Saudi side of the frontier are correct, it is perhaps not unnatural that he should therefore already be taking preliminary measures to prepare for a possible struggle against the Amir. This does not, in Mr. Eden&apos;s view, necessarily imply any aggressive intention on King Ibn Saud&apos;s part, at any rate at this stage. His Majesty&apos;s past experiences of the Amir&apos;s attitude towards him, more especially at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion, were not such as to predispose him to look on the Amir&apos;s intentions towards him with any confidence. It will be remembered that, when the Transjordan-Saudi settlement was concluded in 1933, King Ibn Saud made it clear that he relied on the influence and control of His Majesty&apos;s Government over the Amir to ensure that the settlement was loyally observed. It would perhaps not be too much to say that it is only the presence of Major Glubb and the British frontier force that has been responsible for the maintenance of peace during the past few years on the somewhat artificial and ill-defined de facto boundary which separates Transjordan from Saudi Arabia.8. Apart from his personal relations with the Amir Abdullah and his declared intention of reviving his claims to Akaba and Ma&apos;an on the withdrawal of British control from Transjordan, King Ibn Saud may not unnaturally be actuated by other motives in strengthening his military position on his north-western frontier. It may well be that he regards it as probable that there will be large-scale rebellion against British authority in Palestine when His Majesty&apos;s Government eventually begin to undertake the military measures which will presumably be required to enable them to impose their policy. This, unless the boundaries of the proposed Jewish State are considerably modified as a result of the impending examination by a second commission, means abandoning to the Jewish State most of the best land in Palestine, and either leaving an enormous Moslem minority in the Jewish State or transferring by force large numbers of Moslems to areas which, so far as can be seen, could not support anything but small and scattered groups of inhabitants. It may be that Ibn Saud contemplates that, if such a rebellion were to break out, it might be directed also against the Amir Abdullah, who has become somewhat suspect and unpopular in the Arab world, partly owing to his acquiescence in the partition policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and partly owing to his supposed pro-Turkish sympathies as evinced in the course of his recent visit to Turkey. King Ibn Saud, no doubt, assuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend at an early date to relinquish their control over Transjordan, may feel it necessary to take precautionary measures on his frontier, in view of the possibility of a critical situation developing on his northern flank.9. As regards the minor instances of frontier activity, and of an increasingly truculent or threatening attitude on the part of Saudi forces on the Transjordan frontier, the question of Saudi rights over the wells at Tutuii has, as Mr. Ormsby Gore is aware, already formed the subject of exhaustive inter-departmental discussion, in the course of which it has been clearly established that the wells of Tutun are on the Saudi side of the line laid down and defined by His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves as constituting the southern boundary of Transjordan. Until further steps are taken to establish a clear definition of at least what His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves regard as the boundary in this area, it seems probable that it will be difficult to avoid minor incidents of this kind. But if, as suggested above, King Ibn Saud is now contemplating however reluctantly the possibility of hostilities of one kind or another eventually breaking out in Transjordan, it would be only natural that he should be allowing his people rather more freedom of speech over the Akaba and Ma&apos;an question
than in the past, when he had agreed to refrain from pressing this claim as a mark of personal friendship and consideration for His Majesty&apos;s Government.10. If the foregoing estimate of King Ibn Saud&apos;s attitude is correct, Mr. Eden cannot but regard the future position with grave misgiving. It has been suggested that, in spite of his strong feelings on the Palestine question, King Ibn Saud will not become openly and actively hostile to His Majesty&apos;s Government unless some major development should occur, such as a European war. But it must be remembered that the leaders of the Arab opposition to the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government are likely to make every effort to induce King Ibn Saud to intervene actively on their behalf. As will have been noticed from the enclosures in Foreign Office letter of the 1st October, the Ulema and religious leaders of Nejd are already strongly urging him to declare a holy war, or at least to allow his northern tribes freedom to cross the frontier in support of the Arab cause. King Ibn Saud is well aware of all the advantages of friendship with His Majesty&apos;s Government, but if he were offered participation in a scheme, which, if successful, would put an end to the proposed partition of Palestine, and would lead to the eventual replacement of the Amir Abdullah and possibly of King Ghazi by a Saudi prince, the temptation to accept such an offer would be very great. His Majesty&apos;s Government are unfortunately hardly in a position to offer him any very substantial advantages on the other side. On the contrary, King Ibn Saud is at present excluded from many objects which he is known or suspected to covet solely because the local Arab rulers have the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government, e.g., possible oil-bearing lands in Qatar and the Port of Koweit, and the enemies of His Majesty&apos;s Government are not likely to neglect to dangle these baits before his eyes. In fact, the position of His Majesty may be compared with that of Turkey in 1914, when the Allies eould only offer her the maintenance of the status quo, whereas the Central Powers could inflame her enthusiasm with the prospect of recovering Egypt and territories in the Caucasus. It is true that Turkey eventually found she had backed the wrong horse, but her accession to the Central Powers was a disaster to the Allies and might well have turned the scale against them.11. But, while it may be that King Ibn Saud will do no more than allow &quot; volunteers &quot; to cross into Trans Jordan from Palestine to assist in any Arab rising, the possibilitjr of even more serious developments cannot, in Mr. Eden&apos;s view, be excluded. Notwithstanding the professions of friendship which are the normal form of intercourse in Arabian countries, and notwithstanding the sincerity and straightforwardness which King Ibn Saud has hitherto always shown in his dealings with His Majesty&apos;s Government, he may now be beginning to question the value of British friendship, if it means, in his view, his acquiescence in the establishment in Palestine of a strong Jewish State likely in time to spread its influence and control over the neighbouring Arab countries. King Ibn Saud has hitherto made no secret of disliking the Italians and their methods, but Italian agents, largely as the result of the effect in Arab countries of the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, have lately been most successful in strengthening Italian influence and prestige in certain parts of Arabia, notably in the Yemen. It would perhaps be rash to exclude completely the possibility of a similar development taking place in Saudi Arabia, and it may be that King Ibn Saud will come to feel that, if he were to accept the induce-ments which the Italians have so often offered him to sever his British connexion, he might be able to make use of Italian help to further the Arab cause, and still be able eventually to free himself from Italian control. He may feel, indeed, that it would be better to accept the very real assistance which the Italians can offer him, e.g., in air matters and in the supply of arms, than to continue, for the sake of a friendship which has brought him comparatively little direct material advantage, to keep his hands tied in, what is now to the Arabs, the dominating-question of the day.12. Whatever the future may hold in store, the fact is at least clear that King Ibn Saud&apos;s long-standing friendship for this country is being put to an extremely severe test. It would be idle to speculate further on the possibility of his definitely deciding to break that friendship and to turn to other countries for the help and support he needs; but the possibility of his doing so cannot be excluded, and, in Mr. Eden&apos;s view, should be taken into serious account when the question of the precise line of policy to be pursued in Palestine is next considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.[16169] x)

RENDEL.ANNEX VII.Balfour Declaration.Extract from a Foreign Office Memorandum of October 25, 1937, regarding the Original Intention and Implicatidns of the Balfour Declaration.THE text of the Balfour Declaration of the 2nd November, 1917, runs as follows : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government view with favour the establishment in - Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;2. It is clear that the extent of our obligation to the non-Palestinian Jews depends primarily on the correct interpretation of this somewhat ambiguous document. By the Zionists of to-day, and, indeed, by the majority of the British public, it is now generally regarded as an undertaking on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to create in Palestine a predominantly Jewish State. It is obvious that this interpretation involves the eventual displacement of the present population of Palestine by a new population of Jewish immigrants, the Jewish immigrants into Palestine standing in the same relation towards the native inhabitants as the early European colonists of America towards the indigenous Red Indians, or the colonists of Australia towards the Australian aborigines. It has been represented that there would still be room for the Arabs in this Jewish State, but it would be easy to show that the Zionists themselves do not seriously expect the Arabs to remain in Palestine under a Jewish State except on sufferance as hewers of wood and drawers of water.3. Was this the real intention of the Balfour Declaration? Let us for a moment look at the declared war aims of the Allies, with particular reference to the Middle East, as repeatedly stated both before and after the issue of the Balfour Declaration. It has been said that the promise to the Arabs was contained in the McMahon letter. That letter has formed the subject of much controversy and explanation, but it is not really the most material factor in the situation. The real pledge to the Arabs and to the rest of the indigenous population in Palestine, apart from the provisos in the Balfour Declaration itself, is rather our whole attitude and policy during the War and Armistice periods, when we so frequently declared that our objects were the liberation of territories subject to alien domination, the right to self-determination of the inhabitants of those territories, and a fixed intention not to interfere with what were more than once described as the home lands of the various people of Asia. It is in the light of these reiterated statements of our policy and war aims, that the obscurities of the Balfour Declaration must be read. A few examples of these statements will suffice.4. In the British Governments reply of June 1917, to the Russian note regarding Allied war aims, it was stated that, to the other objects with which the British Government entered the War had now been added &apos;&apos; that of liberating populations oppressed by alien tyranny.&quot;&apos; Mr. Balfour himself, only four days after the issue of the famous declaration bearing his name, stated in the House of Commons on the 6th November, 1917, that one of the objects of the War was &quot; the duty of taking away from under Turkish rule people who are not Turks, who have been tyrannised over by the Turks . . . . and who .... would flourish under their own rule .... if they were given the chance.&quot; M. Pichon, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 27th December, 1917, stated that the &quot; policy
of the rights of nationalities &apos;&apos; was an integral part of the war aims of the Allied Powers, and that it should apply &quot; to all peoples who, against their will, suffered the yoke of any oppressor whatsoever,&quot; and who should all be given &quot; the chance of themselves determining their fate.&quot; A few days later, Mr. Lloyd George, in his speech to the delegates of the Trades Unions in the Central Hall, Westminster, on the 5th January, 1918, said : &quot; While we do not challenge the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the home lands of the Turkish race . . . . Arabia, Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine are, in our judgment, entitled to a recognition of their separate national conditions.&quot; The Royal Commission has itself pointed out how President Wilson, in the twelfth of his Fourteen Points of the 8th January, 1918, laid down that &quot;the Turkish parts of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities, which are now under Turkish rule, should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely xmmolested opportunity of autonomous development.&quot; This was followed by the Anglo-French Joint Declaration of the 7th November, 1918, stating that &quot; the object aimed at by France and Great Britain in continuing the War in the East&quot; was &quot;the complete and definite emancipation of the people so long oppressed by the Turks, and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.&quot;5. It is difficult to see how it would have been compatible with these declarations, and with the attitude of the Allied governments and peoples towards the War, to have contemplated a policy which obviously could end in one result only, that is, the transformation of an Arab country which, though small, was nevertheless one of the few fertile territories in Arabia (and contained, moreover, the third Holy City of Islam) from a predominantly Arab to a predominantly Jewish State, the native Arab population being replaced by, or wholly subjected to, a new population of alien immigrants, towards whom they were known to entertain feelings of growing dislike. Indeed, the proviso in the Balfour Declaration that &quot; nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine &quot; would surely have been quite meaningless, had this been the intention.6. But in interpreting the meaning of the Balfour Declaration the most important document of all is perhaps Article 22 of the Covenant of the League, which is the basis of the Palestine Mandate itself. The relevant passage in this article is paragraph 4, which runs as follows : &quot; Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish Empire have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory.&quot; The fact cannot be escaped that, since this paragraph of the Covenant is the fundamental sanction of the Mandate, the Mandate cannot be in direct conflict with its provisions. Indeed, the Mandate refers in terms to Article 22 of the Covenant as its basis, as well as to the Balfour Declaration, and Article 2 of the Mandate, besides speaking of the establishment of the Jewish &quot; national home,&quot; lays down categorically^ as an obligation not incompatible with the establishment of that home, and of equal importance therewith, the &quot; development of self-governing institutions,&quot; and &quot;the safeguarding of the civil and religious rights of all the inhabitants of Palestine, irrespective of race and religion.&quot; The rights of the indigenous population of Palestine are further safeguarded by the provision in Article 6 of the Mandate, that the Mandatory is to ensure &apos;&apos; that the rights and position of other sections of the population (i.e., the population other than immigrant Jews) are not prejudiced.&quot;7. These texts, which are, of course, very familiar ground, are only quoted in order to show that the Balfour Declaration was not originally intended to provide for the conversion of Palestine from an Arab into a Jewish State, or to establish a policy which as is now recognized can only end in the suppression or eviction of its native population. If the Balfour Declaration is to be regarded as compatible with the various pronouncements and texts quoted above, it can only be on the assumption that the Jewish &quot; national home,&quot; of which it speaks, was to be a focus and centre for Jewish culture and civilisation, a place to which the Jews could look for inspiration and guidance, and where they could maintain the headquarters of their international institutions, but not that that &quot; home &quot; was to substitute them for the native population as the rulers of the territory
concerned. The provision subsequently adopted in Article 6 of the Mandate, by which the Mandatory should &quot; facilitate Jewish immigration into Palestine,&quot; was specifically limited by the proviso in the same article that the position of the existing population was not thereby to be prejudiced, a proviso which again would be meaningless if Jewish immigration were to be allowed to extend to the creation of a Jewish majority. But, when the Mandate was drawn up, the Jewish population of Palestine was so small that there was still ample room for a large immigration of Jews, without any serious interference with the rights and position of the native population of the country.8. It may be convenient here to answer two arguments frequently advanced by supporters of the policy of the creation of a Jewish State. One is that, since Great Britain was mainly responsible for liberating the Arabs from alien rule, she has a moral right to dispose of at least a part of Arab territory in whatever way she thinks fit, and that the Arabs who had been under the alien domination of the Turks for so long a period had no right to protest against any action which His Majesty&apos;s Government might have thought fit, as part of the process of the general &quot; liberation,&quot; to take in respect of certain Arab territories. The answer to this surely is that the question whether the native populations of Palestine, Syria, Iraq, &amp;c, have a moral and political right to freedom and to what used to be called &quot; self-determination,&quot; and the question whether we are justified in displacing the native population of Palestine in order to bring in a new popula-tion from Central Europe which has had no direct connexion with the country for over 2,000 years, can hardly be affected by the fact that Arab countries had been under alien domination for some centuries before the war. Otherwise this argument would apply equally to Czechoslovakia and to Poland; yet no one would seriously argue that, because those countries were liberated as a result of the great war, England and France thereby acquired a right to dispose of portions of Poland and Bohemia to an alien race against the wishes of the inhabitants. The analogy with Palestine is closer than it seems. Incidentally there is little doubt that if the Palestine Arabs had had to choose between remaining under Turkish rule, and seeing their country become a Jewish State in which they would be gradually reduced to a powerless minority, they would unhesitatingly have chosen the first alternative. They would no less emphatically repudiate the suggestion that the second could be regarded as &quot; liberation.&apos;9. Another argument, which it may be well to answer at this point, is that the area in Palestine which it is proposed to make available for immigration by Central European Jews is, like the baby in Midshipman Easy, &quot; a very little one.&quot; It is said that the Arab countries are of vast extent and that Palestine represents only a small corner of them. This can hardly afford any consolation to the quarter of a million Arabs who will have to leave the proposed Jewish State, or to the million or so remaining Arabs in the neighbouring territories, who will be cut off from the sea and are likely to become an easy prey to the inevitable expansion of the Jews. But apart from this, it is really impossible to consider the Arab countries merely on a basis of geographical extent. By far the greater part of the area covered on the map by the Arab countries consists of almost uninhabitable desert. If only those parts of the Arab countries which can be cultivated and developed and can support a stable population are taken into account, it will be found that the area which we propose to constitute into a new Jewish State for the benefit of the non-Palestinian Jews is a very much larger proportion of the total habitable area than it seems.
