THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.Copy No.CABINET.QUESTIONS ARISING FROM THE REFUGEE PROBLEM IN SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT will be recalled that Cabinet authority was obtained on the 2nd September for the chartering of a merchant vessel for an indefinite period for the evacuation from Valencia to Marseilles of the Spanish refugees in the various foreign missions in Madrid, who were then reported by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Valencia to be in great danger. The steamship Gibel Zerjon was accordingly chartered, and it is estimated that by the 19th December, the date on which the present charter ends, she will have evacuated approximately 2,500 of the 4,000 refugees in question, apart from men of military age who are unable to leave, of whom there are a further 2,500. Judging from the reports received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Hendaye, who has received an expression of gratitude from the Insurgent Red Cross Society, this undertaking has fully justified the expenditure incurred and has gone a long way towards removing the mistaken impression prevalent in insurgent territory, ever since the evacuations from Bilbao, that the humanitarian activities of His Majesty&apos;s Government were confined to the relief of supporters of the Spanish Government. By the 19th December the Gibel Zerjon will have cost His Majesty&apos;s Government approximately  27,000, but it is hoped to obtain reimbursement of a considerable part of this sum, as undertakings have been received from eight foreign Governments to repay the costs incurred in evacuating the refugees from their respective missions.It will be noted that there are a considerable number of refugees in the foreign missions who have not been able to take advantage of the evacuation facilities provided by the Gibel Zerjon. There are also large numbers of the civil population of Madrid awaiting evacuation, and the acting consul at Madrid has drawn up a list of several thousand specially deserving cases, and has organised a transport service for these refugees from Madrid to Valencia. Some 2,000 of these were evacuated in His Majesty&apos;s hospital ship Maine, when she was available, but there are still many thousands in need of transport facilities, and enquiries continue to be received daily by the Foreign Office from British subjects and firms anxious to rescue their Spanish relations and representatives. It will therefore be seen that there is a strong case on humanitarian grounds for continuing the service of the Gibel Zerjon.This evacuation work, however, has in practice assisted almost entirely supporters of General Franco, and it is felt that, both on humanitarian grounds and for reasons of internal and foreign policy, it is now time that His Majesty&apos;s Government should turn their attention to some form of relief work which would benefit non-combatants on the Government side, so that His Majesty&apos;s Government can maintain, if necessary, that the results of their contributions to relief work have reached both sides in approximately equal proportions.Reliable reports have recently been received from representatives of the iSociety of Friends and others of the terrible conditions existing as a result of a shortage of food in the relief camps in Catalonia, where the greater part of the 9600   [16302]SECRET. CP. 302 (37).
refugee children on the Government side are now collected; and the Friends Service Council have proposed that an international relief organisation, with its headquarters in Paris, should be formed for the purpose of providing, with ,the least possible delay, one hot meal a day for 250,000 Spanish refugee children. The greater part of the children known to be in urgent need of food are, in fact, in Catalonia, but the organisation would, nevertheless, cover the whole of Spain, and would provide food impartially where it was most genuinely needed. The organisation would appoint a high commissioner and also agents, each of whom would be responsible for a certain area of Spain. In distributing the food, the assistance and co-operation would be sought of the official Government relief organisations of both sides, and of the various voluntary relief organisations already working in Spain.The estimated cost of feeding these --children for four months, including transport and overhead charges, is  147,000, and it is considered that a contribu-tion from His Majesty&apos;s Government of  25,000 would be required in order to set the organisation on its feet. It is proposed that&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government should nominate a representative on the committee of the organisation, who would be directly responsible to the Foreign Office for the expenditure of the contribu-tion received from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and who would voice the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the policy to be adopted by the organisation. This scheme appears to be the most practicable one yet proposed for providing the form of relief required in a suitable manner and with a minimum of delay, and it is hoped that the initiative taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government would result in a genuine international effort to deal with the Spanish refugee problem.Mention should here be made of the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government have already contributed  5,000 to the Spanish Relief Section of the Inter-national Red Cross, who are understood to divide their expenditure approximately evenly as between the two sides. But although there is every reason to think that this sum will be wisely spent, the International Red Cross are concerned primarily with the provision of medical supplies and with negotiating exchanges of hostages, and they hardly touch the question of feeding of the civil population, nor do they claim to be in a position to do so.To sum up, it is proposed that (1) the steamship Gibel Zerjon should now be withdrawn from evacuation service; (2) with a view to equalising the humanitarian-tarian services afforded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as between the two sides in the Spanish conflict, the Foreign Office should now be authorised to contribute  25,000 towards an organisation formed under the auspices of the Society of Friends for the purpose of feeding Spanish children who have been driven from their homes as a result of the civil war.A. E.December 10, 1937.
