THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECEET.Copy No.   47CP. 308 (37).CABINET.PROTECTION OF VITAL SERVICES.Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I CIRCULATE herewith an interim report from the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence which is considering the protection and main-tenance in war of public or essential services vital to the effective prosecution of war and the life of the community.This report deals with the Gas and Electricity Industries. Further consideration is being given to the case of the Railways, Dock Services and the supply and distribution of water and oil.2. The report has not yet been considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence, but the Secretary of State for Home Affairs has represented to me that it is important that he should be able to make an announcement in the House before the Recess on the subject of air raid precautionary measures by the Gas and Electricity Supply Industries. This would not be possible if the Report were to be considered in the first instance by the Committee of Imperial Defence.3. The Sub-Committee recommended, inter alia, that negotiations should be started between the Government Departments concerned and the two industries with a view to the preparation of adequate programmes of air raid precautionary measures.As regards the incidence of cost, the Sub-Committee consider that, in view of the special position of these industries, there are grounds for suggesting that they should bear the whole cost of such measures, but on balance they recommend that, provided the industries themselves contribute their proper share, contribu-tions from the Exchequer not exceeding  1,000,000 in the case of the Gas Industry and  1,500,000 in the case of the Electricity Supply Industry, should be made towards the cost of adequate programmes. These contributions would be in respect of special additional measures peculiar to the Gas and Electricity Industries and not the &apos;&apos; standard measures &apos;&apos; which are applicable to industry generally.4. As will be seen, the conclusions of the Sub-Committee cover a number of points, and I feel that the Cabinet would prefer to have the report considered in detail by the Committee of Imperial Defence in the first instance. I suggest, therefore, that consideration by the Cabinet should, for the moment, be restricted to the question referred to in the previous paragraph pending consideration of other matters in the report by the Committee of Imperial Defence.5. As regards an announcement in the House, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is clearly concerned. The wording of any public statement would have to be framed in the most general terms. In particular, I suggest that no mention should be made of the specific rates of grants for various services referred to in the report, nor of the total contributions which the Sub-Committee consider the Exchequer may have to face.(Initialled) T.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   December 1937.SECRET. CoPy No*P.Y.S. 7.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Sub-Committee on the Protection of Yital Services.INTERIM REPORT.WE were appointed on the 29th June, 1937, by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, with the following terms of reference :- &quot; To examine and report on the measures that should be taken, in time of peace, for the protection and maintenance in war of those public or essential services which are vital to the effective prosecution of war and the life of the community.&quot;Our appointment arose out of consideration by the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at its Meeting on the 8th April, 1937, of a preliminary estimate of the cost of measures to protect vital services submitted to it by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs.2. Following the suggestion in that Paper, we have so far confined ourselves to considering the following services : (a) Railway Services,(b) Dock Services,and the supply and distribution of -(c) Electricity,(d) Gas,(e) Water, (/) Oil.We understand that the terms of reference were not intended to cover munition factories or food factories or the like.Oil.3. As regards oil, the question of protection cannot well be separated from that of the size and location of stocks. We are aware that these latter questions are under consideration by the Sub-Committee on Petroleum Products Reserves and, at our request, this Sub-Committee is now to consider in the first instance the question of protective measures and their cost. The recommendations of the Sub-Committee on protection may no doubt be intermixed with recommendations on other allied topics, but we suggest, nevertheless, that we should be given an opportunity to review their suggestions so far as they relate to protection prior to their submission to the Committee of Imperial Defence, in order to ensure that they are in line generally with those which we shall make in regard to other vital services.
railways, Docks, Water.4. As regards these services, discussions between the Home Office (Air Raid Precautions Department) and the other Government Departments primarily concerned on the one hand, and the undertakings for the respective services on the other, have been steadily pursued since the date of our appointment, but it is clear that, in the case of Railway, Dock, and Water Undertakings, further preliminary information is required before we can formulate any useful recommendations. The collection of this information is actively in hand, although from the complicated nature of the problem the enquiries may take a considerable time to complete. On the other hand, the position in regard to electricity and gas is further advanced and, though it would have been convenient to deal with all public utilities together, we feel, in view of the lapse of time, that it is necessary to deal with these two industries at once.Gas.5. Certain particulars regarding the gas industry are set out in Appendix A to this Report, together with a preliminary estimate made by the four London Gas Companies of the cost of protective measures. It will be seen that these Companies estimate that the cost, so far as London is concerned, would amount to just under  2,000,000 and that, on a similar basis, the cost for the whole country might reach  7,000,000, although some  3,000,000 might be sufficient to deal with large undertakings in important centres.It is clear that these estimates are framed on an extravagant basis and go some way beyond any requirements for which the Government would be likely to press. The proposals in regard to the largest London company (the Gas Light and Coke Company) have been examined in detail by the Air Raid Precautions Department, and ii would appear that the industry&apos;s estimate for London could be approximately halved.Electricity.6. Similar particulars regarding the Electricity Supply Industry are set out in Appendix B. In this case the cost of protective measures for the whole country as estimated by the Electricity Commission (the statutory advisers of the Ministry of Transport in matters affecting the electricity supply industry), is  5,550,000, exclusive of the cost of measures referred to in paragraph 21 below, for the division of switch houses and transformers which, if carried out, might be very expensive. In this case also the Air Raid Precautions Department, who have scrutinised the proposals, are disposed to think, subject to further discussion with the Electricity Commission, that an expenditure, of considerably less than this sum would fulfil the essential requirements.Considerations arising from risk of attack.7. The question of the possibility and method of enemy air attacks on industrial targets has been discussed with a representative of the Air Staff. Whilst it is clearly impossible to come to any definite conclusions in the absence of experience in the actual conditions to be encountered, there appear to be good reasons for thinking that in strongly defended areas large and easily recognisable industrial targets, such as Gas Works and Electricity Generating Stations, are likely to be selected as objectives, and that in those cases they will be attractive to an enemy in proportion to the ease of recognition and the degree of disturbance which it is anticipated would be caused to vital factories or great centres of population by their destruction. In comparatively undefended areas less easily recognisable installations may be sought out if there is a sufficient object to be gained. For the rest, the risk of damage will arise from casual or misdirected bombs.8. It follows from these assumptions that, in considering the necessity for, and degree of, protective measiyres for a particular installation, regard must be paid to the size, ease of&quot; recognition and vulnerability of the building, the vulnerability of the district in which it is situated, the extent to which it is the sole or main source of power supply to vital industries, and the size and density of the population for whom a minimum skeleton service must necessarily be maintained.
These considerations will vary in some degree with every station, and a good deal more enquiry and survey is needed than has yet been carried out, in particular in regard both to the maintenance of supplies, and to the existence of alternative sources of supply, to factories engaged in a vital industry. Neverthe-less, investigations have proceeded far enough for negotiations with the gas and electric supply industries to be concurrently started, which should cover the major questions referred to in the following paragraphs : Measures recommended incidence of cost.9.   The measures which we propose to recommend fall into two categories : (a) the standard air raid precaution measures for factories which are set out in Air said Precautions Handbook No. 6, i.e., sandbagging and minor structural work, to provide resistance against penetration by small incendiary bombs, and by splinters or blast from high-explosive bombs falling not less than 50 feet away, and the provision of adequate fire-fighting arrangements.(6) special measures for additional protection to vital portions of the machinery for production and distribution, and for rapid replacement in the event of damage.10. As in the case of industrial undertakings generally, the cost of the standard precautions set out in paragraph 9 (a) above should be met by the Undertakers. In the case of electricity, the Electricity Commission has produced an estimate of some  3,500,000 for this service,-but here, again, the Air Raid Precautions Department think that reasonable requirements can be secured for a much smaller outlay.11. As regards the cost of the special measures, the arrangements now in process of completion between the Government and the local authorities furnish no analogy as to the amount, if any, which the Exchequer might reasonably contribute. In the case of local authorities, the cost had to be met, in any event, out of taxation, and the substantial question was whether it should be met out of central or local taxation. Although the settlement with local authorities will inevitably be quoted as a precedent, the comparison should be rejected from the outset.12. Some of these measures will be of definite benefit to the industries in peace time, and a further highly important consideration is that they may well enable the undertakings in war to continue in operation instead of being involved in very heavy losses. But there are other and wider considerations. The organisation of these industries is covered in the main by statute, and the various units in them are, within certain limits, granted by the State a monopoly in the particular areas or regions which they serve, although it is true that the monopoly is more complete in certain cases than in others, and that the financial condition and future prospects of the various industries also vary. There are grounds for suggesting that, as one of the conditions associated with this monopoly, the State could require the industries to provide, without Exchequer assistance, reasonable precautionary measures to guard against the risk of the interruption of their services in war. It would be no innovation to impose reasonable conditions upon these industries. They are at present required to comply with certain provisions, which no doubt involve extra cost, to minimise any danger to the consumer in time of peace.13. In so far as it became necessary to pass on the cost of precautionary measures to the consumer, the burden would fall on precisely those persons for whose benefit the measures were being taken. But, though further investigation into this is required, it is far from clear that it would be necessary or even practicable to pass on the cost, which, even at the largest figure so far contem-plated, when spread over the whole of the output of the industries represents a very small sum per unit of output. In the case of the electricity supply industry, for example, the annual charges on each million pounds&apos; worth of measures are estimated, if spread equally, to be of the order of -00105 pence per unit sold in 1936. A special position arises, however, in the case of the Central Electricity Board.   The Board has no margin of finance available to meet any appreciable
expenditure on the protection of their sub-stations, and it would require fresh statutory authority to enable them to pass on to their consumers the extra cost that would be involved.14. Moreover, the psychological effect that would follow the provision by an industry itself of all its air raid precaution measures must not be overlooked  nor, on the other hand, the adverse effect that would follow the grant of State subsidies. There is a great need to make every citizen in this country, including those at the head of large industrial and commercial organisations, more sensible of the need for air raid precaution measures and their own individual responsibility in regard to them. The grant of substantial State contributions to industries for the method of operation of which the State takes a considerable responsibility would diminish the hope of other industries operating on a competitive basis taking at their own&quot; expense any far-reaching precautionary steps. Yet there is no doubt that in some of the more important factories some measures over and above the bare standard minimum are very much to be desired, and the fact that certain industries had undertaken, or had been required to bear, the full cost themselves would furnish a valuable example for others to follow.15. Unfortunately formidable considerations exist on the other side. There are clear indications that all the public utility industries expect to receive Government assistance. The Railways can advance the argument that their concerns will obviously be taken over by the State in time of war and that accordingly the State should itself take what steps it considers desirable to render them safer in war conditions. Many public utility concerns are owned by Municipalities which have already stood out successfully against bearing a proper share of their burdens in another direction. Above all the liability will fall unequally upon different concerns and the State needs to keep a considerable directive and supervisory power over the whole proceedings. In these circum-stances we consider that it would be a waste of valuable time to attempt to persuade these bodies to undertake large and costly structural works at their own expense on. a scale and according to plans which would satisfy the Air Raid Precautions Department, nor do we think that Parliament would easily accept a proposal to take statutory powers to this end. Although it probably involves the corollary that in due course State assistance for ordinary industries may have to be given in special instances, we think that some State assistance for public utility undertakings must be contemplated.16. This assistance should apply exclusively to exceptional precautionary measures of a costly character and should be given only on condition that the industries themselves agreed to provide the balance for these measures as agreed with the Air Raid Precautions Department, to meet themselves the full cost of the standard measures and to complete the whole programme within a reasonable agreed period. It is on this basis that we recommend in the following paragraphs certain percentage rates of grant for the various special measures.17. &quot;We regard the scales of grant suggested as liberal, but it should be recognised that the industries concerned may refuse them. Once the principle of a Government contribution is admitted they may be disposed to stand out for an unreasonably high rate of grant and, in spite of the false analogy, they will no doubt have in their minds the final figures in the case of Local Authorities. It may be, therefore, that in the end compulsion by some form of legislation will be required. We think that the negotiators on behalf of the Government should from the outset have this fact clearly in mind and should, if and when the necessity arises, indicate it to the industries concerned with a further intimation that the rate of grant fixed by statute need not correspond with that offered in negotiations to avoid the need for legislation.Special Measures : Gas Industry.18. We are satisfied that, subject to the observations in paragraph 8, steps should be taken to provide for some duplication of certain vital production or distribution plant, and for the linking up, where reasonably practicable, of existing distribution systems.
19. The suggestions put forward by the industry for standby plant run to very high figures and contemplate in some cases the provision of such plant on the premises of the gas works. We think - that there would be considerable advantage, both from the point of view of vulnerability and the most efficient use of such reserve plant as it may prove practicable to provide, if pools of standard equipment were formed away from the works, on which the companies could draw as required. By this method it would be possible to avoid putting standby plant at gas stations save in quite exceptional circumstances and thus escape the very real risk that the standby plant might be damaged by the same bomb that put the original plant out of action. Some part of the need might be met by inducing both manufacturers and undertakers to hold larger stocks. This method is subject to the qualification that additional stocks in the hands of manu-facturers will not necessarily be of service if they are of a kind needed also by the fighting services and liable to requisition for such use, but it should be adopted as far as possible. The financial arrangements should be on similar lines to those suggested for the corresponding but larger need in the electricity industry see paragraph 21 below.20. In addition to the foregoing there will be need for the erection of standby plant in exceptional cases; the London Gas Companies mains need to be linked; and a variety of improvements in the distribution system need to be undertaken. For measures of this kind we feel that it might be necessary to make a Government grant of perhaps 60 per cent, of the cost to the undertakings.Special Measures : Electricity Supply Industry.21. In the case of this industry the investigations have not proceeded as far as in the case of the gas industry and much more enquiry in consultation with the industry is necessary. But the general lines which special precautionary measures, over and above ordinary Air Raid Precaution measures, should follow can already be appreciated with some confidence. The most important of these special measures, where physical and other conditions permit, is the division into at least two separate buildings of the principal switch houses and trans-formers situated near the principal generating stations; and, combined with this, there should be multiple connections between the grid and the local distribution network. The division of switch houses has a definite peace-time value as an insurance against the danger of lengthy interruption of supply in the event of breakdown in a switch house. The practice of division is now, we under -stand, being followed in new stations and in cases where a switch house has been burnt out or for other reasons requires to be replaced. Although even approximate figures as to the cost of these measures are not available without further examination it is clear that the sums involved are substantial, and we feel that some Government assistance may be necessary to secure early and extensive progress with this very necessary work of reconstruction. We recommend that the industry might, where necessary, be offered a Government grant not exceeding 40 per cent.22. Improvements in the local distribution network and sub-stations should be necessary only in exceptional cases to ensure supply to vital undertakings where the existing supply is highly vulnerable : in these cases Government assistance may also have to be given at a high rate.23. Proposals have been formulated by the industry for a national reserve of switch gear and transformers in convenient centres for immediate transference to points where damage had been done. A reserve of this character would, it is claimed, frequently enable interruption in supply due to a direct hit to be rectified very swiftly instead of after a delay of some weeks. This national reserve would constitute an insurance for the continuation of profitable working in war time, but to the extent that it is necessary a substantial Government contribution would be needed before the voluntary co-operation of the industry could be expected. In the first instance an effort should be made to secure agreement on the basis of an Exchequer grant in the region of 50 per cent. Arrangements would require to be concerted for ensuring Government part-ownership of the stores. A preliminary estimate of the cost of this reserve has been provisionally assessed by the Electricity Commission at  1,500,000, but exploration is proceeding and it
is hoped that it will be materially reduced. In view of the probable large cost of this proposal to the Exchequer the Treasury should be kept in close touch with any negotiations that may take place in regard to it.Basis of Negotiations.24. It is impossible, until the investigations and discussions have proceeded much further, to frame a close estimate of the cost of all the necessary works for the two industries, but we think the aim should be to secure agreements with the industries for adequate programmes (the industries themselves bearing their proper share) at a cost to the Exchequer not exceeding  1,000,000 in the case of the gas industry, and  1,500,000 of the electricity supply industry.25. We recommend, therefore, that negotiations on the basis of this report should be started at once with representatives of the two industries. They should be carried out by the Department which is accustomed to deal with the particular industry concerned jointly with the Home Office (Air Raid Precautions Department), i.e., by the Board of Trade jointly with the Home Office for gas, and the Ministry of Transport (through the Electricity Commission) jointly with the Home Office for electricity. The Scottish Office should be kept informed by these Departments in the case of undertakings in Scotland. The negotiators should keep in touch with the Treasury, and the Government should not be committed to larger expenditure than above indicated without further Treasury authority.26. In addition to the cost of the measures covered by this report, the question of protection to these and other &apos;&apos; vital service &apos;&apos; undertakings has aspects which may arise from time to time in connection with other defence problems. We assume that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence will make such arrangements as he thinks necessary for further co-ordination between negotiations on the points covered by this Report and other negotiations of a similar kind. As regards the measures with which we are directly concerned, this Committee must for the present remain in being and might, if desired, be further continued as a Standing Sub-Committee to review the progress made in the various industries, to deal with any general policy questions that may arise, and to report from time to time as necessary to the Committee of Imperial Defence.Control over Design of New Factories.27. Before summarising our conclusions we wish to draw attention to a further question of considerable importance. In paragraph 8 we have made some observations on the vulnerability of vital factories to air attack in time of war. These considerations raise at once the question whether compulsory powers should now be obtained to secure that, at least in the case of all large new vital factories, their size, situation and design should conform to requirements imposed by reference to the question of vulnerability to air attack. This question is especially important in the case of a large and growing industry such as electricity, but it has a wider aspect and is not limited to public utility companies. It may arise in regard to many types of industry of special importance in war time, such as steel works or flour mills, and, indeed, it applies in some degree to a large range of industrial establishments since continuity in the industrial life of the country during war will be an important factor in maintaining the morale of the country.28. Certain aspects of this question have already been before the Committee of Imperial Defence, which, at their 286th Meeting on the 17th December, 1936, increased the composition of the &quot; Sub-Committee of the Home Defence Committee on the Protection of points of Importance against Air Attack &quot; and widened its terms of reference to include, inter alia: &quot;       * * .     * * * *(ii) To survey the position of undertakings in the more vulnerable areas likely to be vital in the chain of armament production or as regards civil needs in time&apos; of emergency, and, where necessary, to make recom-mendations for minimising the danger to the community if they were put out of action.
(iii) To serve as a pool of information about new undertakings or extensions of existing units likely to be of importance from the point of view of war potential.(iv) To act as a liaison body with industry generally on the question oflocation in relation to defence.&quot;The question is also related to the matters being studied by the Royal Commission on the Location of Industry.29. We understand that the powers of the Sub-Committee are as limited as its terms of reference are wide; the report of the Royal Commission on Location of Industry cannot be expected for many months, and we have no knowledge how far it may touch upon the actual questions we have raised. The problem extends beyond our present terms of reference, but we are disposed to suggest that it might receive very early attention either from a separate body set up for the purpose or by this Sub-Committee with extended terms of reference and suitably reinforced for this purpose by experienced members of the industrial world.Conclusions.30.   We summarise our conclusions as follows :-(a) The vital public or essential services are regarded as limited to railways,docks, and the supply and distribution of electricity, gas, water and oil (paragraph 2).(b) The latter is at present being considered by the Sub-Committee onPetroleum Products Reserves. We suggest that we should be given an opportunity to review their recommendations in regard to protection (paragraph 3).(c) Further preliminary investigation is required in regard to Railways,Docks and water undertakings before useful recommendations can be made. Owing to its complicated nature this may take some time (paragraph 4).(d) An estimate of the cost of air raid precautions for the gas industry basedon the London Gas Companies&apos; estimates of their own needs works out at  7,000,000 for the whole country. The basis of this estimate is clearly extravagant (paragraph 5).(e) For the electricity industry the figure is  5,550,000 plus an unspecifiedfigure in respect of certain major structural alterations (paragraph 21) which may be heavy. Some reduction of the figure of  5.550,000 is probable (paragraph 6). (/) In view of the probable form of attack the following factors should be taken in account in assessing the need for and degree of protection for a particular installation: Size, ease of recognition and vulnerability of the building, the vulnerability of the area, the extent to which it is the sole or main source of power for vital industries, the size and density of the population dependent on it for a minimum skeleton service (paragraph 8).(g) Precautionary  measures  recommended  for  the  gas  and  electricity industries fall into two categories: (i) the standard measures applicable to industry generally and (ii) special additional measures peculiar to the gas and electricity industries. The cost of the former should be met by the industry concerned (paragraphs 9 and 10).(h) As regards the cost of the special measures the arrangements concluded with the local authorities furnish no sound analogy. There are &apos; grounds for suggesting that the industries should bear the whole cost. On the other hand the undertakings are known to be strongly opposed to such a course and statutory powers would have to be obtained. In view of these and other difficulties we recommend that some State assistance should be provided towards the cost of the special measures on condition that the industries themselves meet the cost of normal measures as agreed with the Home Office (Air Raid Precautions Department) and complete the Avhole programme within a reasonable agreed period (paragraphs 11-17).(i) For the gas industry we recommend, subject to the considerations at (/)in regard to each particular undertaking, the provision of stand-by

For these measures we recommend a grant of 50 per cent, or perhaps 60 per cent, of the cost, according to the type of case (paragraphs 18-20).(j) For the electricity industry we recommend the division, where physical and other conditions admit, into separate buildings of the principal switch houses and transformers near the principal generating stations, and the multiplication of the connections between the grid and the local distribution network. For these measures we recommend a grant not exceeding 40 per cent, of the cost (paragraph 21).(k) Improvements in the local distribution systems should only be required exceptionally. In such cases a high rate of grant may prove necessary (paragraph 22).(I) A proposal to establish a reserve of switchgear and transformers in convenient centres is being further explored. We recommend that in the first instance an attempt should be made to secure agreement on the basis of an Exchequer grant in the region of 50 per cent, (paragraph 23).(m) The aim should be to secure adequate programmes (the industries bearing their proper share) at a cost to the Exchequer not exceeding  1,000.000 for gas and  1,500,000 for electricity (paragraph 24).(n) Negotiations on the above basis should be started between the Govern-ment Departments concerned and representative bodies of the gas and electricity industries. The Government should not be committed to larger contributions than those set out above without Treasury authority (paragraph 25).(o) The Sub-Committee will remain in being for the consideration of the cases of the remaining public and essential services. It might thereafter be continued as a Standing Sub-Committee to review progress, to deal with policy and to report as necessary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (paragraph 26).(p) Our conclusions raise the question whether compulsory powers should now be obtained to secure that large new vital factories conform in size, situation and design to the requirements imposed by vulnerability to air attack. &quot;We are disposed to suggest that this problem might receive early attention either by our Sub-Committee suitably reinforced or by some special ad hoc body (paragraphs 27-29).Signed on behalf of the Committee :R.

APPENDIX A.AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS AND THE GAS INDUSTRY.Structure of the Industry.1. THERE are about 715 authorised gas undertakings in Great Britain, the great majority of which belong to the National Gas Council, an organisation formed by the gas industry to look after its interests and to consider matters affecting the industry       whole.Of these authorised undertakings : &apos;Some 90 produce 1,000 million cubic feet or more per annum.Some 65 produce 500-1,000 million cubic feet per annum.Some 80 produce 250-500 million cubic feet per annum.Some 170 produce 100-250 million cubic feet per annum.2. The typical unit consists of a works, producing gas in retorts for coal, and a distribution network, with the area served entirely dependent on the continued functioning of the works because of the absence of connections with neighbouring undertakings.3. In the North of England gas is obtained in some areas by gas undertakings as a by-product from coke ovens.London is served by four main companies, with inter-connections between most of the works of each company but no connections between the networks of the companies. Further, 36 per cent, of the- production of the main London company the Gas Light and Coke Company is concentrated in Beckton Gas Works on the north bank of the Thames below Barking.4. There are a few short distance inter-connections in the country, e.g., between Sheffield and Rotherham. There is, however, nothing in this country corresponding to the gas grid serving the industrial areas of Western Germany,Importance of the Industry.5.   In London, approximately 10 per cent, of the supply is used for industrial . undertakings,* 10 per cent, for lighting and 80 per cent, for domestic heating and cooking.  The chief consumers in industry are metal works, glass works, including electric bulb manufacture, baking and biscuit manufacturers, catering establish-ments and printing presses.6. The percentage of output used industrially varies considerably. In Coventry 35 per cent, is used for industrial purposes, in Sheffield 62 per cent, and in Newcastle-upon-Tyne 30 per cent. In London itself, it varies from 4 per cent, in Wandsworth to 20 per cent, in Leyton.7. As regards by-products, the continued operation of gas works is essential for the production of benzole, toluol, phenol, napthalene, naptha, xylene, pyridine and creosote. Some of these products, for example, are made in greater or less amounts by all the London Gas Companies, the Gas Light and Coke Company producing them all. In war time the country would be more dependent than in peace time upon the gas industry for the production of such by-products, some of which would be required in greater quantities.Vulnerability of Gas Undertakings.8. Works vary considerably in lay-out. In some works buildings and plant are well dispersed, while others are very congested. The point is important in connection with proposals for duplicating plant, since on a congested site a direct hit might destroy both the main plant and any standby plant which had been installed. A detailed appreciation of the vulnerability of different parts of a gas works is set out in Annex I.9.   The distribution system is everywhere vulnerable to direct hits.* The percentage is subject to the qualification that it includes non-industrial consumers who buy in bulk.
Air Raid Precautions Steps so far Taken.10. The Air Raid Precautions Department, in October 1936, published a short confidential memorandum (&quot; Air Raid Precautions for Gas Under-takings &quot;) which was circulated by the National Gas Council to all undertakings.11. The London Gas Companies formed at the beginning of 1936 a Committee to consider the precautionary measures which should be taken to safe-guard gas supplies in London. Meetings were held in January and June 1936, between this London Committee and representatives of the Air Raid Precautions Department and of the Board of Trade. The London Committee produced an estimate of  1,923,642 for precautionary measures, in respect of the four main London companies.12. The Chairman of the London Committee in May 1937 informed the Air Raid Precautions Department that the London Companies would take no further action to maintain the gas supply of London under war conditions without financial assistance from the Government, but that the companies had agreed to spend money on saving life and reducing distress, by (a) accumulating stocks of materials, such as clay, sand, sand-bags, timber,and materials for making buildings gas-proof.(b) training employees in anti-gas measures and in methods of dealing withdamage to plant and personnel resulting from air raids.(c) additions of staff and equipment for improving the fire fighting arrange-ments in their works.13. In April 1937 the National Gas Council, at the invitation of the Air Raid Precautions Department, called together a Committee consisting of repre-sentatives of gas undertakings throughout the country to consider further the precautionary measures which should be taken. The Committee has met twice, and some material for a revised edition of the confidential memorandum was brought together. The Committee has, however, indicated that, while gas undertakings are prepared to go on with organisation and training, no progress on construction works can be expected without financial assistance from the Government.14. In the meantime, in 1936, the Board of Trade furnished a list of 34 gas undertakings which could be regarded as &quot;vital points,&quot; which, if destroyed, would cripple the nation&apos;s war effort. This list, however, is not necessarily conclusive. It includes simply the largest undertakings serving densely populated industrial areas. It does not, for example, cover gas under-takings serving vital factories or civil establishments.15. A considerable number of the 34 undertakings listed have been inspected. For the most part the Inspectors confined themselves to recommendations for protecting vital parts of existing plant, where possible, by bricking up windows or by erecting concrete traverses or sand-bag walling. These recommendations, which are not costly, have been communicated to the undertakings inspected, but it is understood that very little progress has so far been made. Replies received indicate great reluctance to incur any expenditure. *16. In the case of 12 out of 30 undertakings surveyed the Inspecting Officers recommended the installation of anti-aircraft machine guns, as a protection against low-flying attack. If this course is adopted the responsibility for their installation and manning would rest with the War Office, although it is hoped the actual personnel would be employees of the undertaking enlisted in the Territorial Army. ; &apos;London Companies&apos; Estimate for London.17. The London Companies produced an estimate of  1,923,642 for the main-tenance of London gas supplies in time of war. The estimate may best be set out in relation to a single works (Fulham), one company (the Gas Light and Coke Company), and the four London Companies. The items are in the order of priority in which they are regarded by the Companies.

The proposal is for a single new unit of pumping plant, located at a distance from the existing units and with mains using different routes.In all gas works the stream of gas from the individual producing units converge into single streams at the outlet of meters, and in the supplies to and from the gas holders, gas drying and benzole recovery processes. At Beckton Gas Works, for instance, all the gas made on the works, amounting at full load to 115 million cubic feet per day, passes through one length of main 7 feet in diameter on its way to the gas holders. If by-pass mains were installed, damage to these points of concentration would not interrupt the supply of gas, and in the event of a gas holder being severely damaged, the flow of gas could be diverted until the connections were restored.The object of these measures is to ensure continuity of operations (and safety in the case of fire) in the event of the present sources being damaged. In some works, stand-by electricity would be taken from the public mains, in others ring cables would be provided.On many works, the whole of the gas exhausting plant is, for economy in operation and better control, concentrated in one building. The proposal is to erect in such cases alternative stand-by machines in a different location.I (See No. 3.)The principal mains linking up the several gas works of each under-taking and certain of the principal feeder mains are at present valved only at bridges, subways, &amp;c. The proposal provides for the insertion of valves at half a mile intervals on the main lines to obtain a quicker closing down in the event of damage, to avoid burning gas and to render repair more rapid.?N9

London Companies&apos; Estimate for Whole Country.18. The London Companies consider that the cost in proportion to output in industrial areas outside London would probably be the same as in London, though the linking of one company to another would not generally arise. The London output is 27 per cent, of that of the country as a whole, which would give a figure of approximately  7,000,000 for the whole country, including London. A smaller figure say  3,000,000 would cover large undertakings in important centres.Observations on London Companies&apos; Estimate. Inspecting officers&apos; Survey.19. The Inspecting Officers reported that, even if the premises on which the Companies&apos; estimates were formed were accepted, the proposed expenditure admitted of substantial reduction. Thus, as regards the Gas, Light and Coke Companies&apos; works, they suggested : (a) that by careful examination of the needs of each station the total for items 1-6 and 9 could be reduced from  900,800 to about  300,000;(b) that items 7 and 11 (which affect distribution) should stand at  212,400;(c) that item 8 (mains linking companies) should stand at  71,000;(d) that very considerable reductions could be made in items 13 and 14.20. The proposals of the London Gas Companies have been further scrutinised by the Air Raid Precautions Department, and the following comments made : (a) The Companies&apos; proposals amount to an attempt to provide for an almostnormal peace-time gas supply under war conditions.(b) Double protection is provided against direct hits from high explosive bombs. Not only are all vital parts duplicated in each works; but the linking of companies&apos; systems, taken with the existing interconnections between each company&apos;s works, makes the continued working of individual works relatively less essential.(c) Measures for protecting plant, as distinct from measures for duplicatingplant, are disregarded. Protective measures are much less costly than duplication of plant.(d) The proposals do not cover the by-product plant as indicated inparagraph 7, the by-products are of great importance.(e) If domestic lighting and heating and gas by-products were not regardedas vital, the problem can be resolved into considering how much expenditure is necessary to ensure a continuous supply on a greatly reduced scale in the centres where gas is necessary for important industries, e.g., Sheffield and Coventry. (/) On congested sites stand by plants serve no useful purpose, as the effects of a direct hit anywhere on the site would be disastrous. Consequently, plans for the duplication of plant should only be considered at vital works with a dispersed layout.(g) Priority of importance should be given to precautions for the distributionof gas, rather than for production plant;(h) Prices of material are higher to-day than when the estimate was prepared.21. On the basis of this examination, the estimated cost of reasonable air raid precautions for the gas industry in London would be of the order of  1,000,000.
Vulnevability of Gas Works,1. The process plants, holders, carbonizing and coal handling plant at gas-works are large units entirely unprotected. The rest of the plant for power, pumping, &amp;c, is generally housed in substantial buildings capable of further protection. Some of the process plants can be by-passed in an emergency. In most works there are various streams of gas production so that although some were put out of action, the rest could be operated. As a general rule the power plants are also duplicated.2. Retort Plant.-Th.is plant is usually situated in well-built, thick brick buildings, and in batteries of several units of vertical inclined or horizontal retorts. In the majority of cases the retort houses include waste heat boilers, on which the mechanical devices depend partly for power. The most vital part is the coal and coke mechanically operated handling gear for substitution of labour and for which in the more modern works there is no alternative. Such gear is usually exposed, but not very vulnerable to fire or splinters.Recently constructed retort houses are less substantial than the old ones, but the plant itself gives less indication of the nature of the work going on, as the coke is drawn and quenched continuously without steam or glare being visible.Little protection other than traverses for openings would be worth under-taking. It is not considered likely that all the units would be put out of action by any one direct hit.3. Steam Plant. So many processes and so much of the handling of the material during manufacture is dependent on the mechanical devices that the power plant is vitul to the undertaking. In the older works, steam, gas and hydraulic power is employed, but electrically driven machines are increasing in the more modern ones. Even when the motive power is electric, steam has to be generated for the dynamo-engines, and while in some cases gas engines are still used, these are becoming obsolescent and held only as stand-by plant of small capacity only; in no case has alternative electric power been obtained fully from adjacent electric power companies.The boiler houses vary somewhat in their security and concentration; but in most works the initial steam is generated in waste heat boilers in, or adjacent to, the retort houses, while the separate boilers are used together or in batteries dispersed over the works. The buildings for boilers vary considerably, the majority being in well-built brick buildings, while some are in light shelters, but in all cases the roofs are of the lightest construction.A good deal of protection could be afforded to the buildings by traverses for openings and revetments for the less substantial houses.The pipe mains conveying steam to the various machines are generally in the open and vulnerable, but are in a linked ring and easily repairable.4. Power Plants. In order to economise space it has been found that electric or hydraulic power plant is often housed in the same building as the exhauster plant or gas pump houses. The older types of buildings usually have 14-inch brick pillars with thinner brick panels, but windows have been generously spaced and the roofs are of the lightest type. A great deal of protection could be given by making openings and windows splinter-proof to the height of the machinery.The units requiring power, whether steam, gas, hydraulic or electric, are generally dispersed throughout the works and are fed through the medium of pipes or cables which, although often above ground level, are in a ring system, and comparatively easily repaired.        -   -5. Eoohauster Plant. This plant is essential and vital. As stated in the previous paragraph, it is often housed-in the building in which the power plant is located. The exhausters with their engines are, like the electric generators, of no great height, so that splinter proof protection of sufficient height could be easily built around the thinner parts of the walls and openings.ANNEX I.
6. Condensers, Extractors, Scmbbers and Washers. This type of plant is generally in the open and very little protection could be made to save it against splinters, but valves could be protected at little cost.7. Purifiers. The date of installation seems to be the factor for placing the purifiers below ground or in the open. Little can be done to ensure their safety against splinters. Much of the plant is on ground level or a little below and not very vulnerable.8. Meters. There seems to be a divergence of opinion as to whether this indication of the pulse in the manufacture of gas can be safely dispensed with, but on the whole it is not considered that the meters are essential for gas making, and could be by-passed. In some cases this can be done now without alteration to plant.9. Naphthalene Extraction Plant.- This plant is frequently in the open and, in some cases, covered with wooden structures that keep the plant at an even temperature.10. Benzole Recovery Plant. To maintain the working of this plant, it would be necessary to isolate it as far as possible by bunds, because of the extra fire risk involved in extraction.11. Water Pumps. The location of the water pumps or compressors from wells varies a good deal, and in some cases pumps are in houses with other machines and would be protected by whatever arrangements were made for that machinery.   Splinter proof protection can be provided cheaply.12. Gas Holders. Excepting relief gas holders, which are essential in connection with the water gas making plant, holders are not vitally necessary for the supply of gas for immediate local consumption and could be by-passed if damaged. Holders are virtually balancers of the flow of gas and act as reservoirs of supply during a slack period of gas making, every 24-hour day.It is not thought that the normal water-sealed holder is of very great danger if holed by splinters or even fired. The waterless holder might, however, be a grave source of danger if high explosive and incendiary bombs produced circum-stances which would cause explosive mixture to generate and ignite. There can be no effective means of protecting gas holders, which, by reason of their bulk and height, are outstanding identification marks. Camouflage might reduce this feature.13. Booster Plant. The gas pumps are most vital to long-distance supply and are normally placed on the distribution side of the holders, but in some cases, notably Beckton and Southall, boosters may be found in the gas stream between the producing plant and the holder. Boosters are located also at holder stations. If the holders are intact a pressure may be maintained for local distribution by the action of the holder without the additional power given by the pumps, but it is doubtful whether this would be sufficient for long-distance supply or local distribution when the weight of the holder is low. These pumping plants are housed in buildings very similar to those of the exhauster pumps and could be made splinter proof. The buildings of the newer plants are less substantial and in all cases the roofs are of light construction only.14. Mains, Pipe Lines and Valves. The layout of the mains conducting the gas stream through the processes of gas making in the works to the distribution point is usually somewhat complex, depending a great deal on the size of the area and position of the various units in the works. The pipes carrying the gas stream from one set of plant to another are with few exceptions below ground level, together with their valves, and excepting those portions above ground are vulnerable only to direct hits.
APPENDIX B.AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS FOR THE ELECTRICITY supply industry.Structure of the Industry.1. The Electricity Commissioners are appointed by and responsible to the Minister of Transport. They are an administrative body constituted by Parlia-ment for promoting, regulating and supervising the supply of electricity through-out Great Britain. They have jurisdiction in a variety of technical and other matters over all authorised electricity undertakers, both companies and public authorities including the Central Electricity Board.The Central Electricity Board (also appointed by the Minister and consti-tuted by Parliament) are charged with the executive control of the wholesale generation of electricity and its disposal in bulk to the various authorised under-takers (companies and public authorities) through the medium of the National Grid system constructed and owned by the Board.2. Electricity for public supply is generated in about 427 stations in Great Britain, some of which operate only during part of a year according to the demand. There are 137 &quot;selected&quot; stations which constitute the main source (about 85 per cent.) of supply to the Central Electricity Board&apos;s Grid. 24 of these stations, each generating over 200 million units annually, supply 61 per cent, of the total energy. The remaining stations may export energy to the Grid or receive energy from the latter to supplement local requirements.3. The grid system covers all the important parts of the country and all undertakings of any size are connected to it either directly or indirectly. The Central Electricity Board purchases all energy exported to its system and sells it to the local supply undertakings, including those from whom it is derived, for their own purposes. This process involves transformation by the Board in their own substations, which often adjoin the undertakers&apos; premises, and by the under-takers themselves in order to bring the supply to a suitable voltage for distribution. The undertakers maintain the distribution network of substations and mains required for this purpose.Air Raid Precautions Steps so far Taken.4. The Air Raid Precautions Department in October 1936 published a short confidential memorandum (&quot;Air Raid Precautions for Electricity Under-takings&quot;) which was circulated by the Electricity Commission to all undertakings.Following the publication of this memorandum and a general conference of the interested parties, the Electricity Commission called together a Committee consisting of representatives of the Electricity Commission, Air Raid Precautions Department and Electricity Supply Industry to examine in detail the precau-tionary measures which should be taken to protect electricity supplies under air raid conditions. After a preliminary survey of the position, the National Committee considered the measures of precautions required in the electricity supply industry on the basis of which a revised draft of the confidential memo-randum which was prepared by the Air Raid Precautions Department. This revised draft is now practically ready for issue. The National Committee also appointed a sub-committee, which has not yet reported, to consider the standard forms which switch gears and transformers intended as reserves should take. The Committee will probably be kept in-existence after it has completed its present tasks in order to consider, from time to time, questions affecting the whole industry.5. The revised confidential memorandum will be sent out to all electricity supply undertakings as&apos; a basis for their preparations, and it may be desirable, at a later stage, to set up regional committees to advise individual undertakings on the measures to be taken, and to ensure co-ordination within each area. A final decision on the proposal to set up regional committees has not yet been taken.
6. In the meantime, the fifty most important generating stations have been visited by inspecting officers attached to the Sub-Committee of the Home Defence Committee (Committee of Imperial Defence) set up to survey vital establishments which, if destroyed, would cripple the nation&apos;s war effort.7. For the most part, the recommendations of the inspecting officers have been confined to the protection of vital parts of existing plant by bricking up windows or by erecting concrete or sandbag walls or traverses, also general measures of protection, such as the darkening of the colours of cooling towers and concrete surfaces. These recommendations, which are not costly, have been transmitted to the undertakings inspected. It is so far too early to form any general conclusions how far the undertakings are prepared to carry out the recommendations made to them. In a few cases they have been implemented or a promise has been given that they will be implemented. In others no reply has been received. In others it has been made clear that no capital expenditure will be incurred.8. Apart from the restricted set of measures referred to in paragraph 6, the inspecting officers, in their reports to the Home Defence Committee, have drawn attention to wider questions such as the need to split up switch houses and to locate them at some distance from the generating station. Further reference is made to this in paragraphs 19 to 21.9. In the case of 21 out of 35 undertakings surveyed the inspecting officers recommended the installation of anti-aircraft machine guns as a protection against low flying attack. If this course is adopted the responsibility for their installation and manning would rest with the War Office, although it is hoped the actual personnel would be employees of the undertaking enlisted in the Territorial Army. Each set of equipment with ammunition will cost  17,000 to provide.Protection of Electricity Supply. 10.   The Protection of electricity supply can be examined under five heads:  (1) Generating Stations.(2) Connections of Selected Generating Stations to the Grid. (3) The Grid.(4) Local Distribution Network (including Sub-Stations). (5) National Reserve of Switchgear and Transformers.Generating Stations.11. The existence of the grid has made individual selected stations less vital, and the Central Electricity Board has estimated that it could continue supplies in the London area, even if three of the nine main generating stations in London were destroyed.12. At the same time, it has to be borne in mind that the grid is but a connecting link, and that the generating stations are the sources of power. It is possible that the enemy might concentrate attack on power stations and try to do permanent damage to as many of them as possible. The protection of generating stations is accordingly of the first importance.13. The standard of protection advocated by the Home Office (Air Raid Precautions Department) is similar to that recommended for industrial establish-ments generally, i.e., resistance to penetration by small incendiary bombs, or by splinters or blast from high explosive bombs falling not less than 50 feet away; and adequate fire fighting arrangements. The cost of providing protection against a direct hit by a high explosive bomb is in practice so high that it cannot be recommended.14. Other minimum essential requirements are : an adequate supply of spares for the repair of damage, protected accommodation for the staff, and equipment (such as respirators) for the staff and for the various services (decontamination, first aid, fire fighting, &amp;c). These services should be placed on an organised footing in peace time.15.   The Chief Engineer of the Birmingham Electricity Department has estimated that the cost of a scheme on the above lines for the two main generating stations at Birmingham would be about  10,000 for Princes Station and  7,500 [16225] d
for Hams Hall Station. The estimate of the Air Raid Precautions Department for the Princes Station, however, amounts to about  4,000 only.16 The Electricity Commission have estimated the cost of air raid precautions for generating stations at  2,700,000, made up as follows 120 major generating stations at  10,000 each ... 1,200,000 300 minor stations at  5,000 each.........      1,500,0002,700,00017. The cost per station in the above calculation appears to be based on the Birmingham figures. It is, of course, impossible to give reliable estimates until the best methods of protecting generating stations have been approved and considered in relation to the principal stations in the country; but, having regard to the margin between the estimates in the case of the Birmingham station referred to in paragraph 15, there are grounds for thinking that the cost for the whole country as estimated by the Electricity Commission is capable of some reduction. It should be noted that this total is based on providing the same degree of protection for all stations in the same category regardless of their location:18. The Electricity Commission consider that the electricity industry may not willingly accept financial responsibility for measures on which the above estimates are framed, except in the case of local measures of protection, such as fire barriers, oil drains, and fire-fighting equipment which have been shown to have a definite peace-time value.Connections between the Grid and Selected Generating Stations.19. At present, in many selected stations, supplies from the generating station to the grid pass through, and are controlled in, a switch-house which also houses the switchgear for interconnecting the grid to the local distribution network. Accordingly, if the switch-house is destroyed, the local distribution network can be fed neither from the generating stations nor from the grid, and the same arrangement obtains at most of the non-selected stations. The point has been illustrated in peace-time, through fires in switch-houses; Thus Bradford in 1936 was deprived of all electricity supplies for several days on account of a switch-house fire.20. The remedy in the case of future or reconstructed switch-houses lies in the division of switch-houses into at least two sections some distance apart and in multiple connections between the grid.and the local distribution network. It is difficult to give an estimate of the cost of dividing and separating switch-houses and of an additional connection with the Grid : but figures varying between  20,000 and  100,000 for each case may be expected. This estimate relates only to new and reconstructed switch-houses. As this work must, to some extent, depend on the peace-time needs of the industry, it is difficult to give any estimate of the extent to which this work is likely to be undertaken in the next few years.21. The largest undertakings, as for instance those supplying London, Birmingham and the North-East coast, are already connected to the grid at more than one point and a policy of separating and sub-dividing switch-houses is already being pursued. The undivided switch-house probably constitutes the major risk in normal supply arrangements and it is expected that the natural development of undertakings will be in this direction with advantage to both the peace and war-time interests. Financial assistance may be justified as a means of accelerating what will otherwise be a gradual and slow process.The Grid.22. The transmission lines of the Central Electricity Board do not afford a target on which extensive material damage is likely to be done. The Board will require, and no doubt already possess, adequate spares of cables and of small transformers and have the necessary trained staff.23. The Electricity Commission estimate the cost of protecting the Board&apos;s sub-stations at  750,000, the figure, being based on an average cost of  6,000 at 125 points of supply. They state that they have no reason to believe that the Board would be prepared to undertake this expenditure.
24. The advent of the Grid system arrested the progress of interconnections between undertakings and there has since been little reason for pursuing that policy except where supplies are required at a pressure intermediate between the Grid voltage and the local distribution voltage. There may, however, be cases where interconnections of this character would have the effect of supplementing the connection to the Grid1 and enhancing the stability of supply.Local Distribution Network.25. The local distribution network of an undertaking consists of sub-stations, lines, and cables, either above or below ground.26. The Electricity Commission estimate that  500,000 is needed as an overall figure for precautionary measures at sub-stations, and  100,000 for spares and equipment to repair the distribution network.27. A special aspect of the same problem is the vulnerability of electricity supply to vital undertakings. A Service establishment or a private factory which supplies material essential for war purposes may be dependent on a single source of electricity supply conveyed to the establishment in a single long cable. A preliminary survey has been made, which shows that out of 65 private factories on the lists of the Vital Points Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, 2 are dependent on a single cable to the factory sub-station, 21 have more than one cable, but are dependent on the integrity of the main switchgear of the electricity undertakings and 13 are dependent on their own generating plant.  The matter is still being investigated.National Reserve of Stviichgear and Transformers.28. The National Air Raid Precautions Committee for the Electricity Supply Industry has appointed a sub-committee to examine a proposal for a national reserve of switchgear and transfoimer equipment, which would be stored at convenient centres and mounted on crocodile trucks for immediate transference to points where damage had been done. A reserve of this character would enable interruption in supply due to a direct hit to be rectified in a day or so, instead of several weeks as at present.29. The Electricity Commission have estimated the cost of this proposal at  1,500,000, made up as follows :   100 units of switchgear at  5,000 each   ......      500,000Transformers: 1,000,000 K.V.A. aggregate capacityat (say) 10s. per K.V.A. .........       500,000Connecting cables, overhead line connections, pro-tective gear, transport, &amp;c.      ...       ...       ...      500,000As specifications of these units are still under consideration, the figures of prices put forward are necessarily provisional.30. It can be assumed that the industry is not at present prepared to meet the cost of building up a reserve of this character.Summary.31. The tentative estimate prepared by the Electricity Commission of the cost of air raid precautions for the electricity supply industry amounts, accordingly, to  5,550,000, made up as follows :  (1) Generating Stations...............      2,700,000(2) Connections between the Grid and selected stations (No estimate available)(3) The Grid      ...............      ...        750,000(4) Local Distribution Network       .........        600,000(5) National Reserve of Switchgear and transformers      1,500,0005,550,000
