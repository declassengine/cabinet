(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-Copy NoSECRET.CABINET. CP.279 (37) ---WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION BILL (BILL-10 ). .Memorandum by the Home Seoretary.The Labour Party are on this occasion putting forward a much less comprehensive and revolutionary measure than their Bill for State insurance and State administration which was rejected after Seoond Reading Debate in 1933 and again twice last year.    &apos;Their hope appears to be to enlist sufficient sympathy from the House generally to secure either a Second Reading or a Government pledge to introduce legislation next Session -or at least to enable them to represent that the Government have once again impeded improvements for which there is wide sympathy by promises of legislation at an indefinite date..The present Bill does however propose great and far-reaching changes.      Its proposals fall under three heads.(l)   Compulsory insurance for employers against their liability to pay Compensation, extending to all employment covered by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.     This of course oovers an immense variety of employments both regular and casual including for example domestic service.      The Bill follows the lines of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Coal Mines) Act, 1934 which introduced the principle of compulsory insurance as regards coal mines; not only however was there a peculiar need for legislation for the coal mining industry, but such legislation was a oompara-tively simple matter because that industry is highly organized both on the employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s sides and the great bulk of the employers in it were members of Employers&apos; Mutual Indemnity Associations which readily took steps to extend and improve their insurance arrangements.     The question of their solvency was raised in the House,.and the Government representative, with the authority of the Board of Trade, promised consideration to the inclusion of such associations in an Assurance Companies Bill the introduction of which the Government had been contemplating for some time.There is much to be said for extending the application of compulsory insurance with a view to seouring so far as reasonably practicable that workmen are not deprived of their compensation owing to the insolvency of employers.     No doubt employers generally do in faot insure but sporadic oases of hardship due to insolvency of uninsured employers do occur from time to time and command much sympathy.     Moreover, the prinoiple of oompulsory insurance has now been recognized in other spheres,
1 Q Idsuch as motor traffic.      But the question of applying it to workmen&apos;s compensation insurance as respects employment generally, involves difficult problems which ought to be the subject of careful prepara-tory examination before legislation is undertaken.      For example there is the question of supervision or regulation of Mutual Indemnity Associations and Insurance Companies, as respects their solvenoy and perhaps also as regards such matters as the conditions which may be inserted in policies and the prevention of excessive charges. Compulsory Workmen&apos;s Compensation insurance would stimulate the formation of new Mutual Associations, but at present    such bodies are not subject to the general insurance provisions applicable to ordinary Insurance Companies under the Assurance Companies Act;    among other things they do not have to furnish accounts to the Board of Trade and further enquiry would be necessary to ascertain the financial position of existing Mutuals.     Again, a Board of Trade Committee on Compulsory Insuranoe has just made various recommendations, including proposals for licensing insurers on the advice of Advisory Committees, but it would be necessary to go into the question how far 1 these reoommenda-tions are applicable to Workmen&apos;s Compensation Insurance in employments outside the coal industry.Difficult problems also arise as regards the enforcement of insurance in unorganized employments.It can be urged therefore that legislation of the kind proposed in the Part II of the Bill is premature this Session, and that such legislation ought not to be tackled except after considerable further investigation.Benefits.      The Bill substantially follows certain provisions of the earlier Labour Party Bill on this subject.      The proposals are not only very generous to the workmen and their families;    they would also involve some fundamental changes in the principles on which the present Act is based.The main proposals are -(a) in fatal oases weekly pensions for widow and for children under 16 instead of (as at present) a lump sum (maximum  600) to be appqr-tioned among the dependants.      The widow would get at least o0/- a week whioh if she were aged 30 when the workman died would be worth about  1800.(b) For total inoapacity, full wages if wages were  3 a week \r less; if above that, a diminisnmg percentage but never less than 75% of wages.      For partial incapacity, the whole difference between pre-aooident and post-accident earnings.     At present the general rule is 60%,   (maximum compensation 30/-) grading up to 75% m the case of wages less than 25/-.(c) A radical change in the basis for calculating the compensation. The present basis is, broadly speaking, the actual average weekly earnings of,the particular workman under the particular employer. Under the Bill, the proposed basis is normal weekly earnings in a full normal week (whatever that may mean) or &quot;fair and equitable remuneration&quot;.      The legal and practical effect of the proposals is extremely obsoure. &quot; \The Government Actuary estimated in 1929 that the new scales of compeh-sation proposed in the Labour Party Bill would (apart from other \The Assuranoe Companies Bill mentioned above has not yet been passed.
influences such as (c) above) about double the cost of compensation; so that in the case for example of the mining industry alone, which paid about  2,900,000 in compensation in 1935, the cost would rise to something like  6,000,000.Again it may be   urged that the proposal to make the compensation so large as to provide the workman with 100$ of his old wages would remove a very strong incentive to the workman to get himself fit, whether for light work or for full work, and thus tend to prolong his incapacity.     Moreover, the fixing of 100$ means a radical change in the principle on which the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts are based, namely that employers and workmen should share the financial loss to the workman resulting from the accident.In this connexion I may say that there is now sitting a Committee on the Rehabilitation of Persons injured in Accidents, which is expected to report sometime next year and that it would seem premature to legislate on this subject in the meantime.     The Committee may make recommendations substantially affecting the financial liabilties of the employer.Some of the existing provisions as to benefits are certainly ripe for review and there is a good deal of feeling that they operate harshly (a) on highly paid workers who can only get 30/- a week compensation and (b) on workers earning comparatively little owing to depression in their industry;    but legislation on this difficult subject ought to be preceded by special inquiries.Medical Boards.     The Bill proposes to substitute a Medical Board of three for the single Medical Refereet     No doubt there is a strong feeling that a Board would command more confidence and that too much responsibility is at   present placed on a single Referee. In any case, however, the present proposal is premature.     The question cannot be properly considered without reference to the duties to be imposed on the Board or Referee as the case may be, and in fact a Departmental Committee is expected to report almost immediately not only as to the Medical Board proposal but as to the whole medical machinery under the Act, and it is not unlikely that their recommendations may be on different lines.Every part of this Bill raises controversial questions and if it obtains a Second Reading it may be expected to lead to prolonged discussions in Committee and to involve the Government representative in such an expenditure of time as would seriously prejudice the carrying out of that part of the Government programme for which the Home Secretary is mainly responsible.
15th November, 1937.Further, although the Bill as presented only deals with three subjects, its Title is very wide and the whole field of compensation would be open to discussion in Committee.There is however a strong case for reviewing many of the provisions of the present Act and a strong feeling in the House of Commons that this ought to be donee     I think we shall be confronted with a pressing demand for legislation in 1939, and, as my colleagues will be aware, a Workmen&apos;s Compensation Bill has already been included in the list of Bills for consideration as part of the Government programme for that year.     A number of Members in different parts of the House may feel that the provisions as to benefits might as well be thrashed out in Committee, that the principle of compulsory insurance might be accepted in advance of further legislative control of insurers, and that the Report of the Departmental Committee on the medical machinery would be available before the Committee Stage is finished.It may therefore be difficult or impossible to get a Second Reading rejected unless the Government give a promise of legislation next Session and I recommend that the Government representative in next Friday&apos;s Debate should be authorised to promise,  (but without committing himself to the precise lines of such legislation) that the Government will bring forward next Session legislation which would afford an opportunity for reviewing the various matters dealt with in the present Bill.If my colleagues approve, I would propose to arrange for conferences to take place at an early date between the Home Office and other Departments concerned, with a view to the preparation .of a Bill, which must in any case take a considerable time.S.H.
