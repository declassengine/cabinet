.3 * COPY NO.P.305(37)CABINET. Licensing of Advertisements (Scotland) Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.   Following upon its previous introduction in July last in the House of Lords, this Bill, which provides for a system of licensing of advertisements in Scotland, has &quot;been re-introduced by Lord Polwarth in the current session and will come up for Second Reading in the Lords at an early date.     The application of the Bill is limited to Scotland and I understand that it has the support of the Scottish County Councils&apos; Association and of the Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland.2.    The Bill pi-oposes that it shall be unlawful to erect, exhibit or maintain any advertisement except on such sites, buildings, hoardings or other places as may be licensed by the local authority.     From this restriction certain limited classes of advertisements are to be exempted, including -(a) advertisements inside buildings,(b) advertisements on premises relating to businesses carriedon therein,(c) advertisements on railway property not fronting public streets,(d) statutory advertisements, and(e) traffic signs on roads.Provision is also proposed to be made for an appeal to the sheriff against refusal of a licence by the local authority.3.    The existing position is briefly as follows:-(a) Under the Advertisements Regulation Acts of 1907 and 1925 local authorities generally are empowered to make bye-laws for the regulation of advertisements, but considerable difficulty has been experienced in Scotland in framing bye-laws which would not be open to challenge in the Scottish Courts.      In conformity with the advice given by successive Lord Advocates the Scottish Office have consistently refrained from confirming bye-laws which/
virtually repeat the general words of the Acts of 1907 and 1925 on the ground that aueh bye-laws are too vague.     Scottish County Councils, on the other hand, have a3 a rule declined to make byc-laws with the necessary degree of particularisation., including a schedule of the areas to be protected.(b) The erection or maintenance for advertising purposes of any hoarding exceeding twelve feet in height is unlawful under the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1905, without the consent of the Town Council.     This provision, however, applies only in burghs in which it has been specifically adopted by resolution of the Council.(c) Licensing provisions on the lines proposed in the Bill have been for a number of years in force in the cities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen under local legislation passed between 1899 and 1957.(d) An alternative method of control was provided by Section 40 of   theTown and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1932 in the case of areas where ascheme un&amp;sr that Act is in force;     That Section -(l) empowers the local authority to object to any advertisement which disfigures such amenities as may be selected for protections and, in the event of the person responsible refusing to remove it, to have the matter determined by the Sheriff, and(2) enables an advertiser) if he so wishes, to obtain the priorconsent of the local authority to the exhibition of advertisements of a particular class, and, in the event of permission being given, t^-isguards him from subsequently receiving a notice to remove it.Very few schemes, however, are yet in operation under the Town and Country Planning Acts and the progress of schemes under those Acts is complicated and slow.4.    It may be that unsightly advertisements are not more prevalent in Scotland than south of the Border, but there is a considerable body of opinion in favour of action to prevent further disfigurement of the country-side by such advertisements.     The need for such action is emphasised by the virtual breakdown of the bye-lav; method of control and by the importance of scenic attractions in Scotland.5, The proposal in the Bill to deal with the problem by a system of selective licensing which would give local authorities power to refuse or bo/
&apos;t;6 a.llow, subject to conditions, any advertisement proposed to be erected :&apos;n their area will, no doubt, be opposed by advertising and bill posting interests.      in a recent case a proposal by the Town Council of Airdrie to take power in a provisional Order to license advertisements was dropped as a result of such opposition.6.    On the other hand, similar licensing powers to those proposed in the Bill have been in operation In Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen for considerable periods and were accepted (subject to compromise with opponents) when the respective measures were promoted-     It may be difficult, in view of the existing precedents in local legislation, to object in principle to the extension of licensing powers to other burghs and to counties.7*    The discussion of the Bill in the House of Lords will enable the subject to be ventilated to some extent but, in view of the general disposition of that House to favour measures for the protection of amenity, criticism of the licensing provisions may not fully develop until it reaches the House of Commons.8.    I suggest, therefore, that during the Second Reading proceedings and the further stages of the Bill the Government&apos;s spokesman should maintain a non-committal, though not unfriendly, attitude;    and that, if the Bill gets a Second Reading in. the Lords, I should be authorised, without in any way committing the Government to support of the Bill, to consult with the Home Secretary and co-operate with the promoters in framing any amendments which appear to us to be necessary to ensure that, if it reaches the Statute Book, it does so in a workable form.9th December, 1937.
