(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1369-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.Part I. Introduction.IN accordance with the 301st Meeting* of the Committee of Imperial Defence we have had under consideration as a matter of urgency a despatch dated the 3rd November, 1937, and telegram dated the 12th November, 1937, from Sir Miles Lampson to the Foreign Office, a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to the Admiralty dated the 15th November, 1937, and a letter from the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt to the War Office dated the 28th October, 1937, dealing with the question of the defence of Egypt. The despatch and telegrams are attached to this Report as Appendices I-IV.2. The terms of reference remitted to us by the Committee of Imperial Defence are as follows : (i) Irrespective of the probability or otherwise of an Italian threat to Egypt in the near future, to consider and report on the precise measures which it would be possible to take to meet the demands summarised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 635 of the 13th November, irrespective-tive, in the first instance, of any question either of their reactions on our position vis-a-vis Germany, or of their being liable to be construed by the Italians as provocative, (ii) To indicate the effect which the adoption of each of the measures in question would have on our position vis-a-vis Germany.3. Before dealing in detail with the proposals put forward by the British Ambassador in Cairo, the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, and the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt for augmenting our strength in Egypt and the Middle East, we have certain preliminary observations of a general nature to make.[16196]   [16277]* Minute 3.b
4. It is clear that Sir Miles Lampson takes a serious view, which is also shared by the Egyptian authorities, of the possibility of Italian aggression against Egypt and the means at present available to defend that country against a sudden attack. While we do not wish to belittle the anxieties which we on our part feel regarding our general strength in the Middle East at the present time in the light of the strengthening of the Italian garrison in Libya and anti-British propaganda which has for some time been prevalent in the Middle East generally, we think that the Ambassadors apprehensions are, of necessity, based largely on the purely local outlook. In examining his proposals we have also to take into consideration our commitments in other parts of the world and the means at our disposal to meet them. Moreover, viewing the position from the Italian point of view, while Italy&apos;s local position in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean is at the moment relatively strong, her general strategic position remains inherently weak.5. We are informed that there is a tendency on the part of the Egyptian authorities to question the determination of His Majesty&apos;s Government to face the realities of the defence situation in Egypt and to carry out our obligations to assist, to the full measure of our ability, in the defence of that country against Italian aggression. We feel that it is important that this tendency should be checked as soon as possible, and that apart from any verbal reassurance which may be communicated to the Egyptian authorities, the best means of ensuring a continuation of their confidence in His Majesty&apos;s Governments competence to meet a threat from Italy would be by strengthening our military position in Egypt in no mistakable manner.6. Apart from this we have a moral responsibility for the defence of Egypt, a country which, to suit our own interests, we have kept virtually disarmed for the last 50 years. Moreover, there is an added danger that if we fail to retain the confidence of the Egyptian Government, the latter may become readily susceptible to Italian influences and this would greatly increase our difficulties.7. We now turn to the more detailed points raised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s despatch and telegram, and in the telegrams from the Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean, and the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt.Part II.- The Extent to which it would be possible to meet the Proposals put forward in appendices 1 to 4, irrespective of any other Considerations.Defence against Air Attach.8. We now turn to an examination of the specific proposals put forward in the Appendices to this Report with a view to determining the extent to which they can be met, irrespective of any other considerations.In paragraphs 11 and 12 of his despatch (Appendix II), Sir Miles Lampson draws attention to the psychological effect which modern warfare may have on the volatile and hysterical Egyptian population, and the possibility of panic with all its implications in the face of a heavy scale of Italian air attack, and in the absence of any anti-aircraft defence. We fully concur in the Ambassador&apos;s views on this point, and, as we show later, the immediate despatch of one anti-aircraft brigade and one anti-aircraft searchlight company (24 anti-aircraft guns and 24 searchlights) to Egypt would be possible under our present terms of reference and without regard to our commitments elsewhere. If it should be decided that the despatch of these guns and lights is unacceptable without some compensating measure for making good the deficiency from our total strength at home, consideration might be given to taking over temporarily from the Admiralty, and using for Home defence, certain 3-inch anti-aircraft guns allocated to merchant vessels. These guns are at present not provided with control arrangements, nor could they at present be employed in a mobile role. They are in fact of very low fighting value. The possibility of their use at home, will, however, be investigated.9. It was suggested at the last meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence* that, if we were unable to despatch modern anti-aircraft units to Egypt, it might be possible to send some old anti-aircraft guns and searchlights and to* C.I.D. 301st Meeting, Minute 3.
organise a force of Egyptians locally to man them. It might, therefore, be argued that the above naval anti-aircraft guns could be despatched to Egypt, as this would obviate the necessity for reducing the strength of our regular anti-aircraft formations at home. We are strongly opposed to this step, since the Egyptians are highly sensitive on the question of obsolescent equipment. Moreover, any improvisation required to render these equipments suitable for use on land could more easily be carried out in this country than in Egypt.10. The internal security question in Egypt in the event of war would, as Sir Miles Lampson points out, undoubtedly present a difficult problem. The existing garrison is insufficient to meet this commitment. There is a large British population in Cairo, and it would be necessary to keep in check the considerable Italian population which at present exists in Egypt (approximately 60,000). There are no British troops in Cairo under the existing defence plan, and there is only one British battalion at Alexandria, which constitutes the sole reserve available under the hand of the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt. It should be noted, however, that under the terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty we are no longer responsible in peace for the internal security of Egypt.Surprise Attack on Mersa Matruh.11. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of his despatch (Appendix II) Sir Miles Lampson refers to the probability of a sudden Italian attack developing against Mersa Matruh. We hope that we should receive some notice of an intention by the Italians to carry out prolonged operations in the Western Desert, as these would necessitate the building-up of considerable reserves of supplies of all kinds. Nevertheless, we agree that the existence of mobile forces in Libya enables the Italians to stage a sudden raid against Mersa^ Matruh. It is of the greatest importance for the defence of Egypt that Mersa Matruh should be held. We are, therefore, in agreement with the Ambassadors proposal that the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt should be given authority to move certain British units at his discretion to Mersa Matruh, but we suggest that this authority should only be exercised in case of emergency and not in normal times as suggested by the Ambassador.Air Raid Precautions.12. In paragraph 13 of his despatch (Appendix II) Sir Miles Lampson urges that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake the provision of gas masks for the whole British civilian community. Although this question is not strictly within our province, we recommend that since the stocks of gas masks for our own population in the United Kingdom are now nearing completion, consideration should be given to offering the Egyptian Government a certain number of gas masks on repayment for both the British and Egyptian civil population.Gun defences for the Suez Canal.13. We note that in paragraph 15 of the despatch (Appendix II) the Egyptian Prime Minister has raised the question of the defences of the Canal, and is anxious to provide coast defences at Port Said and Suez. While welcoming his intentions in this respect, we foresee the possibility that the installation of guns in peace time for the defence of the Canal might give rise to friction between the Egyptian and the Italian Governments, and lead to undesirable discussion as to the interpretation of the Suez Canal Convention. We therefore suggest that Nahas Pasha should be encouraged to prepare the concrete gun platforms at Suez and Port Said, and to store the necessary gun and searchlight equipments in the vicinity of those ports. It should then be possible to install the defences rapidly in the event of an emergency. We also consider that the question of the Canal defences can now be discussed freely with the Egyptian Prime Minister, since he has raised the question, without the need of disclosing the details of the Suez Canal Defence Plan.Formation of an Egyptian Navy.14.   In paragraph 16 of the despatch (Appendix II) a proposal is put forward that the Egyptian Government should be advised to form a Navy.   As a long-term project we see every advantage in this proposal, and suggest that [16196] b 2
the Admiralty should take up this question with a view to implementing it. The formation of a minesweeper force on the lines proposed would, however, take a considerable time, and we do not therefore regard it as one of the immediate measures which could be taken at the present time to improve our defensive position in Egypt.15. As regards moving four minesweepers to Alexandria, these could be used for training Egyptian crews, pending the arrival of Egyptian minesweepers, as Sir Miles Lampson suggests. Alternatively, as suggested in the Defence Plan, they could be laid up at Alexandria (or Haifa) with caretakers, where they would be more secure from air attack, while awaiting their crews than at Malta. At either Alexandria or Haifa they would be suitably placed initially for either a Mediterranean or a Far Eastern war. On the other hand, if they remain at Malta, their crews will arrive at an early date with the Malta reinforcements, whereas if in the Eastern Mediterranean, a considerably longer period may be required before the arrival of their crews, unless these can be supplied from fleet resources. On balance, however, it would probably be best to move these mine-sweepers to Alexandria, and to take early action with the Egyptian Government to commence training Egyptian crews in them. The Admiralty are taking this question up with the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.Establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus.16. The question of the establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus has been fully considered in other Papers, and, in our opinion, no useful purpose would be served in re-examining the project in the present connection (Appendix I, paragraph 3 (d) ). The establishment of an operational and repair base at Cyprus would take many years to complete, and, as we have already shown, would cost approximately  20,000,000. It would, moreover, present us with a heavy additional military commitment, and although we are fully aware of the need for additional docking facilities for the Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean, we suggest that no additional steps should be taken in this matter at present over and above the negotiations which are now in progress for the provision of docking facilities at Alexandria, which in any case will be required as a defended base for the Fleet (Appendix III, paragraph 7).Naval Measures.17. As an additional measure which would add to the readiness of the Fleet, H.M. ships Coventry and Curlew, which are specially fitted up as anti-aircraft cruisers with a heavy anti-aircraft armament, might be recommissioned. These vessels are at present not in full commission owing to lack of the necessary personnel to man them, and their recommissioning could at present only be effected by paying off some other ship or ships. This matter is under Admiralty consideration.A rmy Measures.18. In his letter to the War Office (Appendix IV, paragraphs 3 to 6), the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt expresses the opinion that with the present complete lack of A/A units and with the existing strengths and equipment now available, he cannot guarantee the security of Egypt against Italian aggression, unless reinforcements arrive within 14 days of the outbreak of hostilities. Recent examination of the problem of reinforcing Egypt after the outbreak of war has shown that the earliest date upon which the first reinforce-ments could arrive would be Z 4- 20- day for reinforcements from the United Kingdom, if routed through the Mediterranean, and Z -(- 24 days for reinforce-ments from India. The despatch of the former is dependent upon the situation at home, and of the latter upon the Government of India being able to spare them.19. The immediate measures proposed by Sir Miles Lampson to meet this situation in peace-time are contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of his telegram (Appendix I) and comprise&apos; the following : (i) Immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament to all units,especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles, (ii) Royal Engineer companies to be raised to war establishment with a 10 per cent, reserve.
(iii) All other units in Egypt to be raised to higher colonial establishment.(iv) Completion of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles, and theprovision of anti-gas equipment and a reserve M.T. company, (v) The provision of the following reinforcements : (a) One anti-aircraft brigade (most urgent).(b) One field company, Royal Engineers.(c) One armoured car unit.(d) One mixed tank battalion.(e) One infantry brigade, including one machine-gun battalion withthe necessary signal and ancillary services.The Ambassador further recommends that, with the exception of the anti-aircraft brigade, which should come to Egypt at all costs, the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine with orders that they should stand by to reinforce the garrison in Egypt at a momenfs notice. We deal with the above proposals seriatim in the paragraphs that follow.The immediate issue of tip-to-date equipment and armament to all units, especially Mark VI Tanks and anti-Tank Rifles.20. The question of the issue of Mark VI Tanks to Egypt is connected with the larger question of the despatch of a tank battalion (see paragraph 36 below).21. The Boyes Anti-Tank Rifle is now becoming available. Twenty are already being- despatched to Egypt, and the rest required can soon follow.As regards the 2-pdr, anti-tank gun, four are being sent to British troops in Egypt and another four to the Egyptian Government. There are 44 of these weapons available with units in the United Kingdom, and from now onwards there should be a monthly delivery of twelve guns. Accordingly, the total require-ments of 33 guns for the British troops in Egypt could be met early if their demand is given priority.22. The British garrison in Egypt can probably be issued with Bren guns in March and April, if they are given priority.23. The armoured cars of the 11th Hussars cannot at present be replaced by more up-to-date equipment.Royal Engineer Companies to be raised to War Establishment with 10 per cent. Reserve.24. This proposal involves considerable difficulty. If, in addition to implementing it, an extra Field Company, Royal Engineers (see paragraph 34 below), is sent out to Egypt, it will take most of the available resources in R.E. personnel outside the Intermediate Contingent, F.F., leaving several Field Companies in the United Kingdom at cadre strength.All other units in Egypt to be raised to Higher Colonial Establishment.25. The four Line Battalions now in Egypt are already nominally main-tained on Colonial Establishment, but they are not up to strength. They can be brought up to strength, but only at the expense of the battalions at Home. The two Guards Battalions at present in Egypt are at Home Establishment. One of them could be brought up to Colonial Establishment by drafts from Home, but the other, being a single battalion regiment (Irish Guards), could not be augmented.26. The Royal Horse Artillery in Egypt have 6 guns per battery at Colonial Establishment, but the Field Brigade, R.A., have four guns only in peace, the other two being kept in mobilisation stores in the country. It would be possible to bring this unit up to Colonial Establishment, but only at the expense of units at Home.27. The Cavalry in Egypt during 1938 will be 250 under strength. This shortage could be made good only at the expense of units at Home.28. The Royal Corps of Signals in Egypt are already up to Colonial Estab-lishment, except for three sections which are non-existent. These could be pro-vided, but only at the expense of units at Home.
Completion of Reserves of Guns, Armaments and Vehicles and the provision of Anti-Gas Equipment and a reserve M.T. Co. 29.   Requirements in anti-gas equipment, both personal and unit, of the Garrison in Egypt, are in process of fulfilment, and the final consignment will reach Egypt before the end of this year.30. As regards the remaining items of equipment, a great deal of detail is involved. The matter is under consideration by the War Office, and the question of whether Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s proposals can be met depends not only on the order of priority which is granted to Egypt but also on the dates of delivery.Reinforcements.31. We will now consider seriatim the question of the despatch to Egypt of the reinforcements requested by Sir Miles Lampson.32. One anti-aircraft brigade could be sent to Egypt from this country. This would include the necessary complement of specialists, but some of the remaining personnel would have to be made up from Field Artillery units and would require training. It is estimated that this training would take about two months.33. Although no request has been made for searchlights, their provision is essential for effective AA. gun defence and for co-operation with fighters at night. One company of AA. searchlight R.E. (24 lights) could be sent to Egypt. The equipment is available, but, owing to the shortage of R.E. personnel, the only source from which the company could be brought up to strength would be from the regular searchlight battalion at Home. This would bring this unit to a very low state of efficiency.34. One Field Company, Royal Engineers, and one Armoured Car regiment can be sent to Egypt from this country.35. It is impossible to comply with the request for a mixed tank battalion since the medium tanks at present in this country are obsolete. A light tank battalion could, however, be sent.36. The present situation as regards tanks in Egypt is that, in the battalion of the Royal Tank Corps and the 7th Hussars, there is a total of 19 obsolete medium and 73 light tanks; six of the latter being, loaned to the Egyptian Government.If the Light Tank Battalion was despatched from the United Kingdom, it would have.45 Mark VI tanks, bringing the total of the light tanks in Egypt up to 118. Arrangements have already been made to send out to the 7th Hussars 14 Mark VI tanks to replace unserviceable Mark II tanks. If both these moves are completed, there would be 79 Mark VI light tanks out of the total of 118 in Egypt; the remainder required for replacement of earlier Marks in the 7th Hussars will not be available under the present programme before April 1938.The 8th Hussars are equipped with unarmoured vehicles; they will eventually have light tanks, but it will not be possible to provide these until the 7th Hussars are complete.37. One Infantry Brigade, including one Machine Gun Battalion, with the necessary signal and ancillary services could be provided.38. We would emphasise, however, that this brigade could not be brought up to serviceable strength without calling up the Class A Reserve.39. Sir Miles Lampson has recommended that, with the exception of the A.A. Brigade, all the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine, where the accommodation&quot; question is already a difficult one. We oppose this recommendation. Inasmuch as these forces are intended for the defence of Egypt, they should be stationed in that country, and suitable accommodation should be provided for them.Air Force Measures.40. In paragraph 6 of his telegram (Appendix I) the British Ambassador asks that the air forces of Egypt should be reinforced by two Bomber squadrons and one Fighter Squadron, and that the re-equipment of all existing Squadrons in Egypt with new types of aircraft should be accelerated.
41. We would point out that steps are already being taken to improve our air situation in the Middle East. The re-equipment of one Squadron in Egypt and one in Iraq is now under way and the last of the aircraft for these Squadrons will be shipped by the first week- in December. The existing programme also pro-vides for the re-equipment of the Bomber Squadron in East Africa in March 1938. In addition, it has been decided to re-equip one Bomber Squadron (No. 33) now in Egypt as a Fighter Squadron with up-to-date aircraft capable of dealing with the best Italian bombers, and it is hoped that this will be completed in the ordinary course by the Spring of 1938.42. It would, however, be possible, in addition, to despatch the one Fighter and two medium bomber squadrons considered necessary by Sir Miles Lampson, but the re-equipment with fighters of the Bomber Squadron referred to above could be expedited if this were acceptable as an alternative to sending a Fighter Squadron from the United Kingdom. The re-equipment of the two remaining Bomber Squadrons in Egypt over and above the Squadrons already due for re-equipment could also be carried out during the coming winter.43. On the other hand, it would not be possible to carry out the whole programme immediately. A limiting factor is the possibility of packing the necessary aircraft. The packing depot is already working to capacity within its present establishment, and it is unlikely that it would be practicable to pack the aircraft required (a) for the three additional Squadrons proposed by the Ambassador,(b) for the programme already projected for Egypt, Iraq and Kenya, and(c) for the re-equipment of the Squadrons in Egypt over and above that programme,before some time in March 1938. Even this rate of packing only allows for the initial provision of a low scale of reserves, and the remaining aircraft to make up the necessary reserves could not be despatched before the Spring or early Summer.Summary.44. We summarize below, for convenience of reference, the steps which it would be possible to take to meet the requests put forward in Appendices I-IV, irrespective of any other considerations whatsoever.Army Measures.45. (i) Egypt jould be given priority of issue of up-to-date equipment and armament to all units, especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles.(ii) Royal Engineer companies could be raised to war establishment with a 10 per cent, reserve.(iii) All other units in Egypt except one Battalion of Guards could be raised to higher colonial establishment.(iv) The provision of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles, and theprovision of anti-gas equipment and a reserve M.T. Company depends upon deliveries and the priority assigned to Egypt in these respects.(v) The following reinforcements could be provided : (a) One A/A Brigade (24 3-inch A/A  guns)  and one A/ASearchlight Company (24 Searchlights).(b) One field company, Royal Engineers.(c) One armoured car unit.(d) One light tank battalion (but not a mixed tank battalion as requested).(e) One infantry brigade, including one machine gun battalion withthe necessary signal and ancillary services.(vi) We see no objection to the delegation of authority to the General OfficerCommanding British Troops in Egypt to move certain British Troops to Mersa Matruh at his discretion in case of emergency.
Air Forces.(vii) The re-equipment of three bomber squadrons in Egypt, Kenya and Iraq with modern types is already approved and will be effected this winter. In addition, it is hoped to re-equip one bomber squadron in Egypt as a fighter squadron by the Spring of 1938.(viii) The re-equipment of the remaining bomber squadron in Egypt could also be done this Winter, (ix) In addition, one fighter and two medium bomber squadrons could be despatched from United Kingdom to Egypt by March 1938.General Measures.Defence of the Canal.(x) So as to ensure that coast defence can be installed as rapidly as possible for the defence of the Suez Canal in an emergency, we suggest that Nahas Pasha should be invited to consider the preparation of concrete gun platforms at Port Said and Suez, and the storage of the necessary coast defence guns and search-lights in the vicinity of these ports in peace-time.Commissioning of A /A Cruisers Coventry and Curlew.(xi) The Admiralty had under consideration the commissioning of two A/A cruisers Coventry and Curlew. This could only be effected, however, by paying off some other ship or ships.Provision of Gas Masks in Egypt.(xii) We suggest that consideration should be given to offering the Egyptian Government a certain number of gas marks on repayment for issue both to the British and Egyptian civil population.Formation of an Egyptian Navy.(xiii) We see every advantage as a long-term project in the proposal for theformation of a mine-sweeping unit manned by Egyptian personnel. This could not take effect for some considerable time, and cannot, therefore, be regarded as an immediate measure. In the meantime four British minesweepers might be stationed at Alexandria for training Egyptian personnel.Establishment of a Naval Base at Cyprus.(xiv) The question of the establishment of a Naval base at Cyprus has beenfully considered in other Papers, and we do not consider that any useful purpose would be served in re-examining the project in the present connection.Part III. The Effect of the Measures indicated in Part II above on our Position &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; Germany.46. In the preceding Part we have, in accordance with the first portion of our terms of reference, indicated the steps which it would be physically possible for us to take to strengthen our position in PCgypt. We now turn to an examination of the second portion of our terms of reference, namely, the effect which the adoption of these measures would have on our position vis-a-vis Germany.Army measures.-47. The despatch of the A.A. Brigade, R.A., and the Company of search-lights would weaken the air defence of this country, and, if guns were sent out, ammunition would also have to be provided. The despatch of one A.A. brigade would represent a decrease of one-ninth of the mobilizable A.A. guns in the United Kingdom. The despatch of A.A. ammunition, on the scale at present held for A.A. defence at home, would considerably deplete stocks in this country.
The armoured car regiment and the light tank battalion are a part of the intermediate contingent of the Field Force, but other reinforcements could be provided without denuding this contingent.   &apos;The provision of personnel to bring units to Colonial Establishment would in varying degrees interfere with the training of units in the United Kingdom in 1938. Supplies of Bren guns, anti-tank rifle and guns will be available in numbers early next year.Air Force measures.48. If we were to adopt the full programme indicated in paragraphs 41-43 above, its effect upon our position vis-a-vis Germany would be considerable. In its present state of expansion the strength of the air force at home is very seriously below that which we consider necessary to meet the threat of German air attack, and the despatch of the reinforcements demanded would still further accentuate this weakness.49. The detailed effect of the full programme upon our position vis-a-vis Germany would be as follows : (i) If the re-equipment of No. 33 Squadron referred to in paragraph 41 above is to be expedited, this would only mean reducing our already exiguous reserves of Gladiators by four aircraft, provided that this measure could be given priority over the supply of 15 Gladiators to Portugal.(ii) The re-equipment of the bomber squadrons in Egypt and Kenya (otherthan No. 33) can be done without affecting our metropolitan programme.(iii) If it is decided, in addition, to send out another Fighter Squadron, thiswould mean rolling up a second Gladiator Squadron at home to provide the necessary reserves, i.e., a total loss of 2 out of 8 Fighter Squadrons at home at present re-equipped with moderately up-to-date aircraft.(iv) The despatch of the 2 additional Bomber Squadrons would involve rollingup one additional Bomber Squadron at home, i.e., a total loss of 3 out of 4 of the 14 Bomber Squadrons at present equipped with up-to-date aircraft.(v) In summary, to meet Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s requirements, we should haveto reduce our Metropolitan Air Force by 3 medium Bomber and 2 Fighter Squadrons at the present time. Of these, however, the one Bomber and one Fighter Squadron used to provide Aircraft reserves could be re-equipped after a period of about 8 weeks, at the cost of a corresponding delay in the completion of our Home Defence re-equipment programme as a whole.Part IV. Concluding Observations and Recommendations.50. In the preceding Parts of this report we have confined ourselves to the questions specifically referred to us in the terms of reference quoted in para-graph 2. We feel, however, that it is our duty to invite attention to certain considerations of a military character which lie somewhat outside our terms of reference, and to submit, in the light of these considerations, our recommendations as to the immediate military measures that should be taken to strengthen our position in Egypt.51. We have recently examined the problem of reinforcing our garrisons in the Mediterranean, Middle East and North-East Africa in the event of a unilateral war against Italy. The problem is a complex one, and presents many difficulties. These difficulties would be very greatly enhanced in the event of a multilateral war. If some or all of the measures set out in Part II were adopted, our military position in Egypt would be considerably strengthened in peace-time, and the reinforcement problem in the event of war against Italy would bv proportionately simplified.[16196] c
52. On the other hand, there are a number of other considerations to be borne in mind. In the first place we desire to recall that scarcely a year has elapsed since the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, under the provisions of which our military garrison in Egypt is limited to 10,000 men, except in the event of emergency, or apprehended emergency. The Garrison in Egypt is already slightly over 10,000 men; and it is therefore clear that the despatch of the reinforcements mentioned in Part II would raise it to a figure considerably in excess of the authorised maximum. There was general agreement at the last meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence that there was little risk of an immediate threat to Egypt. The implication, therefore, is that the reinforcements now proposed by Sir Miles Lampson should be a permanent addition to the Garrison of Egypt. We think that this point should be carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government in reaching their decision as to the character and extent of the reinforcements which should be provided.53. In this connection we desire also to invite attention to the discontent that is inevitably connected with extra foreign service on a temporary basis with its attendant financial loss to the individual. The Army has already been compelled to increase its temporary Garrisons, both in the Far East and in Palestine, and the assumption of yet a third liability of this nature can only tend to militate against recruiting.54. If there were any immediate threat to Egypt, we would recommend that, from the military point of view, all the measures indicated in Part II of this report should be taken forthwith, provided, of course, that our relations with Germany permitted. In view of the fact, however, that no such immediate threat is apprehended, and that the primary purpose of strengthening our position in Egypt is to reassure Egyptian public opinion, we suggest that, from the military point of view, the following measures should suffice : Army Measures.55. (i) The despatch of one A.A. Brigade (24 3-inch A.A. Guns); and one AA. Searchlight Company (24 Searchlights) (paragraph 45 (v) (a)).Note. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thinks it advisable to accept the disadvantages of this measure from the Army point of view. The Chief of the Air Staff on the other hand, from the point of view of the responsibilities of the Air Ministry for the defence of Great Britain against air attack, is disinclined to give priority to Egypt in this matter.(ii) The despatch of one light Tank Battalion (paragraph 45 (v) id)).(iii) Priority of issue to the British troops in Egypt of up-to-dateequipment and armaments, especially anti-gas and anti-tank (paragraph 45 (i)).(iv) Delegation of authority to the General Officer Commanding BritishTroops in Egypt to move certain British Troops to Mersa Matruh at his discretion in case of emergency (paragraph 45 (vi)).Air Force Measures.(v) The re-equipment of No. 45 Squadron in Egypt and No. 30 Squadron in Iraq with modern bombers, now in hand, will be completed as soon as possible.

APPENDIX I.Copy of a Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (No. 635) dated November 12, 1937.MY despatch No. 1257 of 3rd November (by bag 6th November) contained detailed comment on combined defence scheme prepared by heads of services. It emphasised that recommendations in scheme were to be regarded as minima. It was written only three days after my return to Egypt, and I have since become aware that recommendations were minima in a different sense from that which I had at first supposed, i.e., they were based not so much on what heads of services believed was necessary for defence of Egypt, if that problem were considered by itself, but what was believed to be feasible in the light of preoccupations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in other regions. I conceive it my duty, however, to submit my views solely from Egyptian angle, leaving it to His Majesty&apos;s Government to judge comparative merits of requirements here and elsewhere.2. It is unnecessary for me to dwell on strategic importance of Egypt to ourselves. But apart from this, there is one primary and outstanding considera-tion which I must emphasise with all the force at my command, namely, the complete confidence still placed although it is diminishing in unofficial circles  in our ability to implement our treaty obligation to defend Egypt. It is of the first importance that neither Egyptian Government nor the people should have cause to doubt this.3. Before getting down to details there are four other general considera-tions : (a) Since Abyssinian campaign, the balance of force in the Near East from a military point of view has been completely reversed by arrival of Italian reinforcements in Libya and their proved ability to reinforce on a large scale at short notice both their land and air force; while difficulties in reinforcing Egypt after hostilities have commenced have greatly increased.(&amp;) If I understand the position correctly, it would be most imprudent to bank on requisite supplies of material and personnel reaching Egypt intact through Mediterranean during early stages of hostilities. But to this recognised danger must now be added the danger to transit through the Red Sea. If our secret information just received is correct, approach to Red Sea through Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb is already complicated by presence of Italian guns. Our reports indicate that batteries have been installed on Island of Dumeira, where channel is barely 10 miles wide (see correspondence ending with your despatch No. 593). Naval liaison officer is of opinion that Red Sea itself could be kept open as to surface craft by having at least one light cruiser permanently in Red Sea plus East Indies Squadron based on Aden, but that coastal batteries and air attack would still constitute serious menace. I submit this is a highly important aspect that should be considered at once; apart from other effects, it might hamper arrival of reinforcements from India.(c) A prudent estimate must allow, in the light of events in Palestine, forveiled hostility, if not more (especially if things appear to be going badly) from population of neighbouring Arab States. This, inter alia, would complicate alternative of overland transit from Basrah. Further, the existing garrison of Palestine might well need1 reinforce-ment in above event.-(d) Absence of an adequate and secure naval base in Eastern Mediterranean.Egyptian co-operation in construction of proposed dock at Alexandria is probable as things stand at present, but surely it would be unwise to place complete reliance in time of war upon necessary land facilities, including labour supply. I would quote paragraph 12 of your despatch - No. 761 of 29th June to the effect that while it is still a grave objection that &quot;the only base in Eastern Mediterranean should be in the hands of a fickle oriental Power, it must be remembered that
considerable British forces will, if an emergency arises, be available to protect our base at Alexandria from any possible Egyptian acts of sabotage.&quot; But this is definitely not so. Heads of services report shows only British troops available for Alexandria would be one battalion constituting General Officer Commanding&apos;s only reserve, which might have to be utilised elsewhere according to situation. I can, therefore, in no sense guarantee that a situation might not arise rendering proposed Alexandria dock (apart from absence of proper local defence) useless or unsafe. And at the best, the absence of repair shops, &amp;c, would surely reduce its value? I am aware that it may hardly be within my sphere, but T cannot avoid opinion that it would be far wiser and safer to revert to Cyprus project and not be dependent in so vital a matter upon the goodwill of any foreign country, whether allied or otherwise.4. As a result of full discussion with General Officer Commanding and Air Officer Commanding in the light of above considerations, I submit absolute minima to which, in our opinion, effect should immediately be given if we are to be in a position to ensure the safety of Egypt: Land. (a) Immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament for all units as already asked for, especially Mark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles. (General Officer Commanding tells me he has none of the latter at all, though ten are being issued to Egyptian army). Royal Engineer companies to be raised to war establishment with a 10 per cent, reserve; all other units now in Egypt to colonial establishment. Completion of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles and provision of anti-gas equipment and reserve M.T. Company.(b) Reinforcements as follows : One anti-aircraft brigade (most urgent). One field company R.E. One armoured car unit. One mixed tank battalion.One  infantry  brigade including one  machine-gun  battalion,  with necessary signal and ancillary services.5. To be 100 per cent, safe, these troops should form part of garrison of Egypt and despite considerable increase in numbers they involve, we might be able to get present Government to accept their presence without invoking &quot; appre-apprehended international emergency &quot; clause of treaty or arguments furnished in your telegram No. 514 of 9th November. But, as you know, political situation is at present uncertain, another Government might be less accommodating; moreover, there is always possibility of the Opposition making political capital. I there-fore recommend that, with the exception of anti-aircraft brigade, which should come to Egypt at all costs, the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine, with orders that they should stand by to come to Egypt at a moments call. ,6. Air. In addition to one fighter squadron for defence of Alexandria already asked for in heads of services report, R.A.F. to be at once reinforced by two bomber squadrons equipped with latest long-distance bombers. Replacement of aircraft of squadrons already here by up-to-date aircraft to be seriously accelerated. Air Officer Commanding informs me that these requirements are the more urgent in view of secret information, just received from a reliable source, of reinforcement of Italian Air Force in Libya by twenty aircraft, believed to be S 81, to form two new bomber groups at a new aerodrome just completed at Tobruk.7. Our discussion has definitely confirmed my anxiety of a successful surprise attack on Mersa Matruh owing to lack of sufficiently early information to ensure prior occupation by British troops. We propose trying to meet this by arranging forthwith with Egyptian Government for strengthening of light-car (frontier administration) patrols on frontier and for installation in western desert of air observation posts the same as in 1935, to be manned at once when judged necessary Ideal would clearly be to station a strong British garrison in Mersa Matruh. International as well as Egyptian internal politics may well be against this at the moment, but I would once more most strongly ui&apos;ge that General Officer Commanding be given forthwith unfettered discretion to move British units to
Mersa Matruh whenever he judges it necessary. Otherwise, I submit we are running an unwarrantable risk of being caught napping (please see paragraph ft of my despatch No. 1257).8. There is also possibility of a successful Italian attack on Sudan. Apart from the politico-moral effect both in Egypt and elsewhere, I should have thought such an attack would affect the defence of Egypt both as regards possible air attacks from south and occupation of Port Sudan, with its consequent menace to communication in the Red Sea. It is true that I am advised that occupation of Khartum, Atbara and Port Sudan from Eritrea presents great military difficulties; none the less, I submit necessity of reinforcing Sudan from India through East Africa or Port Sudan upon outbreak of hostilities should at least be studied.9. Foregoing (with exception of paragraph 8) represents the minimum requirements to ensure defence of Egypt, and it is of profound importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have in mind that inability to meet them may well entail grave risk in the Near East and inability to discharge obligations assumed under our alliance towards Egypt. If considerations elsewhere are held to override our Egyptian responsibilities, position is obviously very serious; nor do I see how we can counter the growing feeling restated in Parliament this week by Ismail Sidki Pasha, in favour of an Egyptian treaty of reinsurance with Italy.Please read this telegram in conjunction with my despatch No. 1257, which covers a number of other important points, especially the risk of a breakdown of governmental and civilian morale, with all its implications, if our present inadequate resources are not strengthened.10. Beginning of telegram has been seen and concurred in by General Officer Commanding and Air Officer Commanding.(Repeated to Commander-in-chief, Mediterranean.)APPENDIX II.Copy of a Despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 1257, dated November 3, 1937.Sir,I HAVE only been back at my post three days, but I have endeavoured,, during that short time, to clear my mind on the Combined Plan for the defence of Egypt prepared by the three Heads of Services, copies of which were forwarded to you under cover of Mr. Kelly&apos;s most secret despatch No. 1236 of 30th October. Before forwarding my comments thereon, as instructed in your despatch No. 760 of the 30th June, I should like to pay a tribute to Admiral Pound, General Weir and Air Vice-Marshal Maclean and the members of their staffs for the prepara-tion of this most valuable and comprehensive scheme in the course of only eight days.2. When studying the plan, it must, in the first place, be borne in mind that in many respects it is essentially a short-time scheme which will probably require alteration when improvements are eventually made in the equipment of the Egyptian forces, the organisation of their reserves, and the training of territorial forces which, apart from the creation of a mobile striking force based on Mersa Matruh, will release a far higher number of comparatively efficient Egyptian troops for the defence of the Western Desert than is provided for in the present plan.3. I would like first to draw attention to certain features in the recom-mendations of the three Heads of Services which seem to establish that they should be regarded as representing our minimum and not our maximum requirements.4. For example, no less than four admitted possibilities (raids from ships on vulnerable points on lines of communications, a raid on the Suez Oil Refinery, a raid on the north .coast between Alexandria and Mersa Matruh, and the shortening of the thirty-six hours period of notice for an attack on Mersa Matruh) are all listed as improbable.
5. Of these, the first three are technical matters which I am hardly qualified to judge; and on the fourth, I submit my observations with some diffidence, as it must be primarily a matter for military appreciation. The issue is, however, so serious and may, indeed, be so vital, that I venture to put forward one aspect of the matter which at once suggests itself to the lay mind.6. It may be that the Italians would launch their attack en masse as contemplated in paragraph 5 of Part I of the Plan, and that the situation would develop in such as way as to give adequate time for the proposed counter measures to be taken during the precautionary period. But surely if the Italians realise, as they must, the vital importance of Mersa Matruh, they will use every effort to take it by surprise ? The increase of mechanised forces in Libya capable of moving across the open desert and not confined to roads must, I submit, substantially increase the possibility of such surprise. Is it safe to assume that information of an unusual concentration on the other side of the frontier would, in a vital emergency, necessarily be received in time to enable a British mobile force to reach Matruh first or even to arrive before the Italians had had time to consolidate ? I should have thought not : and, if I am right, this is surely a vitally material consideration. It might even be that Mersa Matruh could be rushed and seized by a small highly mobile force in advance of the main body, and that this stroke might be the first warning of the opening of hostilities. This possibility seems to deserve the most careful consideration. It is true that the position is now being improved to some extent by the transfer to Mersa Matruh of an Egyptian battalion for the purpose of putting the existing defences into a state of repair and by the withdrawal to Mersa Matruh of the Egyptian battery of 3-7 Howitzers from Sollum. But, even when this battalion has been equipped with modern weapons, it would be tempting Providence to rely on Egyptian troops standing up to even a minor attack unless stiffened by the presence of British troops or at least British officers. It should also be borne in mind that, as I understand the position, the existing defences of Mersa Matruh were sited on the basis of the maximum number of troops which were available at the time when the defences were laid out in 1935. If the danger I have fore-seen above in fact exists, it follows that it may and probably does involve revised arrangements for the permanent occupation of Mersa Matruh and for better observation in the Western Desert than there is at present. In this connexion I can only urge with all the emphasis at my command that further consideration be given to the General Officer Cpmmanding&apos;s request for authority to move British units at his discretion to Mersa Matruh in normal times. This seems an elementary and most obvious precaution.7. There is another point. The plan relies in the main on the Alexandria-Mersa Matruh railway as the line of communication after the attack has developed. But there is the danger, certainly not in the least imaginary, of sabotage on a line running from Alexandria, to say nothing of possible air attack. The plan thus places a heavy responsibility on the Egyptian troops who are to be responsible for the maintenance of communications and internal order through-out Egypt. I am not clear from the Report whether this special danger has been adequately considered and provided against.8. The position as regards communications with Mersa Matruh will be improved by the completion of the Alexandria-Fuka road, which is one of the recommendations of the Heads of Services and on which Nahas Pasha has already undertaken that work should be proceeded with at once. I have ascertained privately, however, that this will normally take one year to complete, and that, even with a special effort, the road could not at the best be ready before six months. Further, the Report provides that it will be necessary to rely on requisitioned lorries and local drivers to form any road link between Alexandria and Mersa Matruh. It would seem well that civilian lorries and drivers should be earmarked ahead for this purpose.9. One of the most important requirements of the Royal Air Force to enable them to operate from Mersa Matruh and other landing grounds in the Western Desert is that adequate supplies of fuel and bombs should be made available there for immediate use. A recommendation to this effect was recently put forward by the three Heads of Services as a measure of immediate necessity, but I learn that His Majesty&apos;s Government decided against this for the moment. It is surely mere common sense that effect should be given to this recommendation,
1(3which will now be considerably facilitated by the presence of Egyptian forces at Mersa Matruh which will enable supplies of fuel and bombs to be moved up to that area and stored away without causing undue attention. It appears to me in the nature of an elementally routine precaution, and I can see no reason or adequate justification for deferring it until the actual need arises. Again there is the vital question of the improvement of the water supply at Mersa Matruh, and here I would urge that effect should be given at once to the recommendations in paragraph 5 of Appendix 4 of the Plan that four portable distillation units should be sent out forthwith.10. The second main impression which I have derived from the Report is the truly alarming extent to which reliance has to be placed upon the arrival of essential equipment and personnel after the conflict has begun. The Report, it will be observed, refers to the most alarming inferiority of our air forces during the first few weeks or even months, and even shows that the short ranges of our present bomber types now in Egypt limit the attacks on the present Italian aerodromes to those situated relatively near the frontier. Further, while it shows up clearly the startling superiority of the Italian air forces in respect of both numbers and bombing range, enabling them to raid both Cairo and Alexandria, it emphasises the complete absence of anti-aircraft defence in Egypt. The importance of this relevation can hardly be exaggerated : and whilst I realise the difficulties of remedying the deficiencies, I cannot refrain from urging with insistence that every effort be made to do so. Again, the inadequacy of the land forces is laid bare, even if it be less striking. Yet, the arrival of one very fast (&quot; Furious &quot;) convoy carrying aircraft, an anti-aircraft brigade and armoured-car fighting vehicles must be awaited for twelve days after &quot; Zero,&quot; and, unless further essential requirements (including an infantry brigade) can come from Palestine, they must be brought in one or two fast convoys through the Mediterranean. All this, together with a convoy from India, is postulated in addition to an anti-aircraft brigade and one fighter squadron, which do not exist in Egypt to-day, but which the Report recommends should be sent out from the United Kingdom forthwith. The scheme thus seems to the lay mind to involve several grave risks : (a) the risk of part of the convoys never getting here at all; (b) the certainty of Egypt being left with inadequate defences for from twelve days to a month; (c) the diversion of the Navy to escort duties as its primary task during the critical period immediately after the opening of hostilities.11. I feel it my duty also to draw attention to the psychological effect of modern warfare on the volatile and hysterical Egyptian population, particularly in the big cities, including the members of the Government themselves and senior Egyptian officials. The knowledge that, with no anti-aircraft defence, they were being exposed to a series of bombing attacks, possibly combined with the use of gas, might easily lead to disorders, and even a complete breakdown of the machinery of Government. But the plan relies solely on the Egyptian troops for internal security and anti-sabotage purposes. It rightly draws attention to the necessity of a small British garrison being available for Cairo and Alexandria, but points out that, with the forces available, it would not be possible to have any such garrison in Cairo until reinforcements arrived. In the past experience has shown the immense moral effect of the presence of Englishmen in stiffening the Egyptian army and police. The report places Alexandria first and Cairo fifth in the likely order of priority of air objectives, but if the seat of Government were in Cairo at the time, the demoralisation and disorganisation of the centre of Government would rank high as a military objective for the enemy.12. All the foregoing considerations point to one general conclusion which I would urge as of fundamental importance. I consider it is not merely the ideal solution, but a matter of vital necessity, that the garrison of Egypt should be made to the utmost possible extent self-sufficient before the outbreak of hostilities. The recommendations are based upon the assumption that the supplies and reinforcements which will be admittedly necessary can be accumulated in England and sent by convoy after the outbreak of hostilities, although much of what is required is already available. I cannot too emphatically dissent from this policy which I regard as involving a wholly unjustifiable risk of local disaster.13. In accordance with the recommendations in paragraph 45 of Part 3, Section I of the Plan, steps are already being taken to urge the Egyptian Govern-ment to bring the existing Air Raids Precautions Scheme up to date and to establish an organisation for implementing it and to provide the requisite stores.
Under the existing Egyptian Air Raids Precautions Scheme no provision has, however, been made for supplying the whole civilian community (even in the big cities) with gas masks, and I strongly urge that in the special circumstances in which Egypt is situated, His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake the provision of gas masks for the whole British civilian community. As far as the Italian menace is concerned, the British families in Egypt will obviously be in much greater danger than the civilian population in England.14. I also recommend that one of the subjects to be discussed with the Egyptian authorities should be the supply of reserve medical stores for the civilian population of Egypt for use in the event of war, as I presume that after the outbreak of hostilities these would be unobtainable, at any rate for a considerable time.15. It will be seen that the Heads of Services suggest, in paragraph 6 of Appendix 6, that, contrary to the views expressed in your telegram No. 503 of the 3rd November, the coastal defence guns and searchlights for eventual use in the defence of the Suez Canal, should be stored in the Canal Zone and not at Alexandria, which, in addition to being a long way off, will also be the centre of particularly heavy rail traffic. In the event of this recommendation which I endorse being accepted, I see no special need to inform the Egyptians of the existence of the guns, searchlights, &amp;c, at all. If, however, it is considered essential that they should be informed of their presence, it would be far better to explain their real purpose rather that to describe them as spares for use in Alexandria or Mersa Matruh. In this connexion, I understand that, during his conversation with the General Officer Commanding on the 25th October, the Prime Minister raised the question of the defences of the Canal. On General Weir observing that the Suez Canal Convention prevented the erection of any coast defences at Port Said or Suez, Nahas Pasha exclaimed that Egypt, being a free country, was certainly entitled to defend her coasts if she thought fit. Nahas Pasha may well return to this point.16. In paragraph 8 of Part 4 of the Plan, it is suggested that the Egyptian Government should be advised to form a navy, consisting, in the first instance, of six mine-sweepers, and, in the following paragraph it is suggested that they should be asked to agree to the laying up at Alexandria of four mine-sweepers, with caretakers on board, to be manned by British crews from Malta in the event of an emergency. It has been suggested to me that, pending the arrival of the Egyptian mine-sweepers, it would be far better to offer the Egyptian Government the use of the four British mine-sweepers for the purpose of training Egyptian crews possibly under a naval branch of the Military Mission. This certainly seems worth consideration.17. No reference is made in the Defence Scheme to the question of the declaration of martial law by the Egyptian Government, which raises such complicated issues as the powers to be delegated to the British General Officer Commanding, the composition and powers of military courts, &amp;c. This matter was raised in paragraphs 3 and 4 of my secret despatch No. 297 of the 9th March in connexion with the revision of the Suez Canal Defence Scheme, and I have not yet received the views of the competent authorities of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment thereon. I suggest that the scheme, as eventually presented to Nahas Pasha should contain our proposals for dealing with this matter.18. The Scheme contains no provision for dealing with the question of requisitioning private property, &amp;c, which, in the 1935-36 crisis, was found to present certain difficulties under the existing Egyptian Law.19. Part IV of the Scheme contains a list of the subjects in regard to which the active co-operation of the Egyptian Government will be required. In addition, there appear to be a number of other minor points in which action by the Egyptian authorities will also be necessary, and which I suggest might be conveniently added to the existing list in paragraph IV : Part III (i), paragraph 58.(1) The establishment of a depot containing fourteen days&apos; army stores at Mersa Matruh, including petrol and a quota of anti-tank guns and ammunition, and the training of the Egyptian battalion in their use.[&quot;16196] D
Part III (i), paragraph 60.(2) The construction and stocking of main dumps at Mersa Matruh for the storage of petrol, oil and bombs for use by the Royal Air Force. (If approved, see paragraph 9 above.)Part III (ii), paragraphs 80 and 81.(3) The establishment of air observation posts in the Western Desert and out to sea during the precautionary period (or preferably forthwith).Appendix 1 B, paragraph 12 (a) and (b).(4) The provision of extra pontoons at Mersa Matruh. (N.B. The Head of the Military Mission has already urged upon the Minister of War the improvement of port facilities at Mersa Matruh.)Appendix 9, paragraph 2.(5) The appointment of an Egyptian liaison officer to the Naval Fortress Commander at Alexandria during the precautionary period. (It should be noted that there is no need to appoint a liaison officer attached to the Brigadier Commanding the Canal Brigade as, under the agreement with Nahas Pasha of last July regarding the Frontiers Administration, an Egyptian liaison officer is already to be appointed in the Canal Zone.)20. I would conclude this despatch with a strong recommendation that the most urgent consideration should be given by the Committee of Imperial Defence to this plan and that action should be taken on the immediate recommendations contained therein as soon as possible. As reported in my secret telegram No. 607 of the 2nd November, at my first interview with the Prime Minister, His Excellency launched into a long and elaborate exposition of his fears regarding Italian aims. He showed grave preoccupations regarding the state of prepared-ness to resist an attack on Egypt, and even expressed doubt as to whether we in Great Britain were taking the matter sufficiently seriously; I must confess that I share the Pasha&apos;s fears. Nahas Pasha further stated that he had absolutely no faith in any assurances given by Signor Mussolini and that he believed that Italian aggression was sooner or later inevitable. In the circumstances, it is all the more of profound importance that the details of the Defence Scheme, so far as they are to be communicated to the Egyptian Government, should be in the hands of Nahas Pasha in the next few weeks, and that it should be possible to give him assurances that action on the urgent and essential points covered by the Scheme is being taken.I have, &amp;c. (Sgd.) MILES LAMPSON.APPENDIX III.Copy of a Telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to the Admiralty, No. 296, dated November 15, 1937.TELEGRAM No. 635, 13th November, to Foreign Office. Repeated to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, from Cairo.2. Paragraph 3 (b). As I pointed out in my remarks on J.P. 233, I consider risks to a slow convoy to be prohibitive, and to a fast convoy so considerable that our arrangements should be such as to avoid Mediterranean route as far as possible.3. Time factor only permits of Cape route being used if some military reinforcements are always at hand in Eastern Mediterranean. If garrison in Egypt must be kept within treaty limits, then Palestine appears only place where reinforcements can be maintained.   Our report of 24th October recommended
that existing garrison at Palestine should be considered as available for immediate reinforcement of Egypt, but a military force in Palestine in addition to present garrison would be, of course, far preferable. Anything which can be done to reduce personnel and material which have to be transported to Egypt either by Mediterranean or Red Sea routes will greatly reduce task of Fleet and free it to carry out operations against enemy Fleet and coasts.4. In the Red Sea the air menace will be far greater than that from surface ships and escort ships already allowed for in war plan and which will provide anti-aircraft protection for convoys will adequately deal with surface ships.5. When suggesting stationing of one light cruiser in Red Sea, N.L.O.,. Port Said, had not advantage of knowing provision which has been made in war plan for protection of convoys in Red Sea from air attack.6. A battery on Dumeira Island will no doubt be a nuisance, but a somewhat minor one compared to air menace. Channel to easward of Perim Island can be used and thus ships need not approach within 15 miles of Dumeira Island. Commander-in-chief, East Indies, is no doubt considering this question.7. As Their Lordships are aware, I have always considered a Fleet base in Cyprus as far superior to Alexandria if base in addition to being a repair base is also an operational base with an enclosed harbour capable of accommodating-whole of force which would be operative in Eastern Mediterranean. It is only by having both operational and repair base in Cyprus that we can : (a) Overcome difficulties of security given in 3 (d) of Ambassadors telegram, (b) Ensure necessary underground reserves of fuel, ammunition, mines and depth charges being available on opening of hostilities, (c) Remove great disadvantage that knowledge of movements of fleet in and out of Alexandria, which would be available for enemy, would almost certainly render abortive any operations designed to intercept enemy sea forces or supplies to Libya.8. I am aware that substitution of Cyprus for Alexandria as Fleet Base would involve some dispersion of military and air forces and considerably increase cost, but it appears that these would be justified to secure our position in the Mediterranean.9. As the construction of a base in Cyprus will take several years it will be necessary to use Alexandria as our operational base during those years and if a large dock can be constructed at Alexandria in less time than base in Cyprus can be completed, there is a great deal to be said for constructing a dock at Alexandria.10. I am of opinion, however, that even if a dock is constructed at Alexandria, it will not do away with necessity of constructing a base in Cyprus, but not necessarily at Famagusta.11. Subject to above I am entirely in agreement with Ambassadors proposals.APPENDIX IV.Copy  of  a  Letter  from  General  Officer  Commanding  British  Troops  inEgypt to the War Office.Sir, Cairo, October 28, 1937.I HAVE the honour to refer to paragraph 5 of the covering letter to the Combined Plan for Defence of Egypt, dated the 24t)h October, 1937.1. As stated in that paragraph, I concur in the view that in principle it is inadvisable to despatch Convoys by the Mediterranean route.2. I fully appreciate the Cabinet policy as explained in paragraph 2 of War Office telegram 50119 of the 23rd October, but feel it my duty to put forward my views as to the permanent change in the military situation brought about by the arrival of Italian reinforcements in Libya, and the danger that might arise should the political situation vis-a-vis Italy suddenly deteriorate at any future time.3. Although the proposed reinforcements from India are due to arrive in Egypt on Z plus 24 day, it would be inadvisable to rely on these units being in action in Egypt until Z plus 30 day.[16196] E
4. If Egypt is attacked from Libya by two motorised divisions with completely new equipment and perhaps with&apos; additional tank units attached, I submit, in view of the very great Italian preponderance in the air, it would be taking a grave risk to rely on the forces normally stationed in Egypt (which are in some cases much below war strength and whose armament has not yet been brought up to date) to hold out for a period of one month aided only by ill-trained and ill-armed Egyptian units.If my information is correct the Italians have sufficient M.T. to enable them to overcome the administrative difficulties of operating across the desert : in that case they would be in a position to maintain the pressure of attack.&quot;We might well succeed in inflicting a defeat on the Italian ground forces in the first week, either by direct or indirect attack, but we should be almost certain to suffer considerable casualties in the Mobile Force in so doing, both in personnel and armoured fighting vehicles, quite apart from normal breakdowns.All our troops would be in the front lines from the very start. There would be practically no reserve under my own hand, and the strain on the troops exposed to renewed attacks without any possibility of relief for a whole month might prove too much for them.5. I consider therefore that unless reinforcements of all kinds, including armoured fighting vehicles and A.A. units, can be brought into action within fourteen days we are taking a grave risk which would only be justified if the general international situation was such as to preclude the taking of necessary precautions beforehand in the Middle East.The need for fighter squadrons also need not be emphasised.6.   If that is accepted, there appear to be only two alternatives : (a) To station the necessary reinforcing units in the Middle or Near East.
