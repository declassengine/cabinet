THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 276 (37).CABINET.CLOSER  UNION  BETWEEN  SOUTHERN  RHODESIA.  northern rhodesia AND NY AS ALAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.FOLLOWING the decision reached at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 13th October (Cabinet 37 (37)), the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and I have been in touch with the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties, and have ascertained that they would be prepared to nominate members to participate in the proposed Royal Commission on the question of closer co-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Copies of telegrams subsequently exchanged with the Governor of Southern Rhodesia are attached. It will be seen that the Southern Rhodesia Government would view with favour the appointment of such a Commission on the basis proposed.2. A slight amendment of the terms of reference of the Commission has been suggested by Mr. Attlee. It is now contemplated that they should read as follows : &quot; To enquire and report whether any, and, if so, what form of closer co-operation or association between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland is desirable and feasible, with due regard to the interests of all the inhabitants, irrespective of race, of the Territories concerned, and to the special responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the interests of the native inhabitants.&quot;3. I have discussed with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs the question of personnel, and the Opposition Party leaders have already given us the names which they suggest. I hope to be in a position to put forward the proposed composition of the Commission, for approval by the Cabinet, when this Memorandum is considered.4. On further consideration, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and I feel that it would be well to increase the number of the Commission from 5. as previously proposed (see paragraph 6 of CP. 224 (37)) to 6, so that the Non-Parliamentary representatives may include, in addition to the Chairman, one with administrative, and one with financial, experience.5. It will be remembered that a pi-omise has been given to Mr. Huggins to let him know, before the Commission is set up, whom we have in mind as its members, and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and I are inclined to think that, for the reasons given in paragraph 6 of CP. 224 (37), it might be as well also to communicate the whole of the proposed names to the Opposition Party Leaders before an approach is made to any of the persons concerned.6.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and I would propose that, when the arrangements for the constitution of the Commission have sufficiently advanced, an announcement on the subject should be made in Parliament, and [16128]
simultaneously in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Nyasaland. The announcement would take the form of the explanatory statement in the enclosure to Appendix II of our Memorandum of the 30th September (CP. 224 (37)), modified as suggested by Mr. Huggins, with the terms of reference as set out above.7. This Memorandum is over my signature only, since Mr. MacDonald is in Brussels, but, as will be seen, it has been prepared in consultation and agree-ment with him.(Initialled) W. O. G.Colonial Office, November 11, 1937.Paraphrase of a Telegram to the Government of Southern Rhodesia.   Sent11 p.m., November 1, 1937.(No. 103.   Secret.)Should be glad if you will inform your Prime Minister that his letter of the 23rd August regarding the question of the closer association of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland has been considered by the Cabinet and that we are now prepared to agree that the proposed Commission should be free to review the whole position, including the question of possible eventual amalgamation, though we feel that we must make it clear that this must not be regarded as meaning that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom see any likelihood of their being able to depart, at any rate in the near future, from their view as to the necessity of maintaining their present responsibility in relation to Native policy in each of the Territories concerned. In the circumstances we are willing to accept modifications in the draft explanatory statement and terms of reference proposed by your Prime Minister, though in the latter we propose to substitute for the words &quot; the European and Native inhabitants&quot; the phrase &quot;all the inhabitants irrespective of race.&quot; If the appointment of a Commission on the basis proposed would be in accordance with the wishes of your Ministers, necessary arrangements will be proceeded with and a further communication will be sent to you as to these and as to the suitable date for making a public announcement.Paraphrase of a Telegram from the Government of Southern Rhodesia.   Dated November 4, 1937.   Received 2-19 p.m., November 4.(No. 100.   Secret.)Your telegram No. 103 of the 1st November, Secret.I have been asked by my Prime Minister to inform you that he has consulted his colleagues regarding the Commission proposed in your telegram, and that Ministers consider that its appointment would be regarded favourably by them.
