Accordingly, and in view of the urgency of the matter, I submit for consideration a draft of a Bill giving effect to the proposal contained in my Memorandum CP. 246 (37) to correct an. error of drafting in the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act, 1935.     The Bill has been prepared in accordance with a decision given by the Cabinet on 17th November, 1937, (Cabinet 42 (37), Conclusion 13.).2.     The provisions of the Bill,  in which the Secretary of State for Scotland concurs, are set out in the annexed Explanatory Memorandum of the Bill.3.     I shall be glad to receive authority to introduce theBill into the House of Commons at the earliest possible date.K.W.Deoember 3rd, 1937
Najtiqnal Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, Memorandum explanatory of the Bill.1. The object of the Bill is to remove an unforeseenconsequence of Section 2(2) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1936,  (formerly Section 10 of the National Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions Act, 1935), which was enacted for the purpose of preventing a growing tendency on the part of elderly persons who own a small business to transfer their business to a relative,  and to become employed in the business solely in order to secure an old age pension on a short period of insurance.2. It has now been confirmed by a decision in the HighCourt that the effect of this provision, as at present worded, is to exclude suoh a person from insurance as an employed contributor without removing the employment itself from the scope of employment within the meaning of the Act, with the result that the person is deprived of certain rights which normally accrue to those who oease to be insurably.employed. These rights include a &quot;free insurance period&quot; of 18 to 24 months, during which a person remains eligible for all health insurance benefits and widows1, orphans&apos;  and old age pensions, and a title to maintain insurance,  subject to certain conditions, by becoming a voluntary contributor.3, The Bill provides that employment of the kind in questionis to be included amongst the &quot;excepted&quot; (i.e, non-insurable) employments and is to be deemed to have been so included as from 2nd August, 1935, on which date the relevant provision of the Act of 1935 first came into operation.      The result will be that any person who was so employed on 2nd August, 1935 or who became or becomes so employed after that date will be treated aslo
having ceased or ceasing to be employed within the meaning of the National Health Insurance Act on 2nd August, 1935 or on the later date as the case may be and will be entitled to the privileges granted on the cessation of insurable employment.The Bill also provides for the revision in accordance with the law as amended of any adverse decision on a claim for widow&apos;s or old age pension during the period between 2nd August, 1935 and the passing of the Bill.4. The contributory pensions scheme throws upon theExchequer any residual deficiency as respects pensions payable under the scheme, while under the National Health Insurance Act the Exchequer defrays one-seventh (one-fifth in the case of women) of the cost of health insurance benefits and their administration.The Bill restores liabilities (including such part of the charge as will fall upon the Exchequer) which were inadvertently removed by the Section in its present form.      These liabilities are limited to any pensions payable in respect of persons who have died or attained age 65 within the &quot;free insurance period&quot; referred to above, and to health insurance and pensions benefits for those persons who exercise the right, now to be conferred upon them, to become voluntary contributors.The number of persons in respect of whom these liabilities will arise cannot be stated with any certainty, but it is improbable that they exceed a few hundreds.
