THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   November 1937.SECRET. Copy No. 11367-B.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.A PROPOSED RE-ORGANISATION.Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I ATTACH herewith a Memorandum by the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence, in which he makes proposals for a re-organisation of the various Committees, the effect of which would be much less formidable than it appears at first sight. The real purpose of the proposed changes is to simplify the organisation and to avoid unnecessary work.2. Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s proposal is to abolish the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements and the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee as separate bodies, and to merge them in the Committee of Imperial Defence. In practice, however, the work of these two Committees would, under Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s plan, continue exactly as at present.3. The Committee of Imperial Defence, in strict constitutional theory, consists of the Prime Minister and whoever he chooses to invite to the Committee. In recent years, especially since the Salisbury Committee of 1923-24, which recommended a permanent panel of members, the regular membership of the Committee has been stereotyped, subject to minor changes effected by each Prime Minister when he came into office. Although it is not proposed to alter the membership, there is no reason under the constitution of the Committee why, for particular subjects, it should not be varied. In fact, elasticity of membership is already practised to a considerable extent.4. If Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s plan is adopted, it is contemplated that the Committee of Imperial Defence would continue to hold fortnightly meetings on alternate Thursdays as at present. On the intermediate Thursdays the members of the existing Defence Policy and Requirements Committee would be invited to attend a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence at which the Defence Programmes and other matters at present disposed of by the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee would be dealt with exactly as at present. So far as the work and the personnel who do that work are concerned, the change would only be a nominal one. Exactly a similar procedure would be followed in the case of the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee. Its members would meet at irregular intervals, as at present, without addition to their number, the only change again being one of nomenclature.5. Sir Maurice Hankey gives a number of reasons for adopting this procedure, which I need not go into at length. The present system is rather inconvenient. It is often very difficult to say whether the business is appropriate to the Committee of Imperial Defence or to the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee, or to the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee. Owing to the importance of not missing an opportunity to secure a decision, questions often have to be dealt with by a Committee which constitutionally is not the most convenient body. This is very cumbrous from the point of view of indexing and filing, and generally in tracing the history of a question at short notice.   It may[16118] b
mean consulting three series of C.I.D. Minutes instead of one. There is also a doubt in a good many people&apos;s minds as to whether the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee is part of the organisation of the Cabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence. At the time of the Mediterranean crisis, for example, the Sub-Committee was reporting direct to the Cabinet and not to the Committee of Imperial Defence, with the result that by many people it is forgotten that it was established as a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, though with the right of reporting direct to the Cabinet when desirable. At present it usually reports to no one. It would be waste of time to report to the Committee of Imperial Defence, which is almost identical in compo-sition to itself, and the subjects are often not of sufficient importance to justify troubling the Cabinet.6. Similarly, the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee, though sometimes dealing with subjects that, strictly speaking,.are appropriate to the Committee of Imperial Defence or D.P.R., does not report to the Committee of Imperial Defence or Cabinet. In fact, the existence side by side of three Committees, all dealing Avith defence matters and all of equal authority, is a lop-sided and inconvenient arrangement.7. If the proposal to merge the three Committees were adopted, some state-ment might have to be made in Parliament, as the establishment of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee Avas mentioned in the White Paper of 1936 (Cmd. 5107). It Avould be unnecessary to mention the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee, as its existence has never been announced publicly.8. On the Avhole, I am in favour of the change and of the arrangements suggested by Sir Maurice Hankey for giving effect to it.(Initialled) T. W. H. I.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 3, 1937.
ENCLOSURE.A&apos; SUGGESTED RE-ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary. I. Introduction.I HAVE at present under consideration plans for improving the indexing system of the Committee of Imperial Defence which would involve some increase in staff. I should like to make this increase as small as possible, but the position has been complicated by the establishment of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements and the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee as separate and almost independent bodies.2. The system of indexing in the past has centred round the Minutes of the Committee of Imperial Defence. All the larger questions were discussed at the main Committee, to which also all the more important Sub-Committees reported either in the form of Memoranda on particular subjects or sometimes by means of annual Reports. It was comparatively easy, therefore, to have a single index for the main Committee, from the Minutes of which recommendations of Sub-Committees could rapidly be traced. Decisions by the Cabinet were brought into this system by the expedient of taking note of them at the main Committee.3. The index, which is an important and essential part of the organisation, however, has become rather complicated since the establishment, first, of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee, and, subsequently, of the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee, neither of which reports to the Committee of Imperial Defence. At present they have their own indexes, which tend to overlap with the index of the Committee of Imperial Defence.4. The exploration of the mechanical question of indexing has led to the view, which is shared, I think, by my colleagues in the Secretariat, that not only the indexes but the general work of the Committee would be benefited by absorbing&quot; the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee and the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee into the Committee of Imperial Defence. As this raises large questions of organisation the decision must rest with higher authority.II. The Sub-C ommittee on Defence Policy and Requirements.5. It will be recalled that in the autumn of 1933 an Official Committee known as the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee was appointed to prepare a programme for meeting our worst deficiencies, for transmission to the Cabinet. After preliminary consideration by the Cabinet, the Report of the original Defence Requirements Sub-Committee (dated the 5th March, 1934) was referred to a Ministerial Committee on Disarmament, which had originally been set up in January 1932, to deal with messages received from the United Kingdom Delega-tion at Geneva. Looking back, it seems an odd arrangement, as indeed it seemed at the time, to refer rearmament questions to a Disarmament Committee : but, it so happened that the personnel of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament was well-suited for the consideration of this first stage of rearmament.6. On the 29th April, 1935, the name of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament was changed to the &apos;&apos; Ministerial Committee on Defence Require-ments,&quot; since its work had by now become entirely confined to Defence Requirements. On the 1st July, 1935, after a rearrangement of the Cabinet, the Cabinet Committee was reconstituted under the title of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on Defence Policy and Requirements, with the following Terms of Reference :  (i) To keep the defensive situation as a whole constantly under review so as to ensure that our defensive arrangements and our foreign policy are in line.[16118]
(ii) To advise the Cabinet and/or the Committee of Imperial Defence, in the light of the international, political and financial situation, as to any changes in policy or in the programmes of the Defence Services that the Committee may deem necessary or desirable.(iii) To examine the plans and preparations of the Committee of ImperialDefence and of its Sub-Committees and of Departments concerned in order to ensure that these are effective and consistent with our general defensive policy; and to advise the Cabinet and/or the Committee of Imperial Defence as to our weak points and what steps should be taken to remedy them.(iv) To deal with any questions referred to it by the Prime Minister, theCabinet or the Committee of Imperial Defence. (C.I.D. Paper D.P.R.-1.)7. Prom section (iii) of the above Terms of Reference it will be seen that part of the functions of the new Sub-Committee was &quot; To examine the plans and preparations of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of its Sub-Committees,&quot; &amp;c. That is to say, one of its functions was to examine &quot; plans,&quot; a duty which has since been allotted to the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee. There is evidence also that the Prime Minister of the day (Mr. Baldwin) had in mind that the new Sub-Committee would, in the event of war, become a War Committee or War Cabinet a prospective role that is now allotted to the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee.8. Shortly after the establishment of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee, the Mediterranean crisis became acute, and it was that Committee which undertook, under the authority of the Cabinet, the general supervision of the arrangements made to safeguard the position.Consequently, during the autumn of 1935 the Committee met sometimes for the purpose of dealing with problems thrown up by developments in the Mediterranean, and sometimes to consider Defence Requirements. In mid-November 1935 the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee submitted its Third Report. This was examined intensively by the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee, which submitted a Report to the Cabinet on the 12th February, 1936. Since that date the Committee has been principally concerned with supervising the execution of the Defence Programmes, meeting, as a rule, under the Chairmanship of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence. For these purposes various changes have been made in the personnel, which is at present as follows : Members The Prime Minister (Chairman).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (Deputy Chairman).The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Lord President of the Council.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Labour.*Lord Weir, G.C.B *Expert Advisers First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Chief of the Air Staff.Colonel   Sir M.  P.  A.  Hankey,  G.C.B.,  G.C.M.G.,  G.C.V.O. (Secretary).Colonel H. L. Ismay, C.B., D.S.O. (Deputy Secretary).* For questions concerning the Programmes of the Defence Services only.
III. The Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee.9. In January 1937 the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee presented a Report -on the Higher Control of Operations in War (C.I.D. Paper No. 1297-B), and on their recommendation the Committee of Imperial Defence,* on the 11th February, 1937, in approving the Report, reached the following conclusion : &quot; To recommend to the Prime Minister that it is desirable that, as part of its permanent peace organisation, every successive Government should appoint a group of Ministers, which in the paramount interests of secrecy should be as small as possible, for the following purposes :  (i) To examine, from the point of view of Government policy, plans fora major war, submitted to the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence by either the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee or by the political heads of any of the Service Departments.(ii) To provide a possible nucleus of a War Committee or War Cabinetin the event of war.&quot;10.   The Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin) accordingly appointed a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence composed as follows : The Prime Minister (Chairman).The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.The First Lord of the Admiralty.&quot;The Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of State for Air.Colonel Sir M. P. A. Hankey, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., G.C.V.O.(Secretary).Colonel H. L. Ismay, C.B., D.S.O. (Deputy Secretary).with the following Terms of Reference : (i) To examine, from the point of view of Government policy, such defence plans as may be submitted to the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence from time to time by either the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee or the Political Heads of any of the Service Departments, (ii) To provide a possible nucleus of a War Committee or War Cabinet in the event of war.11. The Committee has held four meetings. In addition to two apprecia-tions of our plans for major wars submitted by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, it has considered a number of other questions, including The Standard of Naval Strength, The Role of the Army and its Organisation, Armament and Equipment, German and French Air Forces, Relations with Italy, the Italian Air Force, and Anglo-Portuguese Relations nearly all of which subjects had been discussed previously either at the Committee of Imperial Defence, or the Sub-Committee -on Defence Policy and Requirements, or both.IV. The Present Position.12. From the above it will be seen that there are now three distinct, though linked, organisations, namely :  The Committee of Imperial Defence,The Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements, The Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee,all more or less independent of one another, all dealing with defence questions without very definite lines of demarcation. The Chairman, the nucleus of the personnel, Technical Military Advisers and the Secretariat are the same for each of these three Committees. In practice the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee meet alternate Thursday* C.I.D./288th Meeting, Minute 3 (b).
mornings. The Defence Plans (Policy) Committee meets less often, though in time of war it would become the most important of the three and might well absorb the functions of the other two, just as in the Great War the War Committee and the War Cabinet absorbed the functions of the Committee of Imperial Defence.13. As already indicated, there is a good deal of overlap between the three bodies. Questions which might at first sight seem to belong more properly to the Committee of Imperial Defence, or, alternatively, to the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee, sometimes have to be dealt with at the other Committee, or even at the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee, for reasons of urgency, in order to avoid waiting for a week. There is obviously some confusion in Government Departments on the subject, as questions which properly belong to the one body are sometimes referred by Departments to one of the others. The Defence Plans (Policy) Committee has, for practical purposes, replaced the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee so far as item (iii) (plans) of the Terms of Reference to the latter are concerned. As a matter of organisation, therefore, the position, though not unworkable, is inconvenient and confused, and, as already mentioned, it is particularly difficult from the point of view of indexing.V. Suggested Reorganisation.14. It is suggested that the organisation could be simplified without detri-ment by reabsorbing the Defence Policy and Requirements and the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committees into the Committee of Imperial Defence.15. It will be recalled that, as frequently announced in Parliament, and in accordance Avith the original Treasury Minute of the 4th May, 1904, the Committee -of Imperial Defence is, in strict theory, composed of the Prime Minister, as President, with such other members as, having regard to the nature of the subject to be discussed, he may from time to time summon to assist him. This constitu-tional position possesses the immense advantage that the personnel of the committee can be changed according to the subjects to be discussed.16. By reverting to this original position there would not be the slightest difficulty in the Committee of Imperial Defence itself fulfilling the functions of the two Sub-Committees. The regular Thursday meetings would take place as at present. Broadly speaking, on one Thursday the Agenda would be that of a normal meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence to-day, and on the next Thursday the Agenda would be similar to that of the Defence Policy and Require-ments Committee, and the personnel invited would be the same as for the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee. In either case, however, it would be possible to include in the Agenda items that were ready and which otherwise would have to be reserved until the next meeting of the other body. The only change in practice would be that the meeting would always take place under the title of the Committee of Imperial Defence.17. The meetings to consider plans would take place periodically, as at present, again under the title of the Committee of Imperial Defence; the only difference being that a smaller personnel (namely, that of the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee) would receive invitations. Owing to the very secret character of the documents brought before the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee, which ought not to have even the comparatively restricted distribution of the documents of the Committee of Imperial Defence, it will be necessary to keep them in a -separate series. That is a matter which would present no difficulty to the Secretariat.VI. Difficulties.18. While the above organisation would undoubtedly have great advantages,, it is necessary to mention one or two difficulties, none of them serious, which would have to be surmounted.19. It will be recalled that in 1923-24 the organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence was overhauled by a special Sub-Committee under the Chair-manship of Lord Salisbury, whose Report was subsequently published as a
Parliamentary Paper (Cmd. 2029/1924). Among the recommendations of this Committee was the following : &quot; In accordance with the terms of the Treasury Minute of the 4th May, 1904, constituting the Committee of Imperial Defence in its present form, the Committee of Imperial Defence will continue to consist of the Prime Minister, as President, with such other members as, having regard to the nature of the subject to be discussed, he may from time to time summon to assist him. In pursuance of a decision by the Prime Minister, the Committee places on record that the following should be members : The Chairman (Deputy to the Prime Minister). The Secretary of State for War. The Secretary of State for Air. The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Financial Secretary. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Secretary of State for India. The Chiefs of Staff of the three Fighting Services. The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury as Head of the Civil Service.In addition to these, other British or Dominion Ministers of the Crown and other officials, or persons having special qualifications, will be summoned as members by the President according to the nature of the business.&quot;This recommendation did no more than stereotype a position which had been reached as the result of the practical working of the Committee over a long period of years. In practice, however, it has tended to limit the elasticity of the compo-sition of the Committee, to which great importance had been attached by Mr. Balfour at its foundation in 1904. It was the only recommendation of the Salisbury Committee to which I myself, as Secretary, was opposed, but my objections were over-ruled.20. The recommendations of the Salisbury Committee have, however, been departed from considerably at various times. For example, after the death of Lord Curzon, who was Chairman, that post became vacant for many years, as Mr. Baldwin decided himself to resume the Chair. Although Mr. Ramsay MacDonald had in 1924 deputed the Chair to Lord Haldane, when he became Prime Minister in 1929 he also decided to follow Mr. Baldwin&apos;s example and took the Chair himself. Both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Ramsay MacDonald added additional members to the panel given in the above quotation.21. It is suggested, therefore, that such slight variations from the Salisbury Committee&apos;s recommendations as might be involved in the proposals submitted in this Memorandum are easily defensible.22. At first sight, a difficulty might appear to arise in connection with the representation of the Dominions. At present the High Commissioners for the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa are given an opportunity to attend meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence when there are matters on the Agenda which concern their Dominions either in the first or second degree. Although the High Commissioners of these Dominions (or their representatives) attend a fair number of meetings in the course of the year, they are (in accordance with the original arrangement) not invited when the business does not concern their respective Dominions, and every year a certain number.of meetings of the Committee are held to which they do not receive invitations. The position is well understood by the Prime Ministers as well as by the High Commissioners of the Dominions referred to, and no difficulty is anticipated in explaining to the High Commissioners that the change of system might result in some addition to the number of meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence to which they were not invited.23. Another slight complication is that the existence of the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee was mentioned in the Statement Relating to Defence, 1936 (Cmd. 5107) in a passage in paragraph 47, an extract from which is attached in the Appendix.   If it is considered necessary, for political reasons.
to explain that a slight modification has been made in this arrangement, this could be done in some future Statement on Defence or verbally by the Prime Minister or the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.24. If it is asked why an arrangement which was considered necessary in 1935 is no longer necessary in 1938, the answer is that in the early stages of the transition from the atmosphere of Disarmament with the Ten-Year Rule to that of active reconditioning of armaments, new machinery was deemed to be desirable, just as, during the War, it was found desirable to set up a War Cabinet or War Committee, but experience has revealed considerable inconveniences and weaknesses in the emergency system, and it is now thought advisable to revert to the well-tried machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence.VII. Summary.25. The change which I submit is not one of substance, but only of form. The work will be done by the same Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, Officials and Secretariat as to-day. It is really no more than a change of nomenclature. I submit that the change will be justified by the considerable simplification combined with some increase in efficiency which would result.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 3, 1937.Appendix to Enclosure.Extract from paragraph 47 of the Statement relating to Defence, 1936(Cmd. 5107.)*K&quot; *7V *R* &quot;TV-BEFORE saying what these decisions are I should, perhaps, explain that the Committee of Imperial Defence of which the Prime Minister is Chairman has long been and must still remain an essential link in all matters of defence. This co-ordinating instrument must be in a continual state of development and adapta-tion to meet the circumstances of the time, and when the Government set themselves to the task of working out the defence proposals now under consideration, they set up last July a special Ministerial Sub-Committee, known as the Defence Policy and Requirements Committee, to keep the defensive situation as a whole constantly under review so as to ensure that our defence arrangements and our foreign policy are in line, and to advise the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence in the light of the international and financial situation as to any necessary changes in policy or in the defence proposals. I have mentioned this important Sub-Committee so that the references to it that I shall make in announcing the decisions that have been reached may be intelligible.It has been decided that, while the Prime Minister will retain, as he clearly must, the Chairmanship of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of the Defence-Policy and Requirements Committee, a Minister will be appointed as Deputy Chairman of these Committees, to whom the Prime Minister will delegate the? following duties : &apos; * 4^ 4t -h&quot; ^ ^

Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 301s  Meeting, held on November 18,1937.(6)-A PROPOSED RE-ORGANISATION  OF  THE   COMMITTEE  OFIMPERIAL DEFENCE.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1367-B.)(Previous references : OLD. Minutes of the 133rd Meeting, Minute 1, 178th Meeting, Minute 7, and 288th Meeting, Minute 3.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence which covered a Memorandum by the Secretary proposing a re-organisation of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 1367-B).THE CHAIRMAN said that the changes proposed were of form rather than of substance and would be of great convenience to the Secretariat. The Prime Minister had expressed his approval of the proposals.LORD SWINTON questioned whether any announcement in Parliament of the proposed changes was necessary. The Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee had been mentioned in public, but not the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed that no public announcement was necessary. Since the announcement had been made of the existence of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee, the situation had changed. The House of Commons was now satisfied that defence preparations were receiving the full consideration which was required, but this had not been the case at the time of the earlier announcement concerning the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee.SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that in drafting his Memorandum he had not intended to suggest that a public announcement was necessary, but he had thought it right to point out that the question might possibly be raised in Parliament. He suggested that, if the proposals were approved, they should be referred to the Cabinet, since certain members of the Cabinet who did not normally attend Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence were members of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee.[16177-1]
Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) To approve the adoption of the proposals contained in C.I.D. PaperNo. 1367-B for the absorption of the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee and the Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee in the Committee of Imperial Defence.(b) That no announcement in Parliament of the proposed changes wasnecessary, unless the matter should be specifically raised in the House.(c) That these conclusions, together with the Memoranda referred to above,should be reported to the Cabinet.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, November 18, 1937.
