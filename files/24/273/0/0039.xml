CP. No.   314/37.CABINS T india appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India,  dated .31st December 1937.Circulated for the information cf the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
9 K OCcnfidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 21st December 119.37,  issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.    The attitude of Congress Ministries towards law and order, which was so much discussed at the recent meeting of the All-India Congress Committee in Calcutta, was soon to he put to further tests,  and most of these Ministries are in one form or another faced with the necessity of keeping subversive forces in check while working out the constructive side of their programmes. To some extent their difficulties are of their own creation.    These Ministries came to office committed by previous Congress promises to a policy of tolerance.    In accordance with this policy,  restrictions on newspapers and unlawful associations have been widely removed;    a considerable number of prisoners convicted of &quot;political&apos;1 offences have been released;    under Congress pressure the removal of restrictions from detenus has been accelerated in Bengal;    in the United Provinces there is to be a jail delivery of about 3,000 ordinary prisoners -mainly for reasons of economy - and a similar scheme is contemplated in Madras.    Everywhere in Congress Provinces, almost complete liberty of speech has been allowed to agitators and,  in some cases, restrictions have even been placed on the reporting of their speeches by the police. Where,  as in one case in Madras,  a speaker has been prosecuted for sedition,  the Ministry has been severely criticised.    The Ministries thus find their hands tied in using measures to suppress disorder while, on the other hand,  the Left wing socialists,  covering as they do a considerable communist element and. in some Provinces
a not inconsiderable ex-terrorist element, have been emboldened to conduct open agitation, threatening peace and stability.    They have been busy organising strikes in industrial areas,  preaching agrarian revolution in rural areas and making intemperate speeches calculated to weaken the respect for authority,  and to undermine the morale of administration.    While these tendencies are mainly in evidence in Congress provinces,  their reactions are felt also in non-Congress provinces, where the bitter hostility of Congress to the Ministries in power, especially in Bengal and the Punjab, has thrown the Congress into alliance with those interested in promoting disorder in order to embarrass the Ministries.2-    Mr.  Gandhi has made no secret of his aversion from the Left wing tactics.    In a strong article entitled &quot;Storm signals&quot;, which he published in his paper &quot;The Harijan&quot; on 20th November,  he draws a clear line between these agitators and the true supporters of Congress,  and recognises in effect that issue must now be fought out between the Right and Left Wings.    There is evidence also that the Sight Wing,  consisting of the more stable elements supporting Congress,  are alive to the danger of revolution from the Left and are mobilising their forces to meet it. Nehru,  nearing the end of his presidentship,  will soon be free from the restraints of office and is evidently prepared to take up the challenge of the Right Wing.    The meeting of the Working Committee which is to take place next January will probably see the first real trial of strength.    In the meantime, Mr.  gandhis failing health removes to some extent his unifying influence and the
Ui 0support which he has always given to more moderate...counsel.3.    The Congress Ministries themselves, representing on the whole the right-wing hut doubtful which side of congress will ultimately control their policy, have under this handicap for the most part shown themselves ready to use their powers for prevention of disorder within the limits which they have imposed on themselves,  and have not lacked courage in facing criticism.    Firm action by the Bombay Government proved effective in dealing with serious trouble stirred up by Communist agitators in the criminal tribes settlement at Sholapur.    The same Government took prompt and adequate steps to uphold law and order in a strike promoted by the Communist Union in Ahmedabad,  and thus enabled a peaceful settlement of the dispute.    In Cawnpore, where the strike situation had been improving,  serious danger of a communal clash suddenly arose from the murder of a loyal Moslem mill overseer.    Immediate and effective s tepis were taken by the District Magistrate to prevent an outbreak and,  at an important party meeting,   the premier has since accepted the responsibility for this action.    As a result, confidence has been restored and the situation is now under control.    The United Provinces Government has been faced with another&apos; difficult situation arising out of the activities of certain ex-convicts of the Kakori conspiracy case and. of another released convict, Parmanand, all of whom have been touring the province and delivering violent and revolutionary speeches.    Latterly Parmanand had abandoned all restraint and a speech delivered at Dehra Dun on November 15th contained clear incitements to
violence.     The United Provinces Government have teen induced to order his prosecution under Section 124A, Indian Penal Code, hut further developments are at present uncertain.    In the meantime, these agitators visited the province of Delhi where they were served with restrictive orders,  on disobedience of which they have been arrested and are under prosecution.4.    Agrarian agitation,  promoted by kisan organisations in league with Congress Socialists, continues to be widespread in provinces where the Zamindari system prevails.    Acute tension exists between landlords and tenants in parts of Bihar, and in the United Provinces landlords have been finding difficulty in collecting their rents,  a development which may possibly affect the provincial revenues.5.    Communist agitation for a general strike continues in Bombay and its projected date now seems to be the middle of February.    In Calcutta the threat of a strike in the Electricity and Gas Companies has been renewed owing to the failure of the negotiations committee which was appointed when a strike was formerly imminent.    Workers have threatened to resort to sabotage if the strike materialises.6.    A number of minor incidents indicate the continued existence of communal tension, particularly in the Punjab,  Central Provinces and United Provinces.    No sex^ious outbreaks have however occurred.    It is noticeable that the Congress attitude toward theUioslcm League has been somewhat modified, and it is clear that it is recognised as a serious rival to be placated as far as
po s s ito 1 e.7.    The economic conditions and prospects continue to be favourable in most parts of India, but crops have suffered from the shortage of rainfall in the United Provinces and North-Y/est India generally. Unusually heavy rains in Madras caused serious floods in which some 23 lives were lost.    The damage in South Arcot is estimated at nearly 3 lakhs.    Funds were immediately provided for relief work.8.    The inaugural session of the Federal Court took place on December 6th,  and&quot; was attended by a large and representative gathering of the Bench and the Bar from all parts of India.    Press comment although usually unfavourable to Federation has not failed to recognise that the established Court represents an important step in the constitutional development of India.9.    North-^/est Frontier Province.  - Ov;ing to continued improvement in the situation it has been possible to withdraw some of the additional troops employed.    A few hostile gangs remain active,  and there has been some sniping of camps and posts.    In the middle of November the troops encountered opposition in the Shaktu valley,  where the casualties were 3 killed and 16 wounded; of the enemy 5 were killed and 7 wounded.   , The peace terms announced to the Bhitannis and Bakka ^Khels and Jani Khel Vaalrs^ have been complied with to a great extent.    The road construction programme is almost complete.
