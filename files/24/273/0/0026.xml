THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET Copy No.CP. 301 (37).CABINET.BRITISH NEWS ABROAD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(A)THE importance of taking steps to remedy the deficiencies in the presentation of British news and views to the world at large through the ordinary organs of publicity, in view of the intensive propaganda done by other countries, and in particular Germany, Italy and Japan, was recognised by the Cabinet when they decided that broadcasts in foreign languages should be conducted by the B.B.C., beginning with Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese. These broadcasts will provide bulletins of spoken British news for listeners in the Near East and South America. In form and content, but mainly by reason of the fact that they will be broadcast at fixed hours daily, these spoken news bulletins will not, generally speaking, be suitable for reproduction in the overseas newspaper press. In any case, owing to copyright restrictions, they could only be made available for such reproduction by special arrangement. The problem, therefore, of effecting an improvement in the quantity and quality of British news, and of world news from British sources, in the newspaper press abroad, remains unaffected by the decision recently taken. This problem of the &apos;&apos; printed &apos;&apos; word is certainly no less urgent than that of providing a &apos;&apos; spoken&apos;&apos; British news service, and it is one that calls for examination.The main British sources of news to newspapers abroad are Reuters and the British Official Wireless service. The British Official Wireless undoubtedly fulfils a useful and important function; it is much valued by responsible organs in some of the Dominions and many foreign countries; but as its news goes out with the label &apos; &apos;official&apos;&apos; its scope has to be limited strictly to British news, and its comment has to be very restrained. The problem of increasing the quantity and quality of British news, and especially of world news through British eyes, is principally, therefore, a matter of increasing the amount and improving the character of Reuters&apos; service. The present moment is a peculiarly suitable one for considering this matter, since Reuters have brought to the attention of the General Post Office the grave disadvantage at which they are placed in South America and the Far East in the face of intensive competition from foreign agencies.For many years past the principal countries of the world have been developing a type of &quot;broadcast&quot; telegraph service under which news messages are transmitted by wireless telegraphy for simultaneous reception in a number of different countries. In the United Kingdom this type of service is conducted by the General Post Office, mainly from their high power station at Rugby. Reuters make use of this service; but they have recently represented that their principal competitors abroad enjoy the advantage either of Government subsidies or of extremely low &apos;&apos; broadcast&apos;&apos; rates; and they have urged that they should be treated more favourably in this country. The General Post Office feel, however, that there is little or no scope for reducing the present transmission charges so long as these are calculated on a normal commercial basis. 9597   [16284]
It should, I think, be the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government to help Reuters to increase the length of the messages which they send abroad; (Reuters, apparently with good reason, attribute the greater success of the American agencies and Havas in South America largely to the fact that they can afford to send far more words on any given day.) Reuters have raised the matter in connection with South America and the Far East, but, as the Cabinet has already recognised in connection with broadcasting, the news situation in the Near and Middle East is of high importance, and in Europe at the present juncture it clearly requires attention.If means were found of giving Reuters assistance in this direction and a preliminary examination by the General Post Office has shown that this is not impossible if the Government were prepared to agree to the adoption of uneconomic rates which would be practically equivalent to the grant of a subsidy  I consider that the opportunity should be taken to effect an improvement in the content of Reuters&apos; news. Reuters is linked with various foreign news agencies under arrangements providing for the exchange of news. As a result, much news goes out in Reuters&apos; name which is in fact supplied by Havas, Domei (the Government-controlled Japanese agency), D.N.B. (the German Government-controlled agency), &amp;c.; in other words, a large quantity of Reuters&apos; news is not news seen through British eyes at all, but actually news seen through the eyes of foreign Governments. In this connexion it may be mentioned that Reuters have recently become the distributing agents in South Africa for the German &quot; Transocean &quot; service, which is Government controlled and propagandist in character. Such news is, no doubt, carefully sifted by Reuters; but it is clearly impossible for the process to be entirely satisfactory. It is recognised that this system of news exchange, upon which all modern international news agencies depend, cannot be changed; but it is important to mitigate, so far as possible, the unfavourable results indicated above. This can only be done by day to day consultation between Reuters and the Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government concerned, more particularly the Foreign Office. Reuters co-operation with the Foreign Office has not always in the past been close enough; at the present time there is good contact; but it would probably be possible to make an informal agreement with Reuters under which their co-operation with Government Depart-ments, and especially with the Foreign Office, for the purpose of excluding undesirable items of news and ensuring a more definitely British presentation of news and views than is at present the case, could be placed on a moi&apos;e definite basis and rendered far more effective. There is reason to believe that Reuters would not be unreceptive to such a proposal.The matter is extremely complicated, and I suggest that the Committee of the Cabinet presided over by the Minister of Health, which dealt with foreign language broadcasts and which remains in existence^ should be invited to examine in detail whether it is desirable and possible (a) to assist Reuters to enlarge their service of news to foreign countries; and (&amp;) to secure in return from Reuters an informal agreement designed to establish the closest possible contact between Reuters and Government Departments for the purpose of ensuring a more definitely British presentation of news.(B)I desire also to bring to the attention of the Cabinet another factor which seriously affects the amount of news with a British colour which appears in newspapers abroad. For some time past this country has been losing ground as a distributing centre for foreign news, with results which are causing uneasiness at home and overseas. This piwess appears to be principally due to post-war wireless developments. Paris, and to a smaller extent, Amsterdam, Rome and Lisbon, offer facilities for the bulk transmission of news by wireless which are far cheaper than in this country. Consequently, much of the European news distributed by the great American news agencies is now despatched from one or other of these centres, and consequently compiled on the Continent instead of in this country.It is, I think, indisputable that, in character and form, news items to some extent take their colour from the surroundings in which they are compiled, quite apart from deliberate garbling dictated by policy.   It is, therefore, disturbing
that more and more of the news, both about this country and about the inter-national situation, which is being sent abroad by the great American agencies, with their world-wide distribution, is compiled in a foreign, and often unfavourable, atmosphere. It seems consequently desirable that these agencies should be encouraged to bring back to London their European editorial centres. It is thought that, for a variety of reasons, they would wish to do so if equal facilities for bulk wireless transmission were available in this country.The Postmaster-General and I consider that this matter should also be examined by Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;s Committee.(C)Attention should be drawn to a difficulty which may arise under any scheme for reducing the Post Office rates for the ;&apos; broadcast&apos;&apos; transmission of news in favour either of Reuters only or of all Agencies. Cable and Wireless, Ltd., may consider that any such scheme would be contrary to their interests and may represent that an increase in press traffic by the Post Office &quot; broadcast &quot; service would be to some extent at the expense of the Company&apos;s services. Reuters, on the other hand, have always assured the Post Office that an increase in their use of the &quot;broadcast&quot; service would not be accompanied by a diminution in the volume of their traffic by the Company&apos;s services. If the scheme serves the purpose for which it is designed, it should lead to a large increase in the press traffic passing to and from London; and it is arguable that the net effect would not be unfavourable to Cable and Wireless, Ltd. It seems clear, in any event, that the desired improvement in the circulation of British news can only be secured if &quot; broadcast &quot; press rates can be offered in this country comparable with the very low rates which are now available in certain other countries.A. E.Foreign Office, December 8, 1937.
