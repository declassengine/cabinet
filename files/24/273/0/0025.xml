THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT41Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 300 (37).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.Irish Situation Committee.REPORT ON THE GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION AND THE PROSPECTS OF A SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.AT their Meeting on the 8th December, 1937 (Cabinet 46 (37), Conclusion 6), the Cabinet took note of a Memorandum (OP. 298 (37)) by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs covering the reply, as agreed by this Committee, to Mr. de Valera&apos;s despatch of the 24th November last, and were informed by the Secretary of State that it was proposed to follow up the correspondence by an early meeting of this Committee; by consideration of the Committee&apos;s conclusions by the Cabinet on the 22nd December; and by Meetings with Irish Ministers in the course of January.2. In pursuance of these arrangements we have had under consideration the following documents which are annexed to this Report as Appendices I, II and III respectively : (a) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on theGeneral Constitutional Position.   (Appendix I.)(b) A Memorandum by the Home Secretary, covering an account of a conversation with the Right Hon. J. M. Andrews, the Acting Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, on the 9th December, 1937. (Appendix II.)(c) A Memorandum, with a covering note, by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (prepared before Mr. de Valera&apos;s despatch of the 24th November was received) on the prospects of settlement of outstanding questions.   (Appendix III.)3. It will be convenient to deal first in. this Report with the General Constitutional Position, and secondly with the Prospects of Settlement of Outstanding Questions.General Constitutional Position. 4.   We attach (Appendices IV and V) two Memoranda on the constitutional position circulated to us in May and June last by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.    After very full and careful consideration of all the circumstances we then, as stated in paragraph 1 of Appendix I, unanimously[16335a] b
agreed to make the following recommendation to the Cabinet as to our general attitude on the constitutional position : &quot; That notwithstanding the latest Irish Free State legislation (i.e., the new Constitution) we should continue to treat the Irish Free State as remaining within the Commonwealth.&quot;5. As a result of subsequent informal discussions with Dominion represen-tatives at the time of the Imperial Conference it was ascertained that the other Dominions were all disposed to take a view similar to that proposed to be taken by the United Kingdom Government, namely, to treat the Irish Free State as remaining within the Commonwealth. It was, however, contemplated that there should be further communication with the Dominion Governments as to the precise form of any public statement on the subject (see Appendix I, paragraph 2).6. We now recommend the Cabinet to approve the formula set out in paragraph 4 of this Report as describing their general attitude on the constitutional position. On the assumption that this recommendation will be accepted by the Cabinet we have considered the form and method of the announce-ment of this conclusion. Before, however, any final decision on these points can satisfactorily be reached it is necessary to deal with an important matter, namely, the effect which the new Constitution purports to have in relation to Northern Ireland.The new Constitution vis-a-vis Northern Ireland.7. Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the new Constitution in its final form read as follows : The use of the word &quot; Eire &quot; or &quot; Ireland.&quot; Article 2 :&quot; The national territory consists of the whole Island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.&quot;Article 3 :&quot; Pending the reintegration of the national territory and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstat Eireann and the like extra-territorial effect.&quot;Article 4 :&quot; The name of the State is Eire, or, in the English language, Ireland.&quot;8. In paragraph 14 of Appendix I will be found the four alternative courses open to us. We fully agree with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that for the reasons summarised in paragraphs 15 to 20 inclusive of Appendix I, alternatives (a), (b) and (c) are open to very grave objection and should not be entertained, and that of the four possible courses the one least open to objection is (d), viz. : that while taking note of the term &quot; Eire &quot; or &quot; Ireland &quot; we should place on record in a suitable document, for publication, that we cannot recognise that the adoption of this name involves any right to territory or jurisdiction over territory forming part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, that we regard the use of the name &quot; Eire &quot; or &quot; Ireland &quot; in this connection as relating only to that area which has hitherto been known as the Irish Free State.9. The attitude of Northern Ireland is set out in Appendix II to this Report. As will be seen, Northern Ireland Ministers no longer press their suggestion that the title &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; should be changed to &quot; Ulster.&quot; They, however, insist that if there is to be no change of.name two conditions are essential if the position of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland is to be safeguarded.10. These conditions are (1) that &quot; a most categorical statement should be made by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, making clear our attitude towards Mr. de Valera&apos;s assumption of the title of &apos; Ireland,&apos; and stating in the simplest and firmest terms that on no account would we be prepared to accept
interference with the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland without the express approval of Northern Ireland itself.&quot; This statement should, if possible, be drawn up..after consultation with Lord Craigavon; and (2) that &apos;&apos; nothing affecting the position of Northern Ireland should be done in any negotiations with Mr. de Valera without some opportunity for Lord Craigavon and Mr. Andrews to make their case.&quot;11. We recommend the Cabinet (1) to approve the adoption of course (d) in paragraph 14 of Appendix I, viz., that we should take note of the new title, but make a declaration to the effect that &quot; Eire &quot; and &quot; Ireland &quot; describe only the twenty-six counties, excluding the six counties of &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; which are a part of the United Kingdom; and (2) to accept in principle the two essential conditions laid down by the Government of Northern Ireland and set out in paragraph 10 above.The Form and Method of Announcement of the Decision.Form.12. In Annex I to Appendix I will be found the text in the form approved by us of the draft Statement for Publication subject to any Dominion comments. We have invited the Home Secretary to show this draft to Lord Craigavon, and to ascertain his views on the question whether any further statement safeguarding the position of Northern Ireland (condition (1) in paragraph 10 above) is needed, which, in that event, we feel should be separately published, regard being had to the desirability of avoiding as far as possible controversy with Mr. de Valera on the subject of partition. Subject to the above^ we recommend the Cabinet to approve the text of the draft Statement for Publication in the form set out in Annex I of Appendix I.Method.13. The new Constitution will become effective on Wednesday, the 29th December, 1937. In normal circumstances the best and most convenient course would have been for the Statement to have been made in the House of Commons by the Prime Minister in reply to a Private Notice Question. Parliament will, however, adjourn on the 23rd December, and we see very great objection to the Statement being made before the new Constitution has actually come into force. We think it out of the question to delay the publication of the Statement until Parliament reassembles in February as we are satisfied that, in order to allay anxiety both here and in Northern Ireland, the Statement should be published as soon as practicable after the new Constitution becomes operative on the 29th December. In these circumstances we think that the best course will be for the Statement to be published by being communicated officially to the Press by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on the 30th December, i.e., 24 hours after the new Constitution has come into force.14. We have authorised the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in anticipation of Cabinet approval, to communicate the draft Statement, in confidence, to the Dominion Governments other than the Government of the Irish Free State, in order that, as arranged with the Dominion representatives last June, those Governments should be consulted as to the precise form of announcement of the conclusion reached. The Dominion Governments have been invited to reply as soon as possible. We recommend the Cabinet to approve the proposal of the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to communicate a copy of the Statement to Mr. de Valera on the 29th December, or 24 hours in advance of its publication on the 30th December.The Position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the Commonwealth.15. Paragraphs 6 to 11, inclusive, of Appendix I deal with the correspondence exchanged with Mr. de Valera on the subject of the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the Commonwealth. We agree with the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that it would be unwise to leave Mr. de Valera&apos;s unsatisfactory reply completely unanswered; if, for any reason, it should hereafter be found necessary.to publish the correspondence, we should in that case, perhaps, be open to a charge of negligence. We therefore recommend [16335a] b 2
the Cabinet to approve the proposal that, when communicating the terms of the Statement to Mr. de Valera on the 29th December, we should comment in our communication to him on his reply in a manner which made our position clear but reduced to a minimum the opportunity for further hairsplitting by him. The text of this comment in the form approved by us will be found in Annex II of Appendix I to this Report.  We submit this text for the Cabinefs approval.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations on the General constitutional position.16. Our conclusions and recommendations on the general constitutional position, and in particular on the issues discussed in Appendices I, II, IV and V to this Report, are as follows :  ;(1) We recommend the Cabinet to approve the following formula as indicating their general attitude on the constitutional position : &quot; That notwithstanding the latest Irish Free State legislation (i.e., the new Constitution) we should continue to treat the Irish Free State as remaining within the Commonwealth.&quot;(2) As regards the position in relation to Northern Ireland and the use in the new Constitution of the name &quot;Eire&quot; or &quot;Ireland&quot; we recommend the Cabinet to adopt course id) in paragraph 14 of Appendix I, i.e., that we should take note of the new name, but make a declaration to the effect that we cannot recognise that the adoption of this name involves any right to territory or jurisdiction over territory forming part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that the use of the name in this connection is regarded as relating only to that area which has hitherto been known as the Irish Free State. t(3) We recommend the Cabinet to accept, in principle, the two essential conditions laid down by the Government of Northern Ireland and summarised in paragraph 10 of this Report.(4) As regards the form and method of the announcement of the decision in (1) and (2) above, we recommend the Cabinet to approve subject to any Dominion comments the text of the draft Statement for Publication in the form set out in Annex I of Appendix I it being understood that steps will be taken to ascertain Lord Craigavon&apos;s views on the point whether a further statement safeguarding the position of Northern Ireland (condition (1) in paragraph 10 of this Report) should be published separately.(5) We recommend that the Statement for Publication, when finally approved, should be published by means of an official Government com-munication to the Press 24 hours after the new Irish Constitution becomes operative on the 29th December, 1937.(6) We recommend the Cabinet to authorise the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to communicate the terms of the Statement for Publication to Mr. de Valera on the 29th December, i.e., 24 hours before that Statement is to be published in the Press, and that in the communication to Mr. de Valera the Secretary of State should comment on Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply to our communication of the 3rd April regarding the position of the Irish Free State as a member of the Commonwealth in a manner which makes our attitude clear but - reduces to a minimum the opportunity for further hairsplitting by Mr. de Valera. If the Cabinet approve this course we recommend that approval should be given to the&apos; text of the communication to be made to Mr. de Valera on this subject contained in Annex II of Appendix I to this Report.(7) We invite the Cabinet to&apos; take note that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has confidentially communicated the draft State-ment for Publication in the form approved by us to the Dominions other than the Irish Free State, with a view to the replies of the Dominions being received with the least possible delay, and also that the Home Secretary has communicated the approved text of the State-ment confidentially to Lord Craigavon.
Prospects of Settlement of Outstanding Questions :  The proposed Conversations with Mr, de Valera.17. The essential part of Mr. de Valera&apos;s despatch of the 24th November last (for the full text of which Cabinet Conclusions 45 (37), Appendix) was as follows : &quot; The Government of Saorstat Eireann are satisfied that piecemeal discussion between civil servants on the economic and other aspects of the situation that would arise in the case of a major war can achieve no useful purpose until some prior understanding in principle has been reached between the two Governments. My Government consider it essential, therefore, that members of the two Governments should meet as soon as possible to consider all the important matters involved.&quot;An interim reply was returned to Mr. de Valera on the 4th December, welcoming the suggestion that a meeting of Ministers should take place, and promising a further communication as soon as possible. This reply has been circulated as CP. 298 (37).18. The detailed Memorandum on the prospects of reaching a settlement of the outstanding questions prepared by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (Appendix III to this Report) deals with these questions under the heads of (a) Defence;(b) Finance; and(c) Trade;and the summary at the end of the document makes provisional recommendations containing the outline of a suggested settlement under each head. It will be appreciated that these recommendations are not intended, in the event of their being approved by the Cabinet, to tie the hands of the Ministers chosen to act as negotiators on the United Kingdom side. On the contrary, it is intended to leave them discretion, as to (1) whether all, or only some parts (or none) of these proposals are actually made; (2) the priority in which the proposals are made; and (3) the moment in the discussions at which they are brought forward.19. We do not, however, contemplate that our proposals should be communicated to the Free State Delegation in the earlier stages of the negotia-tion. It will be desirable, firstly, to encourage Mr. de Valera to make a statement of his general views, and secondly, since the meetings are being held on his initiative, to give him an opportunity of opening the detailed discussions.20. The only point on which we suggest a departure from the recommenda-tions of Appendix III is on the question of the reserved ports. Further advice from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee is necessary, but we do not think that their terms of reference should take the form of the draft at paragraph 27 I (1) of Appendix III, which might be construed as an invitation to the Chiefs of Staff to form an estimate of the political as well as the military aspects of the policy under consideration.21. At our request, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence have undertaken to prepare amended terms of reference to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, on the lines of inviting the Sub-Committee to give an estimate of the military significance of the reserved ports to this country during a major war, which would cover the various possible situations, viz. : (a) a situation in which the ports are retained in our own hands, and theFree State remains friendly,(b) a situation in which the ports are in the hands of a friendly Free State,(c) a situation in which the ports are retained in our own hands, but theFree State is hostile, and(d) a situation in which the ports are in the hands of a hostile Free State.(A   copy   of   the   revised   terms   of   reference   is   annexed (Appendix VI).)
Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations on the Outstanding Questions.22. The following is a summary of our conclusions and recommendations in regard to the outstanding questions of defence, finance and trade, discussed in Appendix III to this Report:  Defence.I. (1) &quot;We have authorised the reference to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of certain military questions relating to the value of the Defended Ports (see paragraph 21 above and Appendix VI).(2) We recommend that subject to further consideration in the light of the Report from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee we should, as a part of a general offer to the Free State Government, indicate that we should be prepared to with-draw from the ports on condition that we secured a defence agreement under which the Free State Government would :  (i) put into effect our military advisers&apos; proposals for bringing the defencesboth of the reserved ports and of the whole coast of the Free State up to a proper standard of equipment and efficiency; thereafter maintain the defences at that level; and provide some small naval vessels and aeroplanes for coastal defence purposes;(ii) increase considerably the personnel of their defence forces generally;(iii) co-operate closely with us in defence matters, maintaining contact with us in the development of their defence plans, and inviting the advice of our experts in the organisation of their defence forces and equipment;(iv) purchase defence equipment, both for the defended ports and for their forces generally, from the United Kingdom, in all cases where it could not be locally manufactured in the Free State; (v) arrange for the erection and operation of one or more munitionsfactories in the Free State in consultation with our experts; (vi) take such other defence action as the Chiefs of Staff in their report may advise to be necessary.Financial.II. (3) We recommend, that, subject to further consideration in the light of the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, referred to under (I) above, as to whether we should decide to make general proposals to the Free State Government (a) we should offer to conclude a new Financial Agreement, in which (i) we should abandon our claim to Land Annuities payments; (ii) the Irish Free State would pay (a) R.I.C. judicial and civil pensions;(b) payments on account of local loans;(c) pensions* payable to ex-servicemen in the Irish Free Stateand administrative charges in connection therewith;(d) administrative expenditure connected with (a) and other minor expenditure, in addition to (e) payments now being made on account of damage to property in the Irish Free State;(iii) that as regards the R.I.C. Pensions payable in the United Kingdom and items (b) and (d) above, we should accept a lump sum settle-ment if that would be practicable for and more convenient to the Irish Free State than annual payments;(The financial effect of these various suggestions is sum-marised in the Annex to Appendix III to this Report.)* See concluding sentences of paragraph 13 of Appendix III. The arrangement proposed is that there should continue to be a Pensions Office in Dublin which, under the general directions of the Ministry of Pensions in London, would be responsible for payments to pensioners in the Free State area. This office would, however, receive its funds from the Free State Government and could perhaps be regarded in making payments as the agent of the Free State Government.
(&amp;) solely as a bargaining counter, we should not offer, in the first instance, to abolish our special duties entirely, but should express our willingness to reduce them to a level which would bring in, say, half of the annual sum which we are foregoing.Trade.III. (4) We recommend that we should accompany our offer of financial agreement with a renewed assurance that if a settlement of the financial dispute is reached, we shall be ready to abolish (or reduce- see (3) (&amp;) above) our special duties against Free State imports on condition that the Free State Government abolishes the special discriminatory duties against United Kingdom imports, and to enter into negotiations for a general trade agreement in the nature of our Ottawa Agreements with the other Dominions.Signed on behalf of the Committee :N. CHAMBERLAIN,Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 15, 1937.
APPENDIX I.SECRET. [I.S.C. (32) 129]CABINET.Irish Situation Committee.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.General Constitutional Position. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.AT the last meeting of the Irish Situation Committee on the 9th June (I.S.C. (32) 35th meeting) it was agreed : (1) That, notwithstanding the latest Irish Free State legislation (i.e., the new Constitution), we should continue to treat the Irish Free State as remaining within the Commonwealth;(2) That informal discussions on this basis should take place outside the Imperial Conference with representatives of the Dominions now in London, and that, if those representatives agreed generally with our views in the matter, a recommendation to this effect should be submitted to the Cabinet.2. The proposed informal discussions with the Dominion representatives took place on the 14th June and, as a result, it was ascertained that they were all disposed to take a similar view to that proposed to be taken on behalf of the Government here, namely, to treat the Irish Free State as remaining within the Commonwealth. It was, however, contemplated that, before any public statement was made, there should be further communication with the Dominion Governments as to the precise form of the statement.3. Assuming that the Cabinet approves the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this point, the question now remaining for consideration by the Committee is, therefore, in what form the decision should be announced. It is clear that the precise language in which the decision is formulated will need careful consideration.4. Since the matter was last considered by the Committee the new Irish Free State Constitution has been passed, with certain amendments, by the Dail and has been approved by a comparatively small majority at a referendum held at the time of the Irish Free State General Election in July. As a result of the election Mr. de Valera no longer has a completely independent majority in the Dail; his Party is equal in numbers to all the other Parties put together, and he is relying at present on the support of the Labour Party. This has led to certain difficulties regarding the Constitution which have not yet been overcome; nevertheless, it seems certain that the Constitution generally will come into force automatically, as provided in one of its Articles, six months after the referendum, i.e., on the 29th December this year.5. The changes made in the Constitution during its passage through the Dail have been examined, - but there is nothing to which I need call special attention except the fact that the title of the new &quot; State &quot; which the Constitution purports to set up is now to be not &quot; Eire &quot; but &quot; Eire or in the English language, Ireland.&quot; (Article 4.) The term &quot;Ireland&quot; is thereafter used in the English text, and in the subsidiary legislation which Mr. de Valera has since introduced. I deal more fully with this question later in this paper.[16335] b
6. It will be recalled that after the passage of the Irish Free State constitutional legislation at the time of the abdication, and prior to the formulation of the new Constitution, we had an exchange of correspondence with Mr. de Valera on the subject of the position of the Irish Free State as a Member&apos; of the Commonwealth. A copy of the correspondence was circulated to the Committee as the enclosure to my memorandum I.S.C. (32) 124. In the course of our communication to Mr. de Valera we said that we understood the position to be as follows : -&apos;&apos; (i) The Irish Free State desires to remain a co-equal Member of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, (ii) The Crown remains the symbol of the association of the Members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, (iii) The King&apos;s title remains unaffected by the legislation.   It is as king of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seasthat he continues as heretofore to exercise his functions in regard tothe external affairs of the Irish Free State.On this basis the United Kingdom Government have reached the conclusion that they are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Fi&apos;ee State as a Member of the British Commonwealth.-A&quot; X &quot;A&quot; &quot;7T&quot; TVThe Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa also are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth.&quot;7. Mr. de Valera&apos;s reply (Annex III to I.S.C. (32) 124) was not satis-factory in form, since he would not accept in unqualified terms the three bases set out above. I dealt with his reply in paragraphs 5 to 10 of my paper I.S.C. (32) 125, which is reproduced as Annex V to CP. 300 (37).8. Consideration of a reply to Mr. de Valera was deferred pending completion of the examination of the new Constitution. Now that the time has arrived for us to define in words our attitude to the situation created, it is for consideration whether, and if so how, we wish to pursue this argument with Mr. de Valera. It would be possible now to send a communication to him which would define our attitude regarding the Irish Free State&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth on the coming into effect of the new Constitution and which would also serve as a reply to his last note. On the latter point, if I am correct in assuming that Mr. de Valera does not desire to challenge the &apos;&apos; basis &apos;&apos; set out in our note as correctly describing the existing position, the reply to him now might be to the effect that what our previous document had sought to establish was the present situation without prejudice to either party&apos;s opinions as to the future.9. But, although I believe this assumption to be correct, it is possible that any further communication to him on this subject will not be accepted in silence but will provoke a further argumentative reply. On the other hand, it seems unwise to leave his unsatisfactory reply completely unanswered; if for any reason we find it necessary to publish the correspondence at some later date we should in that case be open to the charge of negligence. The point for the Committee to consider, therefore, is, I suggest, what procedure can be devised which will enable&apos; us to reply to Mr. de Valera and at the same time minimize the risk of provoking further controversy with him.10.   In all circumstances I propose the following procedure : &apos;(1) We should draw up a brief statement on our attitude to the Irish Free State&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth. This should refer to the fact &quot;that the other Dominions have informed us that they concur in that attitude; and the statement should therefore be telegraphed to them for their approval.
(2) This statement should be made public either in answer to a Question immediately on the reassembly of Parliament, or if, as seems likely, it is desirable to make our position clear before the reassembly of Parliament, in some other appropriate form. I do not think it desirable that the statement should be made in anticipation of the new Irish Free State Constitution coming into effect on the 29th December.(3) We should communicate the terms of this statement to Mr. de Valera a day or two in advance of its publication, and in that communication to him we should comment on his reply referred to in paragraph 7 above in a manner which made our position clear, but reduced to a minimum the opportunity for further hair-splitting by him.11. For the consideration of the Committee I append drafts of (a) the Statement for publication and (&amp;) the communication to Mr. de Valera as Annexes I and II. But before these are considered there is another point which arises on the Constitution itself to which I think we must make some reference in the course of the public statement on our general attitude and for which I have therefore made provision in the draft statement. That point concerns the effect which the Constitution purports to have in relation to Northern Ireland.The Position in Relation to Northern Ireland.12.   Article 2 of the Constitution provides : &quot; The national territory consists of the whole Island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.&quot;Article 3 provides :- &quot; Pending the reintegration of the national territory and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstat Eireann and the like extra-territorial effect.&quot;13. It seems desirable that in any case we should not allow these Articles to pass without some comment from us. My colleagues will remember that I referred to the matter in one of my recent talks with Mr. de Valera (CP. 228 (37), page 3). But quite apart from this we cannot well avoid comment, for when the new Constitution comes into effect the provisions of Article 4, which establishes the new name of the State, will also come into effect. The original draft of this Article provided that the name should be &quot; Eire,&quot; but as a result of an amendment accepted by Mr. de Valera in the course of the Dail debates the Article now reads &apos;&apos; the name of the State is Eire or, in the English language, Ireland.&quot; The Irish Free State Government no doubt intend to use this term in future in all communications and other documents such as treaties; and they are already following the procedure adopted by other Governments in similar positions and are addressing communications to all the Governments with whom they have relations asking that this term may in future be adopted.14. We shall have to express our attitude on this matter. There seem to be four alternative courses to choose between: we could (a) refuse to recognise the new title and continue calling the State the Irish Free State, (&amp;) refuse to recognise the new title to the extent of inventing at least for our own use some new term in the nature of a convenient compromise, such as &quot;Free State of Ireland,&quot; (c) acquiesce in the new title without any comment, or (d) acquiesce in the new title, but make a declaration to the effect that &quot;Eire &quot; and &quot; Ireland &quot; describe only the twenty-six counties excluding the six counties of &quot;Northern Ireland &quot; which are a part of the United Kingdom.15. As regards course (a), undoubtedly the best solution from our point of view would be if we could get Mr. de Valera and his colleagues&apos; to agree that at least &apos;&apos; pending the reintegration of the national territory&apos;&apos; the title Irish Free State should continue to be used. But I am afraid that there has never been any chance of getting Mr. de Valera to agree to this. He apparently feels strongly that the title &apos;&apos; Irish Free State &apos;&apos; was one of the things imposed on the Irish by the [16335] n 2
British in 1921, and at the time of the campaign for the referendum on the Constitution he was reported as declaring that &apos;&apos; The new Constitution gave the name of Eire to the State, and they would hear no more of the Free State once the Constitution was put in operation.&quot;16. Whilst not attempting to prevent the Free State Government from using whatever title it chose, we might ourselves continue to refer to the country as the Irish Free State. Mr. de Valera&apos;s attitude described in the quotation above might well lead him in that case to take up an intractable position. He is capable of refusing to receive communications addressed to the Government of the Irish Free State even though his own country might be the principal sufferer from such obstinacy. But the main argument against adopting this course seems to me to be that to insist on using the old title &apos;&apos; Irish Free State &apos;&apos; might well place us in an extremely awkward position, first in relation to other countries, and secondly in relation to His Majesty the King. It is practically certain that foreign countries whom the Irish Free State are approaching with a request for the recognition of the term &quot;Eire&quot; or &quot; Ireland &quot; will be prepared to accord such recognition. Certainly if the matter were called in question at all, the United States of America would not be likely to oppose Mr. de Valera&apos;s wishes in this matter, whilst Germany and Italy might regard this as a convenient occasion for ingratiating themselves with the new State. Moreover, some at least, if not all, of the other Dominion Governments would be reluctant to adopt our attitude in the face of a request from a fellow Dominion.17. The position of His Majesty must also be borne in mind. The Irish Free State Government, acting under the External Relations Act, will presumably present to the King for signature a number of documents of various kinds, which would explicitly use the term &quot; Erie &quot; or &quot; Ireland &quot; as relating to the State. Clearly the King could&apos; not refuse to sign such documents without challenging the whole basis of procedure under the External Relations Act, and inviting the Republicans in the Free State to carry amendments to that Act which would eliminate him altogether. On the other hand, if he did so sign, it would be very awkward that we should in our documents employ a different term in relation to the Irish Free State.18. I feel, therefore, that it would be a mistake for us to insist on continuing to use the title &quot; Irish Free State.&quot;19. I feel that the same objections are valid against the second alternative (6), i.e., that we should invent at least for our own use some term in the nature of a convenient compromise, such as &quot; Free State of Ireland.&quot;20. The next alternative (c) is to acquiesce in the employment of the new title without comment. But it seems to me that this would be open to the gravest objection. If we were to accept the change sub silentio, would not our action be tantamount to a recognition of the claim set forth in Clauses 2 and 3 of the Constitution, quoted above, to the whole of the island ?21. The fourth alternative (d) is that, while acquiescing in the use of the term &quot; Eire &quot; or &quot; Ireland,&quot; we should place on record in a suitable document, for publication, that we do not accept or admit in any way the claim to jurisdic-tion over the whole of the island of Ireland set forth in the Constitution, and, further, that, in acquiescing in the use by them of the term &quot;Eire&quot; or &apos;&apos; Ireland &apos;&apos; as the name of the State, we regard it as involving the limitation of the meaning of the term in political usage to the territory over which the Irish Free State at present actually exercises jurisdiction, that is to say, the twenty-six counties, excluding the areas which, though geographically part of the island of Ireland, form part of the United Kingdom. There would, in fact, be a clear political separation between Ireland and Northern Ireland.22. There are various arguments against the adoption of this course. It would at first seem doubtful, for instance, whether any such plan would be acceptable to Northern Ireland, or to many of the Government&apos;s supporters in this country. The Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and I therefore took an opportunity of discussing the point tentatively and informally with Lord Craigavon when he was in London in July. Lord Craigavon then took the line that, whilst the relevant Articles in the new Irish Free State Constitution and
the proposed new title were very objectionable, it would be a mistake to take too much notice of them. He was in favour of reducing controversy to a minimum, and so far as Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution were concerned, the Northern Ireland Government had contented themselves with declaring, in answer to a question in their Parliament, that The Free State Government has no jurisdiction over Northern Ireland and our constitutional position within the United Kingdom is fully protected by the Government of Ireland Act and other Statutes of the Imperial Parliament. No special steps are, therefore, required to safeguard the maintenance of our full citizenship within the United Kingdom.&quot;23. So far as Mr. de Valera&apos;s proposed new title for the State is concerned, Lord Craigavon seemed indisposed to react violently to it, but suggested that retaliatory legislation might be introduced in the Northern Ireland Parliament changing the official title of Northern Ireland to &quot; Ulster.&quot; But he added that if this would require legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament as well, he was opposed to that action. He would then be content with the Northern Ireland Government doing whatever it could in the way of legislation without fresh authority from Parliament at Westminster. This whole question has been examined by the Law Officers, who have advised that the change of name could only be made by altering the provisions of the Government of Ireland Act. The question therefore arises whether in these circumstances Lord Craigavon would be willing to acquiesce in the attribution to the Free State of the title of &quot; Ireland.&quot; I understand that the Horne Secretary has had; a conversation with Mr. Andrews, the acting Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, on this matter, which he will report to the Committee.*24. Another difficulty about the adoption of course (d) is in connection with the King&apos;s title, the relevant part of which now reads &quot; of Great Britain, Ireland, &amp;c, King.&quot; Although it can properly be argued that these terms are to be read in their geographical sense, the recognition of a new State called &quot;Eire&quot; or &quot; Ireland &quot; might cause much confusion on the point, and lead people in Northern Ireland to claim that some alteration ought to be made in order to make it perfectly clear that Northern Ireland forms part of the King&apos;s dominions. But amendment of the King&apos;s title would present serious difficulties; it would be necessary, under the preamble to the Statute of Westminster, to obtain legislation both in the United Kingdom and the Dominions including, presumably &apos;&apos; Eire &apos;&apos; or &quot; Ireland.&quot; I think that the point can be adequately met by insistence on the fact that the expressions used in the Royal Title are geographical expressions (e.cj., the term Great Britain itself is indisputably geographical).25. In all the circumstances I think that course (d) is the least of four evils, and I recommend its adoption. It is perhaps worth considering using always the Irish term &quot; Eire &quot; when referring to the State, and ourselves avoiding the use of the term &quot; Ireland,&quot; except to describe the whole island as a geographical entity.Summary.26.   To sum up, my proposals are that: (1) We should draw up a brief statement on our attitude to the Irish Free State&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth. This should refer to the fact that the other Dominions have informed us that they concur in that attitude, and the statement should therefore be telegraphed to them for their approval.(2) With regard to the proposed new title of the State, i.e., &quot;Eire&quot; or &quot; Ireland,&quot; we should acquiesce in its use but make a declaration, to be included in the statement referred to in (1) above, to the effect that &apos;&apos; Eire &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; Ireland &apos;&apos; describe only the 26 Counties and do not include the 6 Counties of Northern Ireland which are a part of the United Kingdom. (This is a matter between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State, and we need not, therefore, expressly consult the other Dominion Governments as to the terms of the paragraphs, though we should, of course, inform them in advance of the line we propose to take.)* See Paper I.S.C. (32) 130.
(3) These statements should be made public either in answer to a Question immediately on the reassembly of Parliament, or if, as seems likely,, it is desirable to make our position clear before the reassembly of Parliament, in some other appropriate form. I do not think it desirable that the statement should be made in anticipation of the new Irish Free State Constitution coming into effect on the 29th December.(4) We should communicate the terms of the statements to Mr. de Valera a day or two in advance of their publication, and in that communication to him we should comment on his reply to our communication of the 3rd April regarding the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the Commonwealth (see paragraph 7 above) in a manner which makes our position clear, but reduces to a minimum the opportunity for further hair-splitting bv him.M. M.December 1937.Annex I.Draft of suggested Statement for Publication.(As revised by the Irish Situation Committee.)HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have considered the position created by the new Constitution which was passed by the Parliament of the Irish Free State in July 1937, and came into force on the 29th December. They are prepared to treat the new Constitution as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State, in future to be described under the new Constitution as Eire or Ireland, as a member of the British Common-wealth of Nations.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have ascertained that His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa are also prepared so to treat the new Constitution.With regard to articles 2, 3 and 4 of the new Constitution, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom take note of the proposed use of the name Eire or Ireland, but they cannot recognise that the adoption of this name involves any right to territory or jurisdiction over territory forming part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They therefore regard the name Eire or Ireland in this connection as relating only to that area which has hitherto been known as the Irish Free State.Annex II.Draft of suggested Communication to the Irish Free State Government.(As approved by the Irish Situation Committee.)THE United Kingdom Government have arranged for the following statement to be published on : [Flere insert text of suggested statement for publication (Appendix I).]Pending their consideration of the effect of the new Constitution, the United Kingdom Government * have refrained from r-eturning any reply to the note communicated by the High Commissioner to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the 27th April. They do not feel it necessary to make any comments regarding that note except to say that the object of their previous communication handed to Mr. Dulanty on the&apos; 3rd April was to state their understanding of the facts of the situation, without prejudice to any views which might be held as to the future constitutional development of the individual members of the Commonwealth.
SECRET.APPENDIX II.[I.S.C. (32) 130jCABINET.Irish Situation Committee.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of the Committee, an account of a conversation with the Right Hon. J. M. Andrews, the Acting Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, on the 9th December, 1937.S. H.December 10, 1937.MY colleagues will remember that I informed the Cabinet that Mr. Andrews was coming to London to discuss with me on behalf of the Government of Northern Ireland certain questions connected with the Irish situation.The first object of the visit was to give me the chance of eliciting the present views of the Government of Northern Ireland on the situation likely to be created by the substitution of the name &quot; Ireland &quot; for that of the &quot; Free State &quot; in the new De Valera constitution. In the previous discussion that the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for the Dominions and I had with Lord Craigavon on this subject, it was considered that the best of several unattractive alternatives was that after the Free State constitution had come into force the Government of Northern Ireland should assume to itself by local legislation the name of Ulster. At that time Lord Craigavon felt that unless some such action was taken in Northern Ireland there would be created a deep feeling of resentment in the loyalist ranks. We then assumed that this action could be taken by local legislation. In order, however, to make sure of the position we decided to consult the Law Officers. The Law Officers have now given their opinion that such local legislation would be ultra vires, and that legislation by the Imperial Parliament would be necessary if the change of name were to be made. It was this new situation that I desired to discuss with Mr. Andrews.When I put to Mr. Andrews the possible alternative and pointed out the obvious disadvantages that would be involved in Imperial legislation, he told me, with the authority of Lord Craigavon, that they no longer wished to press for the change of name. If, however, there was to be no change of name, two conditions seemed to them to be essential if the position of the United Kingdom in general, and Northern Ireland in particular, was to be safeguarded.In the first place it was necessary that a most categorical statement should be made by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, making clear our attitude towards Mr. De Valera&apos;s assumption of the title of &quot; Ireland &quot; and stating in the simplest and firmest terms that on no account would we be prepared to accept interference with the jurisdiction of the Government of Northern Ireland without the express approval of Northern Ireland itself. Such a statement should, if possible, be drawn up after consultation with Lord Craigavon.Secondly, it was essential that nothing affecting the position of Northern Ireland should be done in any negotiations with Mr. De Valera without some opportunity for Lord Craigavon and Mr. Andrews to make their case. Both of them were strongly of opinion that Mr. De Valera needed an economic agreement even more than the United Kingdom needs it, and that the only effective lever that we still had with him in the political field was the lever of the Annuities.They, themselves, were anxious about the negotiations taking place at all within a few days or weeks of Mr. De Valera&apos;s repudiation of his constitutional
obligations. It appeared to them both strange and dangerous that within a few days of Mr. De Valera creating a de facto Irish Republic and throwing out a provocative challenge to Ulster he should be received in London by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers and treated as a plenipotentiary in a negotiation that, if it ended in anything, would end to his great advantage. If, however, negotiations must take place, it was essential that the interests of Northern Ireland should be closely and sympathetically considered. As things were at present, Northern Ireland had incurred very serious damage from the economic war between the Free State and the British Government. Exports from Northern Ireland to the Free State had been enormously reduced or actually prohibited. The distributing trade, a very important Belfast industry, had been destroyed so far as business in the Free State was concerned. These serious facts must be taken into account in the negotiations, particularly as the negotiations might end by giving the Republican Free State better financial terms than loyalist Ulster.It was also essential that if there was to be an agreement, the opportunity should be taken to clear up with Mr. De Valera certain outstanding cases, for instance, the Moore case, in which a family had been misappropriated from rights that they had possessed in the fisheries of Loch Erne under a title that had been unquestioned for three centuries.Again and again Mr. Andrews insisted that Mr. De Valera could not get on without an economic settlement with Great Britain and that it would be folly to give away the lever of the duties without receiving substantial advantages as a return for our concessions.I asked him whether he wished that representatives of the Government of Northern Ireland should take part in the negotiations. He answered that this was certainly not his wish. Any such participation in the negotiations would compromise his position with the loyalists in Northern Ireland. He did, however, hope that Lord Craigavon and he would be kept fully informed of any develop-ments that might concern Ulster and that we should take the opportunity of consulting them either during the negotiations or before Mr. De Valera&apos;s arrival.He finally warned me against the belief that successful negotiations would strengthen the moderate forces in the Free State. He took the view that Mr. De Valera would regard the result as another trophy extorted from Great Britain, and declared that the whole history of Southern Ireland pointed to the victory of extreme and the defeat of moderate forces.He left with me the following note based upon the late Mr. Pollock&apos;s diary : &quot; In 1932 Mr; Pollock was at Ottawa for the Ottawa Conference and was concerned with the efforts which the Free State representatives were making to get special concessions.Mr. Pollock asked Mr. Baldwin for a special interview on Saturday, the 23rd July, 1932, and pointed out how the Free State were using their tariffs as a weapon against Ulster trade and the extent to which Londonderry in particular had been hit by the setting up of the Free State. In his diary Mr. Pollock records &apos; Mr. Baldwin fully appreciated the arguments and promised that before any permanent form of mutual tariffs was settled with the Free State our Government would be consulted. This assurance was freely given without any pressure on my part and I was fully satisfied with my interview, which lasted twenty minutes.&apos;Subsequently, Mr. Pollock also saw Mr. Runciinan on the matter during the Ottawa Conference.&quot;S. H.December 9, 1937.
APPENDIX illSECRET.[I.S.C. (32) 128ajCABINET.Irish Situation Committee.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Prospects of Settlement of Outstanding Questions. Introductory note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE attached Paper was prepared before &quot;Mr. de Valera&apos;s despatch of the 24th November (I.S.C. (32) 126) was received. The communication from Dublin to some extent modifies the position, but not, I think, in essentials. I would not now suggest that the proposals recommended in this Paper should be communi-cated to Mr. de Valera before the meeting between United Kingdom and Irish Free State Ministers which is to take place. This meeting should first commence, and Mr. de Valera will no doubt start by expressing his general views and making out his case. But I doubt whether he will make any specific proposals for a settle-ment of the three questions with which this Paper is, and the meeting will be, primarily concerned, and I still think that the deadlock is extremely unlikely to be broken unless we ourselves make proposals.I therefore suggest that (subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff on the question referred to in paragraph 7) we should approve proposals on the lines contained in this Paper for use by our representatives in the discussions with the Irish Free State Ministers, if in their judgment such proposals could wisely be put forward in the course of those discussions. I think we should leave our negotiators discretion, as to (1) whether all, or only some parts (or none), of these proposals are actually made, (2) the priority in which the proposals are made, and (3) the moment in the discussions at which they are brought forward. A good deal will depend upon the frame of mind in which we find Mr. de Valera and his colleagues.M. M.December 1937.[163351c
SECRET.[I.S.C. (32) 128.)CABINET.Irish Situation Committee.RELATIONS WITH THE -IRISH FREE STATE.Prospects or Settlement of Outstanding Questions. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN my paper CP. 228 (37), with which I circulated notes of my recent talks at Geneva with Mr. de Valera, I promised to circulate a paper on the whole situation for consideration by the Committee. I am dealing in a separate memorandum (Paper I.S.C. (32) 129) with constitutional questions which the Committee have still to consider. The present memorandum deals with questions concerning defence, the financial dispute and trade. For the sake of convenience, I discuss these matters under their separate heads, but I think that in any discussions or negotiations with the Irish Free State Government we should continue, for the present at any rate, to treat them as interdependent parts of a single question. It may be that later on, if we get into negotiation, we shall find that Mr. de Valera will not agree to any proposals that we would regard as reasonable on the financial dispute, but that we could get an agreement which, in all the circumstances, was worth while on the defence question alone. In that case we should presumably be ready to consider the conclusion of the latter whilst leaving the financial and trade disputes unsettled.2. My own view is that, subject to the advice of the Chiefs of Staff on the important question which I propose in paragraph 7 that we should submit to them, we should now make to the Irish Free State Government a set of proposals covering defence, the financial dispute and trade. I realise the disadvantages attaching to our coming forward with such comprehensive proposals, but can see no other means of making progress. On the other hand, I think there is some chance of securing a comprehensive settlement of these three questions if we do take this initiative.Defence.3. I deal with the question of defence first, because it seems to me that, before we can consider whether we are in a position to make any proposals at all, we must seek the advice of the Chiefs of Staff on one very important question. It will be remembered that in May 1936 the C.I.D. approved the following-recommendations submitted by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee concerning the possible transfer of the defended ports :  (i) That the most satisfactory arrangement, if it should prove feasible, would be a better general understanding with the Irish Free State, which would enable our defence forces to establish the same close relations with the corresponding Irish Free State Services as they already enjoy with those of the other Dominions.(ii) Provided improved relations are assured, despite the risks involved, itwould be desirable to offer to hand over the complete responsibility for the defences of the reserved ports to the Irish Free State.(iii) That the Irish Free State should be asked (a) To supply the necessary auxiliary naval vessels for the general harbour defence of the ports, and that if they wished to do more than this and supply some destroyers as well, they should not be discouraged from doing so.
(b) To take over the whole of the coast defences (guns and lights) andto assume financial responsibility for the modernisation of these defences in due course.(c) To place flying facilities at the ports at the disposal of the RoyalAir Force, to consider the provision of air forces for coastal defence, and to concert plans with the Air Ministry for the co-operation of this force with the Royal Air Force, in case of emergency.(iv) That the defences of the ports, after handing over, should be periodically reviewed in co-operation with the Irish Free State to ensure that they are kept up to date.(v) That our desire for complete assurance of the availability of these portsfor use by our Forces and for the adequacy of their defences, in the interests of the safety of the territory and communications of the Irish Free State no less than of the United Kingdom, should be made clear to the Irish Free State Government before any technical discussions are instituted to cover the actual process of handing over.(vi) That, as part of a general improvement of relations, consideration should be given to the question of relaxation of our present attitude towards the Irish Free State in regard to secret matters of defence generally.The substance of these proposals was put informally to the Irish Free State at the meetings between officials held last year to consider the possibilities of a general settlement, but these discussions led to no result.4. I am afraid that it is clear from my conversations with Mr. de Valera that the question of an assurance with regard to our use of the defended ports in time of war will prove a very serious difficulty. Indeed, I think we must accept it as a fact that he will not, because of his domestic political difficulties, give us any such assurance; the most that we can obtain is a repetition of the assurance which he has already given* that he will take all necessary measures to deny the use of Irish Free State territory to an enemy of this country, and that if his own forces are inadequate for this purpose he will invite the assistance of ours. Apart from this point, the general heads of the understanding, which it seems possible to secure from Mr. de Valera, would appear to be that the Free State Government would : (i) put into effect our military advisers&apos; proposals for bringing the defences both of the reserved ports and of the whole coast of the Free State up to a proper standard of equipment and efficiency; thereafter maintain the defences at that level; and provide some small naval vessels and aeroplanes for coastal defence purposes;(ii) increase considerably the personnel of their defence forces generally;(iii) co-operate closely with us in defence matters, maintaining contact with us in the development of their defence plans and inviting the advice of our experts in the organisation of their defence forces and equipment;(iv) purchase defence equipment, both for the defended ports and for their forces generally, from the United Kingdom in all cases where it could not be locally manufactured in the Free State; (v) arrange for the erection and operation of one or more munitions factories in the Free State in consultation with our experts.5. So far as they go, there would clearly be distinct advantages for us in such arrangements. There would seem to be certain military advantages, though as a layman I would not venture to assess them. On the political side co-operation in defence matters might well in time help in appeasement between the two* &quot; On more than one occasion Mr. de Valera has said that the Irish Government would not &apos; allow their country to be made the base of attack on Great Britain.   Any attempt to use our country for an attack on England would be resisted to the uttermost.&quot;   (Authorised statement by High Commissioner for Irish Free State at the meetings of Prime Ministers in May 1935.)&quot; It is quite obvious that the people in Britain .... would have to give us the assistance which we, for our. own sakes, would be anxious to call for, provided it was clear that the whole object of it was to maintain the inviolability of our territory.&quot; (Mr. de Valera in the Dail, May 19, 1937.)[16335] c 2
countries. From the financial point of view, the Exchequer would be relieved of certain liabilities. At the present time the annual cost of the maintenance of the defended ports is  162,000, but the proposals submitted for the modernisation of the equipment at those ports involve capital expenditure of some  747,000 and thereafter annual maintenance charges of  230,000. The requirements at these ports were recently reviewed; they are placed in Category A in order of importance. (C.I.D. paper 266A, pages 23 to 26.) Some financial and economic advantages would also be derived from the proposals set out under (iv) and (v) above.6. Nevertheless, we could not get such an arrangement unless we were agreeable to abandoning our occupation of the reserved ports without receiving any assurance from the Free State Government that those ports would be available to us in time of war. Our ability to use the ports in an emergency may be a matter of such vital importance that we should maintain our existing rights and  orgo the kind of agreement sketched above. In this connection I would draw my colleagues&apos; attention to what Mr. de Valera said to me on this aspect of the matter. As reported in my paper (CP. 228 (37)), he stated the issue as follows : &quot; If we (the United Kingdom) stayed in the ports, our occupation of them would remain a point of serious friction between the people of the Irish Free State and the people of Britain. The Irish regarded our occupation as an infringement of their national sovereignty. If in those circumstances we were to become engaged in war, he was afraid that feeling in Ireland would be so strong that there would be land attacks on the ports by irresponsible but considerable Irish forces. We would, of course, have to defend them against those attacks. Military action between our forces and Irish forces on Irish soil would arouse further the hostility of the Irish people. Any possibility of their coming into the war on our side would be at least gravely prejudiced. We might find that we were involved in the reconquest of Ireland. On the other hand, if we did not remain in the ports, that extremely unpleasant possibility would not arise. A sore point with the Irish would have been removed. The result would be a tendency to much better feeling on the part of the Irish towards Britain. There was much more likelihood then that if war came the Irish would come in on our side, and much more likelihood of our being invited to use the ports in the common defence of our two countries.&quot;7. Obviously there is a wide diffesence between an assurance that no enemy should use the ports, and an assurance that we should have the use of them for any purpose we like. I suggest that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should be asked to review the position in the light of my talks with Mr. de Valera and advise whether, from the military point of view, the retention of our existing rights in the reserved ports is so important that it outweighs the advantages to be gained from the kind of defence agreement outlined above. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would no doubt consider precisely what use we should wish to make of the ports in the event of war, and advise as to the importance to be attached thereto.8. If the Chiefs of Staff advise that we should maintain our existing rights in the ports, a new defence agreement with the Irish Free State Government is clearly out of the question. In that case I think that any chance of getting Mr. de Valera to reach a reasonable settlement on the financial and trade disputes also disappears. But if the Chiefs of Staff advise that in all the circumstances we should be prepared to take the risk involved in withdrawing from the ports, then I think that there is also some possibility of agreements on these other matters.Recommendation.9.   I therefore propose that:  (a) The Chiefs of Staff should be invited to advise on the question set out inparagraph 7 above.(b) If they answer that question in the negative, we should as a part of our general offer to the Irish Free State Government indicate that we should be prepared to withdraw from the ports on condition that we secured the points mentioned in paragraph 4 above (and any other points that the Chiefs of Stall advised to be necessary).
Financial Dispute.10. The annual payments to the United Kingdom Government agreed upon in the 1923 and 1926 Settlements with the then Government of the Irish Free State and now in default by the present Irish Free State Government, amount to approximately  4-7 millions per annum, composed as follows : Land purchase annuities :  3-1 millions. R.I.C. Judicial and Civil Pensions :  1 million. Local Loans :  0-6 million.Administrative and other minor expenditure :  13,000.This statement does not include the annual payment of  250,000 in respect of compensation for damage to property, payable by the Irish Free State under an Agreement of 1925, since this Agreement received what Mr. de Valera considers proper ratification by the Dail, and there has been no default in the payment. The following paragraphs are drawn up on the assumption that this payment will continue.11. As regards the land annuities, I fear that we must recognise that there is no prospect whatever of persuading Mr. de Valera to agree to any payment on this head as part of an agreed settlement; he has &quot; burned his boats &quot; in public too completely to allow him to agree to any compromise. Moreover, it seems extremely doubtful whether any likely alternative Government in the Irish Free State would now adopt any different attitude to that taken up by him. The Labour leaders support him wholeheartedly in his refusal to consider paying us any penny of land annuities, and even Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s supporters are inclined to adopt the line that, although the Annuities were properly paid under the old Financial Agreements, circumstances have so changed that these payments should be omitted from any settlement of the present dispute. It must be remembered that Mr. de Valera&apos;s Government has actually relieved landholders of 50 per cent, of their Annuity payments.12. It appears, however, not completely impossible that Mr. de Valera would be prepared to accept some responsibility in relation to the remaining items, totalling about  1-6 millions per annum. As regards those items involving payments to individuals, he might be prepared to undertake responsibility for the payment to the individuals concerned of the amount due to persons resident in the Free State, which would amount to about  790,000 per annum. As regards the other items, i.e., the local loan payments, payments to individuals outside the Free State and the various miscellaneous charges, he might agree to settle by means of a lump sum payment to cover all these items, viz.,  10-70 millions in respect of items now in default. There is, however, some doubt as to the ability of the Irish Free State to make a very substantial lump sum payment. In this connection attention may be drawn to the memorandum which I circulated to the Committee last year as I.S.C. (32) 113. In that memorandum, in discussing the possibility of a general settlement on the basis of a lump sum payment by the Irish Free State, it was stated that, &quot; if the Treasury had to make a guess as to how much the Irish Free State could borrow, they would not be prepared to suggest a higher figure than ten millions.&quot;13. But it will be seen that arrangements on the lines set out in the preceding paragraph would only cover about one-quarter of the total annual payment due to us, and I have therefore been considering whether there is any alternative charge which we might ask the Free State Government to bear in place of the-  3-1 millions of land purchase annuities. The only promising-suggestion which has occurred to me is that the Free State Government should undertake responsibility for our payments to Great War Pensioners living in the Free State, which amounted in 1936-37* to  1,270,000 in benefits, plus an administrative cost in the Free State of some  35,000 per annum. The Committee will remember that Mr. de Valera and I had some discussion on this in our recent talks. Although the present annual payment is considerable, this charge is, of course, a decreasing one; its capital equivalent is very much less than that of the land annuities, being only approximately  17,000,000; I understand that it will* I understand that the estimate for the current financial year is  1,150,000.
take another thirty-five years or so for the payments to be completely liquidated. It is true that under the Agreement of 1925 (which was ratified by both Parliaments and is therefore accepted by Mr. de Valera as binding) the Pree State Government were formally released from their contingent liability under Article 5 of the 1921 Treaty to pay the cost of War Pensions; but if an agreement is now to be negotiated on new bases, there seems no reason why we should not put forward this proposal without prejudicing the annual payment, referred to in paragraph 10 above, of  250,000 from the Irish Free State in respect of compensation for damage to property. It should be added that, for political and other reasons, it would clearly be impossible for the United Kingdom Govern-ment to divest themselves wholly of their responsibility for the payment of pensions, &amp;c, to ex-Service men in the Irish Free State under existing United Kingdom legislation. Moreover, it would probably be objectionable, on adminis-trative as well as political grounds, if the actual administration of the pensions were transferred to a department of the Free State Government. In the circumstances, the scheme which might be contemplated would be that the existing administrative system should be maintained, i.e., that there should continue to be a Pensions Office in Dublin which, under the general directions of the Ministry of Pensions in London, would be responsible for payments to pensioners in the Free State area. This Office would, however, receive its funds from the Free State Government and could perhaps be regarded in making payments as the agent of the Free State Government.14. As regards the financial aspects of defence, it will be noted that the suggestions which I have set out above would mean the transfer to the Irish Free State Government of certain existing and contingent financial burdens which are at present the liability of the United Kingdom Exchequer, amounting to a proposed capital expenditure of some  747,000 and thereafter annual main-tenance charges, amounting to some  230,000.15. As a matter of tactics it might be wise to start with an offer somewhat less generous than that outlined in the above paragraphs. We might therefore include in our proposals some additional item which we would be ready to drop, in the course of negotiations, as a concession in the interests of agreement. This item might be found in the Special Duties which we now levy on Irish Free State imports with a view to recouping the money which is being withheld from us. These duties, which are referred to in paragraph 20 below, bring in a sum of approximately  4-1 millions a year. Since the financial proposals made in the preceding paragraphs (even if Mr. de Valera is prepare ^ed to accept them all) involve our giving up about half of our claims, if measured by their capital equivalent, or approximately  1-53 million a year, measured in immediate annual income, I would suggest that we should not, in the first instance, express ourselves as prepared to abolish the Special Duties completely in return for the new financial arrangement. We might offer only to reduce the duties, and to a level which would bring us in, say, one-half of the annual sum which we are forgoing. But I am certain that any chance that there may be of an agreement would completely disappear if we were to insist on this, and suggest it deliberately as an item to be given up in the course of negotiations.16. I am bound to say that I think it is extremely doubtful whether Mr. de Valera would be prepared to accept all the liabilities proposed, even if we with-draw the suggested retention of part of the Special Duties. But rightly or wrongly, I thought that I detected in him, during our last talk, a greater realisation than he would then admit that he must come some way to meet us in settling the financial dispute. Much would depend on how tempting we could make an offer of a trade agreement (which would relieve his Government and people of considerable existing financial burdens, and help him to solve some pressing economic^ and. social problems) and a defence agreement (which he personally greatly desires, partly for Irish Nationalist reasons, but chiefly owing to the dangers of the present international situation). I am inclined to think that some at least of his colleagues would use their influence (for what it is worth) on him in favour of an agreement on the general lines suggested in this paper. It is true that even if he were prepared to concede all the points contained in the following paragraph we should be making a considerable surrender of our
financial claims, but it seems to me that some compromise of this nature would be justified if we could get advantageous agreements on other matters and secure some prospect of improved Anglo-Irish relations. In fact, we would be pressed to making some further financial concessions in the course of negotiations; whether or not we felt able to. consider this would depend on how the other departments of the negotiation were proceeding, and what price we were willing to pay for a settlement of the three questions with which this paper deals.Recommendation.17. On the assumption that the Chiefs of Staff offer advice on the question set out in paragraph 7 which enables us to decide to make general proposals to Mr. de Valera, I would propose : (a) that we should offer to conclude a new Financial Agreement in which (i) we should abandon our claim to Land Annuities payments;(ii) the Irish Free State would pay (a) R.I.C. judicial and civil pensions;(b) payments on account of local loans;(c) pensions payable to ex-servicemen in the Irish Free Stateand administrative charges in connection therewith;(d) administrative expenditure connected with (a) and other minor expenditure (see paragraph 10) in addition to(e) payments  now being made  on account  of  damage  to property in the Irish Free State;(iii) as regards the R.I.C. Pensions payable in the United Kingdom and items (&amp;) and (d) above, we should accept a lump sum settlement if that would be practicable for and more convenient to the Irish Free State than annual payments.(6) That, solely as a bargaining counter, we should not offer, in the first instance, to abolish our Special Duties entirely, but that we should express our willingness to reduce them to a level which would bring in, say, half of the annual sum which we are forgoing.18. In addition, under the defence agreement, the Irish Free State Govern-ment would be asked to bear the cost of the re-equipment and annual maintenance of the treaty ports.19. The financial effect of the various suggestions in (a) (i), (ii) and (iii) in paragraph 17 above is summarised in the Appendix to this Paper.Trade.20. The present position regarding trade is that a tariff war is being waged between the two countries, mitigated only by the &quot; coal-cattle &quot; pacts which are negotiated yearly. We maintain special duties against various Irish Free State imports which bring in a sum of approximately  4 -1 millions a year, and also import duties under the Import Duties Acts on goods (in the case of the &quot; Ottawa &quot; Dominions, free of duty) which bring in, as regards goods from the Irish Free State, approximately  0-55 millions per annum. The total amount withheld by the Irish Free State is  4- 7 millions per annum, of which the amount which the Exchequer is bound to meet is  4 millions. The Irish Free State Government have retaliated with special discriminatory duties against various United Kingdom imports into their market.21. If we concluded a new Financial Agreement, it would follow that we should abolish (or reduce see paragraph 15 above) our special duties against Irish Free State imports on condition that the Irish Free State Government abolished their retaliatory duties. The way would then be clear for an endeavour to negotiate a general trade agreement on a basis of reciprocity.   The possibilities
of increasing our export trade under such an arrangement are suggested by the following considerations : (a) According to Irish Free State official statistics, the United Kingdom share of the total import trade of the Irish Free State in recent years was :  &apos;000.1930.      1931.     193S.      1933. 1934. 1935. 1936.Total imports into the IrishFree State     .........      56,77(3    50,461    42,574    35,789 39,122 37,348 39,913Of which from United Kingdom      45,432    40,772    32,629    25,032 26,090 27,046 21,254It must be borne in mind that since April 1935 all imports into the Free State have been recorded by countries of origin instead of by countries of consignment, so that the above figures for 1935 and&quot; 1936 afford no&apos;real basis for comparative purposes.(b) Whilst United Kingdom exports to the Free State are still hampered by the special discriminatory duties imposed by the Free State Government, the disadvantages resulting from these duties have been much reduced by the Coal-Cattle Arrangement of 1935, and its subsequent extensions of 1936 and 1937. The position now is that the Free State&apos;s Special Duties have been wholly removed from coal and sugar, and its subsidiary products, and that the duties have been reduced from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent, as regards the other commodities concerned, viz., cement, certain electrical goods, apparatus, certain spirits, certain kinds of machinery (excluding, inter alia, agricultural machinery), and certain iron and steel goods. Whilst separate figures showing imports of these goods from the United Kingdom in 1936 are not available, it may be presumed that the removal of the remaining 10 per cent, of Special Duties would assist the United Kingdom to recover much of the trade she has lost in these items.(c) As regards the possibilities of securing reductions of other Irish Free State customs duties, it appears doubtful whether any substantial change in favour of the United Kingdom can be secured in respect of those goods which are subject to protective duties imposed by the Free State Government in recent years for the encouragement of local industries. But in other cases tariff adjust-ments, including possibly the grant of preferential rates of duty, could probably be secured. In general, the United Kingdom would be given a greater opportunity of competing for a share of the Free State market at present supplied by foreign countries. Free State imports of foreign origin in 1936 were valued at  13,144,000.22. It must be borne in mind that one part of any general agreement would be a defence agreement with which was included an understanding that the Irish Free State Government would purchase most of their defence equipment in this country.23. A settlement of the tariff war would undoubtedly be welcome to Mr. de Valera, and indeed this is one of our strongest bargaining counters in dealing with him. Our special duties on Irish Free State imports are a heavy burden on their producers, and Mr. de Valera admitted to me that in addition they had cost his Government many millions of pounds, on account of compen-satory bounties to Irish producers, &amp;c.Recommendation.24. I therefore would propose that we should accompany our offer to him with a renewed assurance that if a settlement of the financial dispute is reached, we shall be ready to abolish (or reduce see paragraph 15 above) our special duties against Irish Free State imports on condition that his Government abolished the special discriminatory duties against United Kingdom imports, and to enter into negotiations for a general trade agreement in the nature of our Ottawa Agree-ments with the other Dominions.General.25. Needless to say, I do not regard a settlement on lines such as have been indicated above as in any way the ideal or final settlement of our relations with the Irish Free State. The only satisfactory final settlement would be one in which the Irish Free State Government accepted frankly, freely and ungrudgingly
loyalty to the King and full association with the British Commonwealth. Owing to the attitude of Mr. de Valera and the introduction of the new Constitution, I cannot see that any such settlement is possible for a.very long time to come, if indeed it can ever be achieved. But any substantial improvement in any depart-ment of relations between the two countries will not only prevent further estrange-ment and hostility, it will also positively help to bring about gradually that real friendship and co-operation which should be natural on account of the common interests of the two countries, and which I feel certain Mr. de Valera himself genuinely desires in principle.26. Admittedly there is another serious shortcoming in the proposals which I make. Though agreements on the financial dispute, trade and defence would seem likely to have some effect in improving relations between the two countries, they would do nothing, apparently, to mitigate the bitterness of Mr. de Valera&apos;s and many of his countrymen&apos;s feelings about partition. Throughout all my conversations with him during the last two years he has been at pains to emphasise his view that no final settlement of the relations between the two countries is possible whilst partition remains, and he has since reiterated this view in public at his annual party meeting. What is the use, it may be asked, of making agreements which do not touch the major cause of ill-feeling ? I can only answer for myself that I think agreements on the lines suggested in this memorandum would be of some help. With regard to partition it will be seen from my account of the conversations that I took the line that this was essentially a matter for settlement between the peoples of the two parts of the island and that it was for him and the people of the South, if they really wished to end partition, so to order their affairs that the people of the North would be willing to throw in their lot with them. At the same time I did not hide my feeling that there seems little prospect in any circumstances of partition coming to an end. It may be that gradually the people of Southern Ireland will realise all this, or it may be that time will bring changes which solve that problem. In the mean-time we must undoubtedly expect continual agitation from Mr. de Valera and his friends. But I think that under the surface a greater regard and friendship for Great Britain is very gradually growing in the Irish Free State; and agree-ments on defence, finance and trade would do something to stimulate their growth.Summary.27.   The following is a summary of my recommendations :   I. Defence.(1) That the Chiefs of Staff should be invited to review the position in the light of my talks with Mr. de Valera and to advise whether, from the military point of view, the retention of our existing rights in the reserved ports is so important that it outweighs the advantages to be gained from a defence agree-ment on the lines set out in (2) below.(2) That if the Chiefs of Staff answer the question in (1) in the negative, we should, as a part of a general offer to the Free State Government, indicate that we should be prepared to withdraw from the ports on condition that we secured a defence agreement under which the Free State Government would : (i) put into effect our military advisers&apos; proposals for bringing the defences both of the reserved ports and of the whole coast of the Free State up to a proper standard of equipment and efficiency; thereafter maintain the defences at that level; and provide some small naval vessels and aeroplanes for coastal defence purposes; (ii) increase considerably the personnel of their defence forces generally;(iii) co-operate closely with us in defence matters, maintaining contact with us in the development of their defence plans and inviting the advice of our experts in the organisation of their defence forces and equipment;(iv) purchase defence equipment, both for the defended ports and for their forces generally, from the United Kingdom in all cases where it could not be locally manufactured in the Free State; (v) arrange for the erection and operation of one or more munitions factories in the Free State in consultation with our experts, (vi) take such other defence action as the Chiefs of Staff in their report may advise to be necessary. T16335] d
II. Financial.(3) That, on the assumption that the Chiefs of Staff offer advice on the point set out at (I) above which enables us to decide to make general proposals to the Free State Government (a) we should offer to conclude a new Financial Agreement in which : (i) we should abandon our claim to Land Annuities payments; (ii) the Irish Free State would pay (a) R.I.C. judicial and civil pensions;(b) payments on account of local loans;(c) pensions payable to ex-servicemen in the Irish Free Stateand administrative charges in connection therewith;(d) administrative expenditure connected with (a) and other minor expenditure, in addition to(e) payments now being made on account of damage to property in the Irish Free State;(iii) that as regards the R.I.C. Pensions payable in the United Kingdom and items (b) and (d) above, we should accept a lump sum settlement if that would be practicable for and more convenient to the Irish Free State than annual payments.(The financial effect of these various suggestions is summarised in the Annex to this Paper.)(b) solely as a bargaining counter, we should not offer in the first instance,to abolish our special duties entirely, but should express our willing-ness to reduce them to a level which would bring in, say, half of the annual sum which we are forgoing.Ill- Trade.(4) That we should accompany our offer of financial agreement with a renewed assurance that if a settlement of the financial dispute is reached, we shall be ready to abolish (or reduce see (3) (b) above) our special duties against Free State imports on condition that the Free State Government abolishes the special discriminatory duties against United Kingdom imports, and to enter into negotiations for a general trade agreement in the nature of our Ottawa Agree-ments with the other Dominions.M.

SECRET. [I.S.C. (32) 124]CABINET.Irish Situation Committee.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE following developments have taken place in the situation in relation to the Irish Free State since the meeting of the Irish Situation Committee on the 11th March.The terms of a statement for communication to Mr. de Valera were then approved, subject to concurrence in it by the&apos;other Dominion Governments. As a result of communications which then took place with these Governments (the relevant telegrams were circulated to the Cabinet as they were despatched or received) some verbal alterations were made in the statement which was finally agreed as set forth in Annex I to this note.On the 3rd April I handed the statement to the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State for transmission to Mr. de Valera. At the same time I repeated to Mr. Dulanty our views on certain details of the Irish Free State legislation which had been discussed by the Irish Situation Committee, informing him again that two or three of the other Dominion Governments had also expressed concern regarding these points, and shared our views regarding them. I handed him a note on these points for transmission with the other document to Mr. de Valera. A copy of this note is appended to this memorandum (Annex II).Had Lord Craigavon been available, I would have shown him copies of both communications before I handed them to Mr. Dulanty. In his absence Sir Horace Wilson got into touch with Sir Charles Blackmore, Secretary of the Cabinet of Northern Ireland, and the latter agreed that the messages need not be held up pending Lord Craigavon&apos;s return from abroad, as Lord Craigavon had had an opportunity of discussing the matter with the Prime Minister in January, and had then agreed with the general line which we proposed to take. I was anxious that the documents should go as soon as possible to Dublin before Mr. de Valera completed the draft of his new Constitution Bill. When Lord Craigavon was passing through London on the 7th April, I showed him both documents. Apart from regretting that we had included the paragraph expressing a desire to co-operate with the Irish Free State Government (which, in his view, would merely be taken by the Irish Free State authorities as indicative that we were ready to make further concessions), he seemed to be satisfied with their terms.Mr. Dulanty, after a considerable interval, handed to me on the 27th April the reply of the Irish Free State Government to our statement. A copy of this reply is attached as Annex III] In some respects this is not a satisfactory document, but I need not discuss it in detail now, since, in the meantime, the new draft Constitution of &apos;&apos; Eire &apos;&apos; has been published.The position resulting will, I fear, force us to consider very carefully again the whole of our attitude towards the Irish Free State. I have had some preliminary talk with the Attorney-General about the issues involved, and propose to circulate a further memorandum covering each aspect of the problem as soon as possible. I think that we should aim at reaching our own conclusions on the matter in time for informal discussions on the situation to take place with the Dominion Prime Ministers before they leave London.On the 6th May Mr. Dulanty informed me that the Irish Free State Government had decided not to participate in the Imperial Conference.M. M.May 7, 1937.APPENDIX IV.
THE United Kingdom Government have considered very carefully the recent constitutional legislation of the Irish Free State from the point of view of its possible effect on the relationship of the Irish Free State to the British Common-wealth of Nations.In the United Kingdom Governments view this legislation involves a departure from the provisions of the Articles of Agreement of the 6th December, 1921, and in their opinion, therefore, the changes should properly have been the subject of prior consultation. They regret the disappearance as regards the internal affairs of the Irish Free State of constitutional forms in relation to The King which are in use by the other Members of the Commonwealth. At the same time, they understand the position to be as follows : (i) The Irish Free State desires to remain a co-equal Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations;(ii) The Crown remains the symbol of the association of the Members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations;(iii) The King&apos;s Title remains unaffected by the legislation.   It is as King ofGreat Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas that he continues as heretofore to exercise his functions in regard to the external affairs of the Irish Free State.On this basis, the United Kingdom Government have reached the conclusion that they are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth.The United Kingdom Government hope that there may be a fuller development of co-operation in all matters of common concern between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom. They, for their part, believe such co-operation to be in the mutual interest of both peoples.The Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa also are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth. The text of this statement has been communicated to the above-mentioned Governments.Annex II.There are certain points of detail in connection with the Irish Free State constitutional legislation to which the United Kingdom desire to draw special attention, as follows : (a) It is understood that the Irish Free State Government have in contemplation the possibility of omitting from their new constitution the clause which now appears as Article 1 of the Constitution of 1922. It appears to the United Kingdom Government that it is of great importance that this clause, or its equivalent, should be retained either in the new constitution or in the External Relations Act. They feel that without an explicit statement in legislation of this kind the position of the Irish Free State might be obscure and embarrassment might result.(&amp;) In Section 3 (1) of the Irish Free State Executive Authority (External Relations) Act of 1936, it is thought that the words &quot; symbol of their co-operation &quot; might be read to mean that while The King is recognised as the symbol of co-operation between the other members of the Commonwealth, he is not recognised by the Irish Free State as a symbol of its co-operation also. It is suggested that it is desirable to make it clear that the Irish Free State do recognise The King as a symbol of their co-operation with the other members of the Commonwealth.(c) In the amendment made by the recent Constitution Amendment Act to Article 51 of the Irish Free State Constitution, it is suggested that the use of annex I.
the word &quot; organ &quot; to describe the King is unfortunate, especially as this Article forms the only link between the Constitution and the External Relations Act. It is suggested that in order to make the position clear, it would seem desirable that the Article should be re-worded so as to make specific reference to The King.It is hoped that the Irish Free State Government will in their new constitutional legislation be able to make such modifications as may be required in order to meet the three points set out above, particularly that under (a).Annex III.THE Government of Saorstat Eireann (to be known after the passing of the Constitution as &quot; Eire &quot;) have received the Note handed by Mr. MacDonald to Mr. Dulanty on the 3rd April, setting forth the attitude of the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand on the recent Constitutional legislation of Saorstat Eireann. The Government of Saorstat Eireann note that the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. They note further that the United Kingdom Government, in reaching the same conclusion, have formulated three propositions. The Government of Saorstat Eireann do not wish to enter into a. controversy as to the precise meaning and implications of these propositions. They would like to point out, however, that the acceptance of (ii) and (iii) as they stand would seem to imply that in certain vital aspects of their Constitutional development no further evolution of the individual States of the Commonwealth is possible.2. With regard to the first proposition, it would be impossible for any Govern-ment in Saorstat Eireann to express an unqualified desire to remain a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations whilst Ireland remains a partitioned nation. On the other hand, the Government of Saorstat Eireann would regard the removal of the inequalities of the Treaty position and the acceptance of the association of Saorstat Eireann with the Commonwealth in a manner consistent with Ireland&apos;s history and aspirations as definite steps towards the desired unity and the establishment of friendly relations between Ireland and Great Britain.3. With regard to a departure from the provisions of the Articles of Agreement mentioned in paragraph 2 of the United Kingdom Governments Note, it need only be said that the evolution in the status of the Members of the Commonwealth, which has taken place since the Articles of Agreement were signed, has created an entirely new situation; these Articles of Agreement have been gradually replaced by legislation in the Irish Parliament based on declared principles of co-equality. It is on the basis of these principles also that the new Constitution about to be presented to the people has been drawn up. The Articles of Agreement postulated control of the Irish Parliament by the British Parlia-ment. Until that situation was ended no approach to a final settlement between the peoples of the two countries could be made.4. The Government of Saorstat Eireann fully endorse the hope expressed by the United Kingdom Government that there may be a fuller development of co-operation in all matters of common concern between them, and they share the belief that such co-operation would be in the mutual interests of both peoples.Department of External Affairs, Dublin.
APPENDIX V.SECRET.[I.S.C. (32) 125]CABINET.Irish Situation Committee.RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.RECENT events concerning relations with the Irish Free State require very careful consideration. I will set them forth in order. This memorandum confines itself to describing the new facts which make further consideration of the position necessary. I shall be prepared at the meeting of the Committee to offer suggestions as to the policy that we should adopt in the face of them. This memorandum contains many references to the Annexes to my Paper I.S.C. (32) 124, which should be read in conjunction with it.I.Irish Legislation at the time of the A bdication.2. Following consultation with the other Dominion Governments, we sent Mr. de Valera a document concerning the Irish Free State legislation at the time of the Abdication (Annex I, I.S.C. (32) 124) saying that we understood &quot;the position to be as follows : (i) The Irish Free State desires to remain a co-equal Member of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations, (ii) The Crown remains the symbol of the association of the Members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, (iii) The King&apos;s title remains unaffected by the legislation.   It is as King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas that he continues as heretofore to exercise his functions in regard to the external affairs of the Irish Free State.On this basis the United Kingdom Government have reached the conclusion that they are prepared to treat the Irish Free State legislation in question as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth.&quot;3. The other Dominion Governments, though they did not all associate themselves in terms with the &apos;&apos; basis &apos;&apos; as set out above, agreed with the conclusion which we reached.4. At the same time we repeated to Mr. de Valera certain points of detail regarding his legislation to which we attached special importance. They are contained in the document printed as Annex II to I.S.C. (32) 124, and I shall return to these points when examining the present Irish Free State Constitutional Bill in Section II of this Memorandum.5. To these communications the Irish Free State Government sent a reply (Annex III to I.S.C. (32) 124), in which, inter alia, our propositions (i), (ii) and (iii) above are dealt with. With regard to (i), it states that &quot; it would be impossible for any Government in Saorstat Eireann to express an unqualified desire to remain a Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations whilst Ireland remains a partitioned nation. On the other hand, the Government of Saorstat Eireann would regard the removal of the inequalities of the Treaty
position and the acceptance of the association of Saorstat Eireann with the Commonwealth in a manner consistent with Ireland&apos;s history and aspirations as definite steps towards the desired unity and the establishment of friendly relations between Ireland and Great Britain.&quot;6. The reply speaks of inability &quot; to express an unqualified desire.&quot; This presumably implies that the Irish Free State does in some sense &quot;desire&quot; to remain a member of the Commonwealth. I do not know what is the sum total of the iniquities which Mr. de Valera has in mind when he refers to &apos;&apos; the inequalities of the Treaty position,&quot; but I think the most important of them is our occupation of certain Irish Free State ports. He knows that we have offered to end this occupation on certain conditions, the principal one being that we are assured of the use of these ports in time of war. . I presume that by &apos;&apos; acceptance of the association of Saorstat Eireann with the Commonwealth in a manner consistent with Ireland&apos;s history and aspirations,&quot; Mr. de Valera means agree-ment by us that his latest constitutional proposals do not make any difference to the Free State&apos;s membership of the Commonwealth.7. With regard to (ii) and (iii), the reply says: &quot;The Government of Saorstat Eireann do not wish to enter into a controversy as to the precise meaning and implications of these propositions. They would like to point out, however, that the acceptance of (ii) and (iii) as they stand would seem to imply that in certain vital aspects of their Constitutional development, no further evolution of the individual states of the Commonwealth is possible.&quot;8. These are unsatisfactory words, but do not of themselves, I think, create insuperable difficulties. In the first place, controversy with Mr. de Valera as to the &quot; precise meaning and implications &quot; of the proposition that the King is King of Ireland would no doubt lead to hair-splitting arguments on the subject of allegiance. It seems to me that we need not enter into such controversy; we could be content to maintain our own view regarding the duty owed by a citizen of a country to that country&apos;s King, provided that the King is recognised. Perhaps the way to state the position as to allegiance might be this. The King-has been King of Ireland since the reign of Henry VIII; Ireland is part of the King&apos;s dominions and persons born in Ireland are therefore born within the King&apos;s dominions and allegiance. That position cannot be altered without denying that the King is King of Ireland, which Mr. de Valera does not deny. When, in 1934, Mr. de Valera purported by legislation to deprive Irish Free State citizens of their status as British subjects, we, on the advice of Sir Thomas Inskip, then Attorney-General, said that his legislation was inoperative for the purpose.9. Mr. de Valera&apos;s next comment is that acceptance of (ii) and (iii) as expressed in our statement would seem to imply that in regard to the matters there dealt with no further evolution of the constitutional development of an individual State belonging to the Commonwealth is possible. He is, of course, anxious to maintain his contention that it would be possible for the Irish Free State, or the whole of Ireland, to become a complete and avowed Republic, and yet to remain in the Commonwealth, reaping all the benefits of membership. Though we should take a different view, we were not, when framing our statement, considering at all the question of possible future evolution; we were seeking to discover and establish the facts of the existing situation as left by the Abdication legislation; and in spite of his comments and qualifications, it would seem from his reply that Mr. de Valera does agree that propositions (i), (ii) and (iii) do in fact describe the situation as it is to-day. We presumably meant that so long as that situation lasted we could feel justified in treating the Abdication legis-lation as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of the Irish Free State as a Member of the British Commonwealth. In replying to Mr. de Valera we could, if necessary, state our view that propositions (ii) and (iii) were of permanent importance; but we need not seek to commit him here and now to that view.10. It seems to me, therefore, that, had no further developments taken place, it would have been possible to send&apos; a reply to Mr. de Valera&apos;s message stating in effect that what our previous document ha&quot;d sought to establish was the present situation without prejudice to anyone&apos;s opinions as to the future; and that, as we understood from his message that the existing situation was as stated in (i), (ii) and (iii), our conclusion held good.
II.The New Constitution Bill.11. But within a few days of receiving the Irish Free State Governments reply the situation was further complicated by the publication of their latest Constitution Bill (Annex IV to I.S.C. (32) 124). This is the Bill which Mr. de Valera originally foreshadowed in his message to the King almost exactly a year ago, which has been in preparation ever since, and the place of which was taken temporarily in the emergency last December by the first of the Acts passed by the Dail at the time.12. The first comment that I would offer is that in the new Bill Mr. de Valera has ignored completely the three points of detail to which we drew special attention in the second note which we recently sent him (Annex II, I.S.C. (32) 124). It will be remembered that I first raised these points in my conversations with him in January, and have repeated them on a number of occasions in subsequent talks with Mr. Dulanty. We attached particular importance to the first point, i.e., the retention of Article I of the existing Constitution (which declares that the Irish Free State &quot; is a co-equal member of the Community of Nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations &quot;) in the new Constitution. Several times Mr. Dulanty told me that he thought that as a result of our suggestion Mr. de Valera would retain this Article in some form, and that I would be shown the proposed clause informally before it was printed, in order that Mr. de Valera would be aware of any comments that I wished to make upon it. Nevertheless, no such clause appears, and Mr. Dulanty gave me no warning that it had been finally decided to omit it. My colleagues will see in Section II, sub-section (i), of my account of my last conversations with Mr. de Valera (CP. 14 (37)) the reasons which he then gave for doubting whether he could accept our three suggestions, and it may be that these are the reasons why he has eventually ignored them.13. The new Constitution of the Irish Free State, or Eire (which is, I understand, the Gaelic word for Ireland), as it is to be styled on the coming into force of the Constitution, covers a wide field. Its main features requiring examination from the point of view of the Free State&apos;s relations with this country are as follows : (1) The national territory consists of the whole of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas (Article 2), though &quot; pending the reintegration of the-national territory and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory, the laws enacted by that Parliament shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstat Eireann and the like extra-territorial effect &quot; (Article 3).(2) Eire is a sovereign, independent, democratic state (Article 5).(3) All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people (Article 6).(4) There is to be an elected President who must be a citizen of Eire and who is to &quot; take precedence over all other persons in the State &quot; (Article 12).(5) The President is to appoint a Prime Minister, on the nomination of the Dail, and the other members of the Government on the nomination of the Prime Minister with the previous approval of the Dail (Article 13 (1)).(6) The President is to summon and dissolve the Dail on the advice of the Prime Minister (Article 13 (2)).(7) The supreme command of the Defence Forces is vested in the President and all commissioned officers of the Defence Forces will hold their commissions from him (Article 13 (4) and (5)). No military or armed force other than a force raised and maintained by the Parliament shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever (Article 15 (6) (2)).(8) The right of pardon is vested&quot; in the President (Article 13 (6)).(9) Parliament will consist of the President and two Houses (Article 15), and legislation passed by the two Houses will require the signature of the President for its enactment (Article 13 (3)).(10) Judges are to be appointed by the President (Article 35).[16335] e
(11) There is no mention in the Constitution of the King or the British Commonwealth of Nations, but Article 29 (4) provides that &quot; The executive power of Eire in or in connection with its external relations shall, in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of Eire in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument, or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which Eire is or becomes associated for the purpose of international co-operation in matters of common concern.&quot; The equivalent section in the existing Constitution, as amended at the time of the Abdication, is contained in a proviso which reads as follows : &quot; Provided that it shall be lawful for the Executive Council, to the extent and subject to any conditions which may be determined by law to avail, for the purposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular agents, and the conclusion of international agreements of any organ used as a constitutional organ for the like purposes by any of the nations referred to in Article I of this Constitution&quot; (i.e., the Article which says that the Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, which is omitted from the new Constitution).14 This Constitution Bill is now being debated in the Dail, and, if it passes the Dail, will be submitted to the people of the Irish Free State for their approval, probably at the time of the General Election which is expected sometime later this year. It will not come into effect until it has received this popular approval, when it will take the place of the temporary Act, passed at the time of the Abdication, which deprived the King and his representative of all functions in the internal affairs of the Free State, and divided the exercise of those functions between the Speaker of the Dail and the President of the Executive Council.15. I should add that a further Bill has recently been introduced in the Dail entitled the &quot; Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Bill, 1937,&quot; which is apparently intended to come into force before the new Constitution. Its main objects are to complete the work of removing the King and the Governor-General from the internal Constitution, and to give a pension to Mr. Buckley (the former Governor-General). The important clause is clause 2 (1), which pi&apos;ovides that every power, function, &amp;c, required to be performed by the King or the Flepresentative of the Crown is transferred to the Executive Council except in cases where such power, function, &amp;c, is under the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, &quot; conferred or imposed on some other person.&quot;III.The External Relations Act.16. The new Constitution when passed will not stand alone, nor contain the whole of the law concerning the exercise of the functions of government in the Irish Free State. At the time of the Abdication a second Act was passed, the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act referred to above. During my conversations with him shortly afterwards, Mr. de Valera explained that he intended this Act to remain permanently on the Statute Book, to be read in conjunction with the proposed new Constitution Act, and be a partner to it. This is the law referred to in Article 29 (4) of the new Constitution. Mr. de Valera added that he proposed to give this External Relations Act a status equal with the Constitution Act by providing that the same special, complicated procedure (involving, after the first three years, a referendum) which is necessary to amend the latter Act shall also be required before amendment of the former Act is possible. I presume that this is still his intention, and have asked Mr. Dulanty to find out whether this is so.17.   Clause 3 of the External Relations Act reads : -3. ,(1) It is hereby declared and enacted that, so long as Saorstat Eireann is associated with the following nations, that is to say, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and South Africa, and so long as the King recognised by those nations as the symbol of their co-operation continues
to act on behalf of each of those nations (on the advice of the several Govern-ments thereof) for the purposes of the appointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements, the King so recognised may, and is hereby authorised to, act on behalf of Saorstat Eireann for the like purposes as and when advised by the Executive Council so to do.(2) Immediately upon the passing of this Act the Instrument of Abdication executed by His Majesty King Edward VIII .... shall have effect . . . . , and His said Majesty shall for the purposes of the foregoing Sub-section of this Section and all other, if any, purposes cease to be King, and the King for those purposes shall henceforth be the person who, if His said Majesty had died on the 10th December, 1936, unmarried, would for the time being be his successor under the law of Saorstat Eireann.IV.Other Recent Developments.18. A few other developments should be recorded to complete the present picture. Some time after the message referred to in Section I of this memorandum had been sent to Mr. de Valera, and before his reply had been received, our officials met Mr. Dulanty to resume their informal exploration of other questions outstanding between the two countries. On defence questions no progress was made. Mr. Dulanty said that it would be politically inexpedient for Mr. de Valera to give us an assurance that we could use the Treaty ports in time of war, even though he believed that in fact those ports would be at our service. But Mr. Dulanty said that he thought it would be possible to discover a formula about our using the ports when the interests of the two countries were vitally involved, which he hoped would be satisfactory to us. He promised to produce such a formula, but has not yet done so. I cannot say that I share his optimism at the prospects, though it is just possible that a recent statement in the Dail by Mr. de Valera to the effect that while assistance from the United Kingdom would be welcomed in maintaining the freedom of the Irish Free State from foreign invasion, it would be on condition that that was the sole purpose of such assistance, was a slight move on his part towards a less uncompromising attitude.19. On the question of the financial difficulty, an Irish representative for the first time showed a disposition to move from the position which Mr. de Valera has hitherto adopted of refusing to pay a penny of the monies in dispute, Mr. Dulanty told me in a talk on the 30th April (speaking on much the same lines as he had adopted in his talk with our officials) that in his personal opinion Mr. de Valera would be willing not only to relieve us of all the expenditure necessary in putting the port and coast defences of the Irish Free State into an adequate state of efficiency, but also to pay the pensions and other monies in dispute so far as they were owing to individuals or authorities in the Free State, if we were willing to make the payments to those in the United Kingdom. But Mr. Dulanty is not always a reliable guide to his master&apos;s mind, and too much importance should not at present be attached to this statement. It may not be irrelevant, however, to observe that in a recent statement in the Dail Mr. de Valera emphasised the refusal of the Irish Free State to pay the land annuities, but made no mention whatever of the other financial items in dispute (R.I.C. pensions, &amp;c). The conversations between our officials and Mr. Dulanty have in the meantime been suspended.20. The Irish Free State Government sent no special representative tO&apos; Their Majesties&apos; Coronation, but Mr. Dulanty attended as High Commissioner (as the result, I understand, of much pressure by himself on Mr. de Valera). Pie has similarly attended many of the functions held in connection with the Coronation. On the other hand, when he was invited to be present at two purely Empire gatherings at the Palace the presentation of addresses to Their Majesties by overseas governments, and the Luncheon which followed this ceremony he refused, on instructions from Mr. de Valera.21. After long hesitation the Free State Government decided not to participate in the Imperial Conference. Mr. Dulanty tells me that he thinks the reason is that attendance at an Imperial Conference just before a crucial General Election would prove embarrassing to Mr. de Valera.   This may have[16335] e 2
something to do with the decision. Mr. de Valera&apos;s own explanation in the Dail was that the Irish Free State representatives had been put in a humiliating position at the Ottawa Conference because the United Kingdom delegation treated them as people whose word could not be trusted, and that he would not take the risk of putting Free State delegates in such a position at the present Conference. He knows well that Irish Free State representatives at the present Conference would have been treated as equals with the other representatives. I cannot help feeling that the major consideration weighing in his mind is that a great many of the Coronation functions- such as the Guildhall Luncheon and the Naval Review were being held during the period of the Conference, and that attendance at these would embarrass him in his Election, whilst a refusal to attend would be openly discourteous to the King.V.The Problem.22. The question that we have to answer is whether in our view the new Constitution of the Irish Free State (or Eire) is compatible with what we had in mind when we laid down the three propositions which formed the basis of our conclusion that we were prepared to treat the last Irish Free State legislation as not effecting a fundamental alteration in the position of that country as a Member of the British Commonwealth. We are not alone concerned with this question. Before reaching any final conclusion we shall have to ascertain the views of the other Dominion Governments, and it is fortunate that their Prime Ministers are gathered in London just now. We should endeavour to reach some understanding with them on this problem whilst they are here. But first we must consider what is our own view on the situation.23.   On the one side there are the following considerations : (i) Mr. de Valera would almost certainly say that our three propositions quoted in Section I of this memorandum will be as applicable to the situation after the passing of the new Constitution as they are to-day.(ii) Mr. de Valera acquiesced in the Oath administered to the King in the Coronation, which read &quot; Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia . . . .&quot; The King was, in fact, crowned as King of Ireland as well as of the other parts of the Empire. When Mr. de Valera said that the Irish Free State Government&apos;s attitude to the Coronation must be one of &quot; detachment and protest &quot; the grounds which he gave for this were not that the King was being crowned as King of Ireland, or that he was taking an oath to govern the people of Ireland, but that Ireland was still partitioned and that the Coronation service discriminated against the Roman Catholic religion.The fact that His Majesty was crowned as King of Ireland is well under-stood in the Free State, and has led some irate Republicans to blow up King George II&apos;s equestrian statue in Dublin.(iii) The Irish Free State Government are continuing to send documents regarding external affairs (such as exequaturs for the recognition of foreign consuls) to His Majesty for his signature exactly as heretofore. I understand that these documents declare that His Majesty signs them as &quot; King of Great Britain, Ireland, and the British Dominions beyond the Seas, &amp;c.&quot; No change is contemplated so far as I know in the form of Irish Free State pass-ports, which are still being issued in the name of the King.(iv) A few days ago the Irish Free State Government became a party to the Egyptian Capitulations Treaty recently signed at Montreux. The Free State delegate to the Conference received his full powers from the King; in the Treaty it. is written that the King had appointed Mr. Cremins as his plenipotentiary for the Irish Free State (the Irish Free State plenipotentiary being grouped with those of other Members of the British Commonwealth);-His Majesty is described in the text of the Treaty as King of Great Britain, IrelancL &amp;c.; and the Irish Free State representative signed his name amongst the group of signatures of those signing for the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. This happens to be the first such instrument that the Irish Free State has signed since Mr. de Valera came into office, and indeed since the London Naval Treaty of 1930. Presumably, the same procedure will still be followed after the passage of the new Constitution.
(v) The fact is that the King&apos;s powers regarding the external affairs of the Irish Free State remain unimpaired. It is interesting to note that the clause in the new Constitution dealing with the declaration of war merely says : &quot; War shall not be declared and Eire shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dail Eireann &quot; (Article 28 (3)). It does not say that the President shall declare war, though the Constitution is careful to define his powers and functions. In the light of my last conversation with Mr. de Valera, when we discussed this point, I think he has come to the conclusion that it is for the King to declare war (with the assent, of course, of the Dail) on behalf of the Irish Free State (or Eire).(vi) So far as the Constitution for internal affairs is concerned, though its form is that of a Republic, it is nowhere called a Republic. The relevant Article runs, &quot;Eire is a sovereign, independent, democratic State,&quot; and deliberately avoids the term Republic. Mr. de Valera promised his followers a Constitution Act which would not of itself require any alteration if the Irish Free State were to decide to become a Republic, and he has certainly produced a Bill to this effect. But he would deny that he is establishing a Republic.24. On the other hand, there are the following considerations to be taken into account : (i) The whole spirit of the proposed new Constitution for internal affairs is Republican. Its provisions are much more definite than those of the existing legislation in their elimination of the King from any part in the internal affairs of the Free State. The Abdication legislation deprived the King (or his repre-sentative) of his functions in the internal affairs of the State, but there were features in it which made it possible to argue that the office of King had not disappeared from the State. It would be more difficult to argue that now. For example : (a) The first Article of the existing Constitution declares that the Irish Free State is a co-equal member of the British Commonwealth of Nations; and the authoritative statement concerning the British Commonwealth the Declaration of 1926 says that all its members are &quot;united by a common allegiance to the Crown.&quot; It is possible to argue, by reference, therefore that the Irish Free State owes allegiance to the King. But this Article has been deliberately omitted from the new Constitution, and there is no mention of the British Commonwealth either in that Constitution or in the External Relations Act. All that the latter Act says is that &apos;&apos; so long as Saorstat Eireann is associated with the following nations, that is to say, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, New Zealand and South Africa,&quot; certain things may be done (Clause 3, quoted in paragraph above).(b) Under the existing Constitution as amended in December 1936, the President of the Executive Council is appointed by election in the Dail while other Ministers are appointed by him with the assent of the Dail. Judges are appointed by the Executive Council. There is no provision regarding officers of the defence forces, but under an Act of 1924 they are appointed by commissions from the Executive Council signed by the President of the Executive Council and the Minister of Defence as Commander-in-chief. The Speaker summons and dissolves the Dail, while the signature of the President of the Executive Council is all that is required to make Bills passed by the Dail into Statutes. In the new Constitution these various functions are performed by the President.With regard to these matters therefore the new Constitution does not take away from the King any functions performed by him. It does, however, emphasise the absence of the King by concentrating these functions in the hands of a single individual, i.e., the President. It will presumably be still more difficult, if not now wholly impossible, to speak of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers or His Majesty&apos;s judges, or His Majesty&apos;s officers and army in the Irish Free State.(c) In the new Constitution Article 39 defines treason as follows : &apos;&apos; Treason shall consist only in levying war against Eire or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against Eire, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means
to overthrow the organs of Government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.&apos;&apos;It should be noted that the word &apos;&apos; organ &apos;&apos; used in this Article is the same as one of the words used to describe the King in Article 29 quoted in paragraph 13 (11) above. It may be that the term has been used again deliberately in this Article regarding treason in order to include action against the King as treason. But it is at least doubtful whether the &apos;&apos; organ &apos;&apos; referred to in Article 29 could at least as a matter of strict construction be described as one of &quot; the organs of Government established by this Constitution.&quot; It is questionable, therefore, whether the new Constitution recognises action against the King as treason.(d) The new Constitution in Article 12 says that there shall be a President &quot; who shall take precedence- over all other persons in the State.&quot; This presumably means either that the King is not a &apos;&apos; person in the State,&apos;&apos; or that, if he is, the President wrould be entitled to take precedence over him. I would remind my colleagues that in I.S.C. (32) 100, dealing with the Constitutional issues involved, the following passage occurs in paragraph 11: &quot; We think that Mr. de Valera&apos;s constitutional ideas might usefully be tested by a hypothesis. Supposing that, after the new Constitution has been established, the King went to Dublin, would the King&apos;s position there, in Mr. de Valera&apos;s view, be that of a visiting Sovereign to be received with courtesy, but, apart from the politeness due to guests, having no status superior to the President ? Or would he enjoy the status there of the supreme head of the Commonwealth of which Ireland, equally with Canada, or the United Kingdom, forms a part 1&apos;&apos;It would appear that these questions receive their answer in the new Constitution, and that under it the King in Dublin would at the best have only a courtesy precedence over the President.In fact, these provisions of the new Constitution seem to have been designed to emphasise the point that the King has no part whatever in the internal Constitution of the Irish Free State.(ii) No doubt the reasons which have kept the Irish Free State Government away from the present Imperial Conference are transitory, and if no similar reasons present themselves on a future occasion, the Free State Government would take part in any other Imperial Conference. Nevertheless, the attitude of the Free State Government to the present Conference is an indication of how weak is the Free State&apos;s will to co-operate in matters of common concern. They will co-operate when it suits them, but not otherwise.M. M.June 3, 1937.P.S. Since this memorandum was drawn up my attention has been called to a statement made by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy in the Dublin High Court on the 11th May, 1937. In the course of his judgment in a case re Dowling (an application for an order of habeas corpus on behalf of a man who had been arrested on a Scottish Warrant) he is reported (Irish Independent, the 12th May) to have said : &quot; It has now been made clear by the legislation of 1935 that our citizen is a citizen of Saorstat Eireann for all purposes municipal and international, and that he is not a British subject.&quot;This statement (though it formed. part of a dissenting judgment by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy on the point immediately at issue in the case) has received considerable publicity. I understand that the case itself has not yet been concluded. It is perhaps rather more difficult for us to stand by the position as regards allegiance outlined in paragraph 8 of this memorandum now that the attitude which was taken up hei&apos;e in 1935 with regard to Irish Free State citizenship has been challenged not only by Mr. de Valera from the political point of view, but also, even if only &quot; obiter,&quot; in the Free State Courts.M. M.June 4, 1937.
APPENDIX VI.Terms of Reference to Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE Chiefs of Staff are asked to advise with reference to C.I.D. Paper No. 416-C :-(1) For what purposes is it intended to employ the Defended Ports in the Irish Free State in the event of a major war where their use is needed ?(2) If the Ports remained in our hands and if on the outbreak of war the Irish Free State were to adopt a hostile attitude, would the Ports under those conditions be of sufficient importance to us to warrant the additional measures necessary to ensure their security?(3) If the Ports had previously been, handed over to the Irish Free State, and if on the outbreak of war the Irish Free State were to deny us their use, would the importance of the Ports be so great as to warrant military operations to regain the possession and use of them?
