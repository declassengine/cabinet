THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1937.SECRET. . Copy No.CP. 318 (37).CABINET.PROPOSED APPOINTMENT OF IRISH FREE STATE minister in ROME.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the notes of conversa-tions which I had with Mr. Dulanty last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday regarding Mr. de Valera&apos;s sudden announcement that the Irish Free State proposed to appoint a Minister in Rome, and that in his Letters of Credence the King of Italy would also be described as &quot; Emperor of Ethiopia.&quot;M. M.December 20, 1937.I.Note of a Conversation with the High Commissioner for the Irish Free state on Wednesday, December 15, 1937.I saw Mr. Dulanty this evening and asked him whether he had received the same shock as I had on opening the Times this morning. He replied that he had been so busy all day that he had not seen the Times. When I showed hin the report that Mr. de Valera had announced in the Dail that the Irish Free State had established diplomatic contact with the Government of General Franco and that in the letters of credence of the new Irish Free State Minister to Rome the King of Italy would be described as &quot; King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia,&quot; he was plainly rather troubled.I said that in a talk which I had with Mr. de Valera in London immediately after the League Assembly [circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 237 (37)] the President had assured me that he was anxious to co-operate with the United Kingdom in matters of common concern in international affairs. But that anxiety was not very manifest in the present case. I assumed that Mr. de Valera&apos;s latest act meant de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia, and thought this was an important matter of common concern; the Irish Free State Government should not have taken the step which it had now announced without prior consultation with the other Governments of the British Commonwealth. This seemed to me especially so in view of the fact that Mr. de Valera knew well from our telegrams to him that, whilst we would be prepared to consider de jure recognition as part of a general settlement of outstanding questions with Italy, we were not disposed to grant that recognition by itself. It was possible, of course, that Mr. de Valera would not agree with this argument, and would say that this was not a matter of common concern in which consultation was required. Even if he thought that and I did not myself see what grounds he could have for thinking it the spirit of co-operation[16363]
between the members of tJhe Commonwealth would seem to require that he should at least have informed us of his intention to act contrary to our own policy before making that announcement to the world. But he had not even asked Mr. Dulanty to give us five minutes&apos; warning of what he intended; I thought even ordinary courtesy should have prompted that much warning. As it was, we in the United Kingdom had to discover from our newspapers what was the foreign policy of our partner across the Irish Sea.I said that I did not propose to enter into the merits of the policy of de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia at the moment. That was not the point at issue; what concerned me was the complete failure on the part of the Irish Free State Government to show any spirit of co-operation with us on a matter of very great importance which was also a matter of common concern. But on the merits of the policy it did seem to me strange that the Irish Free State of all countries should at the present moment give support to the European Dictators who were trying to divide the democratic and freedom-loving countries from each other. The Irish Free State&apos;s recognition of the new Italian Empire would be hailed with delight in Rome and Berlin, and no doubt would give pleasure as far afield as Tokio as well.Mr. Dulanty confessed that he was extremely surprised at the policy announced by Mr. de Valera. He had had no warning of it himself, though in the course of a telephone conversation which he had held that day on another matter with Mr. Walshe, the Permanent Head of the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, the latter had incidentally referred to Mr. de Valera&apos;s announcement. Mr. Walshe sought to explain that accrediting their Minister to the &apos;&apos; King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia &apos;&apos; did not involve de jtcre recognition of the Italian conquest.I answered that the view of our Foreign Office had always been that such a step as had now been taken by the Irish Free State Government did involve de jure recognition.&apos; Mr. Dulanty said that he shared that view. In any case, speaking personally, he thought this latest piece of Irish Free State policy was entirely wrong, and he agreed with me that it was a subject on which there should have been prior consultation with us. He did not attempt to hide his definite and strong agree-ment with my representations, and promised to speak to Mr. de Valera.M. M.December 15, 1937.II.Note of a Conversation with the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State onThursday, December 16, 1937.I had a further talk with Mr. Dulanty this evening. I told him that since our conversation yesterday I had received the Irish newspaper reports of the Dail debate when Mr. de Valera announced the proposed appointment of a Minister to Rome. These reports made clear, what The Times had omitted, that Mr. de Valera did not regard recognition of the title &quot;King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia &quot; as involving de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s conquest of Abyssinia. On the contrary, he had formally and publicly declared in the course of the debate that it did not constitute such recognition, and that the Irish Free State, in fact, did not recognise the new Italian Empire de jure.I said that, so far as it went, this made Mr. de Valera&apos;s action less serious from the European point of view. Although we regarded recognition of the title as involving de jure recognition of the conquest, that view was not held in some foreign countries, whose Governments had taken the same line as the Irish Free State Government had taken now. I found it hard to discover Mr. de Valera&apos;s reasons for arguing that there was a distinction; nevertheless, it was something that he had made a public declaration of non-recognition of the conquest. But all this did not affect in the least the issue on which I had made representations to him (Mr. Dulanty) yesterday. The matter was still one on which I thought Mr. de Valera should-have consulted us before finally reaching, and certainly before publishing, a decision.
Mr. Dulanty replied that he had spoken to Mr. de Valera on the matter by telephone the previous evening. He had reported my views to Mr. de Valera and told him frankly that he himself shared those views. He got the impression that Mr. de Valera was1 not very happy at his own decision in the matter. Mr. Dulanty was inclined to think that a decision had been pressed upon him by Mr. Walshe, the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of External Affairs, who is a zealous Roman Catholic and at one time intended becoming a priest. (In a subsequent telephone conversation which Mr. Dulanty had with Mr. Walshe, the latter had spoken as though he was mainly responsible for the policy, and remarked that Mr. de Valera now seemed &apos;&apos; rather peeved &apos;&apos; with him about it.) Mr. de Valera had not complained of my representations, but urged that it would have been more awkward for us to know about his decision before it was public than to remain ignorant of it until publication.I answered that consultation in international affairs would become- farcical if we adopted the principle that we only consulted together when we knew that we were all in agreement on policy, and refrained from consultation if there was any likelihood of disagreement. In that case we would be constantly giving each other unpleasant surprises, and harmony between the members of the British Commonwealth would be turned into discord. Consultation was desirable precisely in those cases where there, might be disagreement, so that time was given for an attempt to accommodate our differences, without prejudice to the right of each member of the Commonwealth to act according to its own free judgment and decision. The Irish Free State Government would.be the first to complain if the United Kingdom Government reached some decision which affected the Irish Free State and which damaged the Free State&apos;s position without giving the Free State Government fair warning and a chance to express its views. The Free State would be right in complaining of such conduct, and therefore I thought we were perfectly justified in ourselves complaining when the position was reversed. I quoted to Mr. Dulanty one or two cases when we had decided on a policy, but modified it subsequently on account of views expressed by Irish Free State Ministers.Mr. Dulanty repeated that he was really in agreement as to this, and that he thought Mr. de Valera a little bit regretted his hasty action.I asked Mr. Dulanty whether the actual submission for the new Irish Fi*ee State Ministers credentials recognising The King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia &apos;&apos; had yet been sent to the Palace. If it had not I thought it would be extremely convenient if the submission was held up for as long as possible. I understood that the Minister would not be going to Rome until February.Mr. Dulanty answered that he thought that the submission had arrived in his office, and that he feared it would therefore have been sent to the Palace for the King&apos;s signature without delay. If it had not gone to the Palace, he would hold it up in his office for some weeks. If he found that it had already been sent to the King, would I like him to ring up Sir Alexander Hardinge to get it held up in the Palace?I replied that this was no business of mine. I certainly would not ask him to suggest a delay in the Palace. This was a matter on which His Majesty was being advised by his Free State Ministers, and it was at least doubtful whether a United Kingdom Minister should take any step to interfere with that advice once it had been sent to His Majesty. If he telephoned to Sir Alexander, he must do it entirely on his own responsibility. But I was expressing my own opinion that it would turn out to be convenient if the Submission did not reach His Majesty at present.Mr. Dulanty said that he would make enquiries in his office at once, and that if the document had not gone to the Palace, he would hold it up, and that if it had gone to the Palace, he would take upon himself the responsibility of asking-Sir Alexander Hardinge not to put it before the King for the present.M. M.December 16, 1937.
December 17, 1937.M. M.Note of a Conversation tvith the High Commissioner for the Irish Free State onFriday, December 17, 1937.Mr. Dulanty telephoned to me this morning to say that a document for transmission to the King had arrived in his office and been sent to the Palace. But this document was only the one authorising the opening of an Irish Free State Legation in Rome, and was not concerned with the form of the new Minister&apos;s credentials. He undertook to see that the latter document, if it came to his office, would not be passed on at present; but his impression was that it would not arrive in any case until early in February.He told me that he had been reading a letter by Professor Berriedale Keith in the Scotsman of the 16th December, which suggested that the Letters of Credence of an Irish Free State Minister could be signed by the new Commission which was to be set up in the Irish Free State,&quot; and need not go to the King at all. He enquired what our view would be regarding that. I answered that of all the wrong things which the Irish Free State Government might do, we would think the most wrong would be failure to submit for His Majesty&apos;s signature documents concerning international affairs which properly required his consent.
