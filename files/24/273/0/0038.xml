BRITISH LINER COMMUNIQATION ACROSS THE PACIFIC.Joint Memorandum by the Changellor of the Exchequer, the &quot;Secretary of Sjtatg_f.gr Dominion Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade.Competition of Matson Line against British Lines.1. The British Shipping Lines maintaining passenger,mail and cargo services across the Pacific between the westcoast of North America and Australia and New Zealand have suffered serious losses of business to their United Statescompetitor, the Matson Line,  since 1959 when the MatsonLine, with extensive financial assistance fron the UnitedStates Government., brought into operation two new vesselsfar&quot;exceeding in luxury and speed those of the British Lines.2. The Matson Line runs from San Francisco calling atxHonolulu and Fiji.      It carries passengers but not cargo between Australia and New Zealand.      A service to San Francisco calling at Tahiti and carrying both passengers and cargo between Australia and New Zealand was operated by the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand until the end of 1956 when the Company, which apparently did not consider that it had a case for Government assistance, withdrew from the trans-Pacific service.      The Canadian-Australas ian Line  (jointly owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand)  operates a service from Vancouver, calling at Honolulu and Fiji, and carryingx. Trade between the mainland of the United states andHonolulu is reserved by United States law to American ships.
passengers and cargo between Australia and New Zealand. The Line is at present maintained by two vessels,  one of which (built in 1913)  is overdue for replacement,  and the other (built in 1924) cannot compete with the much newer and better American vessels,.Application of Canadian-Australasian Line for assistance * 3. The Canadian-Australasian Line has applied to thevarious interested. Governments of the British Commonwealth for financial assistance to enable it to bull- vessels capable of holding their own against those of the Matson Line.    The matter was referred in the first place for examination in its technical aspects to the Imperial Shipping Committee, ^ano reported in October 1936 that there was no alternative, if the British service was to be maintained.,  to providing ships capable of matching the American ships, but that the earnings of the proposed new British ships, while possibly sufficient to cover operating costs, could not be expected to provide anything in respect of capital costs.4. After exchanges of views between the Governments of theUnited Kingdom,  Canada, the Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand, a Committee of Ministers representing those four Governments discussed the matter during the Imperial Conference 1937.      As a result of these discussions,  and of meetings between the Ministers and representatives of the ship-owners,  the general outline of a scheme of assistance was adopted.    The mai&quot;? features of this outline are summarised in the appendix to this note.5. When the Ministers attending the Imperial Conferencedispersed, the understanding was that they would be prepared to recommend to their Governments a scheme of assistance
based on this outline;    and a committee of Officials, including officials from each of the thvee Dominions concerned, vras left to xrorlc out, with the Shipping Companies&apos;   representatives, a complete, detailed scheme for submission to, and consideration by,  the respective Governments.6. A complete draft Agreement, based on the provisionalunderstandings reached by the Cornmittee of Ministers in London, was despatched to the Canadian, Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments in October 1937.      This provided that the assistance to be granted b;:r the participating Governments to the Line should take the form of a twenty year guarantee of the capital and interest of a loan, not exceeding  2.6 million,  to be raised by the Line and used (with  1 million of capital provided by the parent Companies) to pay the cost of two new vessels. &quot;    This would have involved an annual liability for a payment by the United Kingdom Government of the order of  40,000 for twenty years. 7. The draft Agreement had the approval of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and the President of the Board of Trade;    and the financial provisions, in so far as they involved liability on the United Kingdom Exchequer, were in accordance with decisions taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.x The form in which the financial assistance required by the Canadian-Australasian Line should be given by the participating Governments was not settJ-ed by the Ministers before they returned to their respective countries, though the discussions centred upon some form of guarantee,  involving liability over a period-&quot; of 20 years, and in particular upon the method of joint and several guarantee, i.e. the whole service of the loan would he guaranteed by each guarantor and the lender would have legal recourse, for the whole amount due to him, against any one guarantor.    The guarantors would Toe free to make between themselves such arrangements as they chose regarding the actual proportions in which they contributed to the service of the loan, and any one guarantor, if called upon by the lender to honour his guarantee of the whole service, would have legal rights against his fellow guarantors.     The practical advantage of such an arrangement   is that it would enable a loan to be raised at the rate of interest appropriate to the most credit-worthy of the guarantors.
Attitude of Australia and New Zealand. 8. The Commonwealth Government made a public statement in September to the effect that they were prepared, to introduce legislation to give effect to the scheme.      (This statement was based on a draft prior to the complete draft issued in October, but the differences between the drafts are not such as to be likely to affect the attitude of the Government).9. The New Zealand Government informed theUnited Kingdom Government in September that they approved the financial basis of the scheme, butthey raised some questions about other provisions, including particularly the questionwhether one of the two ships epuld be based on new Zealand instead of both being based onAustralia as required by the Commonwealth Government.Disarrproval of draft Agreement by Canadian Government.10.        The Canadian Government communicated with the United Kingdom Government in September, criticising the proposal that the governments guarantee of the loan should be a joint and several one, and raising questions about some of the arrangements for the proposed service. 11.        The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs sent a letter and memorandum to the other Governments in October,  discussing the points raised by New Zealand and Canada    with a view to disposing.of them.      Nothing further has been heard from the Commonwealth or New Zealand Governments, but the Canadian Government have now (December 1937)  informed the other Governments
that, after considering the draft Agreement in the light of the considerations raised hy them in September, they are unable to approve it. 12o       The Canadian Government&apos;s principal difficulty appears to be the proposal that they should commit themselves to give assistance to the Line over a period of twenty years.      Their objection to any long-period commitment goes to the root of the present scheme, since an assurance of assistance over a long period of years is the only basis on which the Line could undertake the construction of the necessary new tonnage.      This fundamental fact has been recognised from the outset, &quot;and the Canadian Ministers attending the Imperial Conference fully appreciated it.13.        In addition to their other difficulties,  the Canadian Government (according to a telegram from the United Kingdom High Commissioner) are not enthusiastic for an attempt to compete in the Pacific with the United States.      There is good reason to suppose, however, that the United States Government would not consider themselves seriously aggrieved by the advent of a subsidised British Line trading across the Pacific.      The British Shipping Companies concerned have also indicated their expectation that the existing good relations between the Matson Line and the Canadian-Australasian Line would be maintained after the proposed new British vessels came into operation.
&amp;l :&apos;3 2Present Position. 14* As it may be assumed that the commonwealth and New Zealand Governments are ready,  in principle, to go on with the scheme if Canada, as well as the United Kingdom,  is prepared to do so,  it seems that the possibility of further progress depends on the final attitude of the Canadian Government.    The immediate question for consideration is whether any further steps should he taken by the United Kingdom Government at this stage with a view to finding a solution*150 The United Kingdom are interested in thematter from the general point of view of British shipping policy and the prestige of the British flago Considerable advantage would also accrue to this country through the fact that the two new vessels provided for in the scheme would be built in Great Britain and registered in the United Kingdom.    It is however,  incontestable that the interests of the three Dominion Governments are both more direct and more substantial than that of the United Kingdom Government;    and it may be anticipated, that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Hew Zealand Government will not willingly acquiesce in the breakdown of the discussions.    The Shipping Companies concerned will also,  of course,  exercise all the pressure of which they are capable.    The Canadian Pacific Company is now in fact discussing the matter with the Canadian Government and has not given up hope that an agreement with that Government may be reached.16, In all the circumstances, we think the nextmoves may safely be left to these other parties, and
that the United Kingdom Government need not initiateaction at the momenta    If the Commonwealth Govern-ment or the New Zealand Government should seek theadvice of the United Kingdom Government on thesituation, we propose to advise them to carry onthe discussion of the matter direct with Canadaon the understanding that the United Kingdom Govern-ment, if their co-operation is desired by the other three Governments,  remain ready to co-operate,subject to the fundamental conditions which makeUnited Kingdom participation possible.Of these conditions the principal are -(l) that the interest of the Dominion Governments is direct and primary; and(2) that the scheme must not involve the grant by the United Kingdom Government of a subsidy to the Line. H17. If an early statement on the subject has tobe made in Parliament, we would propose that,subject to any inter-Governmental discussions whichmay be taking place.at the time, the attitude ofthe United Kingdom Government should be stated onthe lines indicated in this note.J.

9 K A fc,- J ytjl Jr jr caw-LAErief outline of the &quot;pronosed scheme,1. Two new vessels were to he built inGreat Britain for a service between Vancouver, Hew Zealand and Australia, calling at San Francisco on the south bound run,  and at Honolulu and Fiji in both directions.      The Parent Companies (the Canadian Pacific and the Union Steamship Company of Hew Zealand) were to provide between them  1 million of the capital for the purpose and the remainder, not to exceed  2. 6 million, was to be raised by a Loan repayable ( capital and interest) in twenty ecual annual instalments, these repayments being guaranteed by the Governments.2. The vessels were to be operated in theservice for twenty years by a new Company to be formed in place of the existing Canadian-Australasian Line.3. Any deficiency of earnings as againstoperating costs in any year was to be made good by an advance by the Parent Companies, which could be recovered by them in subsequent years so far&quot; as the earnings permitted.      Any excess of earnings in any year over operating costs (after recovery of any such advances) was to be applied to providing a Depreciation Fund up to 5&apos;,* of  1 million in an?/ one year.    The balance remaining was to be shared equally between the Company on the one hand, and the Governments on the other hand-. Out of the Company&apos;s share, dividends up to 5 o per annuities&apos;a could be paid on the capital subscribed by the Parent Companies.
The understanding was that theGovernments would meet the payments falling due annually to the Lender, recouping themselves (no doubt only in part) out of their share of any surpluses on operating account,-, as explained in paragraph 5o50 The Loan was to be guaranteed jointlyand severally by the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand^      Payments under the guarantee were to be made by the Governments in the following proportionst-responsibility of the Government of Fiji, whosepresent annual payment of  5,000 to the Linewould cease when the new vessels came into service^annually the sum of  50,000 in respect of the carriage of mails.      This amount was to be paid in agreed proportions by the Governments of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and New Zealand,  the Canadian Government having the right to recover from the United Kingdom Government payment at the recognised rates forthe mails   aespatehed from the United Kingdom. 7. The proportions stated in paragraph 5resulted from negotiations with the Ministers representing the Dominions at the time of the Imperial Conferenceo      The shares of Canada and New Zealand were based generally on the amountsUnited Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand.21o4236Co 34c 2857;-o 18o5714$ 22*8571$The balance of 2o 8572/6 was to be the6cIn addition,  the Line was to receive

The share of the United Kingdom would heof the order of  40,000 per annum for twenty years, which would be reduced by the amount of any receipts from the Line in respect of- surplus on operating account.
