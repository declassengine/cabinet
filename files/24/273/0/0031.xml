CP. 506(57).^^J^&amp;SL^^^J^^^LMJSSlJ^^SSS. majesty1 s cxmsmEm.SECRET.rah.\  COPY NO.&apos; CABINET. &apos; /&apos;^ggilTIQN   Ajg!   tre-lEffi-tt   OF   bliiiditess    (SCOTLAM)) BILL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.1.     This Bill which has &quot;been introduced by Mr. Chapman, follows the lines of provisions which have been in force in England since 1925 and which are included in the consolidating Public Health Act of 1S36.2.     Certain measures for the prevention of blindness are already taken by local authorities in connection with existing statutory services such as Maternity and Child Welfare and the School Medical Service, The powers given in this Bill will enable them to co-ordinate and intensify existing measures, to extend the scope of these to   include the systematic &apos; provision of ophthalmic treatment for persons threatened with blindness, to secure that the facilities provided are readily available to these persons and to arrange for the distribution of information regarding the prevention of blindness.     In making use of these powers the local authority will he able either to provide the necessary services themselves or to arrange for their provision by an external agency.5.     The Bill has &quot;been given an unopposed Second Reading and I have no reason to anticipate that it will prove in any way controversial. I regard its provisions as reasonable and I accordingly desire the authority of my colleagues to indicate that it has the Governments sympathy, and. to co-operate in its consideration in Committee,     I hope bliat the remaining stages in the House of Commons, like the Second Heading, will be unopposed..W.E.E.
