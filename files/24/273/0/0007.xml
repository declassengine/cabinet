(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.Copy no cp. 282  (37)CAB I N E T.REFORM OF PENAL LAW.Memorandum by the Home Seoretary.1.     I am anxious to introduce in the present Session of Parliament a comprehensive measure for improving the methods of dealing with persons found guilty of offences.      On several aspects of this problem there have been recommendations for legislation by Departmental Committees.2.     The Committee on the Treatment of Young Offenders reported in 1927.       While effect was given by the Children and Young Persons Act of 1933 to their recommendations so far as they related to children and young persons,  there has been no legislation to carry out their recommendations regarding offenders between the ages of 17 and 21.3.     The Committee on the Treatment of Persistent Offenders reported in 1932, and no steps have yet been taken to give effect to their recommendations.4.     T^e Committee on the Social Services in Courts of Summary Jurisdiction reported in 1936, and some of their recommendations involve amendments of the law relating to probation.5.     I have in mind a comprehensive Bill covering the following points:-(a) Probation.undisputed, and It is very desirable to make such amendments of the law as experience has shown to be desirable.      These amendments are mainly concerned with matters of detail and are generally of an uncontroversial character.      The first part of the proposed Bill might consolidate, with the necessary amendments, the existing law which is at present scattered over several statutes.The value of this method in suitable cases is now
(b) Persistent Offenders.Of the persons sent t o prison for the first time a large proportion (about 80 per cent.) do not return, but amongst those who go back there is a number of persistent offenders who are repeatedly in and out of prison.      For such persons sentences based on the circumstances of the particular offence with which the offender is charged are often useless.      There ought to be power to deal with such persons on their records and to impose sentences which are appropriate either fro the protection of the public or for the training of such offenders,  especially the younger offenders, as are likely to respond to remedial methods of treatment.      This principle was recognised in the Prevention of Grime Act,  1908, but the provisions in Part II of that Act authorising preventive detention for habitual criminals are so framed that such sentences can rarely be passed, and,  in any case, can only be imposed as an addition to a sentence of penal servitude.      I would propose in the Bill to repeal Part II of the Act of 1908 and to substitute provisions enabling Courts of Assize and Quarter Sessions to pass in lieu of sentences of imprisonment or penal servitude (a) sentences of detention for any period of not less than two and not more than four years, where it appears to the Court that by reason of the offender&apos;s criminal habits or tendencies his detention is expedient for the prevention of crime, and (b) sentences of prolonged detention for any period of not less than five and not more than ten years if the offender is convicted of serious crime and has since attaining the age of 16 years at least three convictions of crime and the Court is of opinion that his criminal habits and mode of life are such that his detention for a lengthy period of years is expedient for the protection of the public.
(c) Observation Centres for Young Offenders.It is important that the Courts &quot;before deciding how to deal with the young offender should obtain information as to his circumstances,  antecedents and character,  and,  if necessary, a medical report on any physical or mental peculiarities.      For this purpose remand in custody may frequently be necessary, but at present the only places available for the accommodation of persons remanded in custody are prisons.      I would propose that the Bill should authorise the provision of special establishments for the accommodation of young offenders on remand where medical reports can be prepared and information obtained by social workers as to their circumstances.The new system might then be started in London and extended later to some of the large provincial cities.(d) Borstal Sentences.Some amendments of the law relating to Borstal sentences are required, but the only controversial point is the recommendation of the Young Offenders Committee that Courts of Summary Jurisdiction should be given power to pass such sentences, Under the existing law Borstal sentences can only be passed by Courts of Assize or Quarter Sessions,  except in the special cases of young people who escape from, or misbehave in, Approved Schools-In these special cases Courts of Summary Jurisdiction have power to commit the offender to Borstal.Every year 1600-1700 young people under 21 are sentenced to imprisonment, and a large proportion of these are youths who have numerous previous convictions and are in need of a period of training and discipline such as a Borstal sentence would supply. One of the reasons why the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction continue to pass such sentences of imprisonment is that they have not themselves power to pass a Borstal sentence,  and if they
commit a young offender to a higher Court for the purpose of such a sentence, they must send him to prison to await the sitting of Quarter Sessions or Assize.For a long time the policy has been advocated by the Home Office that imprisonment for young people should be avoided if any other method is practicable;    but it cannot be expected that Courts of Summary Jurisdiction will give full effect to this policy so long as these Courts, while empowered to sentence young people to imprisonment, are not entrusted with a power to pass a sentence of reformative training and must,  if they think such a sentence desirable,  send the youth to prison to await such sentence.The remedy is to empower the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction to commit young offenders to Borstal in the same way as they can commitJboys and girls under 17 to Approved Schools.      It will be objected that Courts of Summary Jurisdiction ought not to be entrusted with the power to pass so serious a sentence, but it must be remembered that the success or failure of our methods of dealing with young offenders necessarily depends on the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction      The number of young offenders committed to the higher Courts for trial is a very small proportion of the total.      As regards the great majority of the offenders,  the decision as to treatment must be taken by the Summary Courts. Even as regards Borstal sentences the higher Courts can have no say in the matter unless the Magistrates decide to commit for a Borstal sentence.There is little ground for fearing that the Courts of Summary Jurisdiction would use Borstal sentences too freely and lightly, and the objection that appeals against their decisions are difficult for poor defendants has been removed by the Summary Jurisdiction (Appeals) Act, 1933.
(o) Penal Servitude and Hard Labour.The treatment in prison of ai person sentenced topenal servitude does not differ from that of a person sentenced to imprisonment, nor does the treatment of a person sentenced to hard labour differ materially from that of a person sentenced to simple imprisonments      It would be desirable to get rid of these nominal distinctions, which are survivals of past history and no longer represent real differences.provisions relating to the classification of prisonerso      Some of these provisions hinder rather than help proper classification,, The licensing system for persons sentenced to penal servitude ought also to be abolished.      All prisoners can by good conductimprisonment this remission is absolute, but persons sentenced to penal servitude are released on licence and are liable if reconvicted during the currency of the licence to serve the :;emanent of the old sentence.      There is no good reason for retaining this liability,  and the only value attaching to the convict&apos;s licence is that for the period during which the licence runs (in the great majority of cases this period is not more than nine months) the licenceholder has usually to keep the police informed of his place of residenceoMany offenders, however, who have been convicted more than once of serious crime are sentenced to imprisonment and not to penal servitude, and in such cases the police have no means of knowing what becomes of the offender on&apos;his release from prison. The lav/ ought to be amended so as to require all persons who have been convicted more than once of serious crime - whether the conviction results in a sentence of imprisonment or a sentence of penal servitude - to report their place of abode to the police, unless the Court for special reasons thinks such a requirementIt is also desirable to amend some of the statutoryand industry earn remission of sentence0On sentences of
unnecessary.(f) Criminal Lunatics.Offenders who are certifiable as insane are liable to he sent to the State Asylum at Broadmoor or to a local mental hospitalo      In law such offenders are styled &quot;criminal lunatics1-and the institution at Broadmoor is called a &quot;Criminal Lunatic Asylum&quot;,,      The term &quot;criminal lunatic&quot; is an unhappy one.      It causes unnecessary pain to relatives and is inappropriate, inasmuch as the person who commits an offence while insane has no mens rea.      The terms &quot;State mental patient&quot; and &quot;State mental hospital&quot; should he substituted,Moreover, after discussion with the Minister of Health I think it would be advantageous to transfer to the Board of Control the responsibility for the management of Broadmoor Asylum, while retaining for the Home Secretary the responsibility of deciding when a criminal lunatic shall be released from custody.      Special considerations arise as regards the discharge from custody of persons who while insane have committed offences against the criminal law, but the treatment of such persons while under detention stands on the same footing as the treatment of other lunaticso      They have to be treated as patients rather than as offenders,  and the responsibility for the treatment of such mental patients should rest on the Department in which information and experience about the treatment of insanity is centralised.      It is proposed to include in the Bill provisions to give effect to these changes.6.    If the Cabinet approve generally of these proposals, a Bill will be prepared and submitted for careful study by the Home Affairs Committee.
18th November, 1937.7.      I have consulted the Secretary of State for Scotland with regard to the foregoing proposals.      I under-stand that, in his view,  existing conditions in Scotland would not justify their general application in that country but that he may wish to provide for the application of a certain number of them.      I shall,  therefore, keep in close touch with him in the preparation of the details of the legislation proposed.S. H o
