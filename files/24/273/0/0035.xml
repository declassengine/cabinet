Copy No.CP. 310 (37).CABINET.POLICY IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE a revised draft despatch to the High Commissioner for Palestine, in which I have endeavoured to meet the views expressed by my colleagues.If this draft is approved, I propose to send the despatch at once, and to arrange for it to be published in Palestine, and simultaneously laid as a Command Paper in this country, on the 5th January, 1938.(Initialled) W. O. G.Colonial Office, December 17, 1937.Second Revised Draft of Proposed  Despatch to High  Commissionerfor Palestine.(Amendments and additions shown in italics.)Sir,I HAVE the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have had under consideration the Statement of Policy in Palestine issued in July last (Command 5513), and the conclusions to be drawn from the resolutions on the subject which have been passed first by the House of Commons and subsequently by the Permanent Mandates Commission and the Council and Assembly of the League of Nations. A memorandum containing relevant extracts from the Statement of Policy and the resolutions in question, and containing also extracts from Ministerial statements, is enclosed for convenience of reference.[Paragraph 2 omitted.]2. I feel that it is necessary to emphasise certain implications of the acceptance in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the recommendations contained in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, and to dispel, if possible, the uncertainty which appears to exist in some quarters with regard to the course of action which His Majesty&apos;s Government have in view.3. In the Statement of Policy His Majesty&apos;s Government have expressed their general agreement with the arguments and conclusions of the Royal Commission and their opinion that a scheme of tripartite division is the best and. most hopeful solution of the problem. In view of the public attention that has been devoted to criticism of certain features of the tentative plan of partition which is outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, I wish to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government are in no sense committed to approval of that plan, and in particular that they have not accepted the Commissions proposal for the compulsory transfer in the last resort of Arabs from the Jewish to the Arab area.[16356]
4. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government the discussions at Geneva justify the undertaking of the further investigations required for the drawing up of a more precise scheme expressed in greater detail. The final decision -cannot be taken in merely general terms, and the object of the further enquiry must be to provide materials on which to judge, when the best possible scheme has been formulated, whether it is equitable and practicable.5. As you are aware, it has been announced that a further special body will be appointed to visit Palestine, and to submit to His Ma j esty&apos;s Government, after consultation with the local communities, proposals for a detailed scheme of partition; and that it will be the task of this body to advise in due course as to the provisional boundaries of the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and of the new British Mandated area, and also to undertake the financial and other enquiries for which the Royal Commission recommended that a Financial Commission should be appointed. The functions of this new body will be to act as a technical Commission, that is to&apos; say, its functions will be confined to ascertaining facts and to considering in detail the practical possibilities of a scheme of partition.6.   The terms of reference of the technical Commission will be as follows :--&quot; Taking into account the plan of partition outlined in Part III of the Report of the Royal Commission, but with full liberty to suggest modifications of that plan, including variation of the areas recommended for retention under British Mandate,And taking into account any representations of the communities in Palestine and Trans-Jordan (i) to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained permanently or temporarily under British Mandate, which will (a) afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment, with adequate security, of self-supporting Arab and Jewish States;(&amp;) necessitate the inclusion of the fewest possible Arabs and Arab enterprises in the Jewish area and vice versa; and(c) enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry out the Mandatory responsibilities, the assumption of which is recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission, including the obligations imposed by Article 28 of the Mandate as regards the Holy Places;(ii) to examine and report on the economic and financial questions involved in partition upon which decisions will require to be taken, including (a) the allocation so far as may be necessary between the various areasof the public assets and public debt of Palestine and other &apos; financial obligations legitimately incurred by the Administra-tion of Palestine during the period of the Mandate &apos; referred to in Article 28 thereof;(b) means to ensure that the financial obligations referred to abovetoill be fully honoured in accordance with Article 28 of the Mandate-(c) the administration of the railways, ports, postal, telegraph and telephone services;(d) currency arrangements;(e) customs administration and tariffs;(/) the budgetary prospects of the various Administrations to be established;(g) the preservation of the rights of Civil Servants in accordance withthe provisions of Article 28 of the Mandate;(h) the treatment of industrial and other concessions;(i) the possibility, of voluntary exchanges of land and population,and the prospects of providing by works of land development room for further settlement to meet the needs of persons desiring to move from one area to another;
I have, &amp;c.(j) the provision of effective safeguards for the rights of religious or racial minorities in the areas to be allocated to Arabs and Jews respectively, including the protection of religious rights arid properties.&quot;7. If, as a result of the investigations of the technical Commission, which -will undoubtedly occupy many months, a scheme of partition is regarded as equitable and practicable by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it will be referred to the Council of the League for consideration. // the scheme is approved by the League Council, a further period ivill be required for the establishment of new systems of government tender mandate in the areas concerned and, if the necessary consent is forthcoming, for the negotiation of treaties with a view to the eventual estab-lishment of independent States. It may also be necessary, in the light of the Commissions report, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to give further consideration to the suggestion of the Permanent Mandates Commission that the Arab and Jewish areas should be administered temporarily under a system of &apos;&apos; cantonisa-tion &quot; or under separate Mandates. It is obvious, therefore, that, for some time to come, any action taken tvill be only of an exploratory nature.[Previous paragraphs 6 and 7 omitted.]8. I will communicate with you further in due course on the subject of the personnel of the Commission and its procedure.
