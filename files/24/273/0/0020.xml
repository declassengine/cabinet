THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 295 (37).CABINET.POLICY IN PALESTINE.IN accordance with Conclusion 10 of the Cabinet Meeting 44 (37) held on the 24th November, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on the probable reactions of foreign Jews to any modification of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to Palestine.A. E.Foreign Office, December 3, 1937.IN order accurately to estimate the probable reactions of Jewish opinion abroad to any change in the Palestine policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is necessary first to consider how that opinion is constituted, what its general attitude has been hitherto, and how it is likely to affect the attitude of the Governments of the countries in which it exists.2. By far the largest and most important of the Jewish communities abroad are those established in the United States of America and Poland. There are also large communities of Jews in Roumania and Austria. The powerful and prosperous Jewish communities formerly established in Germany have now for the most part been forcibly driven into exile or have become at least temporarily submerged. The Jews in the Soviet Union, while important in numbers, have shown little sign of any independent corporate existence, and could hardly express any united opinion not dictated, or at least approved, by the Soviet Government. There are also important bodies of Jews long established in the Middle East, more particularly in Iraq and the Yemen.3. In other countries the Jewish communities are for the most part too small, or have been too completely absorbed into the ordinary national life of the country concerned, as in France, for their reactions to be of great consequence. As regards the Jewish communities in the United States of America and in Poland, the conditions of these two communities differ widely. The American Jews either have already been, or are in process of being, absorbed into the national life of the country, and few emigrate to Palestine. If they do go to Palestine they tend, I understand, to retain their United States citizenship and remain there as foreigners and not as Palestinians. The Polish Jews on the other hand have not been assimilated in Poland partly because under pre-war Russian rule there was no reason for them to become &quot;polonised&quot;; and the present tendency in Poland is setting strongly against their assimilation and is calculated to make it increasingly difficult for them to remain where they are. The Polish Government makes no secret of its desire to get the greatest possible number of Jews out of Poland as quickly as it can.4. The attitude of most non-Palestinian Jews in Europe and America, and of the Governments, such as those of Poland and Roumania, who are anxious to get rid of their Jews, appears to be determined almost entirely by the9592   [16266]
European demographic aspect of the problem. If they come to the conclusion that the Royal Commission^ partition proposals would have offered a real hope of a solution or at least of a substantial easing of the demographic problem of Central European Jewry, and that the abandonment of those proposals would remove any such hope, their reaction will probably be most unfavourable.5. To meet the wish expressed by some of my colleagues, I sent telegrams calling for reports from His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in some of the countries most closely affected, as to the probable reaction of the Jews in the countries in which they reside to any eventual modification of the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The substance of the replies is summarised in the following paragraph.United States.6. For a long time there have been no public expressions of Jewish opinion which have been definite or important, and the Jews in America are so divided in opinion that a predominant Jewish attitude towards the Palestine question cannot be said to exist. But the following points may be regarded as common to the great majority : (a) All are in utmost distress over the sufferings of their race in other lands,(b) All are convinced that an area must be provided capable of affordingrefuge to those who need, or may need, it, though there are wide differences of view as to what the political status of that area should be,(c) Practically all speak with gratitude of the British efforts.If His Majesty&apos;s Government change their plan, there must inevitably be unfavourable reactions, especially among those who have with difficulty brought themselves to accept the Royal Commission^ Report. But the size of the area to be allotted would be of greater importance than its political status, and disappointment would proportionately diminish as the size was increased. (As Sir R. Lindsay&apos;s reply does not completely cover all the possibilities of the situation, I have now addressed a further telegram to him. If his reply arrives in time, I will circulate it to my colleagues.)Poland.The only feature of the Partition plan which has commended it to Jewish opinion has been the fact that it would provide Jewish sovereignty over a definite area to which for the time being more emigrants could go than under the present system. But the Polish Jews have never liked the idea of partition, especially the Revisionists, who are very strong in Poland. They might therefore prefer some scheme which did not include partition, as they would hope eventually to obtain the whole country by peaceful penetration. But any new scheme will be judged primarily by its influence on the question of immigration from Poland, and any suggestion of yielding to Arab pressure is, of course, bound to cause an outcry. The Polish Government are mainly concerned in the prospects of emigration, and not in the details of any settlement.A tistria.The Zionists, who compose the large majority, were at first strongly opposed to partition, but subsequently accepted the idea on the principle of &quot; half a loaf.&quot; They would undoubtedly be bitterly disappointed by, and strongly opposed to. any solution which did not give the Jews some territory in full sovereignty. The Revisionists oppose even partition, and would be still more opposed to any lesser solution. The orthodox Jews, who are few in number, would be disappointed but resigned.Germany.Jewish opinion scarcely exists and in any case cannot be articulate. German Jews are naturally disappointed at Arab resistance to Jewish aspirations and hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government will support the Jewish cause, but they probably realise better than Jewish communities elsewhere the difficulty of the problem.  Reports from German Jews in Palestine indicate that the country has
only a limited capacity for absorbing Jewish immigrants. On the other hand, press propaganda in favour of the Arabs brings the Arabs&apos; case to the notice of the Jews. The partition scheme does not appear to have many enthusiastic adherents in Germany. In short, the Jews in Germany are a negligible quantity and there seems no reason to have regard to reaction on their opinion of any measures His Majesty&apos;s Government may take. This does not apply, of course, to German Jews abroad or to their sympathisers.Iraq.Jewish opinion, while not enthusiastic, is naturally sympathetic towards Zionism, but it has not been expressed for reasons of expediency. It has never favoured the partition scheme and the abandonment of the Royal Commission^ proposals would not cause serious disappointment. If an alternative scheme relieved the present tension between the Jews and Arabs which is disturbing both their business and material welfare, it would be welcomed by the Jews.7. Trom the above reports it will be seen that Jewish opinion is much divided, but that, broadly speaking, the estimate of probable Jewish reactions given in the preceding paragraphs of this memorandum may be regarded as correct.Foreign Office, December 3, 1937.
