sotCONFIDENTIAL.A.C.395.BOARD 0*&apos; TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATE OP TRADE - NOVEMBER,  19 7.Summary of the Reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in November at  97.3 m.  were  18.6 rru more than in November 1936.    Over 60$ of the rise was in food snd raw materials.    Of the increase of  6.9 m. in manufactured goods  1.9 m.  related to iron and steel manufactures,  1.6 m.  to oil,  fats and resins and  1.5 m. to non-ferrous metals and manufactures.    Exports of United Kingdom products,  .45.2 m. , were  6.7 m.  more and re-exports,  5.3m.,  were nearly  1 m.  more than in November 1936.EivIPLOYMENT. The estimated number of insured workers aged 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) at 15th November was 11,575,000 - 36,000 less than in October but 355,000 more than in November,  1936.    The decline in employment between October and November was most marked in the building, textile,  clothing, motor vehicle,  electrical apparatus and tinplate industries, hotel etc.  service and road transport and distributive trades.&quot;    Employment in coal mining-improved.The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 15th November - 1,499,203 - was 108,954 more than at 18th October;    the changes in the various divisions were -London * 22,484South Eastern + 13.007South Western * 5,821Midlands f 11,292North Eastern * 16,488North Western + 24,774Northern +    4.836Scotland * 11.&apos;, 504Fa 1e s -1,2 52-1
RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      In the&apos; four weeks ended 28th November, railway traffic receipts increased by  585,000 (5.07?S) as compared with the corresponding period of 1936.      The value of passenger    traffic increased hy 3.08%, merchandises minerals and livestock hy 4.49% and coal, coke and patent fuel &quot;by 9.35%.      These increases were partly due to increased charges which became operative on 1st October.BANK INC.,     Money remained in ample supply throughout November.      The Treasury Bill rate rose from 10/l.49d.  to 15/0. 22d.      A temporary increase of  20 m. in the fiduciary issue was announced.      The price of cold fluctuated between 139/l0d.  and l40/7d.  and a substantial premium over the dollar parity was maintained throughout the month.      The silver market was dull;    further amounts were sent here from China for safekeeping.      The spot franc was very steady between 147-1471- and the discount on the three months forward rate fell from 5 to 1-g-.      The dollar v/eakened early in the month to 5,05 on heavy selling but later settled down around 4,99,FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.    Belgium.    The belga was much steadier.      The gold efflux ceased and the discount on the three months forward rate fell substantially.Prance.    The franc was strong throughout the month and the forward rate improved sharply.      The Bank of France reduced the discount rate from 34f/o to o% and holdings of gold -and foreign exchange were increased.      The market for rentes remained dull.Holland.    Funds continued abundant.      Activity in the issue market declined sharply.      Government bonds tended to rise lout shares were depressed.      The guilder weakened early in the month in sympathy with the dollar but strengthened later.Poland.     The exchange control regulations relating to the service of new foreign loans were relaxed somewhat.
Switrland.i     The devaluation ox&apos; the Swiss franc seems so far to have &quot;been beneficial.      Prices have shown only a small rise and the industrial position has improved.      The money market has been extremely easy.     During November, the Swiss franc weakened in sympathy with the dollar but the premium on the forward rate was maintained.U.S. A.    The slump in business became more pronounced during November with staple commodity and security prices declining to new low levels and a further decline in industrial activity.      The dollar fluctuated more widely than usual and. gold began to flow out.SHIPPING.    The fall in shipping freights continued, resulting in the first serious contraction of business since the recovery began in the,summer of 1956.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 ^ 100) was 145.04 as compared with 170.13 in October and 111.41 in November, 1936.SHIPBUILDING-.      Shipbuilding and ship repairing were fairly well maintained and there was some improvement in employment.      A number of new orders were placed and some important enquiries were circulating.GOAL.    There was a seasonal expansion in inland demand, but the lull in export trade continued.      Output for the four weeks ended 30th November (19.76 m.  tons) was 1.01 ai, tons more than in the corresponding period in 1936.      Exports in November amounted to 3.51 m.  tons as compared with 3.92 m. tons a year before.      Most markets took more, the main increases being to Italy,.France and Sweden.IRON AND STEEL;    Active conditions continued.      pig iron output (762,300 tons) was IS.5$ more than a year before.    Five more furnaces went into blast and three ceased operations. Crude steel output (1,178,500 tons) reached a new record and was 17.7-0 more than in November, 1936.      The supply of semis wa
much easier owing to the high output and increased Continental deliveries.      Finished steel demand was well maintained and the record output was immediately absorbed. Exports of iron and steel (198,000 tons) were 2,4% more than in November 1936.      Imports (272s500 tons) showed a large increase due mainly to increased imports of pig iron, ferro alloys and semi finished products.Ij-i Scotland the raw &quot;material position was generally much improved.      The volume of iron and steel orders awaiting delivery is such that the Christmas Holidays will have to be curtailed.      On the North East Coast current pig iron output was steadily absorbed and large quantities of foreign ore arrived.      Makers of finished steel continued heavily booked. In the Sheffield area the supply of steel scrap was satisfactory.      Demand for special steels was unabated.      In South Wales heavy steel producers were well employed. Overseas demand for tinplates was quieter but works were busy and operated at 74% of capa.city.ENGINEERING.    The industry is well placed for current and future business and was little affected by recent disturbing economic and political factors.-      There were indications? however, that in certain cases rising costs had caused deferment of work.      Exports of raachinery amounted to  4.8 m. as compared with  3.6 m. in November 1936. Imports ( 1.93 m. ) were  389,000 more.MOTOR INDUSTRY.,   The number of motor vehicles newly registered in October was 30s316 - 3,171 less than a year before j    the decrease in tirivato cars was 2,991.      The   : production of private cars in September was 25,846 (6% less than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 9;290 (2.3% more).      Exports of now private cars and chassis in November amounted to 6,610 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,690 - 4.6% and 3.2% respectively more than in November,  1936. 1,893 complete now private cars wore imported as compared with 1,290 a year ago,
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    The industry generally has plenty of work for months to come though home orders for electrical goods, particularly domestic appliances, have declined during the past two months.    In heavy engineering, export orders during November showed a slight increase on November, 1936; but home orders decreased considerably.      Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.7 m) were 27.9$ more than in November, 1956.    Electricity generated was 13.7$ more.CHEMICALS. During November certain sections of the heavy chemical industry experienced a setback,  due probably to a lack of confidence generally.    Satisfactory new business has, however, been placed for 1938.    Exports of heavy chemicals declined compared with previous months but home deliveries increased.    Deliveries of chlorine products,  although less than in recent months, continued well above those of a year before.    Home demand for dyestuffs fell off appreciably owing to quietness in the textile trades;    foreign sales were well maintained.    Home sales of fertilisers this year are rather less than a year ago but exports have increased.    Home demand for fine chemicals has been maintained at the relatively high level of 1936;    exports have increased particularly to Empire market s.Cotton. The seasonal improvement during October was not maintained.    Production was reduced and the volume of new business was very small.    The daily yarn output index (1935 = 100) was 117 as .c rmpared with 118 in October and 120 in November, 1956.    Raw cotton prices were fairly steady.    Spinners margins continued steady,  but cloth prices showed signs of further weakness.   Exports both of yarns and piece goods were less than in any month this year.    Yarn exports at 11.4 m.lbs. were 1.6 m. less than in October last and lm. less than in November, 1956.    Exports of piece goods at 151 m. square yards were 3m. less than in October last and in November, 1936. Compared with October, exports to India, South Africa, Australia Denmark, Germany, Holland, Argentina, French West Africa and the Dutch East Indies fell appreciably.    Exports to British West Africa and Canada increased.
WOOL.      General activity declined further, particularlyin Bradford, Huddersfield and the heavy woollen area. Exports of tops and yarns were considerably less in volume and exports of tissues rather more than in November, 1936. Raw wool prices again declined heavily,  falling,  on average, well below those of a year ago.     Reports indicated that there were rather more enquiries for further business but that lack of confidence was restraining customers from placing orders beyond their immediate needs.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.      Rayon.      The recession in the weaving trade continued.      The dress goods section was quiet and the demand for crepe s^arns fell off considerably.      Trade in staple fibre was very quiet. Conditions in the piece goods section remained very poor and the imnediate future is not promising.      Exports of yarns and all-rayon fabrics and mixtures showed substantial increases over November, 1936.Silk.      The seasonal slackness in the silk piece goods trade was particularly marked.HIDES a&apos;:D LEATHER.      The fall in hide prices continued, owing largely to the lack of confidence in markets generally. Business in nearly all sections of the leather industry was even more restricted than in October, due mainly to the further decline in raw material markets.BUILDING.      Returns received from 141 local authorities show that the estimated cost of buildings, for which plans were approved, was  7.8 m. - 13.5&apos;i&apos; less than the figure for November,  1936.      There were decreases of 39fi for factories and 18.9&apos;;3 for dwelling houses, and an increase of 8% for all other buildings and a Iterations to existing buildings.
POTTERY.    Employment in October was at much the same level as a year before.      Demand for china was quiet. Activity in the  tile section continued satisfactory.    Compared with October, 1935, home sales of sanitary earthenware and orders for electrical fittings decreased considerably.RETAIL TRADE.  The money value of retail sales in October was 4.4$ higher than in October, 1956, as compared with an average rise of 3.1$ for February-September.    Sales of food and perishables increased by 3.9$, due largely to the rise in prices;    sales of other merchandise were * 7$ less. Preliminary returns for November indicated a small increase over November, 1936.AUSTRALIAN TRADE. During the four months ended 31st October, 1,813,000 bales of wool were received into store, as compared with 1,763,000 a year before, the quantities sold or shipped being 628,000 and 661,000 respectively.    Wool exports from 1st July to 30th September,  383,000 bales, were 64,000 more than a year before.    Wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1956,  to 2^nd November were equivalent to 96.9 m. bushels as compared with 98.4 m. bushels a year before. Butter exports from 1st July to 27th November were 29,000 tons as compared with 27,000 a year before.    Imports of merchandise during October amounted to . 11.63 m.    (Australian currency) as compared with  9.87 fa.  in October, 1935.CANADIAN TRADE. Most of the major factors indicating the economic trend during October showed recession.    Security prices fell appreciably.    Wholesale prices were nearly maintained and the index of the physical volume of business rose further.    Total exports decreased after seasonal adjustment, copper, nickel, lumber, shingles and better grade asbestos showing declines.    Exports of zinc and wood pulp increased and gold shipments were greater than in any previous month.      Newsprint production continued at a high level.    The iron and steel inaustry remained active.    The estimated output for the 1937 wheat crop was considerably less than for 1936..
