THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1937.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 299 (37).CABINET.SITUATION IN THE FAR EAST.Question of Withdrawal of British Troops from Shanghai.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for War.THE normal British infantry garrisons in the Far East are as follows :  (a) China.Tientsin one British battalion (with detachment in Peking). Shanghai one British battalion.Hong Kong three British battalions; one Indian battalion. (&amp;) Malaya.Singapore three British battalions.Taiping (on mainland 50 miles South of Penang) one Indian battalion. Port Dickson (160 miles N.W. of Singapore) one Malay battalion.2. Owing to the Sino-Japanese emergency the position at present is as follows : Tientsin unchanged.Shanghai three British battalions of the two reinforcement battalions one forms part of Hong Kong garrison and the other is due to move in normal relief to Singapore.Hong Kong two British battalions; two Indian battalions (including one on temporary loan from India since August 1937).(b) Malaya.Singapore two British battalions.   (The third battalion has been sent to China but its relief, as shown above, is still awaited from Shanghai.) Taiping no change. . Port Dickson no change.3. Singapore is thus short of one-third of its infantry garrison whilst Hong Kong in place of one of its British battalions has an Indian battalion, which India cannot well be expected to spare indefinitely.4. Our forces, together with those of other nationalities, are at Shanghai primarily for the purpose of protecting the International Settlement against injury by Chinese. They are not intended to defend the Settlement against the Japanese, who legally have the same right as other foreign Powers to maintain forces in the Settlement. Owing, moreover, to the disparity in strength, neither the British forces in Shanghai, nor even (assuming that other Powers would co-operate, which is very uncertain) the international forces as a whole, could offer any effective opposition to the Japanese.(a)China.9594   [16276]b
5. In view, therefore, of the role of the international forces, it appears that, as soon as any danger to the Settlement from the incursion of Chinese ceases to exist, the troops should be withdrawn from the perimeter. Danger to the Settle-ment is not confined to that from organised attack, but might arise from an influx of disorderly elements or of refugees in such numbers as to bring risk of over-crowding and disease.6. The Japanese have already expressed the wish to take over the policing of the western residential area, which, whilst outside the boundaries of the Settle-ment, is included within the defensive perimeter (see map).This would postulate the withdrawal of British and Italian troops from that part of the perimeter, but the apparent readiness of the Japanese to defer such action until after the withdrawal of the international troops from the perimeter as a whole (Commander-in-chief, China, telegram No. 470 of the 29th November, 1937) disposes of any question of the desirability of withdrawing from one part of the perimeter before withdrawal elsewhere is possible.At the same time, it seems doubtful whether it will be possible without serious risk of incident, even if the Japanese were agreeable, to maintain British troops, after their withdrawal from the perimeter, in an area controlled by the Japanese.7. With minor exceptions, the permanent quarters of the normal garrison are alb in this western extra-Settlement area. These quarters consist of hutted camps of which two accommodate each approximately half, of the permanent infantry battalion, whilst Headquarters and various small details of other arms occupy two smaller camps.. In anticipation of the possibility of all three battalions remaining in Shanghai after the withdrawal of troops from the perimeter, the General Officer Commanding at present proposes to accommodate one of the additional battalions in the race course buildings and the other in a large school. The race course is within the Settlement, but the school in question, like the camps of the permanent battalion, is in the extra-Settlement area.If, therefore, we are obliged entirely to evacuate the extra-Settlement area without withdrawing any troops from Shanghai as a whole, further accommoda-tion within the Settlement must be found for the permanent battalion and for the second additional battalion. This should not prove an insuperable difficulty, though sufficient accommodation which is hygienically suitable may be hard to acquire except at a considerable cost. ....8. Apart from any question of accommodation, if there is any possibility of a deterioration of our relations with Japan, the strategic objections to retaining the British garrison in Shanghai at its present strength remains.To recapitulate these objections, the primary purpose of reinforcing our garrison was the protection of the Settlement against the Chinese, and the need for this is fast disappearing. To deter Japan from her policy in Shanghai, three British battalions would be no more effective than one, nor, in the event of hostilities ensuing, would three battalions have more chance of survival; with two additional battalions, the withdrawal of our garrison, if that were at all possible, would indeed be more difficult. At the same time, the absence from Hong Kong and Singapore of those two battalions might compromise the security of those fortresses.9. On these grounds, the reduction at the earliest possible moment of the present Shanghai garrison by the withdrawal of one. or preferably both, of the additional battalions would appear to be highly desirable.10. &apos; Whilst purely military considerations afford strong arguments in favour of beginning as soon as possiblethe withdrawal of troops from Shanghai, there are certain political considerations which cannot be overlooked. At the present moment the situation in Shanghai is obscure and the ultimate intentions of the Japanese authorities are Unknown. Though it is obviously true that the forces which we maintain there are unable to offer resistance to the Japanese, or even to impress them, it might be held that withdrawal now would indicate that we were retreating in face of Japanese pressure.11. If withdrawal must be begun, it would seem desirable to explain bur action by reference to a change in the situation at Shanghai and a consequent reduction of our military commitment there. At present our forces are aligned on
[16276]the perimeter, and this disposition can only really be justified by the existence of a threat to Shanghai from outside the Settlement. Such a threat does not now exist, in that the country outside the Settlement for many miles has been cleared of Chinese troops. If it is to be regarded that there is any threat to the Settlement from Japanese troops, quite clearly our available forces would not be sufficient to resist. It would not, therefore, be illogical shortly to withdraw our troops from the perimeter into the Settlement. Accommodation for three battalions within the Settlement is very difficult to find, and it would be quite natural, when we no longer have to hold the line of the perimeter, to reduce our forces in Shanghai by at least one battalion.12. While, therefore, the withdrawal of all the foreign contingents concerned from the perimeter affords the best psychological moment for a reduction of our forces in Shanghai, it must be repeated that at the present moment any withdrawal of British troops from Shanghai might be misinterpreted and might weaken our hand in dealing with the Japanese authorities. On the other hand, it is unfortunately not possible to suggest that any more favourable moment for withdrawal will occur in the near future.13.   We therefore recommend that (i) So long as foreign troops hold the perimeter, there should be nowithdrawal of British troops from Shanghai; (ii) When withdrawal from the perimeter takes place, one battalion might be withdrawn, the difficulty of accommodation being given as a reason;(iii) Of the two remaining battalions, one should be temporarily accommodatedinside the Settlement, and the other in the existing permanent quarters in the western extra-Settlement area. This latter arrangement would involve the risk mentioned in paragraph 6 above, but this would have to be faced : withdrawal of all British troops from the permanent quarters in the extra-Settlement area would give the impression of retreat in face of Japanese encroachment;(iv) Any suggestion for further withdrawal would have to be submitted forconsideration.A.
