THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1937.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 286 (37).CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I SHALL shortly circulate a further memorandum on the subject of our policy in Palestine, in which I propose to make certain observations on the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 281 (37)). In the meantime I circulate, for the information of the Cabinet, an important letter from the Acting High Commissioner dealing with the local situation in Palestine.W. O. G.Colonial Office, November 25, 1937.(Secret.) Government House, Jemsalem,My dear Sir John, November 21, 1937.I HAVE recently been summing up the position in regard to security here for the High Commissioner on his return, and you may like to have my views expressed in a way which would hardly be possible in an official despatch. I apologise at once for inflicting on you such a long letter.There is no burking the fact that the position is bad. As a general proposition it is true to say that neither life nor property is safe in certain parts of Palestine to-day. Assassinations or attempted assassinations occur daily, bomb throwing is comparatively common, acts of sabotage are frequent, armed gangs are loose in the country, reprisals by Jews on a large scale have begun, the roads are unsafe by night and sometimes even by day. Government officials have to move circumspectly to and from their offices, many habitually go armed, some are threatened with assassination and have to be specially protected. The hatred between Arabs and Jews, more particularly in the towns, has been intensified during the past six months; and the Government is no more popular than it was. Propaganda by Arabs in the surrounding countries in favour of a continuance of assassination and against all Government measures is as vicious as it is continuous. Assassinations are organised in so-called friendly countries; and foreign Powers are, I think, helping the forces of disorder here with money and propaganda. The Government cannot trace the wrongdoers and bring them to justice. Arabs shield Arabs, and Jews shield Jews. Economically, the country is at a low ebb.   This is a somewhat dark picture, but substantially true.But, in spite of all this, there are some faint signs that the tide is turning in our favour. The fact is that things will probably have to get worse before they get better and we must have time; for it is not reasonable to expect that the ground swell of last year&apos;s disturbance will subside suddenly; especially when, as has been the case here, we have had to take steps which have raised another tempest to add to the strength of the existing ground swell.The recent troubles have for the most part been confined to a comparatively small area round Jerusalem.  The troubles have been caused by (i) Arab assassins operating mostly from the Old City.(ii) A gang of local Arabs with whom contact has not yet been made.  Theseoperate in the rural area, (iii) Jewish assassins or reprisalists mostly, if not entirely, of the Revisionist persuasion.Sir John E. Shuckburgh, K.C.M.G., C.B. [16207]b
The reason for this concentrated activity in the Jerusalem area is because most of the villages surrounding Jerusalem are very much pro-Mufti and are definitely under the Haram influence. The village Sheikhs and Mukhtars have been accustomed to personal contact with Haj Amin or his minions, from whom they got their orders. And being under his influence more than other villagers they naturally are making more trouble than the villagers with whom the Mufti did not come into personal contact. A further reason is the fact that the Haram still contains a &quot; cell &quot; of organisers of disturbances. These organisers we cannot touch so long as they remain in the Haram. A peculiarity of the present murder campaign is that the murderers on both sides do not much mind whom they kill provided it is one of the other side. Some persons, including Govern-ment officials, are specifically marked down for murder. But the Arab assassin is quite happy provided the man he kills is a Jew, no matter how insignificant. And the Jewish reprisalist, as has been demonstrated recently, is satisfied if he kills a couple of Arab women. This makes it extremely difficult for the Police, who can within limits protect certain individuals, but who cannot prevent, for example, the murder by a Jew of a miserable Arab from Lifta who is toiling into Jerusalem to sell his vegetables, nor the murder by Arabs of two British soldiers who were going for a walk in a main street outside the City.In regard to Government officials, some are definitely marked down for assassination. Those I know of are Foot (Assistant District Commissioner, Nablus), Faraday (Police) and Trusted (Chief Justice). Others about whom warnings have been received, but not, I think, as serious as those mentioned above, are Harris (Executive Council), Rice (Acting Inspector-General of Police), Kirkbride (doing Awcaf work) and myself. It is said that Tegart will be attacked on his arrival, but steps will be taken to look after him. Those named above are being specially looked after, though, of course, that is no guarantee of safety; but no senior Government official can be said to be really safe. All officials have been warned to take care of themselves and many habitually go armed, though that is small protection against the assassin. I do not wish to exaggerate the position in the slightest, but I think you should know not only what the position is, but that the position in this respect differs from that of last year when the prospect of assassination was not so definite.A most disquietening feature of the situation has been the recent outbreak of organised reprisals on a considerable scale on the part of the Jews. The Jewish Agency, the Vaad Leumi, and other responsible Jews genuinely deplore these reprisals and have done all they can to stop them. But I greatly fear that reprisals will continue unless we have had greater luck than is usual in collecting the malefactors in the crowd of Revisionists recently interned. In this connexion the possibility of certain Jews attempting to murder certain British officials must not be overlooked. The Police are, therefore, fighting on two fronts so to speak and the British official is in the unenviable position of being exposed to attacks from both Arabs and Jews, though the possibility of attack from a Jew is far less than it is from an Arab.Then there are the gangs who are operating in the hills. I have already mentioned the gang which is in and around Jerusalem. This is believed to consist of Palestinians and to be led by a local man. It has had by far the best of it so far, being responsible, I think, for every mass outrage in the Jerusalem district, such as the attack on the Potash Convoy, the murder of the five Jews at Enab, and the ambush in which two police lost their lives. Two known gangs have been operating in the north, but they have as yet committed no outrage and information goes to prove that their leaders returned to Syria in disgust and their henchmen have scattered amongst the villages. That is due entirely to the work of the District Administration, the Army and the Police, who have harried and chivvied these gangs from pillar to post and have inflicted casualties on them. But there is an ever present risk that more gangs will come into the country or that one gang will bring off a big coup in the north.I have reached the conclusion that there is no short cut to the suppression of these disorders and that we can only press on vigorously with the measures which have already been adopted. In collaboration with General Wavell, to whom I shall always be indebted for great help and very willing assistance always most ungrudgingly given, I have been constantly taking steps to initiate measures against disturbers of the peace, to harry them, keep them on the run, and if possible to. track them down, to mete out condign punishment to villages which
shelter malefactors, and generally to make things so extremely unpleasant and expensive to sympathisers with disorders as to compel them to keep the peace-Repression of this kind and it is drastic in the extreme is most unpleasant work, but it is essential if we are to make any headway.The Jews have two suggestions which they are continually pressing on me.Shertok and Ben Zvi are extremely anxious that the Jews should be openly associated with the Government in tracking down criminals and taking an active part in suppressing disorders. They consider that all their agriculturalists should be armed for their own protection, that what they call a &quot;pursuit force &quot; of Jews and British should be formed, and that their supernumeraries who have been trained and armed by the Government should take part in activities away from the Colonies which they are supposed to protect. In short, they want the Govern-ment to abandon the principle that the Jews are armed as supernumeraries only for the static defence of their colonies, and for the Government to admit that the common enemy is the Arab. I am resisting this, because to station Jewish supernumeraries in Arab areas would be a great risk. They would form a tempting target for Arabs, and their military value is unknown, but not believed to be high. Further, I am unwilling as yet to abandon the principle stated above. I expect shortly to be using some Jewish supernumeraries who have been specially trained for railway defence work in the patrolling of the railway line within Jewish areas.The reasons which impel Shertok to press this proposal on me are that he is. aware of a change of feeling in the Jewish community as a whole. Their patience is slowly giving out, and he feels that if they are not associated openly with the Government in the suppression of Arab disorder they will take the law into their own hands. Apart from what he may feel as to the ethics of the case, he knows well that politically any such action on the^part of the Jews would be disastrous to the cause which he has at heart. The other reason is that he fears Jews will be-caught carrying arms and will thus be tried by the military courts, with a pro-bable death penalty. The Jewish Hagana is strong in numbers and well armed. Whilst outwardly applauding the institution of military courts and the enhanced punishments thereunder, Shertok told me that such a measure would be &apos;&apos; fraught with danger to our people,&quot; thereby implying that Jews, more than Arabs, would be likely to be caught carrying arms. Rutenberg the reputed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Hagana also made a similar remark to me. I do not think, however, that Shertok&apos;s proposals will help to solve the security problem, and I am not adopting them.The second solution which has been pressed upon me by Shertok, Ben Zvi and Rutenberg is that the security problem should be settled by a political solution. The first two named have rather dropped this recently, but Rutenberg is certain that he can solve the problem in his own way. Last week Rutenberg came to see me, and offered, provided I authorised him to do so, to sound the Amir Abdullah and Ragheb Bey Nashashibi and other Arabs with regard to their co-operation in political matters with certain Jews, one of whom he mentioned was Shertok. I thanked him for his offer, but said I was unable to accept it at the present time. Now a political solution and co-operation on the lines proposed by Rutenberg can mean nothing more than a hole and corner intrigue with money passing hands. I see no reason to lend the weight of Government to a proceeding of that kind, especially as I do not think any lasting good would come of it. Neither Ragheb Bey nor the Amir are in a position to sound a clarion call to Palestinian Arabs a1&quot;, present. Co-operation in the meaning of the word as we know it is impossible at present. I fear that Ragheb Bey is as unstable as mercury, and what is more he lacks what Kipling called &quot; essential guts.&quot; I am most disappointed in him. I saw him this week and he did not have the courage to issue a simple statement on behalf of his party that he deplored assassinations. His influence in the country is slight. He chatters too much, gloats in public over the discomfiture of the Mufti, and thinks that he will come out on top in the end. He is such a fool that he expects the Government to pull his nuts out of the fire by allowing him to publish proclamations and manifestos blackguarding the Government so that he can regain his prestige with the Arabs. He has no moral character or backbone. It is a great pity, especially as he is such a charming rascal and exceedingly good company and popular socially with many Englishmen.The Amir is suspect and carries no weight in Palestine at the moment. His idea as expressed to me with some warmth the other day is &quot;to do something [16207] b 2
politically.&quot; I was not favoured1 with his views of exactly what he would do. He is at the moment a broken reed, I fear.So I have had to reject both the proposals for dealing with the security situation put forward by Jews.T now turn to what I think has been accomplished in the way of security. I think some advance has been made in spite of our daily tale of shootings and bombings. There are bound to be setbacks such as occurred last week, when six persons were killed in Jerusalem between the hours of 7 aim. and 8-30 a.m.(i) The North has been noticeably quiet for the past six weeks and this in spite of the fact that two known gangs have been wandering in those parts. I attribute this to the activity of all the local officials and the Army, to the fact that the frontier force has settled down to its work, to the improvement of arrangements at frontier controls, to the stationing of troops at Tiberias, to the stern and immediate punishment meted out to villages known to have harboured or helped gangs, and to French help in Syria. All this has helped to make our Northern frontier less of a problem and anxiety than it was. Individual gangsters will always be able to get through our long frontiers, but I do not believe that any large gangs can do so unobserved. I also believe that no gang can now be formed in the North without reasonably timely information being received about it. I do not mean to suggest that we are not likely to have outrages in the North indeed, I shall be very surprised if this does not happen. But the fact that what has always been looked upon as the chief danger point in Palestine has been kept so quiet while trouble has been brewing in the South is something to the credit side. We should have been hard put to it if we had had to deal with disturbances both in the North and in the South simultaneously. There is a little comfort to be derived from the fact the people in Syria have desired to promote a rebellion in Palestine, but have only succeeded in stirring up trouble in and around Jerusalem.(ii) Information, though still far from what is required, is coming in better than it did.(hi) Gangsters are demanding more pay than they did. I have just received thoroughly reliable information from Syria that the price for gangsters has risen by 100 per cent., and that these men also demand that their lives shall be insured to provide for their families should they be killed.(iv) The bulk of the Arab population as a whole want to get back to normal conditions, because of the adverse economic effects of lack of security; for fear of collective punishment following the lawless acts of a few individuals; because they are becoming disillusioned as to the political value of outrages and rebellion; and from the certain belief that Government will continue to take stern measures against anyone carrying out or passively assisting in disturbances of the peace.(v) The present trend of public opinion is towards co-operation with Government in anything connected with everyday administration. It must not be assumed from this that the Government and its policy in regard to partition are any more popular than in the past. The feeling amongst the Moslem towns-people is as strong as ever, but is not being given public expression; the Christians view the prospect of being included in an Arab or in a Jewish State with equal apprehension, and in their hearts they pray for a continuation of British control, but they cannot be expected to demonstrate their feelings openly when they have been told that the Mandate is to be brought to an end. The fellahin are worried and unsettled about the future.(vi) There are some very faint signs that some Moslems definitely and openly wish the present state of things to cease. For example, the Gaza Ulemas, without any prompting, issued a manifesto deploring assassinations. This is going a long way for them. The notables in Jaffa, though not so open as the Ulemas of Gaza, are insistent for peace.(vii) The morale of the British service is high, and the morale of the Arab police is, I am assured, better than it was. The Arab police have, indeed, done some good work. But I am not prepared to trust them as a body and I doubt if we ever shall be able to do so. The strain, particularly on the Police Force, has been great and it is telling.(viii) The influence of the Mufti has definitely waned in Palestine, though the fear that he may come back still operates in that some Arabs, who would otherwise be willing to give us information and help, still fear to do so. Some villagers believe that they have been exploited and then abandoned by the so-called
leaders. Outside Palestine the Mufti&apos;s stock is low. He is, in certain circles, looked upon as a coward for having run away; and as he no longer has large sums of money nor any patronage at his command he has much less influence. His personal prestige is not improved by his irritability and his habit of petulantly blaming Arabs in other countries for not doing more on his behalf. He appears to have been firmly of the conviction that his Hegira would be the sign for a general uprising in neighbouring Arab countries on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs. If he can be insulated from major politics as he is now for another year or so he will only have a nuisance value and that a pretty low one.The credit side of this account is not so good as one might have hoped, but something may be added thereto by the institution of Military Courts. The near future will tell whether the moral effect will be as high as some are inclined to think it will be. I have little doubt that if there are a few summary convictions the effect will be good.I dealt with some of the details of the immediate local political problem in my secret letter of the 17th November, and will not repeat them here except to say that from the recent interviews I have had this week I am confirmed in my opinion that the Arabs still believe that they are justified in carrying on this campaign of violence and unrest, and that they think it will have the effect of inducing His Majesty&apos;s Government to deviate from its expressed policy. I doubt whether any Arab really has any ethical feeling against murder, and I am sure Arabs look upon murder as a justifiable and satisfactory weapon to use not only in private feuds but in political controversies. We shall never get them to change their fundamental beliefs on Ihis point and so our only hope is to make murder and disturbances as unpleasant and expensive for them as possible, or, in a word, make them see that it does not pay. Then they will stop. One of the methods by which they can be made to see that murder will not deflect His Majesty&apos;s Government from its decisions will be the appointment of the new Commission; and although there are risks involved in this action, I think it will be wise indeed, that it is essential to take these risks.I have no doubt that much mud will be thrown at this Government at Geneva and elsewhere at the repressive measures which have had to be taken. I frankly admit that they are most repressive, and I think they are as distasteful to the rest of the Service as they are to me. But I am satisfied that such measures were and are still essential for the prevention of anarchy; and I fear the time has not yet come when these drastic measures can be dropped as an instrument of Government.Yours sincerely.W. D. BATTERSHILL.
