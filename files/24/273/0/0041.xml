THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1937.MOST SECRET.Copy No.   47CP. 316 (37).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE IN FUTURE YEARS.Interim Report by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I. Introductory.1. ON the 30th June the Cabinet approved generally the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. 165 (37) inviting the Defence Depart-ments and the Air Raid Precautions Department of the Home Office, in consultation with me, to submit returns (1) Estimating anew the period of time required for the completion of these programmes;(2) On the basis of the programmes as now sanctioned and of the rising trend of prices, to submit estimates of their total requirements of voted money year by year during that period; and(3) On the like basis, to submit estimates of their normal total annual expenditure in the years following completion of the programme.2. The returns asked for were circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 256 (37). The Chancellor of the Exchequer at the same time circulated a memorandum summarising the salient features of the position disclosed by these returns, together with some observations of a general character on the increase in the cost of modern armaments (CP. 257 (37) ).3. These two Papers were considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 27th October.The Cabinet agreed : (a) To refer the papers CP. 256 (37) and CP. 257 (37) for a full reportcontaining his recommendations, to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, who would consider them in consultation with representa--tives of the Treasury and such others as he may from time to time invite, including political Ministers specially concerned;(b) That the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should have discretion tosend interim reports to the Cabinet on matters of special urgency.4. I have held a number of meetings with the Defence Ministers and their advisers, and with representatives of the Treasury. The papers considered and discussed at these meetings have included, in addition to CP. 256 and 257 (37) : (1) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air on the strength of the Royal Air Force and Air Defence : (DP. (P) 12).*(2) A note by the Treasury dealing with the financial aspects of the Defence Programmes, and, in particular, with the sums which it is reasonable to assume can be made available for Defence, in the years up to 1942, and thereafter.Copies of this paper and of D.P. (P) 3, referred to later, are -boing eir
5. In the course of these discussions I invited the Defence Departments to submit further information on a number of matters, and also called for revised estimates of cost on alternative bases, to those on which the forecasts summarised in CP. 256 (37) are compiled. The information thus supplied has been utilised in drawing up this report.II. The Defence Programmes and our Available Resources.6. As explained in CP. 165 (37), this review was set on foot as a result of a study undertaken by the Prime Minister, in the concluding weeks of his Chancellorship, of the Defence Programmes as a Avhole, present and prospective, in terms of our resources. It is desirable to state at the outset what is involved in the statement that our Defence Programmes must be related to our total available resources.7. In considering whether we can afford this or that programme, the first question asked is how much the programme will cost; and the cost of the programme is then related to the sums which can be made available from Exchequer resources, from taxation, or exceptionally from the pioceeds of loans. But the fact that the problem is considered in terms of money, must not be allowed to obscure the fact that our real resources consist not of money, i.e., paper pounds which are nothing more than a symbol, but of our man power, and productive capacity, our power to maintain our credit, and the general balance of our trade.8. Owing to its shortage of native raw materials and foodstuffs, this country is particularly dependent upon imports which have to be paid for and can only be paid for if the volume of our export trade is not impaired. This factor of the general balance of our trade is closely connected with our credit. The amount of money which we can borrow without inflation is mainly dependent upon two factors : the savings of the country as a whole which are available for investment, and the maintenance of confidence in our financial stability. But these savings would be reduced and confidence would at once be weakened by airy substantial disturbance of the general balance of trade. While if we were to raise sums in excess of the sums available in the market, the result would be inflation;.i.e., a general rise in prices which would have an immediate effect upon our export trade.9. The maintenance of credit facilities and our general balance of trade are of vital importance, not merely from the point of view of our strength in peace time, but equally for purposes of war. This country cannot hope to wivi a war against a major Power by a sudden knock-out blow : on the contrary, for success we must contemplate a long war, in the course of which we should have to mobilise all our resources and those of the Dominions and other countries overseas. This is no new conception. The report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on Planning for a War with Germany (DP. (P) 2) was based on the general conception that Germany is likely to be the aggressor and will endeavour &quot; to exploit her superior preparedness by trying to knock out Great Britain rapidly, or to knock out France rapidly, since she is not well placed for a long war in which the Sea Powers, as in the past, are likely to have the advantage.&quot; We must therefore confront our potential enemies with the risks of a long war, which they cannot face. If we are to emerge victoriously from such a war, it is essential that we should enter it with sufficient economic strength to enable us to make the fullest uses of resources overseas, and to withstand the strain.10. While, therefore, it is true that the extent of our resources imposes limitations upon the size of the defence programmes which we are able to under-take, this is only one aspect of the. matter. Seen in its true perspective, the maintenance of our economic stability would more accurately be described as an essential element in our defensive strength : one which can properly be regarded as a fourth arm in defence, alongside the three Defence Services, without which purely military effort wouid be of no avail.11. Important as these considerations are, there is another and no less powerful reason why we should avoid at all costs any action at the present time
III. The Cost of the Present Programmes and the Sums available for defence.Expenditure on Defence.15. The Memorandum circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer dated 22nd October (CP. 257/37) contained a general summary (Table III on page 8) showing the cost of the Defence Programmes for the two five-year periods 1937-41 and 1942-46, on two alternative hypotheses, &quot;A&quot; and &quot; B.&quot; Hypothesis A corresponds very broadly with the existing approved programmes, while Hypothesis - B represents the existing approved programmes with certain important additions, of which the chief are : (1) in the case of the Navy the proposed New Standard of Naval Strength set out in Admiralty Memorandum D.P. (P) 3;(2) in the case of the Royal Air Force, a new scheme J, which would substantially increase our first-line strength. This scheme has been explained in Air Ministry Memorandum D.P. (P) 12.16. For convenience of reference this table is reproduced as an Appendix. For present purposes the most important figures are as follows : Period 1937-41.The total expenditure on defence (including defence expenditure borne on Civil Votes) is put at  1,605 millions under hypothesis A and  1,884 millions under hypothesis B.These figures compare with the total of  1,500 millions given in the statement on Defence issued in February 1937 (Cmd. 5374) as the total expenditure contemplated over this period.Period 1942-46.The total expenditure on defence on the same basis is put at  1,282 millions under hypothesis A, and at  1,617 millions under hypothesis B.which would affect our stability. Nothing operates more strongly to deter a potential aggressor from attacking this country than our stability, and the power which this nation has so often shown of overcoming its difficulties without violent change, and without damage to its inherent strength. This reputation stands us in good stead, and causes other countries to rate our powers of resistance at something far more formidable than is implied merely by the number of men of war. aeroplanes and battalions which we should have at our disposal immediately on the outbreak of war. But were other countries to detect in us signs of strain, this deterrent would at once be lost.12. These considerations are of the first importance, but there are others which must be taken into account. The whole trend of modern armaments is in the direction of reliance on mechanised forces, capable of dealing a knock-out blow in a few weeks or months. If our superior staying-power is to be brought to bear to bring us victory in war, we must maintain forces strong enough to ensure us against defeat by a sudden blow.13. Not only must we be strong enough to withstand a knock-out blow, but we must be seen to be strong. So long as our armaments are believed to be below the level of safety, our all-important influence for the maintenance of peace will suffer, and we shall be liable to successive rebuffs which will reduce that influence still further. Indeed, so far as there has been any improvement in the inter-national situation within recent times, it is largely due to our rearmament. In the interests of peace we cannot afford that an impression should grow up that we are relaxing our efforts.14. The problem before the Cabinet is, therefore, to strike a proper balance between these factors, and to determine the size and character of the forces which will suffice to ward off defeat in the early&quot; days of war, and will enable us to exercise our rightful influence for peace, without making demands on our resources which would impair our stability, and our staying power in peace and war.
17. These figures include, of course, not only maintenance costs, but also non-recurrent expenditure on bringing the Defence Forces up to the new-standards implied in the Programmes. A forecast has also been given of the average annual sum required for maintenance after completion of the programmes. This is put at  255 millions under hypothesis A and  301 millions under hypothesis B, for all three Defence Services.18. The Defence Departments, in submitting these forecasts, emphasised that they were based on a survey of the whole field of expenditure, and that the figures were, at the best, very rough approximations on the best data available. They appended to their forecasts lists of additional items for which they might seek authority to incur expenditure at a later date. The cost of these additional items has been taken into account in the total figures given in the preceding paragraphs. But it became evident during discussions with Defence Ministers that no provision, or inadequate provision, had been made for a number of possible additions to the programmes which must be regarded as likely to mature.19. One is that the Army have included provision of  15 millions only for the expansion of the present approved scheme for the Air Defence of Great Britain, this sum covering :  (1) Guns for defence against low-flying attack ( 6 millions). (2) The extension of A.D.G.B. northwards ( 4 millions). (3) Increased ammunition and lorries ( 5 millions).If, however, effect were given to the full &quot; Ideal&quot; scheme for improving A.D.G.B. the additional cost (including all these three items) would probably be about  46 millions.*20.   Again, in regard to the Royal Air Force, no provision is included in the figures of cost of Scheme J for the cost of increasing war potential.21. It was stated in the White Paper on Defence, issued in March 1936 [Cmd. 5107], that the whole defence programme must remain flexible; and it is clearly necessary that new needs, which reveal themselves as the programme proceeds, must be dealt with on their merits and cannot be ignored merely because they were not included in the initial estimates of cost. Hitherto, however, the procedure followed has been that additions have been made to the programme without, speaking broadly, any attempt to find countervailing economies, and it is evident that if this procedure is continued (and the instances given in the preceding paragraphs are evidence that it is still continuing), the ultimate expenditure on defence will be substantially in excess of any of the total figures already quoted.Sums available for defence.22.   The evidence given by the Treasury can here be summarised under two heads : (a) the total amount of money which can be made available for defence in thefive years 1937-41;(b) the sum which it is reasonable to regard as available for defence annuallyfrom 1942 onwards.The position up to March 1942.23. In the statement on defence issued in February 1937 (Cmd. 5374), the i total expenditure on Defence over this period was estimated at  1,500 millions. j\ This was a round figure, impressive in magnitude, which represented the sum* In the summary of the forecasts of Defence Expenditure in future years submitted to the Cabinet in October last (CP. 256/37-), it was stated that among the possible additions to the Programme envisaged by the War Office were proposals designed to improve recruiting. (Footnote on page 5.) Proposals to this&apos; end have now been submitted to the Treasury by the Secretary of State for War. The ultimate annual recurrent cost of these proposals (excluding substantial capital expenditure on additional married quarters) is estimated at  6 millions a year plus a further sum for improvements in the conditions of service of Regular officers. These figures do not include the cost of repercussions on the other two Defence Services. The effect of these proposals, if accepted, has not been taken into account in the figures given in this report of the total defence expenditure over the next 5 years, or of permanent maintenance costs thereafter.
o289which might be expected to be absorbed by the programme as it stood, after making a substantial allowance for such additions as might be found necessary as the work developed. Mr. Chamberlain, when Chancellor, considered in the Spring of this year that some  1,100 millions (or an average of  220 millions a year) could be found out of Revenue over this period, for defence, and borrowing powers were obtained for the balance up to  400 millions.24. On present information there is no reason, in the Treasury view, to alter the view that, on the average  220 millions a year can be found from Revenue for defence over the 5 years 1937 to 1941. But the present position in regard to borrowing is now more difficult than in the Spring. If it were decided that it was necessary to spend substantially more than  1,500 millions on defence over this period of years, it would probably be found necessary that the excess should be found by an increase in the level of taxation, rather than by increasing the total sum made available for defence from borrowed money above  400 millions.The position after March 1942.25. In his note of June last (CP. 165 (37)), the Chancellor of the Exchequer wrote that, even in favourable circumstances, it would be most unwise to assume that more than  150- 170 millions would be available for defence annually after the end of the year 1941-42. The enormous gap between this figure and the future cost of even hypothesis A has led .to a further review of this matter, in which account has been taken of the recent statement of the Prime Minister at Scarborough, in which he referred to the impossibility of undertaking any costly new services in the Civil sphere while this burden was upon us.26. The Treasury have emphasised the impossibility of predicting the revenue in a given year, five years hence, except upon given assumptions as to trade and other governing conditions; and they have pointed out that the difference between the yield of taxation in an exceptionally good year, and a year of severe depression (though not so grave a catastrophe as befell us in 1931), might amount to over  100 millions a year. It is therefore necessary to approach the matter by consideration of the average expectation of taxation (excluding only the temporary National Defence Contribution), assuming the maintenance of the present rates of taxation. On this basis, the highest figure which it would be reasonable on present indications to envisage as likely to be available for defence on average year by year after 1942 is  200 millions. This allows  30 millions sinking fund for the National Debt of over  7,000 millions, which the Treasury regard as an absolute minimum provision, it being remembered that by 1942 the sinking fund will have been suspended for over 10 years.27. The main facts which emerge from this survey may be summarised as follows : If we work on the basis of hypothesis A (i.e., the lower of the two hypotheses submitted by the Defence Departments), but ignore for the moment the lists of additional items, and other probable additions to the programmes, the total expenditure on Defence would be of manageable proportions up to March 1942, but would be substantially in excess of the sum likely to be available on average for defence thereafter.28. If, however, we take into account the increases asked for by Depart-ments over and above hypothesis A, some, at least, of which are of high priority, the total defence expenditure up to March 1942 will clearly be considerably in excess of the sums which we can find; while the position thereafter will reveal an even greater gap between the amount available for defence and the total defence bill.  All this, of course, applies with still greater force to hypothesis B.29. Further, the practice of envisaging the problem in two periods (the period up to March 1942 and the period thereafter) obscures one essential factor in the position. When the Defence programmes were launched, it was contem-plated that, while it would be necessary to spend very considerable sums on defence in the ensuing five years, in order to make good deficiencies, the expenditure would then fall to a much lower level. It was for this reason that it was decided that circumstances justified borrowing over a quarter of the total probable expenditure on defence over the period covered by the programmes, and it was on these grounds that the Defence Loans Act was justified to Parliament.j
30. But it is now clear that the permanent costs of maintenance of the Services, on completion of the present programmes, will be immeasurably higher than was contemplated when the programmes were launched,* and that if we proceed as at present, we are in grave danger of building up the Defence Forces out of borrowed money to a level which is beyond our power to maintain. Such a situation was never contemplated when the programmes were authorised by Cabinet.31. The best estimate of the whole position which can be given is that, on the basis of the present level of taxation, and bearing in mind the heavy annual maintenance costs which will result in future years when the extended programmes now proposed have been completed, every effort must be made to bring the total defence expenditure over the 5 years 1937-41 within the total of  1,500 millions. If, however, the immediate international situation should be judged so serious as to involve expenditure above this figure, the excess can only be met by heavy increases in taxation, since the greater part of our civil expenditure results automatically from social legislation, the benefits of which cannot in fact be reduced, except at a time of grave financial emergency, and then only with serious political consequences. Further, any excess over  1,500 millions in the total defence expenditure in the 5-year period 1937-41, almost certainly represents expenditure on building up our forces with the help of borrowed money to a level which we cannot maintain, except by imposing a grievous burden of additional taxation.32. Not only are the programmes as they now stand both as hypothesis A. and still more as hypothesis B more extensive and more costly than the programmes originally authorised, but with the addition of new items the balance of the original scheme has been largely destroyed; while circumstances have changed materially since the Defence Requirements Committee drew up the plan on which the present programmes are based.33. The broad conclusion to be drawn from this summary is that it is necessary to take under review the whole range of the Defence Programmes, in order to determine which items are essential and which items are of lower priority, and can be postponed, curtailed or dispensed with. The ensuing section of this memorandum sets out the principles of policy on which such a review should be based.34. It may be appropriate, however, at this stage to make some reference to the underlying causes of the very large increases now proposed in Defence expenditure. Two main factors are responsible for this increase. The first is the increasing elaborateness, and therefore expensiveness, of modern armaments. This phenomenon was illustrated by the Appendices to the Chancellors Paper (CP. 257/36).35. It is clear that nothing which we can do can counteract this general tendency. But this is not to say that we are powerless to prevent each and every costly increase in the programme due to the invention of some new device or improvement in existing armaments. Indeed, I believe that substantial sums could be saved and that our difficulties in financing the Defence Programme would be considerably reduced if the Defence Departments were to devote more attention to ensuring that the articles put into production are not only efficient, but have been designed with a view to economical manufacture.36. It is a commonplace that in time of war it is often impossible to obtain the best possible article and that something short of perfection has co be accepted in order to obtain delivery of the number of articles required within the time available. Unless Departments pay the utmost attention to this matter, I do not think that we shall obtain the best- value from the resources which can be made available for defence.* At the time of the 3rd report of the Defence Requirement Committee (D.E.C. 37), dated November 1935, it was estimated that by 1941 the net increase&quot;, over the 1935 Estimate provision, in recurrent annual charges arising from the Committee&apos;s proposals, but excluding Naval Construction, would amount to  16,320,000 a year. The total of (original) Defence Estimates for 1935 was  124,250,000. These figures should be compared with the forecast of the average annual sums required for maintenance^ after completion of the programmes given in Table III of CP. 257 (37) which is reproduced as an appendix to this report.
37. The other factor concerns the assumptions made by the Defence Departments as to the potential enemies against whom we must make defence preparations. This matter has been referred to in recent papers submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office, and its importance is, of course, already fully recognised. From the point of view of the present report, however, it must be clearly stated that in the long run the provision of adequate defences within the means at our disposal will only be achieved when our long-term foreign policy has succeeded in changing the present assumptions as to our potential enemies.IV. The Policy on which the Defence Programmes should be based.38. The summary given in the preceding section has led me to the conclusion that it is necessary to review the whole range of the Defence Programmes in order to determine which items have the first claim to early completion, and what items must, if need be, be excluded, or at least postponed.39. Such a review clearly implies a single policy governing the programmes of all three Defence Departments, and of the Civil Departments concerned with defence matters.40. This policy must be based on the existing international situation, though it should take into account the changes in that situation which it is reasonable to expect, and those changes which it should be the aim of our foreign policy to bring about.41. The corner stone of our Imperial Defence Policy is to maintain the security of the United Kingdom. Our main strength lies in the resources of man power, productive capacity and the powers of endurance possessed by this country. Unless these can be maintained substantially unimpaired, not only in peace but particularly in the early stages of a war, when they will be subject to continuous attacks, our ultimate defeat in a major war would be certain, irrespective of what might happen in other and secondary spheres.42. It follows that our first and main effort must be directed to two principal objectives, namely, to protecting this country against attack, and to preserving the trade routes on which we depend for essential imports of food and raw material.43. Our third objective is the maintenance of forces for the defence of British territories overseas, against attack by sea, land or air. One of the main features which distinguishes our defence problems from those of certain Continental countries is that we require not only to maintain in peace garrisons and defences at naval bases and other strategic points throughout the world, but also to have available at all times forces for despatch overseas for the performance of what may be described as Imperial Police duties. It is obvious that in time of war the demands for reinforcements of our peace-time Imperial garrisons might well be very considerable. At the same time, the strength of the forces available for such reinforcement is not a matter of such vital importance as the defence of this country, since so long as this country remains undefeated we may hope in time to repair any losses or defeats suffered elsewhere.44. Our fourth objective, which can only be provided after the other objectives have been met, is co-operation in the defence of the territories of any allies we may have in war.45. I deal in the ensuing section with the detailed application of this policy to the programmes of the three Services. It is clear, however, that, if this policy is adopted, and the survival of Great Britain herself is accepted as the primary condition of success, the greatest danger against which we have to provide protection is attack from the air on the United Kingdom, designed to inflict a knock-out blow at the initial stage of the war, and that our first endeavour must be to provide adequate defence against this threat.
V. Application of this Policy to the Defence Programmes. Introductory.47. To complete the task assigned to me by the Cabinet, it is obviously necessary that the Defence Departments should be invited to submit revised forecasts of the cost of their programmes, if the basis of the policy outlined in the preceding paragraphs is approved. These revised forecasts, together with the forecasts of defence expenditure borne on civil votes, must then be considered in relation to the conclusion set out in paragraph 31, that, if we are to avoid heavy increases in taxation and permanent annual defence maintenance expendi-ture after 1942 substantially in excess of any sum which we can make available for defence purposes, every effort must be made to bring the total defence expenditure within the 5 years 1937-41 within a total of  1,500 millions.48. The War Office have already been asked to furnish particulars of costs on the basis that the primary role of the Regular Army becomes the defence of Imperial commitments including anti-aircraft defence at home, rather than what I may call the Continental role, but I understand that some little time must elapse before these particulars can be completed. Further information must likewise be obtained from the other two Defence Departments.49. In the meantime it is clearly desirable that I should not await the results of these enquiries before I report to my colleagues the broad conclusions which I have reached in the course of my enquiry. Further, the Defence Depart-ments are at present actively engaged in the preparation of their Estimates for the financial year 1938, and much inconvenience will result if there should be any substantial delay in reaching decisions on the main issues which have been raised in the course of this review.50. This section of my report therefore sets out the detailed application of the policy now proposed, to each of the Defence Services, and indicates the points on which I require further information for the completion of my task. In the concluding section, I summarise the main issues raised, and I invite my colleagues to reach decisions of principle in regard to them, on the understanding that I shall at a later date submit a further report when I have obtained the necessary further particulars from the Defence Departments.Navy.51. The present programmes, referred to as the D.R.C. Fleet, are based on the following formula : &apos;&apos; We should be able to send to the Far East a Fleet sufficient to provide &apos; cover &apos; against the Japanese Fleet: we should have sufficient additional forces behind this shield for the protection of our territory and mercantile marine against Japanese attack : at the same time we should be able to retain in European waters a force sufficient to act as a deterrent and to prevent the strongest European Naval Power from obtaining control of our vital Home terminal areas while we can make the necessary redispositions.&quot; (N.C.M. (35) 12.)This formula is in effect an adaptation, adopted in 1932, of the one-Power standard limitation which we accepted in the Treaties which expired at the end of 1936. The programmes, which are due to be completed in 1940, provide in the main for the replacement of over-age and out-of-date ships and deficiencies, including modernisation and ammunition reserves.52. Reviewing the changed circumstances at the end of 1935, the D.R. Committee recommended that we should aim at an increased standard of naval strength adequate to protect our interests simultaneously against Japan in the Far East and Germany in Europe. At that time the revival of Germany&apos;s naval power had begun, though her strength is limited by agreement to 35 per cent, of ours, and the apprehension was felt that if war came either in the Far East or the West, it would extend to, the. other theatre as well. The grounds for this apprehension have, I think, been increasing recently.53. When the question of the new standard came before the Cabinet in February 1936, it would not have been possible owing to limitations of industrial
capacity and personnel to take any considerable steps towards its attainment during the next three years, and the Cabinet postponed a decision, instructing the Admiralty to work out the programmes required to give effect to the new standard as soon as the necessary data were available.54. In D.P. (P.) 3, the Admiralty put forward their detailed proposals.. Their new standard Fleet includes an increase in all classes of ships and personnel; the additional programmes would be completed in 1944. The basic assumption amounts to readiness for simultaneous war with Germany and Japan. It takes no account of the possibility of Italy being hostile also, nor conversely of any assistance which might be forthcoming from France or other allies. The Admiralty have set out certain reductions which might be feasible consequent upon political agreements being reached with Germany and Japan respectively.55. The calculations assume the limitation of the German Fleet to 35 per cent, of our own. It seems unwise to count on this assumption holding indefinitely.56. It would, of course, be an advantage to the Admiralty to have an early decision on the ultimate size of the Fleet for the purpose, not only of planning their future strength, but of regulating the intake of personnel. I understand that the rate of intake of personnel proposed for 1938 is somewhat in excess of the number required for the D.R.C. Fleet, but that this small excess could be adjusted in the ensuing year. As regards New Construction, I understand that the Admiralty&apos;s proposals for 1938-39 do not exceed the D.R.C. standard except as regards one destroyer flotilla and three submarines, which would probably not be laid down until the end of the financial year. On battleship construction the main decision whether to exceed the D.R.C. standard would arise in 1940.57. I think it must be accepted that1 any decision to increase our naval strength beyond the D.R.C. Fleet must be taken before the 1939 Programme. Other reasons apart, the Admiralty inform me that they are committed to giving Germany a notice of any such intention during 1938: For the time being, however, it is possible, for the Admiralty to proceed broadly on the basis of the D.R.C. Fleet without prejudice to the adoption at a later date of the proposed new standard, should a decision subsequently be given to this effect. This enables us to defer for the time being a decision on a matter which would have such far-reaching consequences. I propose, therefore, that for the present the Admiralty should not incur expenditure which commits them to a fleet beyond the D.R.C. standard.58. The Admiralty have, however, represented to me that, &apos;&apos; unless a complete change takes place in the international situation, the D.R.C. fleet .... in no way represents the realities of the position. One of the features, for example, of the D.R.C. programme is that it would involve eventually the premature scrapping of ships which have now been, or are being, modernised.&quot;59. T am asking the Admiralty to consider what modified proposals they wish to suggest to deal with this point, even though it may involve some departure from the D.R.C. standard.  I hope to deal with these proposals in my next report.60. An alternative course would have been for me to invite the Admiralty to submit proposals for a fleet intermediate between the D.R.C. fleet and the proposed new standard fleet. 1 reached the conclusion, however, that the course set out in the preceding paragraph is preferable.A rmy.61. A.D.G.B. In accordance with the principle that the greatest danger against which we have to provide protection is attack from the air, the Army should give first priority to the provision of anti-aircraft defences. A decision has already been reached that absolute priority should be given by the War Office to the provision of anti-aircraft defences over other forms of war material : (meeting held in the Prime Minister&apos;s room on the 8th November, 1937*); but this decision related to the acceleration of the completion of the present authorised programme.* C.I.D. Paper No. 271-A; taken note of by the C.I.D. on the 16th December, 1937.
From the point of view of the present review, it is necessary to consider whether that programme is adequate. On the basis of the policy discussed in this report we cannot afford half-measures in a matter so vital to the protection of this country, and we must accept the position that the present programme must be substantially enlarged, both as regards the area to be covered and the degree of protection to be afforded.62. The plan for the expansion of the present scheme is known as the 1&apos; Ideal &apos;&apos; scheme. I should, however, remind my colleagues that when the scheme eame before the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 17th June, 1937, they endorsed the view of the Home Defence Committee, that the scheme is by no means an over-insurance. The full additional capital cost is estimated at  46 millions, including a considerable increase in the number of guns for defence against low-flying attack.63. In this plan the additions to the ground defences have been worked out in a definite order. The first two stages provide for the extension of the lighted zone northwards to include the defences of the Tyne, and for the provision of local defences for the Forth and Clyde. These latter areas are at present wholly unprovided with A.A. defences.64. In my view an examination of the next practicable stages of expansion, from the aspects of personnel and production, is necessary. This is being under-taken, and I shall be in a position to deal with this matter, including the financial commitments, in my next Report. In the meantime I consider that we should accept forthwith the northward extension of A.D.G.B. as regards both the increased number of fighter squadrons required for the additional area and the ground defences of A.A. guns and searchlights.Coast Defences.65. The Third Report of the Defence Requirements Committee contained a recommendation whereby fixed annual allotments were assigned for the various groups of ports, e.g., Home Ports, Ports East of Suez other than Singapore, and Ports on the Mediterranean and Cape Routes.66. The Defence Departments have represented that these allotments only permit of very slow progress, and have asked that they should be substantially increased over the next 3 years, with a view to completion of the more urgent items by 1940-41. Authority was given for increased expenditure in the current financial year, but the question of an increased rate of allotment for future years has been deferred pending this review.67. I recognise that this work can only be carried out efficiently and economically on the basis of a long-term programme extending two or three years ahead. I propose to deal with this matter in my next report when the Defence Departments have submitted the further particulars now asked for, showing the cost of the programmes as a whole on the basis of the policy outlined in this report.Regular Army.68. On the basis of the policy now proposed, the Continental hypothesis ranks fourth in order of priority and the primary role of the Regular Army becomes the defence of Imperial commitments, including anti-aircraft defence at home.69. This definition in the role of the Army is put forward by reason of the increasing demands made on our man power and industrial resources by the risk of air attack which necessitates increases in the Air Force and in the Air Defence of Great Britain. It. may be noted, however, that a number of recent events have occurred which go far to justify this change in policy. Thus it has, I understand, been suggested that France no longer looks to us in the event of war to supply an expeditionary force on the scale hitherto proposed in addition to our all-important co-operation on the sea and in the air.70. Secondly, Germany has guaranteed the inviolability and integrity of Belgian territory, and there seems good reason for thinking that it would be in Germany&apos;s interests to -honour this agreement.
71. Thirdly, external events have conspired to increase the probable demands on our forces in respect of our Imperial commitments overseas, and to render it possible that in a major war they would go far to absorb our military resources.72. The inclusion in our defence plans of the provision of 1 contingent of the Field Force consisting of 4 divisions and 1 mobile division, capable of sustaining a part in continental warfare from the outbreak of war, necessitates the accumulation in peace time of very large reserves of equipment and material, and the maintenance of a * considerable war potential. If the employment of the Army outside this country is to be related to the defence of Imperial commitments, the Regular Army will, of course, still require to be re-equipped with modern armaments. But it should be possible to effect a very substantial reduction in the scale of reserves and some reduction may also be found possible in the provision of tanks, especially of the heavier calibres.73. It is, of course, impossible to foretell in what part of the world the Regular Army might be called upon to fight in defence of Imperial interests. But it seems reasonable to assume that the operations involved are unlikely to be waged with the sustained intensity or on the scale to be expected in the case of operations on the Continent.74. This change in the role of the Army is put forward in conformity with the general policy outlined in this report, namely, that our main effort must be directed to the protection of this country against attack and the preservation of our trade routes, and that for ultimate success we look to our staying power and our capacity to mobilise our resources. On the basis of this policy, the increasing demands on our resources made by the Air and the Navy clearly have prior claim.75. I must, however, warn my colleagues of the possible consequences of this proposal in order that they may share my responsibility for the decision to be taken with their eyes open. Notwithstanding recent developments in mechanised warfare on land and in the air; there is no sign of the displacement of infantry. If France were again to be in danger of being overrun by land armies, a situation might arise when, as in the last war, we had to improvise an army to assist her. Should this happen, the Government of the day would most certainly be criticised for having neglected to provide against so obvious a contingency. Nevertheless, for the reasons indicated, I am of opinion that there is no alternative but to adopt the more limited role of the Army envisaged in this report.Territorial Army.76. The Defence Requirements Committee in their Third Report proposed that the Regular Army should be supported by three contingents of the Territorial Army, each of 4 divisions, fully equipped on a modern scale, and able to proceed overseas 4, 6 and 8 months respectively after the outbreak of war.77. This recommendation was not endorsed by the Cabinet who decided that the&apos; decision as to whether and when the proposals for reconditioning the Territorial Force can be implemented should be reserved for 3 years, or until such time as the industrial situation of the country and its capacity for output brought this proposal within the range of actual possibilities.78. There has since been considerable discussion as to the role of the Territorial Army. Hitherto conditions of output have operated to prevent any substantial expenditure on reconditioning the force. The Cabinet, however, agreed in principle in May last that the Territorial Army should receive sufficient equipment of the same type as the Regular Army to enable the whole 12 Territorial Divisions to be trained in peace at an estimated cost of  9^ millions.79. The policy now proposed would affect the role of the Territorial Army in the three following ways :  (i) First, the extension of the Air Defence of Great Britain would result in the conversion of further Territorial Divisions to AA. Divisions. The establishment of the existing AA. Divisions is far greater than that of the normal Territorial Divisions, and it is a matter for consideration whether, if further A.A. units are required, the conversion should proceed on the same basis as in the past, or whether
(three oi*) four Territorial Divisions might not be converted to two new A.A. Divisions. It should also be a matter for consideration whether existing Territorial units should be converted to undertake defence against low-flying attack.(ii) The scale of air attack now envisaged on this country might well result in the dislocation of essential services, or in some loss of morale in crowded areas. There is also the problem of evacuation to be considered. Certain Territorial units might, therefore, be earmarked for duties in connection with the maintenance of order and of essential services in this country in time of war.(iii) For the rest, units of the Territorial Army should be regarded as available to support the Regular Army in their primary role of Imperial defence overseas as soon after the outbreak of war as their training and equipment permits.Air Force.80. It is generally recognised that, as stated in paragraph 45, the greatest danger against which we have to provide is attack from the air on the United Kingdom, designed to inflict a knock-out blow at the initial stage of a war. It follows that the Air Force takes a place second to none in our defensive preparations.81. Broadly, the issue which has to be determined is the choice between the three following courses : (1) Does the present authorised programme (known as Scheme F) provide sufficient protection against air attack %(2) If Scheme F is not regarded as providing adequate defence, should we adopt the scheme for the further expansion of the Royal Air Force submitted in Memorandum D.P. (P) 12 by the Secretary of State for Air, and known as Scheme J ?(3) Should we adopt a course intermediate between (1) and (2), and decide that, while Scheme F is inadequate, the right course is to adopt some, but not all, of the additions proposed in Scheme J ?82. The present authorised programme aims at a first line strength, on the completion of the programme, of 2,206 aircraft, excluding the Fleet Air Arm. Under Scheme J this figure would be raised to 3,031 machines, made up asfollows :  Metropolitan Air Force- Scheme F.    Scheme J..    Fighters                       ...... 420 532oSypes:::  :::  ...... j*Total   ...      ......... 1.736 2,331^ 470 644Overseas ...      ............ ^ ,-fiTrade Defence.........Total   .....-     -       .. 2,206 3,03183. To deal first with the Overseas squadrons : since Home Defence is our primary object, it follows that the increases in Overseas squadrons proposed in Scheme J take a lower order of priority. In view of the demands made on our resources by other requirements in a higher order of priority, it is impossible in my view to proceed with the suggested increases in our Overseas Air Strength.84. In regard to fighters, given that our main object is the defence of this country, one of the very last items on which we should seek to effect a reduction would be the fighter squadrons, which form part of our defensive system. The increases in fighter squadrons proposed by the Secretary of State for Air as part of Scheme J must therefore be accorded first priority.
85. As regards bombers, the increase proposed under Scheme J, namely, from 70 squadrons with a first line strength of 1,022 to 90 squadrons with a first line strength of 1,442 machines is based on an estimate made by the Air Staff of the probable total first-line strength to which Germany is believed to be aiming. An estimate has been made of the proportion of this force allocated to an air striking force, and of the proportion of bombers included in this air striking-force which could be used to attack this country. The number of bombers included in Scheme J is based on this latter number.86. The Air Staff l-egard it as of fundamental importance that we should maintain an air striking force equal to the German air striking force, and that we should be able to hit them as hard as they could hit us. This view has been developed at considerable length in Air Ministry Paper DP. (P) 12, and in discussions with the Air Ministry. The main arguments advanced in support of this view may be summarised as follows.87. First, that although considerable improvement has been made in our air defences we have no sure means of defence. Counter-attack, therefore, remains the chief deterrent and defence.Secondly, the deterrent effect of an air force is enormously increased if an aggressor knows that we can damage him as much as he can damage us.Thirdly, counter-offensive has a double use. In so far as it is directed successfully against enemy aerodromes, it reduces and immobilises his striking force. In so far as it is directed against important factories, it reduces his output of munitions and his capacity to replace wastage.Fourthly, if the attacks on an enemy country are relaxed, he will be able to devote a larger part of his resources, not to defence, but to attack.Fifthly, a number of public statements have been made which may broadly be described as pledges of air parity, and^ it is argued that any change of policy which constituted a departure from these pledges would have to be publicly announced. The effects of such an announcement both here and abroad would, it is suggested, be most unfortunate.88. I am not wholly convinced by these arguments. I agree, of course, that it is necessary that we should have a strong air striking force capable of effective retaliation; but it does not seem to me that our air striking force could only act as an effective deterrent if it were able to drop the same number and type of bombs on the aggressor, day in and day out, as that country could drop on us. On a matter of this sort, however, I feel bound to accept the views of the Secretary -of State for Air advised by the Chief of the Air Staff.89. I regard, however, the public statements made as to air parity as intended to convey our determination to be able to cope with any Continental power in the air, and I should not regard the statements made as in any way compelling us to base either the numbers or the types of our aeroplanes on the numbers and types of a potential enemy.90. In considering proposals for increasing our first-line strength, it is, however, also necessary to take into consideration war reserves and war potential, probably also including ground defences.91. At the present time, the Air Ministry plan to have behind the first-line strength, total reserves equivalent on an average to 225 per cent, of the first-line -strength. This figure of 225 per cent, has been worked out on two assumptions. The first is that it would not be until 6 months after the outbreak of war that the aircraft industry could be relied upon to produce any largely increased output. The reserves are therefore calculated on the assumption that they must be sufficient, with such increased output as can be obtained from the industry/to carry us through these 6 months.92. The second assumption, or rather set of assumptions, is as to the intensity at which operations would be carried out in war. A very high degree -of intensity has been assumed. Thus, during the first 6 months of war, it is assumed there would be the equivalent of about a month&apos;s intensive warfare and 5 months of sustained warfare; the scale of sustained operations being about Iialf that of intensive operations.
93. The cost of maintaining this war reserve of 225 per cent, of the first-line strength is, of course, very high. Likewise, very substantial expenditure is involved in reserves of filled and unfilled bombs, and if it were found possible to reduce the volume of these reserves, substantial savings in expenditure would result.94. The war potential for the manufacture of airframes and engines is also a matter of first importance. The aircraft industry, as at present organised, even when allowance is made for the shadow factories, is not within sight of the rate of production which the Air Ministry think will be required to maintain the Air Force in war, after the exhaustion of the war reserves, given the intensive rate of warfare assumed in their calculations. Indeed, on the basis of these assumptions, it may well be argued that the first-line strength of the Air Force under Scheme F is already too big as compared with the capacity of the aircraft and shadow industry, and that our available resources should be directed to an increase in war potential rather than to a further increase in our first-line strength.95. It seems clear, therefore, that some part at least of our available resources should be devoted to an increase in war potential. This would involve the erection of further aircraft factories. If these factories are to get into production quickly, it will be necessary not merely to erect buildings, but to equip them with machines, jigs and tools. It may even be necessary to go further and to make arrangements whereby a nucleus staff shall be permanently employed in these factories in peace time on the manufacture of aeroplanes.96. The cost of erection of further aircraft factories would be very considerable. Subject, however, to closer financial investigation I am of opinion that money spent in this way would go further to increase our real air strength than money spent in other ways. It has also been suggested to me that, given the necessary expansion of the shadow scheme and its continuous operation, it would be possible to effect considerable reductions in the scale of war reserves; but here again this proposal requires further elucidation on its financial side.97. It must also be remembered that the German aircraft industry is more extensive than our own, and that the German Air Force has already gained a long lead upon us. Indeed, it seems unlikely that it is possible for us to attain parity with the German Air Force not merely in first line strength, but also in war reserves and war potential.98. In the light of these considerations, and bearing in mind the limitations of our resources, I suggest that the following policy should be adopted in regard to the expansion of the Air Force : (i) We should concentrate on increases in the Metropolitan Air Force andshould not make further increases in the overseas forces, (ii) We should provide the full increases asked for in the fighter squadrons of the Metropolitan Force, (iii) As regards the bomber squadrons of the Metropolitan Air Force, the choice lies broadly between : (a) some increase in the present first-line strength, with reduced pro-vision for reserves and greatly improved arrangements for war potential; and(b) maintenance of the present first-line strength and the presentreserve strength, but with improved arrangements for war potential.In my view the balance of argument is in favour of proceeding on the lines of the former alternative.99. The proposals of the preceding paragraph fall short of the Air Staffs demands in two respects :-First, in the absence of an increase in our Overseas Air Forces, we should, in their view, continue in a-position of permanent and dangerous insecurity vis-a-vis certain foreign Powers.Secondly, the proposal would not give us an air striking force equal in all respects (first line strength, stored war reserves and war potential) to the German Air Force, and to this extent it falls short of the Air Staffs demands.
2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, December 15, 1937.100. Nevertheless, the proposals represent, in my view, the right course for ns to pursue, when regard is had to the general policy outlined in this report, and to the considerable demands which will be made on our resources by the suggested increases in the Metropolitan Air Force. If my colleagues approve generally of these proposals, a detailed scheme to give effect to them will be worked out and dealt with in my next report.VI. Summary of Issues arising on the Report.101.

(P.) 3.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee.A NEW STANDARD OF NAVAL STRENGTH.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I CIRCULATE for the consideration of the Committee the attached Memorandum by the Board of Admiralty.(Initialled) S. H.Admiralty, April 29, 1937.ENCLOSURE.Origin of the proposal for a new naval standard.IN the Third Report of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee it was recommended that we should aim at a new standard of naval strength which was defined as follows : &quot; (i) To enable us to place a fleet in the Far East fully adequate to act on the defensive and to serve as a strong deterrent against any threat to our interests in that part of the globe; (ii) To maintain in all circumstances in Home waters a force able to meet the requirements of a war with Germany at the same time.Included in (i) and (ii) would be the forces necessary in all parts of the world, behind the cover of the Main Fleets, to protect our territories and merchant ships against sporadic attacks.&quot;(Paper No. D.R.C. 37 (also Paper No. D.P.R. 52), paragraph 34.*)2. The following paragraph also appeared in the report of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee : &quot; 44. Although the situation as to any international agreement on the size of fleets is not yet clear, we recommend that the Government should at once adopt the new standard in principle and instruct the Admiralty-(i) To work out the naval programme required to give effect to it as soon as the necessary data are available; and* Also Enclosure No. 2 to C.I.D. Paper No. 1215-B. [15086] b
(ii) To make suggestions as to any items in the new programme that can be put in hand before the expiration of the next 3 years. These will probably be limited by material considerations to the smaller classes of warships.&quot;3. The Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at their meeting* on the 20th January, 1936, adopted the following conclusion :-&quot; (4) To ask the Admiralty to furnish the information referred to in para-graph 44 (i) and (ii) of Paper No. D.P.R. 52 and to withhold, until that information had been received, approval for the new standard of naval strength referred to in paragraph 34, and also final approval for the cruiser replacement programme outlined in paragraph 49.&quot;4. The Cabinet at its meeting of the 25th February, 1936 (Cabinet 10 (36)), decided, inter alia, that nothing should be said in the White Paper on Defence (Command 5107) on the possibility of the adoption in the near future of a new standard of naval strength, more especially as approval for the proposed standard had been reserved until the Admiralty had made a further report as recommended by the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements.5. The Admiralty considered the question of a new standard in detail, and at the 21st meeting of the Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements on the 25th May, 1936, the First Lord informed the Committee of the strength in the various classes of ship involved in the new standard and the building programme appropriate to give effect to this standard.6. The Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements at this meeting decided : &quot; That, without prejudice to the standard of naval strength that might be adopted after existing deficiencies had been made good, it was desirable to examine the practicability of accelerating the naval programme and the effect which such acceleration would have on the programmes of the other two Services, and to ask the First Lord to submit his suggestions to that end, including proposals to meet the resultant requirements in personnel.&quot;The acceleration referred to was subsequently put forward, approved for the 1936 programme, and was given effect to in the second Naval Supplementary Estimate, 1936.7. The present situation is, therefore, that no approval has been given to the adoption of a new standard of naval strength, but that the building programme for such a standard approximates to the actual programmes for 1936 and 1937.The need for a new standard.8. For a number of years past our naval strength in the various classes of vessels has been limited by the two treaties which came to an end on the 31st December, 1936. The strength accepted in these treaties was based on the One-Power standard adopted in 1925 in the light of the international situation then existing.9. This standard only required that our fleet, wherever situated, should be equal to the fleet of any other nation, wherever situated. The next standard proposed, namely, that in 1932 (quoted in paragraph 30 of Paper No. D.P.R. 52), for the first time took into consideration the fact that, while we were engaged in the Far East, our security in Europe might be threatened, and it, therefore, laid down that we should be able to retain in European waters a &apos;&apos; deterrent force to prevent our vital home terminal areas being commanded by the strongest European naval power while we took up a defensive position in the Far East and brought home the necessary units for home defence.The Defence Requirements Subcommittee, recognising the danger of the 1932 standard, in that the delay in disengaging our forces in the East and bringing them home might^take so long as to lead to disaster, have proposed the new standard quoted in paragraph 1 above for our security. In doing so it took into consideration the new circumstances that had been steadily arising with* D.P.R. (D.E.) 5th Meeting.
the growth of the strength of the European navies. At the end of the war all these navies, with the exception of our own, were in a state of decline, and it was possible at that time to accept a standard which took no direct account of their strength but merely assumed that the margin which we should have over Japan on the 5:5:3 ratio would be sufficient to meet our needs in Home waters. The rebuilding of the French and Italian navies, unhampered by the London Naval Treaty, led to the proposal in 1932 of a safer naval standard it was, however, impossible between that date and the present day to take any action to implement this proposal, as our own strength in all categories of vessels was fixed by treaty until the end of 1936.The building of the new German navy, which is now in progress, though fortunately its strength is limited to 35 per cent, of our own, is the final factor which makes it necessary now seriously to consider the implementing of the new naval standard proposed by the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee.10. The Defence Requirements Sub-Committee in their report have clearly emphasised the difficulty of conducting naval warfare against highly efficient enemies in two theatres so widely separated and, indeed, it is only necessary to recall the late war, where Germany was the only naval enemy to be considered, to realise with what difficulties we should be faced if sufficient forces were not available at all times in both theatres, and especially the Home theatre. When the capital ships now building in Europe are completed, it would not be possible, on our existing standard of naval strength, to safeguard the Empire in the Far East if already engaged in war in Europe; even with Germany limited to 35 per cent, of our own strength, we could never take the risk of despatching to the Far East a sufficient fleet to act as a deterrent to Japanese aggression. The Defence Requirements Sub-Committee stated, moreover, that &quot;it would be suicidal folly to blind our eyes to the possibility of a simultaneous, or practically simultaneous, threat on both fronts.&quot;11. In the opinion of the Admiralty so long as a possibility of war both in the East and in Europe exists it is only possible to ensure our security and safeguard our Imperial position, as the German navy is rebuilt, if the proposed new standard of naval strength is worked to.The Admiralty consequently consider it to be of the greatest importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt this new standard of strength and authorise the Admiralty to base their plans and requirements on this standard.Arguments in favour of an early decision.12. It may be argued that, if we are committed to our maximum building programmes for the next few years, the question whether we should adopt a new standard is a point of academical interest since we shall already be working towards that standard at our best speed and cannot attain it for several years to come.This argument, however, leaves out of consideration all the doubts and difficulties which arise, so long as our ultimate naval strength remains undecided in principle.13. The most important of these doubts and difficulties is that connected with confidence in the basis of our system of Imperial defence. The general foundation of this system is the ability to send the Main Fleet to any particular area which may be threatened. Recent indications have shown clearly that there is doubt whether under existing political conditions in Europe and with the rise of the German navy, we should, in fact, be able to send an adequate fleet to the Far East if a menace were to arise in that area.14. At present the outside observer sees the German navy rising, he knows that on our existing declared One-Power standard we might be able to send a fleet to the Far East before Germany&apos;s programme is complete, but after that date he cannot see how we can do so unless our strength is increased.15. It is of the greatest importance to re-establish confidence in the basis of our system of Imperial defence, and it is considered that this can only be done if the responsible authorities at home and overseas are informed that the strength of the British navy will be increased as necessary to enable it to fulfil its task. Such action presupposes a decision by tlis Majesty&apos;s Government on a new standard.
16. A further reason why some decision is required now is the coming Imperial Conference in 1937. This conference will be a most suitable moment to discuss our naval policy and indeed it is inevitable that this shall be done.17. Naval expansion, even more than the expansion of the other services, is a matter which can only take place slowly, and failing a definite programme to work to, it would be impossible for the Admiralty to make arrangements to increase the personnel required. Ships can be built much quicker than naval personnel can be trained. If, for instance, we achieved by 1940 an efficient One-Power standard we should not subsequently be able to add to that standard unless arrangements had already been made and steps taken for a further increase of personnel and other matters.18. A decision has also become urgent on account of the building programme for 1938, which the Admiralty must soon commence to prepare. While the building programmes of 1936 and 1937 are not inconsistent with an acceleration of building on our present One-Power standard of naval strength, this will hot be the case in 1938 and later years.Administrative decisions as to numbers of personnel and accommodation required for them depend on our ultimate strength. Such decisions are in many cases overdue.19. Finally, so long as our ultimate naval strength remains undecided in pnnciple, it is difficult to prepare war plans or to consider general strategic dispositions. Such uncertainty prevents the Admiralty from being able to guarantee the navy&apos;s ability to implement our foreign policy.The question of a public announcement.20. The proposals above are concerned with a decision on our naval standard and the promulgation of this decision in secrecy to responsible authorities. A further question which will arise is that of making a public announcement in some form or other in connection with a decision to depart from our present declared One-Power standard. Such an announcement, while it might be welcomed in many quarters, might have undesirable reactions on our relations with the U.S.A. and might lead to difficulties with that country in connection with the cruiser holiday. Again, an announcement made now at a date when we clearly cannot, in fact, increase our naval strength appreciably for some while might have the opposite effect to that desired in this country and abroad in that it would raise doubts as to our security and our ability to uphold our responsibility at the present time. This might be an encouragement to other countries to challenge our interests.Size of the &quot; New Standard &quot; Navy.21. After a careful examination of the strategical problems that would be involved by the acceptance of the new standard proposed by the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee, the Naval Staff have concluded that we should need a navy of the following strength, in the principal classes of ship : Capital ships       ...      .........      ......       20Aircraft carriers (including 3 ships at long notice for whom no aircraft would be provided in peace)   ...        15Cruisers     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 100Destroyers   ...       ...       ...       ............        22 flotillas.Submarines ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        82In addition there would be the usual proportion of smaller vessels, and also a few ships maintained for special duties in connection with training and experimental work.The reasoning which led to the foregoing conclusions is set forth in some detail in the Appendix.This estimate of the, strength required can only be tentative, as it is based on certain assumptions regarding Japanese building. So long as Germany adheres to the 35 per cent, ratio, that part of the forecast Avhich is related to requirements in home waters is on a firmer.basis.
22. A thorough investigation has also been made into the ultimate cost of the navy, if it is expanded as above. Even allowing for a substantially larger number of ships to be maintained by the Dominions,* but making no allowance for a rise in prices or for the extra cost to Navy Votes if the Fleet Air Arm is transferred to Admiralty control, t it is estimated that on present standards of maintenance the &quot; stabilised &quot; Navy Vote would be a little over  104,000,000 (excluding charges for interest and sinking fund under the Defence Loans Act, 1937). By &quot; stabilised&quot; Navy Vote is meant the total average annual cost of the navy after the period of expansion and making good deficiencies had elapsed.It does not follow that the annual estimate will remain at this average figure. It might vary up or down to the extent of, say, about  5,000,000, depending on the replacement programme of the year.23. Expenditure of  104,000,000 per annum is on a scale which the Admiralty realise may present formidable difficulties and the possibility of effecting savings without impairing the ability of the navy to wage the dual war has therefore to be examined.24. In the first place the scope for saving money by the following methods was considered : (i) Reduced replacement costs, by assuming a slightly longer &quot;life&quot; forcertain categories of ship, (ii) Reduced expenditure on the forecast standard of maintenance and replacement of Fleet Air Arm aircraft.(iii) Increased reliance on reserves of man-power, thus permitting a reductionin the numbers of active service personnel.(iv) Economies in the dockyards, armament supply, and works and buildingsvotes, if a somewhat lower standard of maintenance were found to be practicable.25. Over and above savings of this character, the Admiralty feel that some further economy may be needed, and they would therefore be prepared to accept the following reductions on the full number of ships quoted in paragraph 21 :  1 large aircraft carrier (together with its aircraft). 2 cruisers.1 flotilla of destroyers. 9 submarines.The elimination of these vessels would save approximately  2,500,000 per annum.26. It is more difficult to estimate what savings may be ultimately found possible as a result of the measures set out in paragraph 24, but the combined effect of these savings and those mentioned in paragraph 25 may be expected to be of the order of  7,000,000 per annum.27. The effect of these proposals would be that the new standard fleet would eventually need an average Vote of about  97,000,000 (subject to the reservations referred to in paragraph 22), and would include the following ships to be maintained by the United Kingdom : 20 capital ships.14 aircraft carriers (includes 3 at long notice without aircraft).88 cruisers.18 destroyer flotillas.73 submarines.These figures are based on the assumption that the Dominions will maintain 10 cruisers at least and 3 flotillas of destroyers.. 28. In the foregoing analysis an attempt has been made to translate a political formula into a standard of naval strength expressed in definite numbers of ships and men, with a corresponding estimate of cost. This appears to the Admiralty to be necessary if the problem before the Government is to be definedv . * It has been assumed that 10 cruisers and 3 flotillas are maintained by the Dominions instead of 6 cruisers and 1  flotillas as heretofore.f It has been assumed for the purpose of these estimates thot, if the Fleet Air Arm were transferred to .Admiralty control, the extra cost to naval Votes would only be in the nature of a transfer from one Department of State to another.
with precision. At the same time, it is not possible to say even now that the precise figures given and no others represent the only method of translating the political formula. Still less is it possible to state dogmatically what the position may be in, say, 10 years&apos; time, or what conclusion a future Board of Admiralty may reach as a consequence of developments not yet foreseen.29. In particular, as already stated, certain assumptions have been made for similar reasons as to ships to be maintained by the Dominions, though, of course, the decision in this matter is for the Dominions themselves.30. Further, even if no alteration were made in the number of ships now proposed, it is obvious that long-range forecasts of costs are likely to be falsified by unpredictable factors.31. It should be noted that the political formula enunciated in the first paragraph of this memorandum was arrived at before the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and its practical interpretation, as explained in the Appendix, takes no account of a possibly hostile Italy. If we must include Italy as well as Germany and Japan among our potential enemies, our naval strength must either be still further increased or we must rely on a naval combination with another Power.Effect of a -possible agreement with Japan.32. The basic assumption on which the strength of the navy has been calculated to meet the proposed new standard of strength amounts in practice to readiness for simultaneous war with Germany and Japan, though the fleet in the East would only be that required to act on the defensive. No allowance was made for allies, neither was any allowance made for additional enemies. Moreover, the fleets proposed would give&apos; a smaller margin over Germany than was ours in 1914, and would involve the acceptance of inferiority in the Far East. It seems plain, therefore, that no lesser strength would be safe so long as the navy had to face the combination postulated by the terms of the new standard.33. That the navy required in these circumstances is very large should occasion no surprise. Historically, the connection between our naval strength and our relations with Japan has long been recognised. It was defined with great clarity by Sir Edward Grey in 1912, in a speech in which he showed the impossibility of maintaining naval superiority everywhere, and the difference between our position in Home waters and overseas. The following extracts would be as true to-day as they were 25 years ago : &quot; Sir E. Grey : Was it its opinion that we should maintain a separate sufficient margin of strength to protect our own islands in the Home waters; a sufficient margin of strength to rule independently in the Far East, and a sufficient margin of strength to keep up our strength permanently, I suppose, both in the West in the Atlantic and in the East in the Pacific and a separate standard in the Mediterranean also ?  That is absolutely out of the question.&quot;* * * * * *&quot; In the first place, you must not rely upon your foreign policy to protect the United Kingdom. That is to say, if you let your margin of naval strength in home waters fall below that which may be brought to bear against you rapidly, you are setting foreign policy a task you ought not to set it. The risk of an attack on the United Kingdom, stronger in force than we could meet with the ships we keep in home waters, is one not to be settled by diplomacy.&quot;* * * * * *&apos;&apos; When you get further afield into other parts of the world it is a very different matter; then foreign policy and naval strategy do and must depend upon each other to a large extent. Take the question of the Far East. Of course, the relation between the Japanese Alliance and naval strategy is a most intimate one.  I should like to say this about the Japanese Alliance.&quot;. &apos; ; * &apos;    ,* *   &apos;?i   -   .    * *&apos;&apos; In the last few years, while we have been in office I do not say because we have been in office-the Japanese Alliance has worked nothing but good.&quot;
34. Sir Edward Grey was justifying the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in the previous year, which had enabled us to leave Japan in undisputed maritime control in the Far East. If it were possible for that alliance to be revived (on a similar basis of mutual interest) we could once again relate the size of the navy mainly to its European responsibilities. But the circumstances favourable to an Anglo-Japanese alliance no longer exist, and the most which may reasonably be hoped for is some form of &quot; gentleman&apos;s agreement &quot; analogous to that recently concluded with Italy. Such an agreement would not justify anything approaching the reductions in naval strength that might result from an alliance, since it could never be relied upon to withstand the stress of war in Europe. Japan would always feel tempted to take advantage of our pre-occupation in Europe unless she knew that we were strong in the Far East as well. Thus, in order to be effective, a &quot; gentleman&apos;s &quot; agreement with Japan must be based upon our strength, not upon our weakness.35. On the other hand, it would be going too far to say that an agreement with Japan could have no effect at all on our naval strength. The effect, however, would be rather upon our degree of readiness than upon our actual strength, although even in that, some slight reductions might be permissible. These reductions could take the form of a somewhat lower insurance against attacks on our trade in the East than would otherwise be prudent.36. Considering each category of ship in turn, it would seem that the changes in strength consequent upon an Anglo-J apanese agreement might be as follows :- &apos;(i) Capital Ships.No reduction below the total of 20 ships could be recommended. Ultimately, our sea-power depends on our battleneets, and capital ships take so long to build that we should almost certainly end a war with no more than we had at its outset.(ii) Aircraft Carriers.Four small carriers had been proposed for the protection of trade, one of which would be stationed in peace on the East Indies Station. It is considered that this vessel might be dispensed with.(iii) Cruisers.It is thought that we could accept five cruisers less and, further, that no reinforcement of the present total of six cruisers in the Far East (in time of peace) would be necessary. (Under the full &apos;&apos; new standard &apos;&apos; and Defence Requirements Committee&apos;s proposals it had been intended to raise the peace strength of the China Fleet to 10 cruisers.) Thus a total of 83 cruisers would be maintained by the United Kingdom, of which perhaps 36 would be in commission and 47 in reserve. In making this recommendation due allowance has been made for the probability that the Dominions would not maintain as many cruisers as had been contemplated, once the agreement with Japan was reached.(iv) Destroyers.The fleet proposed to fulfil the new standard included 21 flotillas (see paragraphs 21 and 25). There will, in addition, be four old (converted) flotillas included in our strength in escort vessels. It is proposed, in the event of an Anglo-Japanese agreement, to accept that two of the old converted flotillas should count towards our destroyer strength, and that our peace dispositions should stand at one flotilla in the Far.East, instead of rising to two, as it is at present intended. The effect of this proposal would be to give us 19 flotillas, (13 underage and 6 overage), of which it is assumed that the Dominions would maintain three. This leaves the United Kingdom with 16 flotillas, (11 underage and 5 overage) to maintain, exclusive of 4 flotillas of old destroyers converted for escort duties.(v) Other classes of ship.No changes are proposed.
37. The approximate annual savings to be expected from these reductions will be of the following order :  1 less aircraft carrier (small)     ...       ...      ... 515,0005 less cruisers (large)       ...       ...       ...      ...       1,625,0002 less flotillas.........      ......        860,000Total     ............      3,000,00038. The lower degree of readiness that would be acceptable in the event of an Anglo-Japanese agreement might take the form of keeping a proportion of the Reserve Fleet at extended notice. It is difficult to assess the resulting saving in terms of money, but it would be relatively slight. To some extent it has been anticipated in the estimate quoted in paragraph 37, which assumed that all the vessels reduced came from the seagoing fleet, whereas in fact one cruiser and one flotilla would probably be reduced from the reserve fleet.39. It is, therefore, considered unwise to assume that the financial saving on Navy Votes, consequent upon an agreement with Japan, would exceed  3,000,000 per annum, leaving it at a total of about  94,000,000.Effect of improved relations ivith Germany.40. If it were possible, by coming to some sort of political agreement with Germany, to obtain real security against the sudden outbreak of war in Europe whilst we were engaged with Japan in the Far East, a yet smaller navy could be accepted. It is difficult to express the fleet that would be required under such conditions in exact numerical terms. Broadly speaking, however, it is considered that its size would approximate to that aimed at by the D.P.R. (D.R.) Committee, i.e. 15 capital ships,8 aircraft carriers,4 aircraft depot ships,* 70 cruisers (of which 10 could be over-age;, 16 flotillas of destroyers (of which 4 could be over-age), 55 submarines,with the exception that 20 capital ships would be required and six of those cruisers which are to be converted to A/A ships should not be counted towards the total of 70 cruisers. The reason for asking that not less than 20 capital ships should be maintained is the same as that put forward in paragraph 36 (i).The above figures include ships assumed to be maintained by the Dominions.41. An estimate of the &quot;stabilised&quot; cost of the fleet suggested in the D.P.R (D.R.) Committee&apos;s report was also made on present standards of main-tenance, and came out at about  88,000,000 per annum for the United Kingdom. The additional cost of 5 capital ships which are assumed to be in reserve plus six anti-aircraft ships in reserve, amounts to  3,125,000, and might be more than offset by economies on the lines of those referred to in paragraph 24. Accordingly, it is considered justifiable to assume that the size of Navy Votes, subject to improved relations with Germany, would be of the order of  88,000,000. This estimate is subject to the same reservations concerning a rise in prices and the transfer of the Fleet Air Arm as were made before.42. As indicated in paragraph 22, all the foregoing figures relate to a &quot; stabilised &quot; fleet after the period of rearmament and borrowing is over. An attempt has been made to forecast the financial position during the expansion period. The best estimate that can be given is that for the new standard the expansion period will last about seven more years during which expenditure of some  800,000,000 will be incurred, whereas for the fleet suggested in the D.P.R. (D.R.) Committee&apos;s, report the expansion period might last three more years, during which  350,000,000 might be spent. It should not be inferred from this that the new standard involves an additional expenditure of  800,000,000 less  350,000,000 or  450,000,000 in excess of that for the fleet based on the D.P.R. (D.R.) Committee&apos;s formula. On the contrary the difference in expen-diture after 1937 and up to 1944 inclusive, is about  125,000,000.* The four aircraft depot ships would now become two small carriers as this type has. replaced the projected aircruft depot ship.
Summary of Conclusions and Recommendation^(i) No approval has yet been given for the adoption of the new standard of naval strength recommended by the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee in 1935. But the building programmes, necessary to reach such a standard, approximate to the actual programmes for 1936 and 1937.(ii) With the rise of modern navies in Europe our present standard of naval strength would not only be insufficient for the defence of our position in the Far East if we were already at war in Europe, but it would preclude at any time the despatch of a sufficient fleet to the Far East to deter Japan from aggression. The Admiralty, therefore, attach the greatest importance to the adoption by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the proposed new standard of strength.(iii) It has been assumed that increased forces will be maintained by the Dominions, but this, of course, is not a matter for the Admiralty to decide. It is recommended that this aspect of the question should be explored at the forth-coming Imperial Conference.(iv) An early decision on our future standard of naval strength is also necessary for reasons of administration and planning.(v) To implement the proposed new standard of strength, the Naval Staff recommend, on purely strategical grounds, that the fleet should include : 20 capital ships. 15 aircraft carriers. 100 cruisers (of which 10 might be maintained by the Dominions). 22 destroyer flotillas  (of  which  3 might be maintained  by   theDominions). 82 submarines.(vi) Subject to certain reservations, the &quot; stabilised &quot; cost of such a navy (if run on lines similar to the present-day navy) is estimated at about  104,000,000 per annum.(vii) By effecting certain economies and reductions in Fleet strength the Admiralty hope to reduce the cost to about  97,000,000 per annum.(viii) The basic assumption on which the strength of the navy has been calculated amounts in practice to readiness for simultaneous war with Germany and Japan.   It takes no account of the possibility of Italy being also hostile.(ix) If an agreement could be reached with Japan, leading to improved relations, further reductions could be accepted, bringing down the cost to perhaps  94,000,000 per annum.(x) If, by means of a political agreement with Germany, the risk of a sudden outbreak of war in Europe could be eliminated, yet further reductions would be acceptable and the stabilised Navy Vote might be of the order of  88,000,000.(xi) Excluding lesser types of ships and a few vessels maintained for special duties, the navy to be maintained by the United Kingdom, under each of the foregoing conditions would include the following : Political A greementsituation      Understanding        with as at present.     with Japan.

Appendix to Enclosure.Calculation of the Size of Fleet required under the Proposed New Standardof Naval Strength.General Considerations.In calculating the requirements of the new standard, it has been assumed that our aim in the Far East, as long as the war with Germany lasted, could only be to maintain the situation which existed when the fleet got out to the East and prevent any further offensive operations by Japan.2. The fleet required would, therefore, need to be strong enough to give covering protection to our trade in the East, to hold its own in a battle with Japan should she risk such a battle, and to prevent her undertaking any major operation against Australia, New Zealand or Borneo so long as our fleet was in being. Our fleet should, however, be sufficiently strong to be able to afford the detachment of small forces to operate offensively with the object of harassing the Japanese navy.3. War with Germany would, on the other hand, create a threat to our vital home arteries in a manner that could never take place in a war with Japan, and the maintenance of a force fully adequate to counter Germany with a sufficient margin has, therefore, been regarded as essential.4. It will be seen from the remarks that follow that, while battleship strength is wholly relative to German and Japanese strength, our strength in submarines is wholly absolute.In the other classes of ships the numbers required are partly relative to German and Japanese strength and partly absolute.5. The proposals which follow represent the minimum strength with which the Naval Staff could advise the undertaking of what practically amounts to a war in two hemispheres a situation which, it must be stressed, would be more serious than any that has been faced by the British Empire in modern time. No complete or final technical report on so big a problem is possible at this stage, and if the principle of the new standard is adopted, it will be necessary for the proposals to give effect to it to be reviewed year by year according to the development of building by foreign Powers and the financial and other considerations of the time.Capital Ship Strength.6. Japan at present possesses 9 capital ships to bur 15, and after 1940 her strength will become uncertain as she will probably not scrap any of her existing capital ships when she completes new vessels, which she can lay down after the 31st December, 1936.7. When operating in the Far East our ships are far from their main repair facilities and sources of supply and have only the facilities of Singapore to rely on. The Japanese fleet, on the other hand, has its full home country resources available close at hand. These facts in themselves are equivalent to an advantage of two capital ships to Japan since at an average moment we could not rely on less than 2 ships being absent.8. On the other hand, the stakes at issue in the event of a fleet action would be greater for Japan than for us. A British defeat would imperil our interests in the East: a Japanese defeat would imperil her home country. Thus, to achieve our object of acting on the defensive and serving as a deterrent against any threat to our interests in the East it is necessary that our capital ship strength should be such that Japan&apos;s chances of obtaining victory in a fleet action would be so slight that she would not seek one. This condition should be achieved if at our average moment we could meet the full Japanese capital ship fleet with a force less in strength than that fleet by one capital ship.9. When allowance is made for our restricted repair facilities, which are referred to in paragraph 7, it follows that, to avoid at any time being inferior in ships available by more than &quot;one capital ship, we must have in the Far East a margin of one ship in excess of the Japanese total.
10. The strength of the German fleet is now calculable, since it is fixed at 35 per cent, of our own. The strategical situation in a future war with Germany must in general be similar to that which prevailed in the last war and while the German fleet would be likely to spend most of its time in harbour the initiative as to when it came out to dispute our control would rest with Germany. It follows that, as in the last war, we must be ready at our average moment to meet the German fleet at its selected moment. Home waters being our vital area in a way that the Far East never can be, it is essential that this margin shall be sufficient for all contingencies. The margin is composed partly of the superiority necessary to give reasonable certainty of success in battle and partly of that necessary to maintain our normal programme of docking. The proper minimum to meet these contingencies is a superiority of 3 ships.11. The German capital ship fleet does not, unfortunately, correspond numerically to an exact 35 per cent, of our own, since its size is calculated on a total tonnage basis and the earlier German capital ships built and building are less than the maximum unit size. Thus, while our strength remains at 15 capital ships, 35 per cent, ought to give Germany only 5 ships. She will in fact have 6, assuming that the 3 &quot; Deutschland &quot; class are ultimately replaced by one large ship.Thus, our capital ship strength in Home waters should not be less than 9 ships to six of Germany.12. When this force is added to the force required in the Far East to meet the existing Japanese strength, we arrive at a total of 19 capital ships. This total would automatically allow Germany a further increase to 7 capital ships, which in its turn raises our number to 20.13. With the proposed new standard it is clear that as the German strength is fixed at 35 per cent, of our own, both our strength and that of Germany will progress in proportion to the Japanese strength.14. The capital ship strength required can be worked out mathematically, but, for practical purposes, our requirements to meet the conditions detailed above can be expressed as &quot; 1^ times the Japanese strength -f 6 ships,&quot; or, in tabular form, as follows :  Capital Ships.British Strength CorrespondingJapanese Strength.              required. German Strength.9 (present strength)                   20 710                              21 711                               22 712                              24 8Aircraft Carrier Strength.15. The functions of naval aircraft are both strategical, such as recon-naissance for the fleet or for vessels operating in direct defence of trade, and tactical, such as attack on enemy vessels with torpedoes or bombs, observation of the gunfire of their own fleet, laying smoke screens, and attack on enemy aircraft. Without aircraft a navy would be at a great disadvantage if opposed to a navy which possessed aircraft, but, apart from this, the existence of land aircraft, including possibly airships, capable of reconnoitring for enemy vessels to a considerable distance off the coast and attacking them when located renders the provision of naval aircraft a necessity in order to enable a Naval Power to carry out operations near an enemy&apos;s coast.16. Although many countries, including ourselves, are fitting capital ships and cruisers to carry several aircraft, this method cannot provide either the numbers or types necessary, nor would it meet requirements in other respects, since the aircraft that have to be catapulted off ships may not be able to be recovered.The aircraft carrier, designed primarily to enable aircraft to be operated from her as a floating aerodrome, is consequently an essential requirement in a modern fleet.
17. During the last 15 years our aircraft carrier tonnage has been limited by treaty, and the limits accepted allowed only for the maintenance of the aircraft carriers required for work with the Main Fleet with only a margin of possibly one ship for other duties. It has consequently not been possible for the Admiralty to provide aircraft carriers for employment on the trade routes to assist our cruisers and armed merchant cruisers in the protection of trade. Plans have been drawn up for the conversion of merchant ships into aircraft carriers after the outbreak of war, but this work would take about 12 months to complete.18. With the end of quantitative limitations it is possible to give considera-tion to the construction of aircraft carriers for trade protection, and  2,060,000 was included in the new construction estimates put before the D.P.R. (D.R.) Committee (D.R.C. 37, Schedule 1, Appendix 1) for this purpose. The question of the possible reaction of the building of these vessels on our cruiser requirements is dealt with in paragraph 38 below.19. Consequently, our aircraft carrier requirements must now be divided into those for work with the Main Fleet and those for trade protection.20. Japan has 4 aircraft carriers built, 1 building and 2 projected. She also possesses 2 seaplane carriers built and 3 building or projected. In her own waters she has the great advantage of a chain of air bases in her islands which would enable her to keep a very large area under observation by shore-based air reconnaissance.21. For offensive operations against Japan it would therefore be necessary for our fleet to possess a sufficient number of aircraft carriers. For the defensive role visualised in the new standard of naval strength, which need not necessarily involve operations near to Japan, it will only be necessary to provide our fleet with the carriers needed to maintain an adequate reconnaissance and a striking force of reasonable strength. It will also be necessary to make due allowance for docking and refit.  It is considered that 4 carriers would meet these requirements.22. In Home waters, Germany will be allowed 35 per cent, of our total carrier tonnage. Although we expect some assistance in the North Sea from shore-based aircraft, this is equally true of Germany, and it is not unlikely that the opposing land-based air forces will tend to some extent to cancel one another out so far as naval operations are concerned. It would not therefore be safe to accept an appreciably weaker carrier force with the Home Fleet than that possessed by Germany. To avoid this, provision is needed for not less than 4 aircraft carriers in Home waters.23. The number of carriers suggested for the two main fleets must be regarded as tentative. By arguing on theoretical lines it is possible to arrive at much higher totals, and, if in the coming years all the claims now being made for aircraft are substantiated, it may become necessary to provide for greater strength in carriers. Alternatively, technical progress in aircraft may enable shore-based squadrons to perform some of the fleet duties for which we rely at present on carriers. Another factor the significance of which remains to be proved, is the adoption by the British navy of armoured carriers. The immediate effect of this is to give us only half as many aircraft for a given tonnage as are obtainable using carriers of the unarmoured type.24. The use of carriers on the trade routes is a matter in which little experience is yet available, but a minimum of 5 is suggested herein for operations in conjunction with our cruiser forces. This number of 5 must remain open to review, and experience will very probably show that one aircraft carrier per cruiser squadron operating on trade protection work is required. It is hoped that by the building of these aircraft carriers for trade protection, an economy in the number of cruisers required can be effected.25. In addition to the above, at least one large aircraft carrier must be retained for training duties in both peace and war. This vessel can be over-age. Tl&apos;p total number of aircraft carriers required is therefore:  For work with fleet in the East     ... ... ... ... 4For work with fleet in Home waters ... ... ... 4For work on trade routes  .. :       ... ... ... ... 5For training purposes      ....       ... ... ... ... 1 (overage).
which we have possessed at various periods1895 1904 1914 1918in the past, e.g.123 138 112 10928. For a war against Japan or against a single European Power, our cruiser requirements have, on many occasions in the past, been stated to be a minimum of 70, and then only on the assumption that arrangements have been made for the rapid conversion of a number of merchant ships (74) to armed merchant cruisers on the outbreak of war.This requirement of 70 has been made up of : 25 for work with the Main Fleet. 45 for control of trade.The figure of 25 has been arrived at by the need for equality with the enemy cruiser strength in the war area (since the enemy at his given moment may always concentrate his cruisers with his fleet) and the strength of the battlefleets.It has also been assumed in these past calculations that the Japanese cruiser strength would be subject to agreed quantitative limitation.The figure of 45 for control of trade has been based on the assumption that a serious threat to our trade i s unlikely to arise in more than one ocean at the same time.29. Under the new standard of naval strength the assumptions on which both the above figures were based require revision. Firstly, two enemy main fleets now have to be taken into account, and, secondly, a serious threat to our trade may arise simultaneously in the Atlantic and in the East, as Germany and Japan, situated at the opposite sides of the earth, may both concentrate on attacking it.Cruisers with the Main Fleets.30. The cruiser strength required with a battlefleet is dependent partly on the size of the fleet, and partly on the enemy&apos;s cruiser strength. Japan has at present 33 cruisers and she may increase this number in the future. To enable our battlefleet to act in the Far East as required by the new standard of naval strength we can accept a somewhat smaller cruiser strength than that which would be required for &quot;an offensive strategy against Japan, and so long as Japan does not add to her present numbers, a strength of 25 cruisers should be sufficient. Included in this strength is a small margin to allow the undertaking of small offensive operations with a view to causing dispersal of Japanese forces.31. It is difficult to know exactly what Germany&apos;s intentions with regard to cruiser building circ.  is there is provision in our agreement with her for a certain transfer between various categories. It appears reasonable, however, to assume that Germany may have 20 cruisers in all in 1942. Thereafter she has the right to increase further if and when we exceed 60 under-age cruisers. Even if no transfer from other categories takes place, Germany could have 35 cruisers if and when we reach the proposed new total of 100 (see paragraph 39 below).32. Until we know what Germany will build it is not practicable to make an exact estimate of the cruiser strength we shall require with the fleet in Home waters in a future war with that country, but the number of 30 is assumed for26. The position is complicated, however, by the fact that we shall possess for many years a number of unarmoured carriers, which, though not at all satisfactory for fleet work, have a good aircraft capacity and cannot reasonably be discounted. They will include the Ark Royal, which is not yet complete and which will carry no less than 72 aircraft. It is accordingly proposed to accept 12 carriers, for whom aircraft and personnel shall be provided, and to retain 3 of our existing carriers in reserve at long notice. No personnel or equipment will be provided for the latter, but they will be available to bring forward in the event of war.Cruiser Strength.27. The need for a large number of cruisers is no new requirement, and it is not based on the imminence of a war threat, as may be seen from the numbers
the present, and is certainly not excessive when the need for refits and dockings and the experience of the Great War are borne in mind.33.   The total strength required with the main fleets in war areas mayconsequently be estimated as : Far East.................. 25Home waters      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 30Total        ......&apos;    ...... 55Cruisers for Control of Trade.34. Cruisers and other vessels employed on the control of trade may be employed either as convoy escorts or on patrol of focal areas, &amp;c, where the threat of attack is not such as to call for convoy. In addition, in each area certain cruisers will be required to operate against enemy trade and to round up enemy raiders..35. Further, in certain areas the convoy escorts may have to be vessels with a specially powerful A/A armament to protect our shipping from air attack in the event of an enemy adopting unrestricted warfare from the air, against which there is at present no international agreement to correspond with the rules for the conduct of submarine warfare contained in Part IV of the London Naval Treaty. Even if agreement is reached on this subject in the future, it will remain a potential menace, and the Admiralty are, therefore, taking steps to equip a proportion of our cruisers with the necessary special A/A armament.36. The number of 45 cruisers for trade work, which has been put forward in the past took no account of the need for A/A escorts, and assumed that convoy would only be required in one ocean at a time, e.g., in the Indian Ocean. (The method of protection by convoy requires considerably more ships than that of patrol, but, of course, affords better protection.)37. Under the new standard of naval strength it is necessary to make provision against an attack on trade by Germany and Japan at the same time. This would necessitate putting convoy into force in both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. On the face of it this would clearly call for far more than the 45 cruisers required for the Japanese threat above. Exactly how many more is, however, difficult to assess, because the estimate of 45 allowed for 10 cruisers in the Mediterranean and home waters, which latter become merged in the large force of cruisers allocated to the Home Fleet under the new standard proposals.38. It is hoped, moreover, that the provision of aircraft carriers to co-operate with the cruisers on the trade routes will lessen considerably the chance of a hostile raider escaping detection. This, in turn, should mean that fewer cruisers will be needed to safeguard a given area. Pending more accurate knowledge of the efficiency of a combination of cruisers and carriers on the trade routes (which is to be tested by special exercises), the Admiralty are prepared to accept the same figure of 45 cruisers for trade protection as was originally contem-plated for war with Japan alone.39.   The total cruiser strength necessitated by the new standard of naval strength is, therefore, as follows : -Main Fleet (Far East)............ 25Main Fleet (Home waters)      ......... 30Trade protection ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 45Total        ............     10040. Of this total of 100 it is considered that approximately 15 could be over-age, leaving 85 under-age cruisers to be maintained. Ultimately, this would involve an annual building programme of 4 ships, with a 5th &apos; ship every leap year.Destroyer Strength.41. Our total destroyer requirements can be divided into those which form part of the Main Fleet and would be  mployed tactically with the fleet in battle,
and those employed on local defence, escort or patrol work. The former must all consist of under-age destroyers, but a proportion of the latter, particularly those employed on local defence and A/S escort, can be over-age vessels.Requirements for the Eastern Fleet.42. As explained in paragraphs 6-14, Capital Ship Strength, a battlefleet of 10 ships is visualised in the Far East. About 5 flotillas would ordinarily be required for tactical employment with a fleet of this size, but, as with cruisers, the actual destroyer force needed is partly dependent on that of the enemy. Since Japan has 75 destroyers (i.e., 8% flotillas by our reckoning) building and projected exclusive of over-age vessels, it is considered that we should need not less than 7 flotillas in the East for employment with our fleet. This is a reduction of 2 flotillas on the force that has been assumed in previous calculation to be required in a Far Eastern war, a reduction that is justified by the definition of the new standard of naval strength wherein it is stated that &quot; the fleet in the Far East should be fully adequate to act on the defensive and to act as a strong deterrent, &amp;c.&quot; Of these flotillas, 2 should be of the new &quot; Tribal &quot; type which is being developed for the purpose of strengthening the gunpower of the flotillas, and it has been calculated is a sufficient set-off against the 23 destroyers of the &apos;&apos; Fubuki &apos;&apos; type in the Japanese fleet.43. In addition, 2 flotillas must be allowed for A/S duties or escort work in the Indian Ocean and Malacca Straits for the protection of important convoys of fleet oilers and supply ships which might be the object of Japanese submarine attack.44. Our minimum destroyer therefore, as follows : Eastern Fleet        ...       ...A/S duties and escort work Australian Local Defence ...Total    .........requirements for the Eastern area are,&quot; Tribal &quot; or   Under-age Over-age&quot; J &quot; Type. Destroyers. Destroyers. 2 flotillas        5 flotillas2 flotillas \ flotilla2 flotillas     4-5 flotillas     +Z&amp; flotillasHome Waters.45. The Home Fleet is expected to comprise 10 battleships for employment with which we need 5 modern flotillas. For the present it is assumed that these flotillas will all be of the ordinary type, but since Germany is, at present, building destroyers of 1,625 tons armed with 5-inch guns, the situation will require watching so as to ensure that the gunpower of the fleet flotillas does not become greatly inferior to that of a possible German destroyer force that may operate with their battlefleet.46. For patrol services in the North Sea and Dover Straits we require a force of 4 flotillas of which at least 2 flotillas should be of the &quot; Tribal &quot; or &quot; J &quot; type, so as to give superiority over the destroyers now being built by Germany. If Germany continues the construction of large destroyers it might be necessary that all 4 flotillas should be of the &quot;Tribal &quot; type, since the services on which they would be employed would be principally of the type of fighting that occurred in the Dover patrol and Harwich forces during the European War. For other local defence, escort and patrol work in the channel and the approaches to the British Isles, and for the protection of transports and important fleet communi-cations, another 3 flotillas of over-age destroyers would be required.47.- The calculation of the A/S forces required for the protection of our trade cannot be based solely on the size of the enemy submarine force that may attack it. It was demonstrated during the last war that, if unrestricted attack is embarked upon, the most effective protection is to use these forces as escorts in a general convoy system and thus make the submarine come to the A/S vessel. If the severity of the attack is sufficient to require the organisation of a general convoy system, the minimum number of escort vessels required is dependent directly on the number of convoys to be escorted. It is estimated that over 100 A/S escort vessels are required for a complete convoy system in Home waters, the Atlantic and Mediterranean.
48. Although Germany has adhered to the rules for submarine warfare contained in Part IV of the London Naval Treaty, 1930, we cannot rely for our security on her observance of these rules, and, further, in conditions to-day air attack on our shipping in home waters is a possibility. The Admiralty are consequently increasing their strength in escorting vessels by converting 4 flotillas of old destroyers for special A/S and A/A duties, but though these vessels will be retained, they cannot be counted as &apos;&apos; destroyers &apos;&apos; when assessing our strength in this type of vessel.49.   Our minimum requirements in Home waters, therefore, areHome FleetPatrol Duties ...Local Defence and A/S Escort: Tribal &quot; or &quot;J&quot; Type.2 flotillasUnder-age Destroyers.5 flotillas 2 flotillasOver-age Destroyers.31 flotillas50. become :-Total.........Our total requirements for total requirements-Eastern waters Home waters ...Total    ...2 flotillas   +1 flotillas   -l-3  flotillasFar East and Home waters therefore&apos;&apos; Tribal&apos;&apos; or Under-age Over-age&quot;J&quot; Type.

In all international discussions in the past 16 years we have stated our willingness to abolish submarines and failing abolition our policy has been to keep all submarine fleets down to the minimum, both in numbers and sizes of ships. In advocating this policy the Admiralty have had in mind that, while there are certain duties for which submarines are of great value to us and which they alone can perform, on the wider aspects the existence of the submarine is to our disadvantage, our interest being the supremacy of the surface ship.All proposals for numbers and tonnages of submarines put forward by the Admiralty in recent years have accordingly been based on the above considerations rather than on our strategical needs for this weapon if it is retained.52. It is now certain that the submarine will not be abolished nor can we obtain any limit to its numbers. The only thing we can obtain is an assurance (so far as the signed word can give such assurance) that submarines will not again be used in the inhuman manner in which they were used in the great war.53. It is consequently necessary for the first time for many years to consider our submarine requirements on a strategical basis. The submarine strength required by a country is almost entirely independent of the submarine strength of other countries (i.e., it is absolute, not relative), because these vessels in general act independently and not even in company with one another, and also because the submarine is not the answer to the submarine.54. Our submarine strength resulting from the policy outlined above was 50 vessels on the conclusion of the Treaty on the 31st December, 1936, and the Admiralty have always realised that this number did not meet our strategical requirement if the submarine was to be retained as a weapon of war-this was the case either on the old or the new standard of strength. The number of sub-marines required to meet our strategical requirements is examined below.55. In carrying out this examination the numbers required have been kept down to the minimum because of the reactions of our strength on that of Germany. Though it is very unlikely that Germany would embark on unrestricted submarine warfare again, it is desirable to limit her number as far as possible, especially as she may in certain circumstances have up to 100 per cent.
of our strength in this category. The estimate which follows is consequently confined to essentials and results in a smaller total than would be desirable on purely strategic grounds.56. In the Far East with our fleet on the defensive the submarine would be of great value in hampering the freedom of action of the Japanese fleet and obtaining information off the Japanese coasts which could not otherwise be obtained.57. It is also of great importance that submarines should be stationed in the Far East in time of peace, because they are the only vessels which could operate against the Japanese forces with much prospect of success in the period before the battlefleet reached the East and thereby they could contribute greatly to the security of our bases in that part of the world. (To-day our submarine strength in the East is large in comparison to our surface strength, and it would be larger still had more submarines been available in recent years.)58. The following submarines are considered the minimum to carry out the role required in the Far East: Patrol type        ......      .........      20Minelayers ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        359. In Home waters in a war with Germany approximately 7 submarines will be required on continuous patrol in the North Sea, to maintain which a total of approximately 30 submarines is required. Included in this number is a small allowance for special operations as well as routine patrol work.60. We also require a few submarines of a special type for work with the fleet, and a unit of minelaying submarines is also necessary.61. In addition, it is essential in war as in peace to keep a number of submarines for training work because of the specialised nature of the training involved- this training is not only in the use of the submarine itself, but in the training of anti-submarine forces which can only be carried out against actual submarines.62.   Our total minimum requirements in Home waters are accordingly : Patrol type        ...............      30Minelayers ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        6&quot; G &quot; Class (for work with fleet)       ......        3Submarine training       ...       ...       ...        7 \    ^Anti-submarine training...       ...       ...        7 j53Of the above, 7 training submarines can be over-age.63. In addition to the above forces in the Far East and Home waters, it is considered necessary for a small force of submarines to be based in the Mediterranean to meet probable operations in that sea (as was the case in the Great War). These submarines would also form a strategic reserve to proceed to the Far East or Home waters if required. The number of submarines required for this duty is 6.64.   Our total minimum submarine requirements are consequently :  Far East Patrol type .................. 20Minelayers ...      ...      ...      ...      ...... home waters Patrol type ...      ...      ...      ......... 30Minelayers ...      ...      ...      ...      ...... 6&quot; G&quot; class .................. 3Training ...      ...      ...      ...      - - -      - - - 14Mediterranean ...      ...      ...      ......      ... 6Total (of which 7 can be over-age)   ...      ... 82

(P) 12.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Defence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee.THE STRENGTH OF THE R.A.F. AND AIR DEFENCE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.THE Defence Plans Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence are about to review the programmes of the Services. It will be for that Committee to weigh all the considerations, political, strategic and financial; and to decide what programmes the Services are to work to in the future.2. I have placed before the Committee of Imperial Defence from time to time the considered appreciation of the Air Staff of the strength of the German Air Force, the plans of the German Air Ministry and the rate at which these plans are likely to reach fruition. At the same time the Industrial Intelligence Department of the Department of Overseas Trade have produced their periodical reviews of the output and capacity of the German aircraft industry. The most recent appreciations of the Air Staff and the Department of Overseas Trade are contained in D.P. (P) Paper 7 and C.I.D. Paper 1339-B. The Air Staff have also submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence considered apprecia-tions of the French and Italian Air Forces, the most recent papers being DP. (P) Papers 8 and 10.3. As the Committee are aware, these appreciations are founded on a mass of material, much of it of a very secret character; and certain checks which we have been able to apply have confirmed the accuracy of the plans attributed to the German Air Ministry and the rate at which these plans are being accomplished.4. In Cabinet Paper 18 (37) I emphasised the probability that the German Air Force would be expanded greatly beyond the size on which our existing Programme (Scheme F) is based, and outlined various measures which I thought we ought to take to combat this expansion.5. The conversations which took place between General Milch and the late Deputy Chief of the Air Staff cast doubt on this forecast; but the capacity of German industry, coupled with the scale on which aerodromes were being prepared and recruiting and training were progressing, made us in our turn sceptical as to whether General Milch was telling the truth about future intentions. In D.P.R. Paper 168 I accordingly asked for authority to proceed with initial steps in regard to aerodromes and recruiting, which would be essential if [16017] b
Scheme H were to be adopted subsequently, and which could not be improvised or accelerated at a later date. Events have shown that General Milch was not, in fact, telling the truth about future intentions.6. I feel, therefore, that it is my duty at this stage to put before the Plans Committee the careful appreciation of German Air Strength and plans which the Air Staff prepare &apos;ed immediately before General Milch&apos;s recent visit. This confirms the forecast given last July in D.P. (P) Paper 7, and states with such precision as is possible the size and character of the Force which they believe Germany is creating and the dates at which they consider the successive stages will be reached. I must add, and in this I am sure the Board of Trade will concur, that these plans are well within the capacity of the German industry; and that that industry is well equipped and adapted to maintain a Force of this size in war.7. Based on these assumptions I instructed the Air Staff to give their considered view of the size and character of the British Air Force which it is necessary to create and maintain as an. adequate counter to the German Force. The Committee are of course well aware of the Parliamentary pledges which have been given in this regard, which are conveniently summarised in Cabinet Paper 27 (37). I asked the Air Staff to make their recommendations without regard to these pledges and to treat the matter objectively in the light of the following considerations : What British Force would (a) be a reasonably effective deterrent, and (b) if war came, enable us to meet Germany as nearly as possible on equal terms.The attached Memorandum contains the considered opinion and recommendations of the Air Staff.8. At the close of his visit last week General Milch made a further state-ment about German progress and intention. He admitted that the German programme which, according to his earlier statement, would be completed by the Autumn of 1938, was already complete, though some squadrons were not fully equipped, and that in one particular (i.e., Army Co-operation squadrons) they had in fact exceeded their programme. (He alleged that he had given the spring and not the autumn as the probable date to Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, a correction which the Air Vice-Marshal would certainly not accept.) This new statement bears out completely the independent forecast and progress estimates made by the Air Staff.As regards the future, General Milch said that he hoped to use the next year or 18 months in &quot; consolidation.&quot; But he at once proceeded to an extensive qualification of this intention. During this period Germany &quot; might increase the strength of squadrons from 12 to 15 or 18 aircraft.&quot; This in itself would constitute a 50 per cent, expansion of the Force. He further added : &quot; General Goering is a man of big ideas and somewhat American in his outlook; and he might suddenly say &apos; Double the Air Force.&apos; If that happened, I should have to carry out his orders.&quot;General Milch promised that if an expansion of either kind took place, we should be informed. Judging by the past, I cannot place much reliance on this undertaking; and I think the information would be given after and not before the event; or at best when considerable progress had been made. Moreover, the fact that General Milch referred to doubling the Air Force in the way he did convinces me that this is already planned, though the date of execution may be uncertain. It will be observed that the doubling of the Force corresponds exactly with the. forecast of the Air Staff in the attached Memorandum. In all the circumstances I do not feel we can safely count on a German expansion less than that which General Milch has envisaged as possible, and which the Air Staff regard as probable.9. I would add this to the Air Staff appreciation. I believe my colleagues will readily accept the two considerations I have stated in paragraph 7 above as the correct basis on which we should estimate and work. But both considerations affect more than the Air Force. We cannot create an effective deterrent; and we cannot pretend that we could meet an opposing Force on equal terms, unless we are satisfied that our ground defences will bear adequate comparison with those of the enemy; and ground defences include both active defence by such means as guns, searchlights, balloon barrage and passive defence in the shape of air raid precautions.
10. The Air Staff have properly included in their review a strengthening&quot; of our Air Forces overseas. It will be for the Committee and the Cabinet to decide to what extent and in what priority these additions should be made. In this connection I must once again point out that, as my colleagues are only too well aware, we are in a very weak position in the Middle East, and that, whenever a crisis arises, we are faced with the dilemma of reducing our necessary strength at home or remaining relatively defenceless abroad.11. I have, of course, included in the memorandum an estimate of cost. It is indeed formidable. But great as the cost is, I am sure my colleagues will agree that I have no option but to ask that we should consider the facts and the views expressed by the Air Staff and take our decisions with those facts clearly before us.12. My advisers and I have given careful consideration to the date by which this programme might be achieved. We have based our estimates on the assumption that it will remain the policy of the Government to avoid the control of industry and interference with normal production to meet civil requirements. It will be realised how difficult it is to forecast production with certainty, having regard to the accumulating and conflicting claims of armament programmes and civil industry on labour and material.The best forecast I can give is that the full number of aircraft, &amp;c, including reserves, for the Metropolitan side of the programme, should be forthcoming by the summer of 1941. I make that forecast subject to the following conditions : (1) that all existing factories, including shadow factories, will be kept going to the full; (2) that the present large-scale use will continue to be made of the mass of sub-contractors; and (3) that another shadow factory will be erected for the production of airframes. I believe this latter to be necessary in order to get production by the given date, and this factory would be in itself a valuable contribution to the necessary war potential. It will also be necessary to arrange for an increase in capacity for the production of turrets, and for bomb filling, and probably for some other items of equipment.It is believed that the necessary aerodromes, stations, training establishments and depots could be created to fit in with this time-table. The last-mentioned elements include the provision of additional training schools, and, in addition, we should aim at increasing the number of R.A.F. Volunteer Reserve training centres from the 33 already approved to reach a number as near 50 as possible.13. Recruiting for the Scheme will certainly present many difficulties. The proposals in respect of the Metropolitan Air Force alone involve raising the strength of the R.A.F. as a whole to a total of 13,100 officers and airman pilots and 114.000 other airmen. With the completion of the proposals overseas, which, however, it is not proposed in the Scheme to implement until after the completion of the Home Defence requirements, these figures would rise to 13,400 officers and airman pilots and 118,000 other airmen. (The above figures include in all cases the R.A.F. personnel of the Fleet Air Arm, on the present ratio of manning. For purposes of estimate, I think it is right to make this inclusion, since, however recruited, the Navy and the Royal Air Force will be drawing for this purpose largely on the same source of supply.)My advisers and I find it very difficult to assess the rate at which recruits would be forthcoming to meet requirements of this order, particularly as the three Services will be increasingly in competition. It is probably the case that young-men will continue to come forward in large numbers both in this country and from the Empire for training- as pilots. If trade remains good, however, we shall have great difficulty in obtaining the necessary numbers of skilled men, while the recruitment of apprentices will present increasing difficulties owing to industrial competition; and, in any case, their training cannot be rushed. We shall also need all the publicity and allure we can deploy to get unskilled men in the numbers required.On the basis of the best evidence available, I have reached the conclusion that it must at present be regarded as improbable that we can achieve even the lower figures (i.e., those necessary to implement the Metropolitan side of the programme) by the summer of 1941, and that the highest figures we are likely to be able to obtain by that date would be of the order of 12,000 officers and airman pilots and 96,000 other airmen.[16017[ b 2
14. If this estimate is correct, two consequences follow. First, it is practically certain that, even if we were prepared by control or other means to compel a large-scale diversion of civil factories to armament work and so effect a speed-up in munitions production, our voluntary system of recruiting could not keep pace with such an accelerated programme. Secondly, it means that completion of part of the Metropolitan programme on the personnel side, as well as the Overseas proposals, must be postponed until after the summer of 1941. This is a situation which may have to be faced, but its implications in regard to our position vis-a-vis Germany are so grave that while there remains even a possibility that our recruiting estimates have been unduly pessimistic, I feel that we must aim at obtaining as nearly as possible the numbers necessary to complete the Metropolitan programme by the summer of 1941. But I must add that this would be quite impossible both as regards recruiting and training, unless a very early decision is taken.S.Air Ministry, October 27, 1937.
THE REQUISITE STANDARD OF AIR STRENGTH. Air Staff Memorandum.Part I. Home Defence.Policy.1. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the strength of the Metropolitan Air Force is that we shall maintain a Force of a strength and composition such as will&quot;&apos;&apos; constitute the most effective deterrent against German aggression.&quot;* This policy has been generally interpreted as implying a parity of striking power with Germany, as, for example, when Mr. Baldwin gave an assurance to the House of Commons (the 6th March, 1934) that &quot; this Government will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position of inferiority to any country within striking distance of our shores.&quot; The policy of parity was subsequently restated by the Defence Policy Require-ments Committee, and approved by the Cabinet as a basis of our air programme.2. In this connection it is necessary to draw attention to two factors which affect the practical application of this policy. In the first place, equality in air strength with a potential opponent does not necessarily involve exact numerical parity in first-line aircraft. Such things as the relative vulnerability to air attack of the two countries concerned and the relative completeness and efficiency of their passive defence organisations for the protection and control of their civil populations, the comparative offensive power of the types of bombing aircraft which they possess, and their respective ability to sustain their air efforts in war as connoted by the strength of their reserves in aircraft, personnel and productive power, must all be allowed for. The nature and extent of the commitments of the two air forces in respect of tasks other than purely air warfare, particularly for roles ancillary to the sea and land forces, must also be taken into account. Secondly, there is the difficulty of ascertaining the precise level in terms of first-line aircraft at which numerical parity should be sought, owing to the fact that foreign Powers, especially Germany, are careful to avoid the publication of details regarding the air programmes to which they are working, and more often than not are reluctant to impart accurate information on this score even on a basis of strict reciprocity. The only satisfactory method of approach to this question is, therefore, to formulate the closest possible estimate of German air strength, present and projected, taking all relevant factors and all available information into consideration, and then to decide on the strength and composi-tion of the air force which we require to enable us to engage on equal terms in a war with that country .The German Air Force.3. A narrative summary of the information which has come into the possession of the Air Ministry with regard to the progress of German air expansion since its inception, and to probable future developments, is contained in Appendix &quot;A.&quot; Consideration of the facts, and the implications, set out therein, have led to the following main conclusions :  (i) Previous Air Staff estimates of German intentions have, in the outcome, proved to be substantially correct, and the German 1935 and 1936 plans for air expansion were duly fulfilled in accordance with expectations.(ii) The German 1937 Plan, which involves an increase in her first-line strength up to 180 squadrons, or approximately 1,620 aircraft, is on the verge of completion. This is also in accordance with the Air Staffs forecast.(iii) On 1st October, 1937, the German Air Force possessed at least 750bombers with the necessary range and performance to attack objec-tives in this country. This gives her a large margin of superiority in air striking power over Great Britain at the present time.* D.P.K. (D.R.) 9, paragraph 30.
(iv) There is every reason to believe that Germany intends to continue herair expansion until 1939 at the same rate as that aimed at, and achieved, in her last annual programme, and that she is fully capable of doing so.(v) All the evidence, direct and indirect, which has come into the possessionof the Air Staff, points to the conclusion that by the end of 1939 Germany will possess a first-line strength of 3,240, including an air striking force of 1,458 bombers, and that this will be backed by reserves and1 by a productive capacity adequate for the effective employment of the German Air Force at full strength in war.The British Air Programme.4. The actual approved programme of expansion (known as Scheme &quot; F &quot;) to which the Air Ministry are now working involves the provision by April 1939 of a total first-line metropolitan air strength of 1,736 aircraft, including 1,022 bombers, with adequate war reserves behind them. This programme was approved by the Cabinet in February 1936. Subsequent to the inception of this programme, the Air Staff received certain information which led them to conclude that by April 1939 the German first-line strength would comprise 2,500 aircraft, of which it was at that time estimated that 1,700 would be bombers. In January 1937 the Air Ministry submitted proposals for raising our own first-line strength to 2,492 aircraft, including a total of 1,631 bombers by April 1939, and for increasing the bomber strength to 1,701 as soon after that date as possible. These proposals* (known as Scheme &quot; H &quot;) involved using reserves in first-line units and the retention at home of certain squadrons intended for overseas, and had the object of creating in the first instance the increased deterrent of an ostensibly larger air striking force, while the completion of the war reserves for this enlarged first-line strength was deferred until 1941. Scheme &quot; H,&quot; however, did not receive Cabinet approval, although authority was given to proceed with the formulation of preliminary arrangements to facilitate the carrying-out of the modified plan at a later date, should such a course be decided upon.5. As stated in paragraph 3 (v), the considered estimate of the Air Staff now is that by the end of 1939 Germany will possess a first-line strength of 3,240, including 1,458 bombers. The latter figure, which is lower than the previous estimate of 1,700 referred to above, has been reached after eliminating from the total figure for the German air striking force those types classed as &quot; dive-bomber &quot; squadrons which, owing to the limited range of action of the aircraft with which they are now equipped, cannot be effectively employed in attacks on this country. Nevertheless, on our part, the air strength visualised under Scheme &quot; F &quot; still represents our present aim. This force of 1,736 aircraft is to be organised in 124 squadrons, and except for one squadron units up to that total have already been formed. The stage which has now been reached represents, however, little more than the facade of our projected structure of air defence, and, although the public announcement of the formation of 123 squadrons may have some measure of deterrent effect against the possibility of German aggression, our metropolitan air force as now constituted could, at present, provide and maintain in mobilisable squadrons, fit for sustained war operations, only a proportion of the total effective strength envisaged for the completed programme. This state of affairs is, nevertheless, inevitable, and marks no departure from the original plan which aimed at creating first the outward and visible sign of first-line strength, and its endowment at a later stage with the reserves and equipment required for its effective and sustained employment in war.6. When Scheme &quot; F &quot; was approved in February 1936, it was hoped that it could be fully completed by. April 1939. It had, however, always been recognised that the capacity of the aircraft industry would be taxed to the utmost to provide the full numbers of aircraft within that time, and it soon became clear that completion could not be secured until several months after April 1939. This deferment was brought to the. notice of the Cabinet in February 1937. t Moreover, our anti-aircraft artillery and searchlight defences will admittedly not even be within sight of completion to the approved scale until 1941 a scale which, in the opinion of the,Home Defence Sub-Committee, does not provide* DPR. 165.f CP. 18 (37).
sufficient security, and which represents less than half the &apos;&apos; Ideal &apos;&apos; requirement^ It is clear, therefore, that while we are to-day in a position of grave inferiority to Germany in effective air strength, the completion of our present programme will not provide an adequate remedy, and that by 1939 we shall still have failed to achieve that equality in air striking power with Germany which represents the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the subject of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s pledge to the country. The probable situation by that date, in the light of the best available forecast for Germany, and at the most favourable estimate for ourselves, will, as regards first-line aircraft, be as follows : December 1939.Great Britain.   Germany.Total First Line     ......... 1,736 3,240Air Striking Force......... 1,022 1,458A additional Requirements.7. In assessing the full measure of air strength which we require to remedy the deficiency indicated above, the following factors must be taken into consideration : In the first place, equality in air striking power with Germany does not, as already stated, necessitate equality in total first-line strength. It will be observed that the difference between the German total of 3,240 and the figure of 1,458 which represents the probable strength of her air striking force amounts to 1,782. The Air Staff are not in a position to estimate with any accuracy the number of fighter aircraft which are intended for territorial air defence in GeiTiiany, but this figure of 1,782 must comprise many fighter squadrons for that purpose. A further large proportion will consist of army co-operation, reconnaissance, ground attack and fighter aircraft provided for direct co-operation with the German armies, and present information indicates that the majority of these types will have insufficient range and performance for employment on long-range attacks on this country, even if it were desired to use them in this manner. As regards ourselves, adequate provision for army co-operation duties has already been included in our existing programme, and the number of fighter aircraft which we require for local air defence is governed by the extent, importance and vulnerability of the areas to be defended and bears no relation to German fighter strength. As far as air forces are concerned, therefore, the sum and substance of the equality which we require lies in the number and offensive power of the bomber types which constitute the respective air striking forces.8. Another matter to which reference must be made is the extent to which reliance on French assistance can serve to modify our need for equality with Germany in air striking power. Should we engage in hostilities in alliance with France, the operations of the French air force, although they would inevitably be directed with the primary object of ensuring the security of their own country, would no doubt contribute in some measure to our own. But the latest information regarding the state of the French aircraft industry has led the Sub-Committee on Industrial Intelligence in Foreign Countries to conclude that &apos;&apos; the war potential of the French Air Force is, for the present, reduced in a most grave manner,&quot;! a state of affairs which may not be entirely remedied for some time to come, and which must weaken any reliance which we might place on assistance from that quarter. Further, should Germany launch a large-scale land offensive against France, she would, as pointed out in paragraph 7 above, be able to employ a very powerful force of first-line aircraft in support of her Continental operations without any weakening of her main bomber force. In this connection it has already been accepted! that, even when faced with Great Britain and France in alliance, Germany might, in the hope of gaining a quick decision over one of her opponents, turn the full weight of her air striking force against this country alone. The probability, and the value to us, of any diversionary effect which might result from Soviet participation in a struggle against Germany is too uncertain to be taken seriously into account. Moreover, in view of the anti-Communist agreement between Germany and Japan, and the existence of the Rome-Berlin &quot; axis,&quot; there is more than a possibility that Germany will not have to fight alone, a contingency which goes far to discount the wisdom of relying, even in part, for our security on the help of possible allies.* C.I.D. 255-A. t C.I.D. 1344-B. % G.G.S. 549.
9. In these circumstances, it would be most unsound to depend for the protection of this country against air attack on the assistance which might in certain circumstances be afforded by the operations of allied air forces. In the past, on occasions when the safety of the Empire has been gravely threatened, we have never relied on the assistance of a foreign navy to give us the measure of security required, and it seems unlikely that a policy of partial dependence on the air power of a probable, though by no means certain, ally to give us security against a contingency so menacing as unrestricted air attack by a superior enemy can commend itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government. It may be remarked that the general principle underlying the following quotation from a speech made by Sir Edward Grey in 1912, which has already been referred to by the Admiralty in paragraph 33 of Paper D.P. (P) 3, applies with equal force to the question of the standard of air strength which we should maintain as it does to the problem of sea power : &quot; In the first place, you must not rely upon your foreign policy to protect the United Kingdom. That is to say, if you let your margin of naval strength in Home waters fall below that which may be brought to bear against you rapidly, you are setting foreign policy a task which you ought not to set it. The risk of an attack on the United Kingdom, stronger in force than we could meet with the ships we keep in Home waters, is one not to be settled by diplomacy.&quot;10. After a most careful examination of all available information relating directly and indirectly to the progress and ultimate aim of the German air programme, and of all the factors bearing on our own air defence problem, the Air Staff estimate that our minimum requirements for security are a total Metropolitan first-line strength of 2,331 aircraft, including an air striking force of 1,442 bombers. Moreover, it is of the utmost importance that this total strength should be provided as rapidly as possible. The ideal achieve-ment would be its completion by the end of 1939 to accord with the German programme, and it should in any event be provided as soon after that date as is found to be practicable. A force of this strength, which would be organised in 154 squadrons, represents an increase over Scheme &quot;F&quot; by 22 squadrons (462 aircraft) of bomber types, 8 additional fighter squadrons (112 aircraft) and includes certain percentage increases in squadron establishments. Full details of this proposal, including the reasons for the increase in fighter strength, are given in Appendix &quot; B,&quot; Table I. As a corollary to this further air expansion, it is essential that the existing programme of provision of ground anti-aircraft defences and the establishment of our passive defence organisation on a fully adequate basis should also be greatly accelerated.11. The new programme suggested above should, if approved and completed in time, provide a reasonable deterrent to German aggression, and should enable us, if the worst should occur, to engage on equal terms with a German air force of the size and strength which it is anticipated that she will possess by the end of 1939. If, however, it is found possible during the course of the next two years to conclude any satisfactory form of air limitation agreement, or if it becomes apparent that Germany is not, in fact, building up to the strength anticipated, it will be possible to modify the programme by decreasing the number of first-line aircraft in squadrons to the required level. At the same time, organisation in 154 squadrons must be regarded as an essential requirement, in order that the full programme, particularly the bomber strength of 1,442 aircraft, may be fulfilled according to plan if, as seems probable, no opportunity for reduction presents itself. Further, the possibility that the programme for the German air striking-force may eventually be found to be greater than anticipated must not be lost sight of, since this would necessitate a corresponding increase in our own.Readiness for War. -12. It is of vital importance that this revised air programme should be completed, including, the.provision of war reserves, as nearly as possible part passu with the German programme. Without such reserves the imposing display of a large first-line strength will in the event of war avail us but little, and this shallow defensive front will inevitably be quickly shattered by the reiterated blows* D.P.R. (D.E.) 9. f Scheme &quot; F &quot; prior to modification.
struck by an opponent who possesses, as Germany undoubtedly will possess, the means to sustain and exploit his initial offensive. Moreover, it must be emphasised that if we are to be able to meet the first attacks in adequate strength, and to develop an effective counter-offensive before it is too late, every possible step must be taken to ensure that our metropolitan air forces attain the highest possible degree of operational efficiency, and are in a constant state of readiness to exert the maximum effort, both in attack and defence, on the outbreak of war. In air warfare initiated by an aggressor, there will be no period available for mobilization of the defences beyond a few hours at most, and it is self-evident that our state of readiness in the air must be at least equal, if not superior, to that of our naval forces. Such a state of readiness cannot be achieved without substantial increases in the existing peace establishments of Royal Air Force units and formations, and this requirement has been allowed for in the estimate of the cost of these new proposals which is given in Appendix &quot; C.&quot;Production of A ir Material.13. It is obvious that great difficulties exist in the way of adjusting the present position in respect of the output of aircraft and ancillary material to the needs of a new and enlarged programme, and of one in relation to which the time factor is of the first importance. On the present basis of output, as the Secretary of State for Air has already pointed out,* the production of the number of aircraft required to implement Scheme F will certainly not be secured until several months after the date (April 1939) which was contemplated when that scheme was first approved. To carry out an air programme at the rate, and on the scale, which defence considerations now require, brings us to the situation the possibility of which was anticipated by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence at the 169th Meeting of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. The relevant portion of the Minutes of that Meeting reads as follows : &quot; Sir Thomas Inskip hoped that he would be kept in close touch with fresh information received by the Staffs of the Services regarding the re-armament of Germany. This was a matter on which he wished to be kept fully posted. As an example of the necessity for this, he pointed out that the Cabinet had decided that the reconditioning of the Services was to be carried out without interference with normal trade. If, however, Germany re-armed with dangerous speed, it might be necessary for us to accelerate our own pro-gramme, modify or reverse the Cabinet decision, and pass from a peace system of production into some form of war system.&quot;Further, it is material to point out that productive capacity has a vital bearing on the question of our war potential generally. The replacement of losses and wastage can be effected for a certain period by drawing on stored reserves of aircraft and equipment, but the ability to sustain and to develop our war effort must depend in the long run on the speed with which factory output can catch up with the war demand. Moreover, a large productive capacity capable of even further expansion with the minimum of delay is a stronger asset, and probably far less expensive, than a large stored reserve of aircraft which may, when the time comes, be obsolescent. There is no doubt whatever that in this respect Germany is already far ahead of the United Kingdom in her preparations.Other Essential Requirements.14. The further measures of air expansion suggested in the foregoing para-graphs are those which, in the opinion of the Air Staff, are essential to establish our air forces on the required basis of strength and preparedness for war. They are, however, confined to those matters for which the Air Ministry is primarily responsible. There are others of parallel importance which cannot be neglected. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that air forces are only one element in air defence, and the strength, efficiency and readiness for war of the fighter and bomber squadrons of the Royal Air Force must be matched by an equal standard in the ground anti-aircraft defence units, and supplemented by the most thorough organisation of the civil population in general and of our war industry in particular to withstand the effects of air attack.   It would be a most dangerous* CP. 18 (37).[16017] c
mistake to measure relative air strengths in terms of military aircraft alone, and to ignore the vitally important factor of relative vulnerability an axiom which is most cogently illustrated by the facts and conclusions set out in the recent memorandum on German Anti-Aircraft Defences submitted by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Berlin.*Stimmary of Recommendations (Home Defence).15. The programme which is now submitted for consideration in connection with our metropolitan air strength can be summarised briefly as follows : (i) The existing programme of 124 squadrons to be increased by 30 squadrons so as to provide a first-line metropolitan air strength of 2,331 aircraft, including 1,442 bombers. This increase by 22 bomber and 8 fighter squadrons is required to achieve an air striking force not inferior to the German air striking force, and to strengthen the fighter defences up to the minimum requirements for security.(ii) To enable the additional squadrons (with their appropriate scales of reserves of men and material) to be provided at the earliest possible date, the policy at present determining the productive capacity of industry should be reconsidered.(iii) In order to achieve the required degree of readiness and operational efficiency, and to counterbalance the probable lack of any appreciable period of mobilisation of air defence forces should war occur, approval to be given for certain increases in the peace-time personnel establishments of Royal Air Force units and formations at Home.(iv) As an essential corollary to this further air expansion, steps to be takento accelerate the existing programme of provision of ground anti-aircraft defences, and the establishment of our passive defence organisation on a fully adequate basis, with a view to their completion as early as possible after 1939.The estimated cost of implementing proposals (i) to (iii) above by the summer of 1941, the earliest practicable date under existing circumstances, is included in the total figures given in the financial statement at Appendix &quot; C.&quot; If it were to be decided that every effort must be made to complete the enlarged programme by an earlier date, the most drastic measures would be required involving a very considerable increase in capital expenditure. In view of the fact that the proposals contained in Paper D.P.R. 168 were accorded Cabinet approval in February of this year, certain steps towards the recruitment of additional personnel and the acquisition of land for aerodromes beyond the immediate requirements of Scheme &quot;F&quot; have already been undertaken. But while the acquisition of the total number of new aerodromes required is not a matter of insuperable difficulty, the problem of meeting full requirements from a recruiting point of view will be a very serious one.16. As a conclusion to Part I of this Paper it is desired to express most strongly the supreme importance of concentrating all our energies in the spheres of finance, industry and man-power, first on those components of our defensive system which are really vital to our existence. It is manifestly vital that our Navy should be fully adequate to ensure that the arteries of the Empire remain uncut, and that the United Kingdom by which the Empire stands and falls  is not defeated by lack of food or of those essential raw materials for which we depend upon our seaborne trade. It is to-day no less vital that our Air Force and the anti-aircraft units of the Army should be fully adequate to secure this country against what is, after all, the only form of attack which, failing adequate defences, may be decisive in a matter of weeks. The Air Staff are not unmindful of, the complexity and gravity of the political, social and other issues which this problem presents. It is difficult, indeed, to see (even assuming the most drastic degree of State intervention and control) how a standard of air strength, as expressed particularly in terms of aircraft and other forms of material which would be necessary to provide any adequate military deterrent against the risk of attack by Germany, could be attained as early as 1939, by* D.P.K. 219.
Part II. Overseas.17. The situation disclosed by the foregoing review of our air situation at Home represents, of course, by far the most serious commitment from the air point of view that the Empire has to face. Nevertheless, the air strength which we shall possess in Overseas Commands on the completion of the present expansion programme will, owing to changes in the situation which have occurred since that programme was devised, still be seriously inadequate to meet many of the possible contingencies which may arise, and will not constitute a satisfactory standard of strength for Imperial air defence.The Middle East and North-East A frica.18. It has to be recognised that our present standard of air strength in the Mediterranean and the Middle East would be completely inadequate to meet attack by Italy. Even if that contingency is ignored -a most dangerous proceeding at the present juncture our air strength in that area, present and projected, is insufficient for other possible commitments. The air forces which we now maintain in Malta, Egypt, Palestine, Iraq, the Sudan, Aden and East Africa, represented in the past the minimum requirements for security, against relatively insignificant dangers, under conditions which are now completely out of date. They comprise a total of 15 squadrons, of which 10 are bomber types. Moreover, two squadrons out of the five stationed in Iraq are earmarked as immediate and essential reinforcements for Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan.19. As far back as February 1936 the increased defence commitment involved in the rise of a powerful and potentially hostile Italy astride our Imperial communications in the Mediterranean and Middle East was fully recognised, but the Defence Requirements Report on which Scheme &quot; F &quot; was based made no specific provision for meeting this threat. In recommending that Report to the Cabinet the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee added the rider that -&quot;. . . . if our situation vis-a-vis Italy is to remain on an unsatisfactory basis, there will be additional responsibilities which all three Services will have to face.&quot;*Since then our relations with Italy, impaired by the Abyssinian affair and exacerbated by the course of events in connection with the Spanish Civil War, have steadily deteriorated, and it has long been recognised that, failing a complete restoration of friendly relations, our defence situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East would require a thorough re-examination, and probably substantial reinforcement, from the point of view of all three Services. The present weakness of our local resources from the land and air point of yiew is clearly revealed in the interim Appreciation completed in July of this year by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee,! and the following extract from paragraph 51 of that document may be quoted : -&quot; We can here summarise the situation in general terms by saying that our own local air forces in the Middle East are opposed to the Italian Metropolitan and Colonial air forces, and that until reinforcements can reach Egypt from home we would be outnumbered in the Mediterranean by 6 to 1.&quot;In their covering Memorandum to the Appreciation,! the Chiefs of Staff drew attention to the fact that there are at present no fighter aircraft or ground anti-aircraft defences in Egypt, a deficiency which they regard as serious and as requiring an immediate remedy in the event of an emergency.* D.P.R. (D.R.) 9. [16017]! C.O.S. 603 (J.P.)! C.I.D. 1346-B.c 2which year it is assumed that Germany might be in a position to strike. But this fact affords no reason for our failing to take every possible further measure to bridge this gap, and the Air Staff strongly represent the desirability of the larger programme being approved, and of every effort being made to complete it as soon after 1939 as possible.
20. But apart from the Italian danger, other factors have arisen which adversely affect the adequacy of our provision for defence in that area. Events in Iraq, now an independent Kingdom and a member-State of the League of Nations, have of late given rise to some doubt whether the political stability of that country will be maintained and developed to the extent which is necessary for our Imperial interests. We are now in Treaty relations with both Iraq and Egypt, and have undertaken to go to their assistance should either of them be the victim of aggression by a third party. Moreover, the internal stability of both these States is of the utmost importance to us, a matter over which we have now renounced the means of immediate and effective control, but which may, nevertheless, require active intervention on our part should any serious degree of deterioration occur. Furthermore, the situation in Palestine is far from satisfactory, and it is apparent that our relations with the Moslem world, both in territories which lie under our jurisdiction or sphere of influence and in the regions adjacent thereto, contain the germs.of possible future troubles.21. The mobility and speed of movement of aircraft operating over organised air routes are unquestioned, but when the strength of the air forces maintained in any one area is the minimum or less than the minimum required for local security, the advantage of being able to reinforce other threatened areas with the least possible delay is nullified by the risk of weakening the Command from which the reinforcements are drawn below the limit of reasonable safety. In this connection it must be remembered that our air defence arrangements in the Middle East, India and the Far East are at present closely interconnected by a system of mutual air reinforcement schemes. All our defence plans have hitherto provided for the air reinforcement of Singapore immediately on the outbreak of any war in which the Empire is involved. Two squadrons from Iraq and two squadrons from India are earmarked for the purpose. But recent plans to meet an emergency in Egypt also call for air reinforcements from Iraq and India, and it is most unlikely that both commitments could be met simultaneously. Again,&apos;should we become involved in hostilities with Italy, the importance of the Red Sea route and the threat of air action against it from Italian East Africa would necessitate the air reinforcement of Aden, but, again, this could only be effected in time at the expense of Iraq or of Egypt itself. Thus, whether our Imperial interests were to be threatened either by Italy, by a general disturbance in the Moslem world, or by both these dangers simultaneously, or, alternatively, by internal or external dangers affecting India, the move of reinforcements to the danger area would, under prevailing circumstances, be certain to denude some part of the Middle East of air forces to a dangerous, and possibly fatal, extent.22. In view of the situation outlined above, the Air Staff recommend that action should be taken at the earliest possible moment to strengthen the air forces which we maintain in the area in question by increasing the establishment of all bomber (other than bomber-transport) squadrons envisaged under Scheme &quot; F &quot; for Egypt, Palestine, the Sudan and Aden from 12 to 21 initial equipment aircraft, with the exception of one of the existing bomber squadrons in Egypt which should be converted to a fighter squadron with 21 I.E. aircraft. The reduction in the number of bomber squadrons in Egypt which is involved in this conversion should be compensated for in the manner indicated in paragraph 28 below. In addition, one fighter squadron of 14 initial equipment aircraft should be provided at Aden for the close defence of the fortress against the possibility of air attack from Italian East Africa, and to assist in the protection from air attack of merchant ship convoys in the vicinity of the port.West A frica.23. The strategic importance of Freetown in the event of the adoption of the Cape route in war has recently been fully appreciated, and at the 296th Meeting, held on the 5th July, 1937, the Committee of Imperial Defence decided to approve in principle the provision of a bomber-i-econnaissance squadron earmarked for Freetown, an aerodrome near that port and landing ground facilities along the West African air route. This requirement must, therefore, be included in the general conspectus now submitted.
The Far East.24. The share of the air arm in the task of preserving the security of our interests in the Far East consists of co-operation with the other Services in the defence of Singapore and Hong Kong against all forms of attack, and with the Navy in the protection of our sea communications in Far Eastern waters.25. The Air strength envisaged in the present approved programme for Singapore would probably be adequate if it were not for two factors. The first of these is the dependence placed upon the timely arrival of four reinforcing squadrons from Iraq and India, which is considered essential to complete the minimum requirement for the security of the base in war. This reinforcing scheme was reasonable and adequate under past conditions, but it was evolved at a time when the international situation, and the number and strength of our potential enemies west of India, were very different to those prevailing to-day. Moreover, the despatch of the two squadrons from India must always be contingent upon the situation in that country warranting their release. The Air Staff believe that, in fact, the two bomber squadrons concerned would certainly be made available unless a wholly unpredictable situation should arise, although the recent upheavals on the North West Frontier permit some doubt on that score. In these circumstances reliance on present arrangements to provide the minimum total number of squadrons which it has already been fully agreed are required for the security of Singapore in war involves a very dangerous risk, and it is considered that at least two extra squadrons should be available overseas for this purpose.26. The second factor affecting Singapore is the recent modification of the naval reconnaissance plan in connection with the defence of the Base. The necessity for adequate reconnaissance to givesdue warning of the approach of hostile forces including carrier-borne air forces during the period before the arrival of our Main Fleet, is so obvious as to require no emphasis. When the existing air programme for Singapore was recommended and approved, it was the agreed policy of the Naval and Air Staffs that these reconnaissance require-ments would be -met by the employment of both Naval and Air forces the provision of a distant screen some 500 to 550 miles from the Base being undertaken by the vessels of the China squadron, supported by an inner system of patrols hy reconnaissance aircraft. This arrangement no longer holds good, and the Admiralty have recently confirmed that the limited strength of the naval forces normally maintained in Far Eastern waters precludes their employment on distant reconnaissance in the face of the scale of protection which the enemy would probably give to his expedition; and that no reliance can therefore be placed on naval measures designed to obtain information at any great distance from the Base. The possibility of the replacement of surface vessels by aircraft for distant reconnaissance purposes involves certain difficulties, notably owing to the scarcity of suitably placed landing ground or alighting facilities north-eastward of Singapore, and the precise number required must be the subject of further investigation. Additional aircraft will, however, almost certainly be required, probably amounting to the equivalent of at least one general reconnaissance landplane squadron.27. The problem of the effective defence of Hong Kong against the maximum scale of air attack which Japan could bring to bear against the fortress and base is virtually insoluble. Moreover, our policy with regard to its defence, in the light of the lapse of those clauses of the Washington Treaty concerning the status quo in the Pacific, has not yet been decided. The question cannot, there-fore, usefully be discussed in this Paper, but it should none the less be appreciated that if it is eventually decided that Hong Kong is to be re-fortified and, in war, defended to the last, some further increases in the air strength already approved for that station will probably be essential.The Need for an Overseas Strategic Air Reserve.28. From the air defence point of view we cannot rely for the protection of our Imperial interests overseas on the certain despatch, nor on the timely arrival, of reinforcements from our metropolitan air forces. If those interests were seriously threatened, the risk of general conflagration would probably make it necessary to keep our home defence air force at full strength as an insurance
against the risk of hostile intervention by Germany. Even if air reinforcements could be spared from home, we might and for some years certainly shall be unable to move them by air from England to Egypt, while their passage by sea through the Mediterranean would be extremely hazardous, and their despatch by any other route would involve serious delay. Since, therefore, the air strength which is now recommended for the various overseas Commands represents the minimum required for a reasonable degree of local security, it is clear that there is an urgent need for a strategic reserve of air forces located outside the United Kingdom in peace. Such a reserve might consist of a number of squadrons earmarked for certain specific commitments which would constitute the first call upon them should necessity arise. At the same time they should be located in peace in an area suitably situated as a strategic centre, so that any or all of them could be employed for the reinforcement of any overseas Command in the event of an emergency which rendered such alternative employment desirable. On this basis the reserve would consist of a minimum of four squadrons; two primarily earmarked for Singapore with a view to reducing by a half the rein-forcing commitment at present laid on Iraq and India, one earmarked for despatch to Freetown should circumstances render the protection of the Cape route a matter of first importance, and one to be sent to Egypt if required to compensate for the reduction in the number of bomber squadrons permanently stationed there, which is involved in the proposal to convert an existing bomber squadron to fighters.29. As regards the location of this reserve, it is true that full facilities for the permanent accommodation of the squadrons in question could not conveniently be found in Egypt or Iraq in view of the terms of our existing treaties with those countries, but admirable base aerodromes for permanent occupation could be found in our East African Colonies. Kenya, in particular, offers many advantages, since there is no serious external defence problem such as would necessitate the provision of a strong army garrison for the land defence of the air bases, climatic conditions are good, it is a British possession well served by sea and air communications, and is a good strategic centre. Moreover, we may hope with some confidence that in due course South Africa will be ready and able to despatch air squadrons to co-operate with the Royal Air Force in the Middle East in the event of a serious emergency, and on this score alone the location of Imperial squadrons in East Africa would be very advantageous in view of the strategic development of the air route from the Cape which would result. On the other hand, it might be found desirable to locate a part of the strategic reserve further eastwards, possibly in Burma, but this is a matter which will require detailed investigation. The need for the reserve itself is unquestionable. A bomber-transport squadron is required as an integral part of the reserve to enable reinforcing flights to be carried out with the maximum speed, and to facilitate the transport of the personnel and stores required to enable the squadrons to operate efficiently on arrival at their destination. An additional aircraft depot is also required. The need for this extra establishment is already becoming pressing in connection with the maintenance of the over-seas squadrons envisaged in the existing programme. If the increases now recommended are approved, its provision will become essential.War Reserves.30. The recommendation regarding war reserves which was contained in the Third Report of the Defence Requirements Sub-Committee,* and subse-quently approved by the Cabinet, applied only to the Metropolitan Air Force, and Scheme &quot; F &quot; makes no provision for this requirement in respect of air forces permanently stationed overseas. As regards aircraft there is at present no serious deficiency under this head, as provision for normal requirements for over-seas squadrons in peace is practically sufficient to cover estimated war reserve requirements as well. Other reserves of war material such as bombs, ammunition, petrol and maintenance stores are, however, required in considerably greater quantities than are provided-for by peace-time stocks. While the intensity of the operational effort likely to,&quot;be exerted by overseas squadrons in war, and consequently their anticipated rate of consumption of material may in certain instances be lower than that expected in home defence operations, this reduction*&apos;d.E,C. 37.
Is largely counter-balanced by the length of time required for reprovisioning overseas Commands. War reserves for overseas air forces are therefore needed on a scale approximately equal to that authorised for squadrons stationed at Home, and an appropriate item to cover outstanding requirements in this respect has been included in the statement of estimated costs contained in Appendix. &quot; C.&quot;Summary of Recommendations [Overseas).31. The additional measures now recommended to remedy the most serious deficiencies overseas which have resulted from the course of events during the past few years, and to provide a, standard of air strength outside the United Kingdom reasonably adequate to meet our Imperial Commitments, can be sum-marised as follows : (i) The following additional squadrons over and above the overseas strength envisaged in Scheme &quot;F&quot; to be provided as soon as possible after the Home Defence requirements specified in Part I of this paper have been met Aden 1 Fighter Squadron (14 IE.) Singapore 1 Gen. Reconnaissance Sqdn. (14 I.E.)Strategic Air Reserve (Kenya) 3 Bomber Squadrons (14 I.E.)1 Gen. Reconnaissance Sqdn. (14 I.E.)1 Bomber-Transport Sqdn. (12 I.E.)(ii) The establishment of all bomber (other than bomber-transport) squadronsenvisaged under Scheme &quot;F&quot; for Egypt, Palestine, the Sudan, and Aden to be increased from 12 to 21 initial equipment aircraft, with the exception of one of the existing bomber squadrons in Egypt which should be converted to a fighter squadron with 21 I.E. aircraft.(iii) Landing grounds and air facilities to be established in Cyprus, at PortSudan, Freetown, along the West African air route, and in the vicinity of Aden, to facilitate air reinforcing movement generally and the operation of the strategic air reserve in particular.(iv) An overseas Aircraft Depot and Storage Park to be established in asuitable central position, if possible in the same area as the permanent bases of the strategic air reserve, to facilitate the maintenance of overseas air forces generally.(v) War reserves to be provided for overseas squadrons on a scale approxi-mately equal to that authorised for squadrons at Home.32. The effect of the above recommendations on the strength and dispositions of our overseas air forces is shown in Table II of Appendix &quot; B,&quot; and an estimate of the capital and recurring costs involved has been included in the total figures given in Appendix &quot; C.&quot;Part III. Trade Defence.33. In the foregoing review of our air defence situation at home and over-seas, no account has been taken of requirements in aircraft for specific tasks in connection with the defence of seaborne trade. As regards war against Germany, it has already been decided (CCS. 488 (J.P.)) that, as far as the protection of trade is concerned, &quot; the major part to be played by the Royal Air Force will -consist of the general offensive to deal with the threat from aircraft, surface or submarine raiders at its source.&quot; Whatever standard of bomber strength is decided upon as adequate for the general air counter-offensive in the light of the factors outlined in Part I of this Paper, will, therefore, include the requirements for this particular commitment. An additional number of aircraft will, however, be needed for reconnaissance and for the local protection of shipping by means of air escorts, anti-submarine patrols, &amp;c, although some provision has already been made for this purpose in the current air expansion scheme, which envisages the maintenance at Home of 7 general reconnaissance squadrons and 6 flying-boat squadrons.
34. As regards war in the Far East, the problem of the defence of trade is still under review by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee, and until their investigation has been completed it is not possible to formulate a statement of the air requirements involved. Here again some provision has already been made in the existing air programme; and in addition to the air forces which are to be stationed at Singapore and Hong Kong, general reconnaissance squadrons are to be located at Penang, Ceylon and Aden, primarily for co-operation in the defence of shipping in the Indian Ocean and adjacent waters. Nevertheless, the whole question of trade protection in this theatre is a very complex one compared to that which may arise in the home area, and it appears probable that the existing scale of provision for this purpose may prove inadequate as far as air forces are concerned.35. Finally, it must be remembered that the situation vis-a-vis Italy con-stitutes a serious threat to our sea communications through the Mediterranean, and that in any war in which that country was hostile to ourselves we might be compelled to divert the whole, or at any rate the major part, of our commercial shipping, plying between the United Kingdom, India and the Far East, to the Cape route. In such circumstances air co-operation in the task of preserving the security of our trade routes along both the West and East coasts of Africa would be a virtual necessity. Some provision for this has already been recommended (paragraph 23 of Part II) in the shape of a permanent squadron earmarked for Freetown in West Africa, but this might not be sufficient. If circumstances were such that we could make use of air bases situated in territory belonging to Portugal, it would be greatly to our advantage to have squadrons available to operate from places such as the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde Islands and Angola. Further, unless the Government of the Union prove willing to include oversea reconnaissance type aircraft in their own air expansion programme, we might have to despatch an Imperial squadron to South Africa for this purpose in war. Additional squadrons for employment in the manner suggested above would have to be stationed either in the United Kingdom or form part of the general overseas strategic air reserve in peace.Recommendations.36. While it is impossible to put forward any concrete proposals in connection with additional air forces for Trade Defence at the present time, it is considered that a minimum of four additional squadrons may be required for this purpose. Of these, it is estimated that two should be of the General Reconnais-sance class, and that two should be additional fighter squadrons to supplement the normal dispositions of our home fighter defences for the protection of convoys against air attack in the most dangerous areas. This, however, is a matter which cannot be made the subject of any definite recommendations until the further investigation of detailed requirements has been completed. The probability of an additional requirement of this nature must not, however, be overlooked, and an appropriate item has therefore been included in the statement of costs included in Appendix &quot; C.&quot;Air Staf, October 12, 1937.

APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;German Air Strength. 1. The growth of the German Air. Force has been traced in a number of papers placed before the Committee of Imperial Defence, from the time, even prior to the advent of the Nazi regime, when it first became evident that Germany was secretly evading the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. In October 1934, in Appendix II of C.I.D. Paper 1148-B, details were given of the strength and composition of the Air Force which Germany planned to build by October 1935. In C.I.D. Paper 1159-B, issued in November 1934, the story was carried a stage further, and it was possible to give particulars of the German plan for October 1936. These, however, were only forecasts, based upon secret information. While the preparations being made became increasingly obvious, it was not until March 1935 that Germany came into^the open and publicly announced the formation of the first units of the new German Air Force. At the same time, in conversation with Sir John Simon, Herr Hitler announced that Germany had already achieved parity with Great Britain. This statement was so impossible of belief that the Air Attache, Berlin, raised the question with General Milch, who confirmed it, and added that they intended to reach parity with France at a figure of 2,000 possibly in the same year.   This statement, however, was not believed.2. The veil of secrecy which had surrounded the embryo air force was now partly withdrawn, and the Air Attache,. JBerlin, was afforded facilities to visit a number of units. From his reports, coupled with information from other sources, a close record was kept of the growth of the German Air Force, and when, in September 1936, the German Government gave in confidence particulars of all units (88 squadrons) formed up to that date they were found to agree almost exactly with the estimate formed by the Air Staff. Thev demonstrated, moreover, that the 1935 and 1936 Plans described in C.I.D. Papers 1148-B and 1159-B respectively, which had come into the possession of the Air Staff two years before, had been authentic. The position by October 1936, then, was that the 1936 Plan had been completed to programme, entailing the formation of 93 squadrons (excluding Naval Co-operation Units), and that the Air Staff had been able to keep in close touch with the expansion as it occurred, a fact which encouraged them to believe that the future growth of the German Air Force could be followed with equal accuracy.3. The question now arose as to the final aim of the German Government in regard to the size of the Air Force. General Milch had stated that they intended to reach parity with France at a first-line strength of 2,000, but that statement formed part of a conversation in which many impossible claims had been put forward, and no reliance could be placed on it; moreover, since that statement had been made the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet Pact had altered the political outlook considerably, especially in the eyes of Germany. While no specific statement was made by any responsible authority, the German Air Attache in London frequently said that the Russian menace was an important factor in determining Germany&apos;s air expansion, and a number of public and private pronouncements by German officers and politicians conveyed the same idea. The German Air Ministry estimated the Russian first-line strength to be 4,500 aircraft, and the obvious conclusion to be drawn was that Germany was aiming at .a figure of the same order.4. In January 1937, General Milch informed the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in confidence that Germany intended to build up an Air Force of 180 squadrons (excluding coastal units) to be completed by the autumn of 1938. This was equivalent to only 1,620 first-line aircraft, and was therefore a surprisingly modest aim. General Milch, however, qualified his statement by adding that the German plan might of course be accelerated or expanded further if the political situation so required.5. In April 1937 information came into the possession of the Air Staff regarding the operational units to be formed in that year. It was assumed that, as in previous years, this programme would be completed by the 1st October 1937. This in fact has proved to be the case, and of the 180 squadrons which should be in existence on the completion of this programme, 174 have already been located or identified. It may safely be stated the German first-line strength on the 1st October, 1937, will be 180 squadrons (excluding coastal units) or 1,620 aircraft, of which at least 750 are long-range bombers.
6. That Germany intends to continue her expansion beyond this point can hardly be doubted, the evidence for it being overwhelming.   .(i) The normal operational unit of the German Air Force is the &apos;&apos; Gruppe &apos;&apos; of 3 squadrons; bomber and fighter units are organised in &apos;&apos; Geschwader &apos;&apos; of 3 and 2 Gruppen respectively. Many of the Geschwader formed under the present programme are as yet incomplete, and it is evident that further Gruppen must be formed to bring them to full strength.(ii) The Director of Training in the German Air Ministry stated in January 1937 that the output of trained pilots was then 1,500 per year. Since pilots serve for a period of 12 years, this output is greatly in excess of the needs of the German Air Force at its present strength.(iii) A large number of known Air Force aerodromes are still unoccupied, and many are in the earliest stages of construction. These are sufficient for at least one further annual programme of the same size as that for 1937, viz., about 85-90 squadrons, and there is every reason to suppose that more will become known to the Air Staff in the course of the next twelve months.(iv) The German aircraft industry, which has increased enormously in the past few years in order to cope with the demands of the growing Air Force, has now reached a point where its output is more than adequate to allow for the present rate of expansion and far greater than is required merely to maintain a force of the existing strength. Moreover, the expansion of the industry itself continues, there being a number of new factories still under construction.7. Assuming then, that the German Air Force will continue to expand at its present rate for some time to come, it remains to determine where the process will stop. An upper limit for her ultimate strength can probably safely be put at 4,500 first-line aircraft, her own published estimate of the Russian strength. The Air Staff believe this estimate to be exaggerated, and it is probable that the true estimate held by the German Air Staff is lower; it is not considered likely that the final German strength will reach this figure.8. The figure of 1,500 regular pilots trained annually will serve as a basis for a rough computation. 1,500 pilots annually serving for 12 years implies a total strength of 18,000 pilots; allowing a generous wastage figure of 33 per cent, over this period reduces the total to 12,000; and of these 1^ years&apos; output or 2,200 will be in training establishments, leaving a total of 9,800 in operational units. In the Royal Air Force there are rather more than 2-5 pilots to every aircraft of the first-line strength; if the same proportion applies to the German Air Force, its first-line strength should be of the order of 3,500.9. Germany is probably aiming, then, at an ultimate first-line strength of something between 3,000 and 4,000 aircraft. Two further annual programmes of 90 squadrons will bring her up to 360 squadrons or 3,240 aircraft, and this is the figure which the Air Staff believe to represent her final aim. The Air Staff are in possession of a document which purports to convey the actual German plan, in which the strength and composition of the Air Force is laid out in detail, together with the statement that it is hoped to complete this plan by the end of 1939. Three such plans which have come into the possession of the Air Staff in the past have proved to be genuine and i^eliable, and it is believed that the present one, which bears all the marks of authenticity, is. equally trustworthy.10. Accordingly, the Air Staff estimate of German air strength at the end of 1939, based upon this plan, and supported by all other considerations, is asfollows : Squadrons. A ircra ft.Bombers............ 162 1,458Dive bombers     ...       ...       ... 54 486Fighters ...      ......      ... 108 972Long Reconnaissance ...      ... 18 162Short Reconnaissance (A.C.)  ... 18 162Total.........        360 3,240To this must be added a relatively small number of Coastal units for Naval Co-operation and coast defence. These are the figures which were given as an Appendix to the Paper D.P. (P) 7 in July 1937.A ir Staff&apos;, October 8r 1937.[16017]

This scheme comprised the creation of four new aircraft &quot; sectors,&quot; making a total of fifteen, and the manning of all sectors by three squadrons of fighter aircraft each. The Report, however, assumed that the scale of attack to be met, would be that which could be developed by a German air striking force in the neighbourhood of 1,700 bombers, and although it drew attention to the need for concurrent increases in our own offensive air strength, no definite recommendations were formulated on that score.In view of the fact that the new proposals now put forward are based on a German strength of 1,458 bombers as opposed to one of 1,700, and that they include an increase in our own air striking force by 462 over and above the bomber strength to be provided under Scheme &quot; F,&quot; it is considered that the full number of fighter squadrons envisaged under the &quot; Ideal &quot; scheme cannot now be claimed to represent the minimum requirement for close defence. The additional 8 fighter squadrons which are now asked for would, in fact, permit the creation of the four new sectors which, owing to the increasing ranges of bomber aircraft, are essential for the defence of certain important and vulnerable areas in the North and West, and would also permit a substantial strengthening of the four most important sectors in the vicinity of London. These proposals, though they fall short of the &quot; Ideal &quot; system recommended by the Home Defence Committee, would, if supported by adequate ground A.A. defences, provide a strong deterrent, and a very formidable defensive system.f Includes 2 Coast Defence Squadrons, which, under Scheme &quot;F,&quot; were classified as Torpedo-Bombers, and were counted as part of the total bomber strength.

4fcAPPENDIX &quot; CFinancial Note.1. The aggregate net total of Air Estimates for the financial years 1938 to 1943 inclusive, on the basis of the present approved scheme (Scheme F) for the expansion of the Royal Air Force, but taking no account of the effect of the Defence Loans Act, has already been estimated at approximately  550 millions, and the annual recurrent total when stabilisation is reached, after 1943, at about  80 millions. The corresponding totals for Scheme H were roughly estimated at  640 millions and  90 millions respectively. These estimates were framed on certain assumptions, the chief of which are set out below.2. On the same basis, if the scheme now outlined (Scheme J) were approved, the corresponding aggregate figure for the same period might be very roughly fore-cast as of the order of  820 millions. The annual recurrent total on a stabilised basis would be of the order of  110 millions.3. The more important of the assumptions referred to above are as follows : (a) Re-equipment, after expansion is completed, based on a five-year period.(b) Overseas squadrons equipped, so far as types permit, from aircraftdisplaced from the Metropolitan Air Force.(c) No very marked rise in wage rates, and no increase in present pay of royal Air Force, but a further small increase in cost of materials.(d) No provision for any A.D.R. schemes not already financially authorised.(e) No provision for equipment and personnel of the Fleet Air Arm.(/) Provision of bomb reserves under Scheme F is made for six months&apos; War requirements, one half of which consists of filled bombs, and the other half of all components ready for filling. Under Scheme J provision is made on the same basis, except that the bulk of the overseas requirements will be filled. It is, however, considered that if the whole reserve is not held ready filled, provision must be made for filling the unfilled part immediately on the outbreak of war. This will necessitate the erection of further factories (which will in any case be needed in the event of war) estimated to cost about  20 millions to construct and  4 millions a year to maintain, and provision accordingly has been made in the Scheme J forecast.(g) Under Scheme J all headquarters and operational units are assumed to be maintained in peace time on a war establishment footing, in instant readiness for war.
