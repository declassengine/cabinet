TIGS BOCUMEHT IB TEE PROPERTY OP PUS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.REGULATION OF WAGES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT El THE TRANSPORT OF GOODS BY ROAD. Memorandum by the Minister of Labour. 1*     Carriers of good? by road are divxded into three classes -(l) Public Carriers, under A licences, who carry goods for hire or reward;(2) Limited Carriers, under B licences, who, whilst carrying their own goods, also carry goods for hire or reward;   and(3) Private Carriers, under C licences, who do not carry goods for hire or reward.2.     Since 1933, every A and B licence holder has been required under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, as a condition of his licence to observe the requirement of the Fair Wages Resolution, but no such condition has been imposed on C licence holders.     A voluntary National Joint Conciliation Board for the industry was established, but the exclusion of C licensees from the purview of the Board, the lack of organisation in the industry, and the statutory provision regarding &quot;fair wages&quot;, which in practice proved almost unworkable, created serious difficulties and made it impossible for the Board to provide a stable basis of wages and working conditions in the industry and for effective force to be given to its decisions.     In consequence of this very unsatisfactory position, I appointed, in conjunction with the Minister of Transport, the Baillie Committee in July, 1936, with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To examine the present position in regard to the regulationSECRETC.P.293(37)CABINET.of wages and conditions of service of persons employed in connection with the carriage of goods by road (whether in vehicles authorised under A, B or C licences) and to make recommendations as to the action which it is desirable totake&quot;.
5.     After taking evidence from all the interests concerned in the transport of goods by road the Committee came to a number of unanimous recommendations which are contained in their Report dated 24th April, 1937. These recommendations are set out in the Appendix.     Briefly the Committee recommends the setting up of new machinery for the regulation of wages and conditions of service of drivers and attendants of vehicles in the road motor transport industry (goods), the recommendations falling under two main heads, (l) those relating to A or B licences, and (2) those relating to C licences.4.     In regard to A and B licence holders, it is recommended that a Central Board with Area Boards should be set up, the Central Board being empowered to recommend, after consultation with the Area Boards, standard wages and conditions for confirmation and statutory enforcement by the Minister.     It is proposed that the Central Board should include representatives of national organisations and of each Traffic area, together with a Chairman and two other independent members appointed by the Minister.     For a breach of the statutory requirements Courts of Summary Jurisdiction should be empowered to impose a fine and order the payment of arrears of wages, and where the breach is persistent or wilful, the Licensing Authority should have power to suspend or revoke the licence.5.     In regard to C licence holders, it is recommended that drivers and attendants should be divided into two classes:    (l) those engaged in certain sections of retail distribution, and (2) all others.     For the first class, unless the present negotiations in the retail distributive trades result in an adequate system of wage regulation, a Trade Board or Trade Boards should be established.     As regards the second class, it should be required as a condition of the licence that all drivers and attendants should be paid &quot;fair and proper&quot; wages, such wages being those prescribed for A and B licensees or those determined by joint agreements between employers and workpeople*     It should be open to any organisation or employers or
workpeople engaged in goods transport by road to challenge the payment of &quot;fair and proper&quot; wages and bring the matter before an      appropriate industrial tribunal which should determine whether the waged are &quot;fair and proper&quot; and if not, fix the appropriate wages.     For a persistent or wilful breach of the requirement to pay &quot;fair and proper&quot; wages, the Licensing Authority should have pov^er to suspend or revoke the licence. 6.     The recommendations as a whole have been well received by all the major organisations on both sides of the road liaulage industry and pressure is being exerted by them and by the Railway Companies to secure early legislation.     The favourable reception of the Report by the A and B licence holders has been largely influenced by the fact that it is proposed to bring C licence holders under control and their attitude to the recommendations in respect of A and B licensed vehicles would be considerably modified if it were suggested that C licensed vehicles should be omitted from the scheme.     It was the intention of the Government in 1955 that the payment of fair wages in the case of A and B licensees should be effectively enforced, and the recommendations of the Committee appeal- to secure this, although some modification of the detailed proposals may be required - for example, the method of appointment of the Central Board and the question of the extent of the powers to be given to the Area Boeords, a matter which has particular significance in the case of Scotland.     Subject to modifications on detailed points, I propose to accept the recommendations in respect of A and B licensed vehicles. 7.     The recommendations in respect of C licensed vehicles raise a number of difficult issues which seem likely to provoke a certain amount of criticism.     There is opposition among those well-organised trades which have for many years possessed adequate negotiating machinery for the settlement of wages questions.     The determination of the wages of one small class of their employees by some tribunal not connected with the industry and to which they may be forced to go by some organisation outside their
negotiating machinery is regarded as a. menace to that machinery.     I have received representations to this effect from employers1 organisations in a number of industries and it is clear that these proposals will require modification.8.     In view of the difficulties which seem likely to arise in connection with any proposals for dealing with C licensed vehicles, I have considered the expediency of dealing only with k and B licensed vehicles, deferring the question of C licensed vehicles for further examinatjon.     This course would however meet with strong opposition in certain quarters, particularly from road hauliers and the railway companies who would complain that they were being exposed&apos;to unfair competition, particularly as C licence holders comprise the great majority of road operators.     There is no tiling in the licensing system to prevent a person from putting on -the road as many C vehicles for the carriage of his own goods as he wishes.     Wages form a very substantial pro-portion of the total operating costs of road transport, and the exemption of C licence holders from wages control, would by enabling them to pay their drivers less than professicnal hauliers, constitute an incentive to placing more and more C licensed vehicles on the road, to the detriment of road hauliers and the railways.     Peeling on this question is strong and as indicated above it is doubtful whether road haulierc would be prepared to accept statutory wage control without some measure of control for C licence holders as well.9.     The Salter Conference on Rail and Road Transport recommended, as a part of the licensing system, that C drivers&apos; wages should be regulated as well as A and B drivers&apos; and in the opinion of the Baillie Committee experience since 1933 has justified this recommendation.     The report which the Minister of Transport has recently received from the Transport Advisory Council, a body composed of representatives of all forms of transport and of traders, endorses this recommendation of the Baillie Committee and regards the settlement of the wages question as an essential preliminary to any further degree of co-ordination of transport.     To exclude C licence holders from any sort of control would seriously handicap any further development in this direction.
10,    For these reasons I propose to deal with C licence holders as well as A and B licence holders and to accept the general pi^inciple of the regulation of wages recommended by the Baillie Committee in respect of C licensed vehicles, but to make modifications in the detailed proposals in the light of the representations I have received.     I must not conceal from my colleagues that some of the points raised as regards C licences present great difficulties and before I can formulace definite proposals further consultation with the interests concerned is necessory;     but I hope that a compromise which will receive a sufficient amount of support can be reached. 11.   For the purpose of securing observance of prescribed wages and conditions, the Baillie Committee recommend the appointment of an adequate inspectorate, but make no recommendation as to its direction and control. Enforcement of the statutory requirements will be essential and I propose to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation and to adopt the most economical method for carrying it out by means of an extension of the existing Trade Boards Inspectorate.     Y/ith regard to administrative costs, sane provision will require to be made for fees for the independent members of the Central Board and for secretarial work.     It is estxmated that the cost of administration and enforcement will be in the neighbourhood of  25,000 a year. 12.    The Committee recommend that this expenditure should be borne by the licensees as a whole.     The cost of the present licensing scheme and of enforcing the existing regulation of fitness of vehicles, hours of driving,etc. is already charged against the receipts from licensing fees, so that no new principle is involved in the Committee&apos;s recommendation, -which, at the request of the Treasury, I propose to include in the Bill.     I anticipate criticism of this proposal however, particularly if it means an increase of the fees.     It will be argued that the motor industry is paying large sums in special taxation in the form of other licence fees and that no other industry is charged directly for services of the kind now proposed.13.    In accordance with the announcement made in the King&apos;s Speech, I propose to prepare immediately, in conjunction with the Minister of Transport, a Bill for the regulation of wages and conditions in the road motor transport industry (goods) on the lines indicated above.     My colleagues will have an
f 9.-0 x 6 3opportunity of considering the details of my proposals in the draft Bill which I intend to circulate.14.   Apart from the regulation of wages in the road haulage industry, voider aspects of the statutory regulation of wages are arising as a result of the expiration at the end of the year of Sections 1 and 2 of the Cotton Manufacturing Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1934, and the demands in a number of industries, notably the distributive trades, for some regulative machineiy with statutory backing or for the enforcement of voluntary agreements.     At the recent annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed welcoming the action of the Minister of Labour in inaugurating the discussions in the distributive trades.    - Similar dis-cussions have just commenced in the baking industry following the issue of the Alness Report on Night Baking, and other discussions will shortly be taking place in the catering trades, the rubber manufacturing industry and the cinema industry.     These discussions are very important and the line I think we ought to take - and I should be glad to know that my colleagues agree - is to say, if pressed to make a statement, that the Government will not delay taking such action as may be necessary, as a result of agreement between representative groups of employers and workpeople, for the establish-ment of appropriate machinery in these industries.(Intd.)   E.B.2nd December, 1957.
APPENDIX,Summary of Principal Recommendations of the Baillie Commit tee. A and 3 Licences.1.     The present provisions of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933 (whichextended to holders of A and B licences the wages requirements of the1930 Act for the observance of fair wages and conditions) are defective and should be drastically amended.2.     There should be set up new regulative machinery for the road motor transport industry (goods) in Great Britain to deal inter alia with all matters affecting the work, wages and conditions of drivers and statutory attendants.3.      Such machinery should consist of a Central Board arid local or Area Boards (corresponding to the Traffic Area) which should be set up simultaneously.4.      Ihe initiation o f all proposals for establishing or varying wages and conditions should rest solely with the Central Board, but any such proposals should be placed before the Area Boards for consideration and report before final decision is taken.    The Area Boards should have the right to recommend, to the Central Board, alterations or variations in such proposals so far as they affect their Area;    and the Central Board should be required to give their recommendation full consideration.    The final approval or rejection of such variations or alterations should however lie solely with the Central Board.5.      The Central Board should be empowered to reoommend to the appropriate Minister the standard wages and conditions, as finally determined, for enforcement.    The Minister should be empowered, by Order, to confirm the recommendations of the Central Board, and thus give them statutory effect. 6.      The Central and Area Boards should be appointed by the Minister after consultation with organisations of employers and employed;   and on the Central Board there should be included representatives of (a) national organisations and (b) each Traffic Area.    There should also be added to the
Central Board three independent members, to be appointed by the Minister, with power to vote, one of whom should be Chairman of the Board.    These members should also have the right to attend meetings of Area Boards on such occasions as may appear desirable.7.     While B licensees should remain within the control of the Board, arrangements should be made, having regard to the special circumstances that are likely to arise, to ensure that full opportunity is given to them adequately to place their views before the Board, if necessary through a panel of assessors.8.     There is no reason for continuing separate machinery for Scotland; and the machinery outlined above should be extended to cover Scotland. 9.     Drivers and statutory attendants employed by the Railway Companies and falling within the purview of the Machinery of Negotiation for Railway Staff should be excluded from the new machinery.10.    It should be made a condition of every A and B licence that the wages and conditions confirmed by Order of the Minister should be duly observed; and, further, such wages and conditions should be made implied terms of the contract of service of every driver and statutory attendant. 11.    Power should be given to the enforcing authority to deal with non-observance of the Order by proceedings before Courts of Summary Jurisdiction or otherwise.12.    To ensure that the workers themselves are fully informed as to the wages to which they are entitled, there should be affixed in a conspicious place, in every garage, a copy of the Order, in a form to be prescribed by the Minister.    The Traffic Examiners might be called upon to see that this requirement is duly observed.    It should also be required that an adequate record of wages paid shall be kept.13.    Courts of Summary Jurisdiction should be empowered, on conviction, both to impose a fine and to order the payment of arrears of wages.14.   Where it is established that an employer has been in breach Df thestatutory requirements, the Licensing Authority should have power to suspendor revoke the licence, if in his opinion the &quot;breach has been persistent orwilful.
C. Licences.15.    C licensees should not be subject to the above machinery but shouldbe dealt with on a separate basis.    Their drivers and statutory attendantsshould be divided into tv,ro classes;    (i) those engaged in certain sectionsof retail distribution (other than those employed by firms whose transport in organised as a distinct and separate branch or department of a business),and (ii) other 0 licence drivers and statutory attendants^16.    For the first class, unless the negotiations at present in progressin regard to wages and conditions in the retail distributive trades resultSTin an adequate system of regulation, a Trade Board -erf Trade Boards should be established to embrace inter alia, this class of driver. 17.   As regards the second class, it should be required as a condition of the licence that all drivers and statutory attendants should be paid fair and proper wages and that the conditions under which they work should be fair conditions.18..   For this purpose a C licence holder should be deemed to pay &quot;fair and proper&quot;wages if he observes the wages and conditions determined in one or other of the following ways : --(a) wages and conditions determined by the Central Board for A and B licensees;(b) wages and conditions determined by joint machinery for regulating wages and conditions, either for an industry as a whole or for a defined part of an industry, whether such machinery takes the form of a Joint Industrial Council, Trade Board, or other similar body which provides such machinery for fixing wages for employees driving motor vehicles;(o) wages and conditions determined by other agreements applicable to individual firms or particular trades or district, which have been settled by an employer or employers with accredited representatives of a bona fide trade union embracing transport workers.
19.     V/here questions arise as to whether the wages paid are fair and proper or not, it should be open to any organisation of employers or employees engaged in the transport of goods to make representation to the enforcing authority;    and that authority, if the cases are contested, &quot;should forthwith refer them to the Industrial Court or other appropriate tribunal which should, after talcing all the circumstances into consideration, determine whether the wages paid are fair and proper or not, and if not so, should fix the appropriate wages and conditions.20.     Sates of wages and conditions deemed to be fair in accordance with the above procedure should be made known to those employed in the industry in such manner as may be prescribed;    and rates of wages and conditions determined by the tribunal should be published in the Ministry of Labour Gazette. 21.     Yihere it is established that an employer has been in breach of the statutory requirements, the Licensing Authority should have power to suspend or revoke the licence, if in his opinion the breach has been persistent or wilful. General.22.     There should be appointed an adequate inspectorate to assist in securing observance of prescribed conditions.      Inspectors should be empowered to make full investigations and have access to all wage records;    and, in the case of G licences, should decide - as to whether a prirna facie case has been made out for reference to the Industrial Court or other tribunal.23.      The cost of giving effect to the proposals should be charged against the receipts from licensing fees.H.Q,126-75 L.G.
