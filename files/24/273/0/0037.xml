9 ,i -document IS THh PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAIL&quot;IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVfrRNMENT.COPY NO.__3 8CABINEToSHARE-PUSHING.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Id    I ask for authority to have a Bill drafted to give general effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Archibald Bodkin, which was appointed by my predecessor to consider the operations commonly known as share-pushing and share-hawking and similar activities, and to submit the Bill in due course to the Home Affairs Committee in order that the Bill may be introduced as soon as possible after the Christmas Recess.    A Bill o.n this subject was included as urgent or essential in the Home Affairs Committee&apos;s survey of legislation for this session -which was approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 36(37), Conclusion 11).    The Report of the Bodkin Committee was published as Cmd.  5539.2.    The subject has aroused strong public feeling in recent years and there is a general demand for action to repress these activities.    They comprise not only offers of worthless shares in exchange for cash or valuable securities but also invitations to the public to participate in fraudulent gambling transactions in stocks and shares and in finance and commodity pools, to purchase commodities or metals on the margin system and to take participations in property of one kind or another including mushroom farms and the like.    A prominent feature if the share-pusher&apos;s method is that of making calls, in,312(37) .-1-
person or &quot;by telephone, on his intended victim.3o    It is true that the evil is in large measure attributable to the folly and ignorance of the persons who allow themselves to be. duped and that much can be achieved by prompt investigation of complaints by the police and prosecution of offenders.    Nevertheless, the task of the share-pusher is facilitated by the absence in this country of any requirement which must be fulfilled before a person is allowed to deal in stocks and shares.4.    Stocks and shares are dealt in not only by members of recognised stocks exchanges but also by a large number of so-called outside brokers or dealers, most of them persons of repute, as well as-by banks and finance houses. The Bodkin Committee had under consideration a suggestion that no one should be allowed to deal in stocks and shares unless he were a member either of a recognised stock exchange or of an approved association of outside dealers, but they expected that there would be difficulties in the way of the formation of an association which would either be sufficiently strong or sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all the different categories involved.    Since the date of the Report, considerable progress has, I understand, been made in the direction of the formation of an association of outside dealers, but there would still be a substantial number of reputable persons and undertakings (e.g. finance houses) who would remain outside such an association.5o   As regards stocks and shares, therefore, the broad lines of the proposed Bill would be as follows:-
(i) After a certain date it should he unlawful for any person to transact business in stosks and shares with any member of the public unless he is a person authorised to transact such business. Authorisation would be conferred by(a) membership of recognised stock exchanges,(b) membership of any association recognised for the purpose by the Board of Trade, and(c) registration by the Board of Trade as a dealer in stocks and shares.    The conditions of registration would be stringent and would include the furnishing of satisfactory references and sureties.(ii) The Board of Trade should have power to remove aperson from the Register in certain circumstances-e.g. if he has been convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, or if after due enquiry, he has been found guilty of dishonourable conduct in his business dealings.(iii) In order to prevent abuses with regard to personalcalls (see paragraph 2 above), it would be made illegal for any person, not being a person authorised under (i), to transact business in stocks and shares during any call made by him upon a member of the public,  to offer any shares for subscription, underwriting or purchase, or to negotiate the subscription, underwriting or purchase by such person of any shares; and the expression &quot;call&quot; would include any communication by telephone.
(iv) There would be provisions excluding from the scope of the Bill (a)  certain agency transactionss and (b)  the issue or sale of shares with a proper prospectus, etc in strict accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, 19 29.6.    Provisions on. these lines would carry out the main recommendations of the Bodkin Committee, the only important modification being with regard to personal calls on members of the general public.    The Committee recommended that only members of a recognised stock exchange or other association should    be allowed to transact share business during such calls, but I have proposed in paragraph 5(iii) above that that facility should also be extended to persons on the register.    The object of this departure is to avoid that interference with the day to day business of reputable concerns which I am assured would be caused if the Committee!s recommendations were strictly followed.    Further, the Committee&apos;s proposal is in itself discriminatory and, as constituting a privilege in favour of members of certain institutions, might be difficult to defend in Parliament.    The reason for the Committee&apos;s recommendation, I understand, was that they felt that the practices in question, while not objection-able in themselves, might become objectionable if done by objectionable people;    and they were prepared to allow them only in those cases in which the persons concerned were members of associations and subject to properly constituted disciplinary committees.    The proposed disciplinary powers of the Board of Trade in regard to persons on the register would, however, go far to meet this objection.
6 457.    I have heen in consultation with the members of the Bodkin Committee, with the Committee of the Stock Exchange and with other interests, and I have reason to believe that a Bill embodying provisions on the above lines would betgenerally acceptable.8.    I v/ould propose to follow the Bodkin Committee1 s recommendation that the general provisions relating to dealings in stocks and shares should be applied to the other activities to which reference is made in paragraph 2 above. The persons engaged in these activities would be required to register and, as in most cases they would not be able to comply with the requirements proposed by the Committee, they would be driven out of business to the general advantage. These provisions v/ould be so framed as also to cover invitations to participate in mushroom farms, soya bean cultivation, etc.9.    The Committee made a Jaumber of recommendations of minor importance which are under discussion with the different Departments concerned, and I would suggest that provisions might,  so far as necessary or practicable, bo embodied in the Bill to give effect to any of these recommendations subject to agreement with the respective Departments.10.    I would propose also that the. Bill should include a provision prohibiting bodies which are registered as industrial and provident societies from offering shares and debentures to the public.      Such bodies would in future be registered not under the Industrial and Provident   Societies -acts as at present, but under the Companies Act, 1929.     This would involve compliance with the prospectus and returns provisions of the latter Act and ensure publication of information as to the financial position of the company which is at present withheld.      It would thus meet the complaints which have been made as regards existing abuses.     I understand that the
Board of Trade.17th December, 1937.Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies has &quot;been in informal consultation v/ith Mr. A.V. Alexander on behalf of the Co-operative Movement and that Mr. Alexander concurs in the proposal.11.    The administration of the provisions of the proposed Bill will entail new expenditure &quot;by the Board of Trade for additional staff, but it is not likely that this expenditure will exceed some  2,000 per annum and it may be expected that the greater part of it will be met out of fees for registration.12.    My colleagues.es will realise that this is a complicated subject and that there is a danger of our interfering with normal and proper methods of business. I fear that only the actual drafting of a Bill will bring to light all the difficulties.    I should like,  therefore, to reserve the right to suggest alterations in these proposals if the draft reveals substantial difficulties.O.F.G. S.
