COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC INFORMATION.Composition and Terms of Reference.ON the 14th July, 1931, the Prime Minister appointed a standing committee of the Economic Advisory Council with the following terms of reference :- to supervise the preparation of periodical reports to the Economic Advisory Council on the economic situation, and to advise as to the continuous study of economic development.2.   The committee is constituted as follows :  Sir Josiah Stamp, G.C.B., G.B.E., Chairman.Mr. G. D. H. Cole. Mr. Ff. 1). Henderson. Mr. J. M. Keynes, C.B.* Sir Alfred Lewis, K.B.E. Mr. D. H. Robertson. Sir Arthur Salter, K.C.B., M.P. with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross,  G.C.M.G., K.C.B.,  Chief  Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Sir Frederick Phillips, K.C.M.G., C.B., Under-Secretary, Treasury. Mr. Francis Hemming, C.B.E., Secre-^* Owing to illness, Mr. J. M. Keynes was unable to attend any of the meetings of the Committee devoted to the preparation of this report.
TWENTY-THIRD REPORT.Survey of the economic situation, October 1937.BY our terms of reference we are directed to supervise the preparation of periodical reports on the economic situation; and in accordance with these instructions we now submit the twenty-third of these periodical reports. The report represents the general views of the committee, without attempting to express the different shades of opinion held by individual members.2. In part 1, we summarise the chief economic events of recent months. In part 2, we discuss the prospects of international trade and the bearing which the trend of prices and policy with regard to gold and the international financial system generally may have upon these.       -3. The urgency of the problems relating to gold which we discuss in the second part of our report, has been greatly diminished during its preparation by the recent decline in commodity prices and stock exchange values in New York and elsewhere. For the previous preoccupation with the inflationary tendencies inherent in the present value of gold has disappeared. Nevertheless, we believe that the problem is one which is bound to require further consideration, if there is to be a return to a system of international financial collaboration.(Signed on behalf of the committee) :J. C. STAMP, Chairman.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 17, 1937.
SURVEY OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, OCTOBER 1937.Part 1. Summary of recent economic events.(a) Finance.THE most noticeable feature of the exchange markets this year has been the continued depreciation of the franc. The franc was maintained at 105 to the pound, the level chosen after the September devaluation, for five months. Subse-quently a gradual further depreciation was allowed, and by the end of June the value of the franc had fallen nearly to the lower limit permissible under the law as it then stood, namely, at approximately 111 to the pound. After the political crisis at the end of June, legislation was introduced enabling the franc to vary indefinitely and in July and August the rate was somewhat over 130 to the pound. In September further heavy sales of francs occurred, and, in default of serious intervention on the part of the French exchange control, the rate was carried down to approximately 150 to the pound and it now stands a little above this level. The publication of statistics relating to French imports and exports of gold appears to have been discontinued, but the British returns show that 16 million ounces of gold were received from France in this country in the first eight months of the year and further amounts were probably exported, e.g., to the Netherlands. Some part of this gold export may have been required to finance an adverse balance of payments, for the excess of French imports over exports of merchandise in the first eight months was greater than last year by an amount equivalent to the value of about 3,7 million ounces of gold. But it is probable that much of this deficiency has been made good by the increased gold value of other receipts, and it is clear the export of French capital has continued on a very substantial scale throughout the year. As usual, one of the effects of this export of capital has been to increase slightly the value of the pound in relation to the dollar, the rate during August being 1^ per cent, higher than at the end of 1936, though still rather lower than a year before.Table 1.Average of the mean London daily rates of exchange from October 1935 to september 1937.

2. The exports of gold from France added considerably to the amounts of gold offered for sale in London and New York. In addition, the supplies of gold in the market were swollen by considerable exports from Russia and from Japan. At the same time a large part of the gold previously held in private hoards was also thrown upon the market, largely as a consequence of rumours to the effect that the United States buying price for gold might be reduced. As a consequence the buyers on whom the market depended, namely, the American Treasury, the British Exchange Equalisation Fund, and the Dutch authorities, were called on to take up very large quantities of gold. It is impossible to estimate the total amount involved at all accurately, but it may have reached as much as 65 million ounces in the first eight months of the year. Gold exports to the United States had previously been financed for the most part by the purchase of American stock exchange securities by British and continental investors, and in the first quarter of the year such purchases continued to be made on a substantial scale. But after the British stock exchange began to show signs of weakness in the spring, these purchases seem to have fallen off very considerably. Nevertheless, a large part of the proceeds of the sale of gold were held in London, with the result that the spot rate for sterling appreciated in relation to the forward rate to a point at which it proved profitable to move banking funds to New York and Amsterdam. In this way finance was provided for the sales of gold and, possibly in the case of Amsterdam, of securities to these centres. In September the premium on forward dollars and guilders has fallen, probably because the selling of securities in New York and Amsterdam has led to further British buying.Table 2.The price of gold in London and New York since January 1936 and 1937, and the interest to be earned on English banking funds deposited in New York and A msterdam through forward exchange dealings since January 1937.Month.Average market price for gold in London per fine ounce.1936.1937.New York price of gold (35 dollars per fine ounce) as a percentage of the London price.1936.1937.Interest rate per annum to be earned by depositing banking funds and covering in the forward exchangein the year 1937.On funds   On funds deposited   deposited in        in Amster-New York.      dam.JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember140 10-8 140 10-9 140 11-8140 9&apos; 140 1&apos; 138 8&apos; 138 10&apos; 138   4137 11-9 141 11-0 142 3-2 141   8-3141 142 142 141 140 140 140 139 140d. 8-41-3 4-3 3-6 7-9 6-7 0-3 8-4 4-4100-25 99-10 99-87 100-55 100-53 100-55 100-35 100-65 100-65 100-74 100-74 100-63100-68 100-68 100-70 100-76 100-78 100-95 100-68 100-55 100-7654 56 65 89 18 06 13 15 85 63*-03 -32 -58 -04 -37 -22 -06 -14 -81 -65** Three weeks.3. Net imports of gold into Great Britain in the first eight months of the year amounted to 11-8 million ounces, valued at  80-6 millions. Gross imports amounted to 35 - 0 million ounces, of which Empire producing countries sent about 9-3 million ounces, France 16-4 million ounces, Soviet Russia, a new source of
gold, 5 -1 million ounces, India and the Far East 2 million ounces, and Germany 1 million ounces. Of exports amounting to 23-2 million ounces, 21-1 million ounces went to the United States. From the suspension of the gold standard in September 1931 till the end of August 1937 net imports of gold into Great Britain amounted to 111 -1 million ounces, and the gold holding of the Bank in September 1931 was 31 - 7 million ounces. Thus the amount of gold in Great Britain at the end of August 1937 (excluding industrial gold) was approximately 143 million ounces. The corresponding figure at the end of March 1937 was 136 million ounces. At that time the gold holding of the Bank and the Exchange equalisation account were reported to be approximately 100 million ounces, leaving 36 million ounces for the amount of gold held in Great Britain by the monetary authorities of other countries and by private hoarders. The Federal Reserve Bulletin for August 1937 asserts that in the second quarter of the year there were substantial sales of gold in private account, which may have reduced the amount of gold hoarded in London. At the end of June the resources of the British Exchange equalisation account were increased by a further  200 millions, bringing the total resources which have been put at the disposal of the account to  575 millions. The reported gold holdings of the principal central banks and treasuries are given in the following table : Table 3.Approximate Gold holdings of the 5 principal central banks and theU.S. Treasury.(In millions of fine ounces.)End of the month of 	Bank of England.

But the effect of this increase in the credit situation was conditioned by a number of circumstances. In the first place, the gold withdrawn from the Bank of France in the period was consistently replaced by an extension of credit by the Bank of France to the French Government, and consequently has not affected the credit situation in that country.   Thus the gold available for monetary use has been
effectively increased by these withdrawals. At the same time not all of the gold coming into the possession of other banks has been allowed to have its full effect on the credit situation. The gold in the Bank of England, and since September 1936 in the Netherlands Bank, is valued below its market price; the British fiduciary issue was reduced by  60 millions in December 1936; and since December 1936 the gold received by the United States Treasury has been sterilised in the &quot; Inactive Account.&quot; The net effect of these different factors has been as follows: Table 4.Gold in 5 central banks and the U.S. Treasury.(In millions of ounces.)

Treasury bill rates in the first half of the financial year remained very near the minimum of one-half of 1 per cent, established by agreement among the joint-stock banks. In June, as is normal, rates rose in anticipation of the demand for cash over the end of the half-year, but even in that month the increase in rates was moderate. From the beginning of the financial year till the 30th September the total issue of Treasury bills rose from  675 millions to  899 millions. The principal reason for this increase was a further issue of Treasury bills to the amount of  200 millions to the Exchange equalisation account. The balance was accounted for by a reduction of  15 millions in the -ways and means advances by Public Departments. The net borrowing required to meet the usual excess of budgetary expenditure over receipts in the first half of the year amounted to  98 millions. But this was financed by an issue of  100 millions of 2\ per cent. National Defence Bonds. This issue was, in the first instance, largely taken up by Public Departments, but subsequently a large proportion of the issue appears to have been placed in the market. The issue of Treasury bills to the market increased steadily from  497 millions at the beginning of the financial year to  573 millions at the end of August, at which figure it has remained throughout September. The changes in the amount of the issue reflect, on the one hand, the sales of National Defence Bonds by Public Departments to the public, and, on the other, the growth of the net borrowing in respect of the current budget, and purchases of gold by the Exchange equalisation account, in so far as these were not financed by the sale of gold to the Bank of England, which increased its gold holding by nearly  13 millions in the period.6. Bank deposits in August were  37 millions higher than a year before, but  32 millions lower than in December 1936. Bank deposits are subject to fairly marked seasonal movements.   They are at their highest in December and
January. They fall in February and March. They rise again from March to July; then fall till September; and rise again in the last three months of the year. This year, apart from these seasonal movements, there seems to have been no upward trend in deposits since March, or perhaps even earlier. Thus the increase in deposits which has persisted since the end of the third quarter of 1934 seems to have come to an end after continuing for 2% years, in the course of which deposits have expanded by about 18 per cent. On the asset side, there was a decrease between August 1936 and August 1937 of  68 millions in the banks&apos; holding of discounted bills, and an increase of  96 millions in their advances to customers; the other items in their balance sheets show only small changes over the twelve months.Table 5.London clearing banks&apos; average weekly balances.

Allowance must also be made in the case both of the British and the American figures for deposits for the fact that throughout this year there has been a tendency for non-residents to acquire deposits in these countries through the sale of gold.8. The change in credit conditions indicated by the figures in the two preceding tables reacted on the prices of those securities and commodities which are affected by speculative activity. In the following table are given indices of the prices of ordinary shares and common stock in Great Britain and the United States, and of primary commodities in both centres. It will be seen that British ordinary shares reached their highest point at the end of 1936, and that the other three indices reached their highest points in March 1937. Since that time there has been a more or less continuous fall in all the indices.Deposits in banks in the United States.

The decline in the prices of certain classes of ordinary shares may also have been assisted by the rise of long-term interest rates which followed the announcement of the Governments intention to expend money on rearmament on a scale which would involve substantial borrowing. There has also been some rise in long-term interest rates in the United States, partly as a consequence of the need for substantial borrowing in order to carry into effect the policy of sterilising gold imports in the &quot;inactive gold fund,&quot; and partly for technical reasons connected with the increase in the required reserves of member banks and the transference of funds into the interior.Table 8.Long-term interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States.Average for the year-1934      ... *    ..1935      .....1936      .....June DecemberUnited KingdomYield on 2* per cent, consols.310 2-89 2-942-94 2-96United States.

The wholesale prices of commodities, as measured by the more inclusive indices, naturally do not show quite as violent movements as the indices of the prices of primary commodities given in table 7 above. But they also show a strong upward tendency beginning in the middle of 1936, and a more recent tendency for the level of prices to become stabilised or even to decline. In the case of French prices, however, which have been influenced by the depreciation of the franc, the rise is still continuing. German prices have not fully reflected the rise which has occurred in world prices, although the shortage in the available supplies of the commodities included in the index is probably very pronounced.Table 9.Wholesale commodity prices.Great Britain.

The figures for dates subsequent to July 1936 are subject to revision in the light of the results of the count of insured.persons taken in July 1937. The effect of this revision will be to increase the estimate of insured persons in employment in recent months by a substantial figure. In September 1937 the Ministry of Labour adopted a new basis for estimating the number unemployed.   The figures given are those which would have been yielded on the old basis.The expansion of employment and the reduction of unemployment in the course of the current year has been well sustained. Considered industrially the most striking improvement in the unemployment situation has occurred in the group of industries producing semi-finished goods destined for the most part for use in the satisfaction of the current demands of individual consumers, rather than for the production of investment goods.  This group includes coal mining and the textile
industries, and is much affected by fluctuation in export demand. Taking the group as a whole, unemployment has declined from about 15^ per cent, in August 1936 to about 11 per cent, in August 1937, and this compares with the group&apos;s unemployment of 14 per cent, in August 1929. Having regard to the fact that the group in question includes many of the industries in which a surplus of unemployed labour at one time seemed likely to afford a particularly intractable problem, this is a very satisfactory feature of the present situation. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that these industries, because they are strongly affected by short-period changes in the quantity of stocks held by wholesalers and in transit are normally given to substantial and even regular short-term fluctuations in their degree of activity, and it is not impossible that there may be some reaction from their present activity&apos;in the next few months. In any event activity in the coal mining industry is now so satisfactory that the full normal seasonal improve-ment between summer and winter months may not occur in that industry. In that event the normal decline in activity in the building industry may have a greater effect upon the total of unemployment than is usually the case. We mention these possibilities because it is quite possible that the unemployment figures for the next few months may present a rather less favourable picture than was the case this summer, and, in view of the decline which has recently occurred in stock exchange values, exaggerated importance may be attributed to this change.12. The Board of Trade&apos;s index of industrial production for the second quarter of 1937 stood at 134-7 per cent, of the average for the year 1930, and was 2-3 per cent, greater than in the first quarter, and 9-1 per cent, greater than in the second quarter of 1936. Every component of the index, excepting &quot; Building materials and building &quot; and &quot; Leather and boots and shoes,&quot; showed a substantial expansion in comparison with the preyious year.13. In the following table figures are given of the building plans approved by local authorities.

The figures published for July and August show a reduction compared with the same two months a year ago at 16^ per cent, in the case of dwelling houses, and of 11^ per cent, in the case of other buildings. The figures given show a tendency to decline, much more pronounced in the case of dwelling houses than in the case of other buildings. If, however, account is taken of the considerable Government programme, it is by no means impossible that the amount of new building work being put in hand in the last few quarters has been greater than at any previous time. Moreover, the fact that delays are being experienced in the execution of work already under construction is sufficient in itself to explain a tendency on the part of private contractors to delay the submission of plans for new work, and this tendency has been reinforced by the increase in building costs which has occurred. Nevertheless, in certain southern districts the falling off in new plans passed has been much more considerable than in the country as a whole, and this evidence of some relaxation of building activity is confirmed by a slight increase in unemployment among insured workers in the building industry in London and the South-East.14. The domestic absorption of steel continues at a very high level; it averaged 921 thousand tons a month in the first eight months of 1937, and was 4^ per cent, higher than in the corresponding months of 1936. Exports, moreover, have expanded materially this year, and imports, in the first five months were materially smaller. In these circumstances production was expanded by 10J per cent, in the first eight months of the year. Even so, considerable difficulties have been experienced in securing adequate supplies.Table 13.Consumption of steel in the United Kingdom.(Thousands of tons.)	Production of steel.

Retail sales continue to expand. The increase in the value of sales remains greater in the case of foodstuffs than in the case of other goods, as the rising tendency of food prices is restricting to some extent expenditure in other directions. The increase in sales in the seven months since February this year, amounts to 8 per cent, over last year. The improvement is less marked in London than elsewhere.

The course of production in the United States has been rather irregular this year. The first quarter showed steady and satisfactory progress. In the second quarter production continued at the high level reached at the end of the first quarter, but was affected in June by strikes in the steel industry. In the first two months in the third quarter activity in the steel industry was again at a, high level, but there was some retrogression in the textile industries, which, in the previous months, had probably been benefiting from the building up of stocks against the possibility of a rise in prices. In September the steel industry also showed signs of suffering from the accumulation of stocks in the hands of consumers. The index of factory employment, which is less sensitive to short period fluctuations in activity, showed a steady, but not very rapid, improvement. Retail trade has not been expanding very fast, but has been by no means unsatisfactory.

An indication of the more recent changes in the level of American activity can be obtained from the movements of the New York Times index of business activity. This index suggests that after an improvement in August activity relapsed in September to a level appreciably below that prevailing in July.Table 16.New York Times index of business activity.

The course of bank deposits, security prices and commodity prices in the United States has been touched upon above. The current year has seen, in addition, important developments in the banking policy pursued in the United States. The objective of this policy appears to be the re-establishment of the use of the reserve banks&apos; rates for rediscounting bills as an instrument for the control of the volume of credit. The first step in this policy was to prevent the inflow of gold from increasing the reserves of member banks in a way which threatened to remove them altogether from the control of the reserve banks. This was effected last December, when the Treasury undertook the task of insulating the banking system from the effects of these imports by offsetting sales of Government securities. The next step was to reduce the volume of excess reserves in the possession of member banks by an increase in the legal reserve requirements under the powers vested in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system. This increase was carried out in two stages, the first of which came into effect in March and the second in May. As a consequence, excess reserves fell from over 2,000 million dollars in February to under 800 million18. The value of construction contracts awarded in the 37 Eastern States of the union has been materially higher so far this year than in the corresponding months of 1936. The total value of contracts awarded in the first eight months of the year is nearly 17 per cent, higher than in 1936. Contracts for residential buildings are 32 per cent, higher, those for &quot; other buildings&quot; 23 per cent, higher, but contracts for public works and utilities 3 per cent, lower. The total value of contracts awarded still remains far below the figure for 1928. Building costs have recently shown a rising tendency.
dollars in July. Moreover, the reduction of excess reserves among banks in the reserve cities, and in New York in particular, was accelerated by the movement of funds into the interior to finance the expansion of trade. As a consequence, the excess reserves of New York banks, which towards the end of 1935 had amounted to 1,500 million dollars, had fallen by August last to 40 million dollars. Finally, in August recourse by member banks to the reserve banks was encouraged by a reduction in the reserve banks&apos; rates of rediscount, the New York rate being reduced to 1 per cent, and the rate in most of the other districts to 1\ per cent. The final application of this policy was, however, checked by the unexpectedly severe decline in stock exchange security prices in September, which must have suggested that the deflationary effects of the policy being pursued were greater than had been anticipated. In September, therefore, there was a reversal of policy and the Treasury released 300 million dollars of gold from the inactive fund, with the result that excess reserves were increased by the same amount.(d) France.20. French industrial production appears to have received extraordinarily little benefit from the devaluation of the franc and the inflationary financial policy which has been pursued. The index of production, which had fallen to 95 per cent, of the 1913 average in September, rose fairly rapidly to 105 in April. From that time, however, a decline set in, and by July the index had fallen to 100, at which level it was lower than the best point reached in the previous year, namely, 102, reached in April and May 1936. At the same time the numbers employed in factories employing more than 100 persons increased steadily from 72 - 9 per cent, of the 1930 average in April 1936 to 80-7 per cent, in July 1937, and this increase in employment was reflected by a fall of over 100,000 in the numbers of unemployed persons receiving assistance. On the other hand, the &quot;index of activity&quot; among employed persons, which is a rough index of the 4&apos; man-hours &apos;&apos; worked in the factories covered by the index of employment, corrected for normal seasonal variations, showed only a small increase, from 70 -1 per cent, of the 1930 average in April 1936 to 71 - 0 in October 1936, and has since declined to 64-4 in July 1937. The movements of these different indices are hard to reconcile, but it seems clear that the expansion of production has been seriously obstructed by the reduction in the working week.Table 18.Employment and industrial production in France since September 1935.1 Month.

21. The industries where production is at the moment least satisfactory-are the textile industry and the building industry. In both cases there was a considerable improvement in activity after the devaluation, and in the case of the textile industries the index of production in November and December was better than at any time since the short-lived improvement in French activity in the later months of 1933 and the earlier months of 1934. Subsequently, however, there has been a sharp reaction, and the building index has fallen to the lowest point since the industry began to revive after the war. The position of the other main industries dependent on investment demand is more satisfactory thanks to the heavy requirements of the French Government for armaments.22. Financially, the French situation has continued to be dominated by the budget position and the weakness of the exchange. These factors in the situation are, of course, interlocked and it is only because the unbalanced condition of the budget forces the State to expand credit continually that it is impossible to check the outflow of capital by ordinary operations on the volume of credit. Nevertheless, the French authorities, impressed by the restrictive effects on enterprise of the high rates of interest now prevailing have attempted to maintain long-term interest rates on Government securities below their equilibrium point, e.g., by the setting up of a fund to support the rentes market out of the profits from revaluing the gold stock in July. It is doubtful whether measures such as these can have much effect on the industrial situation, for even the present rates of interest are prohibitive; but they add to the difficulties of maintaining the exchange by increasing the liquid funds which can be transferred abroad. In present circumstances a revival of activity in the investment industries is much more likely to occur as was the case in 1926 through a flight into &quot; real values &quot; than through a reduction in interest rates. One factor which may alleviate the financial position in France is the growth of the note circulation which the rising tendency of French prices and wages is already causing.
(e) Germany.23. The general aspect of the economic life of Germany shows little change. Production and employment continue to expand under the pressure of a strong demand supported by immense expenditure by the State, and abundant liquid resources in the hands of banks and industrial concerns. The improvement, however, is still not reflected in a proportionate improvement in consumption, partly because of a diversion of productive resources to the investment industries and to the industries producing raw materials which were at one time imported, and partly because the resources devoted to the production of consumers&apos; goods are not fully employed, as a result of the deficient and intermittent supply of raw materials. Another factor making for lower consumption has been the restrictions imposed on the level of wages. These results are illustrated by the indices of employment and hours worked reproduced below : Production goods industries.Index of employment(1936 = 100) Hours worked per day Index of total hours workedConsumption goods industries.Index of employment(1936 = 100) Hours worked per day Index of total hours workedSecond quarter 1929. 1937.95-6 109-67-72 7-8195 0 1130(Increase 19 per cent.)111-2 106-77-61 7-48117-0 108-6(Decrease 7 per cent.)The figures suggest, moreover, a deterioration in the situation in the summer of this year, which may have been caused by the sharp increase in the international prices of raw materials in the spring, and by the need which has been experienced of importing considerable quantities of food-stuffs, owing to the deficiency of the 1936 harvest.  It is to be feared that the 1937 harvest will also be unsatisfactory.24. The continuing deficiency of raw materials has led to increasingly drastic steps to mobilise the foreign exchange resources of German nationals. Long-term securities saleable on foreign markets must now be reported to the Reichsbank, as well as holdings of foreign exchange. Moreover, the German Government is taking measures to effect the transfer of these securities into its own hands.25. The internal financial problems of the German Government cause less -anxiety. Its indebtedness is growing at a substantial rate, but it is now being-financed by the issue of medium-term securities, generally at a slight discount, bearing interest at 4-g per cent. It has been found that the capacity of the market to absorb these issues is reflected by the increase in the circulation of the &apos;&apos; Sola &apos;&apos; bills of the gold discount Bank. When this circulation reaches 1,000 million reichsmarks a new issue is made and the excessive liquidity of the money market is reduced. The financial position of the German Government has also been improved by a substantial increase in ordinary revenue, which this year should amount to 14,000 million reichsmarks, double the sum received in the year 1932-33. The principal indices of German economic activity are reproduced in table 19.

(f) International Trade.26. The League of Nations indices of the volume and value of world trade are given in the following table. The quantum of world trade showed a sharp expansion in the first two quarters of 1937, and in the second quarter the League of Nations index was only 1 per cent, below the figure for the corresponding quarter of 1929. This sudden increase in the volume of world trade was undoubtedly connected with the great activity prevailing in commodity markets early in the year. There has subsequently been some decline in this activity, and indices reflecting this activity, e.g., those of commodity prices and the receipts of &quot; Cables and Wireless &quot; have fallen. It may, therefore, happen that the increase will not be fully maintained in the remainder of the year.Table 20.International Trade.

British exports have shown a very considerable expansion this year, and it is plain that the increase in the purchasing power of our customers brought about by our heavy imports in 1936 is now affecting their demand for our exports. In the first nine months of the year British exports amounted to  386 millions, an increase of  66 millions over 1936, re-exports to  59 millions, an increase of  14 millions and imports to  742 millions, an increase of  134 millions. The increase in the visible adverse balance of trade, which at  297 millions is  55 millions greater than last year, is substantial, especially when account is taken of the fact that last year&apos;s trading resulted in a deficit on the balance of payments which amounted, according to the Board of Trade&apos;s estimate, to nearly  20 millions. But other elements in the balance of payments will again show a very considerable expansion this year. Shipping freights, for example, were in September nearly 70 per cent, higher than a year before, and the volume of trade carried has also increased. Moreover our receipts from investments will again be substantially larger. One of the noticeable features of this year&apos;s trade returns is that whereas the increase in the value of imports is mostly accounted for by an increase in price, the increase in exports is mostly due to an increase in volume.

Part 2. International trade, the price level and the gold problem.30. We propose in this report to consider three closely related questions, namely, the future of international trade, the trend of prices, and the influence on both of these of the international monetary system, and, in particular, of the place which gold plays in this. It is common ground in discussions of the present position of international trade that the restrictions and regulations which impede it are a threat not only to economic progress, but also to the maintenance of peace. The deterioration in the conditions under which international trade is conducted arose because each separate step in the process offered relief from some particular difficulty with which a particular nation was faced in the course of the depression. If every nation could agree to relax simultaneously the restrictions which it now enforces, most of them might expect compensation in other spheres, and the prospects of international trade would be greatly improved. But there is little reason to anticipate such agreement, and the object of policy must rather be to create conditions under which the self-interest of each nation suggests a course which favours the growth of international trade. These conditions, however, can hardly be created without adopting expedients to which some disadvantages attach, at any rate for a time.31. The principal causes which led to the growth of restrictions on inter-national trade were the collapse of prices after 1929, and the reversal of the flow of capital from creditor to debtor countries. Undoubtedly the removal of these restrictions would be facilitated by rising commodity prices and some resumption of foreign lending by creditor countries. But the events of the last eight years cannot be reversed entirely, and many of the policies adopted in the emergency are of a kind which cannot be easily abandoned.32. In the first place, it is important to bear in mind that the depression has been the occasion of a fundamental change in the channels of trade, which would in more normal circumstances have been spread over a much longer period. One of the consequences of the long period before the war, during which this country had pursued a policy of free trade, and the rest of industrial Europe and the United States a policy of industrial protection, had been the development of a specialisation of British manufacturing industries in conformity with the rather intricate series of transactions by means of which the British and Continental imports of American foodstuffs and raw materials were paid for. Briefly, these transactions were as follows : the United States imported raw materials from the Far East and India; India and the Far East imported manufactured goods, principally cotton textiles, from Great Britain, and, in addition, made substantial payments to Great Britain in the form of interest and dividends; Great Britain imported a wide range of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods from the Continent; and the Continent was thus enabled to finance its purchases of raw materials from the United States. This source of finance was supplemented before the war by interest and dividend payments from the United States to Great Britain and the Continent. The change in the status of the United States after the war from that of a debtor to that of a creditor naturally put considerable strain upon this chain of purchases; but the position was alleviated for the time being by two circumstances: first, the great growth in the American demand for Eastern raw materials, notably rubber and silk, and the high prices which these commodities for a time commanded; and, secondly, the steady stream of loans from the United States to the countries of Central and South-Eastern Europe, especially in and after 1927.33. In 1929 for a number of causes, the precarious equilibrium which had been maintained after the war began to disappear. But the events which followed were immeasurably complicated by the collapse of demand in the United States which followed the Wall Street crash in the autumn of 1929. For the effect of this, and in a lesser degree of the Ffawley-Smoot tariff which came into effect at about the same time, was effectively to prevent any possibility of adjustment by Europe to the drying up of loan receipts from the United States, through an expansion of exports to the United States, or to the countries supplying raw materials to the United States. The position of the Far Eastern countries was-at once affected by the collapse of American demand, and as a result the process [15962] E
-of industrialisation which had already begun was greatly accelerated, and British markets in that quarter of the world suffered a great contraction. At the same time the purchasing power of Central European countries was rapidly reduced by the cessation of American lending, and in order to maintain their power to import they were forced to offer their goods on the free market of Great Britain. Thus in the first stages of the depression the financial strain caused by a very large favourable balance of payments in the United States unsupported by adequate foreign lending fell heavily upon Great Britain. The crisis of 1931 was the consequence, as a result of which Great Britain made a series of fundamental changes in her trade policy, the most important of which was the adoption of industrial protection, with its corollary of greatly reduced purchases from Continental Europe. The final stage has been the diversion of European purchases of raw materials from the United States to those primary producing countries where industrial protection is less pronounced.34. The occurrence of an exceptionally severe depression in the United States at a time when in any event some difficulties were likely to occur in the financing of European purchases of American raw materials must be blamed for a large proportion of the restrictions on international trade. But the subsequent recovery in the United States, though it has led to a great amelioration of the position, and has been associated with a substantial revival in international trade, has not restored the position prevailing before the depression. For in the meantime, as we have observed, the industrialisation of the Far Eastern countries and of India has proceeded at a greatly accelerated pace, and in consequence those markets for some classes of British textiles have disappeared, probably for good. In these circumstances Great Britain will not be in a position to accept substantial quantities of European-manufactured goods until she has been able to develop new trade with the Far East, or with other markets from which the United States draws its imports of raw materials. The development of new trade with these markets is for the moment hampered by the pressure under which British industry is operating by reason of the activity of the internal market.35. Moreover, the equilibrium which was recently established is at several points dependent on artificial support. We may instance the fact that a not inconsiderable part of the remaining British exports of cotton textiles is only possible because of the quantitative restrictions on competitive Japanese exports, and the fact that the diversion of European purchases of raw materials from the United States is made possible only by the very rigorous control over these purchases exercised by the governments concerned. These conditions are likely to obtain for some while, until adjustment has been made in the supplying countries to the changed conditions of demand.36. The restrictions upon international dealings now prevalent were not merely made in response to the necessity of changes in the channels of trade required by the collapse of demand in the United States. They were also the consequence of the sudden attempt made in the depression to withdraw capital advanced in the previous boom to the debtor countries. This withdrawal of capital was on a scale which could not be met out of the exiguous reserves of gold and foreign currencies in the possession of the debtor countries, and, in view of the impossibility of developing an adequate favourable balance of payments with the creditor countries, some restriction on the export of capital was essential. But one effect of the existence of restrictions on the movement of funds in the debtor countries has been to put a premium on the possession of funds in countries not subject to restriction, with the consequence that the removal of restrictions would lead to a wholesale export of domestic capital seeking safeguards against the reimposition of restriction. The solution found by the debtor countries for the problem of the withdrawal of foreign capital has given rise to a new problem, that of the possible expatriation of domestic capital, which is much more formidable and which may require the perpetuation of the system of restrictions long after the causes which led to them have ceased to operate.37. . Rather similar effects have followed from the control of foreign trade exercised in so many countries. One of the effects of this control has been to perpetuate, and indeed to accentuate, the discrepancy between internal and external prices.   This in turn has led to increasing difficulties in the way of
exporting, and ultimately to still further interference with the conditions under which trade is carried on, either in the direction of clearing agreements, export subsidies or the quoting, of special exchange rates for particular classes of foreign exchange.38. A further obstacle to the loosening of restrictions on trade arises from the preoccupation of so many European governments with the possibility of war This has led them to favour trade policies which expose them to the smallest possible risk of an interruption of supplies in the event of hostilities, and to neglect those opportunities for the expansion of trade which are exposed to this danger. Moreover, the demands which rearmament makes upon the productive resources of the principal European countries leads them to prefer to balance their international accounts by measures which involve a reduction of the less essential imports. Again the financial strain of rearmament has led all of the governments concerned to make heavy demands on the resources of their capital markets. The desire to preserve their privileged place in these markets may contribute to their unwillingness to allow capital to find its way abroad.39. These considerations inevitably lead us to the view that the process of freeing international trade from the restrictions which hamper it is likely to be long drawn out. Confidence in the stability of the currencies now subject to restriction will not quickly revive. The adjustment of internal to external prices, involving, as it may do in many instances, the depreciation of the currencies concerned to a lower level, and the disappearance of the complicated systems by means of which imports are now being restricted and exports fostered, is unlikely to be achieved at a single step. The readjustment of productive capacity to the situation created by the changes which have occurred in the channels of trade may take a considerable time. Given the necessary conditions, however, there is reason to suppose that there may be some reversal of the tendencies towards greater restrictions on international trade which have been in evidence since the war.40. The conditions to which we refer are, first, that there should be no major setback in demand in the two great creditor countries, the United Kingdom and the United States; secondly, that the general tendency of prices over a period of years should be upwards; and, lastly, that there should be a real willingness on the part of the principal trading countries, again especially the United Kingdom and the United States, to negotiate trade agreements for the mutual lowering of tariffs and for the abolition of trade restrictions. It is because we attach great importance to the consolidation of American opinion behind the policy now being pursued by Mr. Cordell Hull that we share the hopes which have been generally expressed that it will be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to negotiate a mutually satisfactory trading agreement with the government of the United States. If these conditions are fulfilled, we may hope to see a greater measure of equilibrium established between the different countries, both as regards internal price levels and external exchange relations.41. We have already, in a previous report, expressed our views as to the measures which may require to be taken to maintain trade activity in this country on a comparatively even keel. The question of the long-period tendency of prices, however, raises a number of different considerations. Disadvantages attach to any pronounced tendency for the price level either to rise or to fall, except perhaps in the case of a gradually falling level of prices in conformity with the improvement of industrial technique. The evils attending a fall in prices have been too recently experienced to require elaboration. They are the result of the depressing effect which falling prices exert upon the level of profits. When prices are rising, on the other hand, profits tend to be unduly high, with the result that the standard of living of the working classes tends to be depressed. To quote a well-known example, the rise in the level of real wages which had been rapid in the latter part of the nineteenth centmy, was checked during the period of gradually rising prices after the turn of the century, and this was an important reason for the disturbed industrial history of that period. But it is precisely because of this tendency that periods of rising prices are, on the whole, favourable to the growth of international trade. For the pressure which a rising-[15962] e 2
cost of living exerts upon their standard of living inclines the consuming public to demand a relaxation of those tariff measures which enhance prices, and the high level of profits diminishes the opposition of those who would benefit from the maintenance of tariffs. To quote another historical example, the rising tendency of prices, often attributed to the gold discoveries in the forties, assisted the international movement towards freer trade which was set in motion by the reforms of Sir Robert Peel&apos;s government, and which culminated in the negotia-tion of Cobden&apos;s commercial treaty with France in 1860, and it was the decline in prices from 1870 onwards which reversed the policy of our principal European competitors in the latter part of the nineteenth century.42. There is another respect in which a rise in prices may assist economic recovery, namely the relief which it is likely to afford to the difficult budgetary situation of many countries. A substantial share of the charges on the budget are in respect of interest and other payments on past loans. In this country, for example, not only must the direct debt charges of the government be considered, but also those payments to local authorities under the heading of housing, education, &amp;c, which represent grants towards the loan charges of local authorities in respect of these services. Again a large part of the remaining charges on the budget, e.g., contributions to social insurance schemes, are fixed in terms of money, and would only respond gradually to increases in the cost of living. Furthermore, with a highly progressive system of direct taxation such as is in force in this country, a rise in the general level of incomes gives rise in time to proportionately higher tax payments, without any change in the rates of taxation. Nevertheless, it is important not to exaggerate the relief which higher prices would bring to the budget. If prices rise, the cost of all government supplies and most services tend to rise sooner than the yield of taxation, and even in the case of debt payments, the benefit accruing to the government from the rise in prices may be greatly reduced by a rise in the rate of interest. For past experience shows that periods of rising prices are periods of high interest rates on government securities, presumably because the attractions which equity shares offer to investors are comparatively greater in such periods.43. The advantages which attach to a higher level of prices can only be expected if the rise which brings about the change in the price level is gradual. As we observed in our last report, a sudden and excessive rise in prices in a period of good trade, is likely to aggravate the difficulties encountered in the course of the subsequent reaction. A rise in prices occurring in such circumstances is likely to be extremely vulnerable in the event of a change in economic conditions, and to be succeeded by an equally severe and precipitate fall. We reiterate, therefore, the conclusions which we reached in our last report, as to the importance of avoiding, as far as possible, any sharp rise in prices during the next few years. The inference which we draw from the foregoing considerations is that, in the re-establishment of an international monetary system, it is important to have regard to the influence which such a system must have on the long period tendency of prices, and to secure that it shall not be such as to call for violent deflationary measures on the part of individual countries, in the event of a minor set-back in trade.44. It is with these considerations in mind that we approach the subject of international monetary relations and the place of gold in them. Our discussion of this subject involves us at times in the consideration of points of some intricacy which may obscure the drift of our argument. For this reason we have inserted at this point (paragraph 45 below) an outline of the main stages of the remainder of our report. In this summary the qualifications which we attach to our conclu-sions are omitted, and it requires to be read in the light of this consideration.45.-(i) In order to reduce the obstacles to international trade it is essential to increase the confidence of all countries in the liquidity of their position. As in the case of domestic trade, this requires an abundance of 1&apos; cash &apos;&apos; available for meeting debts between nations.(ii) Gold is potentially the most readily acceptable form of international cash; for though large groups of countries are prepared to use short-term funds
in the main centres (e.g., London and New York) for this purpose, a number of important countries are not willing to subject themselves to the financial leader-ship of New York or London which this involves.(iii) There are at the present time adequate supplies of gold which could be used for this purpose if only they could be put into circulation.(iv) Although gold is available for this purpose, it is not being used. It is tending rather to accumulate in New York and London, where its presence is an embarrassment.(v) The reasons for this accumulation of gold are first the inability or unwillingness of most of the minor central banks to invest their reserves in the form of gold, and secondly the flow of capital to the United States. Although other causes have been at work in the past, to-day capital is flowing to the United States and in a lesser degree to Great Britain, because these are the only markets in which gold may readily be disposed of.(vi) The restoration of the free circulation of gold therefore depends on the creation of a market for gold outside the principal creditor countries. The obstacles in the way of this are : (a) technically the facilities for dealing in gold are less well developed thanthose for dealing in currency;(b) there are or have been fears abroad lest the ultimate value of gold interms of the principal currencies may fall;(c) the possibility of substantial fluctuations in the relative values of theprincipal currencies makes it more convenient for the smaller countries to attach their currencies closely to the pound or the dollar, in which the bulk of their trade is carried on, rather than to hold their reserves in gold.(vii) We believe that certain steps could be taken to improve the facilities for dealing in gold. The most important of these is the return to the practice of quoting buying and selling prices for gold on the part of as many central banks as possible.(viii) The restoration of confidence in the ultimate value of gold is a question of greater difficulty.(a) Despite appearances to the contrary we do not believe that the value ofthe present stock of gold is excessive having regard to the turnover which it is required to finance.(b) On the other hand the present value of the current output of gold isunduly high. The purchase of this output is a heavy burden on those parts of the world not engaged in gold production. Moreover in the long run the whole of this burden is likely to fall on the creditor countries, and on the United States in particular.(c) British interests, however, are on the whole promoted by a high price forgold, because the British Empire is responsible for more than half of the world&apos;s gold production, and the balance of payments of the sterling area is at present dependent on the sale of gold.(d) Nevertheless, if the United States were to take steps to reduce the valueof the current gold output in terms of commodities, it would probably be impossible for this country not to follow suit.(e) The value of gold in terms of commodities, and therefore the real burdenof acquiring the current output of gold, would be reduced either by an increase in the prices of commodities in terms of money, or by a reduction in the price of gold in terms of money. Both these courses, if carried to a point at which they would afford substantial relief to the United States, axe open to grave objections, from the point of view of the United States as well as of this country. The objections to the latter course are the more formidable of the two. In these circumstances the United States authorities may seek for other expedients to reduce the cost to them of purchasing the new output of gold.&apos;(/) Such developments would inevitably harm British gold producing interests; but if their effect were to revive confidence in the ultimate value of gold there might be compensating advantages.
(ix) As regards the question of the return to a system of fixed gold parities for the principal currencies, the principal arguments on one side and on the other appear to be : (a) A number of countries are not prepared to abandon their systems ofexchange and trade control on any other terms.(b) Unless there is real stability of the exchanges the central banks of thesmaller countries will find it more convenient to carry their reserves in sterling or dollars rather than in gold.(c) A return to fixed parities would promote international lending, bothby extending the facilities now available to wider circles of commercial borrowers and by increasing the period over which loans between different centres can be made. It might lead finally to some revival of international long-term lending. This would facilitate the redistribution of the world&apos;s gold &quot;supplies.(d) On the other side, a return to the gold standard, even with substantialmodifications, might diminish the effectiveness of monetary policy as a means of stabilising internal trade conditions.(e) It would expose the price level to the risks of considerable upward ordownward movements, induced by changes in the conditions of gold supply.(/) If the gold standard were to collapse for a second time it would impair possibly for ever the position of gold as an international medium of exchange.(x) We do not believe that a final decision can at present be taken on this question. Nevertheless it requires to be examined in an atmosphere free from the preconceptions which now surround it.46. International trade can be carried on without the intervention of transactions in what is now called the foreign exchange market. But the advantages of international exchange dealings are that through them a common pool of working capital is set up from which all international transactions may be financed, and they thus allow the development of intricate trading relations, which would be quite impossible without them. Moreover, this pool of capital can be expanded readily, and so facilitates the growth of international trade. But it carries with it certain disadvantages. First, it involves borrowing in one currency, and lending in another, and therefore introduces a special element of risk into international trade, the risk of exchange losses. Secondly, there is the danger that capital may be borrowed from the international pool, not to finance an expansion of trade, but to cover a growth of indebtedness which really calls for more permanent financing. Finally, the existence of a considerable volume of international short-term indebtedness carries with it the risk of periodic crises of confidence to which all credit systems, national or international, have been found to be exposed.47. The pre-war gold standard attempted to meet some of these difficulties. Its principles were, first, the maintenance of stable exchange rates; secondly, the development of a highly specialised bill market which regulated the demands made upon the pool of international working capital by each country; and thirdly, a convention whereby credit conditions in every country were regulated in accordance with the stock of gold which it held. The last of these provisions secured that prices moved more or less uniformly in every country adhering to the gold standard, as was required if exchange stability was to be maintained. But it had the disadvantage that it greatly hampered the use of credit policy as a method of controlling fluctuations in domestic trade activity. The machinery of the pre-war gold standard did not provide any automatic corrective for the disturbance to international trade which occurred whenever financial distrust led to the widespread calling in of short-term loans. On these occasions a special responsibility used to rest upon the Bank of England and the British money market, and this responsibility they were only able to assume because of the undisputed currency of a bill drawn upon London as an instrument of inter-national credit. The comparative precision with which this system worked enabled the gold standard to be operated on a very narrow stock of gold, and, indeed, it might have been worked on an even smaller stock, had it not been for

Finally, the existence of a considerable volume of international short-term indebtedness carries with it the risk of periodic crises of confidence to which all credit systems, national or international, have been found to be exposed.47. The pre-war gold standard attempted to meet some of these difficulties. Its principles were, first, the maintenance of stable exchange rates; secondly, the development of a highly specialised bill market which regulated the demands made upon the pool of international working capital by each country; and thirdly, a convention whereby credit conditions in every country were regulated in accordance with the stock of gold which it held. The last of these provisions secured that prices moved more or less uniformly in every country adhering to the gold standard, as was required if exchange stability was to be maintained. But it had the disadvantage that it greatly hampered the use of credit policy as a method of controlling fluctuations in domestic trade activity. The machinery of the pre-war gold standard did not provide any automatic corrective for the disturbance to international trade which occurred whenever financial distrust led to the widespread calling in of short-term loans. On these occasions a special responsibility used to rest upon the Bank of England and the British money market, and this responsibility they were only able to assume because of the undisputed currency of a bill drawn upon London as an instrument of inter-national credit. The comparative precision with which this system worked enabled the gold standard to be operated on a very narrow stock of gold, and, indeed, it might have been worked on an even smaller stock, had it not been for
the fact that gold was used by many countries as an internal circulating medium, the demand for which was naturally subject to fairly considerable fluctuations* and for the fact that a number of&apos; countries maintained a large stock of gold as a reserve for use in time of war.48. Any system which is based on the existence of large-scale borrowing and lending must provide some recognised medium by means of which debts may be discharged. This has always been the recognised function of gold (and pre-viously of silver) in international dealings, and it is because of this that gold commands the price it does. When, therefore, we envisage the restoration of an international monetary system it is natural to suppose that in this respect gold Avill play its traditional part. For though it is possible that large groups of countries may be willing to accept the currency of one among them as a good discharge for debts, as the English pound is current among countries of the sterling area, and the dollar among a large proportion of the Central and South American republics, yet neither pounds nor dollars are likely to be accepted everywhere for this purpose. Nevertheless, it is probable that in any revived international system the place which will be taken by gold will be very different from that which it occupied before the war. In the first place it seems most unlikely that for a very long time to come internal credit conditions will come to be regulated in accordance with the supplies of gold. In the face of the present abnormal movements of gold the whole tendency of modern practice has been to insulate the supply of credit from the influence which gold movements would have upon it, if pre-existing banking policy were strictly followed. We may instance the setting up of the British Exchange Equalisation Account, and the funds set up in imitation of it in France and Holland, and the Inactive Gold Fund set up in the United States.49. Secondly, gold movements are no longer an index of the extent to which countries are over-borrowing from the fund of international working capital, to meet indebtedness which should properly be financed by long-term borrowing. They arise to-day far more from movements of capital for investment in stock exchange securities which, since the growth of dealings in international securities, has become much more fluid than before the war. Again, now that credit policy in the different countries is no longer closely interlocked, the temporary divergences which occur in balances of payments are much larger than before the war, and the pool of international capital must be great enough to take care of the demands upon it which will arise from this cause. Moreover, the uncertainty which is felt about the stability of exchanges must have the result that movements of short-term capital, which under the pre-war system were induced by changes in interest rates and were compensatory to the movement of long-term capital and of the balance of payments on current account, will for some time at least tend to be in the same direction as these other elements, and thus to intensify the strain placed on gold reserves.50. Finally, the experience of the crisis of 1930-31 has shown that the Bank of England is no longer in a position to stem an international crisis of confidence at the outset by the wholesale creation of credit. It is clear that debtor countries must in future carry very much greater reserves to meet the possibility of panic withdrawals of capital, than used to be the case when they could rely in an emergency on the willingness of the London money market to make advances on any sound banking security,51. The conclusion which we draw from the foregoing considerations is that to maintain reasonable stability in international dealings the value of the supplies of gold which are used to support these dealings requires in the future to be very large in relation to the volume of dealings, that large-scale gold movements should be looked upon as a normal element in the preservation of financial equili-hrium, and that the stocks of gold in monetary use should be widely distributed. Given these conditions it may be hoped that international monetary dealings in* In so far as the pre-war gold standard made in general for high interest rates in times of general boom and low interest rates in time of general depression, and thus contributed to the stability of trade conditions, it was because of these fluctuations in the demand for gold as an internal circulating medium. The criticisms which have been directed against the automatic operation of the gold standard are founded on the fact that this control over internal credit conditions, quite apart from the danger that it might be interfered with by more or less irrelevant events abroad, was uncertain and often unfortunately timed.
connection with international trade will revive on a substantial scale. Moreover, as confidence in the system grows, economies in the use of gold may be expected to occur, and the existing stock of gold should be adequate to support a volume of transactions substantially higher than the present without disturbance of the level of prices, even though these should show some advance. It may even happen that at some future date, when confidence in the stability of international monetary relations has revived, the present stocks of gold may prove to be redundant. But that is a contingency which, though it may give rise to serious problems in the future, may be disregarded for the present.52. The value of the present stock of gold is very large in relation to the value of, for example world trade, partly because of the great increase which has taken place in the volume of monetary gold in existence as a result of increasing production and the dissipation of Eastern hoards, partly because the value of gold in terms of the currencies of most countries is 60 to 70 per cent, higher than in 1929, and partly because the value of world trade in terms of national currencies is still substantially smaller than in 1929. We reproduce below an estimate of the Union Corporation of the present stocks of monetary gold, and attach thereto the League of Nations estimate of the value of world trade (average of import and export figures) in terms of ounces of fine gold.Table 24.

One striking feature of the foregoing table is the tremendous fluctuation which has taken place in the gold holdings of the Bank of France. In 1929 these amounted to nearly 80 million ounces; by 1932 they had doubled; at the present time they have fallen again to 70 million ounces. They reflect the ebb and flow of French capital in search of security from the risks of loss first abroad and then at home. These movements have greatly intensified the difficulty inherent in monetary management since the war. They accentuated the shortage of gold in the crisis of 1930-32; they have added substantially to the problem of the super-abundance of gold which has begun to appear since 1935. During the last few weeks there has been evidence of some return of gold to France, and it is possible that the tide of capital movements is turning once again in that direction. If this is the case the seriousness of the gold problem in those other creditor countries in which French capital has found refuge will be relieved, at any rate for a time.54. The increase in the relative value of the world&apos;s available stocks of gold in relation to the turnover which it is required to finance is to be welcomed, on the ground that it may assist in the removal of some of the great difficulties which have stood hitherto in the way of the expansion of world trade.   Unfortunately,
however, the greater ease which might be expected to follow from this increase in the supply of gold has on the whole failed to appear, principally because the distribution of gold has become progressively more unsatisfactory. If from the total supplies of gold available for monetary use are deducted the amounts of gold hoarded, and the amounts held in the six most important financial centres, London, New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich and Brussels, and that assumed to be held in the Soviet Union, the remainder, distributed among all the other countries of the world, has been as follows :-End of-	1929.	1932.	1935.	1936.Gold held in smaller centres (millions of fine ounces)	168-1	120-4	113-7	108-455. The present maldistribution of gold is the consequence of the sharp reversal of the flow of capital in international lending which followed the breakdown of confidence in the course of the depression, though it has been accentuated by the restrictions on exchange dealings and the distrust of their domestic currencies which prevents the nationals of countries whose gold supplies are inadequate repatriating their foreign balances. The resulting shortage of international working capital in these countries has been one of the principal obstacles to the rapid development of international trade. In many parts of the world the higher level of raw material prices is to-day providing a natural remedy for this state of affairs. For it has led to the accumulation of very considerable balances either in London or New York by the countries producing raw materials. We may give as examples the great increase in London funds held by Australia and India, and the increase in funds held in New York by South and Central American countries. These balances have been accumulated out of favourable balances of payments on current account, and, thanks to them, a number of countries which previously maintained some form of exchange control have been able to relax this control. In consequence, the free movement of goods and capital has been facilitated. Even in these cases, however, the improvement in the position of the debtor countries has not led to any redistribution of gold, but only to the piling up of short-term balances in London and New York.56. Since the end of 1934, the decline in the gold holdings of the smaller centres is attributable to the dissipation of the gold reserves of Italy and Spain. In the two years 1935 and 1936, the gold holdings of the smaller centres apart from Italy and Spain increased by 3-6 million ounces. But the funds in New York owned by banks in these countries increased by an amount equal to the value of from 12 to 13 million ounces of gold, and the sterling balances of the same countries must also have shown a substantial increase. The original cause of the decline in the gold holdings of the smaller centres was the withdrawal of capital by the creditor countries. But more recently, in spite of the fact that the with-drawal has continued, the position of the debtor countries has improved to such an extent that a substantial increase in their reserves has been possible. Yet they have preferred to hold these reserves in the form of dollar and sterling balances rather than in the form of gold.57. It may be argued that so long as the liquid position of the debtor countries is improved, it is a matter of indifference whether the reserves which they acquire are held in the form of gold or in the form of dollar or sterling balances, against which gold is held by the monetary authorities in New York or London. This argument, however, neglects several very important practical con-sequences. In the first place the value of gold depends entirely on the willing-ness of central banks to buy any quantity of it offered in the market. If the majority of central banks withdraw from the market, the effect is to make the value of gold much more precarious. If, for example, the only buyers of gold came to be the British and American Treasuries operating through their exchange accounts, the only reason why the British account would buy would be that it believed that it could subsequently resell to the American account, and the only reason why the American account would buy would be that it believed that it could subsequently resell to the British account. It is hard to suppose that either account would be prepared to extend its commitments indefinitely on such a flimsy [15962] F
foundation. Secondly, the growth of short-term liabilities in London and New York would expose both centres to the risk of very great fluctuations in the amount of money deposited with them in accordance with changes in speculative sentiment; and, however much the technique of operating exchange accounts is improved, it is improbable that these movements could occur without considerable financial dislocation.58. Even more serious disadvantages attach to the practice of maintaining central bank reserves in the form of balances with foreign countries, by reason of the effect which the restricted market for gold has upon the flow of capital in international lending. In the days of the gold standard it used to be accepted that the Aoav of gold from one country to another was largely determined by the flow of capital; now it is becoming increasingly the case that the flow of capital is determined by the flow of gold. The funds which find their way to London and New York through the sale of gold cannot be withdrawn so long as the countries who own the funds, or those who might be willing to borrow these funds, refuse to add to their gold holdings. The balance of capital movements to London and New York is therefore determined by the amount of gold imported to these centres. Thus so long as a market for gold is only to be found in the creditor countries the flow of capital will be in their direction. Yet at the present time the great need is for a reversal of the flow of capital, so that the benefits of cheap money and increasing liquidity may be widely spread throughout the world.59. We conclude therefore that without a substantial dispersal of the gold now held in New York, and perhaps in a lesser degree in London and elsewhere, the mere existence of the present large stock of gold is not enough to secure a further substantial improvement in international financial relations. The distribution of gold requires to be improved, and if that is to be achieved there must be in the first place a reversal of the flow of capital which is now flowing from the debtor to the creditor countries, and in the second place central banks must be willing to carry their reserves in the form of gold, rather than as deposits in New York and London. As we have seen, the two problems are interrelated; the flow of capital outwards from the creditor countries would be greatly assisted by the development of markets for gold in other centres besides New York, London and Amsterdam.60. We have in previous reports drawn attention to the analogy between the place of gold in the international monetary system, and of central bank deposits in a national system. As is well known central bank deposits may be expanded either by the purchase of securities, which corresponds to long-term lending by countries with excessive gold reserves in the international sphere, or by a reduction of the discount rate which leads normally to short-term borrowing. At the present time the expansion of international credit by long-term lending is hampered by the disfavour with which this form of investment is regarded by the ordinary investor, and, indeed, the movement of long-term capital is still in a direction which reduces rather than expands the supply of international credit. Moreover, the short-term borrowing of funds in the foreign centres where gold is available as a means of replenishing gold reserves is a matter involving the borrowing country in very considerable risk by reason of the danger that the price of gold may alter to their disadvantage in the lending centre. For these reasons the expansion of international credit, which has taken place since the depression, has not taken the form of a redistribution of gold, but has been effected by the increase of the short-term liabilities of the countries which form the financial centre of a group of dependent countries. Thus gold is ceasing to be a universal medium of international trade, and its use is confined to the adjustment of move-ments of funds between three or four financial centres. Moreover, there are a number of countries which though they have no substantial gold reserves of their own, yet, partly for reasons of prestige, are not prepared to accept the financial leadership of London or New York, and still less that of Paris or Amsterdam, and for these countries it may be said that there is to-day no international financial system in existence.61. The central bank of a country, such as the Argentine, which holds a reserve against day to day fluctuations in the demands made upon it for foreign exchange is presumably influenced by some such considerations as these. First, it needs to be able to convert these reserves easily and cheaply into that currency
which it is called upon to supply, and, secondly, it needs to be as certain as circumstances permit that the value of its reserves will not depreciate through events over which it has no control in comparison with the liabilities which it will be called upon to meet. At the moment gold has grave disadvantages in both respects. It is much more difficult to convert gold into, say, lire than to convert dollars into lire. As regards the second point, gold was until recently regarded as more stable in value than even the principal currencies, and is still preferred to many currencies in a number of European countries. But the doubts raised as to the policy of the principal powers with regard to gold has now impaired the confidence of many central banks in the holding of reserves in that form. Finally, reserves held in a foreign currency may earn a small rate of interest.62. The considerations advanced in the two preceding paragraphs suggest that the question of the maldistribution of gold may be subdivided into three subordinate problems. There is first the technical problem of improving the efficiency of gold as a reserve of purchasing power in foreign currencies. Secondly, there is the question of establishing a stable foundation for confidence in the value of gold in terms of the principal currencies. Finally, there is the question whether it is desirable to revert to the practice of maintaining more or less rigid relationships between the values of the principal currencies and gold, with the consequence that the principal currencies would have a stable relationship between themselves.63. The essence of the gold standard before the depression was the fact that the central banks of the countries adhering to the gold standard were always prepared to buy or sell gold in any amounts. It was this general willingness to buy on the part of a very large number of banks which gave gold its value as a reserve of international capital. It would greatly help to revive confidence in gold if central banks reverted to the policy of published buying and selling prices, even though they reserved to themselves the right to change these prices from time time to time. Without this change in policy there will be little prospect of re-establishing the effective use of gold in international exchange transactions. Nevertheless, since, as we have seen, it is extremely unlikely that the Governments of any of the principal countries are likely to be willing to use discount policy, as it was used in the past, to regulate the quantities of gold which they are called upon to accept or provide (for that would carry with it the sacrifice of the use of discount policy to regulate internal trade conditions) we do not believe that it would be possible to revert to the previous system without substantial modifica-tions. The first direction in which modification would be required is through the widening of the difference between buying and selling prices quoted for gold, a difference which for technical reasons is closely connected with the degree of divergence in the short-term rates of interest which can be quoted in different centres. But if there is a fairly wide range within which day to day fluctuations in the price of gold in different centres may occur, there will be risks of a depreciation in the value of gold in transit. Moreover, the fact that the physical transfer of gold necessarily takes time means that gold held in one centre cannot be made immediately available to meet claims in another. These difficulties would be overcome if there were a market for gold in each centre for forward delivery, so that gold could be sold before shipment.64. However great the technical facilities for dealing in gold, it cannot be expected that the central banks of the smaller countries will buy gold on au appreciable scale so long as there is doubt whether the value of gold may suffer ax\ appreciable fall in terms of the principal currencies. The events of the early summer, when rumours, however strongly denied, were current that the United States government intended to reduce the price of gold, served to show how wide-spread were these fears, and how easily they could be justified by reference to the estimates current of the present and prospective output of gold. We may emphasise at once our belief that these fears could be more easily justified in so far as they related to the excessive cost of purchasing the current output of gold, than when they were based on the opinion that the value of the existing stock of gold in monetary use at the present high price, was greater than the needs of the international situation demanded.65. We set out in the accompanying table the estimate made by the Union Corporation of the current output of gold.  In this table, as in the table of gold

Further-more, in 1929  25 millions worth of new gold was absorbed by India and other Asiatic countries and in the industrial arts, whereas in 1936  18 millions worth of gold was released from these sources. Thus the increased annual expenditure by the creditor nations which the absorption of the new output of gold already implies is about  200 millions a year; and, for the future, substantial increases in gold production are in contemplation, both in Russia and in South Africa, which may increase this figure even though Asia resumes its accustomed absorp-tion of gold for hoarding. It is because of the belief that the creditor nations will not be willing to provide so large an annual sum indefinitely that fears have arisen as to the ultimate price of gold.66. In these circumstances it may be well to inquire into the nature of the burden involved, both in the financing of the current output of gold, and in the holding of stocks of gold already in existence. The distribution of this burden is a matter of considerable complexity, but the extent of the burden itself is plain; it consists of the reduction of the world&apos;s output of useful goods caused by the diversion of productive resources involved in the output of a commodity which does not contribute to the standard of life. What the world forgoes because, for example, a large proportion of South African resources are devoted to gold mining is the quantity of other goods which these resources might have produced, and it must be remembered that in certain circumstances it is possible that these resources would, if not used in gold production, be entirely unemployed. But the burden on those parts of the world which are not engaged in gold production is greater than this. For the current value of the total output of the gold producing areas (including therein both gold and other commodities) would be smaller than it is if they were debarred from producing gold and were compelled to devote the resources now employed in gold-mining in the production of alternative goods which would be worth much less; and the rest of the world has to forgo not only the goods which the gold producing areas would otherwise produce, but also the extra goods in the rest of the world to which the gold producing areas become entitled so long as they can employ part of their resources in gold mining. In the circumstances of to-day, when the value of gold, in terms of commodities has been greatly enhanced by a number of special causes, the latter cause of loss to those parts of the world where gold is not produced is probably quite as serious as the former. We may observe that one of the effects of the present high value of gold is to enable a number of gold-producing debtor countries to repay obligations incurred through the import Of goods by the export of gold on terms very favourable to themselves.67. The purchase of gold from gold producers provides the latter with an income, but to provide these incomes it is necessary that an equivalent part of the woiid&apos;s savings should be directed towards investment in the form of gold. The need for this may be more readily understood by consideration of the case of a commodity, for example, copper, the price of which is principally dependent on current demand. The incomes of copper producers depend on the new resources directed towards the copper market. These new resources consist of two parts : first, the current demand for copper for industrial consumption,stocks above, the figure for the gold production of the Soviet Union is an unofficial estimate.Table 25. World gold production.
and, secondly, the speculative demand for copper as a form of investments If at any time the value of the output of copper at current prices exceeds the sum of these two sources of demand, the price must fall. In the case of gold, demand for current consumption is of trivial proportions, and the incomes of gold producers depend almost entirely on what in the case of copper might be called the speculative investment demand. In order to maintain the stability of gold in terms of money it is necessary for monetary authorities to maintain this demand at the appropriate level by absorbing as much of the new savings of the community as will finance the purchase of the current output of gold at the current price. The absorption of gold production thus involves either an expansion of savings by the amount of the value of newly mined gold, or to the extent that this is not forth-coming, a reduction in other, and more profitable, forms of investment. Like any other charge on the savings of the community, it therefore implies either a redistribution of income favourable to saving which normally takes place through a rise in prices or an increase in the rate of interest.68. Monetary authorities are generally in a position to buy gold, an invest-ment which yields no return, because they have at their disposal that part of the capital of the community on which no interest is demanded, namely, the capital which is held in the form of cash, that is bank notes and bank deposits. If, therefore, these authorities are to be in a position to absorb new gold supplies without incurring a loss of income, there must be a concurrent increase in the current demand for cash. This may occur for one of two reasons : either because there is an increase in prices and incomes generally which induces the public to withhold some part of its current income in the form of cash, in order to maintain its reserves of cash at &amp; level proportionate to its new rate of expenditure, or because the public is willing to hold cash (or its near equivalents, fixed bank deposits and short-term securities) as an investment because it believes that other forms of investment are likely to involve the owner in capital losses. In the case of most forms of investments, e.g., investment in working capital and ordinary shares, such a belief is inconsistent with a belief that prices will rise, as they are generally expected to do when current gold production is excessive. If, therefore, the public is willing, in such circumstances, to hold larger amounts of cash or its equivalents than are justified by the level of incomes, it can only be because of the belief that the prices of securities carrying a claim to a fixed money income will fall, since the trend of interest rates will be upward, and because the transfer of capital from the market for long-term fixed interest securities into bank deposits and the like exceeds the transfer of capital from bank deposits and the like for investment in working-capital and ordinary shares, whose prices are expected to rise. In the past an increase in the output of gold above the level at which it can be absorbed by the increase in cash holdings attributable to the normal increase in the level of incomes through the expansion of population and productivity has been associated both with a rising tendency of prices and a rising tendency of interest rates, the latter tendency acting as a kind of brake which has prevented the increased output of gold from immediately having its full ultimate effect on the price level. Failing an adequate market for new gold from one of the sources mentioned above, the interest required to attract the saving necessary for the holding of gold supplies can only be found by Governments out of their budgetary receipts, or, as has recently been clone in the United States, by requiring banks to carry reserves of cash in excess of those which ordinary banking considerations indicate, which is a form of concealed taxation upon the banking system.69. Although only the purchase of that part of the new gold supply which cannot be financed by an increase in the cash demanded by the public involves direct borrowing by the Government from the public, it must not be supposed that this part alone of the gold stock held by the monetary authority involves a charge on public funds. For if the resources at the disposal of the monetary authority by reason of the public&apos;s holding of cash were not invested in the form of gold, they would be available for investment in other directions, e.g., in Government securities, and in that case they would reduce the amount of the public debt in the hands of the public, and, in this country at any rate, where the profits of the note issue accrue to the Treasury, they would reduce the interest charges on the public debt actually payable by the Treasury.  In so far, therefore,* Which may, of course, at times be a negative quantity.
as the State and the monetary authority can be identified, the holding of gold involves an increase in the effective public debt, and involves a payment of interest by the State. A change in the price of gold, however, whether upwards or downwards, does not affect this charge, which is determined by the actual borrowing which the State or the monetary authority incurred at the time when gold was bought. The charge can only be reduced by the sale of gold. In this connection it may be noticed that the great size of the French budgetary deficit during the past three years has been facilitated because during that period the Bank of France has been steadily selling gold and placing the proceeds at the disposal of the French Government.70. The upshot of the foregoing discussion is that the financing of new gold production involves either a diversion of the savings of the community from profitable to unprofitable channels, or an increase in saving, which reacts upon the standard of living; and that the holding of the stocks of gold already in existence involves a charge for interest falling ultimately on the national budget. It may happen, however, that the country which provides the savings out of which the purchase of gold is effected may not be the country which buys the gold, for the savings may be lent by another country. In that event, the purchasing country does not have to forgo the profitable investment of its own savings; but it does have to provide the annual interest charge on the money borrowed from abroad. If this money is lent at short term, it may be, as in the circumstances to-day prevailing, that this annual charge is small, and that the real burden on the purchasing country is also small, But if, as is the case with much of the money lent to the United States, the money received from abroad is invested in stock exchange securities and the like, the real charge is much more substantial.71. The great bulk of the gold coming on to the market to-day, whether it be newly mined gold, or gold sold from the accumulations previously made by other central banks, is being bought to-day either by the United States or by the United Kingdom. But neither of these countries has to-day a favourable balance of payments on current account out of which to finance these purchases. Earlier, in the depression, this was not always the case so far as the United States was concerned. For there were times when a considerable part of her favourable balance was then devoted to the purchase of gold, and provided an outlet for savings which could not be made use of otherwise. The contribution which the United States and the United Kingdom are making to-day to the purchase of gold is the provision of interest representing a charge upon their own people.72. We have spoken hitherto as though the interests of the United Kingdom and of the United States in the matter of gold production entirely coincided. This is by no means the case. In the first place, under the conditions now prevailing, the United Kingdom is not bound to purchase gold in unlimited quantities at a fixed price so long as she is willing to see a change in the level of the exchanges, whereas for practical purposes the United States authorities do not refuse to buy all gold offered to them. In addition, the United Kingdom has to consider the interests of the Empire as a whole in gold production, and the adverse repercussions on British trade which might occur in the event of a falling off in the prosperity of the gold mining interests in British countries overseas. More than half of the world&apos;s gold production still takes place in the British Empire, and of this production only a comparatively small part is in Canada, which must for most purposes be regarded as coming within the orbit of the United States. Since the loss of markets which the United Kingdom has suffered in Asia, the countries of the Empire., and the principal gold producers in particular, have been responsible for a growing share of British overseas trade. British exports are, therefore, largely consigned to markets which, because they produce gold, have at the moment little difficulty in securing adequate supplies of foreign exchange, and in consequence the trade of this country is much less vulnerable to a contraction of trade induced by credit stringency than was the case before the depression. It is plain, therefore, that a collapse in the demand for gold at its present price is only likely to arise if the United States proves unwilling to continue to support the market.73. Nevertheless, should the United States take steps to reduce the support which it now gives to the gold market, we think it is clear that the United
Kingdom would be forced to follow suit. The actual steps which would lead to this result would vary according to the measures actually taken in the United States. But in every case the situation which would arise would involve this country in providing enormously increased resources for the support of the gold market at a time when the balance of payments of the sterling area was seriously impaired by a decrease in the current receipts from the sale of gold, and when therefore the exchange position of sterling would inevitably be causing consicler-able anxiety. We do not believe that this is a course which could be pursued without serious risk.74. The United States might seek to diminish the real burden falling upon it through the purchase of gold in a number of ways. The end in view might be achieved most directly either by encouraging an increase in the prices of commodities in terms of dollars (and therefore a decrease in the value of gold in terms of commodities), or by reducing the price of gold in terms of dollars. There are substantial objections to both these courses.75. Let us suppose, in the first instance, that the United States decided to allow imports of gold to have their full effect upon the credit structure until prices and incomes generally rose by, say, a third, so that the real cost of buying gold was reduced by a quarter. This would imply, in the first place, an abandon-ment for a time of all attempts to control credit in the interests of business stability, and would for that reason be a course of policy extremely distasteful to the American authorities. Again, when the rise in prices had been achieved, the stocks of monetary gold in existence in spite of the large inci&apos;ease which might be expected if current production continued at its present rate, relative to the value of world trade at the prices assumed to be established, would be substantially smaller than to-day. Moreover, the distribution of gold after the rise in prices might be even more unsatisfactory than to-day. For the effect of a real inflationary policy in the United States would be to attract foreign capital to Wall Street to participate in the stock exchange boom which would inevitably be associated with the rise in prices and incomes.76. Even more serious difficulties might be anticipated in the event of a reduction in the dollar price of gold. We assume that should the American authorities decide to take this step Great Britain would be forced to follow suit. For if it did not the pound would appear to be very much undervalued relative to the dollar, and the consequent inflow of capital would involve the exchange account in purchases of gold on a scale which it could not contemplate. In any event it is unlikely that the United States would proceed to a reduction in the price of gold except in consultation with this country, if only because she would be unwilling to experience the appreciation of the dollar in terms of sterling, which would otherwise occur. In these circumstances some part of the fall of the value of gold in terms of money would probably be offset by a fall in the value of commodities in terms of money, through the fall in commodity prices which might be induced by the change in the price of gold. This fall in prices would be brought about by the following causes. In the first place demand on the part of the gold producing areas would immediately be affected by anticipa-tions of reduced incomes as a consequence of the lower price of gold. Secondly, the liquid position of a number of countries, e.g., Japan and the Argentine, which hold gold as a reserve against drains of foreign exchange through an adverse balance of payments would be weakened by the fall in the value of these reserves, and they would tend to reduce their purchases of commodities in consequence. A further effect of an all-round reduction in the price of gold would be that the position of those countries, especially the United Kingdom and the United States which have been receiving foreign funds and which have bought gold against their possible withdrawal would be seriously weakened, for their liabilities in terms of gold would be increased. Finally, the fact that a strong belief has recently grown up that a reduction in the price of gold must lead to a fall in the prices of commodities, must tend to exaggerate any such fall as could properly be anticipated as a consequence of the influences set out above. To the foregoing disadvantages of a reduction in the price of gold there must be added the over-riding objection that on the whole there is no reason to suppose that t)he present stocks of gold at their present value are excessive, having regard to functions which gold will have to perform, if international monetary dealings are to revive.   Moreover, it is often argued, possibly with considerable weight,
that a reduction in the price of gold would undermine confidence in gold, and that without confidence in gold all attempts to restore international monetary-relations would be fruitless.77. Having regard to the difficulties inherent in a policy of increasing the value of commodities in terms of gold whether by raising commodity prices in terms of money or by diminishing the price of gold in terms of money, it is possible that the United States authorities will decide to continue tJheir present policy of buying gold freely at the present price, and preventing in so far as is possible the gold bought from affecting the internal supply of credit. On the other hand the real risk that by continuing to buy gold freely they will ultimately lose their position as a creditor country and become a debtor country may encourage them to look for other expedients to. which fewer disadvantages attach.78. Possibilities such as those which we have been discussing above must be present in the minds of all those responsible for the conduct of monetary policy in this country and abroad when they are called upon to decide whether or not to buy gold upon a substantial scale. Fears lest the pressure of circumstances may compel the authorities in the United States to pursue a policy which will diminish substantially the value of monetary reserves invested in gold must be a real obstacle in the way of re-establishing the willingness of central banks to hold large gold reserves. For this reason it may be necessary to take measures to reduce the annual tribute which gold producers are at present in a position to levy on the rest of the world before confidence in the future of gold can be restored to a point at which gold can take its accustomed place in international financial dealings. And, if that is the case, we think it is preferable that the policy actually adopted should be one that leaves the present monetary value of the world&apos;s stock of gold undiminished. But whatever steps are taken, a reduction in the current value of the output of new gold must react adversely on the position of gold producers. Moreover, since the crisis of 1930-31, the sale of gold has played an important part in the balance of payments of the sterling area as a whole, and too substantial an interference with this source of income might cause considerable dislocation in the field of international trade.79. We come finally to the question of the re-establishment of a fixed relationship between gold and the principal currencies. We are not prepared to advocate this step at the present time, and we feel that the clarification of a number of questions including, for example, the future course of gold production, the intentions of the United States authorities in regard to the price of gold, and their capacity to persevere in the policy they decide to pursue, the monetary system which ultimately emerges from the present financial confusion in France, and the extent to which expatriated French capital returns to France when this confusion ends will be required before the advantages and disadvantages of a return to the gold standard, however much modified, can properly be weighed up. Nevertheless, if attempts are to be made to revive an international financial system, the question of the return to fixed parities is bound to be raised and we feel that a preliminary survey of the ground may now be made. Moreover, there is sometimes a tendency to regard a return to the gold standard as an evil which can have no compensating advantages for us. Yet the prosperity of this country more than that of any other is bound up with the revival of international trade, and if it were true that a restoration of some sort of international gold standard is a condition of any large relaxation of trade barriers, and would in fact secure such relaxation, we, of all countries, should be prepared to examine the question.80. One important argument in favour of the return to fixed parities is that a number of countries which now maintain very rigid systems of trade restriction are not prepared to abandon these systems on any other terms. They stress the impossibility of any substantial action being taken in the absence of a more stable relationship between the internal price levels and between the currencies of the different countries. So long as currency depreciation may suddenly reduce the prices at which a country can export by 30 per cent, or 40 per cent., and enable its exports to be dumped at excessively low prices, other countries will certainly maintain the machinery of quotas and other restrictions against imports. Moreover, they also feel bound to retain this machinery to meet subsidy-dised exports arbitrarily directed to their markets by countries with an exchange control.  On the other hand, most of the countries with exchange controls take the
view that their people would never accept a fluctuating exchange; that there would be a panic flight of capital if such a prospect were in view; and that they cannot restore freedom to their exchanges unless they can link themselves up with other countries in a new international standard. We do not, of course, wish to suggest that the restoration of the gold standard is the only condition necessary to the ending of systems of trade restriction. In most countries, and especially in Germany and Italy, this is clearly not the case.81. Secondly, the return to fixed parities between gold and the principal currencies would greatly increase the willingness of the central banks of the financially less important countries to hold their reserves in the form of gold. For only in this event can they be sure that the value of the gold reserves they hold will not show a material depreciation in terms of the currency in which their liabilities are expressed at the time when they are called upon to meet them. As we have seen, the maldistribution of gold can only be corrected if smaller central banks are willing as well as able to buy gold.82. Finally, the return to fixed parities would facilitate the resumption of international lending for the financing of trade on an important scale. At the moment a certain amount of borrowing and lending does take place between those countries where there is no fear of the imposition of exchange restrictions, and where the credit standing of the principal banks is beyond reproach. But the scale of this borrowing is restricted by the comparatively narrow market for the hedging operations which they involve. Moreover, the practice of borrowing and lending money abroad might be expected to spread to much wider commercial circles once exchange movements were reduced within comparatively narrow limits. Furthermore, once the revival of short-term lending had introduced some confidence into the ability of the debtor nations to maintain their exchanges at the parities chosen, a gradual extension of the period for which foreign loans were made might be expected, and eventually there might be a revival of long-term lending, which would facilitate the redistribution of the world&apos;s gold supply.83. On the other side there are substantial arguments against a return to a regime of fixed parities. First, this is a course which we have in general opposed hitherto, on the grounds that (i) it would involve some renunciation of our liberty of action in the matter of credit policy, and (ii) it would imply that any diverging tendencies between British and international prices would call for correction through the cumbrous method of influencing the internal price level. These are substantial objections, and to disregard them might in certain circum-stances impose considerable penalties on the British economy. Moreover, objections based on these grounds are likely to be raised in this country and in some countries abroad. For as a result of the experiences of the late depression, public opinion now attaches much greater importance than hitherto to the preservation by monetary authorities of their freedom of action in times of depression, and believes, whether rightly or wrongly, that this freedom would be seriously curtailed by the return to a regime of fixed exchange parities however carefully this were safeguarded.84. It should be remembered, however, that this preoccupation is not shared by most of the countries of Europe which suffered the full effects of depreciated currencies during the decade after the War. In these countries public opinion demands above all else an assurance that the currency shall not again be allowed to collapse, with the consequent ruin of considerable sections of the population; and to avoid this risk, their peoples are prepared to put up with all the inter-ference to commercial activity entailed by the system of exchange control. This system, however, offers no solution for the disequilibrium of their internal economies, affected as these have been by vast programmes of armament and internal borrowing, and if there appeared a prospect of restoring an international currency system the Governments concerned would be pressed to readjust their economies in order to link them to such a system. The anxiety of their people to assure a more stable currency position would certainly be a more potent induce-ment to them to adopt a new orientation of their national policies than any external pressure is likely to be. The psychological condition in most of Europe is therefore radically different from that prevailing in this country; and the aspect of the gold standard system which excites most apprehension here may itself have a material effect in promoting international collaboration in Europe.
85. Secondly, the present annual output of gold is on so large a scale and the possibility that it may increase still further is so considerable, that it may prove&apos; impracticable in the long run to maintain the price of gold at its present level, and impracticable accordingly to sustain gold parities that might now be fixed. For, as we have seen, the burden which falls on the countries which purchase the newly-mined gold is a real burden, whether or not steps are taken to sterilise the gold that is bought. It represents, indeed, a contraction of the national income to the full extent of the value of the gold imported in any year. We must expect that the burden will in any case be borne in large degree by the people of the United States and Great Britain, and it might continue to fall on them almost exclusively even if the gold standard were restored. This burden might eventually become intolerable, if the annual output of gold remains at its present high level, still more if it increases further. Alternatively, if we were to assume a rise in the level of prices and in money costs of production sufficient to reduce materially the volume of gold production, the rise of prices required to effect this result might be so large as to cause a most serious disturbance of economic equilibrium. It should be observed, however, that the fact that the danger is now that a return to the gold standard will involve us in too rapidly rising prices means that one of the principal objections previously raised to this course, that it would necessitate an unduly restrictive financial policy, is now no longer valid. Moreover, this fact detracts to some extent from the force of the objection in paragraph 83 above. For, so long as gold is in excessive supply the control which the gold standard exercises over internal credit policy is very much reduced.86. Lastly, it must be borne in mind that the failure of a second attempt to re-establish an international monetary system through the return to fixed parities would make a much more lasting impression on the popular mind than the first failure, and would diminish such appeal as the promotion of international dealings may still retain as an objective of policy. For this reason it is desirable that the return to fixed parities should only be attempted in the most favourable circumstances.87. There is no doubt that the reduction of the risk and amplitude of major fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold itself should be a primary objective of policy. But if, when all that is possible in this direction has been done, it should appear that a return to fixed gold parities might involve undue risks, it is obviously desirable to inquire whether it may not be possible to elaborate, as a secondary objective, an agreement among the principal financial countries designed to reduce the risk that may still exist of major currency fluctuations also. Such an agreement, if it were feasible, might pave the way for a return to a regime of fixed gold parities, if circumstances rendered this desirable. The conditions under which provisional parities might be adopted are outside the scope of this report. But we hope to return to the examination of this question in a further report at an early date.88 The conclusion of our discussion is that there are three fields in which material alterations in existing policy may require to be made before international financial dealings can be revived. In two of these there are grounds for proceeding with great caution. The excessive value of current gold production in terms of commodities may require to be reduced before confidence in the future of gold can return; but this is primarily an American, and not a British problem, and the danger that a conflict of British and Empire interests may emerge suggests that so long as the United States is prepared to acquiesce in the present position, this country should follow suit. Moreover, the set-back which commodity and share prices have recently undergone in the United States will probably have the effect of diverting public interest from the question. As regards the return to fixed parities, we cannot be confident where the balance of advantage lies until the situation has undergone clarification in several directions, including notably the future output of gold. For the moment, therefore, the only direction in which practical steps may require to be taken is in the matter of improving the market for gold, and the most important step in this direction would be to adopt ourselves the practice of quoting buying and selling rates for gold, and.to encourage all other central banks to do the same.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
