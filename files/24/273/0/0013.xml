CONFIDENTIAL. A.C.  393.BOARD OP TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.State of Trade - October 1937.Summary of reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADE.    Imports in October at  96.1 m. were  15.6 m. more than in October, 1936.     Nearly 70% of the rise was in food and raw materials.     Of the increase of  4.6 m. in manufactured goods,  1.6 m. related to non-ferrous metals and manufactures and  1.4 m.  to iron and steel manufactures.     Exports of United Kingdom products,  4-7.2 m. were  5.5 m. more and re-exports,  5.7 m. were  1.1 m. more than in October, 1936.EMPLOYMENT.      The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 18th October - 1,390,249 - was 51,045 more than at 13th September;    the changes in the various divisions were:-London ........ + 21,804   North Eastern +   6,009South Eastern + 11,932 North Western - 10,538 South Western + 10,665 Northern .... - 423 Midlands ....      +    2,475    Scotland .... -   1,053Wales.......  n- 10,184The estimated number of insured workers aged. 16-64 in employment (excluding agricultural workers) was 11,659,000 - 47,000 less than in September of this year but 464,000 more than in October,  1936 (the figures for September, 1937, and October, 1936, have been revised).-1-
mEmployment improved between September and October in the cotton, tailoring, coal mining, shipbuilding and fishing industries and in the clock and harbour service. There were declines in the distributive trades, the hotel, shipping, road transport and railway services, the building, wool textile, linen, printing and bookbinding and general engineering industries, and in bread, biscuit etc., making.RAIL&apos;.;/AY TRAFFIC,     In the five weeks ended 51st OctoberRailway traffic receipts increased by 3?8&apos;1,000 (5.16;-)compared with the corresponding period of 1955.    The receipts from passenger traffic increased by 4.55..; merchandise,.minerals and livestock by 4.28/5 and coal, coke and patentfuel by 8.57;:.    These increases v/ere partly due to increased charges which became operative on 1st October.BANKING-*   Honey remained in ample supply.    The Treasurys, d.Bill rate at first rose to 10/9.45     but fell later to s. d.10/1.55. The price of gold was steady between 140s. 4d. and 140s.8d. The price of silver was also stead;-; considerable amounts were sent here from China for safe keeping.    Weakness on the London and New York Stock Exchanges apparently caused some repatriation of French capital.    There was a marked reeovery in the franc; the spot rate improved from 152-J- to 146-g- and the three months forward franc discount decreased from 12-g- to 5. The dollar declined from 4.943: to 4.96-5. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Belgium. Recent political developments led to renewed pressure on the belga.    The spot exchange was held but there was again a discount on forward belgas.France.    The franc \ eakened at the beginning of October but recovered quickly and fluctuated around 147. dotations for rente a ruse slightly. There v/ere indications that French industry is regaining some of its ability to compete in world markets.
Holland-,      Since devaluation Holland has achieved a great measure of recovery and external trade has expanded hut unemployment remains high,      During October money was in ample supply;    bonds were steady and long-term interest rates low; industrial and plantation shares fell sharply but later recovered somewhat.      The florin moved in sympathy with the dollar.Japan.      The money market remained quiet despite a seasonal demand for loans.      Stock prices rose following the Shanghai victory but Government bonds were unchanged.      There was an excess of exports over imports during October but for January-October     the trade balance was adverse.      A large measure of war time control is being extended over a wide range of finance and trade.Switzerland.      The Swiss franc was very firm.U.S.A.      Money rates continued easy.      The decline in stock prices continued, despite relaxation of the margin rules on stock loans and there is uneasiness among investors as to the financial industrial outlook.      The dollar moved between 4.94f - 4.96-g;    the premium on forward dollars was slightly lower.SHIPPING.    The general tendency of shipping freights continued downwards.      The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights (1913 s 100) was 170.13 as compared with 183.03 in September and 110.73 in October, 1936.      Recovery seems unlikely until tonnage is well spread again by a better demand in the long-distance trades.SHIPBUILDING.        Reports for October indicated a falling off in orders due mainly to rising prices of materials. Launching activity on the Clyde was at a high level but no orders for new tonnage were placed.
GOAL.    Conditions continued satisfactory- but less buoyant than earlier in the year.      Inland trade was good and industrial demand, shewed no weakening.      Output for the four weeks ended 16th October (19.52 rn.  tons) was 1.25 m.  tons more than in the corresponding period of 1936.      Exports in October amounted to 3.89 m.  tons as compared with 3.23 m.  tons a year before.      Most markets took more,   the main increases being to Italy,  Prance, Finland and Sweden.      In some districts the immediate future of the export trade is regarded with some apprehension.IROri AM) STEEL.    Pig iron production,  770,000 tons, was 100,000 tons more than in October 1936 and the highest for any month since the war.      Conditions on the pig-iron market have become somewhat easier.      Crude steel output,  1,134,000 tons, was 73,000 tons more than a year before.      Demand for semis and finished steel continued heavy, but the supply position was easier owing to increased Continental deliveries.      The outlook regarding ore and scrap supplies has considerably improved.      In spite of higher raw material costs,  it has been decided not to change prices of basic pig iron before 30th June 1938 or basic steel   products before the end of 1938.      Exports of iron and steel (207,000 tons) were 13,000 tons more than in October 1936. Imports (220,500 tons) were 119,500 tons more; supplies of semi-finished steel from the Continent have been improving.All districts were very busy.      In Scotland increased American supplies of pig iron and arrivals of American semis eased the position.      Local    open-hearth works were working almost to capacity.      On the ndrth-East Coast anxiety over supplies of ore from abroad diminished.      Host steel works have enough orders to keep them busy until the spring.      In the Sheffield area the record production of basic billets was easily absorbed,  and the heavy demand for alloy and stainless steels was unabated.      In South Wales,  tinplate operations increased to 80% of capacity. The first of the new furnaces at Ebbw Vale went into blast.
ENGINEERING.    The general condition of the industry was well maintained.    The volume of orders in hand is such that no marked recession seems likely in the near future.    The steel supply position showed some improvement.    Exports of machinery amounted to  4.6 m. as compared with  3,6 m.  in October, 1936.    Imports ( 2.1 m.) were  443,000 more.MOTOR BID US TRY.    The number   .   of motor vehicles newly registered in September was 29,054 - 2.3% less than a year before; the decrease in private cars was 5.7$.    The production of private cars in August was 20,888 (14,1% more than a year before) and of commercial vehicles 7,508 (0.4% less).    Exports of new private cars and chassis in October amounted to 6,372 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,916 - .3% less and 7.4% more respectively, than in October 1936.    1,444 complete new private cars were imported as compared with 868 a year ago.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.    Activity was fully maintained on existing contracts,  out new orders were less numerous.    Skilled labour is very scarce.    Demand for new radio receivers was very disappointing.     In heavy engineering export orders were -.,. i stained at about the level of October 1936, but considerably fewer home orders were received.    Exports of electrical apparatus and machinery ( 1.7 m.) were 18.2% more than in October 1936; electricity generated was 9% more.NON-FERROUS METALS.    The decline in metal markets continued. The chief influence was the further recession in industrial activity in the U.S.A.    Actual consumption outside the U.S.A. was probably well maintained but new orders may have been held up in view of the rapid fall in raw material prices.    In the United Kingdom, trade demand for lead and spelter was good, for tin moderate and for copper quiet.CHEMICALS.    Both home and export trade in alkalis shewed slight increases as compared with September.    Deliveries of chlorine products continued satisfactory.      Home sales of dyestuffs were expected to approach the very high level of October, 1936;
foreign sales were greater than a year ago.      Home sales of fertilisers were slightly higher than a year ago;    export sales were greater owing mainly to increased sales to Empire countries. The tar products market was rather unsettled.    Trade in wood distillation products was well maintained and in pharmaceutical chemicals about normal.COTTON.    In all sections there was an appreciable seasonal improvement in activity, but the volume of new business   was disappointing,    The daily yarn output index (1935 = 100) was 118 as compared with 110 in September and 115 in October 1936,    After a fall at the beginning of the month raw cotton prices steadied, but weakened again early in November;    spinners1 margins in general were maintained.      Yarn exports rose from 11.9 m.  lbs.  in September to 13.0 m.  lbs.  the same figure as that for October 1936. Exports of pieee goods in October,  at 154 m.  sq. yds.,  (the lowest monthly figure this year) were 3 m.  sq.  yds.  less than in Septemoer and 24 rn.  sq,  yds. less than the exceptionally high-figure for October, 1936.      Compared with Septeniuer the main decreases were to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and. the Dutch East Indies.      There were increases to India, Egypt, Colombia, Holland and French West Africa,WOQIu.      There was a marked decline in general activity.      Raw wool prices fell sharply.      Exports of tops and yarns were considerably less and exports of tissues slightly more in volume than in October, 1936.      All districts and sections reported reluctance by consumers to place new orders.SILK AND ARTIFICIAL SILK.    Rayon.    Conditions in the weaving trade were quieter and new business was scarce.    Demand for yarns from dress goods manufacturers was rather por.    Trade in staple fibre appeared to be affected by uncertainty regardiiig maintenance of existing cotton margins,    Exports of yarns were greater than in October, 1936, but exports of rayon fabrics and mixtures declined.SILK.    Silk manufacturers appear to have been adversely affected by the fall in the franc.
HIDES AND LLATHLR.    Hide and calf skin prices fell considerably, largely because of the general situation in the U.S.A.    Turnover in most sections of the leather industry was still restricted;    the Shoe and Leather Fair opened in an atmosphere of uncertainty hut the market remained steady and the position at the close was firm.BUILDING.   Returns received from 142 Local Authorities show that the estimated cost of buildings for which plans were approved was  8.5 m.- slightly less than the figure for October, 1956.      There were decreases of 7.7% for factories and 4.9$ for dwelling houses and an increase of 12.6$ for all other buildings and alterations of existing buildings.RETAIL TRADE.    The money value of retail trade in September was 8.6% higher than in September 1936.    Sales of food and perishables increased in value by 8.3% and of other merchandise 8.2$.    Preliminary returns for October indicate a possibility of a decline.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.    1,109,000 bales of wool were received into store from 1st July to 30th September as compared with 1,006,000 a year before, the quantity sold or shipped being ^95,000 and ^66,000 respectively, wheat and flour shipments from 1st December, 1936 to 26th October were equivalent to 91.6 m bushels as compared with 88.4 m.  bushels a year before.    Butter shipments from 1st July to 30th October were 13,000 tons as compared with 19,400 tons a year before.    Shipments of canned fruit and meat have been considerably larger this season than last.    Imports of merchandise during September amounted to  18.07 m.   (Australian currency) as compared with .S8.83 m.  in September,  1936.
CANADIAN TRADE.    Except for a marked decline in common stock prices and a moderate fall in some commodity prices, economic conditions in September changed little from the satisfactory levels of August.    The index of the physical volume of &quot;business rose slightly.    Though less than in August, exports of copper and nickel and shipments of gold constituted post-war records for September and asbestos exports were greater than in any September since 1920. Newsprint production established an all-time record for September.    Exports of wood pulp, planks and boards, and shingles rose.    The iron and steel industry continued active, although crude steel output decreased.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.    The Union&apos;s external trade has expanded notably this year and last year&apos;s record is expected to be easily eclipsed.    Imports in September were 25.5% greater than in September, 1936.    Exports  (excluding gold) were 66.6% more, due largely to increased shipments of maize. Gold exports were 4.9% more.    The maize and v/ool markets were irregular at the beginning of September but later became firmerINDIAN TRADE.    Imports of merchandise in October  (14,50 lakhs) were 84 lakhs more than in September;    exports  (16,16 lakhs) were 94 lakhs less.    In most parts of India crops were reported to be in fair to good condition.    The estimated acreage of the 1937-38 groundnut crop is considerably greater, and of the rice crop rather less,  than last year.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE. Argentina.  The wheat,  linseed and fruit crops suffered severely from recent frosts.      Wheat prices rose sharply with the prospect of a smaller exportable surplus.    Cattle prices continued extremely high.    Total exports for January/October ( 135 m) v/ere 60% greater than a year before.Uruguay.    The United Kingdom share of total Uruguayan imports has fallen sharply in the first half of this year as
compared with 1936.Chile.      Owing to greatly increased shipments of mining products, total exports for January/August  (704 m. pesos) were nearly double those a year before;    imports increased by 16%.    Copper exports have contracted sharply but still greatly exceed those last year.Colombia. Following the &quot;compensation11 Treaty with Germany in May, Colombian exports to Germany rose from 13.8% of total exports in June to 22.1% in August, while imports from Germany rose from  .7.1% of the total in July to 10% in August.Brazil. The Brazilian Government&apos;s coffee policy is now one of open competition in the world market, the export tax having been reduced by 75%.    United Kingdom exports to Brazil during January/September were  5.2 m. as compared with  3.4 m. a year before.    The increase was largely due to heavy shipments of railway carriages.
