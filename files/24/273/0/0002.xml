HOURS OF WORK IN COAL MINES. MINEWORKERS1   FEDERATION&apos;S CLAIM FOR LEGISLATION. Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines.I recently met the Executive Committee of the Mineworkers&apos; Federation, who had asked the Prime Minister to receive a deputation and had been referred,  in the first instance at any rate,  to  the Mines Department.They explained that their desire to see the Prime Minister was the result of their feeling that various Government &quot;pledges&quot; in regard to the permissible hours of work in coal mines had not been fulfilled.They declined to say exactly what pledges they had in mind, but it appears almost certain that they rely mainly on the report signed by the Chairman of&apos; the Sankey Commission in 1919 (there were several reports by sections of the Commission) and on certain statements made in the House of Commons at different times by leading members of the Conservative and Liberal Parties.    The Sankey Report referred to recommended an immediate reduction in the daily hours from 8 to 7, with a suggestion that,  if the output in the future reached a satisfactory level,  they should be further reduced to 5. This recommendation was acted upon,  and the seven-hour day provided for, by legislation in 1919.      But the report was made,  and the legislation passed,  during the period of office of the Coalition Government,  and can scarcely    be used as an argument eighteen years later against a different Government.In 1926,  the Conservative Government found it necessary to extend the maximum period to 3 hours a day,  in order to avoid what were  considered to be unreasonably large reductions in wages in most of the coal mining districts.    As a result of this legislation,  the hours of work were increased to 8 per day in most of the districts,  although agreements were.-1-
made in Nottinghamshire and North Derby and Yorkshire on the &quot;basis of a 7-g--hour day.     In Northumberland and Durham,  in the case of coal hewers only, the 7-g-hour day applied.It must be admitted that this legislation was stated at the time to be a temporary measure, and the Act was in fact limited in terms to a period of five years.      But before the expiration of the five years, a Labour Government was in office, pledged in advance to restore the seven-hour day.      They found, however, that such, restoration would necessarily&apos; involve either insuperable wages difficulties, or such an increase in costs as would seriously affect trade,  especially&apos;&apos; in the case of exports, and lead to a considerable increase in unemployment in the industry.     Accordingly, by the Coal I lines Act,  1930, the daily hours were reduced only to 7-g- for the period (about six months) which the 1926 Act had still to run.      This was represented at the time as being an instalment on account.     But when the 1925 Act expired, in July 1931,  it was still found impracticable, for the same reasons,  to return to the seven-hour day,  and, by the Coal Mines Act,  1931,  the 7^-hour day was  continued   for a further period of twelve months.      This Act, however,  included a provision under which, speaking generally, wages were to be maintained at their existing level for the same period.     This, of course, v/as an entirely new departure in industrial legislation.By the following summer,  the National Government was in office,  and when the 1931 Act expired in July, 1932, a further Act was passed which omitted the wages provision but extended the 7-g- hour day until the coming into force of an International Convention dealing with the hours of work of coal miners. Although the wages provision v/as dropped in this Act,  the Government obtained undertakings from the colliery owners in the various districts that general reductions in wages would not be sought in the ensuing twelve months - and these undertakings were
carried out.    The disappearance of this statutory wages provision has ever since been one of the grievances of the miners who claim that they were thereby deprived of a most effective weapon with which to fight the colliery owners on the question of hours of workoThe objection of the miners to the Act was, and is, twofold:(l)  that it omitted the wages provision;(2) that it extended the 7^-hour day without fixing a definite period within which hours of work must be    reconsideredoIt is necessary at this point to refer to the draft International Convention just mentionedo    It was negotiated during the period of office of the last Labour Government, the negotiations covering the period January 1930-June 1931*    In the form in which it was adopted in Geneva in 1931 it was not suitable in matters of detail for application in this country, and after several discussions between the European Governments mainly interested in coal mining, it was revised at Geneva in the summer of 1935, in a manner which more than met the British Government&apos;s desires..    The policy of the National Government towards this Convention was announced early in 1932 by the then Secretary for Mines (Mr0 Isaac Foot) and has been re-stated many times since - that when the Convention had been suitably revised we would ratify it at the same time as the other six principal coal producing countries of EuropecOf these countries, Germany is no longer a member of the League of Nations or of the International Labour Organisation,, Holland is opposed to the Convention in its present form. Poland appears favourable to ratificatioiio    Prance has passed a 40-hour week Law for coal mining, but has recently
authorised exceptions, which largely discount the law, Belgium has also introduced - at any rate in theory - a shorter working week.Holland and Belgium are publicly committed to a refusal to ratify the Convention unless the other countries do so simultaneously, and it is known that Germany is not prepared to discuss the question of ratification even outside the International Labour Office machinery.It is probable that in connection with this Convention the Mineworkers&apos; Federation will make a further claim in regard to &quot;pledges&quot; given in the House of Commons by those who were afterwards members of the National Government.      In 1951, after the adoption of the Convention, Mr. Ramsay MacLonald, Mr. Baldwin and Sir Herbert Samuel all spoke favourably of the proposal to reduce hours by international action.    This does not in any way conflict with the policy followed since the spring of 1932, but the miners say that for the last six years the Government&apos;s policy has been to shelve the Convention. The truth is that until it was revised we were not prepared to ratify it, and by the time it was revised Germany had left the International Labour Organisation.The position to-day is further complicated by the fact that there have been discussions in Geneva in 1935 and 1936 on a 40-hour week for coal miners.  The British Government took no part in the detailed discussion in either year, and no real progress was made.    A further meeting is being called by the International Labour Organisation for April 1938 to discuss the question of shorter hours in the coal mining industry, as well as wages and conditions of service.The demand  of   the Mineworkers&apos; Federation at the present time is for a statutory reduction of hours in this country, irrespective of what may or may not be done internationally.
When asked about possible wages repercussions, they said that if a demand for a reduction of wages is made by the colliery owners as a result of a statutory reduction of the working day they will deal -with that themselves as an industrial question.      There is little doubt, however,  that if and when the question arose they would call for assistance from the Government,  invoking the provision in regard to wages in the Act of 1931 referred to above.The basic   objections to a statutory reduction of hours of work to-day - in the absence of international acceptance of a simultaneous reduction all round - are the same as  in 1932.; It is true that to-day the home market is satisfactory, but the same cannot be said of the export trade.     Although employment nas improved and earnings have risen,  there have been and still are, movements in the districts for higher wages.     A statutory reduction of hours would necessarily mean either a demand by the colliery owners for a reduction in wages or a rise in costs of production v;hich would affect the demand for coal and lead to further unemployment.I suggest that I should &quot;be authorised to reply to the Mineworkers&apos; Federation in the following terms:-(l)    that the policy of the Government in regard to the 1931-35 Convention is unchanged - we will ratify when the other six principal coal producing countries of Europe are prepared to do so simultaneously, (2)    that there is to be a tripartite conference in Geneva in April next, at whicn the whole question, including the wages aspect, can be discussed between Governments, colliery owners and miners.      It would be foolish to try to prejudge the outcome of this discussion. (3)    that if they wisr. to do anything to reduce hours of work on a n-tional basis, without waiting for
the results of international action, the proper course is to discuss the question in the first place with representatives of the colliery owners. This would, I think, he in conformity -with the generalpolicy of the Minister of Labour, with whom I have already discussed the problem.H.C.Mines Department,11th November, 1937,
