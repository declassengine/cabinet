THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken to q R E n-r ensure the secrecy of this document.p.  255  (57)o COPY HO.CABINET.THE SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.At a Meeting on Thursday9 18th November/ the Committee of Imperial Defence Jaad before them a telegram from Sir Miles Lampson (No.607 dated 2nd November, 1937) drawing attention to the grave preoccupation of Nahas Pasha, on the state of preparedness to resist attack on Egypt (C.I.D. Paper No. 1369-B Appendix I).2. During the discussion of this subject the attentionof the Committee was drawn to a fresh telegram from Sir Miles Lampson (No,635 of the 12th November)  containing detailed suggestions for the despatch of considerable reinforcements and armaments which he submitted were absolute minima to ensure the safety of Egypt (Appendix II)ra3. From the discussion at the Committee of ImperialDefence it emerged that the question had to be considered from three separate points of view-(l)    What is necessary to meet the risks of any present threat to Egypt:(2)    What is necessary to maintain our prestige in Egypt and the Near East:(3)    Vtfhat is necessary from the political point ofview in Egypt to re-establish confidence in our determination and ability to ensure the safety of Egypt.-1-
4. So far as any immediate threat to Egypt is concerned the Committee were reassured &quot;by a Report received from the Industrial Intelligence Centre to the effect that Italy is almost entirely dependent upon imports of liquid fuel; that for financial reasons stocks have not been replenished and are below the level necessary in the interest of national defence;    and that &quot;all available evidence regarding stocks of this essential war store tends to refute any suggestion of the immediate likelihood of Italy engaging in a war involving large expenditure of liquid fuel.&quot;5. As an interim measure therefore the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs has been asked to draft a Telegram to Sir Miles Lampson, based partly on the above-quoted Report and partly on other material contained in the Reports of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee which should enable the High Commissioner to relieve the immediate anxieties of the Egyptian Government.6, In addition,  in order to provide material for adecision by the Cabinet the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have been asked:-(i)    Irrespective of the probability or otherwise of an Italian threat to Egypt in the near future, to consider and report on the precise measures which it would be possible to take to meet the demands summarised in Sir Miles Lampson1s telegram No, 635 of the 12th November,  irrespective,  in the first instance, of any question either of their reactions on our position vis-a-vis Germany, or of their being liable &quot;to&quot; be construed by the Italians as provocative.(ii)    To indicate the effect which the adoption of each of the measures in question would have on our position vis-a-vis Germany.It is hoped that their Report may be available for consideration by the Cabinet at the same time as this Memorandum,;
7. There is, however, another matter relevant to thedecision, which I was asked to bring before the Cabinet. The despatch of reinforcements to the Mediterranean is at the present time subject to the follow!ag two conditions(i)    &quot;That priority in defensive preparationsin Europe should be given to the provisionof a deterrent to aggression by Germany.....&quot;(Cabinet 30 (37), Conclusion 5 - July 14th, 1937):(ii)    That nothing should be done which couldarouse Italian suspicions or be construed as provocative, the object being to avoid spectacular movements which might start a series of movements and counter-movements by the two nations (Cabinet 40 (37), Con-clusion 6(c)),8. The decision of the Cabinet on what is to be sentto Egypt will, I assume, take into account the first of the above conditions and the Chiefs of Staff have accordingly been asked in the second part of their Terms of Reference to indicate the effect on our position vis-^-vis Germany of any measures feasible in Egypt.     There is, so far as I am aware, no difference of opinion that the first priority in the provision of our defence requirements must be given to the security of the United Kingdom against attack by Germany.9. The second of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 7,however, has been questioned and some of my colleagues on the Committee of Imperial Defence who have special responsibilities and knowledge  concarning the Near East, and Arab and Moslem opinions in particular, have asked that the Cabinet should re-consider the condition that no action should be taken &quot;which c^uld arouse Italian suspicions? or be construed as provocative&quot;.-3-
h 9 &apos;1 010.       The history of this decision is as follows.At their Fourth Meeting, on July 23rd,  the Defence Plans(Policy) Com ittee were considering the question of relations with Italy, including certain steps suggestedby the Chief of the Naval Staff for improving our strategic position in the Mediterranean,     The PrimeMinister was about to see Count Gran&amp;i in order todiscuss the desire of Signor Mussolini for better relationswith this country, and in these circumstances he thoughtthat &quot;at any rate until he had seen Count Grandi we should do nothing which could arouse Italian suspicions or beconstrued as provocative&quot;.    A decision was taken to this effect.11.       The matter came up again on the 3rd November this time at the Cabinet in connection with the consideration of reports by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the situation in theMediterranean and Middle East (C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B), whenthe following decision was taken:-&quot;That the passage in the Report of the Chiefs of Staff -which states that any steps of a military character which could be taken at the present time must be limited by the condition &apos;First that they must not be liable -:-o be con-strued by the Italian Government as provocative&apos;, must be construed in accordance with the Prime Minister1s remark at the Fourth Meeting of the Defence Plans (Policy) Committee on the 23rd July where he emphasised the importance of doing &quot;nothing which could arouse Italian suspicions or be construed as provocative.1    The object was to avoid spectacular movements which might start a series of movements and counter-movements by the two nations.&quot; (Cabinet 40 (37), Conclusion 6(c)).12.       In support of the proposal to remove this condition it was urged at the Committee of Imperial Defence that the security of our position in Egypt ought, not ta depend upon no varying an element as our relations with Italy. That country
does not hesitate before talcing military measures that might be construed as provocative and there is no reason why we should do so, Italy is constantly assailing our position in the Wear and Middle East with continuous and bitter propaganda.      This is undermining our pdsition and prestige, and in order to re-establish it positive action is necessary whether it is provocative to Italy or not.     Broadly that is the argument in favour of cancelling the condition,13. On the other side it must be recalled that upto 1935 our defence requirements were governed by the assumption that expenditure need not be incurred on measures of defence required to provide against attack by Italy.      That was an immense alleviation both in the task of re-equipment and in the burden of Imperial Defence.14. Perhaps in conclusion I may offer a few words from my own point of view.     As Minister for Go-ordination of Defence I conceive that my first object is to secure this country, which is the heart of the Empire, against the gravest danger which threatens it, namely, attack by Germany.      This can only be accomplished by providing such forces as will furnish at the same time a deterrent to war and a safeguard if it should occur. This is bound to take some time even in the most favourable circumstances.      In the meantime any drain on our forces to the Mediterranean or elsewhere can only be made at the cost of weakening us at the decisive point and dislocating the training and organisation of our expanding forces.     Prom my point of view, therefore, the ideal would be a restoration of relations with Italy
to the position that existed before 19350      If this is impossible just now, as may well be the case, the next best would be a gradual approach to better relations during which we should exercise great patience and tolerance and refuse to be drawn into controversy by the antics of Dictators or the gibes of a foreign Presst Even if we cannot see our way towards securing permanent relations of a satisfactory kind with Italy, I suggest that we should never lose sight of the e-ital importance of gaining time for the completion of our re-armament. For, although it is going to be difficult in any circumstances however favourable without exhausting our financial strength, to provide adequately for the defence of our interests in the Mediterranean in a major war in which Italy is numbered among our enemies, we shall in due course be able steadily to improve our position, while Italy,  if I read the signs aright, may before long be going downhill,15. I hope, therefore, that the decision as to theretention or otherwise of the &quot;no provocation&quot; decision will be taken with these considerations in mind.      In the meantime I am not without hope that the Chiefs of Staff Report may enable the Cabinet to take decisions that will, without undue provocation, do something to improve the situation in Egypt and enable Sir Miles Lampson to convince the Egyptian Government that we are taking the defence of their country seriously.16o I append a copy of the draft Minutes of theCommittee of Imperial Defence (Appendix III)  in addition to the documents referred to above.(Intld.)

SECRET.1369-B.APPENDIX I.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.DEFENCE OF EGYPT. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1364-B.)Note by the Secretary.THE accompanying telegraphic correspondence between the Foreign Office and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt is circulated for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY.2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, November 15, 1937.ENCLOSURE No. 1.Copy of a telegram from Sir Miles Lampson to the Foreign Office, No. 607, dated november 2, 1937.I SAW Prime Minister on my return this morning.2. His Excellency at once launched into a long and elaborate [group omitted] of his fears regarding Italian aims. His Government had refused to accept Signor Pirini and had been absolutely right in so doing, for they knew Italian activity in Egypt continued in full force. He next alluded to Italian reinforcements in Libya, which had been fully reported to him by brother of Hamed-el-Bassel, who had just travelled back to Egypt through that area and seen things there with his own eyes, especially at Derna and Tobruk. Marshal Balbo had stated to the latter that their reinforcements were not directed against Egypt, but had added that &quot; Italy would have to live if Red Sea were closed to her,&quot; and had authorised this remark being passed on to Nahas. Latter could only regard it as veiled threat to Egypt.3. His Excellency showed grave preoccupation as regards state of pre-paredness to resist attack on Egypt. He had already spoken to General Officer Commanding and British authorities secretly about this, and as a result had got Council of Ministers to authorise &quot;necessary credits.&quot; Matter had, of course,, been treated as one of the utmost secrecy. But his Excellency showed doubt whether we in Great Britain were taking the matter sufficiently seriously. Point was that, whilst avoiding anything that looked provocative, everything possible must be well done in advance to ensure preparedness. He had absolutely no faith in any assurances given by Signor Mussolini, and must state frankly that he believed Italian aggression was sooner or later inevitable.4. I told his Excellency that I knew question of Egyptian defence was prominent in the minds of [? His Majesty&apos;s Government], and it was largely on that account that I had returned earlier than originally contemplated. I naturally[16147]&apos;
had not yet had time to go into the matter or to consult General Officer Commanding or Air Officer Commanding, but he could rely upon my doing so as soon as possible. Incidentally, one point which had occurred to me was that number of British troops was now limited by treaty. It would clearly be a very delicate matter to invoke &quot; international emergency,&quot; and I was sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be more than hesitant to do so. His Excellency assured me that was entirely unnecessary. &quot;We had his fullest authority to take any measures for defence of Egypt we might judge necessary without treaty clause.5. I thanked his Excellency and expressed the hope that his apprehensions might prove exaggerated. I knew, for instance, that His Majesty&apos;s Government still hoped that some friendly adjustment of relations with Italy might prove possible and that every effort to that end was tjeing made. His Excellency agreed that that was the path of obvious wisdom, but he is clearly convinced that trouble with Italy is inevitable sooner or later and reaffirmed his extreme anxiety regarding adequacy of defence measures in Egypt.6. I propose to report on this later, when I have had time to consider the matter more fully.ENCLOSURE No. 2.Copy of a telegram from the Foreign Office to Sir Miles Lampson, No. 514, dated november 9, 1937.YOUR telegram No. 607 of 2nd November : Defence of Egypt, paragraph 4.I congratulate your Excellency on eliciting from Nahas Pasha the assurance that His Majesty&apos;s Government may take any measures they think necessary for the defence of Egypt without invoking the provision in article 7 of the treaty regarding an apprehended international emergency.2. In connexion with this assurance, however, your Excellency should bear in mind that His Majesty&apos;s Government hold that by a strict interpretation of the treaty the forces of His Majesty need not be limited to the numbers specified in the treaty until the withdrawal to the Canal Zone has taken place (see article 8 and annex to article 8, paragraphs 1, 8, 18 and 19, and Egyptian Department^ letter to the Chancery No. J 8471/2/16 of 14th November, 1936). His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to offend Egyptian susceptibilities or arouse suspicion by maintenance in or despatch to Egypt in ordinary circumstances pending the withdrawal to the Canal of troops in excess of eventual treaty limits. But they do not wish to give away any right to maintain or send troops in excess of those limits which they still possess. In any further discussions, therefore, you should be careful not to allow Nahas Pasha to make erroneous assumptions on this point. The matter is important because of the possibility of Nahas Pasha being succeeded by a less amenable Prime Minister. It is important also in case his Excellency or his eventual successor were at any moment to take a less serious view of the necessities of the international situation than that taken at the time by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who might, nevertheless, not wish to invoke the international emergency provision. I rely on your Excellency to warn me in good time of any such development of the Prime Ministers opinion, so that steps might be taken to avoid the creation of undesirable friction through any measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government might eventually be taking on the strength of Nahas Pasha&apos;s assurance.
APPENDIX II.MOST SECRET.COPY OP A TELEGRAM (NO. 655)  DATED 12TH NOVEMBER,  1957,  RECEIVED PROM HIS MAJESTY&apos; S -AIiBA.3 SAPOR IN CAIRO TO THE SECRETARY 0&quot;&apos; STATE FOR FOREIGN Al-TAIRS.My despatch 1257 of 3rd November (by bag November 6th) contained detailed comment on combined defence scheme prepared &quot;by heads of services.      It emphasised that recommendations in scheme were to be regarded as minima.      It was written only -three days after my return to Egypt and I have since become aware that recommenda-tions were minima in a different sense from that which I had at first supposed,  i,e., they were based not so much on what heads of services believed was necessary for defence of Jjgypt if that problem were considered by itself but what was believed to be feasible in the light of preoccupations of His Majesty1s Government in other regions.      I conceive it my duty, however, to submit my views solely from Egyptian angle, leaving it to His Majesty&apos;s Government to judge comparative merits of requirements here and elsewhere.2. It is unnecessary for me to dwell on strategic importance of Egypt to ourselves.     But apart from this there is one primary and outstanding consideration which I must emphasise with all the force at my command, namely, the complete confidence still placed - although it is diminishing in unofficial circles - in our ability to implement our treaty obligation to defend Egypt.      It is
IV 1J 0of the first importance that neither Egyptian Government nor the people should have cause to doubt this.3, Before getting down to details there are four other general considerations.(a) Since Abyssinian campaign the balance of force in the Near East from a military point of view has been completely reversed by arrival of Italian reinforcements in Libya and their proved ability to reinforce on a large scale at short notice both their land and air force; while difficulties in reinforcing Egypt after hostilities have commenced have greatly increased,(b) If I understand the position correctly it would be most imprudent to&quot; bank on requisite supplies of material and personnel reaching Egypt intact through Mediterranean during early stages of hostilities.      But to this recognised danger must now be added the danger to transit through the Red Seac      If our recret information just received is correct, approach to red sea through Straits of Bab El Mandeb is already complicated by presenc^.-X3X,It?--lia^---guns.      Our reports indicate that batteries have been installed on Island of Dumeira where channel is barely ten miles wide.      (See correspondence ending with your despatch No,593),,     Naval liaison officer is of opinion that Red Sea itself could be kept open as to surface craft by having at least one light cruiser permanently in Red Sea plus East Indies Squadron based on Aden but that coastal batteries and air attack would, still constitute serious menace,,      I submit this is a highly important aspect that should be considered at once;    apart, from other effects it might hamper arrival of reinforcements from India.-
(c)   A prudent estimate must allow in the light of events in Palestine for veiled hostility if not more (especially if things appear to he going badly) from population of neighbouring Arab states.     This inter alia would complicate alternative of overland transit from Basrah.     Further the existing garrison of Palestine might well need reinforcement in above event.(d)   Absence of an adequate and secure naval base in eastern Mediterranean.     Egyptian co-operation in construction of proposed dock at Alexandria is probable as things stand at present but surely it would be unwise to place complete reliance in time of war upon necessary land facilities,  including labour supply.      I would quote paragraph 12 of your despatch No. 761 of 29th June to the effect that while it is still a grave objection that 11 the only base in Eastern Mediterranean should be in the hands of a fickle Oriental power it must be remembered that considerable British forces will if an emergency arises be available to protect our base at Alexandria from any possible Egyptian acts of sabotage&quot;. But this is definitely not so.     Headsof services report shows only British troops available for Alexandria would be one battalian constituting General-Officer-Commanding&apos;s only reserve which might have to be utilised elsewhere according to situation. I can therefore in no sense guarantee that a situation, might not arise rendering proposed Alexandria dock (apart from absence of proper local defence) useless or unsafe.     And at the best the absence of repair shops, etc.,&apos;would surely reduce its value?      I am aware that it may hardly be within my sphere but I
cannot avoid opinion that it would &quot;be far wiser and safer to revert to Cyprus project and not he dependent in so vital a matter upon the good will of any foreign country whether allied or otherwise.4. As a result of full discussion with General-Officer-Commanding and Air-Officer-Commanding in the light of above considerations I submit absolute minima to which in our opinion effect should immediately he given if we are to be in a position to ensure the safety of Egypt.Land,    (a)    Immediate issue of up-to-date equipment and armament for all units as already asking for especially Hark VI tanks and anti-tank rifles.      (General-Officer-Commanding tells me he has none of the latter at all though ten are being issued to Egyptian Array.) Royal Engineer companies to be raised to war establishment with a ten per cent reserve;    all other units now in Egypt to Colonial establishment,     Completion of reserves of guns, armaments and vehicles and provision of anti-gas equipment and reserve M.T. Company.(b)    reinforcements as follows:-One Anti-aircraft Brigade    (Most Urgent.)One field company R.E.One armoured car unit.One mixed tank battalion.One infantry brigade.including one machine gun battalion with necessary signal and ancillary services.5. To be 100/j safe these troops should form part ofgarrison of Egypt and despite considerable increase in numbers they involve we might be able to get present government to accept their presence without invoking
&quot;apprehended international emergency&quot; clause of Treaty or arguments furnished in your telegram Ho. 514 9th November.     But as you know political situation is at present uncertain, another government might he less accommodating;    moreover there is always possibility of the opposition making political capital.     I therefore recommend that with the exception of anti-aircraft brigade which should come to Egypt at all costs the other units specified above should forthwith be stationed in Palestine with orders that they should stand by to come to Egypt at a moment&apos;s call.6. Air.      m addition to one fighter squadron for defence of Alexandria already asked for in heads of services report, R.A.P., to be at once reinforced by two bomber squadrons equipped with latest long distance bombers.      Replacement of aircraft of squadrons already here by up-to-date aircraft is to be seriously accelerated.     Air-Officer-Commanding informs me that these requirements are the more urgent in view of secret information just received from a reliable source of reinforcement of Italian Air Porce in Libya by twenty aircraft believed to be S81 to form two new bomber groups at a new aerodrome just completed at Pobruk.7. Our discussion has definitely confirmed myanxiety of a successful surprise attack on Mersa Matruh owing to lack of sufficiently early information to ensure prior occupation by British trcops.     We propose trying to meet this by arranging supplies with Egyptian Government for strengthening of light car (frontier administration) patrols on frontier and for installation in western desert of air observation posts the same as in
1935 to be manned at once when judged necessary. Ideal would cleanly   be to station a strong British garrison in Mersa Matruh.      International as well as Egyptian internal politics may well be against this at the moment but I would once more most strongly urge that General-Officer-Commanding be given forthwith unfettered discretion to move British units to Mersa Matruh whenever he judges it necessary.     Otherwise I submit we are running an unwarrantable risk of being caught napping.      (Please see paragraph six of my despatch 1257).8. There is also possibility of a successful Italianattack on Sudan.     Apart from the politico-moral effect both in Egypt and elsewhere I should have thought such an attack would affect the defence of Egypt both as regards possible air attacks from South and occupation of Port Sudan with its consequent menace to commuhication in the Red Sea.      It is true that I am advised that occupation of Khartoum Atbara and Port Sudan from Eritrea presents great military difficulties;    none the less I submit necessity of reinforcing Sudan from India through East Africa or Port Sudan upon outbreak of hostilities should at least be studied.9. Foregoing (with exception of paragraph 8)represents the minimum requirements to ensure defence of Egypt and it is of profound importance that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have in mind that inability to meet them may well entail grave risk in the Near East and inability to discharge obligations assumed under our alliance towards Egypt..     If considerations elsewhere
doare held to override our Egyptian responsibilities, position is obviously very serious;    nor do I see how we can counter the growing feeling restated in parliament this week by Ismail Sidki Pasha, in favour-of an Egyptian treaty of reinsurance with Italy.Please read this telegram in conjunction with my despatch No. 1257 which covers a number of other important points especially the risk of a breakdown of governmental and civilian morale with all its implications if our present inadequate resources are not strengthened.10. Beginning of telegram has been seen and concurred in by General-Officer-Comnianding and Air Officer Commanding.Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No.  635 of 12th November;    repeated to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.
SECRET.APPENDIX III.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 301st Meeting, held on November 18.1937.(3)-SITUATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND MIDDLE EAST:DEFENCE OF EGYPT.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1369-B.)(Previous Reference :  C.I.D. 300th Meeting, Minute 6.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a telegram from Sir Miles Lampson to the Foreign Office (No. 607, dated the 2nd November, 1937) and a reply thereto (Foreign Office telegram No. 514 dated the 9th November, 1937) on the subject on the defence of Egypt.   (C.I.D. Paper No. 1369-B.)THE CHAIRMAN said that, since the receipt of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram of the 2nd November, a further telegram dated the 12th November had been received in which the Ambassador expressed anxiety regarding the security of Egypt from Italian attack, and proposed certain steps which should now be taken to increase our strength in the Middle East. He (the Chairman) had written to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggesting that the points raised by Sir Miles Lampson in his later telegram should be considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, in conjunction with their examination of the Combined Plan which had recently been received from the Local Commanders in the Eastern Mediterranean.LORD CHATFIELD said that the Combined Plan in question had been prepared on the basis of an interim appreciation of the situation in the Mediterranean which the Chiefs of Staff had approved last July. This apprecia-tion, and the Combined Plan which had followed it, dealt with the situation which would arise and the action which should be taken after war had broken out. The observations and proposals now submitted by Sir Miles Lampson on the defence of Egypt dealt with the situation as it existed at the present time, i.e., before the outbreak of war. The Committee would recall that at its 300th Meeting certain measures for restoring our prestige in Egypt had been approved. These measures were limited by the provisos that we should do nothing which coidd be construed as provocative by Italy or seriously weaken the position at home vis-a-vis Germany. In view of this ruling, the Chiefs of Staff could not recommend that any further steps of the nature suggested by the British Ambassador in Cairo should now be taken.Mr. ORMSBY GORE suggested that the time had now come to consider whether the provisos to which Lord Chatfield had referred should be reviewed, and, if necessary, rescinded. The support of the Arab world as a whole would go to the Power which showed the greatest strength. It seemed essential that something should be done to improve our defensive position in Egypt and the Middle East as a balance to the Italian policy of aggression and propaganda in that area. In addition, the provision of docking facilities at Alexandria was an urgent problem and was bound up with the alternative project for establishing a defended base in Cyprus. Whatever might eventually be decided, it seemed important that an improvement in our defensive position in Egypt should be treated as a matter of urgency.[16177a] &apos; b
&apos; THE CHAIRMAN said that it was scarcely possible to separate Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s view of the situation from the long-term appreciation of the situation in the event of war. The Ambassador&apos;s telegram inferred that the precautionary period had.now in fact been reached, and demanded the despatch of reinforce-ments for the immediate defence of Egypt. His proposals were not designed as a demonstration or as a display of British strength in the Mediterranean so much as to safeguard the security of a vital link in the Empire.LORD CHATFIELD observed that in the Report which the Chiefs of Staff had submitted to the Committee at their previous Meeting regarding measures which might be taken to improve our prestige in the Eastern Mediterranean, the over-riding principle governing the Chiefs of Staffs proposals had been that our primary commitment was the defence of the United Kingdom against the possibility of German aggression. Within this framework, and having regard to our existing resources, there was very little in the way of additional military and air equipment which could be spared for the defence of the Middle East. Unless, therefore, the Chiefs of Staff received fresh instructions, they would be unable to propose any material measures for improving the position in Egypt.LORD SWINTON suggested that the problem resolved itself into two considerations. First the inference to be drawn from Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram that the precautionary period had now been reached and that war with Italy was imminent. Secondly, Mr. Ormsby Gore&apos;s suggestion that we should make a demonstration of our power in the Mediterranean and Middle East As regards the first consideration, indications were not lacking that Italy was in fact less ready at the present time for war than she had been a few months ago. For example, a report by the Director of the Industrial Intelligence Centre showed that Italian stocks of oil were extremely low. If this was the case, Italy would be in no shape to contemplate an act of aggression against Egypt with her motorised divisions based in Libya. Moreover, it was understood that Italy was finding great difficulty in the pacification of Abyssinia. As regards the measures which we might take to demonstrate our power in the Middle East, the governing question was whether it was more important to retain all our attenuated forces for the defence of the United Kingdom, or to denude the United Kingdom in an attempt to improve our position in the Mediterranean.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed, but suggested that there was a third point for consideration. Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram gave the impression that the Egyptian authorities had become seriously apprehensive of the imminence of Italian hostility, and that they would be left in the lurch without adequate help from us. It was possible that their anxieties were groundless, but it seemed essential that we should take some steps to reassure them.Mr. DUFF COOPER remarked that it seemed clear that the Ambassador, on his return from the United Kingdom, had sensed an atmosphere of anxiety in Egypt, amounting in the case of certain Egyptian authorities to distrust of Great Britain&apos;s ability to safeguard Egypt. The Cabinet had decided that no ostentatious measures should be taken. It seemed, however, that the time had now come when the more ostentatious measures we could take the better.Mr. EDEN agreed with the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air. While we might have our doubts as to Italy&apos;s preparedness for sudden hostilities, the Egyptian Government could only view the situation from their own stand-point, and the picture presented to them might appear more alarming. Italian .&apos;&apos; bluff propaganda&apos;&apos; had a powerful effect, and the Egyptians were very susceptible to it.   He agreed the time had come to give them some reassurance.Mr. ORMSBY GORE said that Italian propaganda was having its effect not only in Egypt, but also over the whole of the Arab world; unless we could do something to counteract it, our position in the Middle East would slip.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE remarked that a dangerous situation would arise if we despatched strong reinforcements from this country to the Mediterranean. The fact that we had denuded our home fronts would not be lost upon Germany, and might have unfortunate reactions. He enquired what steps the Services could take, if it were ultimately decided to strengthen our position in the Mediterranean.
Mr. DUFF COOPER suggested that we ought to press on with the proposition of a dock at Alexandria and with the provision of A.A. guns for that place.SIR CYRIL DEVERELL said that we could only send anti-aircraft formations to the Mediterranean at the expense of the defence of the United Kingdom. We only had two regular anti-aircraft groups, and these were not up to establishment.Mr. ORMSBY GORE suggested that if we were unable to despatch modern anti-aircraft units to Egypt, would it not be possible to send some old anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, and to organise a force of Egyptians locally to man them.SIR CYRIL DEVERELL said that a certain amount of anti-aircraft training material had already been sent to Egypt.SIR JOHN SIMON remarked that if it was agreed that our main object was to reassure the Egyptian Government, then the actual steps which we could take would not be of great importance, provided a reasonable show of additional strength was made.THE CHAIRMAN said that there appeared no reason why we should not inform the British Ambassador frankly of the true position of the Italian threat, and instruct him to pass the information on to the Egyptian authorities. As a second step, the Chiefs of Staff, when considering the Combined Plan on the defence of Egypt, might suggest what steps could be taken at the present time to improve our position.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed, but suggested that it would be insufficient merely to reassure the Ambassador with words, without meeting in some way his proposals for increasing our military strength.SIR CYRIL DEVERELL remarked that one of Sir Miles Lampsoiks proposals was that additional troops for the defence of Egypt should be stationed in Palestine. This would involve difficulties, to say nothing of the difficulties of maintaining even the existing garrison of Palestine at full strength.LORD SWINTON said that it would be impossible to send additional air squadrons to Egypt without denuding our home strength. The air forces in Egypt were, however, being re-equipped with modern aircraft, and one Wellesley squadron had actually arrived on the station. During the winter two other squadrons in the Middle East would be re-equipped, and it was intended to replace one bomber squadron by a fighter squadron.SIR MAURICE HAN KEY informed the Committee that the Joint Planning Sub-Committee were now engaged upon preparing a Report on the defence of Egypt which could be divided into two parts; he understood that the first would deal with the Combined Plan which had been submitted by the Local Commanders; the second with the question of immediate steps to improve the position. In this latter connection they might be asked to take into consideration the proposals contained in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram of the 12th November.LORD ZETLAND said that our loss of prestige in the Middle East was tending to spread throughout the Arab world and to the Moslems in India. It seemed essential that something should be done to redress the balance. Our hands-were at present tied to some extent by the Cabinet decision that no measures which could be construed as provocative should be taken in the Eastern Mediterranean. The difficulty was that Italy might regard any steps which we might take as provocative. It appeared desirable, therefore, that the Committee should ask the Cabinet for further instructions on this point.THE CHAIRMAN said that the Cabinet decision had been reached to meet the situation obtaining at the time. The German menace had then, and now, remained our principal commitment. If it were the Committee&apos;s opinion that the position in Egypt and the Middle East should now be restored, the Cabinet ,should be placed in possession of all the relevant considerations.Mr. EDEN suggested that the Foreign Office should, in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff, prepare an appreciation of the situation giving the fullest possible information regarding the Italian present unpreparedness for aggression[16177a] b 2
on a large scale, and that this should be despatched by telegram to Sir Miles Lampson as soon as possible. Secondly, he suggested that the Chiefs of Staff should consider whether anything could be done to meet the demands summarised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram of the 12th November, 1937, having regard to the observation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it was important to do something to reassure Egyptian opinion, and to the recommendation of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that, for the sake of our prestige throughout the Arab world, some demonstration of our strength should be made.SIR SAMUEL HOARE observed that the French shared the views that had been expressed as to the improbability of aggressive action by Italy. General Gamelin had said that the recent Italian reinforcement of Libya was prompted by fear.LORD SWINTON thought it essential that the Chiefs of Staff should have perfectly clear instructions. He suggested that they should be asked to report as soon as possible on the precise measures which it would be physically possible to take to meet the demands summarised in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram of the 12th November, irrespective in the first instance of any question either of their reactions on our position vis-a-vis Germany, or of their being liable to be construed by the Italians as provocative.In addition, they should be asked to indicate in their report the effect which the adoption of the measures in question would have on our position vis-a-vis Germany.THE CHAIRMAN agreed with the suggested terms of reference, and expressed the view that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to render the report as soon as possible. He added that it appeared to be the general wish of the Committee that the opinions which had been expressed should be communicated to the Cabinet with a view to a reconsideration of their previous decisions as to the provisos which should be applied to the despatch of reinforcements to Egypt.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested that, from the point of view of the Secretariat, it would be difficult to incorporate all the arguments that had been put forward in formal conclusions. He therefore suggested that they should be presented to the Cabinet in the form of a note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.THE CHAIRMAN expressed agreement with this proposal, and undertook to draft a memorandum in consultation, as necessary, with other Ministers concerned.Mr. ORMSBY GORE, reverting to the question of a dock at Alexandria, asked whether the Committee might be informed of the progress of negotiations.Mr. EDEN said that up to the present discussions had been confined to the position in Egypt itself, but that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram also dealt with the Red Sea and the Soudan. He (Mr. Eden) particularly wished to have the views of the Admiralty as to the menace that had been created by the installation of heavy guns on the island of Dumeira (see paragraph 3 (6) of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram of the 12th November).LORD CHATFIELD said that the Admiralty were very conscious of the threat which Italian aircraft might present to our sea-borne trade in the Red Sea, but the installation of guns at Dumeira did not give cause for serious anxiety. The Naval Commander-in-Chief had looked into the question and had reported that it was unnecessary for ships to go closer than 15 miles to the island. A copy of his telegram to the.Admiralty on this subject had been sent to the Ambassador in Cairo.Mr. HORE-BELISHA remarked that the resources of the army at home were extremely limited. If the situation in Egypt were really critical it would he necessary to call on the Government of India for assistance.
Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a) To take note of the telegram from Sir Miles Lampson to the Foreign Office dated the 2nd November, 1937, and the Foreign Office reply thereto dated the 9th November, 1937 (C.I.D.
