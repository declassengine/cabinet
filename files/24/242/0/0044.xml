Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATE herewith, as I think they may be of interest to my colleagues, copies of two secret communications which I have recently received from General Sir David Campbell, Governor of Malta, on the recent situation in the Island.These are : (1) A letter of the 7th July, enclosing a precis of a commentary on the local situation in June of this year, as expressed in conversation by a responsible non-party Maltese gentleman loyal to the British connection, but by no means a rabid Imperialist.(2) A secret despatch, dated the 7th July, enclosing copy of a petition addressed to the Governor by Professor Calosso, an Italian subject, and Italian Master at St. Edmund&apos;s College, Malta, complaining that his fellow-Italians on the Island have placed him under a formal ostracism on account of objections which he had expressed to certain pro-Italian manifestations in the Island.These reports show how serious and urgent is the question of Italian propaganda.P. C.-L.Downing Street, July 22, 1933.(1)The Palace, Malta,Dear Sir Philip, July 7, 1933.I THINK you will be interested to see the enclosed precis of the views on the present situation in Malta as recently expressed by a well-known and responsible Maltese gentleman, whose name I will give you when I see you.I expect to be in London by the beginning of the week after next, and hope I shall have an early opportunity of discussing Maltese affairs with you.Yours sincerely,DAVID G. M. CAMPBELL.The Right Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, G.B.E., &amp;c,      &amp;c,      &amp;c.(Confidential.)Precis of Commentary on the Situation in Malta in June 1933 as expressed in Conversation by a responsible Non-Party Maltese Gentleman, Loyal to the British Connexion, but by no means a Rabid Imperialist.The conversation arose out of the Maltese gentleman in question mentioning that a certain Englishman in -business in Malta, requiring legal advice, went to[8871]
one of the better-known advocates (naturally a-member :of tne. Nationalist Party) and consulted him. The advocate gave him some: advice/ but&apos; on ithe following day sent the papers in the matter back to the Englishman and made some transparent excuse for not being able to continue to act as his adviser.The point of the incident was that, with only about two exceptions, the legal profession forms a solid ring, or &quot; Camorra,&quot; banded together for the furtherance of the political aims of the Nationalist Party and thus unwilling.to give even legal assistance to Englishmen when these may have cases at issue in the Courts with Maltese.The speaker went on to ask, almost in despair, when the Imperial Authorities were going to become alive to what was going on in Malta under the present regime. The present Ministry, with perhaps one exception, were only interested in matters of political controversy, i.e., the language question and the schools and the furtherance of Italian generally; and administratively they confined their energies to giving jobs to their political supporters and preventing anyone from the other side from obtaining a Government post. Thus, while there were at present eight vacancies in the Civil Service, Ministers were carefully refraining from filling these (this can only be done by public examination), and were ensuring that their friends and supporters should have the jobs by calling the posts &quot;Auxiliary Clerkships &quot; (which can be filled by nomination) and appointing their friends to them. These &quot;Auxiliary Clerkships&quot; carry no pension, only a gratuity; but the speaker, and likewise the general public, had no doubt that, after these nominees had held their posts for a certain number of years and thus acquired something in the nature of vested rights, they would, if the Nationalist Party was still in power, be quietly transferred into the ranks of the permanent Civil Service. He added that both the senior and junior members of the permanent Civil Service were becoming seriously disheartened at the state of affairs and he said that if the inevitable return to Crown Colony Government were deferred for many more years those then responsible for carrying on the administration would find great difficulty in securing competent senior Civil Servants to take charge of Departments. Both the morale and discipline of the Service were becoming demoralized; for example, if the permanent head of a Department had cause to censure a messenger who was a Nationalist, the latter would run straight to the Minister and the head of the Department be instructed to withdraw the censure.The same shameless political favouritism was shown in other directions. Thus the Contract Committee was constantly being overridden by the present Ministry, where the tenders of Constitutionalists had been recommended for acceptance, and the Committee was given to understand that only supporters of the Government were to be considered. Again, quite recently the Traffic Control Board had unanimously appointed on his merits a certain individual, not a Nationalist, to a minor traffic post under them, an appointment within their statutory powers. A letter had been sent to the Traffic Board by the Head of the Ministry and another Minister instructing them to cancel the appointment and to appoint a Nationalist instead. Thereupon the Chairman of the Traffic Board had sent in his resignation.The speaker said that there was a wide but inarticulate wish for immediate return to Crown Colony Government, felt by almost all except the lawyers and politicians and those whose interests depended on these. But this inarticulate sentiment would never be voiced aloud, because the present Government and the professional classes were powerful, had at their command not only the machinery of Government with its spoils but also a scurrilous and unscrupulous press, and would make life intolerable for any who had the hardihood to advocate the abolition of Self-Government.Asked how he thought this powerful Nationalist and anti-British ring could be broken down, the speaker said that it could be done, and could be done quickly and effectively, but only in the following way : (a) By a prompt return to Crown Colony Government;(b) by the radical reform, after Crown Colony Government had been resumed,of the University, in which the present spirit animating the bulk of the professional classes was generated and nurtured;(c) by the suppression of Italian propaganda, both from outside and insideMalta; ......
Secret (3). Malta, The Palace, Valletta,Sir, July 7, 1933.I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy of a petition* addressed to me by Professor Calosso, an Italian subject and Italian master at St. Edward&apos;s College, in which he complains that his fellow Italians in Malta have placed him under a formal ostracism and asks that there may be assured to him &quot; that liberty to which both my wife and I are entitled, whilst living as law-abiding citizens in a free Malta under British rule.&quot;From what I have heard from other sources, I have no reason to doubt the -accuracy of Professor Calosso&apos;s statements. I understand, moreover, that his wife is a sister of a certain Captain Ettore Laiolo, who was killed in the War after having, as I am informed, made a considerable reputation for himself and won the rarely bestowed Italian Gold Medal for Military Valour.I am afraid there is no doubt that life in Malta is, by direction of the Heads of the several Italian organizations here, made extremely unpleasant for any Italians who, even if not anti-Fascists, do not associate themselves actively with the Italian propagandist activities in these Islands. It is difficult to see how the situation can be remedied as regards Signor Calosso; at the same time, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may be interested to learn of this example of Italian political persecution in British territory.2. Signor Calosso, in handing his petition personally to the Lieutenarit-Governor, referred to his amazement at the increase in what he called Italian Irredentism in Malta in the course of the last year. He mentioned that it was very noticeable how, in the course of the last few months, people in cafes in the public squares, not only Italians, but Maltese, would express objection if others rose and took off their hats, at the end of a band performance, when the band played &quot; God Save the King.&quot; He mentioned also that there were already a thousand children, mostly Maltese, receiving instruction in and being influenced by the Italian educational establishments in Malta. This statement is borne out by the attached extractt from the Fascist illustrated weekly II Legionario of the 29th April last.3. I take this opportunity to enclose a cutting! from the Times of Malta of the 6th July concerning an exchange of courtesies and gifts of a tendencious character between the Universities of Malta and Rome.4. I may also mention that I have just received the annual request from the Principal of the Umberto I for the usual &quot; laissez-passer &quot; for the Maltese students of that Institution who are being taken, at Italian expense, for an annual holiday of five weeks in Italy. In 1931 the number of Maltese students: thus taken was 11; in 1932 it was 25; on the present occasion it is 44.I am given to understand that on the occasion of these holidays every possible comfort and entertainment is provided for the children, regardless of expense, with the natural result that they return to Malta full of enthusiasm: for -everything Italian. .  iI have, &amp;c.D.

1 Enclosure I; \Palazzo Spinola,Tour Excellency, St. Julian&apos;s Bay, May 19, 1933.I FEEL it my duty to submit to your Excellency &apos;s consideration certain facts of recent occurrences in Malta. -    -In April last, the Italian theatrical company directed by the Sicilian actor, Febo Mari, held nine performances at the royal Opera House, Valletta. On the opening night the said Manager, Signor Febo Mari, appeared on the stage before the performance, and in a speech full of political allusions and innuendos, conveyed to the audience greetings from his motherland. I was present at the Theatre, and although irritated and mortified, said nothing. A few nights later, on the 21st April, it was announced that in addition to the evening performance, some verses would be recited. Using as a pretext an Italian political commemora-tion of recent innovation, the above-mentioned actor launched into another political discourse, mentioning in particular the &apos;&apos; Empire of Mother Rome &apos;&apos; and the links binding it to Malta; delivering, in fact, a speech on behalf of Italian Irredentism.On this occasion I felt it my duty to suggest from my box &quot;passiamo alle poesie &quot; (&quot;let us get down to the poetry &quot;) but three words, extremely polite, and devoid of political significance; words, moreover, which were no more than the simple expression of the right conceded to any spectator who had paid for his ticket to hear a comedy performed and some verses recited, and who was not inclined to listen to a political speech into the bargain.I wish to submit these facts because they have provided an occasion for further political intrigue which aims at undermining that liberty to which both my wife and I are entitled, whilst living as law-abiding citizens in a free Malta under British rule.Following my polite protest, Professor Franceschini, Director of the recently opened &quot;Liceo Umberto Primo,&quot; thought fit to put me under the so-called &apos;&apos; ban do &apos;&apos; or ban a word which in English can only be rendered by &apos;&apos; outlawry &apos;&apos;  barring me from the social life of Malta. Thus the said Professor Franceschini held a meeting at a local Italian political Club to inform the members that it was forbidden to approach me in any way; he later summoned to the &quot;Liceo Umberto Primo&quot; certain Italians and Maltese who were in the habit of associating with me, and warned them that they were not to do so any longer, under threat of such vendettas as he was in a position to apply, either directly or indirectly. Certain of these persons are prepared to give detailed testimony, and I am sure it would not be difficult to obtain this from the others.Following these incidents, some days later, on the 23rd April, Professor Stanghellini, the Director of the &quot; Istituto di Cultural Italiana,&quot; in Strada Zaccaria, Valletta another institution of recent foundation wrote to me as a result of this &quot;ban,&quot; deploring my protest at the Theatre and informing me that I had been expelled from this Institute. Surely these illegal actions are contrary to public order, and represent an encroachment on the Imperial power not only by individuals but by recognized foreign institutions in Malta.The &quot; ban &quot; in question is a mediaeval instrument of Criminal Law which had fallen into disuse. No private citizen can legally take this right upon himself, much less can a foreigner or a foreign institution. Professor Stanghellini and the &apos;&apos; Liceo Umberto Primo &apos;&apos; have therefore in this connexion supplanted the British Authorities in the Island, taking to themselves the functions of the Soverign Power and of the legal guardians of the peace in the Island. Moreover, this is not the first time such an action has been taken. The late Commendatore Giuseppe Donati was similarly victimised by this &apos;&apos; bando at the hands of the predecessor of Professor Franceschini. It would, indeed, seem that such treatment is reserved for those Italians who show themselves disinclined to accept in Malta any ideas of Italian Irredentism.Finally, as I am a stranger to your Excellency, I feel I must add that I am in possession of a regular Italian passport, as well as a written document in which the Italian authorities gratuitously bestow upon me their recognition of my good citizenship.I beg, &amp;c..        ; - (Signed) UMBERTO CALOSSO.o
