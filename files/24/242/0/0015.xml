[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Blajesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933. SECRET. Copy No..CP. 165 (33).CABINET.Future Arrangements for Work in connection with the Persian Gulf at present dealt with by the Colonial Office.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1. I have read with interest the Memorandum circulated by Sir John Simon, as OP. 156 (33) on the future arrangements for the work in connection with the Persian Gulf at present dealt with by the Colonial Office. I agree to his suggestion that, in view of the divergence of opinion between us, the Cabinet should appoint either, a small committee or one of its members to study this question and make recommenda-tions for a solution. But I think it desirable at the same time to place on record the reasons for which I consider it desirable that the work in question should be dealt with in future through the India Office rather than through the Foreign Office.The Problem.2. I need not go into the past history of this case; it is fully covered by the-Colonial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum. In actual practice the work done by the Cplonial Office in connection with these Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms (which, though technically independent, are under British protection) consists of the handling qf pil questions, the political affairs of Koweit, and, at infrequent intervals, incidents arising in other sheikhdoms such as Bahrein which affect our relations with Ibn Saud. But the-question now before us is, in fact, less extensive than that description might suggest and it is necessary to see it in its true perspective: What is, in fact, now in issue-is not who shall in future be finally responsible for the matters referred to above. What is in issue is merely the channel of correspondence, and whether the Political Resident shall in future address His Majesty&apos;s Government through the India Office or through the Foreign Office on those matters on which in the past he addressed them through the Colonial Office. No question of responsibility or of control is affected. Under the arrangements made by the Cabinet in 1928 all matters on which the Resident has hitherto addressed His Majesty&apos;s Government through the Colonial Office are considered jointly by the Departments concerned, including the India Office, and. in case of difference of opinion go in the first instance to the Standing Middle East Official Committee, on which the India Office is represented, and, if necessary, to a Standing Committee of Ministers. The decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government reached in the light of this inter-departmental discussion are communicated to the Resident through the Colonial Office. There is no question of control resting with -any individual Department.The Administrative Aspect.3. I do not in these circumstances propose to deal with the arguments set out in the earlier part of the Memorandum circulated by Sir John Simon (though I cannot accept the suggestion that the Foreign Office is the Department best suited to balance the international against the Imperial and Arab aspects of questions such as oil and air). Those arguments would be relevant if we.were dealing with a proposal to transfer the control of the matters under discussion from one Department to another. But I -repeat that there is no question of any transfer.of control or any alteration of existing arrangements in connection with it. All that is in issue is the channel of correspondence, and all that I want to secure is that in view.of the importance of this area from the.Imperial standpoint the administrative machine shall be in a position to work with the minimum of friction or difficultj&apos;-.4. The India Office and the Government of India are at present responsible for the internal affairs of the Persian Giilf Sheikhdoms. There is no proposal that they should cease so to be responsible (incidentally they find not only the men, but almost all the money required in this area).   The India Office is.in addition the channel of
communication with the Resident on questions affecting the Arab air route. The Resident is already in the closest contact with both the Government of India and the India Office on internal questions. It is peculiarly difficult in this area to draw a fixed line between what is purely internal and what is also external, or to decide at what point an affair of internal administration with minor outside reactions is likely to develop into a major political question. It is certain, however, that all questions of external policy that arise in the sheikhdoms must have also an interval aspect, and it is both logical, and desirable, if we are to avoid the risk that the interests of our proteges may be overlooked, that on such questions the local British authority should in the first instance address the Department which is responsible for those interests. Moreover, can it be satisfactory that our chief local representative should have to decide at each stage in handling a case whether its external aspect has now become so prominent that he must address the Colonial Office and not the India Office, or so tmimportant as to justify his adopting the converse precedure ? That is the present position ; it is one which successive Residents have found most difficult and the risks of which are patent. It would be perpetuated were the Foreign Office now to replace the Colonial Office as the channel of communication.In dealing with this area my object throughout, both as Secretary of State for Air and as Secretary of State for India, has been to concentrate responsibility so far as possible ; to diminish the number of channels of correspondence of the Resident; and to reduce the number of authorities whom he may be required to address. The desire of the Colonial Office in present circumstances to be relieved of Persian Gulf work affords an excellent opportunity for removing what has for long been an anomalous dualism and for concentrating the Residents correspondence with His Majesty&apos;s Government into one channel. This can be secured only if the channel of correspondence is with the India Office. To replace the Colonial Office by the Foreign Office would merely he to perpetuate an existing unsatisfactory state of things, for the Resident will still have to address the India Office on internal questions, and those internal questions are, moreover, inextricably entangled with external questions. The fact that the officer who doubles the roles of Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Consul-General at Bushire already corresponds direct with the Foreign Office is irrelevant for the present purpose. He so corresponds (on routine matters) solely in his latter capacity, viz. as a Consul-Geueral in Persia, and this correspondence has nothing to do with his really important political work on the Arab littoral.5. The arguments on administrative grounds for the substitution of the India Office for the Colonial Office as the channel of correspondence between the Persian Gulf and His Majesty&apos;s Government are in these circumstances in my view decisive. I may add that this is the view of the Resident himself, with whom the subject was informally discussed during his recent visit to this country and who is in the best position to know where the shoe pinches. It is also that of the Government of India, who have had many years&apos; experience of the situation.The Political Aspect.6. So much for the administrative arguments in favour of a single channel of correspondence. Are there, in fact, any political objections? The Memorandum circulated by the Foreign Secretary suggests that it is politically preferable that the Foreign Office should replace the Colonial Office because he fears that, with India&apos;s constitutional advance, we shall be pressed to Indianise the Gulf posts, that a larger effective measure of control over that area will be transferred to the Indian Legis-lature, and that the substitution now of the India Office for the Colonial Office will render the ultimate transfer of the Gulf work (internal as well as external) to the complete and immediate control of His Majesty&apos;s Government more difficult.7. I recognise the importance of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s points. But I can assure my colleagues without hesitation that no question of Indianisation of personnel in this area is likely to arise as a result of the White Paper proposals. Nor is there any risk under those proposals of a transfer of control of India&apos;s external affairs (including the internal administration of those Arab, sheikhdoms) to the Indian&apos; Legislature. Any such transfer must be a thing of the definitely remote future. Until it takes place (and it can take place only with the specific approval of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and Parliament) India&apos;s external affairs will remain a reserved subject, the Governor-General being subject to the control of Parliament and the directions of the Secretary of State.   If aud when the stage is reached1 in Indian constitutional
^development at which foreign affairs are transferred to the control of an Indian-Legislature, then clearly the Gulf work as a whole, including administration, must pass in its entirety to a Department of His Majesty&apos;s Government. But that stage is very far ahead, and I feel no hesitation in saying that the possibility is one which we need not consider in the present connection.S. Nor, in my judgment, is acceptance of the present proposal likely to make the ultimate transfer of the Gulf work more difficult. That work can best and most easily be transferred en bloc when the time comes, and at this stage it is only necessary to ensure that control of polic3r in the Gulf in the matters now under discussion shall continue to rest, as under my proposal it will continue to rest, not with the Government of India, but with the interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I wish to emphasise that we are not discussing .a transfer of control from any Department of the Home Government to the Government of India. What we are considering is the substitution for the Colonial Office, as a channel of corre-spoudence, of the India Office (and not the GoArernment of India, whose position in the whole question would remain precisely as at present, and who, under the -arrangements I propose, would have neither more nor less control or interest than at the moment).Conclusion.9. In my considered opinion, there is, on administrative grounds, a conclusive case for a single channel of correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and therefore for making the India Office the channel for such part of this correspondence as has hitherto been conducted by the Colonial Office, as well as for the remainder. The existing Persian Gulf procedure, approved by the Cabinet in 1928, would continue to be followed in. arriving at decisions on the matters dealt with in the correspondence. Full control would remain in the hands of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the position would in no way be affected by any of the forthcoming constitutional changes in India. I agree, however, as I have indicated above, that in view of the divergence of opinion between the Foreign Secretary and myself the Cabinet should appoint either a small committee -or one of its members to study the question and make recommendations for a solution.S.
