S E C R E T. CP.  179 (33)This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Copy No. .. .     . . .CABINET.PI UAL REPORT OP THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON LOTTERIES AND BETTING.Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.As my colleagues will be aware,  the Einal Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries and Betting was published early last month, and I attach a memorandum, analysing the reception accorded to the Report by the Press.The recommendations of the Commission cover a &quot;very wide field and some of the issues raised are very controversial.     The questions of policy upon which decisions will be required cannot be considered from a purely Departmental point of view, and it will be necessary for the Cabinet,  or a Committee of the Cabinet,  to give close study to the Report, for the purpose of formulating a national policy.In view of the many urgent preoccupations of my colleagues,  I have not hitherto thought it right to bring the Commissions Report before the Cabinet for consideration, but the approaching adjournment for the Summer Recess and the dispersal of Ministers compel me at this stage to seek the advice of my colleagues.I have made it clear,  in reply to Questions addressed to me in the House of Commons,  that the Government have not had time to give careful study and attention to the Report of the Royal Commission, and that,  in view of the congested state of public business, no undertaking could be given that it would be possible to introduce legislation in the near future to deal with any part of the wide field covered by the Commission&apos;e recommendations.     The House will, however,  expect to receive, soon after Parliament
12th July,  1933reassembles in the Autumn,  some statement of the Government&apos;s intentions, and I think that the Cabinet ought, during the interval,   to come to a decision on the question whether it is proposed to introduce legislation on the subjects covered by the Commissions Report and,  if so, what form that legislation should take.What I suggest therefore is that the Cabinet should set up a representative Committee who should be charged with the duty of studying the Commissions Report with a view to submitting recommendations to the Cabinet in the Autumn.     If the Cabinet approve this course, it would not be necessary for the Committee to hold any meetings until after the Summer Recess, but the appointment of a Committee now would prevent Parliament and the country from thinking that the Royal Commissions Report has been pigeon-holed, while the Ministers appointed as members of the Committee might,  it is hoped,  find time to give some preliminary study to the Report during the Summer Recess.Meanwhile the Report is being carefully studied in the Home Office and steps are being taken to ascertain the views of Chief Officers of Police on certain practical questions affecting police administration which are suggested by the detailed recommendations of the Royal Commission.      These views, framed in the light of the practical knowledge and experience gained by the police in the course of enforcing the existing law relating to lotteries and betting,  ought to be of great value and assistance to the Government.j&quot;.

REPORT ofTHE ROYAL COMMISSION on LOTTERIES AND BETTING.----0O0----PRESS COMMENTS.There was general agreement that the angle from which the Commission approached the subject - namely, that gambling amojjig private individuals should not be interfered with,  and that organised facilities should only be restricted or prohibited if the social consequences were serious - was sound.     The detailed recommendations made by the Commission received general approval from most quarters, the Times describing them as &quot;a coherent series of discriminating replies to a series of presented difficulties.&quot;The Times,  some days after the Report appeared, returned to the subject and said that tho Report had been welcomed by responsible opinion and that the Government must act on it.      The Yorkshire Post appealed strongly to the Government to act on the recommendations, and similar sentiments were expressed by the Birmingham Post, Northern Daily Telegraph and other papers.      The Manchester Guardian of 23rd June criticised the Government for not promising to introduce legislation on the lines of the Commissions recommendations in the near future.      Some papers  (Daily Telegraph, Western Mail) said they hoped the Government would take no action on the Report, and others (Scotsman, Morning Post) thought the Government would refuse to face such an awkward subj ect .On the Course Betting.The restrictions proposed in the case of on-the-
course betting facilities.gained practically, universal acceptance in the Press.     In the Yorkshire Post of 9th June and in other papers the view was expressed that the restrictions were moderate and no more than the situation called for.     The Liverpool Post of 9th June said that the principle of local control of on-the-course betting facilities would commend itself to Parliament, and the Nottingham Guardian of 9th June said that the Government would probably find it desirable to proceed at once to secure the better regulation of dog racing on the lines suggested in the Report.The only protesting voice was the Daily Telegraph which considered the recommendations arbitrary and partial.Off, the Course Betting.There is agreement that something must be done to bring the disregard of the Street Betting Act to an end. In regard to the proposal that postal cash betting and the deposit of bets at a bookmaker&apos;s office shall be legalised,  the pervading note in the Press is that only experience will show whether those recommendations will make the Street Betting Act enforceable and whether they will lead to a spread in the betting habit.      The Times of 9th June recommends that effect be given to the Commissions proposals.     The Manchester Guardian of the same date is somewhat fearful of a spread of the betting habit.      Truth considers that the legalisation of postal cash betting will lead to more betting and it criticises the representatives of the Churches for having accepted the proposed relaxation of the lav/.The proposed registration of bookmakers has secured general approval in the Press on the ground that it will do much to prevent undesirable practices. No objection to registration appears to have been raised in the papers
associated with the churches  (e.g.  the British Weekly of 15 th June) . :/Betting Inducements and Betting by Juveniles.The Commissions proposals under those heads have, been supported by all sections of the Press.Racecourse Betting Control Board.*  The Times of 9th and 17th June dissents from the Commission&apos;s recommendation that the present arrangements by which the Board taps off-the-course betting through a subsidiary company should be brought to an end,   on the ground that the bookmaker should not have a monopoly of off-the-course betting.Elsewhere,  the Commissions proposals in this connection have not been the subject of definite comment.Lotteries.The Times of 9th June  considers that the Commissions  conclusions and recommendations regarding lotteries are marked by good, sense and proportion,  and the Times of 17th June remarks that no one who has dissented from the Commissions condemnation of large lotteries has made any attempt to answer the convincing set of reasons which led the Commission to their conclusions.The Daily Express of 9th June says that large lotteries have the effect of a poisonous drug&apos; in man&apos;s blood and that the Commission reached the right conclusion. The Daily Mail of the same date says that there is a demand for lotteries for hospitals which must be granted.Regarding the measures proposed against the sale of tickets in lotteries promoted abroad,  the Manchester Guardian of 9th June says that if they were acted upon the fortunes of the Irish sweep would be enormously depreciated.
The Morning. Post and Evening Standard of 10th June urge public acceptance of the Commission&apos;s proposals for suppressing the sale of Irish sweep tickets.     Most newspapers appear to welcome the proposed prohibition of the publication of the results of draws.     Some papers are sceptical whether the restrictions would effectively reduce the sale of Irish sweep tickets - for instance, the Glasgow Herald of 9th June speaks of the danger of a demoralising underground traffic, and the Sunday Times of 11th June says the result would be to intensify the present difficulties.Newspaper Competitions.All the more responsible nev/spapers welcome the restrictions proposed on newspaper competitions - e.g. the Yorkshire Post of 9th June gives the proposals &quot;whole-hearted support&quot; .     The News Chronicle of 9th June offers to accept them at once without waiting for legislation, if other papers will do likewise.      The Daily Express of 9th June agrees with the Commission that competitions for large prizes are undesirable.The Daily Mail and Daily Herald offer no comment for or against the Commissions proposals.Gaming.The proposals under this head have not attracted any attention,   except the proposed legalisation of Y/hist drives (subject to certain conditions) which is approved.
