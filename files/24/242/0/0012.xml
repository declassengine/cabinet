Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.SECRET &apos; \-.-,:&apos;:\&apos;: \. Copy No.    ,38C.P. 162(33).CABINET.NEW GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN WHITEHALL and edinburgh.Method of Selection of Architects.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.AT the request of the Cabinet Committee on Trade and Employment I prepared particulars of various building schemes, the suitability of which for inclusion in an expanded Government building programme was determined by the following conditions :- (a) The scheme must be justified by needs and on merits, and not  IS EL CclSO&quot;of relief work.(b) Due regard should be had to considerations such as (i) the net saving effected as compared with the rentals atpresent paid; (ii) any Government pledges to carry out the scheme.Among these schemes were the following : (A) Whitehall Gardens and Montagu House building.(B) Edinburgh Government Offices.(A) This scheme was urged on the following grounds : (1) The admitted necessity for housing the Air Ministry in one building (instead of in five, as at present), and in close proximity to the other Defence Services.(2) The demand for headquarters accommodation in Whitehall to relieve existing congestion and over-crowding in other buildings in the area.(3) The desirability of reducing high rental charges for unsuitable accom-modation in the Central London(4) The desirability of removing the present unsightly temporary hutments in the neighbourhood of Montagu House.This scheme has the outstanding advantage that, whilst providing modern office accommodation to meet the needs of such headquarters Departments as the Air Ministry, Board of Trade, Ministries of Labour, Agriculture and Transport, the ultimate standing charges for interest and sinking fund will amount to less than the rentals at present being paid for unsatisfactory accommodation. Further, at the expiration of the redemption charge period, the Government will remain in possession of a freehold site and building.(B) This scheme was urged strongly by the Secretary of State for Scotland on the grounds that the expansion of Government business since the War and the difficulties of finding adequate accommodation have led to a situation in which staffs are working in many cases under deplorable conditions, and the[8758]
efficiency of the increasingly complex administration of Scottish affairs is seriously impaired. I also understand that there is a strong case on political grounds for centralising in a single building the various departmental offices scattered throughout Edinburgh. I know that there is now a strong local demand for this scheme in Scotland. The scheme ranks with the Whitehall Gardens scheme as regards urgency, but, owing partly to the very low rents at present paid, does not stand upon its own legs financially, as the standing charges for interest and sinking fund would exceed, to some extent, the present rentals. This case has in the past been complicated by considerations of site difficulties and architectural treatment, which are now under discussion with the Scottish Fine Art Commission. I am now hopeful that these negotiations will be concluded at an early date;As regards the two schemes above mentioned, the Cabinet Committee approved a proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed with the necessary preliminaries, and to report to the Cabinet when the preliminary investigations and negotiations shall have been completed. The stage has been reached when Architects must be appointed, and I now desire to submit to the Cabinet my proposals as to the method of selection to be adopted. I will take Whitehall first.There are four methods of selection : (1) Employment of an official architect.(2) Open competition.(3) Limited competition.(4) Selection from a, panel without competition.(1) Employment of an official architect.I think that it will be generally agreed that, in spite of the undoubted advantages, financial and other, which accrue from placing as a general rule the provision of new Government buildings in the hands of my Department from start to finish, the outstanding national importance of the Whitehall site, and the great public interest which this building will arouse, renders advisable the appointment in this case of an architect in private practice. In fact, the Prime Minister, in course of correspondence with the Royal Institute of British Architects in July 1930, gave an undertaking, on the advice of my predecessor, that the design of the new Whitehall buildings would be entrusted to an architect in private practice.(2) Open competition.The method of open competition has often been advocated in the profession, mainly on the ground that only by this means can the finest architectural skill be made available. This argument overlooks the fact, however, that many architects of first rank who have established their position refrain from competing; in open competitions, and it is, therefore, not the case that by such competition one can draw upon the whole architectural genius of the times. It is said that an open competition gives the opportunity for an unknown genius to emerge, and this might, by a lucky fluke, be so; but the chances are not, in my opinion, adequate to turn the scale, particularly in view of the fact that success in design provides no guarantee of the knowledge and experience essential to the successful completion of a building scheme of the magnitude and importance of the Whitehall case. The highest claim that can be made for this method is that it enables a selection to be made from such designs as may be submitted. The experience of my Department in the matter of open competitions has been singularly unfortunate; in no case in the last 100 years has the winning design ever been carried out.For these reasons I have come to the conclusion that open competition should not be resorted to. ,(3) Limited competition.A competition limited to a number of selected and experienced architects of proved capacity who have agreed, to compete does at least secure a high standard of; competence in both; design and execution, but in the three cases in which this method has been adopted in the past by my Department it was found necessary
-ssStr:::,^:-;^42      ito abandon the selected design and to entrust the selected: architect with the preparation of a fresh scheme.   In any form of competition, limited or otherwise, ,there can be no certainty that the winning design will be the ultimate solution of the problem without radical alteration, and the cost involved in the payment of substantial premiums to all, the selected competitors in a limited; competition would, in my opinion, be out of proportion to the value of this alternative&apos;, as. a means of selecting the architect to whom the commission should be entrusted,. -I cannot accordingly recommend a limited competition.: ;;     .(4) Selection from a panel without competition. ...I have come to the conclusion that the best results are likely to be achieved not by making a selection from a number of designs submitted either in open or in limited competition, but by the direct choice of an architect. This is the practice that has been adopted in every case but one in which an architect in private practice has been, appointed by my predecessors during the last thirty-five years.I would accordingly propose to ask the President of the Royal Institute of British Architects to submit a panel of the names of eight or ten architects who would be prepared to accept a commission for the building in question. It may be necessary to attach a condition that the nominations should be restricted to architects not more than 55 years of age, in view of the length of time which the buildings will in any case take to complete and of the possibility that the scheme may be held in suspense for a period if financial circumstances have not improved by the time the sketch plans have received approval. These names would go before a Selection Committee consisting of, say The First Commissioner of Works (Chairman),The Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission for England and Wales,The Chief Architect of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, The President of the Royal Institute of British Architects, The President of the Royal Academy,who would, after a careful examination of their work and records, including drawings and photographs of buildings, select the architect considered to be the most suitable. In this way, while ensuring, as far as may be, that the work will be entrusted to competent hands, the Government will be sharing with other judges who should command public confidence the somewhat difficult responsi-bility of selecting the architect. The architects appointment would then be made on terms to be settled with the Treasury in the usual way and subject to precise conditions regarding the control of design, structure and finance. I need hardly stress the need for this control, both as regards the ultimate suitability of the building for its purpose and as regards finance.When the architect is appointed, he will be furnished with the schedules of requirements on which to base his designs and with tentative maximum limits of cost. It will also be made a condition of his appointment that no final decision will be come to as to whether or when the scheme will be proceeded with until sketch plans, elevations and detailed estimates of cost have been received and approved. Before seeking final authority to carry out the schemes, I think it desirable that the Fine Art Commission should again be consulted on the actual designs submitted by the architect.It is, of course, difficult to say how long the preparation of plans and estimates by the architect will take, but, in view of the complexity of some of the problems involved, I do not imagine that it will be possible to expect them in less than twelve to eighteen months from the date of actually appointing the architect.It should be mentioned that, as a result of an open competition in 1914, Mr. E. Vincent Harris was entrusted with a commission for a building for the Board of Trade on the Whitehall Gardens portion of the site. The scheme was abandoned early in the War and Mr. Harris was paid the compensation to which he was entitled under his agreement. In view of this, and of the enlarged scale of the scheme, I consider that there is no obligation towards Mr. Flarris in the matter, and that I am free to proceed in the way suggested/As regards the centrah Government building scheme in Edinburgh, it had been the intention of my immediate predecessors that the design&apos; and execution of the work should be entrusted to the Chief Architect of the Office of Works;
and in August 1929 the Prime Minister authorised an intimation to this effect being sent in his name to the Royal Institute of British Architects from the Department. My colleagues will be aware how hotly since then this scheme has been canvassed in Edinburgh, and of the intensity of the feelings which have been aroused. Calton Hill is a pivotal site, and, having regard to this and to the civic and national feeling which, has been evoked in regard to it, I have&quot;c&apos;om &apos;&quot;tb&quot;&apos; the conclusion that, as in the case of Whitehall, the balance of advantage lies in -entrusting the new buildings there to an architect in private practice, and in associating the Scottish authorities themselves in the choice of the architect. I am assured by the Secretary of State for Scotland that if this is done it will materially ease the present negotiations over the site problem with the Scottish Royal Fine Art Commission, and go far to reconcile Edinburgh opinion towards the carrying out of the scheme. It will, moreover, have the effect of deflecting from the Government later on much of the criticism on points of style which may be directed against any new building. I therefore propose that the procedure which I have suggested in the case of Whitehall be followed, mutatis mutandis, in Edinburgh, the separate panel for selecting the architect for the Scottish buildings to be a matter of agreement between the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself.Having regard to the architectural and national importance of these Government building schemes, I desire to have the approval of my colleagues for the course which I propose.W. O. G.His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works, &amp;c, June 28, 1933.o
