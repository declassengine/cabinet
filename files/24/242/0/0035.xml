Rome.2. M. Massigli, Who&apos;requested me to come and see him to-day in-order to make me a communication,i informed me&apos;that the conversations^ had. been:x)f..a very friendly-character, and that they had been similar with one exception: to those held between- the&quot; French Ministers and Lord&apos; Londonderry, Mr. i Eden .and Mr. Norman1 Davis on the 8th &apos;June. &apos; On. the formen occasion M. Daladier: had said that he must consult his1 Cabinet on the proposition that: France shouldiagree in &quot;a convention, to- be concluded now, that- she would undertake to reduce her armaments at the end of the period of trial, provided the trial iiad. been proved satisfactory. In the interval M. Daladier had consulted his Cabinet,-and had been able to tell Mr. Henderson that France was prepared to bind herself in the way then proposed by the British Ministers and Mr. Norman Davis.3. M. Massigli handed me a copy of a memorandum which had been prepared&quot;for-Mr. &quot;Henderson. He asked me to explain to you that it was a confidential document which should not be communicated; to any other foreign Government, and use should not be made of it in any public statement. He: had, however, communicated a copy to&apos;the: United States Embassy. Copies of the memorandum are enclosed herein.4. M. Massigli then went on to say that Mr. Henderson was proposing to proceed from&apos;Rome to Berlin and from-Berlin to Prague, where he intended to see M.&apos;Benes as&apos;the Secretary-General of the Conference, and then pass through Paris again ori his way back to London, which he expected to reach&apos;by. the end of next week. It was then his intention to let matters rest until Septerhber. &apos;M. Massigli, however, had intimated to-Mr. Henderson that the French Govern-ment would prefer not to leave things&apos; for so long, but would like to hold further direct Anglo-French conversations between now and the end of July.6964   [8855] b
Enclosure.Informal Memorandum given to Mr. Henderson after the Conversations of Jidy 11, 1933, with MM. Daladier and Paul-Boncour.(Translation.) (Confidential.)THE problem of disarmament is dominated at the present moment by a question of fact: towards what end are the German Government striving 1Chancellor Hitler, in his speech of the 17th May, and the German representatives at Geneva have maintained that the Reich had no desire to increase its armaments. At the same moment, however, Germany is seen to be developing a programme of rearmament, on the one hand in the domain of effectives, and on the other in the domain of material, and particularly in the question of aviation. Whatever explanation one may endeavour to give to these facts, it nevertheless remains true that in a number of countries the Governments and public opinion are watching with legitimate anxiety the events which are taking place beyond the Rhine. At the moment when it is a question of making possible the conclusion of a convention which should involve for certain Powers an important reduction in their military status and an appreciable modification, to their detriment, of the balance of forces, it is natural that these Powers feel more imperiously than ever the necessity for certain precautions.I.In order to facilitate the solution of the problem of equality of rights, the French Government put forward a proposal which the British draft later made its own, namely, the standardisation of the types of army in- Continental Europe on the basis of short-term service with limited effectives. In doing so, the French Government was well aware that its proposal entailed certain sacrifices for France.(a) France was renouncing for the future the advantages which the strict observance of the system set up by the Treaties of Peace was designed to ensure for her in respect of the possession of trained reserves and this at the very moment when the application of the system under the treaties might have begun to take its full effect in Germany as a result of the categories of men who had fought in the war passing the age limit.(&amp;) France was accepting, so far as the forces intended for the immediate defence of her metropolitan territory were concerned, parity with Germany and Italy in effectives, in length of service and in cadres.Mr, Henderson, however, did not appear pleased with this idea. Nevertheless, M. Massigli asked me to inform you that the French Government were themselves very much in favour of pressing on with the negotiations by means of such direct Anglo-French conversations. M. Massigli would be available until the end of July, but in August he would be on leave. He thought that there could be a useful exchange of views between the two countries before that date. He under-stood, moreover, that the United States Government would not have any objection to such bilateral conversations, and that Mr. Norman Davis would not be returning to Europe until September.5. M. Massigli said, in conclusion, that he was afraid Mr. Henderson had not been entirely satisfied with the contents of the French memorandum, but that he had told him frankly that it was not the last word of France, but that any concessions, if made now, would be lost for the final bargain at the conference.I have, &amp;c.R. H. CAMPBELL.P.S. Questions of naval disarmament and aviation were not discussed at the meeting between Mr. Henderson and the French Ministers.R. H. C.
(c) The application of this proposal entailed besides an important reduction in daily average effectives for all French forces as a whole, as well for the forces in the home country, and also in the length of service, of those called to serve in the forces in the home country.II.In the present state of Europe and in view of the anxieties to which allusion has been made above, one is justified in taking the necessary precautions to ensure that the modification of the present relative strength of armaments in Continental Europe in a sense favourable to Germany shall not endanger the security of France and that of other countries.The experience of the discussions at Geneva seems to prove that it is not possible at present to obtain in the realm of mutual assistance those collective guarantees which would have made easier for the different Governments a reduction in their military status. That is, however, in no way a reason for not proceeding with the realisation in the political sphere of the progress which the work accomplished at Geneva permits us to anticipate (non-recourse to force, definition of the aggressor, &amp;c, . . . ), and which could, moreover, be realised, on a universal scale, by less strict formulas than those which it is desirable, if possible, to apply in Continental Europe.But in any case it will be indispensable to acquire the certainty that the new regime which it is now a question of setting up in the matter of armaments will be more faithfully observed than that which the treaties of peace had created.The technical work, and especially that of the Committee on Effectives, has thrown into the limelight the real difficulties of the problem and the possibilities which a State acting in bad faith would have for getting round the undertakings in regard to limitation which might result from the future convention. For example, in the question of effectives it is important to avoid the limitations being got round by a development of pre-military instruction and of instruction outside the army or in police of a military character; nor must it be possible for Germany to add a new conscript army to her professional army instead of substituting the former for the latter. It is no less important that the increase in German effectives should not be accompanied by rearmament in material.At a politically critical hour France, who accepts here and now the reduction of her effectives, would not be able, in the very interests of peace, to accept also an immediate reduction in her material before the experiment of a strict super-vision of the limitation of armaments has made it certain that the transformation of armies on a defensive model is being loyally executed.III.It results from the preceding observations that in the execution of the measures of limitation and reduction of armaments a chronology and a process should be established.(A) During a first period of four years, the so-called trial period, the mechanism of the convention will be perfected; at the same time, the armaments race will be stopped and the first operations of armaments reduction will be effected.Among the measures to be taken in this period, the application of which will be subject to regular and permanent control, the following may be quoted : (1) The change, following a. definite annual process, from the present situation in the matter of effectives and duration of service, to the situation prescribed by the convention (some discussion will be necessary with the British delegation in regard to certain modifications in the figures proposed by them); during this same period, all para-military instruction will be suppressed in accordance with the conclusions of the Effectives Committee. Pre-military instruction will be subject to strict regulation under conditions which should ensure equivalent advantages to all States.It should be remembered that the French delegation has already on several occasions defined its position as regards the question of trained reserves, the question of the limit which should be placed on the period of reserve, and the question of a distinct regime for overseas forces.[8855] . - b 2
(2) As regards material, and under reserve, eventually, of special dispositions for all immobile artillery, whether coastal or fortress : (a) For those States whose land armaments are not subject to any limitation : (i) cessation of all manufacture of artillery above 155 calibre, and of all construction of tanks over a tonnage limit to be fixed; (ii) storage on national territory, but under control of the League of Nations, of the most powerful war material.(&amp;) Those States bound by the military clauses of the peace treaties will continue to observe the qualitative limitation of material to which they are now subject.(3) The annual manufacture of material authorised by the convention will only be carried out in certain prescribed factories (private or State) submitted to international control and within the limit of the contingent fixed for each State.(4) Controlled publicity of armaments expenditure with a view to the realisation of the technical conditions necessary for the enforcement of a limitation of this expenditure in the second phase of the application of the convention.(5) Perfection of the control which, should in particular allow for local, regular and periodic inspection (at least once a year).(B) For the second period of four years, and on condition that the control organisation continues to function with the&apos; improvements suggested by experience, the convention should provide for the following measures : (1) Completion and, if necessary, maintenance of the execution of the measures provided for in the first period.(2) Enforcement of limitation of expenditure.(3) At the beginning of this second period and if the Permanent Disarmament Commission has established by a majority vote under conditions which should be laid down that the progressive execution and the control of the limitation and reduction provided for in the first period have been satisfactorily carried out, the following material should be handed over to the League of Nations, which can either conserve it and put it at the disposal of a State which may be attacked (and this solution is preferred by the French delegation) or order its partial or total destruction, and which in any case will become responsible therefor : (a) All artillery above 220-mm. calibre which shall not have been transformedinto immobile coastal or fortress artillery.(b) All tanks above the authorised tonnage.IV.The convention should contain dispositions designed to deal with any violation of engagements undertaken.With a view to realising a new stage in the reduction of armaments, the convention should provide for the ulterior conclusion of a second convention at an appropriate time, arid under conditions preventing, in accordance with article 8 of the pact, the signatories of the first convention from resuming their liberty of action oh its expiration.July 12, 1933.
Minute by Mr. Eden.THE French attitude, as indicated in their memorandum of the 12th. July, is discouraging. In. several respects it is less satisfactory than were the conversations in Paris in which Lord Londonderry and I participated with M. Daladier, M. Paul-Boncour and Mr. Norman Davis on the 8th June. Their demand for a &quot; trial period &quot; is intelligible and, in the circumstances, probably justifiable. But there is little prospect of inducing Germany to accept this idea except as part of a Convention which itself provides for as much disarmament as is contemplated in the United Kingdom Draft. If the proposals of the memorandum represented the final French attitude, there would indeed be scant hope of realising a Disarmament Convention.There are, however, three points to note : (1) The French have frequently hinted to us privately that they would find difficulty in negotiating with Mr. Henderson and making concessions to him (see my memorandum of 3rd July).(2) M. Massigli was at pains to let Mr. Henderson know that this was not France&apos;s &quot; last word.&quot;(3) The French Government are anxious to continue conversations with us before September. This last point raises the question as to what reply we should return to this French request for further conversations. Would such conversations serve any useful purpose ? Under what conditions could they be pursued ? It is of course impossible to forecast whether in further conversations the French Government would modify their attitude. If, however, no such conversations take place, and the French were to produce proposals such as these in September, then the Germans might well leave the Conference finally, with the advantage of at least the appearance of justification f^r their action. It might be argued that an effort should be made to avert any danger of such an outcome of eighteen months of endeavour.Moreover, since the French have themselves suggested the conversations, it might be as well not to give them an excuse for saying at a later date that they had given us an opportunity for an exchange of views which we had rejected.On the other hand, we have assured Mr. Henderson that we would not carry on conversations with the French behind his back, and we shall in any event have to await his return probably at the end of this week and consult him before returning any definite reply to Paris. Such a consultation should take place immediately on his return, as time is short if conversations are to take place this month. If they are to take place, Mr. Henderson should, I suppose, te asked to preside at them. This arrangement would not appeal to the French, but I do not suppose that they would raise any insuperable objection to it.We should in any conversations have to make it clear to the French that their proposals have, in our view, no chance of forming the basis of a convention, since they are certain to be regarded by Germany as unacceptable. We need not therefore at present go into the question of supervision, since the degree of disarmament we are here offered by the French Government in exchange for the degree of supervision they desire is altogether inadequate. If the French would increase their offer to any satisfactory extent so that, for instance, it accorded generally with the proposals in the Disarmament Convention itself, we should then be in a position to seek to press acceptance on Berlin with the assistance, if possible, of the Italian Government.The Cabinet have decided that the first essential is a Franco-German settle-ment. If they consider that that could be effected without our intervention, we could leave things alone; but these French proposals make it abundantly clear that there would then be no such settlement. If, however, it is thought that we have a duty in promoting a Franco-German settlement, I submit that we ought not to refuse the offer which the French make to us to discuss the matter further with a view to finding an acceptable ground for compromise, unless, of course, Mr. Henderson, when consulted, were to show himself opposed to such conversations.A.
