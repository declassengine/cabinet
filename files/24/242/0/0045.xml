Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I accept the Report of the Committee /C .P.190 (33 T/. AS to one feature of the Report, however,,  I am not satisfied that the course proposed is the best or even intrinsically a good one. Since the feature is of very great importance,  I think, that I should let my colleagues know briefly the reasons foi  my opinion.The feature in question is the establishment, amongst those in need of assistance,  of a separate class of industrial or able-bodied, unemployed, who are to receive special treatment.I do not thim that this distinction can be justified by any difference between the claims of this class and other recipients of assistance;    and I think that it will work badly in practice.The proposal is to give preferential treatment to the able-bodied.     Those against whom the preference will be exercised will be -Widows and orphans (and deserted women);The temporarily sick;The disabled (including ex-service men);The small &quot;own-employer&quot;  (shopkeeper/ on evil days;The aged over 65.These are the chief classes (other than the able-bodied) in receipt of outdoor relief.      There are but few others.These classes deserve no less well of society than the able-bodied.      Indeed they deserve greater consideration, because their misfortunes are greater.      We shall be discriminating against undeserved misfortune and misery.
t) ti pIt Yfill be remembered that it will no longer be possible o support a claim to preferential treatment, for the class to be idministered by the Commission, on the grounds of their previous ^employment insurance record.   We shall be admitting to that class arge numbers who have never been in unemployment Insurance.Are we not missing a matchless opportunity to do a big thing iy putting our system of assistance on a more humane and more reasonable iasls?   -    an opportunity too of relieving local authorities of a mrden, the burden of maintaining good standards of administration, that s bscorning too heavy for them.The administrative objections to the proposed plan are in my iew serious.    I will state only the more definite.There will in each area be two independent authorities dminlstering the needs test and fixing standards of out-door relief, he Commission^ standards and practice will have a national extension, he extension of those of the local authorities will be local only. : belieV3 that that will /badly.     Each authority will be affected by he other, and the result will be to weaken the administration of both.There will be many cases on the borderline between the idministration of the Commission and that of the local authorities, here will be much passing backward and forward of cases from the one o tho other.    Such lack of/clear frontier must generate friction.This lack of a clear-cut frontier will make it impossible to estimate with any certainty the financial; burdens of the Commission md the local authorities respectively.   (The difficulty thus intro-luced into the negotiations   on finance with the local authorities 111 be formidable.rIn another region of ideas,    I think that the loparation of the able-bodied unemployed ilnto a class.
baaed, as it seems to me, upon an arbitrary distinction, will make it much easier for any future government, that wants to do so, to abolish the needs test for that class, as a step in the direction of &quot;work or maintenance&quot;.In favour of the plan proposed by the Committee^ i&amp;sre is the contention that publio opinion will not tolerate the assimilation of the able-bodied unemployed to the recipients of outdoor relief under the poor law.     The contention is no doubt entitled to great weight.     In my view it can be met by transferring the present recipients of outdoor relief (i.e. the widows, disabled, and other classes referred to above) from the local authorities to the Commission, but to be administered by the Commission in a department separate from that administering the able-bodied, and uni er separate rules*     This would avoid the assimilation that it is desired to avoid, whilst at the same time avoiding unjustifiable discrimination against the unfortunate. It would also avoid the administrative disadvantages of the division of authority, and give a clear definition to the spheres of the Commission and the local authorities.(Intld.) E.H.Y.22.vii.33.
