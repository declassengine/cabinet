Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   42CP. 152 (33).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATY PROPOSALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.1 HAVE carefully studied the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence circulated as CP. 124 (33).&quot;While I fully recognise that the report deals exclusively with the military aspect of the treaty proposals, I cannot fail to notice that, in its opposition to the policy of the transfer of our forces to the Canal Zone, it goes considerably beyond both the collective opinions of previous Chiefs of Staff as summarised on p. 5 of the Foreign Office paper of the 12th April (circulated as CP. 109 (33)), and in particular that of the last Chief of the Imperial General Staff (circulated as C.I.D. Paper A.E.T. 8 of the 13th December, 1932).In recording their opinion that &quot; the essential dependability of Egypt can only be assured by the location in peace of British troops in the vicinity of Cairo &quot; (paragraph 7), I am bound to say that the Chiefs of Staff appear to me to press the military aspects of the situation vital as the protection of the Canal and of our air communications is and must remain to a degree which is neither necessary nor practicable. In effect, the hypothesis that effective as opposed to potential military control over the whole of Egypt, even in time of peace, is essential to the safeguarding of these communications, is to condemn Egypt, a country the independence of which we proclaimed eleven years ago, to continue indefinitely as a military protectorate of Great Britain.Taking the report in detail I have the following comments to offer : Paragraph 4. While it is no doubt true that the presence of our troops in the cities affords in the last resort a guarantee for the suppression of riots and disturbances, it must not be forgotten that their presence is at the same time, to a considerable and not wholly unjustifiable extent, an excuse for such disturbances. It is a commonplace of present-day Egyptian politics to denounce the party in power as &quot; upheld by British bayonets.&quot;The passage with reference to the importance of intelligence appears to overlook the potentialities of the British Military Mission which is to be attached to the Egyptian army.Paragraph 5. I do not think it is really relevant to compare the Egypt of to-day with the Egypt of 1881, at the time of the Arabi revolt. To do so is to ignore the progress which the country has made over a period of half a century,, including the Cromerian regime. The Arabi revolt was, in its origins at least, a national movement against Turkish influence based upon Turkish suzerainty over Egypt: this latter factor has now disappeared, and the nearest approach to it to-day is, incidentally, our own claim under present conditions to reserve a very much restricted but still important number of posts in the Egyptian service for our nationals. The Egypt of to-day is at once more stable internally and bound by more numerous and important ties, commercial and otherwise, to the outside world than was the case in 1881. Self-government and parliamentary institutions, while the extent to which they are established need not be exaggerated, do exl^tv and provide some additional guarantee of stability.6911   [8695]
Paragraph 7.-If I. may make one definite criticism of the report, it is the: completeness with which it ignores the terms of the proposed treaty of alliance. While it is permissible, although I am not convinced necessary, to postulate a,lack of good faith on the Egyptian side, we are surely bound to bear in mind the extent to which the terms of the alliance confer upon us the right to take what may conceivably be withheld. In this paragraph the Chiefs of Staff demand &quot; depth &quot; to the east and to the west of the Canal. The draft treaty gives it them not only in war but &apos;&apos; in the event of imminent menace of war or of serious disturbance within the territories under the sovereignty or authority of His Majesty the King and Emperor or territories adjacent thereto, or in the event of a threat to His Majesty&apos;s essential communications.&quot; In all these eventualities, of which we are to be the judge, freedom of movement in Egypt and the full use of Egyptian ports, communications, &amp;c, is secured to us, and any attempt to withhold these things by the Egyptians would be a breach of treaty obligation. It is indeed hard to see why this should not be enough.Paragraph 8. I think that the example of a possible danger from Italy, cited in this paragraph, again arises from a certain lack of appreciation of what would be the position under the treaty. Were Italy to attempt to intervene in a post-treaty Egypt in the circumstances postulated, she would be attacking a country allied by treaty with us, and which, postulating the &apos;&apos; serious commitments else-where,&quot; would be on a war footing under the terms of that alliance. Moreover, the undertaking to be given by the King of Egypt in the treaty, under which His Majesty accepts responsibility for the,lives and property of foreigners, would give us the right (while our presence, even on the Canal, would give us the power) to take action long before there could be any question of Italian intervention.Paragraph 9. It is satisfactory that the question of water supply does not offer insuperable difficulties to the transfer to the Canal Zone. This seems to meet the point raised by the Secretary of State for India in CP. 119 (33) of the 4th May.Finally, I must, emphasise to my colleagues the limitations, as well as the potentialities, of military action. A country like Egypt cannot be governed by British troops. Lord Allenby in 1920 enjoyed the assistance of a full British Civil Service in Egypt, with Advisers in practical control of every Department of the Government; yet he was obliged to authorise the recallof Zaghlul and the other deportees, because he could not find an Egyptian Government to take office on any other terms, and he could not govern Egypt solely by Englishmen. To-day Egypt is a monarchy and not a protectorate, and the British Civil Service has been scattered to the four winds by the Act of Indemnity of 1923, and we are rapidly moving towards the same situation which confronted Lord Allenby. I must confess my inability to see how we can hope to meet this situation successfully and without creating all the factors of internal disturbance and attempted foreign intervention which it is the avowed object of the policy advocated by the report to avoid.It is my own conviction that to press our military requirements in Egypt to the point advocated by the report can lead to no other result than the resumption by this country, in circumstances of chaos and disorder similar to those which prevailed in the period 1919-1922, of what will be not merely in fact but in name a protectorate over Egypt. If such a situation should arise, are we prepared to meet it ? It would involve a large increase in the numbers of the Army of Occupation. Would the War Office be prepared to supply them on its present establishment ? And, if not, would the Treasury be prepared to concur in the expense involved in such an increase of the establishment, even if such an increase were compatible with the commitments into which we may have entered at Geneva ? I believe that the answers to both questions would be in the negative.Should a treaty policy based on the transfer of our troops to the Canal Zone break down, as it conceivably may, upon Egyptian refusal to accept less than was offered in 1930, some such result may be inevitable. But it is, in my opinion, essential to make every effort to avoid being confronted with a situation which must denote the collapse of the policy laid down eleven years ago, and a return to the difficult and unhappy conditions which prevailed between the end of the war and the declaration of 1922.In a word, the Foreign Office is fully alive to all the arguments dealing with the vital necessity of guarding our Imperial communications, and would desire as sincerely as the Chiefs of Staff that this awkward choice need not be faced. I feel, however, that it must inevitably be faced, and that the memorandum of the
Chiefs of Staff represents the world as we would all have it, and not as it is. There is no prospect whatever, in my view, of the present, or any, Egyptian Government accepting any treaty which maintains the British troops in or near Cairo. If I am right, insistence on this point means the abandonment of the treaty policy, and reversion to the position described in the preceding paragraphs. I must here also briefly repeat what I have pointed out before : that, in the event of the failure of the treaty policy, Egypt will apply for and gain admittance to the League, and we shall then be left without any legal basis for any occupation at all. I wish all this were otherwise, but it is not.J SJune 2, 1933.
