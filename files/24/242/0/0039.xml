DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET,CABINET,CP. 189(33). Copy No. . . .    . . .TRAINING AND OCCUPATION FOR THE UNEMPLOYED NEXT WINTER.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,le      The remarkable improvement in the employment figures during the past few months and the general trade indications afford some hopa&apos; that the employment position as a v/hole next winter will be materially better than it was last v^inter, and that the improvement3 while it is likely to be more substantial in the south of England than in the north or Wales, will be fairly v/ell distributed.    Some increase in the numbers of the registered unemployed is almost inevitable owing tc seasonal causes..3.      It should be clear by now that no direct intervention by the Government, in the employment market,  through the provision of public works,  etc. can do anything to the employment figures comparable with the effect of ordinary trade improvement which flows from the soundness of the Government&apos;s general policy,,    In other word.s, the unemployment policy of the Government must be a reflection of its general financial, foreign and commercial policy.    It will be necessary to emphasise this from time to time,,    The trade improvement in the last two months took over a quarter of a million men off the unemployed registers.    This is more than twice the highest number of men that have been put into employment at any time on State-aided public works in this country, despite the enormous expenditure on those works.3.      But the improvement in trade and in the employment figures must not conceal the fact that in the difficult industrial areas of the north and Wales there are large numbers of men who have been unemployed for a long time and are likely to continue to be unemployed.More than half the persons claiming under the Unemployment Insurance Acts are now receiving transitional payments and not unemployment benefit, and in the case of wholly unemployed men the proportion on transitional
payments is still higher.    Pending the new scheme it is obviously necessary to do as much as is possible to maintain the, employability of those workpeople, especially the younger ones, and I set out therefore the programme of training and reconditioning under the auspices of my Department which will be in operation next winter, (a) JuvenilesBThere are at present 151 juvenile instructional centres with an average attendance of 14,000 unemployed juveniles; this is an increase over last year of 3 centres.The number of unemployed juveniles including  tho&amp;e not registered at      Exchanges is probably in the neighbourhood of 120,000, so that the number attending Centres,  though substantial in itself,  is only a small proportion of the total.    The position is not so unsatisfactory as might appear from these figures, since the Centres are for the most part concentrated in the areas of worst unemployment and many of the unemployed juveniles not attending Centres live in districts where unemployment is so slight that there is little or no need for special provision.    There is, however, plenty of room for improvement,  especially in view of the increase in the numbers of children leaving school in the next year or two.    I have been urged from various quarters both Inside and outside the House to  take some action which will bring a larger proportion of unemployed juveniles within the scope of these instructional centres and in the Bill which E have in preparation I intend to make proposals which I hope will pave a substantial effect in this direction. Kb)  (i) Training for men.There are 8 handymen&apos;s training centres where unemployed men attend for 6 months and are given instruction to fill improvership vacancies in various types of skilled work.    The success of these sentres depends upon the ability to place the men at the conclusion f the course, and the numbers of men in attendance is therefore conditioned by the prospects of giving them employment.    The attendance it the centres is at the rate of over 4,000 per annum.    The great lajority of the trainees have been placed in employment.. :
(b) (ii)    There are 9 centres at present in operation providing10 to 12 weeks reconditioning for over 8,000 men in all.    industrial conditions do not permit of placing more than a small number of themen on completion of the course, and the centres are thereforedesigned to maintain employability aid the physical and mental fit-ness of the men.     It will be remembered that on the termination ofthe relief works programme the Cabinet approved this policy,  ratherthan closing down the centres.     In addition during the summer therehave been attached to these centres 5 tented camps,  an economicalform of expanding the capacity of the centres.     These tented campsare extended to provide a course for 1,100 men in all.The tented camps are based upon the centre, and are under the general supervision of the Manager. / In other respects they reproduce many of the conditions of a pioneer camp, the site chosen being usually in a remote spot where the men must improvise for themselves their amenities and recreations./&apos;   These conditions have made an immediate appeal to the men,  and the camps have secured the friendly interest of the neighbouring villages and landowners.This programme of instructional centres is being rapidly expanded for next winter,  and there will be opened at varying dates additional centres atGlenbranter (Argyllshire), Kielder (Nor thumb er-land), Kershcpe Foot (Cumberland), Hamsterley (Co. Durham), Allerston (North Yorkshire),  and Brechfa (Carmarthenshire), which will give a course to about 5,000 men in a year.     Several of these centres lend themselves to an expansion with summer camps next summer.The northern centres are very hilly,  and the men will have the invigorating task of making roads through rocky land over some of the peaks, quarrying the stone from the estate.    It is of interest that at   Kielder the North Eastern Railway have laid down a special siding for the centre free of charge, in order to facilitate the transfer of the men and materials.All these centres are residential, unemployed single men being brought to the centres from the depressed areas.     They receive their board and lodging and in addition a small sum weekly for pocket money;    against this expenditure is set off the amount of
unemployment pay to which they are entitled.    Where necessary working kit is served out to them.    The residential centres provide the most effective method of improving the employability of the men because the corporate activities of the centre after working hours are not the least impbrtant part of the course, and the general policy will continue to be based, upon residential centres.   But the residential centres are open to the objection that they do not cater for the married men owing to the expense that would be involved in paying for   the maintenance of the families.    Therefore,, as an experiment,  a-non-residential centre is being opened in South Wales close to an industrial neighbourhood where there is severe unemploy-ment,  and every effort will be made to get the younger married men to come to that centre.    If the experiment proves a success it will be possible to extend it in other places.All these centres are on land belonging to the Forestry Commission.    The work,  as at the existing centres, will consist of instruction in elementary woodwork and metal work, trenching,  shoring and timbering,  road making, quarrying,  etc.    On the existing land in the possession of the Forestry Commission it will be possible to add two or three more centres.    If a substantial expansion of the centres on Forestry land is required,  arrangements will have to be made with the Forestry Commission for the purchase of additional land and for the provision of finance for that end.Another interesting experiment capable of expansion is also eing  attempted. The town of Bilston in the Lidlands possesses land encumbered by slag heaps which the Municipality desire to have evelled for the purpose of making recreation grounds, housing sites, -tc.   By arrangement with the Ministry they have put some of this and at the disposal of the Department as a site for a reconditioning entre, which will take 120 men at a time, or some 500 in all for he work Involved.    The Ministry will conduct the centre on the same ines as the centres on the Forestry Commission estates, and the
9 i iinstruction will include the levelling of the land.      The centre will he non-residential, and the men attending it will continue to receive the unemployment benefit or transitional payments to which they are entitled;    in addition they will receive a midday meal and 2s a week training allowance.      The Local Authority will reimburse the Department the cost of the  scheme apart from the cost of the benefit or transitional payments.It is possible that the scheme may be criticised in certain quarters on the ground that the men are doing the kind of work which ought to be paid for at public works wages, and are only receiving for their work the  &apos;dole&apos; plus food and pocket money.     But the fact is that if the work were only to be done as an employment scheme at full wages it would not be done at all.      The Local Authority appreciate the possibility of criticism but have decided that they will face it in view of the opportunity it gives to their own unemployed workpeople.The centre will be opened early in September and if it-proceeds successfully, as is anticipated, it will be possible to make similar arrangements with other Authorities.     An extension of the same principle to land drainage works with Catchment Area Authorities is under examination for one or two places.The importance of this experiment is that if it is desired to give useful occupation to larger numbers of men without incurring the heavy expenditure which, among other things,, has put a stop to public works conducted by Local Authorities, this method may prove very valuable.(c)    Training Facilities for Women.The training of unemployed women and girls is carried on by the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment on behalf of, and financed by a grant from, the Ministry of Labour.     The Central Committee has set up a separate Sub-Committee for Scotland.For the most part the training given by the ,Central Committee has been directed towards fitting unemployed women and girls for domestic employment, and since 1921 over 60,000 have passed through the Training Centres of the Central Committee.
The training is given in two types of Centre, non-Residential and Residential.      Instruction in cookery, housewifery,  laundry and needlework on practical lines approximating as nearly as possible to those obtaining in a private residence is given at the Centres.      Courses are conducted at 26 non-Residential and 7 Residential Centres which enable about 4,400 women and girls to be trained in this way during the year.Steps are taken to find suitable vacancies for the trainees at the conclusion of their courses, and enquiries made subsequently show that about 80 per cent,  of those placed in domestic employment have settled satisfactorily into their new occupation.(d)  (i)    The efforts of Voluntary Organisations. Much the most important of these is the system of local voluntary occupational centres being started by local communities for their own unemployed under the inspiration of the National Council of Social Service.      At the present rate of progress at least 300,000 men v/ill be attending these occupational centres by next winter;    the numbers are rising steadily.      The great majority of the centres now provide various types of interesting occupation for the men, and those centres which have hitherto teen only recreational are gradually introducing occupational classes.The cost of this work to central funds has been negligible; most of the money has in fact been provided &quot;by the local communities.     But the expenditure is not the measure of the size and importance of this work.     There is evidence that the whole movement is becoming established and that it is promoting an understanding of the need for each community to do what it can for its own unfortunate members rather than to look to some central organisation for money or guidance.      Out of it may develop a widespread permanent scheme of local institutes with occupational classes, run locally.
It must, however, &quot;be emphasised that the success of this movement depends upon its retaining local support and continuing on the &quot;basis of voluntary local effort free from State control and without any compulsion on unemployed men to aVail themselves of the opportunities offered &quot;by communal service for making use of their enforced leisure.  . -   -What is &quot;being done in this way is not a substitute for measures which fall within the responsibility of the Government, and it is important that the Government should not seek to take credit for the various activities which have been developed in this field.(c)  (ii) Connected with the local centres though operated separately, is the movement for the provision of allotments for the unemployed in which the Society of Friends have taken a leading part. There are some 120,000 allotments now under cultivation by unemployed persons, and the Society anticipate doubling that number in the course of the next year or two.      The Treasury have agreed to a grant to enable 200,000 allotments to be brought into cultivation next year.(c)  (iii) Proposals are now under consideration for arranging, through Local Educational Authorities, a large extension of physical training for the unemployed and others.      This scheme which would be started economically and modestly may develop into an important and popular movement, as there is no doubt of an increasing interest in physical fitness.4. It will be seen that all these efforts are to provideoccupation and to maintain employability, and not to give employment for wages, a policy which would raise entirely different considerations. Nor does the programme deal with the possibility of putting more workpeople on-to the land as independent cultivators.      There is room for small experiments on these lines, and it is possible that it will be iindertaken in the near future, but the provision of small holdings, rtiich in any case is outside the province of my Department, must form part of the agricultural policy of the country, and the Minister of Agriculture has called attention to the importance of ensuring that those persons now on the land are enabled to earn a living from it before adding artificially to their number.(Intd.)
