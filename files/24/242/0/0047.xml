(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY13 GOVERNMENT).copy no.   ;4*aSECRETCP. No. 197 (33)CABINETy india appreciation of the Political Situation by the Government of India, dated 21st July 1933.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated 21st July 1933, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State four India.The period of suspension of Civil Disobedience has afforded Congress an opportunity for stode-talcing, and has been marked by signs of profound differences in Congress circles as to future policy.       The Left Wing, probably the smaller party, have been in favour of a militant policy and of the continuance and intensification of the movement.     The Right Wing have frequently admitted that the movement has failed and have been advocating that it should be abandoned, or at least indefinitely suspended.     They have favoured a constructive, and not merely a negative policy;    but as to what form this policy should take, there are considerable differences of opinion.     Some consider that Congress influence will best be re-established by concentration on the social and economic side of their programme, on such matters as removal of untouch-ability , development of Swadeshi industries and rectification of grievances of labour, or of tenantry,all of which afford opportunity for direct appeal to the masses.Others favour flatly the definite participation in politics on constitutional linos;    to quoto from an open letter addressed to Gandhi &quot;the ballot bos is an objective and all can join in tho game;    if our morale and discipline are what I believe they are, the capture of the citadel is not beyond possibility&quot;.       These varying lines of thought have led to much heated controversy between newspapers which have hitherto been unanimous in their support of Congress policy.     It is significant that several nationalist papers which have hitherto not hinted at any imperfections in Gandhirs leadership or motives
have taken a critical attitude to?*ards him.During all this controversy Gandhi gave only one indication of his views, when, in reply to the open letter referred to above, he repeated his old saying that &quot;non violence&apos;^ was a part of his life and added &quot;the whole creed of 3atyagraha:, non-co-operation, civil disobedience and the like, is a necessary deduction of the fundamental proposition that non-violence is the law of life for human beings:    for me, it is both a means and an end and I am more than ever convinced that in the complex situation that faces India, there is no other way of gaining real freedom.&quot;   This somewhat cryptic utterance in regard to civil disobedience was in agreement with that made on his release, while its reference to gaining real freedom for India shows that Gandhi never loses sight of the ultimate object of the Congress policy - complete, independence,It was necessaiT that Congress    should come to some conclusions of policy before the end of July, when the second period of suspension of civil disobedience terminates,, A Conference of Congress leaders was therefore summoned to meet at Poona on July 12th.     There is little doubt that a majority of delegates were in favour of extricating themselves by action not dependent on any reciprocity of Government, from a movement which was increasingly felt to be paralysing the whole Congress organisation. To this, however,Gandhi was firmly opposed and in his speech, as reported, he contended that unconditional withdrawal would mean absolute surrender and humiliation.      Gandhi was determined not to withdraw the movement with which his own personal reputation was so completely identified, unless he could secure from Government terms which might approximate to those of the pact of 1931.
ZilIt is doubtful whether he thought there was really any chance of Government in the end adopting a policy which they had repeatedly asserted they would not adopt, but at any rate, having made up his mind not to withdraw civil disobedience without conditions, he hau nothing to ip.se and much to gain by representing himself as anxious for peace and asking for an interview with the Viceroy. Accordingly, while persuading Congress leaders to agree that civil disobedience should be resumed unless a satisfactory settlement could be reached with Government, he obtained their endorsement to his ashing for an interview with the Viceroy to explore the possibilities of peace. To this there could be only one answer and, in refusing an interview, His Excellency reiterated the policy of Government that there could be no question of making a bargain with Congress as a condition of further co-operation.To this Gandhi has sent a further reply and his contention that his Association is engaged in activities in breach of repressive State laws, has been met by pointing out that the object of Congress is to coerce Government by unlawful activities and that -Government cannot hold conversations with tho representative of an Association which has not abandoned such a movement.It was apparently part of Mr. gandhis policy to conceal the fact that Congress had authorised resumption of civil disobedience if ho was unable to obtain an interview with the Viceroy.     But though the press were carefully excluded from the Conference, it was impossible to keep tho discussion secret.       Mr. Gandhi has complained that the news was unauthorised, but he has not been able to assert that it was untrue.
The decision of the Corf erencs-was recognised at once in India as a triumph for those who were not prepared to abandon civil disobedience and it was common knowledge that that result was due to Mr. gandhis own attitude.   The humble advice which he claims to.tender to Congress is of the kind that no one in that organisation has the courage openly to resist.But, while Mr. Gandhi has carried his point and has committed Congress to continuing civil disobedience in some form, he must be well aware that he has not reallyconvinced those who are opposed to this policy and that in the ordinary course their views will gather strength If time goes 031 and his policy still show no practical results. If Mr. Gandhi goes quietly back to jail opposition to his policy is bound to gather quickly.      It is unlikely that Congress will bs able to revive mass civil disobedience over any large area.Mr. Gandhi rs references to individual civil disobed--ience goes to show that even he recognises that the mass movement has failed and it seems possible that he may embark on some very spectacular action in order to create popular sympathy for a line of policy which reason suggests to be unwise and sterile.During the month of Juno there was a still further marked decrease in.the number of civil disobedience prisoners and tho total number at the end of the month was only 6,883; there is thus now only about one person out of every 38,000 ox the population of British India in prison for offences arising out of Congress activities.     Since the close of the month there has been still further reduction in the number of prisoners in the United Provinces who now only number
460, while in the North West Frontier Province about one third of the total number of prisoners, about 1,600, have been released without any ill-effects.The hunger strike of terrorist prisoners in the Andaman Islands ceased on  6th June without any further casualties.
