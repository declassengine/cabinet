P. C.ottish Office,16th June, 1933.
MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL EXPENDITURE (SCOTLAND)1. The Secretary of State desires to draw the particular attention of Local Authorities to the Report of the Committee on Local Expenditure (Scotland).   Cmd. 4201.The Committee consisted of nine members of great experience in local administration, nominated, at the invitation of the Government, by the Association of County Councils in Scotland, the Convention of Royal Burghs, and the Association of Councils of Counties of Cities. The report of the Committee clearly calls for very careful considera-tion on the part both of the Government and Local Authorities.CHAPTER I AND CHAPTER VIII.-GENERAL FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION (Pages 15-16 and Pages 116-117)2. The Committee recommend in paragraphs 26, 292, and 293 that the present debt should be regarded as the peak of Local Authority borrowing, and that it should be the aim of every Local Authority to get below this peak ; that all borrowing on rating account, with the exception of borrowing for capital expenditure on housing, should be limited during each of the next three years to such a sum as will hot exceed the statutory amount of debt repayment or sinking fund instalment payable during the year during which borrowing is desired ; that borrowing beyond the limit referred to should only be allowed with the consent of the appropriate Govern-ment Departments, and that notwithstanding the terms of Section 23 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, Local Authorities should be debarred from adding to their present debt except with the consent of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and then only in special circumstances.3. To give effect to the recommendation of the Committee that Local Authorities should not add to their present debt except under sanction legislation would be necessary. Apart from this point, however, the foregoing recommendations should be taken into immediate consideration by Local Authorities.4. The Secretary of State does not suggest the adoption of a hard and fast rule that present capital commitments are not to be exceeded.   The policy of the Government with regard to capital (10694 c) b
expenditure was stated in the House of Commons on the 22nd March last by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was then made clear that the Government did not consider that restrictions should be placed on the undertaking of works of reasonable utility by Local Authorities provided the financial condition of the Local Authority concerned was such as to justify the proposed expenditure, and it was indicated that this was the attitude that would be adopted by the Minister of Health in considering whether sanction could be given to proposals by Local Authorities.In Scotland capital expenditure is a matter largely within the discretion of Local Authorities themselves. The Secretary of State has no doubt that they are fully alive to their responsibilities in this connection, and that they will take special care to satisfy themselves as to the real utility of any proposed capital expenditure, and that the expenditure does not place an undue burden on the Authority. The Report of the Committee indicates that the latter point is one which should receive particular consideration in the light of the burden of existing debt.5. It is further recommended in paragraphs 26 and 296 that all Local Authority loans should be reviewed with the object of taking advantage where possible of the lower rates of interest now prevailing. The Secretary of State has no doubt that the possibility of reducing loan charges by this means has been present to the minds of most if not all Local Authorities. In view, however, of the importance of securing that no opportunity of reducing these charges is missed it is suggested that a review of all loans should be undertaken forthwith, and repeated periodically. In this connection, regard should also be had to the possibility of taking advantage of the present exceptionally low rates of long-term interest to fund short-term bonds and mortgages.So far as loans from the Public Works Loan Board are concerned, however, it must be pointed out that these loans are made out of the Local Loans Fund which is financed by the issue of Local Loans Stock. The interest charged depends on the price at which the stock could be issued at the time the loan was made, and cannot be altered.6. In paragraph 26 (2) the Committee refer to the desirability of avoiding the existing competition of Local Authorities in the money market for loans. It is suggested that Local Authorities should consider whether by improved co-ordination simultaneous borrowing of large sums by Local Authorities in the market can be avoided.7. The recommendation in paragraph 26 (5) that in no case should the Finance Committee of a Local Authority act as a spending department is one to which the attention of Local Authorities is especially directed.
The function of a Finance Committee is to regulate and control the finance of the Local Authority, as is specifically provided in the case of counties by Section 75 (3) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1889. The financial transactions of County Councils and the Tov/n Councils of Large Burghs are now considerably increased, and it is eminently desirable that the regulation and control of finance should have the undivided attention of the Committee. In par-ticular, reference or delegation by the Council to this Committee of administrative functions involving expenditure is not consistent with the purposes for which it is set up. In the words of the Report, it should be exclusively occupied with financial policy and all that this entails, and with the scrutiny, authorisation, and supervision of accounts.CHAPTER II. EDUCATION (Pages 17-43)8. Education Authorities have no doubt already given careful consideration to those parts of the Report of the Committee which deal with the local administration of education. Indeed, the Scottish Education Department have received evidence that measures have already been taken in some areas to give effect to a number of the recommendations in so far as they lie within the discretion of the Authorities. But the Authorities will expect that the Depart-ment should make some statement of their own views, especially in relation to those matters which are affected by the Departments codes and regulations. Accordingly, the Department have studied closely the educational sections of the Report, and they now bring the following considerations and conclusions to the notice of the Education Authorities.9. Those Recommendations of the Committee which are con-cerned with the salaries of teachers are not considered here, as the Department are dealing with those questions separately.10. There is a special reason why Authorities should as soon as possible examine every means of effecting economies that lie/ within their statutory powers. As has been intimated separately, the sum of money available for grants in aid of public education in Scotland has again been reduced. In consequence, the amount available from the Education (Scotland) Fund for distribution as grants to Education Authorities for the year ending 15th May, 1934, must be correspondingly curtailed : it is estimated to be approximately  230,000 less than the amount available in the year 1932-33. In these circumstances it will be necessary for (10694 c) b2
every Education Authority to seek further economies in educational expenditure if the part of. that expenditure which falls to be met from rates and from derating grants is not to be increased.11. In what follows the Department consider certain of the Committee&apos;s Recommendations and indicate what action may in their opinion be taken consistently with the maintenance of reason-able standards in the public provisions of school buildings, teachers, equipment, books and other educational services. The specific Recommendations will be found,on pages 40 to 43 of the Report.12. The Committee consider that in certain areas and, more particularly, in certain types of school, the number of teachers employed is in excess of what is necessary. The Department must ensure that the maximum size of classes prescribed by the Codes is not exceeded, and they do not contemplate any amendment of the Codes in this respect; but they are aware that the staffing of schools is not infrequently in excess of Code requirements. The Department would specially direct the attention of Education Authorities to the figures quoted in the last column of Appendix X on page 135 of the Committee&apos;s Report. These show that the number of teachers has increased from 24,908 in 1921-22 to 27,622 in 1931-32. In the same period of ten years the number of scholars on the registers has declined from 863,228 to 823,668. In view of these figures and even after making due allowance for the reduction in the maximum size of primary classes brought into force in 1928, for the increase of teachers necessitated by the development of alternative courses in post-primary departments and for the presence in these departments of the exceptionally large number of children born in 1920, the Department are of opinion that there is scope for economy here. Each Education Authority should, therefore, make a thorough survey of this question school by school. There is little doubt that such a survey would lead to a considerable saving of staff over the whole country followed by further sub-stantial savings when the coming fall in average attendance renders them possible, and this saving could be effected without any appreci-able loss of efficiency. They agree with the Committee that teachers should not be dismissed for reasons of over-staffing, but they feel that whenever a vacancy occurs in the ordinary way the Education Authority should take the opportunity of reviewing their scale of staffing with a view to economising numbers.13. The Committee recommend that, particularly in rural areas, Authorities should be permitted to arrange that children be not compelled to attend school before six years of age.In rural districts where the pupils&apos; homes are at a considerable distance from the schools the Authorities have for some time exercised a certain discretion in the enforcement of attendance
below the age of six years. The Department consider this policy reasonable, they have taken no exception to it in the past and they think that it should be continued.14. The Committee recommend that bursaries should be granted only in necessitous cases and should be strictly confined to qualified students whose educational attainments give promise that they are likely to benefit from further instruction.This Recommendation merely states the general effect of the relative statutory provision (section 4 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918), and the Department would remind Authorities that, although the amount of the assistance that may be given to a student is within their discretion, the statutory requirements as to the circumstances of the parents and the promise of profiting by the assisted education must be satisfied before any assistance may be granted. Education Authorities should, accordingly, consider what opportunity for a reasonable economy is offered by a re-consideration of the criteria of means and attainments which they apply in their bursary schemes.15. The question of reduction in the expenses of the local administration of education is a matter for the Education Authori-ties themselves, and no doubt they are giving it close attention as part of their review of the administrative costs of all their services. The question of wages and salaries is dealt with on general lines in paragraph 41 of this Memorandum. At this point the Department need do no more than point out that the cost of the local administration of education was  218,037 in 1919, while in 1931 it had risen to  413,894. The Department would accord-ingly urge Authorities to continue to examine closely all opportunities for economy and in particular those afforded by the combination of staffs consequent on the transfer of functions to the County Councils under the Local Government (Scotland) Act of 1929.16. The Committee&apos;s Recommendation as to the centralisation of higher classes is based on the situation that exists in certain parts of the country where there are small schools with small classes, especially at the most advanced stages. In such circum-stances staffing is expensive. It will be for the Authorities to investigate the possibility of saving in this matter, and the investi-gation would naturally proceed along two lines. In the first place, they will have to consider whether the number of centres for secondary and advanced division schools should be reduced, and weigh the financial and educational advantages of a reduced number of centres against the increased cost of travelling allowances and perhaps the necessity of hostel accommodation. In the second place, within the centres themselves, they will have to consider the possibilities of economy in staffing which are consistent with efficient instruction.   Something can certainly be done along this
line, and there are indeed positive advantages in allowing the eldest children to work independently of the teacher, provided that he is available when they are confronted with special difficulties.Centralisation in the rural districts has been greatly facilitated in the last generation by the rapid developments that have taken place in the transport service, but there are still parts of the country where the policy at once raises difficult questions as to the provision of travelling and lodging facilities. Each case must be considered by itself. But it may be stated with confidence that in the counties in general there is no need for increasing the number of secondary centres. On the contrary, there would be fewer centres now if the great development of secondary education that has taken place this century had been organised by County Authori-ties and not by the smaller Local Authorities, the School Boards, who preceded them.In urban areas it is clear that centralisation of all post-qualifying work is the proper policy, both from an educational and from a financial point of view. There has been a steady development on these lines during the last 25 years, but it can be carried still further.It is worth pointing out that, wherever a policy of centralisation is to be put into force, it is most desirable to make every effort to secure the parents&apos; goodwill beforehand. The Department know of several instances where difficulties have arisen because the new scheme did not commend itself to the parents, sometimes for no other reason than that its advantages from their children&apos;s point of view had not been fully explained to them.17. The Committee recommend that where fees are exigible they should be exacted if the financial position of the parent so warrants.The law as to the provision of free secondary education is stated in section 6(1) (a) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918. The Department are advised that in considering what is &quot; adequate &quot; provision of free secondary education it is legitimate and indeed necessary to take into account the requirements of the community, and in particular the ability of the average parent to pay school fees for the education of his children ; and that the provision of free schools should be the major element and the provision of fee-paying schools the subordinate element. If, as a result of their consideration of the requirement for free secondary education in their area, an Authority decide to alter their scheme for the pro-vision of such education, a revised scheme made in accordance with the terms of section 6(1) (a) and 6(2) of the Act of 1918 must be submitted to the Department for their consideration in terms of section 27 of that Act.
18. The Committee recommend that Continuation Classes should be further centralised where geographical circumstances permit, that the size of the classes should be increased, and that classes which are of less educational, cultural, or technical value should be suspended or made self-supporting.The Department are aware that most Education Authorities have recently given careful consideration to these questions, and that many of them have substantially reduced their expenditure on this branch of their work. The possibilities of effecting reason-able economies in this matter should still be kept in view.19. The Committee recommend that in certain circumstances Attendance Officers might be gradually dispensed with. As this is a matter for each Education Authority to consider in relation to the social and economic conditions of its area, the Department can only draw attention to certain general considerations. They feel it perhaps desirable to remind Authorities that economies in this matter should be made with discretion and with a due sense of the primary duty as to school attendance laid on Education Authorities by the statute (section 70 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1872). Each Education Authority must see that children of school age are enrolled in the schools and that they attend regularly. Moreover, in some areas Attendance Officers are con-cerned not only with securing regular and punctual attendance at school but also with work of great social importance connected with the feeding, clothing, protection and care of neglected children.20. The economies suggested by the Committee regarding equipment of schools, stationery and text-books are largely within the discretion of each Education Authority. Section 3 (6) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1908, enables Education Authorities to provide books, stationery, etc:, where they consider such provision required. In so far as such provision is necessary for efficient education, His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors must be satisfied that the supply is adequate for the requirements of the curriculum. But there is an opportunity for reasonable economy in this matter, and the Depart-ment do not doubt that the Education Authorities will carefully review their existing arrangements.21. With regard to the question of school buildings, the Depart-ment would not feel justified in altering the views set out in the Recommendations to be followed in the Planning and Fitting Up of Schools, 1925. The standards embodied therein are the result of a steady development of ideas in the last sixty years and, in the Departments opinion, they are in no way too exacting. Well-lit and well-ventilated schools with a sufficiency of floor space are hygienic and educational necessities. But the Department cannot sanction any plan which involves expenditure on elaborate buildings and costly internal fittings.   Authorities should, therefore, take
special care to subject plans and specifications of new buildings to the most thorough scrutiny in order to eliminate everything that is not essential. By a careful choice of material and by simplification of the design a large amount of money can often be saved. The Department are at all times willing to co-operate with Local Authorities in achieving these aims.22. The Committee are of opinion that the position in regard to Libraries is unsatisfactory and that there is an amount of over-lapping which should be avoided. While this may be the situation in some areas, the Department are not disposed to agree with the suggestion that the remedy lies in a return to differential rating. The Department are aware that in certain areas duplication of Library services has been eliminated by a unification of the whole library work as an educational service, and they would suggest that this solution of the problem might be considered in all areas. Where existing Burgh Libraries are included in the educational library service of the county, arrangements can be made under Section 5 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, for a payment from the Educa-tion Account of the County to the Library Account of the Burgh in consideration of the book service provided by the Burgh Library for educational purposes. The advantages of a unified library service under the general supervision of the Education Committee are obvious, and Authorities should give their careful consideration to this matter.CHAPTER III.-ROADS AND BRIDGES (Pages 44-45)23. The recommendations of the Committee with regard to roads are, generally speaking, in the sphere of the Minister of Transport, not the Secretary of State. The attention of Local Authorities is drawn, however, to the recommendation (paragraphs 109 and 112 (g) ) that economies should be effected in the Cleansing of Highways and Administrative and other General Expenses by a thorough overhaul of present methods and practice.CHAPTER IV.-POLICE (Pages 56-64)24. The recommendations of the Committee in regard to police matters have already been dealt with in the Scottish Office Circulars, No. 2712 of the 5th January, 1933, and No. 2728 of the 8th February,
CHAPTER V.-HOUSING (Pages 65-82)25. The Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act, 1933, deals with housing subsidies in Scotland, and a circular has already been issued by the Department of Health for Scotland containing further observations on the subject of housing policy.26. The recommendation of the Committee to the effect that State-assisted houses should not continue to be occupied by classes of persons for whom they were not intended has already been dealt with in the circular which the Department of Health for Scotland issued on 3rd February, 1933, to Local Authorities. The Depart-ment also approve the recommendation of the Committee that Repair Fund balances should be limited to a maximum level of 50 per cent, of the annual rental of the houses. As regards housing schemes under the Act of 1919 this has been given effect to by means of the Local Authorities (Assisted Housing Schemes) Amendment Regulations (Scotland), 1933, dated the 4th May, 1933, made by the Department of Health for Scotland. As regards schemes under other Acts the matter is one within the discretion of the Local Authority.CHAPTER VI.-PUBLIC ASSISTANCE (Pages 83-95)27. Several of the recommendations in this Chapter are such as could only be given effect to by legislation. The recommendation relating to the relief of able-bodied unemployed (paragraph 198) has to some extent already been dealt with in the recent pronouncement by the Government with reference to their acceptance of financial and administrative responsibility for the able-bodied unemployed. Other recommendations requiring legislation would involve material alterations in the present poor law practice in Scotland. For that reason they require and are receiving most careful consideration. As regards the suggested repeal of Section 105 (1) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924, which requires Local Authorities to leave out of account the first 7s. 6d. of National Health Insurance benefit when assessing the needs of applicants for poor relief, the1933, which were addressed to Police Authorities, and by the appoint-ment of a Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Ormidale to consider the question of the enlargement of the units of police administration.
Department of Health for Scotland while fully appreciating the reasons which weighed with the Committee are of opinion that it is not practicable to give effect to their recommendation.28. As regards the recommendations in paragraphs 208 and 209 relative to war disability pensions and savings of applicants for poor relief, these points have been provided for in the Transitional Payments (Assessment of Need) Act, 1932, which empowers Local Authorities to apply to applications for poor relief the provisions that are compulsory in the assessment of the needs of applicants for transitional payments.29. In paragraph 219 the need for restriction of travelling expenses within reasonable -limits, particularly with regard to the visitation of boarded-out children and other cases resident outwith the Local Authority area, is pointed out. The Department are satisfied that in many areas considerable saving could be effected in this connection.30. There are other recommendations in this Chapter to which Local Authorities might give effect under their present powers, and it is urged that immediate and earnest consideration should be given to these by each Local Authority.The Committee have been at pains to set forth the principles which should govern the administration of public assistance. Having regard to the present economic condition of the country it is essential that these principles should be carefully observed by all Local Authorities charged with public assistance administration.CHAPTER VII.-PUBLIC HEALTH (Pages 96-107)31. In Chapter VII, the Committee after reviewing public health organisation and discussing some of the branches of the service stated that their investigation had not led to the discovery of points in the administration of the health services where definite recommendations towards economy could be made. They were of opinion, however, that the whole question of health policy and administration required exhaustive review in relation to costs and purpose and that such a review would promote efficiency, obviate overlapping and ultimately reveal avenues for economy. They recommended &quot; that an independent inquiry into the whole subject of public health from every standpoint health, social, administrative and financial be at once instituted.&quot;The Department of Health for Scotland agree with this recom-mendation of the Committee and regard the time as opportune for
carrying it into effect. Steps are being taken to appoint a Com-mittee of Inquiry, and the Department are confident that Local Authorities will render to the Committee all necessary assistance in the comprehensive inquiry suggested.In view of the inquiry, it is not thought necessary to discuss the comments of the Committee on,points of detail in the health services.32. The other main recommendation of the Committee in this chapter is that &quot; the Department of Health should periodically, say every three or five years, make a survey of the various hospitals in Scotland from the medical, financial, and administrative stand-points and supply to the Local Authorities the results of their investigation in order that Local Authorities may be stimulated to effect economies where possible.&quot;Most Local Authorities are still engaged in the reorganisation of their hospital services following on the transfer of functions and institutions at 15th May, 1930, and the advice and assistance of the Department of Health for Scotland on questions of policy, administra-tion and finance are always available, and have already been widely used by Local Authorities as occasion arose. The Department propose to consult Local Authorities on the question of their costing systems for institutions, and to consider whether it would be practicable to secure costing returns on a reasonably uniform and comparable basis and to collate these for the information of all Local Authorities.CHAPTER VIII.-MISCELLANEOUS (Page 108)33. The Committee refer in paragraph 261 to the possibility of reducing the expenses of advertising. The Secretary of State is prepared to consider any specific cases which Local Authorities may bring to his notice where they consider that existing requirements involve unnecessary expense.(Page 109.)34. In accordance with the recommendation of the Committee in paragraph 264 of their Report the attention of Town Councils is drawn to the provisions of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, relating to the audit of accounts and in particular to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Third Schedule to that Act.Prior to the Act of 1929 the Secretary of State had power to surcharge on an interim report of an auditor only in the case of County Council Accounts. This power was, however, extended to apply to Town Council Accounts by the Act of 1929. The general effect of the paragraphs referred to above which should
be referred to for their terms is that an auditor is required to make an interim report to the Secretary of State upon any payment which, in his opinion, is contrary to law or upon any failure to bring sums into account ; and that on receipt of the interim report the Secretary of State is required, subject to certain procedure and conditions, to disallow all illegal payments and surcharge the amount of any illegal payment or of any loss or deficiency on the persons concerned.(Pages 117 and 118)35. In paragraphs 297-299 the Committee refer to irregularities in dealing with offers for contracts and the effect on prices of &quot; rings.&quot;The Committee recommend :(1) That strict regulations as regards &quot; opening of offers&quot; should be laid down by all Authorities to ensure that the Com-mittee concerned should be the first to peruse any offers.(2) That undue consideration should not be paid to local con-tractors, but that the open market should be resorted to when estimates for supplies are under consideration.(3) Where feasible, contracts for supplies might be arranged on a regional basis by the Local Authorities in the area mutually agreeing to accept a contract for the combined supplies. Police clothing is a typical example. By agreement, similarity in the style and grade of uniform^ might with advantage be agreed upon and by means of a large contract keener prices secured.(4) Estimates for contracts of any importance should be openly advertised.It is clearly of the first importance that the letting of contracts by Local Authorities should be carried out in a regular and proper manner, and that all possible steps should be taken to secure that contracts are let upon the most favourable basis under open corn-petition. The Secretary of State would, therefore, urge Local Authorities who have not already done so to make regulations on the lines suggested by the Committee and to adopt the practice outlined^hy the recommendations. Attention is drawn to the advantages which the Committee point out can be obtained by combination of Local Authorities in contracting for supplies. The Committee&apos;s recommendations with regard to the standardisation of police uniforms, the placing of joint contracts for the supply of police clothing and the advertising of contracts for such clothing have already been dealt with in detail in the Scottish Office Circular No. 2728 of the 8th February, 1933, addressed to Police Authorities.36. Recommendations are made in paragraphs 300 and 301 with regard to the cost of attendance at meetings and the cost of deputations and conferences.
37. As regards attendance at meetings, it is pointed out that several County Councils have fixed lesser amounts than those allowed by the Fourth Schedule to the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929. The fixing of these allowances is a matter in which County Councils are doubtless guided by local circumstances ; but the Secretary of State would suggest that the allowances be again taken into consideration by County Councils in the light&quot; of the Committee&apos;s opinion that there is room for reductions.38. With the Committees view that the expenditure on deputa-tions and conferences should be curtailed, the Secretary of State, while he recognises the advantages which may be derived from certain conferences, is in complete agreement. The attention of Local Authorities is specially drawn to the desirability of making a careful scrutiny of the necessity for and probable value of any conferences, and of restricting the number of representatives to a minimum. In the Secretary of StateS opinion the conferences which call for the attendance of more than one representative of a Local Authority at the cost of the rates should be relatively few in number, and two representatives should be regarded as a maximum. He will be glad, therefore, if, in making application for his approval under Section 16 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, to the payment of expenses of representation at conferences, Local Authorities will keep these considerations in view.39. As regards deputations, the Secretary of State will, so far as he is concerned, arrange so far as possible for meetings to take place in Scotland, and in this he trusts to have the co-operation of the Local Authorities. Deputations should be restricted to matters which cannot adequately be disposed of by correspondence, and the number of members should be restricted to a minimum. In the case of County Councils, the Scottish Office Circular of the 22nd June, 1931 (No. 2558), proceeds on the view that normally the maximum number of members should be three, and in special cases with the special sanction of the County Council^, five. The Secretary of State sees no reason why these numbers should be exceeded by any Local Authority.(Page 119)40. The Committee in paragraph 302 draw attention to the saving which might be effected by the boarding out of patients in asylums who do not require institutional treatment.The system of boarding out such patients has been recommended in circulars and in their annual reports by the General Board of Control for Scotland who point out that it has long been characteristic of Scottish lunacy administration, and express regret that it is now less resorted to than formerly. The Board take the view that not only is the system economical, but that it is of advantage to the
patients. Further, the retention of patients who do not require treatment in mental hospitals, the primary object of which is the treatment of cases susceptible of benefit, is not desirable on general grounds. Such a practice obstructs the reception of cases which would benefit from the treatment provided, and, by unnecessarily increasing the severe pressure on asylum accommodation, may result in expensive building schemes.The Secretary of State requests, therefore, that Local Authorities will take into immediate consideration the possibility of resorting in greater measure to the boarding-out system.(Page 120)41. The Committee point out in paragraph 306, inter alia, that the number of wage-earners whose wages are chargeable to rates increased from 21,235 in 1913/14 to 74,044 in 1931/32, and that the cost of these wages increased in the same period from  1,970,042 to  12,683,805. They are of the opinion (paragraph 307) that, having regard to the figures they give, there is need in fairness to the rate-payers, for a full consideration of the wages and salaries position. They recommend, therefore, that all pay and salaries should be reviewed, that the sacrifice asked for from each should be neither more nor less than the sacrifice made or to be made in departments where the salary or pay is controlled or partly controlled by the State ; and that in considering any reduction or increase in pay, regard in all cases should be had to (a) Whether the service is pensionable or not.(b) Whether the salary was fixed in the &quot; peak period &quot; or in 1929-30.(c) What reductions were made in 1930-31.(d) How the pay or salary compares with that given in corresponding grades in industry.Certain action has already been taken by Local Authorities with respect to the remuneration of their officers in response to the sugges-tion made in the Scottish Office Circular No. 2578 of the 12th Sep-tember, 1931. The Committee, however, are clearly of opinion that there is still in this field opportunity for reasonable savings. In considering the recommendations made by the Committee in this connection, Local Authorities will, it is suggested, find it of advantage to discuss any proposals with their officers ; and they will also doubt-less bear in mind the desirability of securing a measure of uniformity as between Authorities. For this purpose it might be of advantage if Local Authorities were to consult with their associations, or com-mittees of these associations which might be set up for purposes of co-ordination, and to confer with the central organisation of the local officials.
42. In conclusion the Secretary of State desires to assure Local Authorities that the Government recognise the importance of the work which they perform and the difficulties which confront them in the effort to maintain the necessary standard of local services, and at the same time keep the burden of rates at a minimum in the general interest. These difficulties are especially acute in many areas at the present time, and certain aspects of the problem, as Local Authorities are aware, are at present receiving consideration by the Government. The Secretary of State has, however, no doubt that he can rely on Local Authorities in Scotland to maintain and increase the efficiency of their services while having due regard to economy.(10G94C) so e/aa
