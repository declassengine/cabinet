[This document is the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.Copy No.CABINET.Proposal to make a limited Experiment in the use of Tear Gas against armed Criminals in India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a copy of a letter from the Government of India, with its enclosures, in which a proposal is made that the Government of the Punjab should be authorised to make experimental use of tear-gas. for police purposes, within a limited field, in situations such as arise when armed criminals are brought to bay in a house or place of refuge.I agree with the views of the Government of India. While I am aware of the objections that have been urged against the adoption of this weapon against mobs, I do not consider that they can be applied to the limited experiment now proposed, the target of which will be desperate armed men and the possible result a saving of valuable lives.Only two conceivable points of difficulty appear to exist; first, the possibility of retaliation in kind by the criminals, and secondly, the possibility of complications should the use of tear gas, even for internal police purposes, be prohibited by international agreement. 1 am prepared to leave the first point to the decision of the Government of India in the light of their practical knowledge of the type of criminal concerned. As to the second, it is, I presume, almost inconceivable that the Disarmament or any other Conference would seriously consider the complete abolition of the use of harmless gas for internal police purposes or that Governments such as that of the United States would be disposed to entertain such a suggestion.I accordingly propose to inform the Government of India that, subject to their further consideration of the practical point I have mentioned, a limited experiment of the kind suggested may be undertaken, and that a full report on its working should be submitted to me for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government.India Office, S. H.15th June 1933.SECRET.CP. 161 (33).Secret Letter from the Government of India, Home Department, to the Secretary of State for India, dated 20th February 1933.Subject : Proposal to train a, picked body of the Punjab Police Force in the use of Tear Cas as an experimental measure.Sir,I am directed to forward for the consideration and orders of the Secretary of State in Council a copy of a letter from the Government of the Punjab, No. 38448, dated the 6th December 1932, and of its enclosures, on the subject noted above.2. In this connection I am to invite a reference to Sir James Crerar&apos;s demi-official letter to Sir Arthur Hirtzel,* No. 8/X/29J?olice, dated the 5th December 1929, from which it will be seen that a similar proposal made by the Government of the Punjab in. 1928 had to be abandoned for the time being on the ground that it might raise embarrassing problems for His Majesty&apos;s Government. Since then suggestions for the use of the gas against riotous crowds have been received from the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, and on two occasions from the Government of Bombay. The Government of India, however, refused to reopen the question on the grounds that (i) the consequences of the use of gas against mobs were unknown, and it might result in disastrous stampedes and panics ;* not printed.
(ii) it was not likely to be viewed favourably by public opinion in England andin India ; and(iii) its use was definitely opposed to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.There have been indications that public opinion in India, including opinion not ordinarily favourable to Government, may be less opposed than had been anticipated to the use of tear gas for the purpose of dispersing crowds. I am to enclose a typical extract from the Press (Tribune, dated 5th July 1931) and to say that the Committees appointed by the Bombay Municipality to enquire into the alleged police excesses during the last civil disobedience movement, suggested that tear gas would have been preferable to lathis as a means of dispersing non-violent crowds. From the replies given to Parliamentary questions, however, the Government of India understand that there has been no change in the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this subject, and the Government of India do not wish to raise the question of using gas for the dispersal of crowds, which in their opinion is open to the objection given at (i) above.3. The proposal made by the Punjab Government, however, stands on a different footing in that it relates to the use of gas only as an experimental measure against armed criminals brought to bay in a house or other place of refuge where then-capture cannot be effected by the police without risk of serious casualties. The Government of India consider that on such occasions the use of gas is unobjectionable and is unlikely to raise any public outcry if indeed it does not earn public approval. The Conference of the Inspectors-General of Police held last month expressed the opinion that the tear gas as now obtainable in the form of projectiles to be fired from a gun or pistol would be useful when searching houses for terrorists, arms or explosive substances.4. The Government of India consider that the Local Government should be given the opportunity of making experiments with the American weapon referred to in paragraph 2 of the Local Governments letter. In the opinion of the Government of India experiments designed to reduce the hazards to which the-police in India are constantly exposed deserve encouragement, and I am to request that in these circumstances the Secretary of State in Council may be moved to accord sanction to the experimental use of gas by the Punjab Government in the limited field of situations described by the Local Government. In the event of sanction being given the Government of India will obtain a full report on the results of their experiments for the information of the Secretary of State in Council.&apos;: I have, &amp;c,M. G. hallett, Secretary to the Government of India.The Secretary of State for India.Secret Letter No. 38448, dated the 6th December 1932, from the Government of the Punjab, to the Government of India, Home Department,I am directed by the Governor in Council to refer to the correspondence ending with Mr. EoyV letter* No. F. 8/X/29-Police, dated the 5th December 1929, regarding a proposal to train a picked body of Punjab police in the use of tear gas as an experimental measure. The Governor in Council is of opinion that there is good reason for reviving this proposal. There is no intention of using the gas, even experimentally, for the dispersal of crowds either in streets or in the open, but experienced police officers consider that it could be used effectively in situations such as arise when armed criminals are brought to bay in a house or other place of refuge where the police armed in the ordinaiy way cannot come to close quarters and finish off the encounter without incurring or risking casualties disproportionate to the object in view. In the Punjab, where the police are constantly called upon to round, up gangs of desperate dacoits, such situations arise not infrequently, and two recent examples may be cited : (a) On the 22nd December 1931 a party of the Ferozepore police surrounded five armed dacoits in a house in village Raimta. The dacoits refused to surrender and opened lire on the police party. The engagement lasted for two hours, in the course of which one of the dacoits was shot dead and two constables injured. The remaining four dacoits were forced into the open after the house had been set on fire and considerable damage done.
(b) On the 15th July 1932 Eattan Singh, the leader of a band of 10 convicts: who escaped from a train, was surrounded in a house in a village in the Hoshiarpur district. It took four hours to force him into the open, and during this period he shot a head constable, two constables and a zemindar. Two of the four casualties occurred in an attempt to set fire to the house.The Governor in Council thinks that there can be no possible objection to the -experimental use of tear gas in situations such as these.2. The Inspector-General of Police, Punjab, has obtained literature from the Lake Erie Chemical Gas Company of 5806, Hough Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America, regarding tear gas equipment. He considers the most suitable weapon to be the Long Range Field Gun (&quot;Shoulder Gun&quot;), and the Governor in Council desires that an experimental consignment, details of which are given in the attached statement,8&apos; be ordered. A price list and descriptive leaflet issued by the Lake Erie Chemical Gas Company is also enclosed.83. The Governor in Council is impressed with the superiority for the purposes in view of this device as compared with equipment of the hand grenade type, but I am to say that if the Government of India can obtain equipment suitable for use in the conditions contemplated from the Military Authorities or some other alternative source the Governor in Council would have no objection.4. I am to add that His Excellency in Council attaches great importance to this proposal being kept strictly secret and trusts that in the ordering and importing of the material required and in any correspondence on this subject strict secrecy will be observed.Extract from the &quot;Tribune,&quot; Lahore, dated the 5th July 1931.Tear Gas Not to be Used.Replying to the suggestion in the House of Commons that tear gas should be used for dispersal of crowds in India, Mr. Benn made a statement on 2nd July that the Government had rejected the suggestion after a most careful consideration. We, in India, do not know the reasons which have influenced the Governments decision in this matter ; nor does the Reuter&apos;s telegram on the subject show that the Secretary of State disclosed those reasons in Parliament. We have, however, no hesitation in saying that the decision of the Government will be generally regretted in this country. The frequent use of lathis or firearms for dispersing crowds is responsible for much of the bitterness which prevails between the people and the police in India ; and the broken limbs, the serious and not unoften fatal injuries and the trail of blood which necessarily follow a forcible dispersal of crowds, as well as the prolonged controversy whether the force used on a particular occasion was justified by the requirements of the situation, can all be avoided by the use of the tear gas. There can be no manner of doubt that the dispersal of an unlawful assembly by use of the gas is more humane than its dispersal by the lathi or the rifle. At the same time, gas is more effective than the use of lethal weapons against an obstinate crowd. The police in the United States and other countries, where the gas is used to disperse crowds, have had no difficulty in handling it; and we have no reason to believe that the police in India would not be able to use it with equal effect and ease after a little training. It is also an admitted fact that the use of tear gas against a crowd leaves no injurious after-effects. We hope that fact has not, influenced the decision of the Government, because, whatever view may be held by petty police officials, it is difficult to believe that the Government supports the idea of not only dispersing unlawful assemblies, but at the same time inflicting terrible punishment on the persons composing them. It is to be hoped that the Government will issue a detailed statement on the subject and reconsider its decision not to use the tear .gas for a purpose for which it is used with advantage in many civilised countries.
