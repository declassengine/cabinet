[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.Copy No.CABINET.DISARMAMENT. Suggested Prohibition of Air-bombing. Views of the Government of India.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.On the 9th April 1932 I circulated to my colleagues as OP. 126 (32) a telegram from the Government of India giving their views with regard to the prohibition of air-bombing. I now circulate in continuation a telegram which I sent to the Government of India on 31st May and their reply, together with a telegram dated 27th July 1932 to which it refers.India Office, S H.15th June 1933.SECRET.CP. 160 (33)Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Government of India, Army Department, dated 31st May 1933.1365. Please see my telegram dated to-day, No. 1366, reporting Geneva proceedings on question of bombing for police purposes.Object of reference in Article 34 to &quot; certain outlying regions &quot; is to retain the right to bomb (1) in British territories and territories under British protection or mandate (such as Aden Protectorate, mandated territories in Middle East and frontier tracts of India), and (2) in disturbed frontier areas where bombs might be dropped beyond an international frontier by aircraft in hot pursuit of raiders. Occasions for action under (2) above might arise, as in the past, in course of measures for protection of frontiers of Iraq. So far as India is concerned, however, Mr. Eden was authorised to inform the Afghan delegate privately that the outlying regions which we have in mind are only British territories or territories under British protection. We assume that in case of India question of police bombing beyond international frontiers does not arise, since we should never desire to take such action unless, for example, possibly at the express request of the Afghan Government (in which case no international com-plications could arise). Please telegraph whether this assumption is correct. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware that it is of the utmost importance to India to retain right to bomb in British tribal tracts (which are covered by the phrase &quot; territories under British protection &quot;).It seems to me very desirable that every endeavour should be made at Geneva, at any rate, to secure the continuance of our existing practice in India, including, for instance, the maintenance of bombing machines, either by maintaining text of Article 34 as it stands or, if this should prove impossible, by any alternative means that may appear most practicable.Please telegraph your views.Telegram from Government of India, Army Department, to Secretary of Statefor India., dated 5th June 1933.1394. Your telegram of the 31st ultimo, 1365. Except in the case of war, we cannot visualise any occasion on avhich question of bombing beyond international frontiers could arise. For, even if the Afghan Government were to request such action, we cannot agree to employ our personnel to conduct operations in a foreign countiy and on behalf of a foreign Power. A similar situation was met during the Khost rebellion of 1924 by the sale of machines to the Afghan Government with the strict condition that our pilots and mechanics avere not available for operational purposes.
We agree with the views expressed in last paragraph of your telegram and, wbile-we are most anxious to help, we have nothing to add to, or subtract from, the views expressed in our telegrams of 7th April 1932, 924, and of 27th July 1932, 1677, which clearly state the reasons that prompted us to press for the retention of bombing for police purposes.In any case, we consider it is essential to retain our general purpose machines of existing types.Telegram from Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretaryof State for India, dated 27th July 1932.1677. Your telegram of the 25th instant, 1964. Hostile lashkars seldom offer favourable target as they usually move by night, and, if by day, only in small parties, but not in formed bodies. They are consequently difficult to locate.. Moreover, it is practically impossible to distinguish friend from foe. On the other hand, villages of hostiles&quot; offer definite objectives which we can recognise, and bombing of which, after warning, deters hostiles, who are outside range of our columns, from joining in. Moreover, it provides us with means of meting out immediate punishment to sections who refuse to obey orders or who may turn treacherous. Bombing of villages has on more than one occasion succeeded in nipping incipient rising in the bud and in discouraging hostile faction. Your attention is also invited to our telegram of 7th April, 924. We have issued strict instructions prohibiting any kind of air action on western side of presumptive border.
