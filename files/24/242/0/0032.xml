Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.On 22nd March my colleagues agreed to the introduction of the Rubber Industry Bill into the House of Lords as a Government measure.      The Bill passed through that House without serious opposition, but differences of opinion have now arisen among the rubber manufacturers who formerly supported the Bill.      The present position is stated in the attached memorandum.This change of mind at the last moment on the part of many of the manufacturers is, in my view, very regrettable and not at all creditable to them, but I think at present our only course is to announce that we do not propose to proceed with the Bill in the House of Commons.      I should propose to do this in answer to a Parliamentary Question, and at the same time, to explain that many of the larger manufacturers have in recent weeks withdrawn their support from the Bill, but that efforts are being made, which we hope will be successful, to continue the work of the Research Association by means of voluntary subscriptions.I should add that the proposal for further State assistance in paragraph 5 of the Memorandum has not yet been submitted to, or agreed by, the Treasury.SECRET.CP. 182 (55).CAB I NET.RUBBER INDUSTRY BILL.W.R.Board of Trade.15th July, 1933.
RUBBER INDUSTRY BILL.1. On 22nd March it was decided to give an opportunity in the House of Lords for a discussion of the Rubber Industry Bill, which provides for the imposition of a levy on all raw rubber used in manufacture in the United Kingdom in order to provide funds for the Research Association of British Rubber Manufacturers.     At the same time the Bill, which was promoted &quot;by a Committee representing the trade organisations in the rubber industry, was supported by a very large proportion of the rubber manufacturers of the country, and it was hoped that discussion in the House of Lords would disclose the grounds on which any opposition to the Bill was based and enable any serious objection to be met.2. The Bill has been passed by the House of Lords without substantial opposition or amendment and is now waiting introduc-tion into the House of Commons.     When however the Bill was reaching its closing stages in the House of Lords, the Dunlop Rubber Company informed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade that they no longer supported the Bill and would feel bound to arrange for its passage in the House of Commons to be opposed.      The Lord President of the Council saw the Chairman of the Dunlop Rubber Company but the latter- maintained his opposition to the Bill.3. The Dunlop Rubber Company have hitherto been one of the strongest supporters of the Research Association and of the Bill. One reason they give for withdrawing their support now is that the work of the Resoarch Association has not been on a scale adequate to the needs of the industry and the Dunlop Rubber Company have therefore been forced to increase their own research establishment and have no expectation of obtaining any advantage from any further work of the Research Association.     In support of their opposition to a compulsory levy for research they refer also-2-
to the recent experiences of Dunlop Plantations Limited in -Malaya; that Company is compelled to subscribe, through a levy onthe production of rubber, to the Rubber Research Institute of Kuala Lumpur and recently the Institute has appointed a Committee to investigate certain patents.    The Committee does not include a representative of Dunlop Plantations Limited, but that Company fear that it proposes to attack their patent rights.4.    In order to ascertain the present views of the trade generally regarding the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary of the Board of Trade has seen the representatives of the main trade organisations.    Many of the larger manufacturers have now followed the lead of the Dunlop Rubber Company and have become opponents of the proposal for a compulsory levy.   A number of the smaller manufacturers warmly support the Bill but there is now little doubt that measured by rubber consumption ( and therefore by rate of contribution under the Bill) the industry generally are opposed to the main principle of the Bill.   As a result of listening to the statements made by the larger manufacturers and particularly those who spoke on behalf of the Dunlop Rubber Company, the Parliamentary Secretary informed those present that he would report that the manufacturers had supported the Bill until a few weeks ago and that they had now changed their opinion but did not wish to say anything as to their reasons for so doing.5.    The present supporters of the Bill (the smaller manufacturers) at a meeting on 6th July passed a resolution urging the Government to bring the Bill before the House of Commons, possibly in the hope that the Bill may be considered and submitted to the free vote of the House when the position of the smaller manufacturers could be ventilated.    They have also discussed the possibility of making some arrangement for the support of the Research Association by voluntary contributions from manufacturers.    It is clear that the larger manufacturers including the Dunlop Rubber Company have now finally withdrawn from the Research Association, but many of the smaller aunufac-turers have promised to increase their individual subscriptions
and there is some possibility of further help from the Rubber Growers Association..    In these circumstances the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research are considering whether further State assistance can be recommended on special terms, with Treasury approval, to secure the continuance of the Research Association during the next 5 years despite the attitude of the larger manufacturers which may be designed to deny to the smaller manufacturers the only means they have to benefit from i&apos;esearch work.    The Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research will recommend this course of action, unless the passage of the Rubber Industry Bill makes it unnecessary.
