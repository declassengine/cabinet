SSC33T. C.P.155 (33),Copy No.3 8CAB I N E T. PORTUGUESE FLAG DISCRIMINATION. Memorandum by the President of the* Board of Trade.After many years of negotiation we concluded a commercial treaty with Portugal in 1914 which secured most-favoured -nation treatment for British goods in the Portuguese market, and so placed them on a footing of equality with the goods of our principal foreign competitors.   The Treaty extended on the Portuguese side to Portugal aid the adjacent islands, but not to the Portuguese Colonies.His Majesty&apos;s Government, as the price of securing most-favoured-nation treatment for British goods, engaged to recommend to Parliament to prohibit the importation into and sale in the United Kingdom of any wine or other liquor to which the description &quot;Port&quot; or &quot;Madeira&quot; is applied other than wine the produce of Portugal and of the Island of Madeira.    This undertaking was given effect to by the Anglo-Portuguese Commercial Treaty Acts, 1914 and 1916.(it was a principle of Portuguese commercial policy not to give most-favoured-nation treatment to the goods of any country which did not so protect Portuguese wine appellations).Portugal at that time also refused to concede national treatment to foreign shipping, and, consequently, in the Treaty, British shipping was accorded only most-favoured-nation rights.    The matter was, however, not one of practical importance at the time and we were concerned in the main to remove the discrimination against our manufactures   which was giving rise to much irritation.After the War, Portugal adopted a policy of out and out flag discri tinstion in order to maintain and extend her-1-
Mercantile Marine.     In pursuance of this policy, she (l) imposed heavier port dues in Portuguese ports on foreign than on Portuguese ships, and (2) granted preferential import and export duties on ell goods imported and exported in Portuguese vessels..     The rebate in the case of imports amounted to 10?* and in the case of exports to 90$ of the total duties.     In view of the highly protective character of the Portuguese Customs tariff, the accord of preferential duties on goods was the more serious of these measures.From 1997 onwards this discrimination against out) ships formed 3 subject of constant representations to the Portuguese Government.     Numerous complaints were received from our shipping interests that shippers were being forced to ship in Portuguese ships owing to the preferential treatment which goods so carried received in Portugal.Apart from the practical effects of the discrimination, the question was important on grounds of general principle. The old form of flag discrimination had been abandoned by every other country, and the shipping interests feared that if it were allowed to survive in any part of the world it might be adopted again by other countries, such as the United States, with more disastrous results to our shipping.Me were not in a good position to press the Portuguese Government to abandon their policy since:-(1) Although it was arguable that the Portuguese action in some respects contravened the letter of our Treaty, it was by no means certain that this view would be taken by an inter-national court, seeing that we had, with our eyes open, concluded a treaty which (unlike our other commercial -treaties) did not secure national treatment for our shipping.(2) The only effective weapon we had w*s the threat to withdrew the protection given by the Anglo-Portuguese Commercial
Treaty Acts to Portuguese wines.     But the Portuguese wine industry is predominantly a British interest in which a largo amount of British capital is invested.As a result of strong representations by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon, the Portuguese Government issued decrees (1) abolishing the differential port dues and (2) abolishing the other and main form of flag discrimination in principle.       The differential rebate in favour of imports in Portuguese vessels has been reduced progressively from 10 to 6 per cent, in the case of imports and from 20 to 12 per cent, in the case of exports.After further representations, the Portuguese Government offered to remove flag discrimination in Portugal and the adjacent islands altogether in Juno, 1934, provided His Majesty&apos;s Government would continue the protection at,present given to Portuguese wines for a period of ten years from the date of the denunciation of the Anglo-xortuguese Commercial Treaty.     They refused,  -however, to make any concession in regard to the Portuguese Colonies,His Majesty1s Ambassador at Lisbon then pressed the Portuguese Government to abolish discrimination in the Colonies also on a definite date, and he Informed them that His Majesty&apos;s Government would find it difficult to enter into a binding agreement for so long a period.Further discussions have taken place, and I am informed that the Portuguese Government are now prepared to abolish discrimination in Portugal and the adjacent islands in June 1934, and in the Portuguese Colonies in Juno 1936, provided that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give an undertaking to maintain the present protection of Portuguese wines for a period of five years from the second data, i,e,, until June 1941,I would recommend to err colleagues the acceptance of
this compromise.   We shall by it secure the complete abolition of the discrimination against British ships in Portugal in a year&apos;s time without having recourse to the denunciation of the Treaty and thereby jeopardising important British interests.The Portuguese offer, moreover, carries with it the eventual abolition of discrimination in the Portuguese Colonies in three years&apos; time.    The Colonial discrimination has existed for many years and its practical effect has, I am informed, not been serious for our shipping, though I attach considerable importance on grounds of principle to the complete removal of every form of flag discrimination.   It is, in my view, satisfactory in all the circumstances, to have obtained the assent of the Portuguese Government to its removal in a period of three years.   As I have explained, the Portuguese Colonies are not covered by the Treaty of 1914.As for the concession asked for by the Portuguese Government, it is no part of our policy to reverse the principles of the Treaty Acts which prohibit the misuse of the descriptions &quot;Port&quot; and &quot;Madeira&quot;, since these provisions make for fair trading.W.R.d of Trade, Oth June, 1933.
