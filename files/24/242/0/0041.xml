&amp; fj 6,I R E T.191(55)COPY NO.CABINET.LAND SETTLEMENT (SCOTLAND). Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.81(35).The proposals of the Secretary of State for Scotland for a policy of land settlement expansion in Scotland,      to he financed out of borrowed money,,, were first discussed by the Trade and Employment Committee on 6th April,I then explained my objections to the proposal. It is an accerjted principle of our financial policy -that the State should only borrow for capital works of a directly productive nature, that is to say works that will yield a monetary return sufficient to meet interest and sinking fund on the capital borrowed.    Expenditure on land settlement does not satisfythese conditions.    Land Bettle-ment in Scotland has been seriously uneconomic in the past. The claim of the Secretary of State that the loss can be reduced to 10$, which is based on the assumption that it will be possible to withdraw the present landholder&apos;s tenure and increase the existing rent level by 25$, is to some extent speculative.    But even if the loss can be reduced as he claims land settlement will remain an uneconomic proposition.    I fear also that an expansionist -policy in Scotland of the kind proposed would have serious reactions in England.    We should not only have to face a demand for Exchequer borrowing for other works of an uneconomic character, but a widely extended programme of settlement in Scotland would ultimately lead to expansion in England and a demand by many English Local authorities,-1-
which would Toe difficult to resist, that the present discrimination in favour of Scotland should he discontinued and the whole cost of land settlement in England borne by the Exchequer.    An expenditure of  4,000,000 in Scotland, which is the estimated cost of the Scottish proposals would correspond to an expenditure of  33,000,000 in Great Britain.    In the present state of agriculture I am convinced that it would be a mistake to embark on a widely extended scheme of land settlement in England.Although,  therefore,  for these reasons,  I was unable to agree to the proposals made by the Secretary of State for Scotland,  I was anxious- to do  all that was possible to enable him to go some way to meet the growing demand for small holdings in Scotland, and it was arranged by the Trade and Employment Committee that I should discuss the matter further with him.The Secretary of State and I have discussed the matter on several occasions.    I was prepared to agree that the present vote provision of  100,000 to the Agriculture (Scotland)  Fund should be increased to  175,000, the maximum possible provision under existing legislation, and that it should continue for three years at this figure, so as to  enable the Secretary of State to undertake an extended programme for that period,  and test the claim that the uneconomic element in land settlement could be reduced to 10$.    This was, however,  not satisfactory to him and I have therefore offered to consider any further proposal which, even though it would entail legislation for some reasonable increase of vote provision, would not involve borrowing.    He has however not made any such-proposal .
I remain anxious to reach agreement with the Secretary of State on any proposal for an extended programme of land settlement  in Scotland, to he financed out of current votes,  of such size as is not likely to have undesirable reactions in England.    But I am satisfied that the objections to legislation enabling the Government to borrow for the purpose are,  in present circumstances, insuperable.(Initialled). N.C.Treasury Chambers,  S.W. 1. July 24th,  1933.
