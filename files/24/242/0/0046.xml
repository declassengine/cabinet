&apos; 9 ^ printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   July 1933.SECRET. Copy No.    2 4C.O.S. 312.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW AIR BASE IN CENTRAL IRAQ.(Previous Paper No. C.O.S. 311.)REPORT.AS a matter of urgency we considered, at the request of the Chief of the Air Staff, the question of the establishment of a new air base in Central Iraq and certain correspondence which had passed between the Secretary of State for Air and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in regard to the strategic implications of the Air Ministry&apos;s proposal.2. Under Article 5 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty (1930) the King of Iraq undertook &quot; to grant to His Britannic Majesty, for the duration of the Alliance, sites for air bases to be selected by His Britannic Majesty at or in the vicinity of Basra, and for an air base to be selected by His Britannic Majesty to the west of the Euphrates.&quot; By Article 1 of the Annexure to the Treaty, the British Government is under an obligation to withdraw its forces from Hinaidi-at present our main base in Iraq and from Mosul by five years from the date when the Treaty came into force, and the object of the words in italics above was to provide us with the right to construct a new base in lieu of those at Hinaidi and Mosul. A site for this purpose has now been.provided by the Iraq Government at Ethibban, which is &quot; to the west of the Euphrates &quot; and 50 miles from Baghdad, and, if the base is to be completed within five years, by which time the Treaty obliges us to evacuate Hinaidi, it is necessary that the preparation and construc-tion of an alternative cantonment to Hinaidi should be begun without delay.* The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked, however, that the&apos; scheme should receive a further endorsement from its strategical aspects before he could sanction the expenditure involved. Copies of the relevant extracts from the correspondence between the Secretary of State for Air and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are appended.3. The draft of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty was considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee in February 1930 (CCS. Paper No. 220) and they stated that in its existing form they had no observations to make. The draft had been prepared by the Colonial Office and envisaged the retention of our present base at Hinaidi. To that the Iraq Government took the strongest exception on political grounds, and the Treaty, as finally negotiated, provided for the removal of our forces from Hinaidi to a new base further from Baghdad.4.   The Treaty, as negotiated, was published in August 1930 and came into, force on the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations on the tsHSepteaafeer 1932.  In its final form it was taken note of by the Committee of Imperial Defence in March 1931 (C.I.D./252nd Meeting, Minute 19).   It again came before the* It is understood that if work is not started almost at once, the new base, if approved, cannot be completed within the time limit accepted in the Treaty, i.e., 1937.[8870] b
Committee of Imperial Defence in June 1932 (C.I.D./256th Meeting, Minute 2), in, connection with the issue of instructions regarding the control and use of the British forces in Iraq under the post-Treaty regime.5. In the correspondence between the Secretary of State for Air and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, particular reference was made to the question of communications. At the time when the Treaty was negotiated, it was expected that the Baghdad-Haifa railway project would materialise in conjunction with the Construction of the Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line, or, alternatively, failing a complete trans-desert line, a railway from Baghdad as far as Hit on the Euphrates, which would serve to bring pipe-line material to the junction point of the two pipe-lines, and, in addition, to open up a valuable commercial area.6. It was these expectations which, we understand, accounted for the non-commital reference to rail communications between Baghdad and the base which appears in paragraph 2 of a Note exchanged with the Iraq Government, dated the 19th August, 1930, which was appended to the Anglo-Iraq Treaty. &quot;If, upon the withdrawal of the forces of His Britannic Majesty from Hinaidi and MOsul . -. ... the Government of the United Kingdom shall decide to establish a British air base in the neighbourhood of Habbaniyah, then the Iraq Government shall take all possible steps at no cost to either Government to arrange for the construction of a railway to connect such air base with the railway system of Iraq.&quot;7. When it &quot;became apparent that a railway connecting the base with Baghdad was unlikely to materialise, either at all or at any rate in time to permit us to make use of it for the construction of the new base at Dhibban should it pe decided to construct it (which, according to the Treaty, must be completed by 1937), it became necessary to review the situation to determine what alternative communications would be necessary to supply such a base both under normal and abnormal circumstances.8. In the absence of a railway westward across the desert, the normal line of communication is from Baghdad to Basra. This line passes through some of the. most unsettled districts in Iraq and some alternative line, in the event of interruption, is essential.9. Both the War Office and the Air Ministry have recently circulated memoranda to the Committee of Imperial Defence upon the strategic aspect of a trans-desert railway (see C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1105-B, 1110-B, and C.I.D./258th Meeting, Minute 6). It is clear from the terms of those two Papers that both Departments see great advantages in a railway for moving troops into Iraq from the west, either in order to implement the terms of the 1930 Treaty by going to the assistance of Iraq in defence of her borders, or in order to protect the ever-growing British interests within the country in the event of internal disorder.10. The immediate question raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, therefore, is whether by moving the Air Force base from Hinaidi to Dhibban any strategic consideration arises which might alter the situation as it. is at present. So far as we can see, the removal of the Air Force base fifty miles to the west of Baghdad does not materially alter the general strategic situation, in that the only difference which arises is that a further fifty miles of lines of communication from the east are required. And so long as these fifty miles are relatively adequate we have no grounds of dissent from the proposal on this account. The Chief of &apos;the&apos; Air Staff has given us his assurance that he is satisfied that the road communications with Baghdad for the maintenance of the Air Force base are adequate and can be maintained, and that a railway, however valuable it might be from a general strategic point of view, is not essential to the lines of communication with the new base.  This view we are prepared to accept.II. There is, however, a further and broader aspect of this whole question, to which reference is made at the particular request of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. It will be recalled that the Cabinet decided.on the 18th August, 1921 (Cabinet 70 (21), Conclusion 5), to accept the Air Force scheme outlined by the Chief of the Air Staff, whereby the Military control of Iraq was transferred, from the&apos; Army to.the Air. Force authorities, anil that the then Secretary of State for
War recorded his dissent from this policy. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff wishes to emphasise that the General Staff have never wavered in their opinion that, under certain circumstances, the location of air forces in the centre of Iraq might represent a commitment which it would be difficult,. if. (not impossible, to fulfil. , , ;      i.The Chief of the Air Staff points out that under, the Treaty we are bound to assist Iraq against foreign aggression. We have also to protect ourbommunica-fcions across the Syrian Desert and Iraq, as well as to exert the moral influence referred to by Sir Francis Flumpbrvb, and mentioned in paragraph 15 of this paper.He considers that the attack most dangerous to Iraq would come from the Turks in the north and most likely from the Akhwan in the Southern Desert. To meet such obligations a Base in central Iraq is essential. The alternative would be the withdrawal of all forces to Basra, which will not enable us to do what is required of us.12. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff further explained that if at any time the situation were to arise requiring the despatch of troops to the assistance of the Royal Air Force in Iraq, an air base situated approximately 600 miles from the Mediterranean and 300 miles from Basra in the Persian Gulf could hardly be in a worse position. In other words, an air base situated in such an area is beyond the reach of assistance by land forces, except such comparatively small ones as can be sent by air.The Chief of the Air Staff, however, considers that the construction of the pipe-line across the Syrian Desert, which involves the laying of 120,000 tons of pipes, building of pumping stations, &amp;c, and the labour which must be permanently located along the line for the maintenance of the pumping stations on the pipe-line, shows that the reinforcement along the route from Transjordan or the withdrawal of the forces from Dhibban westward presents no insuperable difficulty.13. To cover the withdrawal of the air forces, or to protect them in face of. a hostile Iraq, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff considers would require a large force, which we are not at present in a position to provide, nor in present circumstances are we likely to be able to obtain it from India, as we did in 1920.14. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff also emphasised that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of competent observers, the situation in Iraq may seriously deteriorate as nationalist tendencies increase in the new State. He said that, for instance, the Mission attached to the Iraq army now consists of only 11 officers instead of 25 or more formerly employed, and he understood that there are definite indications of a desire on the part of certain sections in the country to reduce numbers still further.15. The Chief of the Air Staff suggests that the effect -of this will be to diminish the efficiency of the Iraq army, without necessarily increasing the risks to which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff has referred. He also draws our attention to the view expressed by Sir Francis Humphrys : &quot; I wish to emphasise as strongly as I am able that the success or failure of the new order of things, after Iraq has been admitted to the League, will largely depend on the moral influence which the Royal Air Force will continue to exert on a people naturally lawless and averse to the payment of taxes. The complete ivithdrawal of the Royal Air Force to Shaibah and their refusal to take any hand whatever in the maintenance of law and order woidd, in my opinion, inevitably plunge the coimtry into chaos before many years had passed.&quot; (Reference, C.I.D. Paper No. 1018-B, Appendix A. September 1930.)16. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has asked, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be made aware of the opinion of the General Staff, before finally proceeding with this project, that the retention of an air base at Dhibban constitutes a permanent, serious and definite commitment against our very limited resources.[8870] b 2
Conclusions.(i) We are of the opinion that in itself the transfer of the Royal Air Force base from Hinaidi to Dhibban, some 50 miles west of - Baghdad, involves no fundamental change in the existing strategical situation; the only difference arising being that the line of communication from the nearest port, e.g., Basra, is increased by some 50 miles.(ii) The Chief of the Air Staff is satisfied that communication with the proposed new base at Dhibban can be adequately maintained by means of the existing road, and that, however desirable the advent of a railway may be, on general strategic grounds, it is not essential from the; point of view of the maintenance of normal efficient communication with Dhibban. This view we are prepared to accept.(iii) On the wider strategic aspect, however, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff desires that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be made aware of the opinion of the General Staff before finally approving this project that the retention of an air base in Central Iraq constitutes a permanent, serious and definite commitment against our Very limited resources&apos;.(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.A.

ANNEX 1.:  V -1 . Treasury Chambers, ;My dear Secretary of State, &apos; , &apos; &apos; [ Whitehall, S.W., March 15, 1933. 1 ; I have been considering the -proposals officially put forward by the Air -Council in connection with&apos;the Central Iraq Air Base at Dhibban (S.: 30006/ Pt. II/S.6 of the 28th February, 1933). I have.already made some reference to this project in my letter to you of the 10th January which deals with:your Estimate for 1933. -;&apos;i,It appears to me that the Dhibbah project involves a major defence. commit-raent of a very unusual character, as to which we should, in any circumstances,, have the formal opinions of our professional advisers. Furthermore, I am advised that Sir Francis Humphrys is likely in the near future to lay before the -Government proposals in connection with a railway from Baghdad to: Haifa; I feel that there is an essential connection between these two proposals and that it would be unwise for us to go further in the matter before obtaining the, viewsof the Committee of Imperial Defence. .....I would therefore suggest that you should forward a paper to that Committee for consideration.IYours sincerely, (Signed) N. CHAMBERLAIN.The Most Hon. The Marquess of Londonderry, K.G., M.V.O.ANNEX 2.9 A my dear Chancellor, Air Ministry, March 25, 1933.Thank you for your letter of the 15th on the subject of the proposals put forward officially by the Air Council in connection with the central air base at Dhibban, Iraq.You are, of course, aware that the project is expressly provided for in the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930.While there is no doubt that the maintenance of British Forces in the territory of another Sovereign State is a defence commitment of a novel character, it is nevertheless one the implications of which were fully considered by our professional advisers before the Treaty was negotiated see the report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (Paper No. C.O.S. 220) on the memorandum of the then Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 45 (30)) covering the proposals for new Treaty which had been prepared in consultation with your own Department.The report of the Chiefs of Staff and the Memorandum of the Secretary of State for the Colonies were approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 26th February, 1930 (Cabinet 12 (30), Conclusion 6).The Treaty as finally negotiated by Sir Francis Humphrys, although its main conception remained unaltered, differed in some respects from the original proposals, and was accordingly again referred, with its subsidiary agreements, to the Committee of Imperial Defence in September 1930 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1018-B).Moreover, in June 1932 the matter was further brought before the Committee of Imperial Defence, when they considered the principles of employment of the Royal Air Force in Iraq on the coming into force of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1088-B and minutes of the 256th meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence).So far, therefore, as concerns the principle of the establishment of a Royal Air Force Base in the neighbourhood of Lake Habbaniya, I think you will agree that this question has already been fully considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence.As regards the Baghdad-Haifa railway, I circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 8th of this month a memorandum by the Air Staff on its
strategic aspects (C.I.D. Paper No. 1105-B), of which an advance copy was-specially sent to the Treasury in the light of what you said in your letter of the 10th January on this subject.This paper was prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence in fulfilment of an undertaking given to Sir Francis Humphrys last autumn, when he indicated that he hoped to be able to formulate proposals for the railway early this year, and wished for an authoritative opinion on its strategic value. It shows that, from the point of view of the Royal Air Force, the railway, although, desirable, cannot be regarded as a strategic necessity.I think this meets your point regarding the possibility of a connection between the two proposals, but if there are any Other points on which you would like information I need hardly say that I should be happy to supply it.Yours sincerely, (Signed) LONDONDERRY.ANNEX 3.Treasury Chambers, My dear Secretary of State, Whitehall, S.W., April 3, 1933.Thank you for your letter of the 25th March dealing with the Air Council&apos;s proposal for an Air Base at Dhibban. I am, of course, aware that the general implications of maintaining British Forces in Iraq were fully considered by the Cabinet, the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Chiefs of Staff in 1930 and onwards. It seems clear, however, from the reference which you quote that, at the time the Chiefs of Staff considered the draft proposals for a Treaty, the Air Staff contemplated retaining the existing Air Bases, and that, when the Treaty was signed and referred. to the Committee of Imperial Defence for information, it was certainly contemplated that if the Government decided to-establish a Base west of the Euphrates, railway connections at least with Bagdad would be required. Page 13 of Command Paper 3797, paragraph 2, of the notes exchanged with.the Iraq Government makes this abundantly clear.You are, however, now proposing that we should be content with road connections to secure the communications of the proposed base. I feel strongly that we should be on safer ground, as regards the commitment generally, if we had the further views of the Committee of Imperial Defence in the altered conditions which you contemplate. It would also seem to me convenient to have both the base and railway considered simultaneously when we have Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;s final view on the latter, which, I am given to understand, may be quite shortly.Yours sincerely, (Signed) N. CHAMBERLAIN.The Most Hon.The Marquess of Londonderry, K.G., M.V.O.o
