Note &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared in the Board of Trade on our trade negotiations with Finland.     These negotiations have been in progress since the 23rd May and agreement is now in sight.     I trust that my colleagues will gfve me authority to conclude an Agreement on the lines set out in that paper, subject to a satisfactory settlement of the out-standing points, none of which is of major importance.     I feel confident that the Agreement is one which I can commend to my colleagues.My colleagues may know that a special British Week, with a view to giving impetus to the sale of British goods, has been arranged to he held in Finland at the beginning of September I therefore hope that we may be in the position to have the Agreement actually signed before the end of August.W.R.Board of Trade.21st July, 1933.
fl fi r\ANGLO-FINNISH NEGOTIATIONS.MEMORANDUM PREPARED IN THE BOARD OF TRADE.Negotiations with the Finnish Delegation have been in px-ogress since the 23rd May and we are now within sight of an agreement.   This position has been reached with considerable difficulty.   At one stage it was necessary to tell the Delegation plainly that, unless they were able to improve very considerably on the concessions which they had offered with regard to important classes of United Kingdom goods, notably coal, textiles and herrings, His Majesty1 s Government would be unable to continue to grant them most-favoured-nation treatment, including the considerable advantages which this would secure to them as the result of the Treaties recently concluded with the Scandinavian countries.   The Finnish Delegation thereupon returned to Finland to consult with their own Government and have now come back with distinctly improved offers. The position is summarised in the following paragraphs;-General Trade Position.During recent years tho balance of trade with Finland has been heavily adverse to the United Kingdom as evidencedby the following figures:-		Imports into the United Kingdom from Finland.	United Kingdom exports (and re-exports) to Finland a		 1,000,000	 1,000,0001925-	27,(average) .. .	14.1	4.01928-	30        &quot;	,    13.6	3.61931	ii ...	11.3	1.8lfcSS	________:_____;J	11.7	20 6-1-
- fj Oo .Imports Into the United Kingdom from Finland consist principally of wood and wood products, paper and butter, and 85% of these imports are already covered by the concessions made in the Agreements with the Scandinavian countries which at present extend to Finland by virtue of the most-favoured-nation rights given under the existing Treaty.    It is reasonable and necessary that Finland should pay an adequate price for these benefits, but it is proposed, in return for the concessions by Finland which are enumerated below, to offer additional concessions on one or two products of special interest to Finland.I *    The Finnish Offer.Coal and Coke*The United Kingdom share in the Finnish market for coal was 96% in 1924, but by 1951 had fallen to 29%fo.    In 1932 our share h--d risen to 55^&apos;i which was still far from satisfactory. The Finns have offered a guarantee to obtain not less than 75% of their coal imports from the United Kingdom.   This represents, on 1931 figures, an increase of 400,000 tons. This offer is conditional on satisfactory assurances as to prices, etc. to he given by the United Kingdom Goal Industry.As regards coke, the United Kingdom share of the Finnish market fell from in 1934 to 34.7$ in 1932.    The Finnsfind special difficulty in guaranteeing a definite percentage but they offer a general undertaking to maintain ana&quot; increase the United Kingdom share of the market oncl a figure of at least 6C?6 is aimer] at. purchase se Agreeraents.The Finns have offered a definite undertaking on behalf of the principal importers that they will cover their imports
of wheat f lour by purchases in the- United kingdom at least in the same proportions as during recent years.   On the basis of this unde.rotrading, the annual purchases from the United Kingdom are not likely to fall below 30,000 tons a year. In view of the expected revival of American competition with the depreciation of the dollar, this undertaking is of great value to us.    Satisfactory arrangements have also been made with regard to the purchase by Finland of United Kingdom:j njte wrappers and cloth, commercial motor vehicles, salt and creosote.     Discussions are taking place with regard to iron and steel. China clay, papermakersV felts.r  .sulphate of alumina . and certain minor items, and it is hoped that as a result we shall obtain either definite purchase agreements or at least a general undertaking by certain Finnish industrial groups that they will obtain their requirements from the United kingdom. Tariff Concessions.The Finns have offered reductions of duty on goods the i-aports of which from the United Kingdom in 1931 were valued at 73,7 million marks, representing 16-.3$ of the total imports frov: the United Kingdom, -?nd consolidation of free entry or of existing low duties on goods the imports of which from the United Kingdom in 1931 were valued at 144 million marks or one-third of the total imports from the United Kingdom in that year.    The following are the most important items covered?-(i) Salted herrings.The present duty off 2 marks per kilo^ which was imposed in 1932 in order to protect the local industry, has killed our export trade entirely.    The Finns have offered to admit, during the first year of the Agreement, 1,000 tons from the United Kingdom at a duty of \ mark per kilo., and, during the second and subsequent years, 1,837 tons at a duty of 1 mark per kilo.    The specially low duty for the first year was suggested by United Kingdom interests with the object of enabling them to regain the footing which they had lost in the Finnish market. As the total consumption of herrings in Finland is only about 4,000 tons a year, this offer may be regarded as satisfactory.
Finnish specialities,     Plywood and throad reels aro made to(11) Co tton textilea,On medium weight bleached, dyed and printed piece goods, which are by far the most Important class in tho United Kingdom trade, the proaont duty is 18 marks por kilo.     The Finns have offered a reduction to 10,8 for wide printod goods (over 88 centimetres), 15 for. narrow printed goods and 15 for bleached and dyod goods,     Tho differenco in duty between the wide and the narrow prints has been strongly advocated by Lancashire cotton Interests on the ground that It will glvo an advantage to United Kingdom manufacturers In competition with their   Continental -rivals.     Proportionate reductions have boon offered on tho light weight cotton piece goods, and on mixtures&apos;of cotton and artificial silk, and here again a differentiation of duty according to tho width of the goods has boon obtained.     On cotton yarns and thread tho Finns have offered consolidation of the present low duties, subject to the right to consultation after two years if their   market should be flooded by cheap goods from countries other than the United Kingdom,(iii) Wool piece goods.The Finns have offered to reduce the present specific duties by about 15$ and to add a stipulation that the ad valorem incidence of the duties shall In no case exceed 30$.     They have also agreed to admit wool cloth with an admixture of 5$ silk at tho same rate as cloth of all wool. Tho United Kingdom Interests attach very great importance to the principles of the ad valorem stop and tho 5$ silk admixture.     On wool yarns the Finns have offered consolidation of thd   existing duties on tho same terms as for cotton yarns,(iv) Other goods.Reductions of duty havo also boon obtained on a number of other classes of goods of which the most Important are &apos; tinplatos and galvanised sheets;     small motor cars; motor-cycle tyres; gramo phones and records;    sev/ing machines; whetstones and grindstones;    asbestos goods; tallow;   and creosote.     The goods on which free entry or tho present duties aro to be consolidated Include coal and coke (free),, motor-cycles, linoldura, motor and cycle tyros and various classes of textiles.     Concessions have also boen obtained for certain Colonial produce including tea and bananas. The only important classes of goods not covered by a Tariff concosslon are wheat flour and sugar;   and wheat flour, as explained above, will be covered by a purchase agreement.II, THE UNITED KING-DOM OFFER. The United Kingdom dffor, as explained above, consists mainly in tho extension to Finland of the concessions already granted In the Agreements with Norway, Sweden and Denmark, In addition it is proposed to offer consolidation of the present 10$ duty on birch wood (hown or sawn) and on plywood of birch or of soft wood, together with a reduction of tho duty on woodon thread reels from 20$ to 15$,     All those are
a small extent in this country, but the interests of tho users of those goods arc considerably moroi important than tho interests of the producers,In tho addition it is proposed tdS^sffor tho Finns guarantees in respect of tho Imports of their agricultural produce on the sarao lines as the guarantees already givon to Sweden,     Broadly speaking, those ensure most-favourod-nation treatment, togothor with consultation before tho imposition of compulsory restrictions on imports.     In tho case of butter, a guarantee has boon offered that, in tho event of quantitative restrictions being imposod on irmoorts, the Finnish quota shall not be reduced below 195,000 cwts. a year, which represents a 10$ cut on the avorage Imports from Finland during the past three years (ondod 30th Juno),     The Delegation are pressing for a figure of 200,000 cwts. which is proportionate to the figure guaranteed in the Agreement with Sweden, and It may bo necessary In the end to agree to this.     The Finns are also pressing for certain concessions with rogard to paper and propose to supply further information on the subject;    but at prossnt It is not proposed to offor them anything which has not alroady boen given toiNurweiliVA. u no2ist July, 1935.
