THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT. SECRET copy NO.        4 0 3.P.199 (33).CABINET.ARGENTINE TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.As my colleagues will be aware negotiations are at present proceeding at Buenos Aires with a view to securing concessions from Argentina in tariff matters.     The agreement, which it is hoped to conclude on this subject will be supplementary to the Convention which was signed on the 1st May and came into force provisionally on that date.     The Convention accords us concessions with regard to remittances from Argentina to the United Kingdom and accords to Argentina certain safeguards with regard to our regulations of the importation of meat.     It is provided that this Convention may be denounced at any time after the 1st August if an agreement has not in the meantime been come to on the matter of tariffs.     I think: it is clear from the latest telegram (which I attach) from Buenos Aires that we shall have to allow a short extension of time after this date.The position of the tariff negotiations is that the Argentine Government are now showing signs of being rather more ready to accord substantial concessions than they were at the opening of the negotiations, but we have not yet secured the concessions which we require on certain classes of goods of paramount interest to our trade, notably textiles.     It may, therefore, be necessary in the near future, if we still fail to secure concessions which are substantial enough to satisfy us, to threaten the Argentine Government that we will terminate the existing Convention, and, in view of the fact that it will
not be possible to consult the Cabinet on the question, I ask my colleagues to give me authority, after consultation with the Prime Minister, or with the Lord President of the Council, if the Prime Minister is not available, to use thiB threat if I am satisfied that it is necessary.If authority to use the threat is delegated to me in this manner, it would, of course, follow that I should have authority under the same safeguards, to carry out the threat if it proved impossible to secure satisfaction in any other way.     The abrogation of the existing Convention would, however, be a very serious step from the point of view of this country, particularly in view of the exchange situation, and I have every hope that it would not be necessary to put it into operation.Should negotiations proceed satisfactorily, as I hope, I assume that I have the authority of my colleagues to authorise the signature of a Supplementary Agreement as soon as it appears that satisfactory terms have been arranged.W.R.Board of Trade,27th July,   1933.
From ARGENTINA.Decypher. Sir E. Macleay (Buenos Aires)&quot;.25th July, 1933.No. 168,My telegram No, 16G.Minister for Foreign Affairs askod me to call yesterday afternoon and at onco reforred to resignation of the Minister of Finance giving me to understand that this would facilitate tariff negotiations as he had always been opposed to convention.       I gathered that there had been conflict of views between the two Ministers and that President had decided in favour of Minister for Foreign affairs policy with the result that conduct of negotiations would now be in his hands.     This was confirmed by Minister for Foroign Affairs saying that he had arranged for withdrawal of customs experts from Argentine Itolegatlon and that Doctor Carcano should deal with these questions direct.Minister for Foroign Affairs proceeded to assure me that we should certainly come to a satisfactory agreement, the only difficulty being the shortage of time left for discussions.     He referred to inevitable delays at the outset and to Doctor Carcano&apos;s recent indisposition.     He was therefore compelled to ask for an extinsion of time of say 20 days or a month, or otherwise the Tariff Commission would bo rushed off their   feet.The
The impression I formed was that although Argentine Government hove decided to meet us in respect of our requests for tariff reductions, they wish to forestall adverse criticism in the Senate and outside by appearing to put up a fight in the cause of local industries.I replied that I would Inform you by telegraph of Mini sterns request regarding an extension of time but I felt that I must warn him that His Majesty&apos;a Government might be reluctant to concede it in view of the fact that the House of Commons would probably rise early in August for the summer recess and there were other reasons why a delay appeared to us undesirable.I had not received your telegram No. 129 when I had this interview.
