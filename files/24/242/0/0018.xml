t) 9CONEIDENTiAll APPRECIATION OF 1KB POLITICAL SITUATION IN i;SDIA DATED 21st June 1933,  ISSUED OH THE AUTHORITY OH THE SECRETARY OH STATE FOR INDIA.The view expressed in the last appreciation that Mr.GandhiTs dramatic fast created less general interest than the fast of September is confirmed by subsequent reports.      From Madras it is reported that it aroused practically-no interest outside Congress circles.    Even in the district of Bombay it is said to have generally fallen flat, while in Bengal,  though the progress and termination of the fast attracted some interest it caused no excitement apparently because its relationship to practical politics was obscure.     Similar reports have been received from other provinces.      In the North West Frontier province there was some feeling that   &quot;r. Gandhi &apos; a motive was the political absorption of the untouchables by the Hindu community and that he had procured his release in order to carry on what, from this point of view,  is regarded as anti-Muslim campaign.Since the suspension of civil disobedience, . Congress workers generally have been endeavouring to keep in the public eye by devoting themselves to the liar ij an movement, but in Bombay this uplifting work is said to have received little impetus, while in provinces,  such as the United Provinces,  and Bihar and Orissa, which are strong-holds of orthodoxy,   the demonstrations organised in support of the movement aroused strong resentment and, in some centres, breaches of the peace were narrowly averted.Though the daily bulletins issued during the progress of the fast showed that Mr Gandhi&apos;s condition gave
sono serious cause for anxiety, yet his recovery 1ms been slow and the most recent medical reports indicate that he must undergo complete rest for another month.    Mr.Aney has therefore continued the suspension of civil disobedience for a further period of six weeks solely on the ground of Mr. Gandhifs health.The present Congress leaders are clearly unwilling and,  indeed,  unable  to make any further move except at the dictation of Mr.Gandhi,  and he, when fit to deal with these problems, will be faced with the difficult task of reconciling the very divergent views of his former supporters,  some of whom would welcome a revival of the movement if only they could devise some new activity that would attract public support, while others would prefer an &quot;indefinite suspension&quot; as a means of getting rid of the incubus of civil disobedience and enabling Congress to start on other activities whereby they might recover their lost prestige and gain a dominating, or at least an influential, position under the new constitution.        There is yet a third division;  Subhas Bose&apos;s revolt against Mr.Gandhi was mentioned last month; he has now gone a step further and in a recent speech in England openly announced the formation of a new organisation known as the Samyevadi sangha; he appears in fact to aim at combining the more extreme elements into a militant party to replace the non-violent Congress.It is useless to speculate as to what line Mr. Gandhi will take to reconcile these divergent views or to what extent he will succeed in solving the problems that confront him.Meanwhile the number of persons undergoing imprisonment for offences connected with the civil disobedience is steadily decreasing.      At the end of
March there were 12,6 39;    at the end of April the number had fallen to just under 11,000, while at the end of May there was a further marked fall to about 9,000. This is partly due to the policy that has been followed for some months, when c ire vans tance s permitted it, of releasing those of the rank and file who are not likely to take a further part in harmful activities.The campaign against terrorists in Bengal continues to make very satisfactory progress.      The arrest of some important absconders in Chittagong was briefly referred to  in the last appreciation; further reports show that the terrorists put up a determined resistance, but the operation was most efficiently carried out by the troops. The success was also largely due to the fact that an excellent intelligence system has been organised in the district.      Shortly after this some important arrests were made in Calcutta and on this occasion also the terrorists fired on the police.In recent months about 100 terrorist convicts have been sent to Andaman Islands to serve their sentences, as it was found that as long as they were kept in Indian jails there was serious risk of their getting in touch with conspirators outside, of impairing the discipline of the jails and even of effecting their escape.    Recently some 50 of these prisoners have started a hunger-strike, nominally because certain demands of no great &quot;Importance, put forward by them, have not been conceded,  but really with a view to defy jail discipline.    One prisoner died as a direct result of fast and, about the same time, 2
others died of pneumonia,  one it would seem from purely natural causes unaffected by the hunger-strike, on which he had barely embarked when pneumonia.developed;    in the case of the other,  there would have been a better chance of recovery had he not been weakened by his fast.  The strike has led to considerable agitation against the transportation of terrorist convicts to the Andaman Islands. Those who  support such agitation overlook entirely the serious crimes of which these convicts have been found guilty and reasons which make their detention in ordinary jails dangerous^     Even if   Government might be prepared to consider some of the grievances put forward,it is clearly not possible  to do  so when they are accompanied by open and concerted defiance of jail discipline.
