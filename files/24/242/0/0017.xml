Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   49CP. 167 (33).CABINET.FUTURE   PROCEDURE   OF   THE   DISARMAMENT   CONFERENCE.Record of a Conversation with Mr. Henderson.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.WITH reference to Cabinet 39 (33), Conclusion 1 (6), I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum prepared, at my request, by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, giving the record of a discussion with Mr. Henderson on the future procedure of the Disarmament Conference.J. S.Foreign Office, S.W. 1, June 22, 1933.Mr. HENDERSON, accompanied by M. Aghnides and Mr. Noel Baker, came by appointment to see me yesterday afternoon (the 20th June), to discuss the future procedure of the Disarmament Conference. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Dominions were present for the greater part of the meeting.Mr. HENDERSON explained that it had so far been impossible to initiate in London conversations on the subject of disarmament. More especially, it had proved impossible to secure an appointment with M. Daladier. In these circumstances it remained to be considered what could be done at the meetings of the Bureau, on the 27th June, and the General Commission, on the 3rd July.Mr. Henderson had seen Mr. Norman Davis last Saturday before the latter&apos;s departure for the United States. Mr. Henderson understood that Mr. Norman Davis could not be back in this country before about the 10th July, and in these circumstances he had enquired of Mr. Davis whether the latter did not think that it would be best to postpone the meetings referred to. Mr. Davis had replied that he would not favour simple postponement. He thought it would be possible to keep the General Commission going on throughout the month of July.In reply to an enquiry as to the actual questions with which the General Commission would occupy itself, Mr. Henderson explained that he thought that time could be saved by taking a second reading of a number of articles which were not really the subject of controversy. Further discussion elicited the fact that these would resolve themselves into certain of the articles relating to supervision and chemical warfare. It was pointed out to Mr. Henderson that although certain of these articles presented no real difficulty, there was little reality in discussing them whilst certain of the vital questions concerning even these points were left in abeyance.It was explained to Mr. Henderson that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt that there was a danger of the Conference relapsing into what the Prime Minister in his speech at Geneva had called &quot; compartmental discussion.&quot;   The British Draft[8763]
APPENDIX.,,- Disarmament Conference, i$$2.Ministerial Committee.Extract from Conclusions of a Meeting of the Committee, held in the Prime Ministers Room, House of Commons, on Monday, June 19, 1933, at 6-30 p.m..(Circulated with the authority of the Prime Minister.)&apos;Conclusions. &apos;&apos;- &quot;It was agreed (a) To ask the Foreign Secretary to draft a letter to Mr. Henderson, saying that it was understood he had come over to London in order to try and negotiate agreement on points of difficulty in connection with the United Kingdom Draft Convention, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to help him in every way possible to this end, and were ready to enter into any conversations which Mr. Henderson might be able to arrange at any time.(b) That the present procedure at Geneva, whereby discussion is centred on detail, besides being tactically difficult for us, ignores the fundamental differences between the respective policies of France and Germany, which are the crux of the whole problem which confronts the Disarmament Conference.(c) That the Draft Convention submitted to the Disarmament Conference by the United Kingdom Delegation represents not only a balanced plan, but also the maximum distance to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to go under present circumstances.(d) That the present tactics at Geneva, whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government are being asked to make concessions on isolated points in connection with their Draft Convention, will not only tend to unbalance the whole plan, but will do little, so far as can be seen at present, towards achieving final and complete agreement between Germany and France, but will rather tend to provide a convenient method by which the main issues can be avoided.(e) That we are not prepared to agree to alterations being made to isolated parts of our plan while the fundamental difficulties between France and Germany still remain, and that we would only be prepared to reconsider certain parts of this plan if and when it could be shown that France and Germany would be willing to sign a Convention, provided agreement was obtained from us to reconsider certain points.(/) That, on these grounds, and having regard to the fact that Mr. Henderson has come over to London charged with the task of initiating private conversations to try and achieve agreement on points of difficulty, he should be informed that, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, no further progress: at: the Conference is possible, unless agreement can be achieved-between France and Germany, and that the first task should be to get these two countries together, in private discussions. * .i(g) That it should be made clear to Mr. Henderson that we are prepared to assist in these conversations to the best of our ability, and to adopt the role of honest broker if this will be of any assistance.(h) That advantage should be taken of the presence of certain of the Dominion Prime Ministers and other high Dominion officials in this country for the World Economic Conference to have a general discussion in regard to the proceedings at Geneva; and that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should be asked to arrange for such a meeting.(i) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to initiate discussions with Mr. Dulles, in the absence of Mr. Norman Davis in America, in order to find out&quot;wlf&quot; t&quot;is&quot;th&quot;er American attitude in regard to questions of supervision, definition of the aggressor, and the pact of no resort to force. These discussions to be conducted, however, in the light of the conclusions recorded above. _
