Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933SECRET.CP. 154 (33).CABINET.PERSIAN GULF.Suggested Transfer of Responsibility for Persian Gulf Affairsfrom the Colonial Office.cMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.-IRAQ having now entered the League of Nations (as from the 3rd October, 1932) and become an independent State, I wish to raise the question of the correspondence and handling of affairs in regard to the Persian Gulf. In January 1921 a committee, presided over by Sir James Masterton-Smith, which had been set up by the Cabinet to consider Middle East Affairs, reported that,, while the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf should remain under the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should continue to be appointed by the Govern -ment of India, the Political Resident should at the same time be authorised to communicate direct with the Colonial Office on matters concerning the Arabian littoral; that the functions of the Government of India in respect of the Arabian littoral should be confined to administrative and purely local matters; that the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office should be obtained to any measures of political significance; and that the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Ibn Saud (who was then Amir of Nejd and Hasa) should be conducted exclusively by the new department (i.e., the Middle East Department, which it was proposed to set up in the Colonial Office) through the Political Resident in the first place.It was also recommended, as regards relations with the Kingdom of the Hejaz, that the channel of communication between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Hejaz Government should be still the Foreign Office, but that in all questions affecting purely Arab politics the Colonial Office should be regarded as the responsible British authority.The new Department in the Colonial Office was to become &quot; the responsible British authority on all matters relating to (a) administration and policy in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Aden; (6) policy in other Arab areas within the British sphere of influence; (c) the delimitation of boundaries between British spheres and the territories of independent Arab rulers; (d) all expenditure . . . .. which may fall upon Imperial funds as a result of British responsibility for an interest in the areas concerned.&quot;2. These recommendations were adopted by the Cabinet of the day in February 1921 (Cabinet 7 (21)) subject to the concurrence of the Government of India. Formal approval has not been given by that Government, but they agreed to work provisionally on the lines recommended by the Committee. Effect was given to the recommendations accordingly, although for some considerable time the High Commissioner for Iraq remained the channel of communication with Ibn Saud; this was on personal grounds in view of the close friendship between Ibn. Saud and Sir Percy Cox, the then High Commissioner. Subsequently, in 1924 the Resident in the Persian Gulf was informed that he was directly responsible to the Government of India for the internal administra-tion of all the States on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, including Kuwait,[8713]Copy No.    40/
Bahrein, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat; but, on the other hand, he was responsible to, and should correspond direct with, the Colonial Office on all matters which might react on Arab politics in general (including Iraq) and upon His Majesty&apos;,s Government&apos;s relations with Ibn Saud in particular.3. As regards the development of oil resources on the Arab littoral of the Gulf, it was arranged in agreement with the India Office that, for the sake of convenience, this subject should be dealt with primarily by the Colonial Office, which was the Department responsible for dealing with oil in relation to Iraq.4. Circumstances have changed since these decisions were taken, and in my opinion it is now unnecessary and indeed inappropriate that the Colonial Office should have any responsibility for affairs in the Persian Gulf. The Kingdom of the Hejaz has ceased to exist as a separate entity, and Ibn Saud now rules practically the whole of Arabia; correspondence with him is conducted through the diplomatic channel, viz., the Foreign Office and His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda, and the Resident in the Persian Gulf is only authorised to communicate with him on urgent matters where delay would be dangerous, and then must keep His Majesty&apos;s Minister informed immediately. Our relations with Iraq henceforth fall to be dealt with also by the Foreign Office, and the Colonial Office interest in the relations between that country and the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, e.g., Kuwait, now ceases. Nor has the Colonial Office any interest in the administration of the States on the Arabian littoral of the Gulf as such.5. In short, the argument in favour of the Colonial Office assuming part responsibility in respect of Persian Gulf affairs has disappeared, and I ,Tecommendthat my Department should now be relieved of this responsibility.In that event the work would presumably pass either to the Foreign Office i&apos;ov to the India Office; but I leave it to the Cabinet to decide which of these ^Departments should take over from the Colonial Office.J P.
