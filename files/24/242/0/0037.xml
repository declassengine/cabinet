RET,1^87(33)COPY NOCABINET. Commercial Negotiations with Foreign Countries,, Note by the President of the Board of Trade.I attach a longer memorandum on the subject of our programme of future commercial negotiations.If our future negotiations are to prove successful, it isnecessary to undertake, as we undertook in the case of our formernegotiations, lengthy and detailed preparation, which involves somemonths&apos; work for the Board of Trade.     It is therefore necessary todecide some time beforehand on the countries with whom we willnegotiate, and, once we have decided, to concentrate our energies on those countries alone and to ptit off requests from other countries that we should give them a better place in the queue.As I shall not be able to be present at the meeting of theCabinet, owing to my duties as Minister in Attendance, I shall nothave the opportunity of explaining my proposals to my colleagues, andthe attached memorandum has therefore been drawn up in some detail andexplains at length the reasons for the programme which I suggest.Next Wednesday*s meeting will probably also be the last neetingbefore we separate, and it is very desirable that I should have mycolleagues&apos; approval, in order that the lengthy work of preparationmay be put in hand forthwith.The programme which I suggest is as followsj-(1) In the autumn, Esthonia, Latvia, and probably Lithuania.(2) Poland later in the year, when our preparations are complete.(3) Preparations for negotiations with Spain and Uruguay, on the understanding that it will not be possible to begin actual negotiations for some months.(4) Preparations for negotiations with Egypt, in case it is found desirable to negotiate with her.(5) The possibility of negotiations with Holland to be borne in mind.(6) France and Germany to be ruled out, unless unforeseen circumstances arise, of Trade, w pt July, 1933. *
COMMERCIAL BEO0TIATI0H5 WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. Memorandum by tlie President of the Board of Trade.1*   As my oolleagues are aware, the Board of Trade have in the past year been occupied, in oo-oparatlon with the other Departments concerned, in commercial negotiations with foreign countries.     These negotiations have resulted in general trade agreements with Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in a limited agreement with Germany oovering, on our side, exports of coal and colas to that country, and in a preliminary agreement with Argentina, covering, on our side, questions of exohange oontrol and the unfreezing of frozen credits.   This last agreement is to be supplemented by a further agreement now being negotiated in Buenos Aires which will deal with the Argentine tariff as it affects imports from the United Kingdom. Negotiations are also proceeding with Finland which, it is hoped, will result very shortly in the conclusion of a general trade agreement between the two countries.In addition to the above formal negotiations, certain conversations have been held with the representatives of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Uruguay, countries which, though happy in the possession of the United Kingdom as an Important (in some cases all-important) market for their produce, have not been content quietly to enjoy that position, but have been urgently desirous of commercial negotiations. The conversations which have taken place with these countries were merely of a general nature (it being impossible to conduct detailed negotiations with more countries than the six whose delegations were in London in the early part of this year) but where we thought it desirable to be specific, as we did in the oase of the United Kingdom herring trade with Estonia and Latvia, we were able to obtain immediate satisfaction for our demands.
x J7 tJ2e   We ere, of course/&apos; c-ommitted to a policy-of bilateral commercial negotiations with foreign_.countries.es, and I now de^Lre -to obtain from my colleagues guidance as to those countries with which we should, agree to open full negotiations in the near future,,   The two principal facts which should, I think, guide our choice are that (l) we shall he in a strong position in negotiating with countries whose balanoe of trade with us is favourable to them, and (2) negotiations with countries whose economy is complementary to our own (ice8 which are largely op mainly interested in the export of raw materials or foodstuffs to the United kingdom) offer the greatest prospect of success and will require the minimum of concession on our part8   The attached table shows for those countries with whiuh the United Kingdom had in 1931 an adverse balance of trade the percentage of our imports in that year represented by articles classed in the United Kingdom Trade Returns as wholly or mainly manufactured, and this may he taken as a rough indication of the extent to which the economy of those countries is complementary to that of the United   Kingdom,    Similar percentages cannot be given for later periods but the table includes import and export figures and the balance of trade for 1932 and the first quarter of 19539   As indicated in the Remarks Column the imports classified as &quot;Manufactured&quot; include, in a few cases, large amounts of refined petroleum, and, in the case of Chile, copper bars and sodium nitrate, which should be excluded for the present purpose.     Bearing this in mind and selecting countries with less than half of their Imports into this country classed as &quot;manufactures&quot; we get the following as fulfilling on the figures of 1931 the conditions suggested above:-   Russia, the three Baltic States, Poland, Holland, Portugal* Spain, RoumanJLa, iigypt, Persia, the U.S.A., Cuba, Mexico, Costa Tica, Peru, Ghile, Brazil&apos;&apos; Uruguay and Bolivia. (For those countries marked with an asterisk, the adverse balance has since 1931 been turned into a favourable one)*
3.    Of the Central and South American countries- enumerated above there seems to me to be, either on grounds of unimportance or absence of stability, no question of negotiations with any except Uruguay and Brazil,and of the two I should prefar Uruguay.      In 1932 the balance of trade with Brazil has turned substantially in our favour and we shall find difficulties in negotiating with her arising from the fact that this country is not a market for Brazilian coffee, and, under the Ottawa arrangements, Brazilian oranges are penalised as compared with South African oranges.   Moreover, the Uruguayan Minister, with whom a meeting as a preliminary to detailed negotiations has already taken place,  is understood to be very favourably disposed towards the grant of concessions to the United Kingdom, and it is desirable to profit by the fact that he is about to become Minister of Finance.     Of the other countries mentioned the U.S.A. offers special difficulties.4. Portugual would probably demand concessions in regard to the treatment of port which we should be unable to accord, and Roumania and Persia offer no special attractions.     We are already in negotiation with Russia.   Not only are we more or less committed to negotiations with the three Baltic countries and Poland   but the necessary technical preparations in my -Department have been begun in the case of Poland and are fairly well advanced in the case of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. There is a special reason for early negotiations with Poland since the new Polish tariff, with greatly increased duties on manufactured goods, comes Into force in October next.     The recent discussions with Lithuania have shown the desirability of giving no pledge to negotiate with her say for another two months, during which the effect on United Kingdom trade of recant increases of the Lithuanian tariff are to be tested, Lithuania is, in fact, on probation during this period, though it is likely enough that, as we can denounce our modus Vivendi with her at three months&apos; notice, she will   qualify
for full commercial negotiations &quot;by previous -ent-ing her recerrt tariff increases from diminisiilng her imports from the United Kingdom.5. There remain Holland, Spain and Egypt.    The low level of the Dutch tariff &quot;does not offer much scope for improving our position in that market; though the conversations now proceeding with Dutch interests on the subject of Japanese competition in Eastern markets might open the way to wider negotiations,   Spain is, however, a country which offers considerable scope for successful negotiations.    She is already a large market for United Kingdom goods, which could be developed, her tariff on our manufactures is high, whilst the importance of the United Kingdom as a market to her and the large favourable trade balance she possesses in her trade with the United Kingdom should lend weight to our case.   As regards Egypt, there would be distinct advantages from the commercial point of view in negotiating with that country, as there are a number of points on which we should like to obtain concessions, notably for our cotton and woollen piece goods. Prom the commercial point of view, however, it is difficult to see why Egypt should wish to negotiate with this country since her main export (raw cotton) to the United Kingdom enters free of duty and it must be obvious that in our own interests we are not likely to impose an import duty upon it.    There are, however, certain indications that the Egyptians may approach us with a request for commercial negotiations, and there may be, I understand, reasons of policy why such a request should not be refused.6. I therefore ask the approval of the Cabinet for the following programme of commercial negotiations with foreign countries(i) Negotiations to be opened with Pstonia and Latvia in the autumn and also with Lithuania subject, in the case of the last, to the special considerations referred to above.
(ii) Negotiations to be opened with Poland somewhatlater in the year on completion of the preparationswhich are now being made, (iii) Preparations for negotiations with Spain and Uruguayto be put in hand on the understanding that it willnot be possible to begin actual negotiations withthese countries for some months, (iv) Preparations to be undertaken for negotiations with egypt in the event of its being found desirable thatsuch negotiations should be opened, (v) The possibility of negotiations with Holland to beborne in mind in view of the present discussions in regard to Japanese competition. 7. My colleagues will observe that the above proposals do not cover Prance or Germany In any way.     Both these countries are of course highly industrialised and negotiations would amount largely to an endeavour by each party to beat down the tariff on the other manufactured products.     Any concessions which we might be forced to give in order to obtain an agreement would therefore arouse a maximum of opposition in this country.     In the case of Germany, the above considerations form a special reason for caution in opening commercial negotiations of a general character and I recently took the occasion of a conversation with the German Minister of Gommerce to inform him that negotiations were out of the question for at least six months.     With regard to Prance, there are other difficulties as well.     There is the 15 per cent,  surtax on United Kingdom goods imported into Prance, and the failure of the French Government to implement the secret undertaking recently given to abolish it. Moreover, we understand that the first point in the French case will be a demand for a relaxation of certain sanitary
.    193restrictions on the importation of vegetables from France, a demand to which, I understand, it would he out of the question for us to accede.     I therefore suggest that unless we find ourselves forced to embark on negotiations with France and Germany for reasons which cannot at the moment be foreseen, we should definitely eliminate such negotiations from our programme.21st July, 1933.Board   of Trade, S.W.I.
