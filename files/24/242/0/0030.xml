JjC RET., 180(33),CABINET,COPY NO.   3 1JUDGES    SAIARIES.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.1. On Monday, April 5th, 1933, the Attorney-Generalattended and informed the Cabinet that he had received a letter from Mr, Justice Macnaghten announcing his intention of presenting a Petition of Right against the legality of the cuts in Judges&apos; salaries, and that two other Judges might also present their own Petitions.      The Cabinet, after discussion, agreed: -(a) That there could be no question of restoring the Judges&apos; salaries, having regard to the disastrous effect that it would have on other classes of the community that had submitted to cuts in salary or pay.(b) That, if necessary, legislation should be introduced to validate the cuts in Judges&apos; salaries, whether such legislation was preceded by an enquiry by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council or not.(c)     That the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for War should see Mr. Justice Macnaghten and the other Judges concerned and inform them of the Government&apos;s intention as set forth above, so as to give them an opportunity, if they thought fit, of refraining from presenting their Petition of Right,      (Cabinet 23 (33), Conclusion 1).2. Mr. Justice Macnaghten further asked me to place hiscontentions as set out in a letter, dated April 10th 1933, before my colleagues.      The letter is attached to this document as Appendix &quot;A&quot;.
3. The other Judges in question are Mr.  Justice Glausonand Mr.  Justice Luxmoore, who are acting now with Mr.  Justice Macnaghten.4. Lord Hailsham and I have seen these three Judges on several occasions.    They now say they are willing to make a voluntary surrender of their salaries equal in amount to the cut, and that their real grievance is that the action of the Government is not only unconstitutional but has lowered their prestige,  dignity and independence.5. Lord Hailsham and I have made every possible suggestion to them as to means whereby any supposed lowering of their prestige, dignity and independence could be put right,  either by means of a question and answer in Parliament, or a declaratory Act.      We have, however, not been able to satisfy them.6,, At our last meeting the Judges in question stated thatthey thought that the Cabinet did not appreciate their point of view and requested me to put before the Cabinet a memorandum (drawn up by them) setting out their contentions and a draft Bill which they desired to see passed.      Unless such a Bill were passed,  they were minded to go on with their Petitions of Right. The memorandum and the draft Bill, are attached to this document as Appendices &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; respectively.      They are somewhat technical, but their effect maybe stated as follows7. The Judges in question are willing to make a voluntarypayment equal to the cut,  and originally they told us  that the other Judges were also willing to do so.      They now say,  in paragraph 15 of their memorandum, &quot;We cannot speak for our brethren, but as we have stated above, many of them intimated a similar attitude to our own on the 31st March 1933, and we have no reason to doubt that they would take the same line on the purely financial question as we would&quot;.    A clause in their
proposed Bill enacts that the National Economy Act and the Order in Council shall not apply to them.8. With regard to the first of these points, I have reasonto believe that the three Judges are under a misapprehension. Some of their colleagues do not desire to take any further step in the matter.9. With regard to the s second point, the effect of theproposed Bill would be that the Government would be reversing a decision which they came to at the Cabinet meeting above referred to.      They would also be going against the opinion which they have received from the Law Officers of the Crown.10.      But the consequences of a final rupture with them might be extremely serious.    In that event, it is almost certain that the Judges will proceed with their Petitions of Right, and this in itself gives rise to grave difficulties, having regard to the fact that all members of the High Court of Justice are themselves affected and therefore unable to try the case,11.      Further the Judges are probably right in their contention that the Law Lords are not within the terms of the National Economy Act, and that the Order in Council, which purported to deprive them of one fifth of their salaries is in that respect ultra vires.12.      It will presumably therefore be necessary to proceed with the Bill which was contemplated in paragraph 1(b) above.    The effect of introducing such legislation, which is exactly the opposite of that which the Judges desired, may very likely be to cause the retirement of some of the Judges.      I cannot at present estimate how many of the Judges would be likely to take this course, but it is obvious that the retirement of even one or two would have a very unfortunate effect on the position of
the Judges in the country would give rise to very disagreeable consent.13. In these circumstances,  I think it desirable toconsider whether some further effort should not be made to readiness,.: a settlement, and for this purpose to make an offer to the three Judges with whom we nave been in communication. We might propose to thorn that they should test their own suggestion.that the Judges sheaid sign an undertaking to submit voluntarily to a reduction of salary equal to the amount imposed by the Order in Council;      offering on our part, that if they obtain the signatures of their colleagues, the Government should introduce a Bill relieving them from the compulsion imposed by the Act and the Order in Council, and at the same time containing such recitals as would make it clear that the independence of the Judges was unimpaired by what had been done in the past and remained for the future as it was before the passing of the Economy Act.14. It is improbable that the Judges would succeed   in thiattempt;      and if they did succeed the Bill, to be introduced could not be in the precise form submitted by Mr.  Justice Clausen and Mr.  Justice Luxmoore,      But such a course of action would at least snow that the Government were willing and anxious to go to the extreme limit of concession and if the negotiations broke down, the break-down would be due to the inability of the Judges to carry out what is 0bvi.0usl.3r an essential part of the terms.15. .        I bring the matter therefore before the Cabinet so that I may obtain the decision of my colleagues on the
(Int.Id.)  S.OUSE of LORDS,   S.W.1., 12th July, 1933.question whether :-l)    We should now inform the three Judges that we are unable to take any further step in the matter;      or )    We should invite them to obtain the signatures of all their colleagues, informing them at the same time that if they do so, we will proceed with such legislation as I have described.
APPENDIX A.Royal Courts of Justice, Strand,W.C.2.10th Apr:&apos;:l935,Dear Lord Chancellor,I duly reported to Clauson and Luxmoore the conversation which I had with you and Lord Hailshara on Wednesday last, when you were good enough to say that you would read and consider the case submitted to my counsel - Hubert Hull - and his opinion thereon and suggested that in the meantime I should withhold my Petition of Right and they should defer taking the opinion of Wilfred Greene and Stuart-Bevan.They both readily assented to this suggestion and -as you know - I was  just in time to stop the presentation of my Petition and, with the approval of Avory, I have done so.Let me re-state the position - as we see it - so that there may be no misunderstanding as to the object we have in view.We claim that by virtue of the Act of Settlement and the unbroken constitutional usage, which has prevailed for more than 200 years, the Judges of the High Court, as the immediate successors of the Judges of the Superior Courts at Westminster,  are absolutely Iindependent of the Crown or Executive Government; and that this unique position in the constitution has been entrusted to them not for their own   benefit or advantage but for the benefit and advantage of the whole of the people of England and cannot therefore be surrendered voluntarily.The supremacy of Parliament is unquestioned: nevertheless Ito reduce the salaries of the existing Judges without their consent pould - it must be admitted - be a grave departure from the long-established constitutional usage - and to attempt to do so by
classifying the Judges with the Executive Officers of the Crown ignores entirely their constitutional status.    It seems to us that the necessary implication from the view,  said to be held bythe Law Officers of the Crown,  is that the supposed independence of the Judges has become a baseless fiction and that the Judges are now to all intents and purposes on the same position as the civil servants.We therefore deem it our plain duty to take whatever steps that may be in our power to traverse that view of our status.So far as our salaries are concerned:- that is indeed a very trifling matter compared with the grave question whether the Judges really are independent of the Government.    In my very first letter, questioning the legality of the deduction from my salary, I stated that I intended in any event to contribute to the Treasury the net amount which had been withheld,  and you will remember that at the Council of the Judges Clauson expressed the same intention.    I am confident that if only their constitutional status is not infringed,  the other Judges will freely offer any abatement of their salaries which the needs of the country may require.    I therefore earnestly hope that on further consideration it will be recognised that the Judges of the High Court are not &quot;persons in His Majesty&apos;s Service&quot; within the meaning of the Economy Act 1931; and that they will then have the opportunity, which has hitherto been denied to them, of offering ex gratia whatever the Cabinet having regard to all the circumstances of the case may consider needful in the public interest.    The Judges - I feel sure - will not be slow to avail . themselves of that opportunity.Since - as I understand - the fact that I was about to present a Petition of Right has been brought to the notice of the Cabinet and there has been some misunderstanding as to my object in taking that course, I trust that you will think fit, when an
appropriate opportunity arises, to place this letter before them.Believe me,Yours very sincerely,(Signed)    MALCOLM M. MAC1TACHTSN.I have shown this letter to Clauson and Luxmoore and they ask me to say that it precisely reflects their views.M.M.M.
APPENDIX B.MBaaiOfiABDDk ad TO CO^oTITuglOlSiAL^OSDTjJjN OP THE JUDGES BY.  CLAPS ON ABD LUJp/iGOiiE J. J.In 1700 by the Act of Settlement Parliament declaredit &quot;to be requisite and necessary that some further provision &quot;be made for securing our laws and liberties&quot; and enacted that Judges&apos;  commissions be made &quot;during good behaviour&quot; and theirjudicial salaries were duly ascertained and established at the rates which prevailed in 1931.      The effect of a judge&apos;s commission being &quot;during good behaviour&quot; is that he can be removed from office only on an address presented by both Houses. On appointment he receives a grant, under the Great Seal,  of his office and of the emoluments appertaining to it, and thus becomes entitled by law, until removed from office, to be paid the established salary.      If the Lords oi the Treasury, without some specific fresh Act of Parliament, failed to pay the Judge&apos;s salary, tney would be acting illegally.2. Ordinary Civil Servants,  Soldiers,  Sailors,  etc., canbe dismissed by the Crown at any moment,  and have no right to any salaries or wages except such as, under a vote of the House of Commons, the Treasury choose to pay them.3. The Judiciary have accordingly a legal vested rightto their salaries, the others have not.      This vested right is given in order that the Judiciary may be wholly independent of the Legislative and Executive Power,  except as regards removal: it is given,  as the act of Settlement declares,  &quot;for securing our laws ana liberties&quot;.4. Parliament is of course omnipotent,  and can, if itpleases,  destroy tne particular form of &quot;securing our laws and liberties&quot; which was achieved by the Act of Settlement, and can abrogate the arrangements made thereunder lor protecting the independent constitutionai position of the Judiciary.salaries ascertained and established.By subsequent statutes
5. So far as we are aware no one at present has had any intention of affecting this independent constitutional position of the Judiciary.     But in 1S31 the Government determined that certain salaries (including those of the Judiciary)  should be cut:    and the fact was at the time overlooked by the Government that, while the cutting of other salaries was a mere question of policy ana finance, the cutting of Judicial Salaries involved an inroad upon the work,  achieved by the Act of Settlement,  of setting up the Judiciary.&quot;for securing our laws and liberties&quot; in an independent position.6. Tke particular language used in the Economy Act was intended by the Government to &quot;cut&quot; Judicial Salaries as well as the other salaries.      Per technical reasons, with which it is unnecessary here to deal, there is a serious question whether the language used was sufficient.     Many eminent lawyers are of opinion that the Economy Act was not effective to cut Judicial Salaries,  and that the Treasury has acted illegally in making the cut against those salaries7. Everyone seems to agree that this question must &quot;be cleared up.      The only step we,  as Judges,  can take to clear the question up is to present a Petition of Right.8. At a Council of Judges held on the 31st March, 1933,we, the writers of this memo ran.&quot;aim,  stated to the Lord Chancellor that we proposed to present such a petition: and we added that, before presenting the petition, we intended to write an open letter to him, pledging ourselves that, whether or not the petition succeeded, we would, while remaining on the Bench, place at the disposal of the Exchequer so much of our salaries as the First Lord of the Treasury might from time to time thimc it reasonable for us to give up, in view of the National Situation, and the &quot;cuts&quot; in the salaries of Government employees.
I J e9. At the same Council a number of the Judges spoke andintimated a similar willingness to make a voluntary cut.10.        On the lOth kay, 1933, the Lord Chancellor told us, the writers of this memorandum, that the Government pro-posed to deal with the question by legislation.      We have accordingly refrained from presenting our petition, as it is obviously useless to ask for a decision on the law, if the Government intend either to declare or alter the law by legislation.      We however intimated to the Lord Chancellor that unless legislation is introduced we must proceed with-our petition.11.        In conversation between the Lord Chancellor and the writers of this memorandum it was stated that the intended legislation might tame the form of an Act legalizing the cuts, notwithstanding the expressed willingness of our-selves and many or indeed most of our colleagues to make a voluntary contribution equal to the &quot;cat&quot;.      We venture to point out tnat that would mean that the Government would, quite deliberately and without even giving the Judges any opportunity of voluntarily submitting to make a contribution from their emoluments to the national needs, destroy or at least impair the independent constitutional position which the Nation, for its own protection, secured to the Judges by the Act of Settlement.12.       We venture to think that such a course would, be fraught with grave danger, and that ii we can suggest an alternative course it is our duty to do so.13.       The alternative course which we suggest is that the inevitable legislation should take the form of the draft Bill which we append.      Such a Bill puts an end to all
doubts and protects the constitutional position of the Judiciary so as to &quot;secure oar laws and liberties&quot;.14.        It is true that the result would be,, financially, to restore the &quot;cut&quot; incomes.      But so far as we personally are concerned we are prepared to give the Lord Chancellor an assurance,  such as we indicated on the 31st March, 1933, that we will contribute the &quot;cuts&quot; voluntarily to the Nation up to date,  and further,  so long as the Lord Chancellor for the time being tells us that in his view and that of the Government the national situation calls for the sacrifice.15.       Vve cannot speak for our brethren, but,  as we have stated above, many of them intimated a similar attitude to our own on the 31st March,  1933, and we have no reason to doubt that they would take the same line on the purely financial question as we do.A.

&apos; APPENDIX    G.DRAFT BILL PROPOSED BY GLAUSON &amp; LUXMOORE J.J.- &apos; .&apos;An Act to remove doubts as to the constitutional position and rights of persons holding certain high judicial offices.Whereas by the Act of Settlement (IS and 13 Wm.HI c.2) it was declared by Parliament to be requisite and necessary that some further provision be made for securing our laws and liberties and it was enacted that judges&apos;  commissions be made quamdiu se bene gesserint and their salaries ascertained and established.And whereas by divers statutes the salaries attached to the high judicial offices named in the first column of the Schedule hereto have been ascertained and established at the respective annual sums named opposite thereto in the second column of the same schedule.And whereas the several persons who hold the said offices hold the same during good behaviour subject to a power of removal by His Majesty on an address presented to His Majesty by both Houses of Parliament and. the;/ are by law and. by virtue of the grant to them by Letters Patent of their respective offices and of the emoluments appertaining thereto entitled during good behaviour to receive the salaries so ascertained and established as aforesaid.And whereas doubts have arisen whether the enactment of the National Economy Act 1931 and the mailing by His Majesty in Council on the 1st da:/ of October 1931 of an Order under the said Act have affected the independent constitutional position of persons holding the said high judicial offices and their right by law until lawfully removed from such offices to receive the respective salaries ascertained and established as aofresaid.And whereas it is of grave importance to His Majesty and to His people that the independent constitutional position of
persona holding the said high judicial offices should he protected.Be it enacted that:-1.
