Copy No.   ,        iC A B I NET. 81(33).1ajb...SgETIBMBHT.; (SCOTLAMP ). Memorandum,^y,mthe^Secretary of State for Scotland.The Cabinet on 24th May decided:-&quot;That the Secretary of State for Scotland should be authorised to work out the legislative powers he would require in.order to carry out the Scottish scheme of land settlementt but on the understanding that neither the Chancellor of the Exchequer nor the Cabinet are committed to the scheme.&quot;The Trade ...and Employment Committee at their meeting on July. 20th instructed me to oiroulate foi* consideration by the Cabinet a paper containing my proposals for a comprehensive scheme of land settlement in   Scotland, to be financed by borrowed money.In submitting these proposals I desire to put 3 points for consideration;    (1st) past experience;    (2nd) present nesd and demand;    and (3rd.) financial return to the State,(1)   Post-war land settlement has been criticised, with reason, on the ground that the coBt to the State was too great.     This cost was largely due to the formation of holdings of the nature of small farms.     .1 do not propose to continue the formation of this type of holding.     During the last mr. years the Department have been successfully experimenting with small intensive holdings of 8/lO acres, and I propose to concentrate on the creation of such holdings.At least 90% of the new smallholders are pro3pei-ous to the extent of meeting their present obligations and making a living. During th.s depression of the last few years the smallholders have more than he,ld their ,own side by .s,ide with the large farmer, -and at the present moment the small intensive holdings of 8/10 acres appear
to be really prosperous.     The products on which this type of holder chiefly depends, viz., eggs, poultry, fruit, vegetables and tomatoes, are protected by duties.     Pigs are protected by the quota scheme and producers will be further assisted by the intended reorganisation of bacon production and manufacture. Poultry keeping in Scotland is distinctly remunerative.     Small scale tomato growers are unquestionably prosperous.    Growers of raspberries and other bush fruit now operating under a protective tariff are obtaining remunerative prices.     The canning industry is opening up new prospects for vegetable as well as fruit growing.     It can be stated with confidence that even if the prices of agricultural commodities, do not rise, the small intensive holder will be in a more favourable position than any other grower.The scheme I have in view is to. develop the....idea of small intensive holdings which must be formed on land within easy reach of markets, and these-holdings should be let at market rents on Agriculture Holding Acts tenure (and not under Small Landholders&apos; Act tenure, under which rents were fixed by the Land Court).(2)   present Heed and Demand.   It is.admitted that even if, and when, trade improves to the maximum extent, there will remain a large number of persona who cannot be absorbed into employment in this oountry.     Emigration, when it gets going again, may provide an outlet for a portion, possibly a large portion, of this surplus, but it is unlikely that it can provide for all. This leaves a problem which it is necessary to solve.During the ten years previous to the war the male emigration from Scotland averaged 34,000 approximately each year and of these about 5-,000 came from the agricultural industry/
industry.      In 1931, the latest year for which figures are available, the corresponding figures were 1,600 and 200 respectively.During the same period the number of men employed in the coal and heavy industries in Scotland has shewn a serious decrease;    in the ooal trade alone, since 1913, the number of men employed has decreased from 139,000 to 02,000 - a reduction of 57,000 or 41 per cent.Scotland is thus faced with the complete stoppage of emigration and a sharp drop in the number of men employed in the heavy industries.The Department have t.o**day over 5,000 applicants for new holdings, and when new land is acquired for settlement large numbers of .add it ional applicants are always forthcoming.    Scotsmen, whether from town or oountry, have a keen desire to work on the land t and experience has shown that the most successful small (intensive) holders are men who have previously lived in towns. The soheme whioh I propose is to settle 6,000 persons on the land; the total capital expenditure, spread over a period of years, would be  4 million.(3)     Financial Bet urn to the. State.    Since last December building costs have been reduced.     The cost of a house .&amp;aid steading in December, 1932.. was  600;   to-day they are being erected for  430 - a reduction of  170 -* without lowering in any way the standard of accommodation in the house, which consists of four rooms, kitchenette, bathroom and lavatory.     The sirxe and design of the steading has been altered and slightly reduced.Bents,     I have interviewed a number of smallholders and, with my..advisers, am satisfied that they are prosperous, contented, and could pay an increased rent.     Bent is only one minor item in the smallholder&apos;s on cost charges.     For every  1 of rent paid by a man on an average small intensive holding
IS 4he seldom mp&amp;m&amp;m less (and in many cases more) than  6 on feeding gtuffs, manured and similar onoost yearly charges.The rentals proposed to fee charged represent about  23 per annum for house and steading, plus a charge for land varying from 25/- to 40/- per acre.     For typical holdings of about 0 acres the rent on this basis would he  39 compared with the present rent of  31, an average increase of rent of  8 per holding.     In view of the real prosperity of men working 8/10 acre holdings and the large numher of applicants for such holdings, I believe   this relatively small increase of ront can   &quot;be seoured. I should add that it will &quot;be necessary to make a small proportion of larger holdings if existing farm buildings are to he utilised economically;   and that the return on these larger unite (relatively few in number) will he lees favourable than from the smaller units.2dy intention is to let the holdings at rents which will represent a net return of 5%% on the coat of buildings, and sinking fund spread over 60 years, and 3$ on the cost of the land and Other equipment.     The loss to the State will thus &quot;be the difference &quot;between 3^; and Zfg on the purchase price of the lands, roads, etc., that ie,   per cent.The cost of the land, roads, etc, in the  4 Million Scheme for 5,000 settlerB ie estimated to he  1,875,000.     The loss of \ per cent, of this amount represents a yearly sum of  9,375, and if capitalised at 3*$, a loss of  267,000 on the  4 Million Scheme.       Allowing an ample margin on this figure, the capital loss for a holding costing  800 should not exceed  80.I propose that properties should &quot;be purchased for sub-division into small sized units, to be called &quot;productionholdings/
oldlngeK, of 5 to 10 acres for the intensive production of psrish-ables, especially vegetables, tomatoes, small fruit, flowers, pigs and poultry.     Operations would be mainly in the industrial belt; estates at reasonable prices can be secured.As the State to-day approves of the policy of spending borrowed money in towns for the purchase of land and the erection of houses, and further authorises County Councils in England to borrow money for land settlement in England, I suggest that no new departure would be involved in deciding to finance the Scottish Scheme of Land Settlement by borrowed money,I suggest that the Government should adopt the policy of encouraging the formation of small sized intensive holdings to the extent of 5,000 new holders as suitable laoid and tenants are forth-coming involving an expenditure of about four million pounds to be financed by Government borrowings.With regard to the legislative powers required to carry out the scheme, a very simple Bill would suffice.     The Department of Agriculture for Scotland already have adequate powers for the acquisition and adaptation of land for the purpose of small holdings, but Parliamentary authority for the provision of funds and the method of borrowing moneys and repayment thereof would be required,I suggest that the precedent of the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1910, should be followed under which the greater part of borrowings were repaid over periods of 80 and 60 years.    Such terms are, I submit, fully justified by the character of the operations.     My suggested legislation has &quot;been framed accordingly and I attach a draft Bill on these lines,X ask for the authority of the Cabinet to announce the adoption of an enlarged policy of land settlement in Scotland as outlined above,(ltd.)
