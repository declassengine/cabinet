RET. 178  (35)cabinet.ISL3 OF MAN CUSTOMS BILL.    19&quot;-3,Memorandum &quot;by the Financial Secretary to. the Treasury.(Circulated &quot;by direction of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.)A Bill confirming the Customs Resolutions of the Manx Legislature is passed annually.The Isle of Man lias a separate financial existence levying its own taxes and defraying its own expenditure.      In particular it is completely free as to Customs duties, subject to confirma-tion by the Imperial Parliament.      It would &quot;be unprecedented for Parliament to alter the duties.The effect of the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill is substantially to impose the same Customs Tariff as is in force in this    country in the case of goods chargeable with duties under enactments other than the Import Duties Act, /&quot;Duties under the latter Act are imposed in the Isle of Man by Statutory Order not requiring confirmation ex post facto by the Imperial Parliament^ In addition to confirming the outstanding Resolutions of the Manx Legislatxire the Bill gives effect to certain modifications in Customs Law which are required for administrative and technical reasons and have been agreed with the Isle of Man authorities.The Bill is practically formal and occupies little Parliament-ary time.    Authority is requested to introduce it and proceed with it    at once subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may be found necessary.(Intld.) L.
