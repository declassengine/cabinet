SECRET. Copy No.       45CP. 184 (33).CABINET.INDICATIONS OF GERMANY&apos;S DISREGARD OF PART V OFVERSAILLES TREATY.I AM very sorry to be going out of England just when the difficult question dealt with in the annexed memorandum (drawn up by the Foreign Office after consultation with the War Office, the Admiralty and the Air Ministry) comes up. The subject is so important, and the possible consequences of action so serious, that it must come before the Cabinet without delay.I have not found it easy to reach a view of my own as to what should be done. On the whole I hardly think that we could ignore these events altogether, for it appears that the Germans are deliberately trailing their coat to see whether i anyone dares to tread on it. Public opinion is at present so roused by German internal policy that it will not tolerate the idea of German rearmament. Moreover, the Germans are not ready to take violent action for years to come. I think I should be disposed to sound the Italians first of all, and I should expect that they would put some restraint on Berlin and very likely get a reassuring declaration made from that quarter. But it by no means follows that we ought to believe the reassurance when we get it.J SJuly 14, 1933.Memorandum on German Rearmament.At the beginning of June the situation of the Disarmament Conference was so uncertain that it was felt desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not be taken by surprise in the event of the question arising suddenly of demanding, or supporting the French Government in demanding, an investigation by the League of Nations under article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, on the ground that His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied, from information which they had received, that the military, naval and air clauses of the Treaty were being infringed. The Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry therefore tabulated the information in their possession regarding preparations for the rearmament of Germany, with a view to ascertain what part of that information could in fact be used in support of such a demand. The information thus supplied is summarised in Annex 1. It must be borne in mind that, if this information is to be used as material in support of an allegation that Germany is rearming, such allegation, when based (as will usually be the case) on information from secret sources, must be made in very general terms, so as not to reveal the secret sources, and cannot, if challenged, be supported by evidence.Two further developments have occurred since the three Service Departments tabulated their information. First, as a result of an alleged air raid over Berlin, the German Air Minister, in an interview to the United Press on the 23rd June, announced that he would do his utmost to be able to build at least one or two (police) aeroplanes. This was followed up by the Secretary of State in the German Air Ministry (i.e., the Permanent Head of the Ministry), on the 24th June, making, inter alia, the following statement: &quot;We therefore demand a rapid decision from the Disarmament Conference, and in no circumstances can6963   [8851] rPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1933.
we. admit further postponement of the question of equality of rights in the air or on land.&quot; Secondly, the air attache in Berlin, in recent, conversations, first with a high official of the German Air Ministry (Herr Bolle) on the 10th June and then with the Secretary of State of the Ministry himself on the 26th June, has: been told in so many words that the German Government were already engaged in building a military air force, and that they were on the point of committing some violent breach of the restrictions to which they were subjected by Treaty. The despatches from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Berlin, enclosing the air attaches reports on these conversations, are given in Annexes 2 and 3.3. Before examining what action, if any, is desirable in the situation described in the preceding paragraphs, it will be well to consider the various courses which the German Government&apos;may&apos;be contemplating :- (1) They may intend, while avoiding any official announcement, to proceed gradually to the general rearmament of Germany without making any particular attempt at secrecy or speed; the actual degree of rearmament at any given time depending on the progress made in the conversion of factories, on the amount of public funds available, and on other considerations of an internal order; (2) They may propose formally to invite the ex-Principal Allied Powers to enter into negotiations, in order that the agreements reached between the German Government and the Control Commissions for the execution of the military clauses of the Treaty, and more particularly the Air Agreement of 1926(1), concluded between the German Govern-ment and the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, should now be revised.   Thei German Government would by this revision be enabled to possess sucharmaments, particularly aircraft, as might be shown to be essential for Germany&apos;s public safety and security.   The German GovernmentI might propose that such revision should be provisional, pending either the conclusion of a general Disarmament Convention or. the abandon-ment of the negotiations for such a Convention. It is true that revision on these lines would leave untouched the fundamental restrictions imposed by the Treaty; but, on the other hand, it could be so ordered as to give Germany a great deal more latitude than at present in such matters as aviation, police and semi-military associations;(3) They may intend definitely to notify the other signatories of the Treaty of Versailles that they consider Germany to be absolved from the servitudes imposed by Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, on the ground that the proceedings of the Disarmament Conference have shown that other States do not intend to carry out their obligations as set out in the Preamble to that article, and that consequently they propose from henceforth to rearm to the extent to which they consider necessary for the safety of the State.4. In the circumstances the probability seems to be that the German Government will continue to proceed on course No. (1), provided that they are left alone and not forced into the open by having to answer enquiries or protests. In the first place, Herr Hitler for some time to come will have his hands entirely full with the internal problem of reorganising Germany. He is nearing the end of the political phase and presumably now he is about to enter the economic phase. While this process is going on it must be assumed that he will not wish to complicate his task by embarking upon an aggressive foreign policy; it is much more likely that he will wish to keep this in reserve against the time when the present emotional enthusiasm dies down and an injection of xenophobia is required in order to work it up afresh. Moreover, so long as he does not proceed to any overt act he is in a strong defensive position, since the ex-Allied Govern-ments will have to prove not merely that Germany is rearming, but (if public opinion is to be impressed) that the extent of her rearming constitutes a real international danger. Neither of these tasks would be at all easy in view of the nature of the material we have to rely upon for our information.5. Germany might, with advantage to herself, adopt course (2). It would give the lie to the present suspicion that Germany proposes to repudiate her(l) This agreement represented an attempt to define the conditions in which civil aviation might be carried on in Germany, regard being had to article 198 of the Treaty of Versailles, which forbids Germany to possess any military or naval air forces.
1 rLiTreaty obligations, and would put on the ex-Allied Governments the onus of refusing to take anything less than their pound of flesh. Moreover, a refusal to respond to the German Governments invitation to negotiate on even this limited basis would greatly strengthen Germany&apos;s tactical position when and if she were subsequently to decide on unilateral repudiation, for the German Government would be able to argue with a good deal of effect that they had tried their best to deal with the situation on a legal basis and that they had been rebuffed.6. It is difficult to see how the Germans could, in present circumstances, follow course No. (3) without putting themselves completely in the wrong. The situation would be different if they had manoeuvred an open breach by refusing to agree to the adjournment of the Disarmament Conference, or, when protesting against the adjournment (which they did) they had seized the occasion to argue that the Conference had broken down and had claimed on that ground the recovery of their liberty of action. But they have let this opportunity pass; and the fact that they have done so surely suggests that, if they intend to take this course at all, they will now wait till the reassembly of the Conference in the autumn and then choose for their ultimatum the moment when they can represent that the Conference has failed beyond hope of recovery.7. Assuming that the German Government, if left alone, take no overt action but continue to rearm quietly and slowly (course No. (1)), the following questions arise : (i) Should we make any commtmication to them?By the recent pronouncement of the German Government following on the fictitious air raid over Berlin, coupled with the frank confessions to our air attache, the German Government may be trying to create a situation in which some action on our part will give them the excuse to course No. (2) or conceivably even course No. (3). If so, any action on our part might precipitate a crisis in which at best the German Government might demand to negotiate a partial rearmament pending a general Disarmament Convention, and where at worst they might announce that they were rearming and intended to continue to rearm in open defiance of the Treaty. It is arguable that in such circumstances it would be preferable that we should let sleeping dogs lie, at any rate until the fate of the Disarmament Conference is settled, and not take any notice of the recent German official pronouncements.But it may equally, and indeed more probably, be held that the German Government by these pronouncements hope to test the point at which opposition begins and up to which concessions may be won,(2) or else to create a situation in which they can argue that we were aware of, and condoned, their rearmament, at any rate in matters of aviation. Such an argument might place us in an embarrassing position, not only with Germany, but also with France and Italy, if at some future date we are forced to arraign Germany before the League for violating Part V of the Treaty. The fact is that, whereas up to now we have condoned various infractions of Part V of the Treaty known to us from secret sources or press reports, a new situation has now arisen because for the first time we are faced with a more or less official admission that the German Government are rearming and intend to rearm. It is this fact that would seem to make some action on our part necessary, notwithstanding the evident risks of complications. It is understood, of course, that were the German Government to return reassuring answers to both our enquiries, we could scarcely flatter ourselves that those answers were the truth or that Germany had stopped rearming. In that event our gain would be that we should have safeguarded our position against the moment which, in default of a disarmament convention, cannot be far removed, when we shall have to decide if we will admit or oppose German rearmament.Lastly, if the German Government, and Hitler in particular, wish to beat a retreat they can easily do so without loss of face, since it only involves repudiating(2)In support of this view it is worth while mentioning that in April the French Government, acting alone, informed the German Government that they held the enrolment of the Nazi bands as auxiliary police to be contrary to the Treaty. The German Government apparently did not &quot; answer back,&quot; and a month later Hitler, in his Reichstag speech, announced that these auxiliary police would be disbanded by the end of the year..   &quot;[8851] b 2
a Junior Minister. For it is to be noticed that none of these provocative state-ments emanate from Hitler himself or even from his chief lieutenants. It is even possible that the Secretary of State for Air has been speaking irresponsibly and without the authority of his chiefs. He is a permanent official of the Air Ministry and is not to be confused with the responsible Minister, who is Goring.(ii) Should we confine ourselves to the special issue raised by Herr Goring&apos;spronouncements and the confidences of the German Secretary of State for Air made to our Air Attache; or should we take the opportunity of &apos; raising the other infractions of Part V of the Treaty ?Our information respecting the other infractions is incomplete and is largely based on secret reports, which, if quoted, could only be used in a very general and disguised manner. In these circumstances it is recommended that we should confine ourselves to the special issue mentioned above.(iii) What should be the exact form of the communication ?It is recommended that the statement should take the form of a communica-,tion by our Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires in Berlin to the German Government.    This communication should be to the effect-(1) That His Majesty&apos;s Government presume that the Air Ministers state-ment that he would &apos;&apos; do his utmost to be able to build at least one or two (police) aeroplanes,&quot; and the Secretary of State&apos;s pronouncement that &apos;&apos; we can in no circumstances admit further postponement of the question of equality of rights in the air or on land,&quot; do not imply an intention on the part of the German Government to rearm unilaterally, respecting which His Majesty&apos;s Governments views were stated in their communication to the German Government of September 1932.(2) That His Majesty&apos;s Government presume that Herr Bolle&apos;s statement to the British Air Attache in Berlin on the 10th June that Germany was manufacturing military aircraft is not correct.(3) That His Majesty&apos;s Government presume that the Secretary of State&apos;s interview with the British Air Attache on the 26th June does not mean that the German Government intend to take any action in violation of their Treaty obligations.(iv) Should our communication be a British communication only or should it bemade jointly with France and possibly Italy ?It would naturally carry more weight if the three Powers acted all together. The difficulties in the way of joint action at this stage are : (a) That the representation to the German Government must be largely basedon information given only to our air attache.(b) That if we invite French and Italian co-operation discussions and delayswill ensue, the French wishing probably to extend the scope of the representations, and the Italians wishing to limit and even to prevent them altogether.(c) That if we consult the French Government they will at once tell theirPress with all the consequent mischievous publicity and polemics.There is a good deal to be said, therefore, in our acting alone in the first place, it being understood that, if the German reply is unsatisfactory, the matter will become one for mutual consultation between, and joint action by, the three Powers. Meanwhile it would inform the French and Italian Governments of the action we are taking and of the views we hold.On the other hand, it is highly important from the point of view of European politics generally that we should associate not so much France but Italy at every stage and from the outset in all questions involving Germany&apos;s violation of any of her Treaty obligations. Only so can we make certain of Italy keeping on the right side and only so can we make use of the influence which Italy still believes she can exercise over the Nazi Government in Germany. To obtain this it is worth while to undergo a good deal of wasteful discussions and to risk the dangers of French leakages.  If we were to invite the co-operation of the French
Foreign Office, July 14, 1933.ROBERT VANSITTART.and Italian Governments it would probably be necessary that the joint representations to the German Government should have as their first pivotal point the published and recognised declarations of German officials after the bogus air raid, the conversations with our Air Attache being chiefly used as an illustration and confirmation of the known facts.8.   To sum up.   There would seem to be three courses available (a) To take no action.(b) To make enquiries of the German Government alone as suggested in (iii)of paragraph 7.(c) To invite the French and Italian Governments to join with us in making these enquiries, on the lines suggested at the end of (iv) in paragraph ft.^&apos;I am in favour of (c) for the reasons given in this memorandum.

It is not clear that compulsory labour service involves a breach of Treaty, but it should be noted that the Technical Committee of the Effectives Commission of the Disarmament Conference recommended that all physical and other training involving incorporation in permanent units should be prohibited.A articles 174 and 175 (Reichswehr Periods of Service).

Rumbold to Sir John Simon. (Received June 29.) (No. 632.   Confidential.)Sir, Berlin, June 27, 1933.I HAVE the honour to transmit to you the accompanying copies of three memoranda by the air attache to this Embassy. Copies have already been sent by Group Captain Herring to the Air Ministry.2. The interest of these reports lies not merely in their demonstration of the fact that Germany is building military aircraft, in anticipation of the revision of the air clauses of the Versailles Treaty. This is no new development, and has for some time been known to the competent Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as is shown in the memorandum enclosed in the Air Ministry&apos;s secret letter of the 20th March last (&quot; Germany,&quot; print section of the 24th March, section 6). The new factor in the situation is that the German air authorities now make little or no endeavour to conceal, in conversation with the air attache, the fact that this construction is taking place.I have, &amp;c.HORACE RUMBOLD.
Enclosure 1 in Annex 2.Interview with Rittmeister a. D. Bolle on June 10, 1933.(Secret.)RITTMEISTER a. D. BOLLE has been appointed Ministerialrat in the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, and has already handed over his duties as head of the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule land flying training to Dr. Ziegler, the former executive head of the Nazi flying movement, in order to take up the duties of personal assistant to Staatssekretar Milch, in which capacity he will deal with foreign attaches in place of Ministerialdirektor Fisch. The duties of the latter have grown so much under the new organisation that he is at last to be relieved of part of them.2. Rittmeister a. D. Bolle was a great deal more candid than his predecessors-cessor, Ministerialdirektor Fisch, has ever been, and my recent conversation with him threw official light on a wide field of subjects.3. In discussing a projected visit to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule at Braunschweig the types of aircraft in use at that school were mentioned, and I said that I hoped to - see the Arado 64 e&apos;s registered in the Nachrichten fur Luftfahrer as belonging to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule, Braunschweig, since I had been told they were two-seater medium-weight training aeroplanes. Bolle replied that except for two attempts at building two-seater aircraft some time ago, Arado&apos;s had never built anything other than high-powered military types of single-seaters, and that the 64 e was merely a modification of the Arado 64 a, or b, or c, that is a Siemens-Jupiter engined single-seater; but, he continued, none of them were at Braunschweig; the name of the Deutsche Verkehrsflieger-schule was only used on paper as the holder of such aircraft, many of which were actually housed at Rechlin, Travemiinde and Staaken in the Reichsverband&apos;s hangar accommodation at those places.4. I said that I was sorry that I should not see any at close quarters as the Arado 64&apos;s that had apparently been placed on the aerodrome at Warnemiinde a year ago for my inspection seemed to be quite interesting (see AA. No. 87/32 dated the 28th April). Bolle replied that those two had certainly not been placed there for me to see and their presence on the aerodrome during my visit had not only created the greatest stir but much unpleasantness for those responsible for the indiscretion. He went on to say that it was useless to try to keep the fact that Germany was arming in the air a secret; mistakes were bound to occur and it was inevitable that a rearmament programme such as that now in progress should become known.5. I remarked that while the building of military prototypes in Germany might possibly be considered of insufficient importance by the signatories of the Paris Air Agreement to justify a protest being lodged with the League of Nations, did he not think it was putting a certain strain on the other Governments&apos; patience to build military aircraft in series ? Bolle replied that the building of military prototypes had in fact not been thought particularly dangerous, as it was antici-pated that such an activity would not be considered of sufficient importance to justify a protest and this view had proved correct; as to the present building programme it was realised that a risk was being run, but he said that the number of service aircraft available plus those now being built made such a small total that they did not amount to a force of any consequence.6. I obtained the impression that/the German Government believes that its illegal activities in air matters are well known to the British Government, as indeed is hardly surprising considering the candour with which the British press deals with this subject, but I was unable to ascertain if the German Government held the view that the British Government was tacitly concurring in her air rearmament by having refrained from lodging any protest.J. H. HERRING, Group Captain,Air Attache.Berlin, June 19, 1933.
9177-Enclosure 2 in Annex 2.Single-Seater Fighters in Germany.DURING an air display at Tempelhof on the 18th June, 1933, I met for the first time the wife of an important German aeronautical official, who has been intimately connected with aviation in this country for many years. This lady did not appear to be very interested in the proceedings, and in an attempt at relieving the tedium I pointed to the new Heinkel and Junkers express postal aircraft and said: &quot;Those are two of the newest types in Germany.&quot; She turned slowly to her husband and, still slightly bored, said : &quot;Oh, those will be two of the new single-seater fighters, I suppose.&quot;J. H. HERRING, Group Captain,Air Attache.Berlin, June 20, 1933.Enclosure 3 in Annex 2.The Nazi Movement: Air Matters.I HAVE lately had the opportunity of some conversation with several members of the Nazi party, who, from their seniority in the party, now occupy responsible official or semi-official positions, and it has been interesting to observe with how much greater candour they are prepared to speak than were their predecessors.2. They appear to possess sufficient faith that their party will stand by them to permit of their discussing not only subjects which were previously treated as too secret to mention, but also the difficulties of their party and the character and conduct of its leaders.3. In air matters the policy of the Nazi party is to unify all German air interests under the direction of the Air Ministry, to guide the activities of each club, school, air line or factory along the route decided upon by the Air Ministry, so that German aviation shall be a force with which other nations possessing fighting air services will be compelled to reckon. In order the better to control those taking part in aviation the wearing of uniform is being widely encouraged since the discipline of a man in uniform has been found in Germany to be much superior to that of a man in civilian clothes.4. While centralisation is being carried out the details of the new organi-sation have not yet been decided and ideas on future policy are still largely in a state of flux. The heads of the various air departments freely admit that they are groping in the dark without much more than a general sense of direction, but they think German aviation will eventually become a large single-minded organisation, the various parts of which will work together harmoniously in the general plan of making Germany one of the most air-minded and strongest of nations in the air.5. The similarity of Hitlerism to bolshevism is becoming more obvious as time goes on and especially is this noticeable in the air. The free and independent development of private flying by individuals or clubs to which one is accustomed in England, has never obtained in Germany to anything like the same degree, and under the new regime control is to be exercised in every detail by the Air Ministry or Deutsche Luftsportverband so as to make it as certain as possible that all flying in Germany will serve the interests of the country according to the Nazi interpretation, as directly as possible.6. Propaganda on the subject of Germany&apos;s need of service aircraft has. increased since the advent of the Nazi regime, and not only was the fact that, service aircraft are being built in Germany admitted to me freely a short time ago by an important member of the Air Ministry, but it is apparently fairly widely known outside governmental circles. That service aircraft have been &apos;    [8851] &quot; c
ANNEX 3.Mr. Sen:ion to Sir John Simon. (Received July 7.) (No. 662.   Confidential.)Sir, Berlin, July 2, 1933.WITH reference to Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s despatch No. 632 of the 27th June, and his letter to Mr. Sargent of the same date, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the record of a conversation which the air attache to this Embassy had with the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in the German Air Ministry. It will be seen that the Under-Secretary, Herr Milch, went out of his way to impress upon Group Captain Herring the dissatisfaction of Germany with the statiis quo and the development of -a spirit which would shrink from no sacrifice in order to reassert her position in the world. Despite the fear and hatred of communism professed by the Nazi regime, Herr Milch referred to the old idea that if Germany could not get what she wanted from the Western Powers she would throw in her lot with Russia.2. Group Captain Herring believes that in regard to foreign questions Herr Milch has been, and doubtless remains, imbued with the feelings and doctrines of the old German National party. I understand also from the military attache to this Embassy that although the Reichswehr have some reason to be dissatisfied with the position to which they have been relegated by the present regime and with the conduct of Nazi supporters in many respects, the general feeling amongst officers remains sympathetic to national socialism and hopeful of the national results which may be achieved by its agency. While disapproving the excesses and remaining completely loyal to the Higher Command and the President, it is felt in Reiphswehr circles that it would be foolish to quarrel, merely on account of their ruthlessness, with measures intended to pave the way for the ^establishment of the military strength and greatness of Germany.3. Herr Hitler, in a speech to the S.A. leaders at Bad Reichenhall on the 1st July, defined the concrete aim of the National Socialist revolution to be : &quot; Internal order in preparation for the development of external force.&quot; This theme is being emphasised in the former Nationalist press. In an article in the Berlin Lokal-Anzeiger it is pointed out that &quot; it is not only the historical task of the German people to achieve to-day the complete unity of the State. Its much greater task is to secure the State against every danger for all time.&quot; The Tag says :  &quot; Totality means for us complete mobilisation under unified leadership,built in Germany for some years is also no longer kept secret, since at a recent national flying day at Tempelhof Aerodrome the Junkers A. 48, a low-wing high-performance two-seater fighter, some three years old, fitted with a 600 h.p. Siemens-Jupiter and painted dark grey-green colour, gave a display of aerobatics similar in every way to the demonstration of the service fighters of other countries.7. There is no doubt that the Nazi regime has placed German aviation on an altogether different and better footing from the Nazi point of view; a process of mobilisation is in progress, and when the attendant disorganisation is over it may be anticipated with confidence that all German aviation will remain a Government-controlled branch of the public life so long as the Nazi regime lasts. The appearance of a military air service would be unlikely to alter the character of the organisation now coming into being, for it is difficult to visualise Germany as content with the size of any of her fighting services, and she may, therefore, be counted on to retain the machinery she has been at such pains to perfect for establishing a supply of pilots, other personnel and aircraft against times of emergency.8. This machinery and its production capacity will, therefore, always have to be taken into account when attempting to assess Germany&apos;s strength in the air.J. H. HERRING, Group Captain,Air Attache.Berlin, June 21, 1933.x
and the essence of German socialism lies in calling up all Germans and in harnessing all the material and spiritual resources of the nation for the struggle for its existence.&quot; A writer in the Hamburger Nachrichten states -: By reasoning and arguing nothing is accomplished, the State can demand that every member puts himself into its-service as joyfully to-day as on the 1st August, 1914. . . External freedom must be won against a world of enemies; everything else is subordinate to this aim.&quot;4. In a leading article which appeared on the 5th July in Hitler&apos;s principal newspaper, the Vblkischer Beobachter, the following remarks are to be found :  &quot; In the liberalist epoch the army and the people were bound together in feeling but not in function. The structure of the State hindered the fusion of State, people and army into one military unit. It was only the victory of the National Socialist doctrine which put an end to that state of affairs. A Government led by soldier politicians tb-day guarantees a logical military policy (&apos; Wehrpolitik&apos;). Once the destruction of its internal enemies is completed the Government are determined to take all the legislative and propagandist measures necessary to create a real people&apos;s State of workers and soldiers, in which one-sided civilian or military interests will be unthinkable.&quot;5. The writer goes on to say that it will be the task of the universities and high schools &quot; to inculcate intellectual readiness to bear arms.&quot; The contempt of the savant for the apparatus of war has now found its end, just as has the stupid failure of many soldiers to recognise the intellectual foundations of home defence. The student, he continues, must be taught to face the real possibility of war, and look on a struggle as something unavoidable (&quot; Den Kampf als Schicksal begreifen&quot;). Above all, the writer concludes, one lesson must be taught, namely, that neglect of military matters in peace time has to be made good in blood when war eventually breaks out. If these lessons are taught &quot; no Finance Minister will henceforth be able to impose his veto conscientiously when the defence interests demand expenditure, and no economist will believe any longer in the myth that military expenditure is unproductive, nor will anybody fail- to understand that military service is the supreme duty of the citizen.&quot;6. If the Nationalist and Junker elements have failed to learn the folly of aggression from the lessons of the World War, it is all the more disappointing that a new movement embracing such a large proportion of the population and particularly of the youth of the nation, as national socialism, should apparently be equally if not more aggressive. For the time being, however, the elimination of so many of the more experienced and capable elements must have a weakening effect on Germany, and if the economic and social revolution recently forecast and since denied does materialise, the State may be further weakened for purposes of external aggression. As reported in paragraph 16 of Sir Ff. Rumbold&apos;s despatch No. 642 of the 30th June, Herr Goebbels has intimated that eight years of preparation will be necessary. Much will happen in that time, and if patriotic fervour is already being whipped up, it seems hardly possible that a pressure up to bursting-point can be maintained for so long. A dangerous instrument may, nevertheless, by then have been forged.I have, &amp;c.B. C. NEWTON.Enclosure in Annex 3. Conversation with Staatssekretar Milch on June 26, 1933.(Secret.)STAATSSEKRETAR MILCH, of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, invited me to lunch with him on Monday the 26th June, several days before the date and the recent incident of aircraft having dropped subversive literature over Berlin, as well as recent developments in air matters in Germany, made the prospect of conversation with him particularly interesting. In the event, however, air matters were hardly mentioned.
2. Staatssekretar Milch, his personal assistant, Ministerialrat Bolle, and I were the only persons present, and after the usual general topics of conversation had been disposed of, Staatssekretar Milch and Ministerialrat Bolle descrihed the unfavourable situation in Germany in detail; they insisted that the condition of Germany was due to the Peace Treaty and to the enmity which the rest of the world felt for her. While admitting the stupidity of various German statesmen, no German had ever, I gathered, done anything wrong nor had any German Government in the past been guilty of the smallest deviation from the straight and narrow path. Both Staatssekretar Milch and Ministerialrat Bolle laid great stress upon the undoubted fact that the German people do not now believe that Germany was responsible for the Great War, and starting from that point Staatssekretar Milch impressed upon me&apos;the fact that Germans felt themselves so unjustly treated that any one of them would be willing to sacrifice his life for Germany&apos;s freedom.3. I asked Staatssekretar Milch what he meant by freedom, to which he replied, the same freedom as England possessed, to which I replied that, in the case of England, the word freedom should be applied in as limited a sense as to any other country; England was bound by treaty obligations, her people were bound by laws that were strictly enforced, and it appeared to me that the German people would not feel very different if they were granted the freedom they now desired and used it in the way that the English people used it. Staatssekretar Milch said that the willingness to sacrifice their lives had led, in the case of private sporting pilots, to their having all of them agreed, or so I understood him to say, that in an emergency, if they were called upon to fly their light aircraft against enemies of the State, they would be willing to ram the opposing aircraft. I received the impression that this attitude on the part of the light aeroplane pilots might be the result of an oath that they took, and the attitude is at any rate a further indication that the light aeroplane movement in Germany has been considered as part of the country&apos;s defence organisation.4. Staatssekretar Milch was at pains to impress upon me the fact that the German people as a whole had reached such a state of revolt against the Peace Treaty that they were on the point of committing some violent breach of the restrictions to which they are subjected by it.5. In the course of the conversation, Staatssekretar Milch said that Germany was determined to play a leading role in the affairs of the world, but she was faced with the question of whether she would be the eastern boundary of M^estern civilisation, when she would be unlikely to play a leading role, or whether she should form the western bulwark of the Eastern civilisation, in which case she would certainly exercise a decisive influence over the destiny of a large slice of the world; he himself favoured the latter orientation and was undeterred by the possibility of danger from the Russian Communist regime.6. I formed the impression that I had been asked to listen to these reflections on Germany for the specific purpose of reporting their tenor as an indication of the probable actions of the German Government in the immediate future. Staatssekretar Milch expressed the hope that the conversation might be the fore-runner of others, as he felt that time spent in such a way was probably used to good advantage by both of us in helping towards an understanding of each other&apos;s point of view.J.
