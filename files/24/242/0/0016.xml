CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 166 (33).CABINET.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum which has been prepared in the Foreign Office regarding the present situation in Austria.J SJune 19, 1933.THE SITUATION IN AUSTRIA.The tense situation which at present exists in Austria is not so much due to any one incident as the result of a whole series of incidents which are themselves the product of the deep difference of outlook between a Germany ruled by the Nazis and an Austria where, as has been aptly remarked, everyone who is not a Roman Catholic is a Jew or a Socialist.I. Internal Situation.The Austrian Chancellor, Dr. Dollfuss, belongs to the Christian Socialist, i.e., Conservative, party. The Coalition Government which he heads, composed of the Christian Socialists, Fascist Heimwehr and Landbund (i.e., Peasant party), has no adequate working majority in the Austrian Parliament. The parliamentary Opposition consists, broadly speaking, of Social Democrats and pan-Germans, but the Austrian Parliament which was elected in 1930 is no longer a true reflection of Austrian opinion, which has to a considerable extent gone over to the Austrian National Socialist (Nazi) party, which is affiliated to the German National Socialists. It is not, however, possible at present to gauge accurately the strength of National Socialist opinion in Austria; suffice it to say that the Austrian Nazis are, like their German brethren, a most noisy and obstreperous minority.Since the economic crisis Austria&apos;s neighbours have to a large extent erected prohibitive vtrade barriers on all sides, and Austria&apos;s financial and economic position has therefore become very difficult. Dr. Dollfuss&apos;s policy has been to solve the financial difficulties by a policy of severe retrenchment and to strengthen the position of the currency with the aid of a further guaranteed loan, mainly for the purpose of consolidating the short-term advances made.to the Austrian Government and to the Austrian National Bank. In order to obtain this the budget had to be balanced, fresh taxation imposed, Austria&apos;s existing obligations had to be met, and, in general, many unpopular measures had to be undertaken. Unfortunately, Dr. Dollfuss&apos;s exiguous majority in the Austrian Parliament did not enable him to carry out all the necessary reforms.In March Dr. Dollfuss availed himself of a parliamentary deadlock to take the line that as Parliament had of its own volition refused to function, he was justified in governing the country by Emergency Decree in virtue of certain powers derived from wartime legislation. Since then a highly successful policy of financial retrenchment has been pursued. The budget has been more or less balanced; the exchange restrictions have been greatly eased as regards current trade; the currency position has been well held; and Austria&apos;s foreign loan obli-gations have been met.6931   [8754]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.
Dr. Dollfuss&apos;s object is to continue to rule until the National Socialists have d i sd red i tedj th em selves in&quot; German y (wh ic h he hopes will be spon) and to put oft&apos; holding new elections, till : then. In the meantime /he; is understood; to be. considering plans, for a new: Constitution including the functional; representation, of.trades and:professions&apos; in a new Chamber. , Conversely, the [Nazis naturally wish/tojhold:elections, as soon as possible while the tide of enthusiasm for herr Hitler still runs strong.. The Nazis are therefore out to make Dr, Dollf.uss&apos;s position,impossible, and Dr.Dollfuss, for his part, is put to keep the &quot;Nazi8 in ; oi^e^i^jiji^ifinQfl^g^Kt W^^^^pf-^^ii^Mz^i^V^jW^ioi; trouble.,r;7.The, Au&apos;strian&apos;: Socialists, for. their part, are somewhat divided between their dislike, of their brothers in opposition, the Nazis (with whom the Pan-Germans have thrown in their, lot), and of various measures recently introduced by Dr. Doll fuss by emergency procedure. Among the latter may be mentioned the reduction of bank salaries and pensions by decree; the dissolution of the &quot; Schutzbund,&quot; the semi-military organisation of the Social Democrat party; the enrolment of 15,000 auxiliary police, mostly from the Fascist Heimwehr; and certain measures reducing the amount accruing to the Socialist municipality of Vienna from the proceeds of federal taxation.II. The Austrian Loan.As has been shown the political situation is connected directly with the issue of the Austrian Loan which is to be guaranteed by the Governments of the countries where it is issued. The Austrian Loan Protocol provides for a loan up to 300 million Schillinge; actually only 246 million Schillinge have been promised, made up as follows : -MillionGreat Britain France... ItalyBelgium^)Netherlands^)Switzerland^)Total ...(1) Subject to legislative power to ratify being- obtained.Schillinge. 100 100 305 3246The British share is to be used entirely to repay to the Bank of England the outstanding portion of the short-term loan granted to Austria in 1931. The Loan Protocol has been ratified by His Majesty&apos;s Government and has entered into force, and the Austrian Loan Guarantee Bill has received the Royal Assent.Owing, however, in the main to two difficulties the loan has not yet been issued. The first difficulty is that the Treasury have no power to guarantee the new loan unless it conforms to the Loan Protocol of the 15th July, 1932, which was appended to the Austrian Loan Guarantee Bill. One of the provisions of the protocol was that the loan is.to be secured on the existing system of assigned revenues which is not at present in working order. The only solution of the difficulty is for the Austrians to use the proceeds of the new loan to restore the system of assigned revenues to working order by paying to the trustees of the 1923 Guaranteed Loan the sum of about 40 million Schillinge necessary to reconstitute the reserve fund. * It is hoped that the Austrian Government will accept this solution if they are convinced that it is the only possible one. But it will mean that the loan will produce no fresh money for Austria, since almost the whole of the proceeds will be needed to repay the short-term advances of the Bank,of. England/and&apos; Bank &quot;ior International Settlements and to reconstitute the Reserve Fund of the 1923 Loan&apos;. There is bound, therefore, to be a good deal of opposition to this solution. s xlc ,   -.The second, difficulty arises out of a doubt as to Dr. Dolfuss&apos;s constitutional power to authorise the, issue of&apos; the loan without passing a law through his Parliament. When approving the Loan Protocol, the Austrian Parliament stipulated that a law should subsequently be passed authorising the terms, of
the loan. &quot;Owing to the establishment of a dictatorship by I)r:: Dbllfuss, the Austrian Parliament is now in abeyance and no law can be passed; : The Austrian Opposition parties (Socialists as well as National Socialists) have stated that, if 1 the loan is issued without the passage of the promised law, they will repudiate it if ever they come into office. Two French and British Constitutional lawyers, have advised that the law would be binding in international law, and that Dr. Dollfuss is constitutional entitled to authorise its issue without the passage of a law; but they both admit that, so far as the constitutional position is concerned; the&apos; contrary is arguable, and that a certain risk1 would&quot;attach to a1 loan issued in such circumstances. The French lawyer, therefore, suggested that the issue of the loan should be made conditional on the passage of the law through the Austrian Parliament.The position has been complicated hy the fact that, at the instigation df the Austrian Socialists, the French Socialist party have persuaded the French Government to tell Dr. Dollfuss that the loan will not be forthcoming unless he reverts to parliamentary methods. This Dr. Dollfuss could not do. It is, however, understood confidentially that a private arrangement has now been made between Dr. Dollfuss and the Austrian Socialists, by which the latter withdraw their opposition to the loan (which was in any case largely factious). The French Socialists, too, have shown signs of relaxing their opposition to the loan, for, since the tension between Austria and Germany became acute, they have begun to realise that to prevent it would play into the hands of the National Socialists.The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government was stated by Mr. Hore-Belisha in the House of Commons on the 17th May, when he said that, subject to technical difficulties being overcome, it was intended to proceed with the issue of the sterling portion of the loan simultaneously with the issue of the French portion of the loan in Paris.The French Cabinet decided on the 7th June to agree to the issue of the French share of the loan; Lord Tyrrell understands confidentially, however, that the French Ministry of Finance wish to reserve the French market for certain credit operations of its own until the beginning of July, but that it is hoped to issue the Austrian loan afterwards. It appears possible that the French market may not be able to absorb another loan for some little time. This might mean a postponement until the autumn.Meanwhile, public attention has been diverted by a striking change in Austria&apos;s foreign relations.III. Austro-German Relations.The present tension between Austria and Germany first became acute in the second week in May. The internal situation was already somewhat strained, and for the 14th May a large Heimwehr demonstration in Vienna had been announced. On the 8th May the Austrian National Socialists. announced that &quot;numerous official personages from the German Reich &quot; would visit Vienna on the 13th May. The chief of these was stated to be Dr. Franck, Bavarian Minister of Justice and Reich Commissioner of Justice, who had recently distinguished himself by making a broadcast speech at Munich, in which he had attacked the Austrian Govern-ment. In fact, it was quite clear to the Austrian Government that Dr. Franck&apos;s visit, which was unheralded by any official communication, was purely for party purposes to encourage the National Socialists in Austria, and on arriving by air at Vienna Dr. Franck was informed by the vice-president of the Viennese police that his visit &quot;was not especially desired.&quot; Every precaution was taken to; prevent Dr. Franck from making inflammatory speeches against the Austrian Government while he was in Vienna, but he subsequently drove to Graz, where it appears that he used personal and insulting language about the Austrian Chancellor before a large gathering of Nazis. He wad therefore informed by the Austrian Government that it was desirable that he should leave Austria as.?oon as possible. , .... -,-The net result of the incident was that Dr. Doll fuss and Heir Hitler were; each personally&apos; incensed atthe behaviour&apos; of the other and an acute&apos;cqntroyersy ensuedv-&apos; Herr Hitler went so Mi- as to tell the Austrian Minister in Berlin that &quot;&quot;any disagreeable acts or words directed against the Austrian National Socialists were directed against him and the German Government and the whole[8754] b 2
German people..&apos;&apos;v&apos;&apos; Baron von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister j appears to have-exerted his influence in the direction of moderation, but without success 1 ?:-v. &apos;/p.;. e lt      ,     ,Herr &quot;Hitler, not having received what he considered satisfaction, proceeded to punish Austria by depriving her of the valuable German: tourist traffic, .and amoiig a number of Other measures a&apos;visa fee of 1,000 marks has been instituted for German nationals visiting Austria-nominally owing to the risk that there might be-; incidents between German National Socialists visiting Austria and the Austrian authorities as a;result of the prohibition; of iNazi uniformsiin Austria.&apos; In retaliation, the Austrian Government have instituted a system of visas to prevent Austrians going to Germany except on business.Oh the 14th June an outbreak of bomb outrages occurred in Austria, attempts being made on the lives of Dr. Steidle, the Heimwehr leader, and also of Dr. liintelen, the former Minister of Education. The Chancellor thereupon ordered all National Socialist quarters to be seized and occupied and also had all German agitators in the country arrested with a view to their expulsion. Among the latter was a Herr Habicht, the German official who was in. charge of the Austrian National Socialist party. The Germans had feared that he might be proceeded against and had attempted to appoint him press attache at their Legation in Vienna, but the Austrians had apparently objected to his appointment. The Germans, nevertheless, claimed that he should have been granted diplomatic immunity until the question of his appointment was finally settled, and in retaliation they arrested Dr. Wasserback, the press attache at the Austrian Legation in Berlin. As Dr. Wasserback had held his appointment for ten years, this was a clear infringement of diplomatic immunity.  .The question of possible representations by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the German Government has been discussed in London with Dr. Dollfuss, the Austrian Chancellor, and with Signor Suvich, the Italian Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It was explained to Dr. Dollfuss that diplomatic representations to the German Government would, in our view, be likely merely to stiffen their attitude and make it harder for them to save their faces. On the other hand, the German Government had shown themselves to be sensitive to world opinion, and would be more likely to yield if the. press made it sufficiently clear that in the eyes of the public Germany stood condemned for her bullying.   This attitude has, indeed, been widely taken by the British press.Signor Suvich agreed with this view, and added that he thought it.would help to strengthen the impression thus created if some sympathetic notice of the Austrian situation were taken by private members in the House of Commons. Signor Suvich felt sure that this would have considerable weight in Germany.IV. Conclusion.In the preceding sections several of the main aspects of the Austrian problem have been analysed separately.  It remains to put the jig-saw together.If Dr. Dollfuss does not secure the promised loan, the survival of his Govern-ment for any length of time is, to say the least, problematical. It is highly probable that in the turmoil that would follow his downfall, the National Socialists might, by means of elections or otherwise, obtain power in Austria. This would amount in all but name to the &quot; Anschluss &quot; between Austria and Germany, for the Austrian National Socialists come under the ultimate control of Herr Hitler.Such a consummation would be most unwelcome to France. The Little Entente and Italy all object to the &quot; Anschluss &quot; (it is perhaps the only dislike that Italy has in cohrrnon with the others), and for this reason they all dread the establishment of a Hitlerite regime in Vienna. It is true that Germany has undertaken to &quot; respect strictly the independence of Austria &quot; by article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles, and that Austria, for her part, has undertaken by article 88 of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and by Protocol No. I signed at Geneva on the 4th October, 1922 (which is reaffirmed by the new Loan Protocol of the 15th July, 1932), not to alienate her economic or political independence except with the consent of the Council of the League of Nations. But a difficult situation would arise if, as has happened in Germany and Danzig, the Nazis succeeded in obtaining power by means of an apparently normal general election.
A Nazi Government in Austria would probably avoid any overt act which could be denounced as a breach of the: treaty; stipulations, safeguarding,. Austria&apos;sf independence.   The Germans would deny that . they had - done ;anythihg: .-tpf undermine Austria&apos;s independence; and the Austrians, for their part, would; probably say (as the Danzig. Nazis say); that: Hitler&apos; s;, supremacy was - purely philosophical and ideological, and.that politically and economically, they. were. still independent.   But the: fact would remain that the co-existence of two Nazi; Governments in Berlin and Vienna would at once be interpreted, and would almost certainly come sooner or later, to mean the accomplishment of the &quot; Anschluss &quot;* in*act.df not in law.   And without attempting to foretell the, reactions of the various other Governments concerned, it is safe to say that such a state of affairs would be bound from the outset to increase the feeling of insecurity and instability throughout Europe, and might easily lead to a highly critical situation if not very carefully handled.J.
