(2) Whether evidence should be taken from Soviet souroesin any enquiry undertaken on this matter, and if so, whether the Soviet representatives may be so informed if they raise the point during the ne got i at i on.I suggest that the answer to these questions should be in the affirmative.W.R.Board of Trade,10th July, 1933.
RUSSIAN TIMBER AND THE ANGLO-CANADIAN OTTAWA AGREEMENT.In view of the projected resumption of commercial negotiations with the.Soviet Government, and the protest made by the prime Minister of Canada about the contemplated issue of licences in respect of 46,000 standards of Russian timber, it is necessary to reach an early decision as to what action, if any, should now be taken in regard to Russian timber.     A short summary of the facts beginning from the Anglo-Canadian Ottawa Agreement is appended.During the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in the spring, the Soviet Delegation expressed themselves satisfied with the then existing temporary Commercial Agreement, and asked us in what respects we would propose to amend it.     They were reminded of Article 21 of the Anglo-Canadian Agreement, and informed that we should find it necessary to reserve the right to implement this Article and also to give a corresponding degree of protection to all Empire producers in respect of all preferences, and also to home producers.     A formula was sent to them setting out the qualifications to which any most-favoured^nation provisions in the new Agreement would have to be subject, and we were awaiting their comments when the negotiations was interrupted.So far as the home producers and Empire producers other than Canadian are concerned, legislation will no doubt eventually be necessary in order that appropriate powers may exist to give effect to these qualifications;   but so far as Canadian producers are concerned, the necessary powers already exist in Section 5 of the Ottawa Agreements Act.     The question for decision is therefore whether, now that the proclamation under the Russian Goods (Import Prohibition) Act has come to an end, any action should be taken in regard to Russian timber.Under Section 5 of the Ottawa Agreements Act it is not necessary for the Canadian Government, or for any producers organisations, to take any formal initiative before action c$n be
taken, but. a letter (marked &quot;personal&quot;) has now been received from Mr. Bennett, calling attention to our obligations.Before a decision can be taken as to the position of Russian timber in relation to the Anglo-Canadian Agreement, a full enquiry seems desirable in order to establish whether the conditions are such as to require aotion under Section 5 of the Ottawa Agreements Act, namely whether the preference on Canadian timber is &quot;likely to be frustrated in whole or in part by reason of the oreation or maintenance directly, or indirectly, of prices,... through State action&quot;.   The question accordingly arises as to how and by whom that inquiry should be conducted.   The various possibilities are either departmental investigation, or an enquiry either by an ad hoo body, or by the Enport Duties Advisory Committee.    Of these, the last seems clearly preferable.   The Import Duties Advisory Committee have experience in the collection and examination of facts relating to prices and costs, and, in particular, have recently had to examine a number of questions relating to timber. Moreover, any order issued under Section 5 pf the Ottawa Agreements Act would require the concurrence of the Treasury?    that Department under Section 11 of the Aot may refer to the Committee for oonaid-eration any question connected with the discharge of the functions of the Treasury under the Aot.A further question that arises is whether the Import Duties Advisory Committee, if asked to make the inquiry suggested, should take evidenoe from Soviet sources.   TWhen negotiations are resumed with the Soviet representatives it will no doubt be necessary to inform them of the inquiry contemplated, and they will oertainly ask whether they will be in a position to give evidence.It is suggested that inquiry should be limited, at any rate in the first instance, to sawn timber &quot;and sleepers;   these are the only classes of timber in respeot of wfyich the question of Article 21 has been seriously raised.Board of Trade,7th July, 1933. ,
APPENDIX.RUBbIAN TIMBER AND THE ANGLO-CANADIAN AGREEMENT. HISTORICAL NOTE.1. Article 21 of the Anglo-Canadian Ottawa Agreement is inthe following terms-. -This Agreement is made on the express condition that, if either Government is satisfied that any preferences hereby granted in respect of any particular class of commodities are likely to be frustrated in whole or in part by reason of the creation or maintenance directly or indirectly of prices for such class of commodities through State action on the part of any foreign country, that Government hereby declares that it will exercise the powers which it now has or will hereafter take to prohibit the entry from such foreign country directly or indirectly ef such commodities into its country for such time as may be necessary to make effective and to maintain the preferences hereby granted by it.Corresponding provision was made in the Ottawa Act, (Section 5), under which, if the Board cf Trade are at any time satisfied that the conditions set out above are fulfilled, they may, if the Treasury concur, make an order &quot;prohibiting the importation from the foreign country concerned into the United Kingdom of gocds of the class or description in respect of which preferences are frustrated.2. These previsions were tacitly recognised as having particular reference to Russian timber, but as long as the Temporary Commercial Agreement with the Soviet Union was in force no action would have been possible in view of the most-favoured-nation provisions of that Agreement.     Notice was given to terminate the Agreement, which accordingly expired on the 17th April, 1933.3. During the winter certain negotiations took place between representatives of the British Columbia timber producers and the timber trade in this country with a view to a bulk purchase of British Columbia timber.     No difficulty arose over the better quality timber, but all timber producers require to dispose at
X 6 Xthe 3ame time of the lower grade timber, known as &quot;earoassing&quot; timber.   The British Columbia interests would not be satisfied with the sale of leas than 75,000 standards of &quot;carcassing&quot; timber as against 12-15,000 standards of such timber actually imported from British Columbia in 1932.   They further proposed a substantial increase in price.   The timber trade interests could not see any prospeot of selling the timber that would have justified them in underwriting the sale of so large a quantity.4.   There were also discussions with Timber Distributors Limited, who were proposing to underwrite the sale of the total supply of Russian sawn timber for the season now ourrent, as they had done in the previous season.   The arrangement is that Timber Distributors guarantee the sale of a certain quantity at certain prices.   In return for this the Russians undertake riot to sell a quantity in excess of the totaj; ujrjdQy^rj^tejj, The amount originally proposed to be underwritten waa $ minimum of 450,000 standards and a maximum of 495,000 standards as compared with a maximum of 450,000 standards, all of whioh was absorbed, in the 1932 season.   They pointed out that the stooks in this country were considerably smaller than at the corresponding period in the previous year, and that the market was firmer, and claimed that the quantity proposed was economically and commercially justifiable.    It was however pointed out to them that in view of the Anglo-Canadian Agreement any inoreaae in the supply of Russian timber was dearly open to or It io ism, and that it was desirable to leave a gap which oould be filled from Canada.   They thereupon negotiated further with the Russians, with the result that the quantity was reduced to a minimum of 395,000 standards and a maximum of 435,000 standards.   They then asked for an assuranoe that the importation of this quantity would be possible, but they
were informed that no assurance of any kind could he given.5. As soon as the quantity of Russian sawn timber underwritten for the 1933 season was known, a communication was received from the High Commissioner for Canada, acting on instructions from his Government, stating that if the United Kingdom market were to be filled up as proposed his Government would find it necessary to ask that action should be taken to implement Article 21 of the Ottawa Agreement.At that time no action would have been possible as the Temporary Commercial Agreement with the Soviet Union was still in operation, but a memorandum was sent to Mr. Ferguson setting out the facts, and pointing out that, after allowing for the decrease in the &quot;carry-over&quot; of Russian timber as compared with the previous season, there was now a gap of 76,500 standards which it was open to Canadian timber to fill.      There the matter has rested, so far as sawn timber is concerned, until Mr. Bennett&apos;s protest on the 28th June.6, During the negotiations with the Soviot Government in the spring, a formula was sent to the Soviet representatives setting out the qualifications to which any most-favoured-nation undertaking in a new Agreement would have to be subject.     This formula, in addition to allowing us to take action in regard to Article 21 of the Anglo-Canadian Agreement, would also have permitted the same action,  in the same conditions as those set-out in that Article, to safeguard all other Imperial preferences and to protect the home produoer.     A copy of the formula is attached.     No reaction to this formula was ever received,  as its transmission was closely followed by the Moscow arrests.7. As the expiry of the Temporary Commercial Agreement (17th April) was immediately followed by the Proclamation (19th April) the question of action under Section 5 of the Ottawa Agreements Act has not hitherto arisen.
8.    During the embargo, however, an application was received for licences to import a quantity of Russian sleeper blocks, against which an advance had been made before the Proclamation. The contract provided for the proceeds of the sale of the -sleeper blocks to be applied to repayment of the advance until that repayment was completed.     The applicants were informed that licences would be granted for the importation of a sufficient quantity to enable the advance to be recovered, but that further importation would not be possible.9. Shortly afterwards a letter was received from the High Commissioner for Canada, apparently acting on his own initiative, protesting against the sale of Russian sleeper blocks at prices which he described as unduly low.     In reply, it was pointed out that there was no Intention of permitting during the embargo the importation of any sleeper blocks for which payment had not been made.     He was however reminded of the purpose for which the embargo was imposed, in order that it might be clear that the question of Article 21 was in no way prejudged, one way or another.     As regards prices, it was pointed out that the price position might undergo considerable modification to the advantage of Canadian producers, before the embargo came to an end.10. But for the prospect that the status quo before the embargo would soon be restored, it would have been possible to deal with Mr. Bennett&apos;s protest on similar lines.Board of Trade.
