? ^ %ht u OSECRET.CP. 200(33). .copy no. 4*4*CABINET.THE PARIS AIR AGREEMENT AND THE SALE OP BRITISH AIRCRAFT AND ENGINES TO GERMANY,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.I regret to have to trouble my colleagues further at such short notice with the question of the export of British aircraft and engines to Germany.     I have, however, this morning held a meeting on this subject with the Permanent and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State to the Foreign Office on the one hand, and the Air Member for Supply and Research and the Permanent Secretary of the Air Ministry on the other.     As a result we are all agreed that there are major political issues of policy involved which necessitate a Cabinet decision.     Meantime, important negotiations, which might result in valuable orders for the aircraft manufacturing industry, are held up, with the result that the business may well pass into foreign hands.     The annexed memorandum, out-lining the facts and recommending a specific course of action, has accordingly been prepared in the Air Ministry after discussion with the Foreign Office.Air Ministry, July 27, 1933.The Supply of Aircraft and Engines to Germany.Memorandum by the Air Ministry.1.       The Paris Air Agreement of 1926, of which Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany are signatories contains, inter alia clauses prohibiting s-(a) (b)c) d)The possession by Germany of armed aircraft.The importation of aircraft having the technical characteristics of modern fighting aeroplanes except under licences issued by the German Government exclusively for the purpose of international competitions or records.The possession of aircraft by the Police, and establishment of any special Air Police Organisation2.       A number of enquiries from German sources, official and unofficial, have been received by British aircraft and engine manufacturers in the course of the past few months.3.       One such specific enquiry, on which a decision is urgently required, has been addressed to Messrs. Armstrong Siddeley and concerns the sale to the Allgemeine Elektrizitats Gesellbchaft, Berlin, of manufacturing rights in their engines, including supercharged types.
8.       Moreover there is evidence that representatives of various foreign countries are busily negotiating in Germany at the present time for the sale of their products,  and no difficulties appear to be being put in their path by their respective Governments,The following list is not exhaustive  :-France . Gnome RhoneLorraine Potez HanriotItaly. Isetta FraschiniGaproni Breda FiatAmerica. Pratt &amp; Witney C u r t i s s -Wr i gh t Boeing9.       Nevertheless, although it is not a question of a technical breach of the Paris Air Agreement, the Foreign Office suggest that, if it became public (as in all probability it would) that any large exports of aircraft or engines capable of military use had been made to Germany in present ciroumstances, or that British manufacturers were in negotiation(^Note: under the control described in paragraph 6.)4,       In the past supercharged engines have been regarded as primarily for military use, and permission35- to sell them to countries such a&apos;.s Germany has been withheld. Supercharged engines are, however, coming more and more into use for legitimate civil purposes and are now employed not only by the Lufthansa (the German commercial air transport combine ), but also by our own Imperial Airways and in the United States and elsewhere.5.       There is, therefore, no technical ground on which it can be urged that the sale of these engines (or rights to manufacture them) to Germany is in conflict with the terms of the Paris Air Agreement in 1926, even if we have little doubt that in fact the enquiry in regard to these engines is part and parcel of the deliberate attempt the        ij German Government are making to build up the nucleus of a military air force, however disguised.6.       There is no obvious statutory ground on which the sale of aircraft engines or unarmed aircraft to Germany can be prohibited (only armed aircraft require an Export Licence), but the Air Ministry is in a position to bring effective pressure on manufacturers by informal means, if it is thought such a prohibition is desirable on grounds of policy.7.       The effect of such a prohibition at the present time would, however, be that Germany would turn elsewhere and get her requirements fulfilled without difficulty to the detriment of British industry.It is significant in this connection that the Direct or-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs at Vienna informed Sir Walford Selby less than a week ago that: -&quot;Austria and other countries would have no cause to purchase aircraft in England as they could easily fill their requirements from the South Austrian border&quot;.
with the German authorities for the sale of aircraft or engine manufacturing rights, considerable political embarrassment might result, both in this country and abroad.      For instance If this trade were once allowed to develop it is possible that Great Britain might obtain the monopoly of it.     For political reasons the German Government might very well prefer to buy from this country.     In that event the position might easily arise where French and Italian Governments would be able to make great play of the fact that while the French and Italian aircraft industries were doing no illicit trade with Germany, British industry were engaged in the aeronautical re-armament of that country.10*     The Foreign Office have already suggested that British aircraft and engine manufacturers should be circu-larlsed forthwith and requested not to conclude any agreement for the sale of aircraft or engines whether to the German Government direct or to any German Ministry or Public Authority and particularly the Police, unless they have received a categorical written assurance from the German Government that the material in question will not be used for any purpose forbidden by the Paris Air Agreement of 1926. This arrangement should be extended to the sale of manufac-turing rights *11s     The Air Ministry are quite prepared to take this action (though, as above stated, it rests on no Statutory Powers, and may be resented in some quarters as an unfair restraint on legitimate trade), but feel it essential that we shall ensure that the other countries concerned, more particularly France, Italy and Belgium, take identical action with their own manufacturers.     They feel this to be the more important in view of the information as to the activities of other foreign interests in Germany contained in paragraph 8 above and the statement made in Vienna to Sir W. Selby Cvide paragraph 7 above).     Should these countries not consent to take identical measures, then they consider British Manufac-turers ought not to continue to labour under a unilateral restriction.12.     Moreover, the Air Ministry suggest that such action on our part will have definite political advantages in that(a) By taking the initiative in this matter, we shall be making it clear to the public in this country and abroad that we are determined to take all possible steps to prevent the illegal rearmament of Germany and, in particular, to secure the observance of the Paris Air Agreement;(b) As our action will be contingent on identical reciprocal action on the part of the other countries principally concerned, it cannot be argued that British industry is being subjeoted to discriminatory restraint.13.      There is, however, one difficulty.     The U.S.A. is not a party to the Paris Air Agreement, and agents of a number of American undertakings are reported to be active in Germany.     As President Roosevelt has repeatedly intimated his strong opposition to any measures of German rearmament it is for consideration whether the U.S.A. should not also be approached.    Otherwise American manufacturers will be placed in an exceptionally favourable position, of which they will not be slow to take advantage.Czecho-Slovakia is also not a party to the Agreement and has a growing aircraft manufacturing industry.
It is suggested that, subject to any views the Cabinet may express, the countries to be included in the proposed arrangement should be left for interdepartmental discussion between the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry.14.       The Air Ministry accordingly make the following concrete recommendations to the Cabinet :-(a) That the aircraft and engine manufacturers in this country shall be circularised as in paragraph 10 above;(b) That Messrs. Armstrong Siddeley be allowed to negotiate with the German authorities for the sale of manufacturing rights in their engines (including supercharged engines), subject to their securing the written assurance in question before concluding an agreement;(c) That our diplomatic representatives in the capitals concerned shall forthwith request that the competent authorities in the several countries shall take identical action vis-a-vis their own manufacturers, making it clear that our own attitude is definitely contingent on their so,jiojjhgj.(d) That, unless there is general agreement on the part of these countries, our own industry shall be released from this requirement;(e) That it should be left to the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry to determine in consultation what countries other than signatories to the Paris Agreement, should be approached with a view to their becoming parties to the proposed arrangement, e.g. the U.S.A. and Czecho-Slovakia.15.     The Foreign Office before concurring in these proposals have expressed the wish that the views of the Cabinet should first be obtained on the political aspect of the whole question.Air Ministry, July 27,  1933.
