h Q * secret.COPY BOOV. oG A B I H E T QTemporary ftrant for Piatreaaed Area a, Mempmndum, by them Minister of Health,My colleagues will be aware that during the last twelve months I have been strongly pressed by a group of local authorities and of members representing the most hardly hit industrial areas, to afford those areas a special measure of financial, helpc.     The earlier history of the matter is dealt with in Cabinet Memorandum CoP0lQ8(33)*The Government -s proposals for help to these areas were otitllned by me in the House on the 12th April, in terms agreed by the Cabinet, in connection with the announcement of a Bill to be introduced under which the central.government will assume administrative and financial responsibility for assisting the able-bodied who need assistance 1 subject to the necessary adjustment of the block grant provided under the local Government Act, 19891.     The proposals were that the more fortunate areas should be asked, pending the introduction of the permanent policy, to make some contribution out of their share of the block grant for the current financial year towards helping the hard pressed areas,., supplemented, by. an additional contribution from the Exchequer equal to one-half of the sum contributed by the local authorities,1 proceeded to negotiate this proposal with the representatives of the Associations of local Authorities and the  ,,0*0*., making to them the suggestion that the more prosperous areas,, that is to say those whose expenditure on out-relief is below a rate of ablaut 8/-, should contribute out of
their block grant for the present year the equivalent of a rate of -gdos, the Exchequer to add a sum equivalent to 50 per oent0 of the amount contributed0The sum contributed by the local Authorities under this plan would have amounted, to approximately  454s, 0009 making with the Exchequer contribution a total of about  651,000 for England, and WalesB    A provisional scheme for distribution was put before the representatives^These proposals9 in so far as they involved contributions from the local authorities,, have not been aceeptedo The general attitude has been that while anxious to assist the Government as far as possible,, local authorities accepted the scheme of the Act of 19S9 which provided for perie&amp;le&amp;l revisions of the block grant as a stable scheme0     They were strongly opposed on principle to any suggestion which would have the effect that money found by one group   of authorities should be spent by anothereThe opposition to the scheme is so strong and general that in my view it is no good to press It any further on the Associations and the Ii*C0C0 with a view to an agreed schsme0 Failing   such an agreed schemeB I do not think that it would be expedient to introduce legislation making the contribution compulsory*     It is in the highest degree desirable on general grounds that at the present time in particular the existing cordial co-operation between the central government and the local authorities should be preserved^,      Negotiations regarding the finance of the permanent scheme will soon have to be set on foot and it would be impolitic to undertake them in an atmosphere of antagonism produced by forcing the temporary scheme on local authorities in the teeth of their strong opposition0At the same time I am clear that the position of the depressed areas - more especially the industrial Horth - East
and the mining areas of S8 Wales - requires immediate relief. The private resources open to the tmemployed are becomingexhausted,, the expenditure of the local authorities of those areas on out-reliefB high for some years, has been steadily Increasing and wills it appears,, be considerably higher this year than last.     The ability of the ratepayers to meet the increased charges has become lessp and any balances which the authorities were able to draw on In previous years have disappeared or been reduced to negligible figures.If something must be found and we cannot get it from the local authorities^ the only course remaining Is to increase the amount which it was already proposed to find from tne Exchequer to the bare minimum necessary by way of temporary helpc It is accordingly proposed that,the exchequer should provide the sum of  500,000 for Great Britain for this purpose and that the distribution should be made&apos; in accordance with schemes approved by the Treasury,     It Is proposed, that the distribution to the distressed areas should be generally on the lines of the scbeme which was   put before the local authorities&apos;&apos; representatives and was in their view satisfactory.The money would be provided by a supplementary vote and I should propose to take into consideration what conditions should be attached to the grants to secure that where bad public assistance administration exists it is remedied as far as possibleI have the concurrence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in making this proposal, and I ask for the authority of the Cabinet-: for the introduction of the necessary supplementary estimate 0The temporary scheme for England and Wales was also proposed to the Scottish local authorities and met with similar opposition.     The amount above stated is to cover all three countries and it is proposed that it should ba apportioned in the usual manner as between England and Wales and Scotland.(Intld,)   E.
