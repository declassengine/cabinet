g DOCUMENT 18 THE property  OF I.II3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT).0 A B I N E T-EC RET.COPY NO e&quot;^^ o o o oELECTRIFICATION OF SUBURBAN LINES,Memorandum by the Minister of Transport and the Treasury, Introductory,1.     At tneir meeting on the 22j.th May, 1935, tne Cabinet authorised the Minister of Transport and the Treasury to present a statement of what powers are required and what proposals are agreed in order to push on with the electrification of suburban railways. Historical.2.     As a result of their inquiries into travelling facilities in various parts of London the London and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee, some years ago, recommended that the companies concerned should give immediate consideration to a number of specified proposals some of which Involved electrification.As part of the policy of expediting and subsidising public works of economic value in order to provide emp?.oyraent, a number of these schemes either of construction of electric railways or of electrification were assisted under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929*The extension of the Piccadilly Tube Railway to a point beyond Southgste has been carried out with substantial financial assistance from the Government under the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, 1929.     An interchange station at Manor House to enable passengers conveniently to secure connection with the tube railways, trams and omnibuses serving Tottenham, Edmonton and Enfield has also been constructed.
The electrification of the London Midland and Scottish line &quot;between Barking and Upminster has been carried out with substantial assistance under the Development Act 8nd has afforded much needed facilities to the large population concentrated on the housing estates at Becontree and Dagenhara,Other works in connection with London Passenger transport recommended by the Advisory Committee which have not been carried out ere set out in Appendix A. Further schemes,5*     Electrification schemes within the area of the London Passenger Transport Board have to be considered by a Standing Joint Committee provided for by the London Passenger Transport Act, to consist of four members appointed by the London Passenger Transport Board and four members appointed by the Amalgamated Railway Companies (one member each).     The Board has just been appointed and steps are being taken to ensure that the Standing Joint Committee is established and gets to work.The schemes of both the London and North Eastern and the London, Midland and Scottish Companies for the electrification of certain of their London Suburban lines are in an advanced state of preparation and the Companies recently stated that they would be in a position to submit detailed schemes to the Joint Committee as soon as it is set up.     In fact, consultations have already been proceeding for some months, at the instance of the Ministry of Transport between the Main Lines and the Underground management with a view to clearing up in advance, so far as possible, any technical or other questions upon which agreement between the Main Lines and the Board will be necessary. The principal schemes in the London area are:-L, &amp; N.E.Electricicetlon of (a) the Great Eastern (Liverpool Street) Suburban Lines and (b) the Great Northern (King&apos;s
L . lil e    &amp;   S .New line between Euston and llsrpenden (Herts). Slow lines to V/atford.In addition, proposals for the electrification of the lines to Tring, Hemel Hempsteadj Stanmore and from Upminster to Southend ere receiving consideration,S.R.The Southern Railway has already electrified a large part of its services in the suburban area 8nd has made an important extension to Brighton. The Company received no grant under the Development Act but was permitted to apply towards this extension the relief obtained by the repeal of railway passenger duty.      It is probable that the Company will make a further extension of their electrified services to Eastbourne in the near future.It may be added that in evidence before the Railway Rates Tribunal recently Sir Herbert ?/alker9 in answer to the President&apos;s question whether he had any doubt that their capital expenditure on electrification was wise, replied as follows:-&quot;I have not the slightest doubt- If it had not been for our policy of electrification our net revenue would have been considerably less than it is today, even after making allowance   for interest on the capital that has been spent.&quot;if.     Although schemes of suburban electrification need not be confined to London they are not of general application. There is probably opportunity for development in the Wirral Peninsula, round Manchester and perhaps one or two other large cities.     As regards the Wirral Peninsula, a scheme was actually submitted to the Committee under the Development Act, but was suspended on failure to reach satisfactory agreement with other traffic authorities. Financial assistance.5.     Until the estimates of expenditure and revenue from the schemes under consideration have been made available to the Ministry of Transport, it is not possible to say how far or how rapidly any one of them might become self-supporting.6.     On the financial aspect of the London schemes it should be noted that the. passing of the London Passenger
Transport Act brings about   a fundamental change in the position as compared with the circumstances previously existing.     Under that Act, the ^hole of the passenger receipts of the Board and of the main line railways (so far as their suburban services are concerned) are to be pooled, and the Board are empowered to participate financially In any new schemes which may be approved by the Joint Committee.     The scheme for the electrification of the suburban lines from King&apos;s Gross, referred to in paragraph 5* v/as in  set put before the Committee under the Development Act but was later suspended, on the motion of the Committee, on the pooling agreement between the main line railway being reached, the Committee considering that the   -financial estimates of the scheme as originally submitted would require substantial alteration in view of the agreement.It was generally understood that on the London Passenger Act becoming law suburban electrification would be proceeded with as opportunity offered without financial assistance.7.      In the light of the change of circumstances and of the lapse of the powers contained in the Development Act, 1929* the question of financial assistance is not automatically governed by the action tsken on pest cases at a time when it was the Government&apos;s policy to subsidise public works of many kinds where employment was provided.     Until detailed estimates have been prepared it is premature to indicate on what basis Exchequer assistance might be proposed, but, even if it is found that works would not be put in hand next winter without any assistance, it will be for consideration whether assistance should be given having regard to the general question whether in the changed circumstances brought afcout by the London Passenger Act, London Transport should be subsidised at the expense of the general taxpayer.
8.     In view of the Government&apos;s known desire to see productive schemes started end their statement that no good scheme would fail to receive consideration the Board and the Railway Companies may appros en the question with the definite policy of securing assistance.     Serious issues are involved from the point of view of public finance and it is$ therefore, submitted that such assistance should not be considered until it is shown to be necessary in regard to a particular scheme.     It is suggested that the Minister of Transport ohould continue his discussions with the Hallway Companies, reporting further as may be necessary when the information on which a decision can be taken is obtained.9*     Under Section 17 of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, the Minister has certain limited powers, subject to the approval of the Treasury, to make advances out of moneys provided by Parliament for the construction,. improvement or maintenance of railways, but, if the Government eventually decide to give assistance in order to accelerate the starting of the works, it is suggested that the appropriate procedure would be legislation on an ad hoc basis.(Intd.)
