SECRET. CP.  151 (35).COPY NO.$1CABINET.THE EUROPEAN SITUATION. ATTITUDE OF FRANCE.Despatch dated May 9th, 1933, from Lord Tyrrell to Sir John Simon.(Circulated &quot;by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.)2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 6th June,  1933.
EUROPE GENERAL.May 12, 1933.CONFIDENTIAL.Section 1.[C 4287/2293/18]No. 1.Lord Ty7&apos;rell to Sir John Simon. (Received May 12.)(No. 674.) Sir,Paris, May 9, 1933.SIR HORACE RUMBOLD, in paragraph 7 of his despatch No. 361, Confidential, of the 7th April, mentioned the views of Dr. Klein, chief editor of the Deutsche Allgemeine ZeiUcng, in regard to the international position with special reference to the attitude of France.2. It is true, as Dr. Klein states, that responsible people in France were recently talking of a preventive war against Germany. War talk, however, is a. not infrequent phenomenon in France, where it springs readily to the lip in moments of international tension. It occurred, for instance, after the German elections of September 1930, and at the time of the German-Austrian declaration regarding the intention to form a customs union. It is due, of course, to the French temperament, which at times of excitement is apt to loose all sense of proportion and induces a state of mind in which the contingency of a German aggression looms as an inevitable and imminent menace. On this occasion it went a stage further : Hitler&apos;s accession to power, and the measures which he subse-quently took to stifle all opposition to his will were regarded as so grave that there was actually some talk in responsible circles to the effect that nothing but a preventive war could thwart Germany&apos;s design to take her revenge as soon as she was in a position to do so. It took, however, the form of a declaration of belief rather than of purpose; and I attached little importance to it, knowing that it would soon die down, as in fact it has. Both the Government and public are now taking the situation calmly, though their misgivings have in no sense diminished. These misgivings are reflected in the increasing caution of French policy as regards the Four-Power Pact and the British disarmament plan, but there is no question in the country at large of preventive war and no French Government would be able to engage in one. In my opinion, nothing short of actual aggression on French soil would at the present time provoke this country to war.3. The existing state of relations between France and Poland is somewhat obscure, and I should hesitate to endorse Dr. Klein&apos;s opinion that &quot; Poland was being held back by France &quot; at the present time. France is becoming increasingly concerned at the entangling nature of her commitments in respect of the Polish western frontier, but the position as seen here is slightly different. There is little love lost between the present Left Radical Government and the regime of Marshal Pilsudski. There is little probability, I should have thought, of the French Government in present circumstances seeking to exercise, or being able to exercise, any effective influence over Poland. On the other hand, there is a strong feeling that Marshal Pilsudski is quite capable of looking after himself, and nobody would be surprised if one day it was discovered that he had made his own terms, with Hitler. I should doubt whether the friendly exchanges of views between Herr Hitler and the Polish Minister in Berlin, and between Marshal Pilsudski and the German Minister in Warsaw, recently reported in the press, was in any way instigated by the French Government. It was notable that, in the agitation which followed on the Rome conversations, it was M. Titulesco and M. Benes who took the lead in marshalling opposition to the idea of treaty revision, while the voice of Poland was unusually silent. It is partly the feeling that Poland can no longer be relied on to resist German expansion that is at the back of M. Herriofs campaign in favour of closer relations with Soviet Russia.. What Poland would do in the event of hostilities between Germany and France is. another matter, and one on which I am not qualified to express an opinion.4. As regards Dr. Klein&apos;s information that the French armament factories, are working night and day. Colonel Heywood, military attache to His Majesty&apos;&amp;[815 m-1]
Embassy:, states that the factories are, indeed, fully employed, but that it is mainly on arms and munitions destined for the Far East arid South America. He has no knowledge of extra work being undertaken on French account, and it appears very unlikely as, owing to the drastic cuts in the military credits, no funds are available.I have, &amp;c.TYRRELL.P.S. A copy of this despatch is being sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Berlin and Warsaw.T.
