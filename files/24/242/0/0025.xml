Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1933.SECEET.CP. 175 (33).Mr. EDEN, who returned from Geneva on the 29th June, has at my request written the annexed paper about future procedure on disarmament. I circulate it to my colleagues with the request that, if any of them wish the matter to be brought up before the Cabinet, notice should be given. Otherwise, I think the general line indicated by Mr. Eden might be pursued. I keep fully in mind the Cabinet decision that we should avoid being drawn. into details in private discussion, with the result that we run the. risk of having the onus of a breakdown put on our shoulders. The essential thing is to find out whether Franco-German agreement is. possible, but for this purpose it seems to me Mr. Henderson is probably right in seeking to have interviews in Paris,. Rome and Berlin in turn. We can hardly refuse to have anything to do with these conversations when Mr. Henderson presses that we should be there. But we can make sure that the Cabinet direction is observed. For example, in Paris 1 apprehend that our line would be that we. want to know what disarmament the French are able to offer. If they say that this depends on the degree of. security, we can ask them to develop that thesis without committing ourselves (which we certainly ought not to do) to any hypothetical promise. This is Mr. Eden&apos;s conception, and I entirely agree with it.- - j.       S.Foreign Office, July 4, 1933.,Mr. Henderson proposed to the Bureau of the Disarmament Conference on the 27th June that the General Commission should stand adjourned until the 16th October. This was in accordance with the agreement reached in conversations at the Foreign Office on Tuesday, the 20th June. This adjournment has now been approved by the General Commission itself on the understanding that Mr. Henderson should now begin a disarmament tour and seek by private conversations to reach agreement where public discussion has failed. Mr. Henderson tells me that it is his intention to begin this tour in Paris, where he will seek to discover from the French Government what is their attitude towards the disarmament sections of the United Kingdom Draft Convention. This attitude has never yet been declared. Mr. Henderson has indicated to me several times in conversation his desire that the United Kingdom Government should be represented at these conversations. He argues that it is our Draft Convention. We have, therefore, a right to be represented whenever any amendments to it are discussed. In view of the decision of the Cabinet Committee of the 19th June that we should make it &quot; clear to Mr. Henderson that we are prepared to assist in these conversations to the best of our ability and to adopt the role of honest broker if this should be of any assistance,&quot; I feel that it is difficult to refuse this request. Moreover, it would be helpful to us to be kept informed in this way of the progress of these conversations. Were we to refuse this measure of co-operation, Mr. Henderson would no doubt feel slighted.So far as I know the time-table at present, I understand that Mr. Henderson will begin his conversations in Paris early next week, and we may therefore expect an early request for our help.

time Mr. Henderson will no doubt ask him.&quot; to take part in these conversations also. Mr. Henderson further proposes, if he can discover sufficient of the intentions of the French Government to justify him in the hopes of ultimate agreement, to proceed from Paris to Rome, to seek Italian accord for any measure of agreement reached, and thence to Berlin.Our position in all this is not easy. There is this further complication : I have received more than one hint from M. Paul-Boncour and M, Massigli, and even from M. Daladier himself, that, while French Ministers are willing--and indeed anxious to discuss their attitude to our Draft Convention with us, they are by no means eager to do so with Mr. Henderson. They have apparently no confidence in the judgment or discretion of his entourage.If we do take part in these conversations it is important that we should seek to concentrate attention upon the fundamental differences of the respective policies of France and Germany, which, in the words of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s conclusions, &apos;&apos; are the crux of the whole problem which, confronts the Disarma-ment Conference &quot;; but to do this it is essential to know what, if any, disarma-ment France is prepared to agree to in the light of present events in Germany. It seems to me that this is the best way to begin to find cut whether France and Germany can be got to agree. I would therefore suggest that the role of any united Kingdom participant in conversations should be to.ask what disarmament the French Government are prepared to undertake and on what conditions. It may be that France is sO much under the influence of recent events in Germany that she will not agree to any disarmament. I do not myself anticipate quite so rigid an attitude, but in any event.it is surely desirable that we should be as clear as possible upon the French attitude, and there are certain parts of the Convention as to which the frank exchange of views can do nothing- but good.The Naval Chapter is such an example. It is here that the French case is weakest and it is clearly important to us to secure&apos; French and&apos; Italian adherence to the Naval Chapter all the more important in the light of the present attitude of Japan. Pressure oh the French Government to declare such acceptance would be fully justified and, in the light of their anxieties to secure our support on other issues, might now prove successful.I would therefore suggest that if and when Mr. Henderson appeals for the assistance of a British representative at his conversations we should agree. If you concur, I would further suggest that Mr. Cadogan should attend in the first instance, with authority to ask for me to join him if and when he considers it necessary.\    :        (Initialled) A.
