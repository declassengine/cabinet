Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1933.SECRET. Copy No.   39CP. 156 (33).CABINET.[E 2893/305/91]PROPOSED TRANSFER TO FOREIGN OFFICE OR INDIA OFFICE OF COLONIAL OFFICE WORK IN CONNEXION WITH THE PERSIAN GULF.IN a memorandum of the 9th June (CP. 154 (33)) the Secretary of State for the Colonies recommended that the Colonial Office should be relieved of the work which it has hitherto performed in connexion with the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. In the final paragraph of that memorandum Sir P. Cunliffe-Lister left it to the Cabinet to decide whether that work should be transferred to the Foreign Office or to the India Office. I now circulate to my colleagues herewith, for their consideration, a memorandum, giving the reasons why I consider that it is desirable that this work should be transferred to the Foreign Office. In view of the divergence of opinion on the subject between the Secretary of State for India (who is also circulating a memorandum) and myselfr I suggest that the Cabinet should appoint either a small committee, or one of its members, to study this question, and to make recommendations for a solution.J. S.Foreign Office, June 10, 1933.Memorandum.The present position is that the internal and administrative affairs of the Sheikhdoms on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf in so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned (except as regards questions connected with oil concessions) are dealt with by the India Office, while political questions affecting the relations of these States with other areas (and questions connected with the grant of oil concessions) are dealt with by the Colonial Office. The reasons for which the Colonial Office was entrusted with this work are set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Sir P. Cunliff e-Lister&apos;s memorandum (CP. 154 (33)), and were mainly that the neighbouring areas, i.e., Iraq and Arabia, fell, at the time when the arrangement was made, within the province of the Colonial Office. With the conquest of the Hejaz by King Ibn Saud in 1925, and the subsequent unification of Saudi Arabia as a single State under him, the Foreign Office has replaced the Colonial Office in so far as Arabian affairs are concerned, while the Foreign Office has inevitably similarly taken over the control of the Empire&apos;s foreign relations with Iraq since the 3rd October, 1932, when that country became completely independent on her admission to membership of the League of Nations. The fact that the Colonial Office still retains control over Palestine and Trans Jordan and over the Aden Protectorate an arrangement which has been quoted in this connexion as showing that the transfer of Arabian work from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office is not in fact complete is not strictly relevant to the present issue. Not only are both these territories far removed from the Persian Gulf, from which they are separated by vast deserts and with which they have practically no political relations, but they fall into an entirely6918   [8712]
-different category from the rest of Arabia. Palestine and T ran s j or dan form a mandated territory, for the whole internal administration of. which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom,are responsible, while the Aden.Protectorate is a part of the British Empire, and it is therefore suitable that it should be dealt with in the same way as other British Protectorates and Colonies.      V      ,i : : .2. The reasons which led to the political affairs of the Persian Gulf States being placed under the control of the Colonial Office therefore now apply with identical force to the proposal that these duties should be taken over by the Foreign Office, on which Department the remainder of such Colonial Office work has already devolved.3. Indeed, these reasons now appear to apply with even greater cogency than when the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee were originally made, since the foreign relations of certain of the Persian Gulf States have now become more important and complicated than at any previous time. For example, in the case of Bahrein, one of the most important political questions with which His Majesty&apos;s Government have to deal is that of the Persian claim to the islands. This claim, forms one of the main difficulties between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Persian Government, and must be one of the chief questions for settlement in any general treaty between the two countries. Similarly, among the most important political questions with which His Majesty&apos;s Government have to deal in connexion with Koweit are those concerning the relations between Koweit and Saudi Arabia which are at present strained, but which it is important to re-establish as soon as possible on a satisfactory basis -and those between Koweit and Iraq. Iraq, in particular, has more than once shown annexationist tendencies towards Koweit, which it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government firmly to discourage.4. Moreover, the question of the grant of oil concessions in Koweit and Bahrein has now become an important Anglo-American issue. Again, the inter-national importance of the principalities of the Trucial Coast has recently been greatly increased by the development of international air communications, and both the French and the Netherlands Governments have applied for permission for their aircraft to fly regularly over this area. Indeed, with the development of air communication between Europe and the Persian Gulf, with the impending completion of the pipe-lines from Iraq to the Mediterranean, and with the possible construction of the Haifa-Bagdad railway, the Persian Gulf area is becoming more closely connected with Europe, through Iraq and the Near East, and there-fore less a mere dependency of India, as it was in the 19th century. In short, the development of its oil resources and its geographical situation on the main air route to the East are likely to make of it in the future a region of first-class international importance. The Foreign Office, which is now responsible for British policy in regard to all the immediately neighbouring independent countries, is in a particularly favourable position to keep British imperial interests as a whole in the forefront of the policy to be followed, to hold an even balance between the various local interests involved, and, while fully safeguarding the interests of the British-protected Arab States of the Persian Gulf, to ensure that their political affairs should be dealt with from a comprehensive point of view.5. Actually, the territories in question do not form part either of the British Empire or of India. They are independent States for the conduct of whose foreign relations His Majesty&apos;s Government are at present responsible. It would therefore seem logical that these foreign relations should be dealt with direct by the Department of State responsible for the foreign policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and for the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other foreign countries in the same area. Were these relations to be dealt with in the first instance through the India Office it is admitted that the foreign Office would have to be consulted in every case before any decision could be reached. The process would, therefore, merely be complicated by the introduction of a further mechanical stage. If, on the other hand, the Foreign Office takes over the duties in regard to these States which have hitherto been carried out by the Colonial Office, while the India Office would still be consulted, and while the close co-operation which has now been established between the various Depart-ments of His Majesty&apos;s.Government connected with, the Middle East would of
course be -maintained, the mechanical process of the issue of instructions, &amp;c; to: His Majesty&apos;s local representatives would be simplified and expedited.. The Political - Resident&apos; in, the&apos; Rersian Gulf. is already1 in communication with, ;and : under! the&apos;,control of, the Foreign Office in- his capacity as ; consul-general, at Bushire. The Foreign Office proposal,as against that of the India Office does not, therefore, involve an additional channel of correspondence, and should indeed simplify and expedite communication with the Resident on the subjects with which this memorandum is concerned.6. In spite of the above considerations, however, it is not proposed that the Foreign Office should undertake any of the work hitherto or at present performed by the India Office in regard to this part of the world. The duties and responsibilities of the India Office, as they have existed since the adoption of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee in 1921, would remain unchanged and unaffected. The affairs of the Persian Gulf States would continue&quot; to form the subject of the closest inter-Departmental consultation and co-operation as heretofore. All that is proposed is that the duties and responsibilities at present devolving on the Colonial Office in respect of this area should.be transferred, without extension or limitation to the Foreign Office, and that the-duties and responsibilities of the India office should merely not be increased.7. Apart from the above practical considerations, there is a further objection, of a wider and less immediate nature, to the transfer to the India-Office instead of to the Foreign Office of the duties hitherto carried on by the Colonial Office in regard to the political affairs of the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. It lies in the fact that this step would involve an increase in the direct responsibility for this area of the Government of India and of Indian Public Services generally at a time when they are likely to assume possibly in the near future an increasingly Indian character. The India Office has frankly recognised that this Indianisation must come sooner or later, and that, when, it does come, the Persian Gulf work as a whole, being of an imperial rather than of a purely indian character, will have to be removed from purely Indian control. It is open to question how near this eventuality may be, but the process of Indianisation, once begun, may proceed rapidly. The removal of responsibility for policy in the Persian Gulf from Indian control may well, when it comes, give rise to opposition and ill-feeling in India. If, when that time comes, no other Department of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom bears any direct responsibility for the affairs of this area, any transfer of such responsibility to another Department in London will involve a new issue of principle, and will therefore be likely to meet with more vigorous local opposition. If, on the other hand, the principle of direct imperial control by a non-Indian Department of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom (which indeed at present exists) is maintained, even to the present limited extent, any transfer of control will become mainly a question of readjustment of an existing balance and will involve no new issue of principle. It will be possible indeed to carry out the change as gradually and imperceptibly as may be thought desirable, or alternatively, to maintain the present system indefinitely; but, since the present non-Indian element will have been maintained, it will be unnecessary to raise as an issue of principle a question which could otherwise hardly fail to prove invidious and embarrassing.8. To sum up, therefore, the Foreign Office view is that the affairs of the Persian Gulf States are now, as in 1921, of no less concern to His Majesty&apos;s-Government in the United Kingdom than to the Indian Empire, and that their international, as distinct from their local or Indian, importance seems likely to increase considerably. Moreover, it appears probable that the affairs of these States will sooner or later have to be removed, to some extent at any rate, from Indian control. In these circumstances, the most suitable and logical course would be for the Foreign Office to take over the duties in regard to these States which have hitherto been carried on by the Colonial Office, in the same way as it has inevitably taken over the duties of the Colonial Office in other areas of the Middle East, rather than that this moment should be chosen to place a new and added responsibility in respect to a non-Indian area on the India Office or the Government of India, : *.
