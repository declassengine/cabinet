[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1933.SECRET.C.P. 192 (33) Copy No......CABINET.Trade Negotiations between India and Japan.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF. STATE FOR INDIA.In August 1932 the Government of India, in order to protect their cotton industry from intensive Japanese competition, due largely to the fall of the yen, found it necessary to raise the import duty on foreign cotton piece-goods from 3LJ per cent, to 50 per cent. Owing to the Most Favoured Nation Trade Convention with Japan it was necessary to apply increased duties to all foreign cotton goods, although the lower duty afforded sufficient protection against other foreign countries including Italy,. Switzerland and Holland. As the yen continued to fall and the 50 per cent, duty failed to check Japanese imports to the desired extent it became necessary to take further action, but before deciding what action should be taken the Government of India asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should denounce their Trade Convention with Japan in order that they might be free to take action against Japanese imports without unnecessarily antagonising other foreign countries. This was done in April last,, but as six months&apos; notice of denunciation was required all that could be done in regard to other importing countries was to hold out the hope of better treatment at the end of the six months period.When the notice of denunciation of the Trade Convention was given the Japanese Ambassador intimated that his Government desired to enter without, delay into negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government with the object of obviating inconveniences in the trade relations between Japan and India that might result from the expiration of the existing Convention. In the course of conversation with the Ambassador the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs &quot;reminded His Excellency that the fiscal arrangements made from time to. time by the Government of India were not under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government inasmuch as a Fiscal Convention had been established according to which we did not seek to interfere if the Government of India and the Indian Legislature were of one mind.&quot;The Government of India accepted the suggestion that negotiations should be initiated with Japan, but considered that the agreement to be negotiated should be temporary only. Informal discussions have been taking place between the Japanese Consul-General and the Government of India, and I understand it has now been arranged that the discussions will begin about the third week in September.My colleagues will remember that on the 23rd May I circulated a Memorandum regarding the increase of the Indian cotton duties from &apos;50 per cent, to 75 per cent., and it was agreed that no objection should be raised to the action which the Government of India proposed to take. The denunciation of the Trade Convention, followed so shortly by this increase of duties, has excited intense indignation in Japan and there have been threats of retaliation. But nothing has occurred to interfere with the arrangement that an attempt should be made by the two Govern-ments to come to some agreement regarding future trade relations. The negotiations will take place in India, but as His Majesty&apos;s Government is directly interested from the point of view of foreign relations it has been arranged that an observer should be sent from Tokyo to India in order to keep in touch with the negotiations from this point of view, and I have little doubt that he will be able to assist the Government of India in dealing with the Japanese representatives. In order that British trade interests should not be overlooked the Government of India themselves suggested that should any matter primarily affecting British trade arise, a reference should be made to Sir Thomas Ainscough, the Senior British Trade Commissioner in India. As I was not altogether satisfied with this arrangement I referred the matter to the President of the Board of Trade, and although it may be undesirable to give &quot;Sir Thomas Ainscough any definite position in the actual negotiations, I hope, to be able to arrange that he should be kept in close touch with what is going on, so that if any matter affecting British trade should arise he may be in a position to make timely representations to the Government of India.
Side by side with the events which I have described, conversations between the-Japanese Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken place regarding intensive Japanese competition in all parts of the world. It was suggested that, in the first instance/ the possibility of reaching an agreement should be explored by the British and Japanese industrialists themselves, and a note, to which a reply is, I understand, about to be sent, regarding the conditions under which these discussions should take place was handed in by the Japanese Ambassador in May last. This proposal raised many difficulties, as I felt very strongly that any attempt to parcel out the Indian market, or indeed any market in which India was interested, between Great Britain and Japan would be strongly resented in India and might indeed do infinite harm to British trade interests. I felt that in some way or other the Indian industrialists should be brought into the picture, and that so far as the Indian market was concerned, these industrial discussions should be brought into relation with the governmental discussions between Japan and India. As the result of a great deal of -discussion it has finally been arranged that the industrial discussions should be tripartite, and as the Indian cotton market is the key to the position, it has also been arranged that these discussions will take place in India about the same time as the governmental discussions between Japan and India. Further, in order to ensure that in negotiating a ti-ade agreement with Japan the Government of India should not overlook British textile interests, it has been proposed that the Lancashire delegation should be permitted to make representations direct to the Government of India and this proposal, I am glad to say, has been cordially received by the Government of India.Two other questions have been raised by the Japanese. In the course of conversations at the Foreign Office, it was made clear by the Japanese vlmbassador that they would prefer any agreement that may be reached with the Government of India to be not only negotiated but signed in India. I am reluctant, especially at the present juncture, to contemplate any departure from previous practice under which Indian commercial treaties had been signed either in London or at the capital of the other party. I feel that at this stage such a course might be held to imply that some change had taken place in the international status of India and that the responsibility for Indian external relations which rests on His Majesty&apos;s Government had been weakened. I would, therefore, ask the Cabinet to agree that any agreement, arrived at as the result of the Indo-Japanese governmental negotiations, should be signed in London.Secondly, the Japanese have asked for an assurance that any agreement come to in India would be final and not liable to alteration by authority outside India. The Viceroy has suggested that although the agreement would, of course, be subject to the approval of the Indian Legislature, the assurance asked could be given since no agreement could be finally come to in India without reference to me. I do not think that an unqualified reply either in the affirmative or in the negative can be given. For if such an assurance were given, and the fact became known, this might give colour to the idea that an important change in. the international status of India had taken place. If, on the other hand, the assurance were not given, this might be held to be inconsistent with what the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has said to the Japanese Ambassador. I propose, therefore, that our reply should be in the following terms : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are, under the Fiscal Autonomy Convention, no longer in a position to dictate the fiscal policy of India. It is nevertheless the case that they are still, and will continue to be, responsible for the international relations of India. While, therefore, it need not be anticipated that the details of any trade agreement which, as the resxilt of the impending discussions, maybe come to between the Government of Japan and the Govern-ment of India will be liable to alteration in London, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of the responsibility of considering whether the agreement as a whole will affect the international relations of India.&quot;I ask the approval of my colleagues to this formula.It may help my colleagues to see this matter in its true perspective if they can find time to read the appended India Office Note on the trade relations between India and Japan.India Office,20th July 1933.S. H.
India Office Note on the Trade Relations between India and Japan.For very many years up to about 1925, the trade relations between Japan and India were normal and friendly. In 1904, a Trade Convention was concluded between the two countries which provided for most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of customs duties.About 1925, these trade relations took a turn for the worse from which they have-never recovered. The trouble arose simultaneously out of the competition of Japanese cotton goods in India and that of Indian pig iron in Japan. In India the success of the Japanese competition in cotton goods was ascribed to bad labour conditions in Japan, and the Japanese move for protection against Indian pig iron was believed to be connected with the intention to favour Manchurian pig iron in contravention of the spirit if not the letter of the Most-Favoured-Nation Convention.Nothing really serious in the way of tariff increases took place at the time. The only measure taken to check Japanese imports of cotton goods into India was a specific duty on the lowest counts of cotton yarn, which came mainly from Japan, and it was decided at the time not to increase the 11 per cent, duty on piece-goods. The increase of the Japanese duty on pig iron was also not very formidable and did not have any immediate effect on Indian trade. But ill-feeling had been created and there was some talk of retaliation. In each country it was foreseen that the amount of protection granted by the other was likely to be increased.In 1928, Japau having increased her own production of rice, imposed a prohibition of import of rice except under licence, which applied to rice from India and Indo-China, but not from other countries. (Practically no imports of Indian rice were licensed from 1928-31, but in 1932 the trade was allowed to revive to a- fairly substantial extent owing to short Japanese crops.) The reason for the discrimination is understood to be that under the Commercial Treaty between Japan and Siam (the only other large importer) an import prohibition would not be possible. The Japanese claimed that their Most-Favoured-Nation Convention with India, which applied only to customs duties, did not prevent them from imposing a prohibition of imports, and they refused to listen to any suggestion that their action was contrary to the spirit if not to the letter of the Convention.In 1932, the Japanese Government increased the duty on imported pig iron from 10 to 36 sen per 100 kilograms with the declared intention of keeping out Indian pig altogether. This action was believed to be accompanied by a scheme for the grant bounties on pig iron produced in Manchuria which, without involving a technical violation of the Trade Convention, wTould nullify its effect as far as pig iron was concerned.In the meantime, the Indian cotton duties had risen, and though the increases were imposed solely for revenue purposes, they were naturally unwelcome to the Japanese. Then in 1930 the system of differential duties favouring the United Kingdom in comparison with foreign countries was introduced. Japan argued that this was a violation of the Most-Favoured-Nation Convention, relying largely on a fairly impressive argument based on the Japanese text of the Treaty.The position thus was that each country was accusing, the other of violating either the letter or the spirit of the Convention, and it became fairly clear that as a means of regulating the trade between the two countries the Convention had lost much of its value.Finally came the increase of the Indian duty on foreign cotton piece-goods to 50 per cent, in 1932 and to 75 per cent, in 1933, and the denunciation of the Convention on behalf of India in order to make it possible to discriminate in favour of other foreign importing countries against Japan. The denunciation was accompanied by new legislation which gave to the Government of India power to-increase the duties on commodities other than cotton textiles.2. The total value of the trade between the two countries for the five years ending 1930-31 is shown in the appended table. The balance of trade up to 1931 was favourable to India, but in 1932 it was favourable to Japan.A very large proportion of India&apos;s exports to Japan (80 per cent, in the five 3Tears ending 1930-31) consists of raw cotton. A great part of the remaining 20 per cent, consists of other primary products. Of the few manufactured articles exported from India to Japan in substantial quantities, pig iron appears to be the only one that cam
compete seriously with. Japanese products. Japan, on the other hand, exports mainly manufactured goods to India, and during the five years ending 1930-31, nearly 50 per cent, of the exports consisted of cotton goods.Until the present crisis the facts stated in the preceding paragraph would have been taken as showing beyond doubt that for purposes o  tariff warfare India was in a far stronger position than Japan.    The great slump in primary products has -however, somewhat weakened her position, but it is not easy to believe that this is more than a temporary phase.In Japan there has been a good deal of talk of a boycott of Indian raw cotton, but until recently Japan, which in its manufacture depends on a mixture of American and Indian cotton, was undoubtedly nervous as to the possibility of an Indian export tax on raw cotton. It would be a new feature in economic warfare if a country deliberately refused to take the kind of. raw materials best suited to its manufacturers in order to injure the country supplying such raw materials.As regards the effect of a Japanese boycott of Indian raw cotton if this took place--the statistical position is roughly as follows. . About half the Indian cotton crop is consumed in India, and of the total exports about half go to Japan aud most of the remainder to the Continent of Europe. If Japan took less, the demand for goods made from Indian cotton would. continue more or less as before and more Indian cotton would be used in India, on the Continent, and in the United Kingdom (where a movement for taking larger quantities of Indian cotton is on foot). The Indian Trade Commissioner thinks that the new demand on the Continent and the United Kingdom might easily make up for the whole of the loss through Japan&apos;s abstention ; and although this, view may he optimistic, it is clear that the quantity of Indian cotton finding a market annually would be reduced by very much less than the 25 per cent, that Japan now takes.3. It is not.very easy to conjecture what proposals may be put forward as a basis for an agreement between the two countries. .One possibility is an agreement giving Japan a definite quota of cotton piece-goods and perhaps of other commodities to be imported into India, and giving India in return a quota of specified goods (e.g. pig iron, rice and raw cotton, or some of these) to be imported into Japan. It should be remembered, however, that (1) India has never before made any agreement of this kind ; (2) the quota system is in general administratively difficult towork; (3) the exported rice comes mainly from Burma, and with the impending separation of Burma, there is an obvious difficulty about bargaining favours for Japanese cotton goods in India, plus Burma, against favours for Burma rice ; (4) fixed quotas of cotton piece-goods and rice consistent with the-policies of the two countries would presumably have to be comparatively small;.. (5) an import quota of Japanese cotton piece-goods would be open to obvious objection from the Ottawa point of view,, if it were not accompanied by an arrangement for securing the import of substantial quantities of United Kingdom cotton piece-goods ; and (6) India may not be willing to bargain favours for Japanese goods against favours for Indian raw cotton in the confident belief that the latter are not needed.Another possibility is a conventional tariff fixed at rates intended to result as nearly as possible in a specified quantity of trade between the two countries in specified commodities. In the present fluctuating condition of trade it might be extremely difficult to say what tariff rates -would be required in order to produce the desired effect. This difficulty might be met to some extent by providing for the tariff&apos; -rates to be. altered if they did not produce the intended results, but it is not easy to-visualise any such arrangement working smoothly in practice wdiile most of the difficulties attending quota arrangements apply with very much the same force to the-conventional tariff agreement.Failing these methods, an attempt may be, made to evolve a new and improved1 Most-Favoured-Nation Agreement. Even this, however, might be very difficult to negotiate in present conditions of fluctuating prices, and unstable currencies and while the &quot;future of most-favourecl-nation treatment is a subject of international discussion. Nor indeed could the important branches of: trade out of which the present trouble has arisen be adequately protected unless very high or even prohibitive duties were imposed.The above review of the situation seems to point to the conclusion that the-Government of India have acted wisely in asking the Japanese to formulate proposals..
