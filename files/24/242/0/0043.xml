Provisionally the whole of each of these Acts has been included in the Schedule of the draft Bill now circulated.
The Minister of Health has suggested that the former Act (with which is involved Section 4 of the latter Act) might without detriment he omitted from the Schedule; and that, in view of the debate in the House of Lords (20 Dec, 1932, cols- 487 et seqy) on Section 1 of . the latter Act,  it might not be desirable to prolong that Section.    He has requested that the special attention of the Cabinet might be directed to these points.The remainder of the Public Works Facilities Acts, 1930,  (viz.  all except Sections 1 and 4) should in any event be continued.Subject to these points,  the draft Bill has been agreed with all the Departments concerned.(Initialled)    L.H-B.reasury Chambers,  S.W.1.
