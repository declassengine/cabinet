Printed for the Cabinet:  June 1933.SECRET.Copy No.    rk*dCP. 157 (33).CABINET.IN accordance with yesterday&apos;s Cabinet 39 (33), Conclusion 1 (a), Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, I circulate the proces-verbal of the conversations-which the Secretary of State for Air and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had in Paris on the 8th June with M. Daladier, M. Paul-Boncour and Mr. Norman Davis.Foreign Office, June 10, 1933.Record of the Conversations held at the Quai d&apos;Orsay on June 8,1933, at 10-30 a.m. (Received June 9.)Mr. NORMAN DAVIS observed that there appeared to be an unfortunate impression that the British and American delegates wished to press unwelcome proposals on the French Government. That of course was entirely erroneous, and he suggested that at the end of the conversations a communique should be issued stating that the meeting had been held at the request of M. Daladier in order to talk over disarmament problems in a friendly and frank way and so to promote ultimate agreement. He recalled that in Geneva when he and Sir John Simon had suggested Five-Power conversations M. Paul-Boncour had quite properly said that he would not be prepared for such conversations until he knew where he stood with his friends.M. PAUL-BONCOUR observed that in December last the French Govern -ment had agreed to a Five-Power conversation, but this was only on account of the exceptional circumstance that Germany had withdrawn from the Disarmament Conference and in response to the pressing invitation of Sir John Simon and Mr. Norman Davis, and the object of the conversation was to bring Germany back into the conference. Now, however, that Germany had returned, the French Government maintained their objection to a Five-Power conversation. He, of course, had no objection to an exchange of views in a friendly manner amongst certain delegations, provided, however, they were not regarded as a prelude to Five-Power discussions.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that the present meeting could not be held to imply that the French Government agreed to Five-Power conversations or that it was to be a prelude to such conversations. He himself saw no objection to a Five-Power conversation, but before it took place he thought that such a meetings as this was necessary. Five-Power conversations, if they took place, would not be outside the conference; the President and the rapporteur general would attend them.LORD LONDONDERRY said that he was very grateful for the welcome which the French Ministers had extended to him. The idea of this meeting had arisen whilst Sir John Simon was at Geneva and he had to express the latter&apos;s regret that illness prevented him from being present to-day.J. S.Present:M. Daladier.M. Paul-Boncour.M. Georges Leygues.Lord Londonderry.Mr. Eden.Mr. Norman DavisMr. Dulles. M. Massigli. Mr. Campbell. Mr. Cadogan.6919   [8714]
The conference at Geneva had reached a point where it was necessary to seek a closer understanding, and the best means to this end was to ascertain each other&apos;s views. The object of these conversations was to elucidate points dn a manner which was impossible in the conference itself.Mr. EDEN said that he assumed that we were discussing on the basis of the United Kingdom draft convention, and he would be glad to know whether the French Ministers could indicate the more important amendments which they desired to introduce. The United Kingdom Government had tried to produce a balanced draft, and it would assist greatly if they could have a clear indication of the French attitude on the mere important chapters.M. PAUL-BONCOUR observed that the French delegates had already submitted amendments of a general character concerning supervision and security. He imagined that what the United Kingdom Government wished to know was the French attitude in regard to material and effectives.M. DALADIER said that the French Government did not, wish to present a large number of. amendments or detailed criticisms. They wanted us to be clear and if possible to reach agreement on the general course to be pursued in disarmament.The United Kingdom Government&apos;s draft had been carefully studied by the French Cabinet, which had sent instructions to the French delegation on the 2nd May. There had been further Cabinet meetings on the 20th May and again a few days ago, and on both occasions the original instructions had been confirmed.He affirmed the desire of the French Government for the reduction of existing armaments and he observed that without waiting for the signature of a convention, France had already, in the past year, reduced her expenditure by 2 milliards of francs so that it now stood at a figure lower than in 1928.France, however, was ready to go even further, but he must make it clear that further disarmament would be dependent on better guarantees of security. As regards the latter he did not wish at the moment to refer to pacts of mutual assistance or other proposals of that nature; what he had in mind were what he would call technical guarantees. There would be no object in reducing armaments if certain countries were at liberty to manufacture large quantities without being subject to any limitation or control. This was an industrial rather than a political problem. Germany&apos;s industrial capacity was such that she could build up armaments far more rapidly than could France. It was therefore indispensable to institute some means of effective supervision, and he regretted that the proposals recently put forward at Geneva by the French delegation had not been better received. 1 France was quite prepared to agree to reduction of armaments, but wished to be assured that the reductions imposed on all nations would be lay ally executedMr. NORMAN DAVIS observed that M. Daladier had stated the problem very clearly. The&apos;only way to avert the German menace was to keep Germany disarmed, but that would be impossible unless a generalmeasure of disarmament could be agreed. On the other hand disarmament would be useless if Germany were free to build up her armaments surreptitiously. He was convinced that the question of supervision was the crux of the whole&apos;problem and afforded more security than pacts of mutual assistance, &amp;c. - -.!&quot;: It had been difficult for the United States Government to accept the idea of supervision, but President Roosevelt had been convinced that to decree the abolition of aggressive weapons without automatic and continuous supervision would be no solution. ,.. -, .The United States and the United Kingdom equally were vitally interested to prevent Germany rearming and, in the view of his Government, the only thing to do was to keep Germany disarmed and to institute a sufficient degree of supervision to insure that she remained so. 1 . -- M. DALADIER agreed with Mr. Nbrinan Davis and thought that those present would accept what he said when he declared that it was extremely difficult for him to get his Government and his people in present circumstances to accept the idea of reduction of armaments.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said he fully realised the difficulties and did not ask France to do anything that was not in her own interests.   He quite agreed that
we should not proceed to7 really serious measures of disarmament until we could see how the situation in Germany developed. But he thought it necessary to offer Germany a certain disarmament programme, though at the same time it might,be intimated to her that no actual steps would be taken until we were able to judge of political developments in Germany.LORD LONDONDERRY assured M. Daladier that the United Kingdom Government were fully alive to the French point of view; they only wanted to ,evolve an agreement that would preclude the dangers which we all had in mind-He reminded M. Daladier, however, that we had received certain concessions from Germany and he desired to ascertain what reaction these concessions had produced in. the French Government.Mr. EDEN said that everyone appreciated the importance which France attached to the question of supervision and that was why in&apos; the United Kingdom draft convention there&apos; were provisions representing the most farrreaching measures of supervision which had yet received general agreement. He enquired what would be the French attitude in regard to material if the new French proposals concerning supervision could be accepted. We had gained the impression that if we could succeed in inducing the Germans to withdraw their amendments regarding effectives, the French Government would indicate what they would be prepared to do in regard to material. He would not ask that material should be actually destroyed until sufficient time had elapsed to enable a judgment to be formed on the efficacy of the system of supervision. It would be necessary to establish a certain synchronisation. He was anxious for guidance on this point from the French Government and to learn what would be their views on the subject of the periods within which reductions might be effected.M. DALADIER said that the French Government would undertake to cease the manufacture of material and arrest their programmes, and then if it should prove that the transformation of the Reichswehr was being properly effected and that the measures of supervision were working satisfactorily, they could proceed to the destruction of part of the material.The French Government would be prepared at once to stop the manufacture of offensive weapons.During the period of the institution of supervision, there would thus be a truce. If, at the end of three years, the supervision proved to be effective, the French Government might contemplate the destruction of material.He had given rise to some misunderstanding at Geneva when he had spoken of putting material at the disposal of the League of Nations. He had intended by that to mean that the French Government would be ready to hand over material to the League for destruction if the latter should so decide. It was difficult for his public opinion to accept the idea of destruction, but this process of handing over to the League would make it much easier. But before actual destruction was resorted to they must be satisfied that the supervision was working properly. If the French Government had that assurance they would destroy material and would even be prepared to go a step further in disarmament.In the meanwhile he had to reckon with the fact that the political situation was somewhat tense. It was true that Herr Hitler had recently made a pacific speech, but that alone could not efface the many facts which caused the French Government anxiety. They had information in regard, for instance, to the instal-lation of concrete gun platforms in the Black Forest, and they had particulars in regard to activity in German arms factories, and there had recently been export of arms from Germany, notably to South American countries.The fact was that Germany was not at present disarmed. She had been so at one time, but she had gradually renewed her armaments and there had been a recrudescence of activity since the month of&apos; April.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that he was rather surprised to hear M. Daladier say that the French proposals concerning supervision had not met with a good reception at Geneva. He himself had certainly accepted them in principle. But he wished to make it clear that the whole intention of his Govern-ment was to establish a proper, system of supervision in a disarmed world, not to employ supervision simply so as to enable us to decide whether we could proceed to any measures of disarmament. Public opinion in the United States would not support the idea of supervision unless it were clearly and explicitly bound[8714] b 2
up with measures of disarmament. From the practical standpoint disarmament was the only effective way of keeping Germany from rearmament.M. DALADIER observed that by the United Kingdom draft convention, France was already bound to reduce her effectives.Mr..EDEN enquired whether the whole difficulty did not lie in the point of establishing a proper synchronisation.M. DALADIER asked leave to put a question : suppose France accepted the -eventual destruction, say, in three years&apos; time, of part of her war material, and suppose that during those three years the Permanent Disarmament Commission were to discover that Germany had not fulfilled her obligations, what would happen then ?Mr. EDEN replied that it would be open to any signatory of the convention under article 88 to bring the matter before the Permanent Disarmament Commission.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that it was evidently necessary to have some proper supervision for ascertaining whether any of the signatories were not fulfilling their obligations. If it were found that Germany were in this position the other signatories would not proceed with their measures of disarmament.M. DALADIER said that his difficulty was that some signatory who violated the convention might gain an advantage over the.others. At present France had a marked superiority in war material which afforded her a guarantee of her security. France was now asked to give up this margin of superiority and to trust to a system of supervision. What he wanted to know was what the other signatories would do if the Permanant Disarmament Commission found that a signatory had been violating the convention. He had often put this question, but had never received a satisfactory reply.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that with a proper system of supervision it would be possible to prevent one country obtaining a long start over the others. In reply to M. Daladier&apos;s question he referred to the provision in article 88 of the draft convention whereby in case of violation the other signatories should advise as to the situation.M. MASSIGLI observed that the difference appeared to be that M. Daladier on the one hand agreed that at the end of three years France would be able to decide whether she could reduce, whereas on the other hand Mr. Norman Davis desired to know now what France would do at the end of that period of three years provided matters had proceeded satisfactorily in the interval.Mr. EDEN repeated that it was really a question of timing. Suppose there were no destruction of material for three years, then during those three years all Governments Avould be in the same position as they are now. But during those three years it would have been possible to establish and put into operation an effective system of supervision.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that his Government offered France controlled disarmament. Did not the French Government think that they would thus have more security with a controlled disarmament wherein all States co-operated than in a world where armaments were not limited or controlled %M. DALADIER agreed that Mr. Norman Davis had put the question very well, but it was a very difficult question to answer. At the present moment France had a large margin of superiority; if there were no Disarmament Convention and if Germany were to rearm, France could continue to increase her armaments and maintain that margin of superiority. But he admitted that that would be the worst solution, and he would much prefer a controlled disarmament.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that he had hoped that the French Govern-ment might see their way to accepting the naval chapter of the draft convention. He felt that that would have an excellent effect.M. MASSIGLI explained that there were several objections to the naval chapter. In the first place, it did not seem worth while to enter into this agreement for so short a period as two years, for it could hardly be expected that
the Disarmament Convention would enter into force before 1934. Further, the naval chapter limited France to the construction of one single capital ship, namely, the Dunkerque, whilst Germany had three pocket battleships. Lastly, in regard to submarines, a large, though unspecified, sacrifice was demanded of France for which she was offered no compensation. The submarine tonnage that she was asked to sacrifice could not be utilised for the construction of surface vessels.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that he should not have introduced this subject, which was a very complicated one. His Government had certainly thought that the advantages of accepting this arrangement would outweigh any disadvantages. The United States and British naval representatives had discussed the matter with their French and Italian colleagues last year, and had finally made this proposal, which they thought represented a fair arrangement that did not attempt to settle finally the question of parity.At this point M. DALADIER said that he would read to the meeting the report of the discussion which had taken place in the French Cabinet on the 2nd May. The paper which he had before him constituted the instructions to the French delegation, which were as follows : France is resolved to reduce her armaments, but the reduction of armaments must be progressive, simultaneous and general, that is to say, it must apply to land, naval and air armaments.The French Government were resolved on a maximum of disarmament in the spirit of the decision of the 11th December last, which spoke of equality of rights in a system of security.Even in the absence of a pact of mutual assistance France would be disposed to renounce at once as a first stage all construction of guns above 155 millim. calibre and of tanks beyond a total tonnage of 3,000 tons (12,000 tons being the present French figure). This decision would be accompanied by the acceptance of a 50 per cent, reduction in military and naval aircraft. To render possible these measures the convention must contain provisions for 1. Budgetary control and technical supervision of armaments.2. Suppression, or, if that be impossible, strict supervision of private manufacture of and trade in arms. 3. The reduction of all continental armies to a uniform type and theprohibition of extra military formations. 4. Guarantees for the proper execution of the convention.In connexion with the last point, the French delegation were instructed to put the question what the other signatories would do in the event of one signatory violating the convention.If the above conditions were fulfilled, France would undertake after this first stage to proceed either to hand over material to the League for disposal as the latter might think fit, or to any other similar measures in order to realise thus by disarmament the principle of equality of rights. -   .The French Government considered that the convention should be concluded for a period of eight or ten years, dividing this period into two or three stages. Thus the effectiveness of the measures of supervision could be judged and further measures of reduction contemplated.If the convention were to be for five years only, there would be nothing to guarantee that at the expiry of that period certain States would not seek to rearm.M- MASSIGLI explained that the French Government proposed a 50 per cent, reduction of military and naval aviation, and were not inclined to accept the British figure, which involved a much more drastic cut.LORD LONDONDERRY explained that the British figure had been based on the idea of obtaining parity between the principal air Powers.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that the United States Government had been prepared to accept the British figure for the reason that it was based on the principle of parity.M. MASSIGLI objected that the figure did not, however, take into account aircraft stationed overseas.[8714]
Mr. NORMAN DAVIS admitted that his Government had noted this same objection, but he added that it would be necessary to find some fair solution that would suit all three Governments.Mr. EDEN said that he understood from the statement which M. Daladier had just read that, for a period of three years, there would be no further construction, and that, after that period had expired, material would be handed over to the League for disposal. Would that apply to all material exceeding the limits indicated in the draft convention ?M. DALADIER said that it would apply to all guns of a calibre exceeding 155 millimetres. He added that the French Government would never proceed to any actual destruction before the transformation of the Reichswehr were complete and before a system of supervision had been properly established. Those operations might take three years, and during that period there would be no fresh construction. If at the end of the three years those operations had been successfully completed, the French Government could then proceed to destruction of material.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS asked whether, assuming the Reichswehr had been transformed and that supervision were working satisfactorily, there would be a positive commitment on the part of the French Government to destroy material.M. DALADIER replied that they would then begin to destroy it.M. PAUL-BONCOUR interposed&apos; that, in handing over material to the League, France would reserve the right to draw the League&apos;s attention to the grave responsibility that it would be assuming if it were to decide to destroy the material.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS pointed out that this question of handing over to the League raised a big problem. In the first place, it would tend to change the -character of the League and make it a military organisation, and, on the other hand, it raised a particular problem for the United States. The latter were not members of the League, and they could therefore not hand over material to the League. But it would be difficult for them to destroy material if the material handed over to the League were to be kept in existence. He had always had grave doubts as to the efficacy of any such system, and there were material difficulties in connexion with the localities where the material could be stored.(The meeting then adjourned for lunch.)Record of the Conversation held at the Quai d&apos;Orsay on June 8, 1933, at 3 p.m.Present:M. Daladier. Lord Londonderry. Mr. Marriner.M. Paul-Boncour. Mr. Eden. M. Massigli.M. Georges Leygues. Mr. Norman Davis. Mr. Campbell. .Mr. Dulles. Mr. Cadogan.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that the best way to avoid the ultimate German menace was to disarm Germany. For that purpose it was necessary that States should disarm, and disarmament necessitated a degree of supervision. If France were to decide that that was in her better interests, all that his Government desired to do was to help in working out a proper time table.M. DALADIER said that France would always prefer to reduce her armaments rather than see Germany increase hers; but France believed that Germany had, in fact, rearmed to a considerable extent, and for that reason it was necessary to proceed very cautiously by stages and with sufficient measures of supervision.,
Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that he was quite ready to proceed on that assumption. It was impossible to be sure of German good faith, though he personally felt that Hitler had decided that it was in the interest of Germany to get agreement. By showing our good faith we might help him or at least be able to test his good faith.LORD LONDONDERRY said that we should be more concerned with making the conference a success. It was necessary to find acceptable proposals. He was convinced that the French Government were as anxious as any other that the conference should succeed. The German Government had made certain con-cessions, and it seemed to him to be necessary to find some compensation for the sacrifice which they had made. The French Government had suggested that they should refrain from new construction, but in his view it.&apos; was necessary to go further than that, and the United Kingdom Government had provided in their draft convention for the destruction of material by stages, though they were not wedded to any particular periods. If, however, the periods were lengthened, it would be necessary at least to make it certain that by a specific date some definite reduction would have been achieved.M. DALADIER said that he could accept that proposition provided there were a period during which it would be possible to keep a watch on Germany. For the satisfaction of his public opinion, he must have a period during which the system of supervision must be established and prove itself effective. As soon as that had been achieved, he could give undertakings concerning reduction of armaments. The United States and British delegates, on the other hand, had asked him to give these undertakings now with the reservation that he would be free of them if the situation at the end of the period proved to be unsatisfactory. He would reflect on that proposal, and he thought the French Government might be able to accept it, but he must have time to reflect, and there would be no advantage in his accepting now if, after consultation with his colleagues, he had to withdraw his acceptance.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS thanked M. Daladier for his frank statement; he felt that it would have a great psychological effect in Germany if the French Government would adopt a more positive attitude.Mr. EDEN said that no one could guarantee German good faith, but was there not a touch-stone by which it could be judged ? Germany would say that she would require at least five years for the transformation of the Reichswehr. Could we not say that if, at the end of three years, three-fifths of the transformation-tion had been effected, we should then be ready to take the first step in reduction of material.M. DALADIER said that he could not give a positive affirmative answer at the moment to this question, but he believed that if transformation of the Reichswehr were shown to have proceeded satisfactorily, and if supervision were working effectively, it might be possible to destroy a part of the material. This, however, was only his personal view and he would have to consult his colleagues on the point.M. PAUL-BONCOUR pointed out that this first period of three years would be from one point of view the most dangerous. During that time Germany would still retain a large part of her Reicnswehr, and would simultaneously be training a short-term service army.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS pointed out that Germany would not during that time possess weapons of offence, and it was important to do everything possible to prevent her obtaining such weapons.M. DALADIER objected that under the regime of a dictatorship it was easy to plan hostilities in advance and to give the necessary orders to factories.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS said that a proper supervision was the safeguard against this danger. He believed that there was little difficulty on the question of supervision except in regard to two points in the French proposals, namely, the system of quotas and sanctions.M. PAUL-BONCOUR urged that the word &quot;prohibition&quot; should be employed in preference to &quot; destruction.&quot;   He suggested this on account of the
effect the latter word had on public opinion. It might well be that &quot;destruction &quot; might eventually be decided upon, but to talk now of destruction would give rise to apprehension in France,Mr-. NORMAN DAVIS said it was necessary to keep in mind the fact that we had exercised great pressure upon Germany iii inducing her to withdraw her amendments. We had also pronounced very definitely against any German rearmament. It was therefore necessary to offer in return some really concrete concession. In order to keep. Germany on the defensive it was necessary to act fairly by her.Mr. EDEN said that the convention must contain a measure of disarmament; by whatever stages, comparable at least to that which figures in the British draft convention. Otherwise it would be impossible to demand of Germany that she should transform the Reichswehr, and then deny to her even that measure of disarmament on the part of others.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS observed that earlier in the conversation M. Daladier had mentioned budgetary control. His Government had met the French demands on practically every point except this one. He did not know Whether his Government would be able to change their attitude in this respect, but he would like to know what was the minimum required by France.Mr. EDEN explained that the attitude of his Government was the same as that of the United States, namely, that they could accept budgetary publicity but not limitation.M. DALADIER said he would be quite prepared to agree that the United Kingdom and the United States should remain outside the system of budgetary limitation, but he would have to insist on its application to European continental countries.M. PAUL-BONCOUR, reverting to the question of reduction of material, reminded the meeting.that when qualitative reduction was first discussed at Geneva the expression used was the &apos;&apos; abolition of aggressive arms.&apos;&apos; Eventually the General Commission adopted unanimously a resolution submitted by the United Kingdom delegation, which accepted the principle of qualitative limita-tion, and that resolution merely forbade the retention or use of such Weapons by Governments and contemplated the possibility of their internationalisation. M. Paul-Boncour pointed out that, as a matter of fact, the French Government had now gone beyond that, as they were prepared to deal not only with so-called aggressive weapons, but with all weapons which were forbidden to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS, returning to the question of budgetary limitation, said that the United States were reducing their expenditure and they would have no objection to continental countries adopting any system of limitation. For their part, they would agree to complete publicity, and, in fact, a committee dealing with this question at Geneva had recommended there should be a trial period.M. DALADIER emphasised the importance of budgetary limitation as a supplementary check on limitation of armaments. He could understand that this did not apply particularly to democracies like the United Kingdom and the United States, but the situation in countries under a dictatorship was entirely different. .      . -Mr. NORMAN DAVIS suggested that if the material on which money could be spent was limited, it would not matter if one particular Government chose to squander money on what they were allowed to have.M. DALADIER said that the only means of checking the information received in regard to the increase of German armaments was by an examination of the budget of the Reichswehr.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS observed that full publicity would then afford all the check required.M. MASSIGLI enquired whether supervision would be applied also to budgetary publicity. ,;&apos; &apos;
Mr. EDEN explained the reasons for which the United Kingdom Govern-ment were opposed to budgetary limitation. In the first place, Governments such as the United Kingdom which had not built up to its treaty limits would have to put in a figure much higher than that actually expended. This, taken in conjunction with the fact that the Technical Committee had reported that there should be only a global limitation, would really render such limitation practically ineffective.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS raised the question of the period of the treaty. Eight or ten years had been suggested. The United States Government would have preferred ten years, but it would be difficult to get Germany to agree to this without offering her some compensation. On the other hand, if Germany required time to transform the Reichswehr, she might agree to a period of seven years.M. DALADIER indicated that he would accept seven rather than five years. He added that he did not understand why Germany should require so long a period in which to transform the Reichswehr.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS explained that the Germans relied to a very large extent on the Reichswehr for the maintenance of public order.LORD LONDONDERRY observed that the transformation of the Reichswehr should begin at once, and we should expect three-fifths of it to be complete at the end of three years. During that period supervision would have been established and we should be enabled to judge of its efficacy. He understood that at that- moment the French Government would be ready to begin the destruction of material, and in the meanwhile, of course, there would be no new construction.M. MASSIGLI pointed out that France was also called upon to begin at once a reduction of her effectives.Mr. DAVIS observed that Germany had been disarmed in 1919, when the other States gave an undertaking to disarm on their side. If now they were to say that they would not fulfil that undertaking until Germany had disarmed still further, that1 attitude would be indefensible. The United Kingdom draft provided that the transformation of the Reichswehr should be complete in five years, and that destruction of material should begin in one year. We were now talking about deferring destruction for three years. If we were to take the position that there should be no destruction of material until after the transformation-mation of the Reichswehr was complete, he felt that that would be unfair.M. PAUL-BONCOUR said that there was some misunderstanding in regard to transformation, which was not being imposed upon Germany as a more rigorous measure of disarmament, but in order to meet her demand for equality of rights.M. DALADIER also pointed out that the convention would give Germany 100,000 extra effectives, whereas the French effectives were to be reduced.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS replied that numbers were not important. If Germany was prevented from acquiring the weapons now forbidden to her an increase in the number of her effectives need not cause apprehension.Mr. EDEN thought it would certainly be difficult to ask Germany to complete the transformation of the Reichswehr before we undertook any distraction of material. It might be justifiable to demand that the transformation-tion should be more than half complete before destruction was actually&apos; begun, but the two processes must be dove-tailed. We had had great difficulty in securing concessions from the Germans, and it would be very hard now to say that we could do nothing in reduction of material until the transformation of the Reichswehr was complete.M. DALADIER said that he would reflect on the following formula :  France would at once stop construction of new material; when the trans-formation of the Reichswehr had been seriously taken in hand, France might then proceed to the destruction of part of her material, say of guns exceeding 220 millim. in calibre.
LORD LONDONDERRY observed that MV Daladier had indicated a very helpful advance, and he said that further reflection was necessary. He thought that the present conversation had been most helpful and hoped that these exchanges of views might be resumed. The question of supervision would have to be carefully considered in London, and he would represent to his Government the importance which the French Government attached to it.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS agreed as to the importance of a proper system of supervision. It presented many difficulties to his Government, and he believed also to the United Kingdom Government. His own Government had been able to accept it because they had been considering the matter for longer than the United Kingdom, but they would only accept supervision in connexion with actual measures of disarmament.M. DALADIER suggested that three years after the entry into force of the convention France might be prepared to abolish guns over 220 millim. in calibre, and would undertake in the next two or three years to reduce down to 155 millim., or even to 105 millim. On the other hand, there must have been a transformation of the Reichswehr in the first three years, and a proper system of supervision must have been established. In reply to an enquiry as to what he meant by &quot; a &quot; transformation of the Reichswehr, M. Daladier suggested that the period of three years might be increased to four and that it would have to be required that four-fifths of the transformation of the Reichswehr should have been effected by the end of that period.Mr. NORMAN DAVIS thought that if five years were allowed for the complete transformation we should have to be satisfied that the proportionate degree of transformation had been achieved at the end of three years, and the reduction of material would have to be1 corresponding.Mr..Norman Davis raised the question of a further exchange of views, and suggested that the meeting of the Economic Conference in London next week Avould afford an opportunity.M. DALADIER said that he could not stay in London beyond Wednesday of next week, and he was doubtful whether he would have the opportunity of consulting his colleagues before leaving for London on Sunday.He agreed, however, as to the importance of continuing the exchange of.&quot; views, and promised to do what might be possible in this respect.
