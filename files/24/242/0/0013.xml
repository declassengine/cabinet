In considering this question, they will have toexami ne:(i) The nature of the possible misuse of Civil Aviation for military purposes by other Powers, and(ii)    The effects of such misuse upon ourselves.Only &quot;by an examination of these matters can it be deoidedwhether any kind of supervision is likely to be effective from our point of view.3.      In time of war, an enemy could easily use purelyCivil Aircraft to the great disadvantage of our naval forces,if bereft of aircraft and aircraft carrierse.g. for/reconnaissance.....
reconnaissance from land in narrow waters.4.     For these reasons,  it is my duty to bring to the notice of my colleagues, with a view to the iBBue of instructions to our representatives in the Permanent Disarmament Commission, if and when neoessary, the appended memorandum by the First Sea Lord, setting out the serious effects of the abolition of military and naval airoraft on British Naval Strength.(Intld)     B.

45S E 0 H E Tj.,...THE EFFECT OH BRITISH NAVAL STRENGTH OF THE ABOLITION OF ALL NAVAL AND MILI^BLRY ALRQHAFT.Memorandum &quot;by the First. Sea Lord.It may be generally stated that the abolition of naval and military aircraft would have the same effect on aerial war-fare as the abolition of all warships would have on sea warfare... At present we take no notice of the numbers and sizes of ships of the Mercantile Marines of other Powers, but if warships were abolished the strengths of the Mercantile Marines of all Nations would become a vital factor.      Similarly, to abolish naval and: military aircraft would at once raise to a faotor of great potentiality the civil aircraft of all Nations.     In ID or- 15 years&quot;  time civil aviation, with the additional attention that would be paid to it by those who are now mainly employed in creating military aircraft, would be greatly increased and it cannot be doubted that oversea flights and air routes all over the world will &quot;be far more numerous than they are at present. CONTROL OF CIVIL AVIATION.By effective control of civil aviation in peace it could perhaps be assured that none of these aircraft were In any way fitted for naval or military purposes although, presumably, a large number of existing naval and military pilots and observers would be drafted into civil aviation.     No such super-vision, however, is likely to be effective in war, and, even if it were, it would be impossible to prevent purely civil aircraft flying over the seas occupied by our warships, keeping them under observation, observing them on passage, photographing their formations and dispositions and anchorages, and reporting their position.      The report by a civil aircraft of the position and movements of the British Fleet might result in the loss of an expedition^while Submarine attack could be assisted materially.In.......
In the late war the grave disadvantages under which the British i Fleet suffered from being under observation by aircraft was exemplified on 15th August, 1916, when reports by Zeppelins        i enabled the German Fleet in the North Sea to be we.rned of tha approach of the British Forces and to be withdrawn in time. This incident is typical of whet may be expected If an enemy caul use shore based aircraft and the British Fleet, being denied the! use of its Air Arm in any form, is unable to drive them off. Under such conditions the utility of the British Fleet would be   Ivery greatly limited and operations in such close waters as the   11Baltic, Black Sea and Aegean might prove impracticable.- While the above facts are of great importance they io   1 not deal with the even greater importance and menace of the deliberate misuse of civil aviation.     We have at the present time international Haws against the use of gas and against thoImisuse of submarines.      In both those cases it is a fact thatthe possible misuse of these weapons Is foreseen.     It has been stated by the Lord President of the Council in the House ofsard      Commons that the stern test of war will break down conventions,    f Nov:,p.634.and precautions have been taken in equipping military and naval personnel, Nand even important civilian personnel, with gas masks, and the defence of merchant ships by defensive equipment in the case of submarines.      In the event, however, of the misuse of civil aircraft no such adequate counter measures can be taken in peace.     We should, presumably, still retain our anti-aircraft guns but the lack of aircraft carriers and their personnel, and   j of the means of carrying aircraft in warships could not be restored in war within a long period.     During this period not only would our ETavy and its bases, but our Mercantile Marine, be liable to attack by misused civil aircraft against which they would have no adequate protection.     The total abolition of naval and military aircraft, therefore, even if effective measures.....
47      jmeasures for controlling civil aviation in peace could be produced, would seriously affect the efficiency of -the Fleet and the security of our sea communications In war.In March, 1933, the Admiralty laid down, D.C.(M) (32)42, a requirement of defensive aircraft for the Fleet if naval and, military BPffKtNGj1 were abolished.     This defensive &apos;       \^   Iequipment was stated to be to Counter, among other things, the    j misuse of civil aircraft.     If naval and military aircraft were totally abolished, this requirement of the Admiralty oould not      jT&amp;e met. IigUMMAHY..To sum up, therefore   - !Ca)(o)^Cd)MIHALTY.15th June,  1933.The total abolition of naval and military aircraft would be a reduotion of our naval strength, and. reaot more unfavourably on us than on our possible enemies.!fhe abolition of naval and military aircraft gives a far greater potentiality to civil aviation for war purposes and a consequent increased temptation so to use it.Civil aircraft without departing ostensibly from their normal civil duties could be of considerable military value, especially to Hations with extensive oversea air routes and such airdraft could seriously endanger our Naval operations.If civil aviation was deliberately misused, it would be a serious danger both to the Fleet and Mercantile Marine from the very outbreak of war, and no adequate steps could.be taken to deal with it at sea for a very much longer period.(Intld) E.
