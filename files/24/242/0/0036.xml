A.C.  872.CONFIDENTIALBOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL.STATE OP TRADE - JUNE.  1933.Summary of Reports submitted by members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with information from other sources).Employment - The total number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain at 26th June was 2,438,108, a decrease of 144,771 as compared with 22na May.The decreases in the different Divisions were:-London, South Eastern &amp; South Western ...    46,594Midlands................................ 12,039North Eastern........................... 37,783North Western........................... 23,716Scotland................................ 20,466Wales................................... 4,173The estimated number of insured workers in employment at 26th June was 9,793,000, an increase of 135,000 as compared with a month earlier, and of 461,000 as compared with a year earlier.    The improvement was most marked in mining and quarrying, iron and steel, tinplate and metal goods manufacture, engineering, shipbuilding and Bhip repairing, the textile industries, cement, brick and tile, glass, furniture, leather and leather goods manufacture, the food and drink, paper, printing and distributive industries and the transport, hotel and boarding house services.     There was a decline in tailoring, dressmakingj and hat end cap manufacture, and in the motor vehicle industry.Overseas Trade - In June, 1933, imports were  53,774,000 as compared with  57,945,000 in June, 1932;   exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  28,466,000 as compared with  29,724,000;    and exports of imported merchandise were  5,267,000 compared with  4,175,000.
The excess of imports over exports of merchandise was  20,041,000 as compared with  24,046,000 in June, 1932.For the six months ended June, 1933, imports were  320,369,000 as compared with  360,858,000j    exports of United Kingdom produce and manufactures were  176,290,000 as compared with  187,033,000, and exports of imported merchandise were  25,203,000 as compared with  29,330,000.    The value of goods transhipped under bond increased from  10,325,000 to  11,397,000.The excess of imports over exports of merchandise for the half year was  119,876,000 as compared with  144,494,000 for the first six months of 1932.Rail and Road Traffic. -    During the five weeks ending 2nd July, 1933, the net traffic receipts were  152,000 (1.10$) more than in the corresponding period of 1932. Passenger traffic showed an increase of 6.61$, coal, coke and patent fuel a decrease of 9.70$ and merchandise minerals and live stock a decrease of 0.91$.     It should be added that Whitsun fell in June this year and in May last year and this affects the comparison, especially as regards passenger traffic, with the corresponding period of last year.Receipts for the twenty-six weeks ended 2nd July, 1933, compared with the corresponding period of 1932 show a decrease ef 3.92$, the decrease for passenger train traffic being 1.4$ and for the other items 5.95$ and 5.70$ respectively.Registrations of motor vehicles (excluding motor cycles) in May 1933 were 7,593 more than in May 1932, comprising an Increase of 6,660 private cars and 933 commercial and other vehieles.     New registrations of motor cycles in May 1933 showed a decrease of 333 (6.7$) compared with May 1932.
Goal - The average weekly output for the thirteen weeks April 1st to June 24th was 3,788,000 tons which was 5.92^ less   . than in the corresponding period in the previous yoar, and 11,1$ less than in the corresponding period in 1931.     The average number of persons employed for the thirteen weeks ending Juno 24th was 778,000 coinparod with 820,000 for the corresponding period in 1932.     The weekly output per person was 4,87 tons which was ,04 tons less than in the corresponding period In 1932,      Coal exports for the six months ending June, 1933, compared with the corresponding period In 1932 showed a decrease of 864,000 tons, while &quot;bunkor coal showed a decrease of 576,000 tons,     Thore was an increase In the exports to Scandinavia (of well over 500,000 tons) and decreases in a number of markets, especially the Irish Free State,At the momemt there appears to bo a lull in the export market, while inland demand is lower than at tho corresponding period of last year.Iron and Steel - Tho output of pig iron in June, 1933, was 345,600 tons compared with 311,400 tons in June, 1932;    the output of steel ingots and castings was 568,800 tons compared with 459,300 tons in June, 1932,The improvement in the iron and steel industry, which was noted during May, was fairly well maintained in June, though there was a seasonal decline in some departments.     The bettor conditions are attributable in the main to increased activity In the home market which has obtained the hulk of the business available.      There is some revival In Continental competition in semi-finished material and it Is known that the International sales associations recently formed on the Continent are offering
material in this country at prices-appreciably below the official minima*In Scotland there was a slight improvement, but business is still of a day-to-day nature.     On the Korth East Coast the pig iron position is better and stocks are reported to be lowor than for the last three years,     There is no substantial change as regards steel,,     In South Tales, though there has been little expansion in the volume of business, the demand for sheet and tinplate bars is improving^     In Sheffield the demand for stainless steel continuos to increase.     Export trade continues to be seriously hampered by various restrictions *Shipping and Shipbuilding - There was some indication of improvement during June,     The index of freight rates  (1913 - 100) was 77,35 as compared with 74.49 in May, 1933, and with 73,08 a year ago.The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction at the end of June, 287,502 tons, was 35,000 tons greator than that at the ond of the previous quarter, and also 6,800 tons greater than at the end of June, 19328     The tonnage under construction abroad, 445,000 tons, was about 44,000 tons less than at the end of March and is the lowest recorded since December, 1909,Electrieal^ Industry, - The output of electricity by authorised undertakings in June, 1933, was 885 million units as compared with 823 million units in June, 1932, an increase of 7,5$.     For the first six months of the year the output was 6,486 million units, an increaso of 6,4$ on the corresponding period of last year.The percentage of productive capacity occupied remains approximately the same.     Orders for heavy plant were slightly better than for June, 1932, end in recent months the export index has shown a tendency towards a sustained rise.
Motor Industry -   The demand for private cars in the home market continues steady, and July is showing an increase of &quot;business on that usually experienced;    sales of commercial cars, however, continue to he hampered by uncertainty as to the Road and Railway Traffic Bill.    In the export market the abandonment by the united states of ivmerica of the Gold standard has imposed some check on the development of the European markets, and, generally,  retail prices of American cars are showing a tendency towards reduction.     The situation is causing some concern to the industry^Machine Tqolsa    - Lxports of machine tools in June, 1933 amounted to  130,733 compared with  172,705 in June, 1932. Of this  9 5,648 went to the Soviet Union compared with  126,778 in June, 1952.     There are signs of improvement in the steel trade and some of the heavy industries which, it is hoped, may result in some improvement in the home demand. -Imports from all sources during June amounted to .345,416 as compared with  70,829 for June, 1932.O&amp;lk and rayon -     The chief feature in the silk and rayon industry during June was the recovery of raw silk prices, following upon the rise in prices in the United States. The output of rayon for June showed an increase over the previous month, but competition from Japan is still very strong.    The British silk and rayon interests have recently conferred with the other European producers on this subject and a further meeting is to be held shortlyP    The Japanese exports of rayon piece goods other than habutai ( a kind of rayon taffeta) amounted to over 11 million square yards per month for the first 4 months of 1933, compared with about 8 million square yards in the corresponding period of 1932, and about 4 million square yards for the monthly Bricish exports.
4 OQ1 Q 0Cotton&apos;-     Activity was affected by the Whitsuntide holidays which delayed the improvement which might otherwise have resulted from the upward movement of raw cotton Tx-ices, Deliveries of raw cotton to spinners have &quot;been fairly well maintained, the weekly average in June being 23,4 million lbs, against 25 million lbs, in May, and 23 million lbs.  in June 19328   Yarn production was appreciably greater than in June last year.   The export trade in both yarn and oiece goods was disappointing in April and May,  the most serious decline being in the export of bleached goods.Retail Trade -   During the month of May the money value of retail sales was again substantially unchanged   as compared with that in the corresponding month of 1932, a decline of 0o^5 being recorded as against no change in April, The working period in May was, however, longer in 1933 than in 1932, while for April the reverse was the case.    The Food Departments showed a decline of 3. J^S and the non-Food Departments an increase of 0,8$,The V/est End of London showed an increase of 7C 7$ while London Suburbs decreased &quot;by 0,7% , the South of England by Ob 9$, the North of England by 2,2$ and Scotland hy 2,8/4, Almost all categories of merchandise showed increases,  except boots and shoes and the Miscellaneous Departments,    Stocks showed a reduction of 5*1% in value as compared with last year.In Departmental Stores alone trade in May compared with the previous year showed an increase in Great Britain of 5,2$, in the United States a reduction of 2&amp; and in Germany of 19o7$o
Other Industries - Sales of tyres &quot;both home and abroad of all kinds except motor cycle tyres continue to improve. For sports goods the home market has been good, and the export market fair0    In rubber footwear the home demand continues to be good notwithstanding the large stocks of Japanese goods still on hand.    Increasing supplies are reaching this country from Singapore.The position of the soap trade during the six months has been steadily improving.   Margarine consumption fell during the month of June as compared with May, and the first six months of 1933, as compared with a year ago, show a total decrease of over 10%B    Trade in edible oils and fats during the month of June was very good, and the result for the six months of 1933 show a slight increase on the first six months of 1932.   In the chemical trade there are definite signs of improvement in several directions in the home demand, but little change in exports.    Sales of liquid chlorine, bleaching powder and industrial nitrogen products continued to be satisfactory.   Deliveries of sulphate of ammonia in the United Kingdom for the fertiliser year 1932/33 show a satisfactory increase over the previous year, but competition in certain export markets continues.    Creosote continues in good demand from new buyers who formerly used petroleum oils.    There is no material change for the better in the market for pharmaceutical chemicals.FINANCE AND BANKING.(a) London. The money market continued easy in spite of the general uncertainty,    Bill rates hardened slightly in thecourse of the month but eased again at the end.    In the foreign JIexchange market the principal features were the continuedIL
depreciation of the dollar-and the weakness of the Dutch florin.The May Returns for the London^CJleajc^jig-Banks showed an increase of over  11 millions in &quot;Advances to Cus-tomers and Other Accounts&quot;.    This is the first increase of any sigrmJiXcance since the beginning of the world depression.    It may be due to some purely financial transaction, hut it is noted that the first Clearing Bank statement up to June 30th to be published shows an increase of about  5 million in &quot;Advances&quot; as compai*ed with December 1932.    The Provincial Clearings for June are also encouraging as, after adjustment for the extra working day in June 1932, there is a gain of        following one of 2^o for May, the latter being the first rise for six months. ,,(b) Prance - The French Government have passed a Wheat Bill which fixes the minimum price for wheat at Prs.115 per quintal, a figure higher hy Frsc 30 than the current market price.   As no provision, however, is made for buying up surplus production at this price the scheme is not expected to succeed.The difficulties of the Treasury in financing current needs appear to have been overcome, in part by the issue of Frso2,000 million of Treasury Bonds on conditious equivalent to a rate of about 5f&amp;.(c) Holland - The florin rate in Paris has on more than one occasion fallen below gold export point and it was believed for a time that Holland might abandon the Gold Standard.   Action by the Netherlands Bank appears, however, to have heen successful in averting this risk.(d)i Germany - Owing to the prevailing uncertainties, the financial markets have adopted a cautious attitude and practically no change has taken place in money rates or in bond and share price indexes.   There is a definite improvement
in trade conditions notably fts regards steel, coal, potash and cement ,On 9th June an Emergency Decree proviaed for the complete suspension of transfers in respect of the service of all external&apos;debts, except hills falling under the &quot;Standstill Agreements&quot; o    The regulations were subsequently modified on June 30th in a manner more favourable to foreign creditors, Modifications have also been made in the 1933 &quot;Standstill Agreement&quot;;    capital repayments due before 28th February, 1934, are postponed until that date, while interest rates are reduced by approximately -gj,o,(e) UoSoAe   With regard to the depreciation of the dollar, it is difficult to estimate what are the intentions of the American Administration as to the extent to which they may allow the dollar to fall.   The UoS,A. appear to be concerned almost exclusively with their own domestic situation,.   While it is expected that the President will begin to use the emergency powers granted him by Congress, it is reported that there is considerable difference of opinion as to how far these should he used.    The practical difficulties of the application of these powers to industry do not appear to have been fully realised, &apos;  e,Some doubt exists as to whether the increase in business activity is genuine or is based on speculative hopes.   While,for example, the index of retail prices rose in June, that of wholesale prices lagged behind.    Other industrial statistics, however, suggest that business activity has been increasing steadily against the seascnal   trend.    It is thought that it will not be possible to form a definite opinion as to the real vitality of the industrial recovery until the Autumn,Australian Trade - For the 11 months ending May 1933, Imports were  66,742,000 compared with  51,500,000 for the
the corresponding period a year ago;    the export figures were  114,896,000 compared with  98,601,000 (the figures are in Australian currency).   Bank clearances for Sydney from 1st January to 26th June .ere  421,912,000 an increase of  156,688,000 over.last year, and for Melbourne  315,558,000, an increase of  18,406,000.Canadian Trade -   The index of wholesale prices continued to increases, the figures being 66.9 in May compared with 65.4 in April.    The textile group showed a considerable gain, while that in farm products and non-ferrous metals continued.The index of the physical volume of business was 76.4 compared with 69.8 in April, reflecting expansion in a considerable range of industries.    External trade showed a considerable improvement in May as compared with April, exports being just over $46,000,000 as compared with just over $20,000,000 in April, and imports $33,000,000 as compared with just over $20,000,000.
