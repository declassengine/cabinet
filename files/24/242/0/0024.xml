SECRET. Copy No.       3 ICP. 174 (33).CABINET.MALTA.Joint Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.WE circulate herewith, for &apos; the consideration of our colleagues, a memorandum on the subject of Italian propaganda in Malta, and should be grateful for their approval of the course of action suggested therein.JOHN SIMON.P. CUNLIFFE-LISTER.July 4, 1933.Memorandum.IN December 1932 the Cabinet (Conclusions 68 (32) of the 21st December, 1932) authorised measures to deal with the intensive cultural propaganda which was, and still is, being fostered in Malta, both by the present Nationalist Ministers and also by the Italian Government acting through its Consul-General and other agents in the island. This propaganda by the Italian Government, it may be briefly recalled, began to assume an irredentist character over a year ago, and has heeti growing in volume ever since It has taken the form of the opening or extension of purely Italian educational establishments, the foundation of an Institute of Italian Culture, the formation of clubs and Fascist associations, and other propagandist activities.The Cabinet authorised, in particular, the issue of instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome to make it clear to Signor Mussolini that the situation was one which could not be tolerated; that the Governor of Malta would be bound to take steps to deal with it; but that His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped that Signor Mussolini would render such action unnecessary by himself taking steps to put a stop to the propagandist campaign in question. Before, the instructions to Sir R. Graham had been put into their final form, the Cabinet decided, having regard to the negotiations proceeding for the four-Power Pact and to the state of the disarmament discussions, that the moment was inopportune for carrying out the policy laid down. (Cabinet Conclusions 22 (33) of the 29th March.)2. The Governor of Malta has now represented that Italian propaganda is continuing unabated, and indeed is increasing. As, in the meantime, the Four-Power Pact has been initialled, Sir R. Graham was asked on the 9th June whether he considered it opportune to make the proposed representations at an early date. He replied in the affirmative, but asked for a short breathing space after the conclusion of the Pact. He has now indicated that a favourable opportunity may occur in the near future, and has asked for full instructions.3. It is to be observed that since this question was first considered last year, a considerable change has come over Anglo-Italian relations. At that time the Italians were in a suspicious, almost hostile, mood and resentful of what they6947   [8801] bPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1938.
considered (however unjustifiably) to be the somewhat slighting manner in which they had been treated in international affairs. The visit of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Eome in March, coupled with the - successful issue of the Pact negotiations (which could never have succeeded But for the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the mediatory role which they readily assumed and maintained) has invested Anglo-Italian relations with considerable cordiality, and the negotiations themselves have raised the prestige of the Italian Government and of Signor Mussolini.4. This state of affairs should make Sir R. Graham&apos;s task easier, and render less likely such unfavourable repercussions as had been apprehended. These repercussions, it was feared, might take the form of an anti-British press campaign, of retaliatory measures against British institutions in Italy, or of similar measures against British trade. But it can now be represented to Signor Mussolini with great force that it would be disastrous in present circumstances to risk a crisis in Anglo-Italian relations over the affairs of an island on which he himself has said that &quot; no intelligent Italian casts an eye.&quot; Moreover, anything in the nature of an economic conflict would be more likely to damage Italy than ourselves.5. Having regard to this improved situation, and to Sir R. Graham&apos;s opinion as quoted above, the Cabinet is invited to approve the following measures with a view to immediate action on the lines which the Cabinet has already approved. In our opinion, the need for action is even greater than when this question was first submitted to the Cabinet:  (a) The enactment of an Ordinance by the Governor of Malta in the terms of the annexed draft. The ordinance, which it is proposed to keep secret for the present, will not come into operation until a date to be fixed by the Governor. It is to be passed by the Governor in virtue of his reserved powers under the Constitution, by which the general subject of &apos;&apos; aliens &apos;&apos; is made a reserved matter. The effective provision of the Ordinance is Clause 2, and special attention is invited to this. It lays down that, after the date on which the Ordinance comes into force, no alien shall, without a licence from the Governor, engage in certain specified activities, such as teaching in schools&apos; or being concerned in the organisation or management of any institution, &amp;c. The clause contains a proviso which, in order to avoid the infringe-ment of treaty obligations binding on the Maltese Government, exempts from the provisions of the Ordinance any alien engaged in purely commercial activities. It is proposed that if Signor Mussolini refuses to co-operate in terminating the present intensive Italian propaganda in the Colony, the Governor shall bring the Ordinance into operation by Proclamation and apply it by refusing, or attaching conditions to, licences in such a way as to compel the closing or restriction of the institutions to which objection is taken. It is further contemplated that after Sir R. Graham has made his repre-sentations to Signor Mussolini, the Governor of Malta should deliver a warning to his Ministers against the continuance of the pro-Italian tendency of their policy, though, if the representations are successful, we would propose to review in the light of developments the question whether such a warning would still be desirable.(&amp;) The despatch of instructions, of which a copy forms Annex 2 to this memorandum, to Sir R. Graham. It will be observed that Sir R. Graham will be instructed to indicate to Signor Mussolini those propagandist institutions which we want to see disappear (these are, however, confined to the closing down of new institutions and the restriction of old-established institutions to their normal activities as carried on before the opening of the present active campaign). While the matter is thus under discussion with Signor Mussolini, the Ordinance will not be published, but it will be made clear to him that failing an arrangement it will be necessary to publish it on a given date, which, in fact, will probably be one month after Sir R. Graham has made his request. We feel that unless a concrete programme is communicated to Signor Mussolini, with a clear indication that if he does not within a given period express his willingness to carry it
out himself it will be carried out by the Governor, it would be open to him to give a wealth of calming assurances which he might have no intention of implementing and which it would at the same time be necessary to accept. It will further be observed that the winding up or restriction of the institutions to which objection is taken is expected to be completed within a maximum period of nine months, a period which we agree is sufficiently long to avoid serious hardship and not long enough to encourage evasion, (e) It is proposed at the same time to authorise His Majesty&apos;s Minister at the Vatican to act on a proposal of the Governor of Malta that the Holy See should be invited to take steps to strengthen British as against Italian influence in the religious Orders which give instruction in Malta.6. There is a further point to which we wish to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention. The closing down of the Casal Paula School and the restriction of the Umberto School will deprive about 150 Maltese children of the secondary education which they have been receiving there. The action of His Majesty&apos;s Government may be open to some local criticism if they do not take steps to provide alternative facilities for these children. It is not sufficient to suggest that the Maltese Legislature should themselves provide these facilities, as they would retort that there is no reason why the Maltese should tax themselves to supply educational facilities which they are at present receiving gratis from the Italian Government. If His Majesty&apos;s Government see fit to close Italian schools which are voluntarily dispensing education at nominal fees, they should at least provide equal facilities themselves without charge to the Maltese Exchequer. The question is at present under consideration, but it may be necessary to make other provision for the purpose. Having regard&quot; to the comparatively few children involved, the cost should not be excessive.J. S. P. C.-L.July 4, 1933.I 8801 J

ANNEX&apos; 2.Draft Despatch to Sir R. Graham., Rome. Sir, July    , 1933.IN your despatch No. 826 (169/70/32) of the 14th October, 1932, your Excellency reported your conversation with Signor Mussolini on the subject of Italian propagandist activity in Malta. Your Excellency observed that Signor Mussolini seemed surprised, though impressed, by your representations, but said that he found it difficult to take the matter as seriously as you appeared to wish that he should. (I would recall that Signor Mussolini held very similar language when, on the 25th March, 1924, your Excellency drew his attention to the attempt at that time being made to secure the appointment of a Bolognese Professor to the Chair of Italian Literature in the University of Malta.) You added, nevertheless, that the head of the Government took your Excellency&apos;s remarks in good part, and undertook to inform himself of the activities to which you had referred. It is to be feared, however, that Signor Mussolini has not as a result of your Excellency&apos;s representations exercised any restraining influence on Italian propaganda in Malta, since it is, I regret to state, only too clear that the Italian cultural movement in the Colony, far from abating as a result of Signor Mussolini&apos;s undertaking to investigate the matter, continues to be pressed forward with ever-increasing vigour.2. Your Excellency received under cover of my despatch No. 1067 of the 4th November, 1932, a copy of Sir David Campbell&apos;s secret despatch of the 25th October, which enclosed a table of the Italian Institutions in Malta, together with some brief notes thereon. You will observe that all the institutions or associations mentioned therein have, with the exception of the Umberto I secondary school (founded in 1913) and the Fascist General Club (founded in 1924) been established since 1929, and that some of the most important (including the Institute of Italian Culture) have been inaugurated even within the last two years. These educational establishments, for admission to which negligible fees or no fees at all are charged, are in no sense self-supporting, and the necessary funds for their maintenance are sent from Italy, through the Italian Consul in Malta. It is, moreover, a fact that all children attending the Italian schools in Malta are required to give the Fascist salute on entering each day. Further information indicates that new Italian schools are projected at Senglea (where a site has been acquired) as well as at Sliema, Hamrun and Birchichara, while the foundation of a technical school is also, I am informed, in contemplation. The latest information available on this subject is contained in a &quot;review of Italian propaganda,&quot; compiled by the Governor in February (enclosure No. 1 in this despatch), and in a note forwarded by Sir D. Campbell on the 29th May (enclosure No. 2).3. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the conclusion which they are bound to draw from these various reports is none other than that the increasing and unblushing propaganda carried out on behalf of the Italian Government in Malta has become a definite menace to the authority and prest Age of the Imperial Govern-ment, and if allowed to continue unchecked may, by undermining the loyalty of the Maltese people, ultimately constitute a threat to the Imperial connexion. In these circumstances it has been decided that the time has now come when strong action must be taken to put a stop to these dangerous activities.4. Your Excellency will have noted from the enclosure to my despatch No. 1067 of the 4th November, to which reference has been made, that the Governor of Malta suggests that for this purpose he should be vested with suitable powers to deal with propaganda which may broadly be described as purely educational in intention. The Governor is being given these powers, but before he is authorised to exercise.them His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to make an appeal to Signor Mussolini, in the hope that by taking action himself he will render such measures unnecessary. I request, therefore, that you will take an Jearly opportunity to seek an interview with Signor Mussolini, and, reminding him of his undertaking of last October, impress upon him that the propaganda in question has persistently increased since 1929 and is still increasing; that His
Majesty&apos;s Government are perfectly aware that it is carried on not merely with official encouragement from the Italian authorities, but also at the direct instance and expense of the Italian Administration; that its continuance is out of harmony with those close and friendly relations which exist between Italy and Great Britain, and which it is to the common interests of both Governments to foster and extend; that it would be disastrous if these relations were to be prejudiced on account of the affairs of an island on which, as Signor Mussolini has himself assured you, no intelligent Italian casts an eye; and, lastly, that in view of this assurance His Majesty&apos;s Government are confident that the situation has developed without Signor Mussolini&apos;s knowledge, and that he will find no difficulty in curbing the zeal of his subordinates to the extent necessary to ensure that Anglo-Italian relations shall continue undisturbed.5. Meanwhile, it has been decided, in case Signor Mussolini should unfortunately reject this appeal, that the Governor of Malta shall forthwith enact (but shall not yet publish or apply) an ordinance to render it impossible for aliens to establish or to teach in schools, or, indeed, to engage in any occupation (other than commercial) in the Colony without a special licence from the Governor. The kind of propaganda which is illustrated by the foundation of the Institute of Italian Culture and the admission of British Maltese subjects to the Italian Fascist organisations will be dealt with by attaching to the grant of licences to aliens the condition that no British subject shall be eligible for membership of the institution to which the licence refers. A copy of the Ordinance forms enclosure No. 3 in this despatch.6. Your Excellency will inform Signor Mussolini of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take these precautionary measures, but in doing so you will lay stress on the fact that, whilst the Governor is thus being given the necessary powers to maintain the authority of the Imperial Government in the Colony, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel confident, in view of the assurances which have been given to your Excellency in the past in regard to the aims of Italian policy in Malta, that they can count on the goodwill of Signor Mussolini to find means of his own of closing down or -restricting the activities of the various clubs, institutions and associations in such manner as to render it unnecessary for the Governor to exercise these powers.7. The measures which His Majesty&apos;s Government consider essential in order to restore Italian cultural work in Malta to its proper place in the life of Malta, such as it occupied before the present propaganda was launched, are the following : (a) The Institute of Italian Culture which was inaugurated in February1932, shall be completely closed within the next three months.(b) The Casa Paula School opened in October 1932 shall be closed withinthe next nine months.(c) The Umberto I school shall be restricted to its scope and extent prior to1932, with the added stipulations that the British subjects amongst the pupils must not exceed 50 per cent, and that 25 per cent, of the teaching staff must be British subjects, such reorganisation to be completed within the next nine months.(d) The undermentioned institutions shall continue only on the condition that no British subject shall be eligible for membership, and that the British subjects, who are members at present, shall withdraw within two months : (1) The Fascist Club.(2) The branch of the Avanguardisti organisation in Malta. (3) The branch of the Balilla organisation in Malta.  .(e) No new Italian schools or institutions shall be founded. ;8. The time limits indicated above should, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be sufficiently long to enable Signor Mussolini to take the; necessary action without causing serious inconvenience. And in the case Of the Institute of Italian Culture, Signor Mussolini&apos;s statement to you that.it was in the lowest of financial waters should make it all the easier for him to withdraw it.   &apos;; i :!9. You should inform Signor Mussolini of the above programme which you are also authorised to communicate to him in writing, for his confidential
information, in whatever form you think best. In doing so you should make it clear that unless he is prepared to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government in terminating the present intensive Italian propaganda on the lines suggested, the Governor of Malta will be bound to have recourse to the Ordinance on a given date in order to ensure the execution of the programme. It is suggested, subject to your Excellency&apos;s views, that this date should be one month after the date of your representations to Signor Mussolini. If on the other hand Signor Mussolini is prepared to co-operate with His Majesty&apos;s Government the Ordinance will of course remain a dead letter.1.0. Your Excellency should also avail yourself of this opportunity to draw the personal attention of the Head of the Government to the matter which forms the subject of the correspondence terminating with your Excellency&apos;s despatch No. 958 of the 2nd December last. You should inform him that His Majesty&apos;s Government understand that a doctrine and practice exist according to which the words in paragraph 2 of article 17 of the Italian Nationality Law of 1912 &quot; Italians not belonging to the Kingdom &quot; are interpreted as establishing a distinction between &quot;political&quot; Italy arid &quot;geographical&quot; Italy (the latter including the island of Malta), and are held to entitle the Italian Government to recognise the possession of Italian nationality in persons who happen to have been born or reside in the latter regions, and you should urge that in order to obviate possible misunderstandings and difficulties this practice should be abandoned forthwith so far as British Maltese subjects are concerned.o
