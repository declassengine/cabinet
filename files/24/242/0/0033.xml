C.P.163(33).

PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL TRAWLING.

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Serious complaints are being made as to the prevalence of illegal trawling by British vessels off the coasts of Scotland and I am being strongly pressed in the House of Commons to provide suitable remedies. This pressure is practically certain to increase unless a satisfactory assurance as to the Government&apos;s intentions is given.

I am satisfied that an increase in the existing penalties for illegal trawling and associated offences in Scotland is required. I intend to submit a Bill to the Cabinet in the autumn after consultation with the Departments concerned.

In the meantime I ask the Cabinet to authorise me to make a statement, before the House rises this month, in the sense that the Government propose to take legislative action in the matter next Session.
