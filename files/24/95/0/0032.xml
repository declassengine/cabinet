                                               Mr..  Longhurst.POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,          FOREIGN OFFICE.%                      EUSSIA/028.                              MEMORANDUM                                     ON   RELATIONS BETWEEN THE ESTHONIANS AND  THE RUSSIANS.    THE collapse of  General Yudenich&apos;s  army as  a fighting force against theBolsheviks and the negotiations between the Esthonian and Soviet Governments atDorpat make it  important to  review  the  present  situation in Esthonia and therelations of the  Esthonian Government with both  Bolshevik  and anti-BolshevikRussia.1. Internal Situation in Esthonia.    The internal situation  shows no  signs  of  improvement.   There have  beennumerous strikes in Reval, and prices continue, to be  very high.  There is not enoughmoney for  internal circulation.  The  Esthonian  mark is  not quoted in any other country, and it is calculated that Esthonia needs a foreign loan of 4,000,000/. a year.On the 19th November  a new Government was formed under M. Tonnisson, one ofthe leaders of the National Party.  Most of the members of M. Strandman&apos;s formerGovernment have remained, but M. Poska has been succeeded by M. Birk  as Ministerfor Foreign Affairs.   The latter also  belongs to  the National Party, and the  new government, therefore, is slightly to the Right of the former one.  It is difficult tosay how  far this will mean a stiffer attitude towards the  Bolsheviks, as the actionof any Esthonian Government in this direction will chiefly be  affected by the attitudeof Western Europe.  It is probable that M. Tonnisson will endeavour to compromisewith  the Socialists, who  desire immediate peace with the Soviet Government, byagreeing to an armistice  without concluding peace.   The  one thing the EsthonianGovernment appears to be unwilling to agree to is a continuation of the fightingduring the winter, owing to the weakening  in the moral of the Esthonian army.This  is shown by the proclamation issued  by  General  Laidoner, the EsthonianCommander-in-chief, in which  he stated that it was  not true that the officers desired the continuation of the war in  order to keep paying  jobs for themselves.    It is difficult to see how any arrangement made with the Soviet government can really  benefit the  country.   Reval, for example, owes  its  prosperity almostentirely to its trade with  Russia, and until  Russia is restored to proper economicconditions  it will be impossible for Esthonia herself to recover.   All the RussianBorder States will have sooner or later  to recognise these hard  facts and to make up their minds that some  form of co-operation with the Russians is as essential tothem  as it  is to the Russians.   If Russia cannot  get rid of Bolshevism without the help of the Border States, it is equally true that the Border States cannt)t get onwithout Russia.2. The Anti-Bolshevik Russians and Esthonia.    General  Yudenich started his advance on Petrograd on the 8th October.   Forthe first fortnight all  went  well, and he advanced to the outskirts of Petrograd.On the 28th October he began to lose ground, Krasnoye  Selo being recaptured bythe Reds.   Meanwhile negotiations had been going on for Finnish military aid,through M. Lianozov, the Prime Minister of the now defunct North-West Govern-ment. The Finnish Government finally refused on the 5th November, when Yudenichwas already in retreat.  On the 12th  November,  Yudenich had lost all the groundgained in his offensive, and began to withdraw from Yamburg towards the Esthonianfrontier.  Both Yudenich&apos; and the Esthonian  Government were then faced with an extremely difficult problem, namely, the disposal of  the Russian army and the largenumber of refugees that  accompanied it.    The Esthonian Government were very  unwilling to, have the Russian  armyfoisted on them, in view of the coming negotiations with the Bolsheviks.  It was clear  that one of the principal demands made by the Bolshevik  delegates would be[This Docament  ia fchtv Property ftf ate Bhfeamuc Majesty s Govemmeat] A
 the removal of Yudenich&apos;s troops from Esthonian territory.  The negotiations were at first conducted by Yudenich with Laidoner, the Esthonian Commander-in-Chief, who has always shown himself  extremely well disposed towards the anti-Bolshevik Russians.  But Laidoner was not able at first to get the support  of the Esthonian Government, and Yudenich was driven to the conclusion  that he would have at all costs to maintain himself on a small part of Russian territory outside the frontiers of Esthonia. After protracted negotiations with  the Esthonians, however,  it  now appears  that the Russian troops are  to be placed under the command of General Laidoner, and that General Yudenich will go abroad. The one thing the Esthonians have refused is to allow Russians from bermont&apos;s army to come from Courland  to Esthonia to join the remnants of Yudenich&apos;s army.      To do the Esthonians justice, it is not surprising that  they should have hesitated to give hospitality  to Yudenich&apos;s  army.   Yudenich himself  has  behaved quite honestly, and has kept faith by the Allies, but there have been  numerous intrigues amongst his subordinate commanders.  General Rodzianko, good soldier though he is, has been very unsatisfactory, sometimes working with Yudenich and sometimes listening to German influences, which have always been fairly strong in sections of the army.  General Arseniev, for example, who  was employed by Yudenich  in the advance on Petrograd in order that he might not intrigue in the rear, is reported to have betrayed Yudenich during the advance by not giving the expected support to his right flank.  In addition to military intrigues against him Yudenich suffered- from the political  intrigues of  Margulics  and other representatives of the North- West Government, who have now been expelled from Esthonia  on the ground that they were speculating in the Russian rouble.  In view of these influences which have been continually at work it is not surprising that  Yudenich failed, in spite  of the loyal support he received from other  commanders such as Generals Glasenapp  and    The other question on  which an agreement  has been  concluded with the^sthonians is that of the refugees who returned with Yudenich during his retreat.These refugees are said to number about 12,000, and their condition is pitiable.  Atfirst the Esthonians only allowed them to cross the frontier at the rate of 40  a day,but they have now allotted them a fair-sized area,  and an International  Commissionof a purely humanitarian character has been appointed  to look after them.B.  The Soviet  Government and the Esthonians.    General Yudenich &apos;s advance on Petrograd postponed the negotiations for peacewhich had opened at Pskov in September, when Litvinov came as the chief represen-tative of the Soviet Government.  When  it seemed possible that Yudenich  might take Petrograd the Esthonians became alarmed lest by their negotiations with theBolsheviks  they  might imperil their relations  with   the  future  anti-BolshevikRussian Government.  It was not until Yudenich was finally defeated that the nego-tiations were resumed  at Dorpat on the 5th December.  Notwithstanding the factfchat the Esthonians had joined Yudenich in attacking the Red armies, the  SovietGovernment was  so anxious  to  obtain peace that  they accepted the  Esthonianp&apos;explanations and  sent  their representatives to Dorpat.   The Bolshevik represent?-&apos;jves  are  Krassin  (Commissar  of  Trade and  Commerce), Joffe  (former  soviet ambassador in Berlin), Litvinov (assistant to Chicherin at the Soviet Commissariat:for Foreign Affairs), and Radek, who  is now on his  way to Dorpat from a German.prison.   M.  Poska, former  Minister for Foreign Affairs, is at the head  of theEsthonian Delegation.    Since the former  negotiations with the Bolsheviks the  attitude of the  baltic states  towards peace appears to have undergone a change.   Before Yudenich&apos;sadvance Latvia and Lithuania were prepared to co-operate fully with the Esthoniansin the negotiations  with the Bolsheviks; in the present  conference neither the Lettsnor the Lithuanians are  participating.   Lettish  representatives are in Dorpatmerely to follow the proceedings,  while the Lithuanians have not even sent delegates.The explanation of this appears to be pretty simple.  The Esthonians  have  had tobear the brunt of  Bolshevik attacks much more than  the Letts and Lithuanians, andthe moral of the  Esthonian army is worse.   The  Letts and Lithuanians have hadother enemies  whom they feared  more  than the Bolsheviks, and it was only becauseof the German menace that  they contemplated peace  with the Bolsheviks.   TheGerman forces are now in headlong  retreat, and the  Letts and Lithuanians areelated.  For the  moment,  therefore,  they are paying  less attention to  Bolshevikovertures for peace.        -.
     It is too soon to say what  will be the result of the negotiations between theEsthonians and the Bolsheviks.  The former want nothing more than an armistice,i.e., they want to take up the  same position  towards the Soviet  Government asFinland; the Bolsheviks, on the other hand,  desire a full treaty of peace which willgive them an outlet to Esthonian ports, and thus save them from the blockade.     It is unlikely that the peace negotiations will lead to any final result. In viewof the note from the Supreme Council in Paris to the Esthonian Government asking them to take no drastic action against Yudenich&apos;s troops until the Allied Govern-ments have  considered the matter,  the  Esthonians cannot agree to the  conditions imposed  by the  Bolsheviks  that  these troops should be expelled  from  Esthonianterritory.  The Esthonians are now faced by a further difficulty.  Apparently it was thought in Esthonia as elsewhere that the Litvinov-0&apos;Grady Conference  at Copen-hagen might lead to a change in the attitude of His Majesty^ Government towardsthe Bolsheviks, but it must now be clear to them that this is not the case, and if theycontinue  the negotiations with the  Bolsheviks they will find themselves completelyisolated.   They cannot expect to get conditions from the Bolsheviks  which would place them on the same footiaig as Finland, as  the  Bolsheviks&apos; main  desire  inconcluding peace with them is to overcome the blockade, and a mere armistice which did not give them the right to use Reval would be of little value to them.     December 16, 1919.
