SECRET,                               C A B I IT. ^ ,T. 0&apos;t P. 37 3 *                       &quot;Decontrol of hnne-firewn meat&quot;.           Memorandum,&quot;by the minster of Agriculture and Fisheries.^.vcs           ^ The Cabinet has already deoided to remove all      restrictions en the aale of imported meat and that control of milk      and other dairy products chould cease at the end of January,                I now ask for a further decision that oontrol of British      meat of all kinds? should cease on the same date,  thus freeing,      simultaneously, all agricultural produots except wheat.                Under existing regulations prices have been fixed for      home-grown meat up to July 6th and I am aware that many farmers      press strongly for the maintenance of these prices and the literal      observance of the promise made by the Ministry of Food - just as      others  cling to the maximum prices fixed for milk.   It is my      deliberate opinion, however, that oontrol is exercising a      prejudicial and deadening effect upon the development of      agriculture and that the industry will never  regain its vigour      and enterprise  until farmers are face to face with  the risks and      rewards of the open market and  the free play of economic forces, so      far as  they are compatible with  the national interest.   In this      connection I should find it difficult to justify action by  the      Government in the direction of withdrawing tho prices fixed for      milk alone or for meat alone, but I am convinced that I oan properly      ask farmers to accept the ricks involved in decontrol of      individual articles if I oan announce a broad general policy of      decontrol of all agricultural produce, except wheat.                In any case I regard  the present controls  as offering      a fallacious security to the farmer and as dangerous to hie      interests.   The official milk prices must break down under the      excess  of supply,  whilst the prices that are promised for  cattle,                                  .    1.   T                                                                 ........  ^
    however  favourable,  do  not  oarry with  them any&apos; assurance of a    market,    The  position  of  the farmer with fat  cattle  to sell in May    and  June may be  very unenviable if  the Hinia-try of Food do not want    them at  the prioe  -  an  may  well be  the oase in view cf the surplus    of imported meat,    Cnly his best beasts may be taken and there will    be no outlet for the lower grades ainoe  they cannot be sold at    competitive price?.              On  the other  hand, if meat is  decontrolled, I anticipate    that prices will rise for  some of the  farmer&apos;s best produce - the    beat qualities of  beef, perk and lamb, for example, but the prospect    of  theae better  prices  for  special  quality form the proper and only    compensation  that  couli be  offered  to  the producer for cancelling    the  bargain which has been  made with him.   Further,  I regard these    better prices  in certain  cases, e.g, pigs, as  the necessary    inducement to  the  farmer  to begin to breed freely.    If it were    known that control would  be removed in January it should be possible    within the year  to recover the decline of nearly  one  third  cf its    numbers  that  the pig population has suffered.   I therefore  submit    that, in the  interests  both of  the  producer  and the  consumer, the    time has come  to complete  the removal  cf all  restrictions  on  the    sale of  agricultural produce  (except  ttate$&amp; wheat)  by    decontrolling  home produced meat aB from January  31st.              As  the matter is one  of great  urgency I ask for  a very    early decision of the  Cabinet,                                       L.  of F.at January,  1920.
