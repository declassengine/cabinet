(this  Document is  the Property of363His  Britannic  Majesty^ Government.)Military Secret.1243MR. C.LONG&apos;HUftS&apos;V    2Uh December 1919.(Received 4th. January 1920.)^^^f72?)6.  Following from Malleson&apos;s telegrams dated 24th December :      (1) Frontier telegram  dated  23rd  December states that Bolsheviks in Askabadhave announced that their forces are now  close to Krasnovodsk, and that remainder of volunteer army are embarking hastily.  Repeated  Teheran,  Kasvin, Baghdad,Constantinople and Taganrog.     (B) With  approaching fall of Krasnovodsk the tone  of  Bolsheviks  in  Trans-Caspia is becoming more  truculent and threats against  the British and Persian are increasing.  In some parts of Khorasan frontier there are (? rumours) of Bolshevikarmed incursions.  Small  raids  are possible, but  season  is unsuitable  for largeroperations, nor are Bolsheviks yet organised for enterprises  (? at a)  distance fromrailway.   Repeated to Teheran.     (3) According to latest arrivals from  Samara via Tashkend (2 corrupt groups)railway is now sufficiently repaired  to admit of through running.   Progress is slowowing to  defective locomotives and rolling stock, and also to  faulty track and shakytemporary bridges.  Trains take  about 14 (? omission) Tashkend.  Numbers  oftroops are coming through, but  fuel  is  still very scarce.   Repeated  to  Teheran,Baghdad, Constantinople, and Taganrog.     (4) Following appeal  according   to to-day&apos;s  wireless has  been  issued  fromvolunteer headquarters by Denikin : &quot; At present time when army is making everyeffort, and with its breast defending Russia against the mad onslaught of her enemies,numbers of  officers are hiding in refuge.  I therefore  order all officers to report atthe front immediately.   Those who fail to do so will  be sentenced to be shot.&quot;     2. I  am endeavouring to utilise this and previous  appeals (corrupt group) to persuade some of Russians here, who are a nuisance and potential danger, to go to thefront. They have always  been bitterly jealous of our presence in Northern persia and with  our  reported  change of attitude on Russian  question are likely to become very hostile.  Repeated to  Teheran.
