mvmi I&amp;JM mm^Y oi  his mfiu  ^gsig  goybkkmbnt).     I desire to suggest. that, tne Cabinet should authorise -a3 a permanent ar j angeraent -..the addition to its Secretariat  of aseconded member of the Treasury staff,&quot; the period of secondingin the case of any individual officer being normally three years.This officer should be an Assistant Secretary on the TreasuryEstablishment, but would of course be responsible to,  and underthe orders of bir Maurice Hankey.  v/hile he would be available forgeneral service in the Cabinet Secretariat, his primary functionwould be to act as liaison officer between the secretariat and the Treasury in which capacity it would be one of his duties,under the directions of  Sir hi, Hankey, to ensure that memorandawhich reach the Secretariat from i:ublic Departments for circulation to the Cabinet have beeh under review - in their financial aspects  -by the Chancellor of the Exchequer prior to circulation.     It is very desirable to resume the old-establishedarrangement under which x^ublic Departments were accustomed to threshout with the Treasury - from the outset - proposals whioh may in-volve charges upon the Exchequer;  and I hope that my colleagues will agree with me that the necessity for this oourse should  be impressed upon JJepartments.     ivly suggestion to add a Treasury man to Sir a. Hankey&apos;staff will provide a safeguard where this preliminary has beenignored and&quot; will assist his hard worked office in their endeavours to prevent what not infrequently happens, namely, the circulation to the Cabinet of papers advocating heavy expenditure whioh neitherthe Chancellor of the Exchequer nor the Treasury have ever heardof.  The re-establishment of Treasury control is a mere figure of speech if the Treasury has been consulted  at no point during the evolution of proposals and the circulation of memoranda embodyingthose proposals for discussion by the Cabinet is the first intima-tion the Chancellor of the Exchequer has of them.     I suggest tnat a circular letter be addressed to Depart-ments by the Cabinet explaining the principle I have just enunciatedand informing them of the addition to the staff of Sir u.Hankey.     This proposal has been discussed between the becretaryof the Treasury and bir ^aurice Hankey, who warmly welcomes theproposal.CaJ I U E 5?.322-KEPhSSSMMJQH 01&apos; ThN the^SUhY Oh THE frrClxTiihlAT              01&apos; TKS QiiBIi-lflr.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(Intd)C.Treasury, S.
