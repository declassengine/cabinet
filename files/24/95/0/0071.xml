iv faThis Document  is  the Property ofH&apos;3 Britannic Majs&apos;3*v&apos;s Gjvemfneju.From Viceroy, (undated).(Received 31st December, 11.45 a.m.)    1737 S.  Afghanistan.  Reference to our telegram dated 22nd November, 1583 S.Amir has now addressed to me letter dated 9th December enclosing copy of his letterto Grant.    In his forwarding letter Amir refers to letter dated 16th October  from Grant tohim.  Amir says that  he thought this  letter gave him opportunity to  commencediscussions between two Governments on frontier matters and commercial  and  other questions which remain unsolved.  - Therefore  he addressed to Grant  letter of which he now encloses copy to me.   Amir goes on to say I shall be able to judge from his letter to Grant  how sincere he is in his desire to remove unpleasant discussions andlay the foundation of friendship.   He ends  by expressing the earnest desire of hisGovernment and nation to conclude agreement of friendship.    Grant&apos;s letter of .16th October was merely polite  acknowledgment  of Amir&apos;sletter to  him of  10th September (copy forwarded  to you with my Foreign Secretary&apos;sletter No. 76 M.  of 26th September).  Grant  in that acknowledgment concluded by saying that he hoped that relations of friendship and co-operation would be established between officials on both sides of  the border, and said that, as  Chief  commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province, he would attend promptly to any representations on frontier matters made by Afghan Government or officers. -  Amir  has apparentlydistorted meaning of this letter in [word omitted) ing it as  an invitation to negotiateabout common frontier and the settlement with our tribes.    I shall telegraph in due course my proposals for a reply.
    I circulate to my colleagues  the  enclosed proposals  for dealing with theTerritorial  Force, Special Reserve, and Reserve  of the Regular  Army in theyears immediately before us.  They form a part of a normal peace-time army ofapproximately  62,000,000  per annum.     I would ask that sanction should be given to them in  time to allow of theirannouncement to the  meeting  of the  Territorial Force Associations which has.been called for 15th January.
