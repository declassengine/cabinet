Your 4879 of 12th December.  Following information is additional tothat &apos;given  in  para.  4  of our  1648 of 28th November  and para. 6 of our 16351 of 5th December.  Attack on train occurred on evening of 1st December four miles fromThai,  where line was broken up and engine derailed.  Train carried escort of 27 Indianrank and file with  two Lewis guns.   Heavy fire was opened on derailed  train fromclose quarters and raiders having disposed oil escort (who lost 10 killed and 16 wounded)looted train and passengers.   Firing  was heard at Thai, and two troops of  Cavalryand 40 Militia Infantry were  despatched  immediately up Sangroba  Nullah to interceptraiders.   One  company of  movable  column  was  also  despatched  with   medicalassistance in motor lorries to scene of action.   Remainder of Kurain Militia proceeded to Chapri with object of intercepting  possible movement  of  raiders into  Khost.Militia exchanged  shots  with party of tribesmen.  Doubtful whether  ihese wereperpetrators of outrage, who  made good their escape in  dark.  Local tribesmen were responsible for picketing of  portion of line where attack took place, but were not in position.  General Officer Commanding, Northern  Command,  has conferred withChief Commissioner, North-West  Frontier Province, regarding  additional protectivemeasures, but does not consider situation calls for reinforcement of area.    Attack  on  Cavalry lines  of  Kohat occurred at 1 a.m. on night of 26th-27thNovember.   Haiders, who  numbered about 100, assembled in  Garwhal  close toEgerton  lines,  and  established   themselves  close  to  rifle  magazine.   Guard  onmagazines consisted of 1 non-commissioned officer  and six men.   Sentry was  shotdead,  and heavy fire opened  on remainder of guard, who were asleep in verandah ofbuilding which served as guardroom.  Guard  was compelled to  evacuate building,and was kept at distance while raiders  forced open magazine.   In (corrupt group)      ^pickets of other units in vicinity arrived on scene too late to intercept raiders.  Whole      ^of raid occupied only (? 15) minutes.   Court of Enquiry was held immediately,  andcertain unsatisfactory points  brought  to notice are being remedied.    2. As  regards  Military  Intelligence in  Kohat area, this is  working  in close touch  with local political intelligence,  and  is  adequate,  especially  as  we haverecently  approved scheme for combining Political, Military and  Civil intelligence organisation on North-West  Frontier  into one bureau, which should  add to efficiency.You will understand the difficulty of obtaining early news of raiders who from previousservice know our cantonments and methods, and whose raids are largely conducted onopportunist principles, which their  mobility  enables  them to make the  greatestuse of.    3. Our views on the frontier situation as a  whole are being given in a separateForeign Department telegram.
