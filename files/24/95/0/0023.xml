                                                              S8Dear-Sir Almeric,     Were I now in England, I would use every endeavour, everyargument, every scrap of influence I possess, to be able to plasebefore the authorities the state of affairs in Germany as I knowit to be.  But as I am not in England, all I can do is to send what i fear will bo a very poorly expressed account of the situation, intho hope that you, who know mo, may think it of sufficient import-ance to pass it to those, who, because of your mediation, will consider that there may be something in it.     The position Is changing for the worse, and my firm and considered opinion and conviction is that this country is beingridden to ruini  It may be difficult for me to justify that state-ment on paper, and I sometimes feel that It is hopeless to -tteto make anyone, who does not know these people, who has not livedwith them during the months since the revolution, who has not seentheir alternating hope and despondency, and, at last, their blinddespair, realize the danger of the utter collapse of which thecountry is on the verge*     The Government is at its wits&apos; ends,  Noske said to me lastnighti  &quot;We have the feeling that we are a drowning people, who,after 15 months in the depths, are just able to holdcn to the sides of the boat and keep our heads high enough to breathe - and then the Entente stamp with their feet on our hands and say to us.&quot;Keepyour dirty heads down; you belong to the depths, get back to them,f     I am writing principally to y ou to-day about a meeting I had with the Germans last nighta     I suppose it is because they can talk to me without an inter-preter, and, possibly, because my work here,, off and on since january,, has made me known to them,, that I have met them as I havedone.  They know I am no politician,, but they give me the credit of being straights
J.         I was asked&apos; if  I would  consent  to -wt-certain fenber^ of  the 1  Government last night,  and agreed, provided that  the  meetlng-iras .t**   be absolutely unofficial.  I explained that I  had no  authority  to   discuss  anything,  and that my job  was simply  that of  a Member of  theSI;                                                                 i   Commission of Control.         I wentc         We  mot  at  the house  of  Von Holtzendorff,  Ballings successor.        1   Noske, War Minister; Schaffer,  Minister  of Justice; General Von   Groner,  Ludendorff&apos;s successor after the latter is dismissal from   G.H.C.;  Schwaftsa,the Oberpresident of Kassel  (the illegitimate  son/   of  a  Strassbur,;  washerwoman  and one  of the soundest brains in   Germany); Warburg, the  Hamburg Banker-Financl r;  Dr,Melchior.,. who..   was  the  financial expert  at  the peace negotiations in Paris; Von   Holtzendorff,  the Heaa  of the Hamburg-America Line, and myself.   We  had a short  dinner,  and talked afterwards  till 1 a.m.  Thes-e men   representing the different political parties, were especially chosen^.                    - iv-   -              &apos; .                                                 I   that I might not feel  I was  beinfc influenced  more in one dir-e-ctdo-n   than in another..  It was  extraordinarily Impressive,  and,.,,Xmight   almost say,  tragic.   They were fighting  for their lives.- for-more   than, their lives - fighting for the existence of 70 Mllion^people.,   for whom they knew themselves to joe responsible.   It was a  fcri do   xvoeur4 that could not fail to impress -  to convince^  I was the straw   at  which they were cl utchingj with a terrible  last  de^pairlng^hope-.         I asked myself several  times if I Were not being fooled - if I   was really being  told what they thought^ or only what they wanted me   to  believe they thought,  and now, after many hours of cold deliberation,    I am writing what I have Ion,&quot; believed,  and what I am now firmly   ^convinced of.         The collapse of the present Government means the utter collapse   of  Germany.   The handing over of the Officers for trial means  the    collapse of the Government.   The Government will not lift one  finger   to  band over these Officers.  If they did, every Member of  the    Government would  hang by the neck from the trees in  the Tiergarten   within a few hours of the attempt - not that they would be                                                         particularly
particularly deterring W men who - for over a year^v have neverknown what it has been tr be free nf the danger of assassination,but - let me quote Ncake:  &quot;Europe always wanted a dumecratieGermany, and new - TR have to see the end of It - to have to facerevolution and riot, bloodshed and butchery ence again - and thenBolshevism - Oa  my God, where are we being driven to?  Where isthe way cut?   If we- refuse to hand these Officers ever, theEntente will act,, and the Government will have to gt;&quot;   The resultwill be exactly the same.,   For 13 months, almost night and day,with never one day&apos;s rest,. I have striven f^r this democraticGermany, and for the ab:1ishment cf militarism.   From the fistdays at Kiel, whither I was dispatched to restore order;  throughthat nightmare in Berlin inenl had t^ shoct hundreds    my count-rymen, until recently, when a certain amount of order was attained,when the will to work was gradually being revived in the people,all through those times I have worked for the policy of an l-mili-tarism, and now the noose is being tightened round our necks andWP. are almost strangled.   Tie have a secret Array&apos;   Tfle are onlytricksters!.   V!E. are playing the game!   God in heaven make these people  s^e us as we are!  ?e are^own - down, and almost out.Our cards are all on the table.   England has clever men;  whywon !t they believe us?  Or is it that - as so many be&apos;.leve - theirpolicy is absolute destruction?   For God!s sake, thini before you attempt the destruction of a nation of 70 million people.There are the psychologists of England?   Does not Englandrealise the pc?&apos;er she has jiurt now?   How, if she could but 3ay*HaltJ  Enough!   This shall not be dene!,1  she would be doing ftr herself almost as great a thing as she *vould be doing for germany.   Of course she sees a danger in Germany!   Look at&apos; thi3knife In my hand:  there is an edge on it that might cut my hand,but, because of that danger, am I going to sayj  &apos;This kni&amp;s mustcease to exist? - No!  I am going to use it to feed with, to work with it,, to produce with it,, and I shall control it so that itdoes net cut me again.  Treat us like that. Give us enough - just                                        sufficient - dock
indock material to carry on  our  commerce with.  Some is necessaryfor 7o million.  70 million  and no  outlet)  Leave mc the means efmaintaining order.   Don&apos;t  ask  us  for these Officers.  consider these points and we will live, -  live to recover and repaj you,  towork for you,  and,  some day, porhaps to work with you; for thepolicy of the future will  be that of continents, not countries.America-europe-Asia.  There  are times when I laugh - bitterly ifyou will - after receiving the Inter-Allied Missions.  The Frenchmake splendid long, flowery  speeches; the British lounge back withtheir hands in their pockets,  and,  at the end of the table is the little sphinx-like  jap,  rigid, apparently seeing, hearing nothing -in reality, getting everything out  of Germany under your nose.  the little men are all  over Germany.     We signed the  Peace Treaty,  knowing; we could never fulfil theterms,  and believing no nation would ever expect us to.  We can beno worse off by signing the  present terms than our refusal to signthem would make us, and we would  be acting more honestly by doing the latter.     Will you try to get the people in England to trust us, tobelieve us now ? We have  opened  our hearts to you, and talked reely - more so than we have  ever  done before.  We still have alittle strength - sufficient to struggle for an existence that maynot be a shameful one.  If &quot;we  catch hold once again, den*tstamp on us this time - this time we go-down for ever, and, then-The PESTILENCE.     God knows if you can.  help:   If you can, it will be by gettingyour people to believe the ,truth  about this Country,&quot;     I quote on only lloske.  Even in that collection of personali-ties he was the &quot;Man&quot;.     What is to be  done ?  Personally, I never looked on the trialquestion as other than impossible from the very beginning, and one has only to live here and  knew the  people, to realise the disaster                             4 -                                                     v/hich
which the attempt  will bring about.     I hope to be  in England next week.  Can you make it possi-ble for me to do  something - to see somebody ?  It is a hopelessfeeling knowing v/hat one  does about this, and realising thatall that canbrc done is  te write a letter which must come far short of carrying  the conviction which, a more eloquent penmight ensure.                          Yours etc.,                             (Sgd.)  W. STEWART RODDIE-                                                   Lt .-Col.
