General Staff.LONDON,  20th December, 1919.                        A. VISIT TO NORTH  GERMANY.     1. Views  of  M.  Haguenin,  French  Political  Representative  in  Berlin. M.  Haguenin  lunched  with General Malcolm on  5th December, and stayed for aconsiderable time afterwards, discussing the present situation  in Germany.  Amongstthe views expressed by him the following are of interest:      (i.) The Supreme Council in Paris is at present playing a dangerous  game in itsdealings with Germany.  It is essential to support the present German Government,on  the one  hand, against Monarchical reaction, on  the other, against the ExtremeIndependent Socialists.   The Government is attacked on all  sides  in Germany and its position is precarious.     He  has constantly reported  in this  sense  to the French  Government,  whoapparently take no  notice.    He  believes  in the establishment  of some  form ofMonarchical Government before long, but would not commit himself to any prophecyas to the  time ;  this would depend mainly on the action of the Entente.    (ii.)  A feeling of revenge  is growing  up in Germany, and  is being fostered in schools,  societies  and associations.   The  present policy of  the  Paris Conference isB20/43) 90 1/20 H&amp;S  7836wo
certain to unite all Germans by the feeling of overwhelming oppression which is beingcaused  to arise  in  Germany.   This policy cannot fail to promote the unity of allGermans and will prevent any separatist tendencies.     In his opinion France had had a great opportunity of separating Germany into atleast three States a Catholic South Germany, a Rhenish  State  to  include  the RuhrDistrict, and with Prussia as a separate State,  possibly without Hanover and Hamburg.Now the secession of Bavaria is very unlikely,  and Austria will probably join Germanysooner or  later.     (iii.)  Anything might have been done with Germany had  a more reasonable policy-been  adopted.   As  it is, hatred of France is  intense  throughout  Germany and  is unlikely to die out for many years.   Great  Britain is not so unpopular, except withcertain sections, especially the extreme Right.     There is a general feeling that Germany has been and is being treated with grossinjustice.   The claim to 400,000 tons of docks and harbour material was regarded as quiteunjustifiable.   The  repatriation of the German prisoners in France had been expected by Christmas, and the continued refusal of the French to return them is causing greatbitterness throughout Germany.     (iv.)  He does not fully understand the policy of the Supreme Council.    His own view is that the present Government, which  is pacific and anxious to carry out theterms of  the Peace  Treaty  as far as jDossible, should be supported, with  a view to strengthening its position and prestige.    He expressed the opinion that it is to GreatBritains interest to see Germany set up again  as a great industrial State, but that  thisis contrary to the wishes of the present rulers  of France.    The most  urgent needappears to be for raw material to set the German industries going.    There is a serious shortage  of coal in  many parts of Germany,  due more to lack  of rolling  stock andits bad condition than to  an  actual  want of coal.   Oil,  petrol and  rubber are allvery short.     (v.) He complains of the clumsiness of the persons at present entrusted with theconduct of German  diplomacy and the difficulty of finding suitable representatives forParis and also for foreign capitals.   They lack finesse, and the German aristocracy andupper classes are sadly wanting in tact and adroitness.     (vi.)  M. Haguenin  is  to  have a staff  of 25 Frenchmen under  him after the ratification  of  the  Treaty.   He is to be a  kind  of political attache&apos; to the french ambassador, but in no way secret.   He was for many years before the war a professorat the Berlin University, and is an extremely clever man, with  a considerable knowledgeof Germany and a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in Berlin.     2.  Views expressed  by Captain  von Arnim. (L). Captain  von   Arnim is an ex-officer  of the Great  General  Staff and a  clever man; he  was educated with theCrown Prince and Prince Eitel Friedrich.  He  is  said to be  wealthy  and, though a thorough  Junker, owns the printing press at which the  extremist newspaper Freiheit is printed.   He is pessimistic about Germany&apos;s future.  He says that Germany s industries are ruined and that  it is impossible to set them going.   The &quot; Valuta&quot; question seemsinsoluble, and  Germany  is  certain to  suffer  seriously from famine in view of herinability to buy food abroad at the present rates of exchange. He expects  conditionsin Germany to approximate in some parts to those  now  obtaining in Vienna, where heunderstands that cases of cannibalism are already occurring.     (ii.)  He is  really a  member of the Extreme Right party, but  refuses to go intopolitics at present, as he considers that the Conservative party is badly  managed andis working on the wrong lines.  In his opinion Monarchy is certain to return sooner or later, but in  quite  a different form to the old  regime.   The main difficulty is theabsence of a suitable candidate.  His view is that, if the Kaiser were available, he wouldbe the best candidate ; next  to him the Crown  Prince.   Other  Princes such as Albrechtof Wurttemberg, Rupprecht of Bavaria and  Max of Baden have  not  the necessarypersonality and  popularity.  At  present the  reactionary  parties  are  working  onunsound lines and without efficient leadership ; they want  change and reorganization.It would  be no use to call upon political generals  to lead these parties, and  at presenteven Hindenburg is  rather discredited.     (iii.)  He thinks the elections will be held  next spring and that  the  result will  bemore in favour of the Right parties, i.e., a coalition of Conservatives, National Liberals,Centre and Democrats, perhaps including a few  Moderate  Socialists ; but he does notthink that such a coalition would be permanent.     (iv.)  In von Arniins opinion the Supreme Council at Paris is responsible for most ofGermany&apos;s difficulties, and the demand for 400,000 tons of harbour material, &amp;c, was a
great blow.   If some favour or recognition had been shown to the present government it would have been much strengthened.     (v.) The Independent  Socialists have  gone over to the Extremists&apos; side, led byCrispian and Daumig, and are now advocating something like Bolshevism.  Both they and  the reactionary parties would gain many seats if the elections were held now.The  Government is weak and unpopular  and contains  no really strong man.   Ebert,Noske and Scheidemann are at present accused of corruption.  In general the  positionof the Government  is weak,  and they  have to  stand all the strain of Erzbergersunpopularity.     (vi.) We also discussed the question of the various forces  at present maintained byGermany.   Von Arnim considers that we ought not to abolish  the Einwohnerwehren,as otherwise  it would be impossible to  maintain order, but  as now constituted theycould not be of any danger.     (vii.)  In  general,  von  Arnim  rather  reminded me  of  the  German  officialcommuniques during the war ;  most of his statements were true and frankly expressed,but there were numerous exaggerations and, I think, several falsehoods.     3.  Views of General von Luttwitz and Herr Rechberg. (i.) Rechberg concentrated on two subjects, firstly, the danger  of Bolshevism  to  Europe and the world in general,secondly, the desirability of Great Britain and France  taking  over  a  share in a largeproportion of German industrial concerns, factories, &amp;c.     With regard to Bolshevism, Rechberg  emphasized its danger to the whole world,.and argued that it must be suppressed by force of arms.  He said that Germany could and, if permitted by the Entente, would furnish sufficient troops to destroy Bolshevismin Russia, these troops to be commanded by  a French  or British General, if considered desirable.     Rechberg, who, in addition to being one of the foremost sculptors in Europe, is  arich and successful commercial magnate, was insistent on the importance of the British,and also the French, taking over a share in the  management and  profits of most of theleading commercial undertakings in Germany.   His view is that such participation will lead to our taking an  interest in German trade and industry and that it will strengthenGermany&apos;s commercial position and therefore her power of meeting her liabilities to theEntente.     (ii.) General von  Luttwitz,  who was a corps commander in 1918, and is now in command of the troops in the Berlin area, was at first inclined to be bitter in his remarkson the methods of the Supreme Council, which he considers to be  quite unfair and of  a nature to deprive Germany of all chance of getting straight.     (iii.) Von Luttwitz said that great hatred was  felt  for France, but that public feeling in Berlin was not seriously adverse to the British.     (iv.) He admits that the German people are becoming  quieter, aud are graduallysettling  down, but  said that  it would be  impossible to guarantee  order and public safety if Germany&apos;s armed forces were  cut  down  to  the  strength fixed by the peace treaty.  He is anxious to retain the Einwohnerwehren, and emphasized their necessityin the interests of peace and  order, whilst urging their  non-military character  andpointing out the impossibility of regarding them as in any way a serious military force.As an instance he  quoted General von Kluck&apos;s  enrolment as a private in  the  localEinwohnerwehr, and  also  told a story about a  patrol of generals  which had beenformed on one occasion.     (v.) He alluded to the separatist tendencies in Southern Germany, and said that he considered the secession of Bavaria not impossible, though unlikely.     (vi.) As in the case of von Arnim,  it was difficult to  believe all von Luttwitz&apos;sstatements.  He was generally truthful, but occasionally seemed to  be talking  witha view  to effect.   His opinion of the present  Government is low, and he does notconsider them fitted to rule Germany.   He was anxious to know what we thought ofthe prospects of the British Labour party at our next General Election, and seemed to regard their possible victory as  a danger to the welfare of Europe.     4.  Views of Herr Noske and Major von Glisa. (i.)  Herr Noske is a  big man,,rather of the warrant  officer type, with a good appetite.   He  gave me the impression of being  energetic and strong-willed, but must be considerably inferior to his militaryentourage in education and military knowledge.  He was at first rather inclined to bedifficult and ill at ease, but gradually thawed  under the influence  of  wine, beer  andbrandy.(7836)-A 2
     (ii.) He complained bitterly of the attitude of the Supreme Council, which hadundermined the prestige and position  of the German Government  by its harsh andarbitrary  methods.   Their action was making the Government of Germany impossible,and driving the people to despair and a policy of revenge.     (iii.)  It  will be impracticable to reduce the Army too rapidly.   In his opinion, itwill be necessary to keep 200,000  men  for the whole of 1920; after that, he hopes 150,000-160,000 men will suffice.     (iv.)  He drew  attention  to  the  high  cost of the new Army,  in  view of theconditions of service prescribed by the Treaty.  He would like to be allowed to adoptthe terms of service fixed for the Austrian Army, i.e., a minimum of 6 years with theColours and 6 years  with the Reserve.   He compared the strength of the force allowedto Austria (30,000) with the maximum strength fixed for Germany (100,000), and saidthat, on the Austrian ratio, the German Army should have been nearly 300,000 strong ;apart from the ratio of troops to population, he pointed out that Germany is a far moreindustrial State than Austria, and consequently more liable to strikes and disturbances.     (v.) He stated that, in future, officers would be compelled to take part in all sportswith  their men.  It would no  longer  be possible for  officers to hold themselves alooffrom the men&apos;s games and recreation, as in the past.  &quot;     (vi.)  Major von Gilsa, Herr Noske&apos;s Military Secretary, promised to give GeneralMalcolm  the  most exact figures available of the strengths of the various military and semi-military formations  in  Germauy.   He did not know the  exact figures of theSicherheitspolizei, but thought  they were not above 40,000  strong in  all.     5.  Miscellaneous. (a.)  Visit to Mr. Brain, senior &quot;Times&quot;  correspondent. Ihad a long talk with Mr. Brain  on the afternoon of  7th December,  and found  his views almost identical with those of our Berlin  Mission, with whom he is in close touch.He has been messing with Colonel Pollock and other officers of the mission.     His views and reports are often  disregarded by the  Times staff in London, who are apparently apt to twist and distort his articles.   He  had never said  anything about a&quot;secret army&quot; in Germany, nor of any  danger of German aggressive action;  these statements have  been added by the Times authorities  in  London.  He bewailed thedelay in making peace, which he considers extremely detrimental to British interests.In his opinion it is of great importance to put an end to the system  of pin-pricks andNotes from Paris, and to get on with the peace  without further delay.    With prices as  they stand at present it is practically impossible for the Germanlower classes and officials to  exist, and  corruption is very  widespread.  Dishonesty  isrampant throughout  Berlin.   Shortage  of coal,  mainly owing to transport difficulties, is going to be serious.    (b.) Japanese intrigues  in Germany. All reports  tend to  show that Japaneseintrigues are important and on extensive lines.   Whether they will  flout  the entente powers  openly by engaging Germans as  military instructors is at least  doubtful, but itappears certain that they will  make use  of them  for  commercial purposes and willprobably  camouflage them in  this way for military work.  A  number of Japaneseagents are said to be active buying military and air material;  to what extent this hasbeen going on is uncertain, or whether  those agents have  been buying arms or ammu-nition, guns, aeroplanes, &amp;c.; it is possible, though unlikely, that they have only beenbuying  broken-up raw material.   On final ratification of the - Peace Treaty it should  be easy for our Commissions of Control to  establish the truth of these reports.     My own view is that the Japanese are preparing for a war with  the United Statesof  America, not because  they want the war, but because  they think it may become necessary for their position in  the Far East.   In  their opinion  the Germans were atleast as well equipped during the war, from a  military and scientific point of view,  asthe Allies, and for this reason they are anxious  to  gain every possible advantage fromthe present situation, both by engaging German experts and scientists to assist them,and by  acquiring as  much German war material as  possible without causing a ruptureof relations with the Allies.     (c.) Views of Independent Socialists, &amp;c. From various talks that I had withintelligent chauffeurs, mechanics, and other men of the same type, who said they wereIndependent Socialists,  I gathered  that this  party is genuinely anxious  to  avoid a renewal of military spirit in Germany.   They are of opinion that the German &quot;people are again becoming ready for war owing to exaggerated  terms hy the Supreme Counciland the cruel action  of the French in retaining the German prisoners of war.  Some ofthese men thought  that the military  party were  getting so  much  power into
388their hands that, by various pretexts, they would be able to push on their preparationssufficiently rapidly to make war on France in ten years&apos; time; the present attitude ofthe French was driving the people towards the military party.    They do  not  believe that the terms of the Peace Treaty will ever be carried out,and think it will end  in  smoke.  The  idea seems  to  be prevalent that Japan will be involved in war with the United States before long, and that Russia will become alliedwith Germany in the comparatively near future.    There is a universal belief in Germany that the Allies have over-reached themselves by forming  a Peace Treaty, many of the terms of which are impossible, and can never be executed.    (d.) Liaison with other Missions. The Berlin Mission is at  present out  of touchwith Warsaw, Prague and Vienna.  This is inevitable, as General Malcolm has not atpresent enough officers to send round, though he is anxious to do so.   While I was inBerlin, Major  Keenan arrived from Lithuania, and  General Malcolm  is now  in close touch  with  Kovno and with General Turner.  Later  on, when the Commissions ofControl are in working order and our troops of occupation are in Danzig, Upper Silesiaand other parts of East Prussia,  General Malcolm will  have a better opportunity for keeping in touch with the various Missions and with General Bingham,  General Haking,&amp;c.  It is certainly of considerable importance that our  Missions and Commands should keep in close touch, and  I  feel sure  that occasional visits by officers from the WarOffice are of value.    6.  General impressions. (a.)  The general opinion seems to be  that the  supreme council in Paris is now working in the  interests of the French,  who are anxious tokeep Germany down and to prevent her re-establishment.  This policy may suit france in view of her proximity to Germany, and declining population, but does not seem goodfor Great Britain, whose trade with Germany is of such importance.    It appears essential for the settlement of Europe that Germany  should be restored to a normal condition, and that her people should be got back to work.  Raw material and credit are urgently required, and must be supplied, if the condition of the  Germanpeople is to improve seriously.    (b.) There was no visible hatred  of England and  the British.   Both in  Cologneand Berlin British  officers walked about  without any sign of enmity being shown; girlsin Women&apos;s Auxiliary Army Corps  uniform and private soldiers in uniform  can goabout unmolested,  and our  chauffeurs drive their cars exactly as they would in london or Paris.  We are certainly respected, but I think most Germans hate us in their hearts.    (c.) The Berlin shops  are  full of excellent  things, though  at  high prices.  the streets are full of people who  do not  look unhappy  or  underfed, though their generalappearance is  apathetic  and unhealthy and they lack  colour.  Money seems  plentiful,but prices are extremely high, and the lower and middle classes find life very difficult.One day I paid 11 marks for two small teas at quite a moderate sort of tea place ; atthe present rate of exchange this is only about Is. 2d. in English money, but at pre-warrates would have been nearly 11s.  The shop people were quite friendly, aud there  wasno attempt in any of the shops I visited to charge me anything above  the normal price,which was nearly always marked on the article.    I saw few loafers in Berlin, and the people appeared to be busy in general.  Theywere not badly dressed, but did not look as fit  or as well fed as in Cologne or in SouthGermany.  The small amount of motor traffic was striking; traffic was  considerably less than in London or Paris, and there were few lorries to be seen ;  on the other hand,much use is made  of electric trains in Cologne,  Berlin,  Munich, and, in fact, in mostGerman towns.  Many theatres were  open  in Berlin and  in other  German towns and always seemed to be full.    (d.) The troops in Berlin do not look  up to the  old standard,  though some are quite smart; the officers were smarter than I had expected, and discipline is said to beimproving.   On several occasions, in  the early morning, parties of Reichswehr  troopspassed our house, each time under a  subaltern; these  detachments  were singing quitewell, just as in pre-war days.    (e.) On   the  night  of  the  6th-7th   December   the  British  Embassy in  theWilhelmstrasse  caught fire.   Several fire  engines  arrived on the  spot with greatpromptitude, and the fire was extinguished quickly and efficiently.
                         B. VISIT  TO SOUTH GERMANY.     1. On 11th December  I  left  Berlin  by a German  motor car with two Germanchauffeurs, and went to Munich via Leipzig,  Nurnberg, Regensburg, and  thence  toCologne via  Augsburg, Ulm,  Stuttgart and Frankfurt.   My visit was too short a oneto enable  me to do anything  more than form a general impression of what I saw, butI was helped  to some extent by my previous knowledge of the country and people, andby meeting former acquaintances.     2. In passing  through villages and  small towns the fit and healthy appearance of the people was very noticeable.  Outwardly I could see no difference as comparedwith  pre-war days, especially in the appearance of the children, who showed no signswhatever  of  under-feeding.   There is certainly more food in South Germany than inPrussia, and  prices are in general lower.  The  fields were well cultivated, and thecountry looked thoroughly  prosperous.   Factories all  seemed to  be working, and are said to have plenty of orders, but&apos; to lack raw material.     3. The upper  classes  certainly feel  their  position,  and dislike the  Prussians,whom they regard as mainly to blame for the German debacle, more than ever, whichis saying  a good  deal.  Prices  have gone up so much that life is very hard  indeed forState officials with more or less fixed incomes, and much dishonesty seems to  have beenthe result.     4. There is great bitterness  among the upper classes against the Entente Powers,and the British are not looked on with a friendly eye,  though there is a good deal lesshatred for us  than for France.   We are regarded as the  most important and powerfulnation, but just at  present as merely playing  second  fiddle to France  in  the  peacenegotiations.     5. I met very few motor cars during my long tour, and the difference in this-respect to the conditions in France and England is very marked.   The main  reason is-the shortage  of petrol and rubber ;  lubricating oil was also difficult to obtain.     Railway traffic is still very restricted, and  various lines, which were very active inpre-war  days,  are now  almost idle.   Shortage of coal is  the main reason, and Iunderstand the railway workshops  are working indifferently.     6. There seems to be  a  fairly  strong movement in South Germany,  especiallyBavaria, to separate from&apos; Prussia,  but I doubt if this will ever come to anything.  one party would  like  more  decentralization ;  another  is  in favour of Austria joiningBavaria, these two States to secede from Prussia, whilst  remaining within the GermanUnion of  States.   The  principal  motive  power is probably  the belief that Bavariawould get better terms from the Allies if separated from  Prussia.   As far as I couldascertain  during my short stay in Bavaria, the movement in favour of a definite rupturewith Prussia  is not yet sufficiently strong  to effect anything of importance.  Everybodybelieves that Austria will eventually join Bavaria, either  as a separate Roman CatholicState, or as part of the German Empire.   They ascribe this to the action of the Ententein rendering  Austria&apos;s position absolutely impossible, but admit that the Allies&apos; financialand economic help to Austria has done a great  deal for  that country in the last fewmonths.   They are of opinion  that Austria cannot stand alone, and in view of the  greatdifficulty  of forming a Danubian Confederation, will be forced to join Germany.     7.  I  visited  two  barracks  in  Bavaria and had some opportunity of seeing andspeaking  with  the soldiers of the Reichswehr Army.   The officers seemed very likethose of the old type, and are  working hard to  put things in order.  The discipline was good, though more like the old British  than the old German method.  Physique was generally good.     8.  Both  at  the Prinz  Arnulf  Barracks  at Munich and at  Augsburg (42ndRegiment), I was told that the local  Einwohnerwehr there  was being trained on therifle ranges in musketry.  Except  in the larger towns,  the country does not look ripe for disorder,  and there would seem no justification for the existence of these Einwohner-wehren.   I feel sure that in Bavaria, as in North Germany, the official class and  otherpatriotic people look upon these Einwohnerwehren as the foundation of a future NationalArmy, with  the Reichswehr and possibly the Sicherheitspolizei to furnish the cadres.     9.  In discussing  the  war with  former acquaintances in Bavaria I was very muchstruck by their ignorance of German guilt, both as  regards their  responsibility  forcausing  the  war  and their atrocities during  the war.   In general they believe  the German troops behaved quite well, and that practically  all  the  stories  of cruelty, &amp;c,were invented by  the lying  British Press.  I was  asked on one occasion &quot; Do youhonestly  believe  that  the general  hatred which  is  felt  throughout the  world  for germany is justly deserved by their actions during the war ? &quot;   Of. course I answered,yes! but my  reply  seemed to cause a good deal of surprise.   The British  blockade of
 Germany is looked npon as a greater crime than the German  submarine warfare, being directed against the whole German people, whilst German submarines only caused com-* paratively few casualties among  women and  children.  I  pointed  out that had  the German submarine warfare been as successful; as the  Germans hoped, it would have occasioned a good deal more misery and  starvation in  Great Britain than our blockade. caused in Germany.                            C. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.     1,  There is  no  present danger  of Germany attempting to assume an offensive. attitude, or even of making any military resistance against the Allies.     2.  The  German people are still thoroughly war-weary and do  riot want a fresh fight of any kind.  The shortage of war material,  i.e., munitions, transport, rolling stock, rubber, oil, &amp;c, is so great as to prevent any military action on a large scale.     3.  At the same time, national spirit is showing distinct signs of revival throughout Germany, and the people are recovering  in  body and  mind  from  the hardships and disappointments  of the war.   It looks as if the current of public  opinion  would  set towards the restoration of some form of monarchy within the next  few years, but  the country is not&apos;yet ripe for such a change.     4.  The  harsh line taken by the  Supreme Council during the last few months is driving many Germans towards the  Bight parties, who are beginning to foster a spirit .of patriotic enthusiasm and  revenge among the people.  Germany&apos;s main grievances at present are :      (a.) The Allied  demand  for  400,000 tons of harbour material,  &amp;c,  which is            regarded as totally unjustifiable.     (6.)  The continued retention  of the German prisoners of war by France.     (c.)  The employment of large  numbers of French coloured troops in occupied            territory.   (As I was in mufti I  was able  to see from personal experience            how  unpleasant  these natives are, and to  appreciate to  some extent the            feelings of the Germans in this respect.)     5.  There is still likelihood of unrest  and industrial  troubles,  but the people are becoming quieter and  more  sensible.   High prices constitute the main difficulty,  and. there will always be  a danger  of strikes and disturbances until a normal condition has been reached  in this  respect. The coming  winter  and early spring will be a critical period.     6. The  present  Government, or at all events its strongest members, are genuinely anxious to attempt to carry out the terms of  the Peace  Treaty, but their position  has been weakened  by the action of  the Supreme Council  in Paris.  It seems important to support and strengthen this Government by some  recognition of their comparative honesty and good  faith.  The alternative to  the present  Government, i.e,  the  rule of either the Reactionary or Extreme Socialist parties, would not be advantageous for  us.     7. Germany should be  strengthened, politically  and  economically, in order to- enable  the people to settle down a ad to make  it possible  for them to  pay us.   A loan is required to stabilize  the German exchange  and to  provide  raw material  to keep the factories going.   It would be  decidedly to the advantage of  Great Britain for Germany to settle down to a normal life.     8. German  military and  patriotic circles  are disappointed  at the failure of the Baltic scheme, but will not abandon their hope of acquiring  a predominant  position in Russia, and of eventually forming an alliance  with Russia.     9. There is  much evidence of Japanese activities in Germany, and they should be carefully watched.  Definite  proof and details  should  be  obtainable as soon  as  the Inter-Allied Military, Naval  and Air  Commissions  of Control get  to work,  on  the coming into force of  the Peace Treaty.     10.  There is  a strong feeling of hatred  for France, which is likely to develop  into lasting hostility  and  desire for revenge.  We  are not so  unpopular, except with  certain circles,  ie,  the   Prussian military party, who regard Great Britain as   Germany&apos;s princial enemy.      1.1.  The Einwohnerwehren constitute a serious  danger for the future, and should be  abolished with the least  possible  delay.    On the other hand, the strength of the German Army, as fixed by the Peace Treaty,  is too small;  a force of only 100,000 men
GENERAL STAFF,      WAR  OFFICE,          20th December, 1919.is  inadequate for the maintenance of order  in  an industrial country  of 60  millioninhabitants.   The Reichswehr should not  be reduced below  200,000 men during 1920,after   which  a  force  of  150,000   200,000  men  should be  sufficient, includingSicherheitspolizei (now believed to be about 40,000 strong).    In all other respects, the military terms of the Peace Treaty should be most rigidlyenforced.    12. The position of the British Military Mission in Berlin is strong,  and I considerthat its existence  is of  great advantage to British influence and prestige, apart fromother  considerations.  In my opinion the Mission should continue its functions for sometime after final ratification, keeping  in  close touch  with our  Charge d&apos; Affaires, theBritish sections of  the Inter-Allied  Commissions  of Control, our various commissions and representatives in Germany, i.e., at Danzig,  in Silesia and  East Prussia, and also-with our Military Missions in &quot;Vienna, Prague, Warsaw and the Baltic States.
