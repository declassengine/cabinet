Madda Khel  section of Tochi Waziris held jirga on 16th, at whichthey are reported to have decided against surrendering militia deserters&apos; rifles.    Part II. 2. After advance to Mandanna Kach, reported in.para. 7 of No. 133 of19th, operations were  undertaken on 19th by Derajat column  under Major-GeneralSkeen to clear hill west of Mandanna  Rash, which was held  in strength by IVIahsudand Wana Waziris.  Considerable opposition was encountered,  and owing to loss ofimportant point by two units which had suffered heavily in British  officers, operationsfailed, with  loss  of about  200 killed,  missing and wounded,  including 13  british officers killed or missing.   Attack was resumed next day and all objects gained.     3. No details of above incident yet received, but Chief  of  the General Staff,who is now touring frontier, conferred with Generals Climo and Skeen  on 21st, andtelegraphs that,  in spite  of good deal of opposition and slight set back on 19th,operations are proceeding well.   He considers, however,  that  inferiority of units ascompared with pi&apos;3-war standard is liable to produce repetition of experience of19th, and we are therefore on  his  recommendation  stiffening force by two  Gurkhabattalions.
