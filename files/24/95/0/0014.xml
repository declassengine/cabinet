In order;; to shorten it is suggested that^  portions in brackets should be omitte&amp;rjMy Lords and Members of  the  House.of Commons.     After many months of  friendly deliberation in Paris,the untiring     efforts of  the  Plenipotentiaries of theAllied and Associated Powers have  been crowned  with success, and Treaties of Peace with. Germany, austria and Bulgaria have been happily concluded.    In  thenegotiations for peace the Prime. Ministers  from all myDominions and also representatives of India took a leadingand an influential part.   I have  already  signified myapproval of the Treaty of  Peace  with Germany and have ratified it.   Peace still remains, to be concluded with the Ottoman Empire  end  the  republic of Hungary,  andI earnestly trust that the necessary negotiations forthis purpose will shortly  be brought to an equallysatisfactory conclusion.                               ,     I regret that there is  no -improvement  j,n  the unhappyconditions&apos; prevailing in Russia, end no immediate prospectof the establishment of  Constitutional Government in thatcountry, which alone can conduce td its union  and prosperity,anti to the lasting reconstruction  of Europe.    My relations with my Allies  and Associates  in the,Great &apos;7ar remain of the  most friendly and  intimatecharacter, and I have every  expectation that the close and intimate co-operation  which  enabled them to win the war will be long continued to  the benefit  of all nations.
     In August last my Government concluded with thePersian Government an Agreement tending to cement theties of friendship between the two countries and topromote the progress&quot;and prospority of Persia.   Ihove since hod the pleasure of entertaining the Shahon his first visit to Europe,     The signal success which has attended the visit of the Prinee of Wales to Canada and Newfoundland, andto the United States of America has filled my heart withfeelings of pride and satisfaction in which I am convincedthat all my subjects share.   The overwhelming enthusiasmwith which my son was welcomed throughout Canada and newfoundland affords a fresh proof of the affectionateloyalty which animates all my peoples, and! rejoice thathis visit has strengthened the ties of comradeship whichunite the various countries of the Empires  During hisstay in the United States also he was greeted with awarmth and kindliness which will, I am confident, havethe happiest effect on the relations between this countryand the Great republic.     A grievous loss has been suffered in the death ofGeneral Botha, in whom the Empire laments one of thegreatest and wisest of her leaders.     A measure which merles the first stage in thedevelopment of responsible Government in India hasbecome law, and I rely on all My Subjects to work together for its success.   In a Proclamation which Iera addressing to My Yicerpy and to the Princes and people of India, I am expressing My hope that harmoniouspolitical life will be steadily built up on the foundations thus laid, and I om announcing My intentionof sen-Ling My dear Son, the Prince of Wales, to Indiato inaugurate the new Constitution.
     Members  of  the  House  of Commons,  I thank you for the. provision that you have made  for the service of a year in  which public  expenditure  has necessarily con- tinued on  an  abnormal scale largely exceeding both the permanent  and temporary revenue.   I trust that next year with  the  return  to more normal conditions you will be  able  to  take  the first  steps in the reduction of the National Debt.   The condition of  our finances and the state of our  credit continue to occupy the serieus attention  of My Ministers.   Only by strict economy in  both public and private expenditure and &quot;by steady Increases  of  production can the country regain its historic position in  commerce and finance.     My Lords  and Members  of the House of Commons,jI cannot view without concern the grata economic position of a large part of Europe.   The task of restoring credit and  restarting industry in the countries whose economic life has been  destroyed by five years of war is one of the  first conditions  of a return  to settled peace, but it  is too large a task for any nation to undertake singlehanded.   I was enabled by your liberality to place a large sum at the disposal of the Supreme Economic Council for the relief of immediate necessities/ but that sum  is now nearly exhausted,   further measures of relief sn&amp; reconstruction can only be uijdertaxen as the result of  joint action by all nations interested in the restora- tion of international  trade.   My Government would gladlyco-operate with the Governments of Dther countries to this end if a suitable nlan can bo devised.I     Jn the sphere of domestic legislation the sessionhp.8 been marked bv the passage of an unprecedented
number of Bills dealing with reconstruction In all  its aspects.          During the past year important measures havebeen passed affecting the conditions of Labour. TheActs for restoring pre-war practice and for preventing the diminution of wages have done much to avoid frictionamongst the..masses of the employees 6f the country.The Industrial Court, which has been &amp;t up underanother Act, will I hope, be greatly resorted to as a peaceful means of settling disputes and creating har-mony In Industry.  The Bills which have been introduced for fixing a maximum number of hours of employment j.            upfor settling/a mimimum wagej and for making increased provision against unemployment remain to be dealt withnext Session.  When these great questions have been settled, It may be hoped that a considerable advancewill have been achieved In the betterment of the life of the nation.          The Electricity (Supply) Act should prove to bea beneficient measure of helping to conserve the nationfssupplies of coal and improving the atmospheric conditions and thereby the health of industrial communities,  aswell as effectively developing a more efficient supplyof power for transport, industrial, and domestic purposes.         The continued high cost of living has given cause for your anxious consideration and measures have beentaken which it is hoped may prevent the charging ofunreasonable prices for necessary articles of consumption.         j*The Patents and Designs Act, besides providingrelief for patentees who have suffered loss by reason ofthe war, will confer permanent benefit In the preventionof the abuse of pateat monopoly and in the encouragement of invention.
     By the Trade Marks Act further facilities in the registration of Trade Marks have been given to the commercial 60community and certain defects in the law have been remedied^     I view with satisfaction the Act which has been passed to Improve and develop the Transport Services of the country which are so essential to the prosperity of Trade.     I have had great satisfaction in assenting to a Billfor the  establishment of a Ministry of Health which is now in process of organisation.  I anticipate that this new Department,when in full working order, will prove invaluable as an effective and co-ordinating power In the service of the health of thecommunity,     I have also given ray assent to an Act constituting aMinistry of Agriculture, Agricultural Councils for England andWales, an Advisory  Committee  to assist the Minister, and providingfor the  decentralisation of Agricultural Administration throughCommittees of  the County Councils,     My  people have reason to be satisfied with  the progress  made during the past  year  in the gigantic task of  demobilising my  Navy,Amy and Air Force, impeded as  it has been by the uncertaintiesof the international  situation, and by the unrest prevalent  through-out the  world.     The lot of  the men who have served  in my forces during  thewar, and especially of those  who are disabled, has given me  greatconcern.   I am glad to know  that very great  numbers  of  them  havebeen re-absorbed in peaceful  industries, but  I am anxious that employment should be  afforded to all who really  desire  it.    Tothis end I have  made  an appeal  to  the employers  of  the  country which has  received  a large response; but more remains to be  done,and  I  am hopeful that the  measures  which have been  and  are being  taken for giving them  training  in  skilled occupations  and  for placing themin employment  will  have the  support  of  all my people and  yieldthe results which all must desire.   At  the  same  time  the scales of disability  pension have,  I am pleased to  say, been satisfactorilyincreased to meet the present high cost  of  living.
g, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.December 16th, 1919.     Measures have also been passed to facilitate the settlement on tho land of ex-Servico men who have fought in the War andfor providing them with! the necessary financial and other assistanceto establish them in Agriculture..
