PV 3 9.                 &apos;  THE  GROWTH OF EXPENDITURE&apos; ON EDUCATION.           . Membrariduin  &quot;by  the President of the Board of Education.        -  1.  The Board of Education have provisionally estimatedthat they will require a vote of  43,570,000 in the year 1920-21.This compares with a vote of  32*770)000 in the current year, andof ^619j335*000 in the year 1918-19, &quot;being an increase of 24,23?1000 in the two years.         &apos; 2*  The causes of this increase are           i.   The devaluation of money.  The-salaries of.teachers,              which form the principal item in the expenditure on            &apos;  education, have had to he readjusted to the falling              value of money, and-the cost of nearly all other              expenditure, on the upkeep of schools has had to he              similarly increased.          ii.   The levelling up of teachers&apos; salaries in those              areas where formerly they fell below a reasonable              minimum.        - Hi.   The return from war conditions to peace conditions.              The training, colleges once more are full, the element              ary schools.are better attended, technical and evening              work is resumed, and :the normal increase,arrested  durir              the war, is re-establishing itself throughout the              edupational system and becomes, an abnormal increase by              reason of the arrears waiting to be overtaken.          iv.   Some reforms and extensions in the system of              education.           v.   Special assistance to Ex-service men.          3*  The salaries of teachers are not determined by theBoard of Education, nor paid by the Board;  but they are determinedand paid by&apos; tHe teachers&apos; employers, that is to say principally  byLo*al Education Authorities.          The Board pay grants to the Local Education Authorities atthe rate of 60 per cent, of their expenditure on Elementary teachers&apos;salaries, and, as this expenditure is hot ascertained until after the close  of the year, the Board pay during the year instalments&apos; of  grantbased  on &quot;the expenditure of the previous year.  Grants are similarlypaid on other expenditure on the Elementary schools, but at  different rates  viz., 20 per cent, and $0 per cent;  and in highly rated areas(about  60  in number) the Board also bear a proportion of the         texpenditure when the rate rises beyond a certain point.
     4.   Distribution of the increase &quot;between elementary and higher  education.          The  net  increase in the Estimates during the two years  is distributed  thus  over the main objects of expenditure (figures  inthousands of pounds)-i...........................      m.....w&apos;*v*u&quot;W.y:.......i&apos;...,.n&apos;i .&apos;.KiMii.iii&apos;i......................&apos;.............&apos;................................

Subject to this  temark, we may thus apportion the increase of 24-23!;,OOO which  has taken place in  the Board&apos;s Vote during thelast two years to  the several  causes  named&apos; in paragraph 2 above     Causes (i) and (ii),&apos;          revaluation of ronoy,  as  affecting cost of          upkeep cf Schools apart from teachers&apos;&apos;salaries,                                         4,325&apos;; OOO          Devaluation of  money as affecting teaohers1          salaries,and levelling up of salaries.                                        15,000,000        19,32^,000     Cause (iii)          Heturn to peace conditions  and normal increases   1,590,000     Cause (iv)          Educational reforms                              1,320,000     Cause (v)          Special  Assistance  to Ex-Service men           * 2,000,000                                                          24,235,000
     5*   Reverting now to the causes stated in paragraph, 3-alvyYe^for the  increase in tne-Boards estimates, we may take them one&quot;by one.     The devaluation of money is the great cause, and affectsnearly all expenditure on Education and consequently affects theBoardTs Grants which are mainly based on the expenditure of theli.E, As *     Apart from salaries of teachers, the items affected therebyare the wages of caretakers and cleaners, fuel, light, cleaning,books and apparatus^ furniture, repairs to buildings, rates, costof loeal administration, etc.   We wstimate that if all these items-(apart from teachers salaries) had remained stationary at the levelof two years ago,.   the Board1 s Estimates for 1920-21 would belower by  4,325,000 than they must now be.     In assigning a figure ( 15,000,000) to the increase in the                                                       arlcriesBoardTs grants as resulting from the increase in teachers/,, itis not possible to distinguish between the increased expenditureresulting from the devaluation of money, and that, resulting fromthe levelling up of salaries which in many areas were, and insome areas still are, very low,         *     The average salary of teachers taken as a whole inElementary schools in 1913-14, was  99-  4:  in the presentyear, according to the most recent estimates, it is  184.   Thisis an increase of c6%*   It may be mentioned that the minimumcommenting salary of a policeman is now  132.     The teachers employed in the higher schools are tooheterogeneous a body to admit of theii salaries being con-veniently stated in terms of averages:   the latest estimatesshow that the L.E.As. (who are not tho only employers of suchteachers) are spending  3,185,000 on salaries of teachers in secondary schools and other places of higher education in thecurrent year, as compared with  1,768,000 in 1.913-14,. or anincrease of 80 per cent.

In paragraph 3.above and. estimated to amc  t altogether to  1,590,000 out of thetotal increase that has taktm place in the two years, arises throughoutthe subheads of the Board&apos;s Vote.  The principal items of it are
        B.   The  expenditure  of  2,000,000 per annum on the Ex-Serf Ice  men  Is  special and  temporaryj It Is incurred for the purpose of  paying  the  fees  of demobilised officers and men at , places  of higher education  (Universities and Professional Colleges) and for  contributing  to the cost of their maintenance. It was  undertaken  inaccordance  with a decision of the War Cabinet and  is  being attended  with  satisfactory results.        9.   Continuance of the Increase.            The  main causes  for  increase in the Board&apos;s vote have not yet spent their force, but are continuing to operate. The  salaries of teachers are still being adjusted to the devalua-&quot;tion of money,  and are still being levelled up towards a national standard.   An Important step towards asuablishing an adjustment of elementary school teachers1  salaries to a national standard has  been taken  by  a joint committee of teachers and their employers under the chairmanship pf Lord Burnham.  If the scale proposed by that Committee  is adopted by both parties, it will begin to operate from  1st January, 1920J the Increased expenditure consequent  thereon will be  undertaken by the Local Education Authorities as  from 1st April,  1920; and the principal part of the  Board *s share  of that Increase will become payable by the Board in 1921-22 by way of  increased grants to Local Education Authorities.            But  the salaries of  teachers in secondary and other higher  schools  have lagged  behind.  They have still to be read- justed  to the devaluation of money, and they have still to be levelled up.      10.   The  educational  reforms and extensions which are responsible for an Increase of   1,320,000 In the Board.ls Estimates for 1920-21  (see  paragraph 7 above) have not yet reached their full running  cost.
     Pans Ions for toachers wcrf  estimated by me when the TeachersSuperannuation Act 1918 was Introduced to cost upon the existingnumbers of teachers and upon the salaries then provd ling. &amp;2,000,000in ten years.  The investigations since made into the subject by theGovernment actuary have confirmed that estimate, and I see no reasonto depart from iU  The increase in salaries will of course involvea corresponding increase in pensions.                                                                  s ^      Grants for maintenance-allowances are limited to a total of 3/-per head upon the children in average attendance in Public elementary schools, of whom there are at present about 5j millionso  The grantswill gradually expand from their present figure of  250;000 to about 800,^00      extension of Medical inspection and treatment to secondary schools and other places of higher education is estimated to rise from its present figure of  40,000 to about  250,000 in four years&apos;time.      Scholarships tenable at Universities, now set down for  20,000would reach in three years time a maximum of  100,000^      Nursery Schools (which now figure for  5,000) if th^y are widelyspread were estimated in 1918 to be likely to cost ultimately  900,000;since that estimate was formed, a general rise in prices has occurred to  increase such an estimate, but on the other hand the present difficulties in the way-of establishing new schools will operate to postpone the completion of the programme. &quot;s      Grants to Juvenile Organisations CommitteesT(at present  5,000)belong to a class of expenditure encouraged by Sect,17 of theEducation Act, 1918, the general object of which  is to supplement andreinforce the i nstruction and social and physical  training givenin the  schools.  V/e have not at present fixed  any maximum limit tothe cost of  such developments, nor have we the data for making a fore-&quot;ast of them.
11.  Other aducatisnal reforms and extensions,  as  a resultaf the Education .AQt 1918,  have still to  &quot;be taken  in hand.  when that measure was before the i:louse of Commons, I  gave an estimateef the probable cost of three of its important measures, viz:-    1. Abolishing half-timers,  and retaining       all children in public elementary       shhools till age 14                    1,000,000 per annum    2.. Continuation Schools                  8,750,000  11    &quot;    3. Nursery schools                          900,000  &quot;     &quot;                                             10,650,000As to the first of these,  the reform has  not yet come intooperation, and no provision is made for it  in 1920-21.  As tothe second,  the compulsory  attendance at  continuation schools for young persons aged between 16 and 18  is deferred by.theAct itself for seven years,  and their attendance &quot;between ages14 and 16 has not yet taken effect,  nor has any  date been fixed for its commencement.  The  rise in salaries and  the fall in thevalue of money that have taken place since  the  estimate ef 8,000,000 was made have been considerable,  and  the estimate will need revision accordingly,  but such revision cannot profitablybe attempted until we know  the period of  time to which it shouldrelate,  and the major conditions as to the  value of money and thecest of building during that period.     As to the third measure,  nursery schools, a beginning isnow being made with these,  and as mentioned in paragraph 7a sum of  5,000 will be taken in the Estimates for 1920-21 under that Heading.  That sum will relate to nursery  schools con-ducted by voluntary bodies;  is so far as  they are  to be main-tained by Local Education Authorities,  the  provision for them is contained in the general grant ip aid of  the expenditure ofthese Authorities and cannot be separately  stated.
                             -8  -                    .  .-14612.   These are the direct and  specific  oharges  to be laid on theExchequer by educational reforms  enjoined  directly and specificallyby the Act, but they bear Very  little relation to the: additional burden which the taxpayer- will  be&apos; asked  eventually to bear*     The Act places upon the Local Education Authorities the-dutyof completing (after due inquiry  and consultation) their provisionof education of all grades;  and it places  upon the Board ofEducation the duty of making Substantive Grants  by Regulations in aid of education.  The cost of  the measures arising therefrom will depend partly upon the minimum  provision which all Local EducationAuthorities find it necessary to  make, and partly upon the extentto which they proceed beyond that minimum  in developing theirschools.  There are 319 Local Education  Authorities for elementary education,  and 145 for Higher Education, and they are now, in con-sequence of the passing of the  Act,  engaged actively in consideringand framing their schemes.  Obviously no Minister can now anticipateall the provisions of their schemes,  or  the sum  total of their cost.The development of public expenditure from rates and grants taken together has within  living memory been  strikingly large.  In theyear 1891-2 it stood at less than  8,000,000, and in 10 years fromthat time it was doubled so that  it stood  in 1902 at a little over 16,000,000.  It had more than  doubled again by  the year 1917-1918, so that it then stood at  nearly  35,000,000.  It is now in afair way to double itself once  more,  but this last reduplication isprincipally a mere readjustment of figures to the present value of currency.  The future expansion of the cost will depend partly uponthe trend of prices; partly upon  the energy  of lecal EducationAuthorities, and on the liberality ef successive parliaments;ultimately it will depend on the degree  of determination  shawn bythe people cf this country to establish  the  best national  system efpublic education that they can afford.13*   The following figures will  serve to  compare  the pre-war expenditure&quot; af public funds (from rates  and  grants)  on  education,with the expenditure of the present periods

15.   The Cabinet might perhaps apprehend from the foregoingobservations that the Government is committed to indefiniteexpenditure upon the development of education.   But it has tobe remembered first that the developments for which the Educa-tion Act of 1918 prepares the way will take place gradually. Upto the present time no scheme prepared, by an Education authority under that Act has received the approval of the Board of Educa-tionj  and when schemes are approved, the present exceptional ,difficulties in building and raising loans will hinder theirrapid progress.   Next, it Should be remembered that theexpenditure by Parliament is attendant upon, and thereforelimited by, the expenditure from the rates.   The existinggrant system is such that while, by the Education Act of 1918,the State guarantees, to bear one-half the total cost, leaving the other half to be borne by the rates, in practice the grants are fixed on a more liberal, but not too liberal basis.   Theproper tions borne respectively by the grants and rates in1918-19 were 46 f: 54$, in the current year they will probablybe 53.  47/:.   The proportion borne by grants is, therefore,not.so great as to encourage extravagance in the Local Educa-   ,,  (See Note  :*t end) .tion Authorities/;  and it is reasonable that the Governmentshould be a little liberal in its encouragement of educationalexpenditure, for that is a form of expenditure ifoich serveslofty ends rather than the purpose of immediate gain, and so                                           afar as it is profitable, is profitable from-^ ^en^erous and far-sighted ,conception of public good.   Thirdly, it will be observed that the chief source of the present increasein expenditure is salaries.   There is no reasonat present to say  that the salaries paid to the
teache**s are extravagant    very much the contrary.   There is,however, no public object to be served by an indefinite expsa-sion of expenditure on salaries j and. if it appears that theforces making for economy are not sufficiently strong toenable Local Authorities to resist pressure from the teachersfor extravagant salaries, it is open to the Government to reinforce them by declining to pay grants in aid of extravagantsalary expenditure.  Under the English system of p ubliceducation the responsibility for local educational administra-tion and expenditure rests in the first instance with theLocal Education Authorities, and they are very jealous of their rights, but  circumstances may force oh the State measuresrestricting  the liberty  of Local Education Authorities by placing limits on  the expenditure or scale of expenditurein  aid  of which grants will be  made.  The Board  are watching the ^atter and are  instituting  a close enquiry,  with the help of the  Government Actuary1 s Department  Into the proba.bletotal effect of the  provisional minimum  scale recommended byLord Burnhamfs Committeej and the existing scales where theyexceed  it.      16.    I have the more gladly  taken this opportunity  of placing information before  the  Cabinet about the trend  ofexpenditure  on education, because I have, been disappointed  on three several occasions  of  the  opportunity  of  entering  at length  into  the  subject   in the House  of  Commons.   Since  Ispoke on the Estimate of the year 1917 to 1918,  no  such oppor-tunity  has  presented itself, When the  Education  Act, 1918,was before  the House, and the  Financial  Resolution  was  taken theMinisters  In charge of  the  Bill were ready to enter Into  thematter  but  they  were not called upon  and the Resolution waspassed  without any remarks.
                                 i                                 \When tho Estimates for 1918-19 were taken the time was so muchcurtailed that there was no opportunity for any explanations to begiven, except In regard .to the Supplementary Estimate for the grants to Ex-service Officers and. Men.  I had hoped to enter fully into the matter upon the Estimates of the current year, but theywere passed undor the guillotine without any discussion at all.                           mm       Tt must be remembered  th;;t under the existing  system  of grants,  increased, expenditure  incurred by a local EducationAuthority in one year does not result in an increase of Govern-in on t  grants until the next year,   Therefore,  in tho year inwhich  the increased  expenditure is incurred tho increase isborne by the rates.   This gap in time botweon expenditure  and grants  is a check op on rapid  expansion of expenditure.   localEducation Anchorites aro alvays urging that tho gap  should  beclooed up, but its preservation is undoubtedly an incentive to economy and tends to retard tho growth of expenditure.      Specfil grants aro at present made to necessitous areas to the extent of half their expenditure in excess of the produce of a rate of 27&quot;.   Por various reasons it appears inevitable that the standwrfl. rate for tho purposes ef this gr nt should beraise&apos;1 from 27d. to 4Sd.   The effect cf this would bo veryconsiderable in pr --renting necessitous arpas from embarkingcn increased expenditure.                                   (Intlld.)
