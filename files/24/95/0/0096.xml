At  the  Prims Minister^s Conference held en the 10th        November,  1919,  it  was  decided the t * ail&quot;communications  whether        to  or from the  League of Nations  should be sent,  for purposes        of  distribution among Government  Departments,  to  a Central        Office attached to  the  Secretariat of the Cabinet.        2*    No  reference was made to the  question of communication        between  the  League  of Nations and the Self-Governing Dominions:        and the  Dominion Governments have not been informed that there        is  to be a branoh of the Cabinet  Secretariat which will act as        a clearing house.        3.    I have  now received from the Acting Secretary-General        of  the League of Nations a communication to the Prime Ministers        of  Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa with a request        that  it  may  be  transmitted by me  to the Dominions concerned.        4B    AS  the  question bf oommunicati -*xu  between the League        and the  Governments of  the Dominions  is a constitutional one of        no  little  importance, I should be glad  of instructions  as to        whether  j*            (a)   The  Ccmmunioation is  to be forwarded  without                 comment  :                                 or            (b)   3?he  Dominion Governments  informed 1 f  the  decision                 &apos;5th form a branch of the Cabinet Secretariat to  act                 as a olearing house  and requested to  forward their                 replies  to  the  League through this channel.        5.    I raise the question as if the communication,  referred        to  is forwarded without oomment there i8 nothing  to suggest that        the Dominion Governments should do otherwise  than reply direct        t:;  the Secretary-General of the League: and it would appear        desirable  that  whatever procedure is  to be adhered        to  in the  future should be adopted in the first instanoe./                             (Signed) M.P.A.HANOI.  2, Whitehall Gardens,  3.W.1,gj g C RE 1..fl;.P;.-S93.6th January,. 1920.
