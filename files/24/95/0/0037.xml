[This Document is the  Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1919.1.CONFIDENTIAL    THIS is the memorandum (on the lines of that upon the Baltic States) which, theCabinet asked me a little while ago to have  prepared  in the  Foreign. Office on thesubject of the trans caucasian. Republics and situation.                                                                    C. OF  K.    December 24, 1919.TRANSCAUCASIA.59    The component parts  of  Transcaucasia were incorporated in the Russian Empireat various dates.  The whole of this country only finally came under  Russian  rule in 1878, when, under the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, Turkey ceded the provinces ofBatoum, Olti and Ardahan  to Russia.    The people inhabiting  this  country  are  Moslems  (both  Shiahs and  Sunnis),Christians (Orthodox  Greek and Russian, Armenians^ Lutherans), and Jews.  Thereare supposed to be eighteen distinct races and forty-eight different dialects.    The area  is  at present divided  into four districts : Georgia, the ArmenianRepublic of Erivan, the Azerbaijan Republic  and the Batoum province.  In the noteswhich follow, however, it has been necessary to  take account also of the province ofDaghestan which, though lying to the north of the main Caucasus range, was  includedin the old Russian administrative area,  and is a  prominent factor  in the presentsituation.    The population  of  Transcaucasia  was  estimated in 1915 at  about 7,000,000,.composed of                  1,650,000 Georgians.                 1,200,000 Armenians.                 2,000,000 Moslems (Tartars and tribesmen).                   700,000 Daghestan hill tribes.                   325,000 Russians.                 1,200,000 European colonists,  foreigners, Jews, &amp;c.    The natural resources  of Transcaucasia  have, under Russian influence, remainedpractically undeveloped, with the exception of the oilfields round Baku, the manganesedeposits in Georgia and the large copper deposits in the Batoum province.   Lack of communications and the restrictions placed by the former Russian Government onforeign  capital probably account for this state of affairs.  In and  around the mainCaucasus  range are to be found copper, oil, lead,  iron, coal and other minerals,together with immense wealth of timber.  An important fishing industry flourishes onthe shores of  the Caspian, where also are to  be found large supplies of Glauber salts.In the development  of waterpower  also the country is rich in potentialities, as yetpractically unexploited.               Position  before the Russian Revolution of 1917.    Previous to the revolution Transcaucasia was administered as  an integral part ofthe Russian Empire under a Viceroy whose seat was at Tiflis.   The country was divided into six Government departments, i.e.,  Black Sea  provinces,  Kutais, Tiflis,Baku, Erivan, Elizavetpol, and the then provinces of Batoum, Kars and Daghestan.                       Development since the Revolution.    In 1917, when the Russian Army left the Caucasian front with the cry of &quot; peace without annexation and indemnities ! &quot; and thus exposed the whole country to the attackcf the Turks, a trans caucasian Diet was formed  at Tiflis in the shape of a coalition ofGeorgians, Tartars,  and  Armenians, with a view to the creation  of  a FederatedCaucasus, and to the defence of the frontiers  against Turkish invasion.   This attempt at combination proved abortive.  The Tartars of Azerbaijan were in  open sympathy
-with the Turks, while the Armenians considered that the Georgians were attempting toestablish a central Georgian Administration to govern the Caucasus from Tiflis.     Subsequently at various  dates  and under different auspices  the  three districtsknown as Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Armenia established their own Governments and declared themselves independent republics.  Although these republics are not formallyrecognised by His Majesty&apos;s Government, a  certain de facto recognition is  impliedin  the  despatch  to  Tiflis last summer  of  Mr.  Oliver  Wardrop as  chief BritishCommissioner in  Transcaucasia.    The  measure  of  local  recognition  necessarilyaccorded by our military representatives  during  the period  of British occupation is referred to below.                 Short  Historical  Sketch of the several Areas.(a.) Batoum Province.     The Batoum province would seem  to have belonged to the old Kingdom  ofGeorgia as early as the 7th century.   In the 15th century the Georgians lost it  to theTurks, who eventually ceded it to the Russians in 1878.     The province was again ceded to Turkey  in  1917  by  the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.The Georgian N ational Assembly, not .recognising this treaty,  declared war on Turkey,but were unable to prevent her from overrunning the  province, which  remained in turkish hands until the British  occupied it in accordance  with  Clause 15 of theTurkish Armistice Terms, an occupation which is still in force.(b.) Georgia.     The origin  of the ancient Kingdom  of Georgia belongs to the pre-Christian era.In the Middle Ages to go no further back-she played a prominent part in the laterCrusades.  Her  history  for several  centuries  thereafter is a long and chequered storyof struggle with Turks and Persians.  On the expansion of  Russia towards the  south,Georgia offered  to unite with her northern neighbour  to free  the  Caucasus  fromTurkish rule.  In 1783 she concluded a treaty with Catherine II  of Russia pledgingber support to Russia in  return for her complete  internal independence.  However, in1801  Russia  annexed   Georgia,  promising to   maintain  her previous  rights and privileges in their entirety.  This  promise Russia never fulfilled, and  the Georgiansmade the  grievances  arising  from this  breach  of faith  the subject of  a fruitlesspetition addressed to The Hague Conference in 1907.                              -     The trans caucasian Diet, formed after the  Russian Revolution,  continued  achequered existence until June 1918.  During this period, the British Military Missionat Tiflis, under the late Lieutenant-Colonel Pike,  endeavoured to give  it all the moral support possible, and financed it with a loan of  4,000,000 roubles in the hope that under the predominating influence of the Georgian statesmen, Jordani and Gegechkori,both members of the former Russian Duma, the  Diet would be maintained and  would continue the war on the side of the Allies.     Owing to the conflicting interests of  the various races and to Bolshevism in theGeorgian  army,  this  policy  failed.   The  establishment of a separate GeorgianParliament and  a declaration of Georgian independence was the eventual outcome.The trend of Georgian domestic policy since that date is dealt with below in its relationto Bolshevism.   It will suffice  to note here that recent reports testify to  the remarkablegrowth  of  local  government  in Georgia.  The  Zemstva, established  under the oldRussian Government, have come to play a far  more prominent part in  the  life of thecountry than was ever the case under the old regime.   They have wide  local powersand are shortly to send their own&apos;  elected  representative  to the Central Parliament atTiflis.    According to Russian statistics (which  include the  province of Batoum) thecountry has an area of 13,456 square miles and a population of 2,512,000, including          1,530,000 Georgians (Christian and Moslem).              .           260,000. Armenians.           129,000 Russians.           213,000 Turki-speaking Moslems.           126,000 Moslem tribesmen.(c.) The Armenian Republic of Erivan.    The Armenian provinces  of Erivan  and Nachichevan were  ceded to Russia byPersia in accordance with the  Treaty  of Turkmanchai in 1828, while the rest of-Caucasian Armenia came definitely under  Russian rule in 1878, when the provinces ofJ ars  Olti and Ardahan were ceded to Russia by Turkey under the Treaty of Berlin. V
ID     The future of the Caucasian Armenians must inevitably be bound up with that ofthe Turkish Armenians, hundreds of thousands of whom aro at present refugees inTranscaucasia.  The  Caucasian Armenians, while  not so  cultured as the Georgians,.are thrifty and industrious.  But the politics of the Erivan Republic are dominated bythe notorious Armenian secret society known  as &quot; Dashnaktsutiun,&quot;  which,  with its programme of revenge and agitation, has recently manifested anti-British tendencies.     This Society is violently socialistic and  revolutionary in origin,  but its present policy in the Caucasus is centred on :      1.  The acquisition of territory for the Erivan Republic.     2.  The extension and equipment of the Armenian armed forces, and     3.  The propagation of the doctrine of the Dashnaks.     It seems improbable that  sound democratic Government will be  attained in theErivan Republic until the activities of this Society have been ended.   The Society by its methods of terrorism prevents the better and broader-minded elements of ArmenianSociety from taking up official positions.  M. Khatissian, the Prime Minister, thoughhimself at one time a  Dashnak, has been often in conflict with the advanced membersof the Society, while M. Papandjanian, a former member of the Russian Duma,,and a.representative of Armenia at the Peace Conference,  is recently reported to. have retiredowing to differences of opinion with the Society.     According to Russian statistics, the  population  of the  districts  composing thepresent Republic of Erivan was estimated  in  1912  at 1,081,000, of whom just under600,000 were Armenians, and the rest Moslems.  In addition, there were, some 700,000Armenians scattered up and down the  rest of  Transcaucasia, there being 230,000 inGeorgia, 180,000 in Azerbaijan, and between  200,000 and 300,000 in the province ofBatoum and the areas disputed between the respective Republics (see map).     In addition to the native population, it is estimated that  there are in the ErivanRepublic at present about 300,000 refugees from Turkish Armenia,  and some 30,000Assyrians.     Throughout Transcaucasia there is no more pressing problem than that of relief.But  at  the present time the Armenian Republic is economically in a  probably worsestate  than  any country in the  world.  The town and villages are full of refugees, thecountry has been devastated by the Turks.   Food is hard to get, and  in spite of theefforts of  the American Relief Commission,  there  is much  sickness  and  starvation,while, until at least quite recently, there has been continual fighting between Armenianand Moslem in the districts disputed with Azerbaijan.(d.) The Azerbaijan  Republic.     This  province  was ceded to Russia  by  Persia under the  Treaty of Gulistan in1813.  Unlike Georgia it has had no previous history as an independent State.     Before the advent of Russia the country was alternately under Georgian,  Turkishand Persian rule.  The inhabitants are a Persian type of  Shiah  Moslem, and theirlanguage is a Turkish dialect.     The territorial area of the present  Republic is about 32,500 square miles,  witha population of about  2,000,000, of whom 60 per cent, are Mahommedans, 20 per cent-Armenians,  6 per cent.  Russians, the  remainder being Persians, Jews, &amp;c. (Russianstatistics).     The Apsheron Peninsula,  on which the town of Baku is situated, is, in  the  eyes of the Russians at least, probably the most important district  in  all Transcaucasia.Large oil deposits in this district produced in  normal times the greater part  of the oil fuel consumed in  Russia.   The port of Baku affords an easy  means of  communicationwith Astrakan and,  by way of  the Volga, with all the main waterways  of Russia,  thusgiving cheap and easy transport for the oil to  the various markets.  The town  itself isa large supply centre  and a depot which feeds  the Caucasus, Transcaspia, and north persia with Russian supplies and foreign imports of all kinds.  Although situated onan inland sea, Baku is the largest shipping centre in the former Russian Empire.  Ithas a fine natural harbour with adequate  docks and repair  yards.  In former times the shipping was mostly built on the Clyde and floated  down the canals  to  the Volgaon pontoons, and  thence to Baku.  However, of  late years  a  certain amount *of construction has been carried  on  in Baku itself.  Apart from its oil, Baku has  also important flour and cotton mills, the latter  being fed by raw cotton from Transcaspia.     The Prime Minister who  formed the  first Cabinet was Khan Khoisky, a highlyeducated and extremely competent lawyer.  He, however, subsequently gave place toM. Ussubekoff, an educated Tartar, of  somewhat broader principles.  It is reported
 that M. Ussubekoff is forming a new Cabinet, on which it is hoped Khan Khoisky will find a place as Minister for Foreign Affairs.     A Cabinet  of which M.  Ussubekolf, Khan Khoisky and General  Mechmandaroff are members would be in a strong position, and likely to  take a liberal outlook on the Armenian question.     As a whole the Azerbaijan Government may be considered more conservative than socialist.   The wealthy merchant class is standing outside the actual  Government, as it considers its influence more powerful when used indirectly. (e.) Daghestan.     This province, formerly under the  native khans, and lying to the north of the main Caucasus  range, was  also  ceded by  Persia to the  Russians  under  the  Treaty of Gulistan in 1813.  It is a mountainous country peopled by wild hill tribes of various origin.  After  the Russian  Revolution  it formed  itself into the  so-called  &quot;North Caucasus Republic,&quot; which sent delegates to  the Peace Conference.   Like Azerbaijan, the province has never been an independent State, and its people seem  even less fit for self-determination.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  have  therefore acquiesced  in  the occupation of the province by Denikm.   The present position seems to be that a large part of the population have accepted the  return to Russian rule, while another part are opposing  the Volunteer Army  by force and  demanding independence or union with Azerbaijan.     Petrovsk is  the Caspian port of  Daghestan.  As  a  port it is inferior to Baku, but it has grown considerably in importance with the expansion of  the Grozni  oil fields (which are themselves situated in the Terek Cossack province).           Character and Aims of Georgia, Armenia,  and Azerbaijan. (a.) Common Factors.     All three Republics have three factors  in common:      .1. Their genuine desire  for independence.     2. Their desire to combat Bolshevism  of  the  Soviet variety  (as distinct from           Socialistic  principles of Government, which are accepted,  notably  by           Georgia).     3. Their fear of Denikin and his policy of a United Russia (this is true in a less           degree of the  Armenians, who  regard their reincorporation in  Russia as           precluded by the  declarations made by the Allies during the war). (b.) Internal Situation of the Republics.     With the exception of Georgia, the Republics suffer considerably from the lack of experienced administrators.   This want adds greatly to  the difficulties of the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia,  both of which have  been devastated during the war to an extent which renders reconstruction of  any  kind the first necessity of the moment.     There are,  nevertheless, hopeful signs.  In Azerbaijan, the town  of Baku is reported to be extremely well  administered.   The  streets are well kept, there is  an efficient police force, and the  tramway  service has recently been restarted.   An army of  about 30,000 men has been created in  spite of difficulties arising from the fact that the Tartars under the old  Russian regime were exempt from military service.    In Armenia, M. Khatissian, the  Prime Minister, is a broad-minded  and honest statesman,  who has sacrificed his important  business  interests  in Georgia in order to devote himself to the service of his native country.    The general internal situation of Armenia owing      (a.)  To the lack of competent administrators, and    (b.)  To the difficult food situation and the  large influx of refugees, can only be           described as deplorable.    Of the three republics, Georgia is  in much the best position.  Her territory has escaped the ravages of war, while her people, who prided  themselves, even under the old Russian regime, on the European origin  of  their civilisation, have  the advantage over their neighbours in ability and culture.  Internal order appears to be well main- tained, and the sporadic outburst of Bolshevism which recur at intervals are put down without difficulty and with commendable  firmness.  Of  late the Georgian Government have complained of the All-Russian propaganda carried on  in this territory by Denikin&apos;sagents and sympathisers sheltering themselves under the British military administration in the  province of Batoum.
     The  economic situation of all the republics is very similar,  their currency forpurposes of foreign trade having depreciated to a point where it is practically valueless,the latest quotation being 7-800 roubles to the pound sterling.  There are practically no imports, and the whole country is suffering from a dearth of manufactured goods,especially agricultural machinery.     The existing railways  are marked on the accompanying map.  The Batoum-Bakurailway runs through the Batoum province, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, while the Batoum,Tiflis, Erivan-Djulfa line passes through Georgia, Armenia, andxAzcrbaijan.  A certainamount of rolling-stock and engines was left after the evacuation of the Russian army in1918, but there is  a very considerable shortage in this respect.  Owing to the lack ofmaterial and skilled labour few repairs have been carried  out.  During the evacuation of the Turkish army after the Armistice, most of the existing  rolling-stock  naturally,accumulated at the points where the Turkish troops  left the  country, notably  Batoumand Kars.   This led to great trouble, each of the Republics refusing to allow rolling-stock  and engines  to leave  its territory.   A British railway control was finallyestablished  and through traffic provided for.   Since  the British evacuation,  the threerepublics have  by mutual consent continued on  the lines  set up  by the  Britishorganisation.  But railway control is still  a fruitful source of friction,  especiallybetween the Georgians and the British authorities  at Batoum, who  have, perforce, touse a Russian staff for the  administration of the line in that province.     A new line was begun by the Russians connecting the Batoum-Baku line at Aliatwith the railhead at Djulfa.  The Azerbaijan Republic is now offering this work as  a concession, and it is even reported to have been definitely acquired by the Italians.(c.) Relations one with the other.         Azerbaijan and Georgia.     These two States  have recently  formed a defensive alliance  against  attack byDenikin, which also provides for arbitration  in territorial  disputes between themselves(see map).     Before this agreement there had been considerable friction between the  republics,due chiefly to the traditional hostility of the Georgians towards the Turks, under whoseauspices the present Azerbaijan Republic was founded.         Georgia and Armenia.     In January 1919 Armenia and  Georgia were drawn by Turkish intrigue (Denikinsupporting Armenia) into war over  the disputed territory of Borchalinsk.  A peace was arranged by the British Command at Tiflis and the disputed province declared to be a neutral zone.  Much of the recent friction between the Armenians and the  Georgiansis due to the friendly attitude of the Armenian &quot; Dashnaktsutiun &quot; to General Denikin.Thanks, however, in large part to  the efforts of the British  Chief  Commissioner  inTranscaucasia relations  have  considerably improved of late,  and  an  agreement hasnow been signed providing for  transit of goods free  of customs duty between  the twacountries.  This  agreement has already resulted  in some  alleviation of the  food situation in Armenia.         Armenia and Azerbaijan.     The  strained relations existing between  these two republics  date back to the1Armenian massacres of 1905 in Baku and  elsewhere in  the Caucasus.  The  feelingsengendered  by these  massacres were further stimulated during  the war  by themassacres and deportations of Armenians  in  Turkey  and,  on the  other  side, bymassacres of Moslems instigated by the &quot; Dashnaktsutiun &quot; in Baku in March 1918 andin Caucasian Armenia in March, April, and May of  the  same  year.  Recent  fightinghas centred round the disputed territories of Nachichevan, Zangazeur, Karabakh, andSharur Daralageuz (see map).     After an unsuccessful  attempt on the  part of  Colonel Haskell, sent out by thePeace Conference  as Allied High Commissioner for Armenia, to settle the quarrel bythe creation  of Nachickbevan as a neutral zone, it is reported in &quot;the last few days that anagreement has been reached to settle territorial disputes  by arrangement or  to  referthem to arbitration pending a decision by the Peace Conference or the Allies.  the credit for this result must be shared by Mr. Wardrop and by Colonel Rhea (acting forColonel Haskell during the  latters absence in Paris), but an early  solution of theTranscaucasian question would seem  to offer  the only effective guarantee  against  a recrudescence of strife.
G (d.)  Position of the Republics vis-a-vis Denikin.      The  absolute  incompatibility of Denikin&apos;s aim of a  reunited Russia  with the aspirations of the republics for independence has already been noted.      The present military position between the two parties has been determined by the following arrangements :       1. On land. Early last summer, while the British troops were still in occupation of Transcaucasia, it was thought necessary to draw a dividing line between the spheres of Denikin and his Volunteer Army and that of the republics.  This line follows in the main the central  Caucasus range.   But at its eastern  and western extremities it  has twice been  subsequently modified (see map), partly at least under the pressure of events, especially in the case of Daghestan, where the  whole province is  now  occupied by Denikin, and where His Majesty&apos;s Government have not felt called upon to embark on a serious dispute with him  on behalf of a  people whose character holds out no prospect  of the creation on a stable basis of an  independent State.  The opposition which Denikin  has been experiencing from part  of the Daghestan population is freely attributed by him, not altogether without justification,  to  the intrigues of Georgia and Azerbaijan, and the situation in Daghestan is therefore a potential danger to the whole peace of the Caucasus.      On the west the dividing line was  finally  fixed on the  River Bzyb,  but  the Georgians still  maintain forces at Gagri  on the ground that the Bzyb  river is an indefensible front.   This question is a lively  source  of friction, and  Denikin has recently refused to receive a Georgian deputation until the withdrawal to the Bzyb has taken place.      2. On sea. As a necessary preliminary to the withdrawal of the British troops from  Transcaucasia (with the exception of Batoum)  which took  place last August, the British naval  flotilla in  the Caspian, composed almost entirely of former Russian vessels, was handed over to General Denikin on the express  stipulation that he should not attempt to force his way into the port of Baku.  While he has so far observed this stipulation, he has invoked  the Russo-Persian Treaty of  Turkmanchai to  prevent the Azerbaijan flag being shown in the Caspian either on merchant or war vessels.     In the Black Sea the presence of a British  naval force acted as a deterrent to Denikin&apos;s war vessels until the Georgians definitely refused to withdraw their forces on the Black Sea littoral to the south of the River Bzyb.  Denikin then seized a Georgian guardship off Gagri which, at our request, had been previously disarmed,  and one of his warships exchanged several shots with the Georgian  guardship at Poti.  Against this action the Georgians have entered an official protest.     The hardly latent hostility  between  Denikin and the  republics,  with the ever present danger of an explosion,  is the key to the whole trans caucasian position at the present time.   Denikin has lately been reported  to  consider himself in a state of  war with  Georgia, and at the  time  of  writing is said also to contemplate an attack  on Baku, tempted by the prospect of controlling the oil supply there.   He has  recently brought  economic weapons  to bear e.g., he  has imposed  strict  export  restrictions against the republics in the area under his control while the Georgians complain that his representatives at Batoum are carrying on All-Russia propaganda in that province, and are doing their best to discredit and  depreciate the Georgian currency.. (e.) The Republics  and Bolshevism.    Azerbaijan may be regarded as anti-Bolshevik, owing to  the influence of the large Tartar landowners or khans  and to the&apos; presence of a wealthy commercial community. But there is a large Russian working population in Baku which is distinctly Bolshevik in tendency, and is  supported by  the Moslem society known as  &quot; Gurnet,&quot; which is supposed also to be in close touch with the Committee of Union and Progress.     The Armenians in  the  Caucasus were regarded by  the former Russian  Govern- ment since 1905  as constituting the  extreme  revolutionary element in that  region. The Dashnaktsutiun  is of  extreme Socialist tendency, but has in the past identified itself impartially with Bolshevism  or  reaction, in accordance with its own interests. The pernicious  influence of this  society has already been commented upon, but  the vagaries of Armenian&apos; politics can only  be fairly appreciated if it is remembered that the Armenians in the Caucasus are surrounded  on all  sides by hostile peoples, and that the experience of  history has taught them  to  regard  self-preservation  as  the  one essential tenet of political faith.    The accusation of Bolshevik tendencies is so freely brought against Georgia thatit  is  perhaps worth while pausing  to  examine how far it may be regarded as well-
                                                                             H2                                        sr.founded.  During the last decade the middle and lower classes in Georgia have shown,very  distinct  socialistic and  revolutionary tendencies.  Two of  the  leaders of theRussian  revolution under Kerensky  were  Georgians Cheidze  and Tseretelli.  Theprobable reason  for the attitude of  the Georgian  people was Russian oppression inwhich the Russianised  Georgian aristocracy took a leading part.     At the time of the  Bolshevik coup  d&apos;Etat the  country was riddled with extremesocialism, and the Bolsheviks looked like getting the upper hand.  The  GeorgianPremier, M. Jordani, a democrat, but by no  means a socialist, realised that he had no material  force other than two regiments of Georgian cavalry, led by reactionary Georgianofficers, with which to fight this internal movement; while on the other hand, owing to thedesertion of the front by the Russian  armies,  Georgia was  exposed to invasion by the turk.  In pursuance of the old Russian policy of employing  troops at a distance fromtheir homes, the Georgian soldiers were on the  north-west front  in Russia, and it was known that they were deserting and returning to Georgia with their arms.  Tney weresaturated with Bolshevist doctrines, and the position seemed hopeless.     M.  Jordani therefore invited  the Socialists to  join his Government, declared  aSocialist  republic, nationalised  all  the land, and promised  to nationalise all  industry.The Georgian army refused to continue  the war, and the  Georgian Government  thenaccepted Germany&apos;s offer of (1) financial assistance ; (2) a brigade to maintain internal order; (3)  a guarantee that  Germany&apos;s  ally, Turkey, would  under no circumstancescross the frontiers of Georgia.  In fairness to the Georgians  and M. Jordani, it  mustbe remembered that a request for assistance in  money and troops was first  addressedto the British  Military  Mission, then at Tiflis, who gave some financial assistance, but were unable at that time to provide troops  or accord recognition. From  that date(May-June 1918)  the  whole of the  energies  of  the  Georgian  Government led byJordani  and Gegechkori have been  centred on reconstruction  on  social-democratic principles,  and on the expulsion of  the Bolshevik elements. Out of the  chaos hasevolved civilised  government; private ownership is permitted  up to a limit, order ismaintained, and of the three republics Georgia  is the most prosperous.   The Govern-ment and the mass of the people are violently anti-communist.  But their independenceis to them  a very real issue,  and  since Lenin has offered to recognise them  as anindependent State, it is more than probable that, if the test  came,  they would recognise the Soviet Government as representing Russia rather than Denikin.(f.) Relations to the Pan-Turanian Movement.     Pan-Turanian, Turkish, or Pan-Islamic influences play no part  in Georgia orArmenia, and  by the nature of their history and their religion this block of  ChristianStates will  always  be actively hostile  to  any Moslem  movement.   The  GeorgianMussulman seems to be primarily Georgian, and his Turkish or Pan-Islamic tendenciesare mainly sentimental.     In Azerbaijan and Daghestan, however, matters are  different.  While  neither ofthese peoples has any desire to come under Turkish domination, in both countries  thereis a strong Pan-Islamic movement in  existence,  and many well-known agitators are atwork.(g.) Relations to  Persia.     These are of special importance in the case of  Azerbaijan.     The Azerbaijan is of the same  religion (Shiah Moslem),  and  speaks  the  sameTurki language  as  the Persian inhabitants of  the northern  provinces of Persia,including Ghilan and Persian Azerbaijan (the  name &quot; Azerbaijan&quot; was  given to therepublic  under Turkish auspices in the expectation that a peace imposed by the CentralPowers would provide for  the incorporation of Persian Azerbaijan in the  republic).EBusiness ties  between the two countries are, moreover, traditionally close.  The  effectof this connection, especially since the Anglo-Persian agreement, has been to strengthen the British  position in Azerbaijan, which,  before&apos; launching  out into any definite policy, is undoubtedly waiting to judge the real strength and  tendencies  of British influence in Persia.               Commitments of the Allies towards Transcaucasia.(a.) Of the Peace Conference.     The Peace Conference have allowed delegates  of the republics to. come to  Paris.and state their case,  and have given sympathetic but non-committal replies.
    The Supreme Council have also despatched an &quot; Allied High  Commissioner  for&quot;Armenia&quot;  (an  American officer, Colonel Haskell)  to Transcaucasia  with his staff.This mission has concerned itself primarily with relief work, the main burden of whichhas been borne  by the American Relief Commission, an unofficial organisation reportedto have expended  recently about  600,0001 per month in Armenia alone.  But it has -also exercised a restraining influence in questions of disputed territory, and is no doubt;entitled to a share of the credit for  the- recent arrangements providing for a peaceful settlement of these issues.(b.) Of  the Individual Allies.    The British occupied the principal points in Transcaucasia on  the  conclusion of&quot;the Turkish Armistice.   The  primary function of  our troops was to secure thewithdrawal  of the Turkish forces from the  confines of  the former Russian Empire.When this had been accomplished, and for reasons of economy, the British forces were withdrawn (last August) except from Batoum.    During our occupation the British Military Command gave local recognition to thevarious Governments and  administrative bodies  which they found in existence, and announced by proclamation that the occupation was in accordance with the Armistice,and that they had no intention of interfering with the internal politics of the country.No other recognition beyond general messages  of  sympathy  has  been granted therepublics by His Majesty&apos;s Government.  But,  as  already stated,  Mr.  Wardrop was sent to Tiflis on the withdrawal of our troops with the title of &quot; British Chief Commis-sioner in Transcaucasia,&quot;  and with instructions to use  his best offices to keep therepublics (a) from fighting  among themselves,  (b) from giving any provocation toGeneral Denikin.    Next to this country  among  the Allies the  Italians have  played  the mostconspicuous part in Transcaucasia since the Armistice.  In the early  spring of this year the Peace Conference offered to entrust the control of these regions to Italy.  This was refused after the lapse of some weeks, but an Italian military mission was sent out toTiflis, where it still is.  Meanwhile  there has  been a great development  of  Italiancommercial activity, and the Italian Government are considering the idea of supporting the repubhVs  claims to independence in  return for the promise  of concessions, ofwhich Transcaucasia, rich in oil, timber, coal, and metal ores,  can offer enough andto- spare.  The sinister feature in these proceedings is  that there is  good ground to suppose the Italians to be screening German commercial interests, which are far fromreconciled  to  the permanent loss of the commercial plums  secured  to  them  by  theGerman-Georgian Treaty of May-June 1918.  German prestige stands high in Georgiaowing to the support given against the Turks,  and the  presence in Georgia for somemonths before the Armistice of a picked garrison of German troops.The  trans caucasian Problem.     The trans caucasian problem  is bound up with the greater question  of Russia.This  point  has been sufficiently brought out in the above notes and need  not be-laboured.  In the case of Georgia and Azerbaijan,  inclusion as autonomous provincesin a  federated Russia would be a  compromise which need not perhaps  be ruled out.The future of Armenia seems at the present time to depend  on whether  a mandatoryPower can be found to accept the responsibility for  watching over her development.     The connection of Transcaucasia with the  Turkish settlement is much less close.The only direct link is the territorial question as regards the new Armenian  State, and,less directly, the  possible&apos; repercussion of  the  peace terms on Azerbaijan with  herPan-Islamic tendencies.     But, apart from these considerations, Great  Britain, as  an Eastern Power, cannotdisinterest herself from  the trans caucasian  settlement.   Transcaucasia is one of themost important gateways to the East.  Her railways (Batoum-Baku and Batoum-Tiflis-Julfa) lead respectively to the Caspian and so to Krasnovodsk and Turkestan, seethingwith Bolshevik and Pan-Islamic agitation,  and into Persia, where Great Britain hasrecently assumed new responsibilities.   The projected Aliat-Julfa  line,  originallysurveyed by the Russians, and for the construction of which  the Azerbaijanis  are now seeking foreign assistance, will link up the two systems and allow the  currents of tradeand propaganda carried by the one to be easily diverted to  the other.   It would seemessential that the countries through which  pass these vital  arteries of communication between East and West should be  both prosperous and well-disposed to Great Britainand to British policy.
oThe Question  of Recognition.    It must be conceded at once that Armenia is in a different position from Georgiaand  Azerbaijan in  this respect,  since all the Allied Powers  during the war have committed themselves more or less directly to the creation of ah independent ArmenianState under a European or an American mandate.   The only question to be decided inthe case  of Armenia is  the extent of Turkish territory which should be added to theErivan Republic to  make up the new State-     Turning to Georgia and  Azerbaijan, the claim of the former to  an independentexistence is infinitely stronger than that of Azerbaijan.  Georgia has had a long historyas an  independent  State,  and possesses a cohesion and capacity for  self-governmentmuch  superior to those hitherto manifested by the  mixed population of  Azerbaijan.The latter, like Daghestan,-was for centuries  under Persian rule, and has no more moralclaim  to independence  than have the inhabitants  of  the Persian provinces of Ghilanand  Azerbaijan.  At  the  same  time  it is very difficult,  if not  impossible,  to treatGeorgia in one way and Azerbaijan in another.  If the Russians are allowed to cross the Caucasus range and occupy Azerbaijan at one end of the Batoum-Baku  railway, theliberties of Georgia can never be secure.  On the  other hand, in the absence of anymore definite expression  of  local opinion  in favour of  such  a course, it would be-difficult  for  His Majesty&apos;s Government  to consent  to   the reincorporation  of theRepublic of Azerbaijan, carrying with it  of course Baku and its  vast oil resources, in persia.  Such a  step would  be resented  more bitterly by Russians  of all shades ofpolitical opinion than the establishment of Azerbaijan as an independent State.     For practical purposes it must therefore be assumed that the two republics mustbe treated on the same footing.   The problem then becomes largely one of     (a.) How far we are prepared to affront Denikin and the All-Russia party, and     (b.) How much importance  we attach to the creation of  buffer  States  between           Persia and the reconstituted Russia of the  future.     An idea which appears to command a considerable amount of sympathy among the advocates of a federated Russia is that the independence of the republics should be immediately recognised by the Allies, and that they should be  placed under  a british or American mandate,  pending the formation of the League of Nations.   Recognitionshould be dependent on the agreement of  the Republics concerned (including possiblyArmenia) to form  a federated  State, and should be  followed by a declaration of themandatory Power&apos;s willingness to extend its mandate  over any autonomous part of theformer Russian Empire, provided its governing body  is formed on a democratic basis.It is  anticipated that the immediate effect  of  this step would  be  to secure the incorporation of the Don, Terek and Kuban Cossack districts, followed by the Ukraine,in the new federated State.   This latter  would gradually extend all over the former russian Empire, forming a democratic federated republic in which there would be noroom for Bolshevism.     Action on these lines could hardly fail to bring the  mandatory Power into acuteconflict with Denikin and the All-Russia party, and to involve responsibilities which no.single Allied Power would probably care to undertake at the present time.     Another  alternative  would  be to  continue to abstain  from  recognising  theindependence of Georgia and Azerbaijan until General Denikin&apos;s position becomes more certain,  whilst putting  pressure on him not to attack  either of these two Republics.     A third alternative would be to recognise  the independence  of Georgia and Azerbaijan forthwith, subject  to the decision of  the League of Nations  in,  say, five years&apos; time as to their reincorporation, as autonomous States, in a Russia reconstituted on a federal basis.  Prompt action on these lines might possibly restrain General Denikin from employing  the winter months in the subjugation of Transcaucasia, which there  is every indication  that he  is at present contemplating.  On the  other hand, it may be doubted whether qualified recognition of this kind would  be by itself sufficient to force him and the party  for which he stands into the arms of Germany.
