    I  CIRCULATE  to the  Cabinet the  Report  of  the  fourmeetings  of  the  Conference  held  between M.  Berthelot  and myself at the  Foreign  Office last  week, in  order  to  work  outthe details  of a common  plan for  the  settlement of  the peacewith  Turkey  at the  forthcoming  Peace  Conference  at  Paris.Attached to the  Report will be found  the French draft  scheme(prepared  by  M.  Berthelot  after the  recent   Conferences  inDowning Street)  together  with  the  British  observations  upon it,  which  provided  the  basis  of  our  discussion,  as  well  as a french memorandum on Armenia.

CONFIDENTIAL.  fj^Qp- J^&apos;     i0ANGLO-FRENCH  CONFERENCE ON THE TURKISH SETTLEMENT.Minutes of First  Meeting of an Anglo-French Conference in the Secretary of State&apos;s        Room at 11*45 A.M. on December 22, regarding the Turkish Settlement.    THE following were present at the first meeting:          For France              M. Berthelot, Chief Secretary for Political and Commercial Affairs at the                 French Foreign Office, and             M. de Fleuriau, Minister Plenipotentiary and Counsellor of the French                 Embassy.         For Great Britain              Earl Curzon of Kedleston, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.             Mr. Armitage Smith,  of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.             Mr. Vansittart    )  n.   ^&amp;             Mr. Forbes Adam j of the ForeiSn 0ffice&apos;                         Lord. Curzon took the Chair.Basis of Discussion.    Lord Curzon  suggested that  it would  be convenient to take as the  basis  ofdiscussion the first part  of M.  Berthelofs note of the 12th December, point by point,together with the British observations upon it (see Appendix to this Minute).    In  reply to M. Berthelot, who explained that the French note had been hurriedlyprepared, Lord Curzon said  that it seemed to him to present an excellent statement ofthe case.Italian evacuation of Southern Anatolia.    Lord Curzon first touched on the paragraph on page 4 of the French note regardingthe principle of particular spheres of influence in Turkey, and asked whether M. Berthelotintended this to cover the spheres of economic priority.  It might then  be difficult togive Italy the quid pro quo, which was apparently required under the Treaty of London,to induce her  to evacuate Southern Anatolia.  M. Berthelot stated  that he did  not intend the expression to exclude the grant of special economic privileges to  Italy.  he knew that Signor Tittoni,  and he  believed also M. Scialoija, would accept some suchsettlement of the Italian claims in Southern Anatolia.Constantinople and the Straits.    The next question discussed was the new regime for Constantinople and the Straits(pages 4 and 5 of the French note).Composition of International Commission.    M.  Berthelot  stated  that  the  French Government favoured the administrationbeing entrusted  to a Commission  composed of France, Great Britain, Italy, Russia (if and when reconstituted), and possibly also Roumania and Greece, for economic (shipping)reasons.   France would not, however, much object  to eventual participation of  theUnited  States.   He thought  that possibly the Great Powers should alone have  votes,and the smaller Powers be represented in a purely  consultative capacity.   Lord Curzonand Mr. Vansittart pointed out that this might well lead to difficulties: for instance.&apos;allthe arguments for Italian participation in  the  new  State  could be  used  even more strongly in the case of Greece.    Mr. Yansittart raised the question of the entry of Bulgaria, if and when she became a  member of the League  of Nations,  and pointed out that this  would involve  theconsideration of the case of Germany.      [1845]                    &apos;                 ,                      B
       M. Berthelot replied that the latter was a point to be considered later.       Mr. Vansittart suggested that, while the smaller Powers might be  admitted into  the  Commission in an executive and not consultative  capacity/the voting  might be  weighted in favour of the Great Powers.   There was a recent precedent for this in the  procedure adopted by the Financial Commission at the Peace Conference at Paris.       M. de Fleuriau thought this might be  difficult, and suggested that  France, Great  Britain, and Italy should be empowered by the Treaty to set up a de facto administra-  tion, and the conditions for subsequent admission of other States might be settled later  by them.       M. Berthelot supported his proposal.       Lord  Curzon pointed  out  that  it was essential  to  settle  now  the question  of  principle involved in the representation of the  different Powers, both  small and great.  It was much better  that  the Treaty itself  should contain a list of the Powers to  be  represented, and define their voting strength.  He proposed that France,  Great Britain,  Italy,  Russia  (if and when  she  became not only reconstituted  but also united), the  United States (if they will agree  to participation), Greece, Roumania, Turkey (at once),  and  perhaps Bulgaria (if and when she became a member  of the League of Nations)  should be represented on the Commission.   The first four Powers (and America if she  joined) should  be represented by two Delegates each, with one vote to each Delegate,  and  the three or four smaller Powers by one Delegate each, each Delegate having one  vote.       This suggestion was accepted.  Chairmanship of International Commission.       The question of the chairman (p. 6 of the French note) was then discussed.       M. Berthelot did not favour  the idea of rotation proposed by the  British.  There  were possible objections to an American chairman,  as the interests of America were not  so vitally at stake as France and Great Britain.  There was still greater objection to  an  Italian chairman.  He suggested that France  might accept the principle of rotation  among the Delegates of Great Britain and France.  The period should  be one year.       Lord Curzon thought that two years would be a more convenient  period  than one  year, and proposed that the French point of view would really be met in a manner less  likely  to encounter  hostility from the other Powers if it  were laid down  that the  chairman of the  International Commission should always be drawn from  and chosen  by  the  representatives of the Great Powers and that he should sit for two years.  As the  only Great Powers likely to be represented at first on the Commission would (in the  probable absence of America) be  France,  Great Britain, and Italy, it might be privately  arranged between the two former that the chairmanship for the first period  should  go  to France and for the second period to Great Britain, or vice versa.  In theory  Italy  would not thus be excluded.       To meet a difficulty raised by M. Berthelot, Lord Curzon also proposed that, in the  case of the vote being even  in the election of the chairman, the casting vote  should  be  given  by the outgoing chairman.   This would mean that for the first six  years, at any  rate, Great Britain and France would really decide the elections.       At this stage M. Berthelot said that M. Clemenceau had instructed  him specially  to point out in confidence that the French Government had originally  not favoured the  policy of expelling the Turks from Europe, the difficulties of which  they fully realised,  but  that they had deferred to the superior arguments of the British Government.  They  presumed, therefore, that the British Government were determined  to carry through  this policy and would not go back on it or them.       Lord Curzon in reply said that, no final decision had been reached by the Cabinet  on  the  matter,  and  that  although Mr.  Balfour, Mr.  Lloyd George and himself,  favoured a policy of expulsion, any  decisions reached at the present  Conferences with  M. Berthelot were subject to revision or  confirmation by both the French and British  Governments.  Frontiers of New State.       The next point discussed was the question of the frontiers of the  zone (page ,6  of  the  French note).       It was agreed that the European land frontier should be the Enos-Midia line to be  defined  later on  by an  expert  Commission.  It was also agreed that the British  suggestion that the Shile-Gebse  line should be taken as the frontier of the zone at theA Bosphorus s*oi should be accepted, but it might be necessary to substitute for Gebse a V point  between Gebse and Ismid.   It  was thought  desirable that a  similar  zone
25  kilom. in  depth running  from  a  point  opposite  to  Tenedos  to a  point&apos; about25  kilom. on  the  coast of the Sea of Marmora east of the end  of the  Dardanelles&apos;should be treated similarly and included in the zone.  On the other hand  the wholecoast line of  the Sea of Marmora  between Gebse  and the point  to be determinedupon as  the  eastern  end of the  frontier of the zone on the Asiatic  shore of theDardanelles including Panderma and Mudania should be excluded and left to  the Turks.Thus the  territory to be administered by the  International Commission on the Asiaticcoast would be confined to the zones abutting on the two Straits of the Dardanelles andthe Bosphorus.     M. Berthelot also agreed to the British proposal  to  demilitarize  the Turkish coast-line and demolish all fortifications on the south shore of the Sea of Marmora.Mosques in Constantinople.     It was proposed and agreed upon after a short discussion that an article should beincluded in the Peace Treaty to the effect that all Mosques  in  Constantinople shouldbe  respected and  continued as  Moslem places of worship, and that  if any  differentialtreatment were thought  necessary for Santa  Sofia, it might be  treated as an ancientmonument in  which all  denominations and  creeds would have  an  equal interest, but which should not be used for purposes of religious worship by any particular faith.League  of Nations and New State.     At this point Lord Curzon explained to M. Berthelot that he considered it  most desirable that the establishment of the New State under an international regime shouldbe  placed in some  way under the general protection of the  League of Nations.  Thiswas not only important from the point of view of the acceptance of the settlement byall  the  Powers, but he  believed that  the Turk,  who  was understood to regard theLeague already as something  imposing and  sacred, would  be  more ready to acceptexpulsion from Constantinople if the League were in some general way to be made  his successor.     He did not think it necessary that the protection of the League should involve anyvery direct interference in the administration, but it would be well if in case of financial or administrative difficulties the International Commission controlling the State  couldcall in the help of the League, and if in the event  of any constitutional  change being required, the League could be  invoked with regard to it.  .     M. Berthelot  stated that he accepted the point in principle.  He  thought that possibly the future legislative body (see p.  7  of the French note, which speaks of thepossibility of control by an elective assembly), or the  future constitution  of  the nativeGovernment of the new State, might be worked out in consultation with the Council ofthe League of Nations.     It was finally  agreed that both the British and the  French should try to work out some formula.Administration of New State.     Lord Curzon then pointed  out that the British  observations  on this part of theFrench  note raised the general question as to the degree of elaboration required in thedepartmental Government of the new State, and how  far the  Turkish officials of the oldTurkish Government should be encouraged to stay on  and  take part in  it.  It was important that there should be a small number of departments and as little expenditure as possible.     M. Bertheiot thought that details might  be worked out, as in the case of UpperSilesia, by a special commission working in Paris.Danger of Economic Disaster at Constantinople.&apos;     At this point  Mr. Armitage Smith explained the  danger that a too  precipitateexpulsion of the Turk from Constantinople  might result in an economic situation similarto that in Vienna.   M. Berthelot pointed out that  it was generally agreed that this could be avoided by arranging the  transfer of the staff of  the  Turkish Governmentdepartments and their dependents to Konia or Brusa very gradually  or over a period of six  or eight  months, and that the transfer should not be concluded before accommodation at Konia or  Brusa was ready.  It would, however, be  necessary to  see  that  the Turksdid not  abuse this privilege.   This could be dooe by the Commission  at Constantinople.                    (The meeting then adjourned until 3 dclock.)
Appendix to Minutes of First Meeting.First part of M. Berthelotfs note of the 12th December with comments of Political                    Section of British Peace DelegationBritish Observations.No comments on this paragraph.  We are in general agreement with, thefirst  paragraphs  of the French  Memo-randum,  and note with satisfaction the degree to which the French Governmentare prepared to meet the views  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  Presumably   the   words   &quot;spheresd&apos;influence particulieres&apos;&apos;  are intendedto cover  spheres of  economic priority.We are doubtful if it may not be neces-sary to give  Italy some such sphere in southern Anatolia in order to secure thewithdrawal of her troops.  This point isfurther dealt with below.  DES conversations echangees entre M.Lloyd  George  and M.  Clemenceau,  ilresulte essentiellement que, en presencede  1&apos;etat  d&apos;esprit  aux  Etats-Unis,  duretard et des reserves apportees a la rati-fication du Traite de  Paix avec 1&apos;Alle-magne et du doute qui en resulte quant ala participation effective de 1&apos;Ameriqueaux reglements politiques europeens etorientaux,  la  France  et  la  Grande-Bretagne jugent indispensable a, la paixdu  monde et a 1&apos;avenir de 1&apos;Europe uneentente etroite entre elles.  Cette ententedoit se manifester le plus tot possible par un  accord sur les  questions  qui  lesinteressent et  a propos  desquelles  leurspoints de  vue n&apos;ont  pas encore 6teajustes.

I. TURQUIE.   La  conversation  du11 decembre au Foreign Office entre M.Lloyd George et Lord  Curzon d&apos;une part,le President   du  Conseil  frangais  de1&apos;autre,  a  permis   de   constater  queT opinion  du Gouvernement britanniqueetait difierente de celle du Gouvernementfrangais sur certains,  points importants.Dependant  il  n&apos;est   pas  impossibled&apos;arriver a un compromis moyennant desconcessions de part et d&apos;autre.   Ce quisuit expose sur quels  points M.  Clemen-Clemenceau est dispose&quot; a se rallier au point de vue britannique et sur  quels points  ildemande 1&apos;assenti.ment  britannique auxconceptions franchises.  Les deux Gouvernements sont d&apos;accorden principe pour n&apos;admettre ni mandats,ni spheres d&apos;influence particulieres (saufdans les territoires de Syrie et  de  Meso-potamie d^finis dans les accords de  1916).(A.) Constantinople et les Detroits.  M. Clemenceau a d fendu, au cours dela Conference du 11 Novembre, la these
  This is true, but it must be rememberedthat British  commercial  interests were,before the war, nearly twice those of anyother Power.   For  instance,  in 1913Great Britain  had  26.7 of  the wholetrade of Turkey (imports and exports),Germany 14.7, France 12.3, Austria 12.2,and Italy 10.5.&quot;We agree generally to all 4 points.du maintien du Sultan a Constantinople.Cette these a de nombreux partisans enFrance parce que les interets materiels etmoraux de la France sont plus developpesdans  1&apos;ancienne   Turquie   que  ceuxd&apos;aucun  autre pays.  Elle y possede a1&apos;heure  actuelle la grande  majqrite  descapitaux des chemins de fer et des entre-prises d&apos;interet public et prive oh, avant1914;elle avait plac6 plus de 3 milliards;elle  possede  une grande  partie de  la dette Publique  Ottoman et exercait uneinfluence  predominate dans 1&apos;admini-stration  dite des  Revenus concedes  oudans  celle de la Regie de Tabacs.  Soninfluence morale etait assuree et  propageepar des centaines d&apos;ecoles et  d&apos;etablisse-ments de bienfaisance, tant religieux quelaiques, repartis dans toutes les villes de1&apos;Empire ottoman. Aussi Yopinion fran-gaise est elle favorable au maintien dePancienne Turquie, systeme dont la sim- plicite  plait a  beaucoup  d&apos;esprits  pra- artistiques et qui menage  les  susceptibility d&apos;une Russie reconstitute.   Cependant M.  Clemenceau est dispose a se  rallier  aux  vues du Gouvernement britannique  : il apprecie a leur  va^r les (\J arguments tir s de la difficulte  de garder les Detroits  sans une force militaire  con- siderable et de lourdes depenses si Con- stantinople  et  ses  5.00,000  habitants restaient entre les mains  du  Sultan et par consequent a la merci des intrigues d&apos;une Allemagne reconstituee  militaire- ment et peut-etre appuyee par  la Russie.   D&apos;ailleurs, en  rompant la paix et les traites qui assuraient son inttgrite terri- toriale  et  sa  souverainete la Turquie a delie les Puissances  allites  de  toute obligation autre que le respect des prin- cipes directeurs de leur politique.    En fermant les Detroits, elle a coupe&apos; les com- munications de la Russie avec  les Allies, caus6 son effrondrement politique et mili- taire et prolonge la guerre, avec tons ses dtsastres: une telle catastrophe ne  doit pouvoir se renouveler.   Le Gouvernement  frangais  se  interalliees- rait  done aux principes suivants :   (1.) Le militarisme ottoman sera  sup- prim6 comme le militarisme  prussien.   (2.) La garde  des D6troits, de la Mer Noire a  la  Mtditerrante, sera confiee a une organisation internationale assurant la neutrality effective du passage.   (3.) Les  Armtniens  seront  affranchis de la domination turque.   (4.) Les populations arabe et syrienne ne peuvent etre replacees sous la domina- tion turque.  On  sera  ainsi conduit  a  discernerquatre problemes: (a) Constantinople et
  We agree to conclusions, but, as a pointof  detail,  the   statement  that-  the christian minorities are of the same raceas Musulman majorities in Armenia may-be contested.  We  agree,  but would  wish  to  putforward  the  possibility  of subsequentAmerican as of Eussian participation.We accept also the principle of the par-ticipation of other interested States, suchas Greece and Eoumania, on  condition that the  real voting  power is left in thehands of the principal Allied and Asso-ciated  Powers.   We would,  however,point out that, unless the control  is fromthe first confined to the latter,  it  may bedifficult,  if not  impossible, to  excludeGermany^ Bulgaria,  and Turkey, if andwhen, they become members of the Leagueof Nations.  We  are  prepared to accept  french proposals regarding  Chairmanship, butwe venture to suggest that, if the Chair-manship of the Commission were eitheroffered   permanently  to  the  Americanmember (on the assumption that Americaparticipates at  once)  or  were  maderotatory,   less^hoapitality  from  other.interested States  would be encountered,as the predominance of France and GreatBritain   would  not  be  so  definitelymarked.   We agree generally, but are not whollyin  favour of  including a  zone  on the asiatic shore.  There might be  legitimateeconomic  objection  to  cutting  off theTurkish interior from such natural out-lets as Haidar Pasha, Mudania and Pan-derma.   Moreover,  the  settlement,  as  awhole, would appear more arbitrary and less acceptable to Moslem feeling,  and,therefore, more difficult of enforcement,if any part of Asia  were included in the zone.   No clearly corresponding advan-tage to  the Allies would, on  the  otherhand, be gained. There is, however, muchto be said oh commercial grounds for in-cluding  the Ismid  Peninsula  up to theShile-Ghebse line in the  zone,  as  theeconomic life of the  two sides of the Bos-phorus largely interpenetrate, and theles  Detroits,  (b)  Anatolie   ou   Asie-Mineure, (c) Armenie, (d) Syrie, Mesopo-tamie,  Arabic   Partout, vivent cote acote Chretiens  et   musulmans.

line  forms  a  convenient, geographicalfrontier.  Shile may also be developed asa health resort, attract visitors  and be-come a desirable source of revenue to the zone.   &apos;  For purposes of defence it would onlyseem necessary to demilitarise an area (15to 20 miles  deep) from a point  oppositeTenedos to Shile, to demolish all f ortifica-tions arid to ensure permanent rights of landing and inspection for the officers ofthe zone on  the Asiatic shore.  A mixedmilitary and naval Commission  might also be  appointed  under the Treaty ofPeace to consider and recommend to theAllies what military and naval fortifications-tions  should be  maintained  and trans-f erred to the international Adminstrationon the European shore of the Dardanelles,Bosphorus and Sea of Marmora, with aview to safeguard freedom of navigationthrough the Straits in peace and war.All fortifications other than  those whichthe Commission should decide to be neces-sary for the above purposes should bedemolished.   The revenues of  the new international     lYEtat nouveau reprendrait sa part deState will probably not  suffice  for some   la Dette ottomane et des engagements con-time to meet the expenses of the Adminis-   tractes par la Turquie.tration.  It will be for the governments represented in the Administration to con-sider whether  they will be  prepared to advance to the new State a sum  of moneyto cover the immediate deficit between theannual budget of the State and the totalrequired to pay  the  expenses  and  theservice of the State&apos;s  allotted portion ofthe pre-war Ottoman Debt, or whether itwould  not  be  preferable  to  relieve  the State of the payment of this debt service for a certain number of years and recoupthe bondholders from  other sources.                                           Les  interets existants de la  Grande-   We  are   in  general  agreement.   In  Bretagne et cte la France devraient etregreater detail our views are as follows :-  respectes, d&apos;Etat  aurait une  autonomie The International  Commission of the new  interieure et serait administre par ou sous State  would have  legislative authority,   la controle d&apos;une assemblee elective. and the executive would consist of the necessary departments (Interior, Justice, Defence, Public Health and Instruction, Finance and  Customs,  Public &apos;Works, Commerce  and  Navigation, Posts  and Telegraphs and Evkaf).   These would be staffed by natives  in  all the  subordinate posts,  and consist largely of foreigners chosen irrespective of nationality in the higher ones.   All  appointments would be made by the Commission.  Representation of the governed in the matter of legisla- tion is  an  eventual necessity. . The  pre- transferable and, indeed,  the only  practical, course is that this  should be elaborated by the Commission  after  full  consultation wdth the inhabitants of the new State.
   We are again in general agreement.Two  points, however must be noted:    1.  The French memorandum speaks of&quot;une organisation judiciaire  etudiee.&quot;This question has already been consideredboth by Paris and by the Allied Repre-sentatives at  Constantinople.    It&apos; isgenerally accepted that the capitulationsin their pre-war form must  disappear.The question  &quot;of the regime  to succeedthem  being,  however,  excedingly  com-plicated,  there is equal agreement thata special Commission must be constituted under the treaty to  elaborate the  neces-sary details on the spot.   2. We  agree  that  financial control should  be very close  (&quot; tres  etroit&quot;).The French proposal, however, contem-plates that it should be exercised through a   developed   and    internationalisedadministration of the Public Debt,  whichwould, in fact, control the budget of thecountry.   With this proposal  we only partiallyagree.  The method which we advocateis  rather that the financial control should fall into three categories :    (a.) A revised debt  administration as      proposed by the French.   (&amp;.) An international currency board.   (c.) Detailed control through an inter-      national  financial  commission of      the Ministry  of Finance and  all      financial  departments.(B.) Turquie a&quot;Asie.  En  Asie  Mineure  subsisterait  uneTurquie, sous la dynastie nationale desOsmanlis, parce  que c&apos;est seulement enAnatolie que les Turcs torment le fond dela population, avec sur la frange cotiereune active population grecque, nombreusesur tout a Y Guest autour de Smyrne et auNord vers Samsoun et Trebizonde. Cestun  pays  de  500,000  kilometres carres et10,000,000 d&apos;habitants, ce qui corresponda la surface de PEspagne.  Nous pour-instructions accepter Fidee panturque de recon-stituer ce qui reste de la Turquie autourdes  cinq villes  des  hauts  plateaux(Koniah, Kaisarieh,  Angora,  Siwas etErzeroum)   sur  la  base linguistique etraciale turque,  car le sentiment  nationalde  la Turquie  d&apos;Asie est prrofond etnullement factice.  Le sultan, installe aKoniah, continuerait d&apos;y regner sous uncontrole financier tres etroit, et avec uneorganisation  judiciaire  etudiee.   LesPuissances exerceraient un controle finan-cier  au  moyen  du  developpement  dePAdministration de  la Dette  PubliqueOttomane, rendue internationale: cetteAdministration  assurerait la rentree detons les impots et paierait les depenses de1&apos;Etat dans  des conditions  qui  seraientfixees de  maniere a assurer la reforme et le   fonctionnement des  administrationsottomanes.  His Majesty&apos;s Treasury have long andcarefully  investigated  this   question.They have come to the conclusion that the gravity of the  economic and financial situation in Turkey involves not only theinterests of the bondholders but the entireindustrial and commercial reconstruction of the  country.   Something more, there-fore, than a reform of the debt adminis-tration is  essential.     Details  of theBritish proposals are in readiness.  Au point de vue moral et historique1&apos; eviction d&apos;Europe d&apos;un Etat bas6 sur le droit de conquete et 1&apos;oppression de racesdifferentes  et  de civilisation superieurerepresente  un triomphe  du Droit.

La prisede  Constantinople  par les Turcs avaitmarque la fin du moyen age. Leur exodemarquera le debut des temps nouveaux.
  We fully agree in  the suppression ofthe Turkish army.  We presume that theFrench Government contemplate also the suppression of the Turkish; navy.  TheBritish, scheme aims at the control of  allTurkish Departments  of State, and there-fore of  the gendarmerie through  theMinistry of the Interior.  We agree as regards the attribution&apos;ofthe Dodecanese to Greece.    We under-stand thiat a secret agreement has alreadybeen reached between  Italy  and  Greeceon this  point.  We are in entire agreement as to thenecessity of a speedy termination of theunwarranted  Italian   occupation   ofSouthern Anatolia.   The French Govern-ment appear, however, to expect that this can be effected by specific economic; con-cessions to Italy, such  as the coal minesofHeraclea, and the Italian participation in the administration of the new State ofthe Straits.   In view of the Treaty ofLondon, we fear that greater inducementthan this will be required.   We suggestthat this might take the form, of priority of commercial enterprise in a zone offSouthern Anatolia,  as well as of partici-pation in the international control of theTurkish Government.    His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have an additional lever inthe  extent  of  the  cession  of territory which Italy desires to  obtain from themin Africa.  W;e are disposed  to accept the Frenchview in regard  to the  occupation ofCilicia.   We  await,   however,  fullerexplanation of what is understood by thewords &quot;Le maintien d&apos;une souverainetenominale d&apos;ordre spirituel sur le vilayetd&apos;Adana est admissible pour nous.&quot;  This paragraph gives rise to  serious and  complicated  considerations.   Theproblem would no doubt have been simpli-fied  if  the  Greek  occupation  of  the smyrna area had not been sanctioned bythe Supreme Council, at any rate at a date  so  long before the final  Turkishsettlement;  but  it  would  seem  that inpractice the Supreme Council is to someextent committed to  the continuance ofthe Greek occupation. At any rate thisoccupation has been prolonged for such aperiod that a Greek evacuation  at  this  L&apos;Arm6e  turque  disparaitrait  et ledesarmement  indispensable  des  Turcsconduirait a Tinstitution d&apos;une gendar-merie commandee par  des  instructeursallies.   Les  paysans turcs parmi lesquelsles  soldats etaient  recrutts par la con-trainte   seront  les  premiers  a  s&apos;enfeliciter:  1&apos;exemple  des  Mongols et desTurcs de 1&apos;Asie Centrale montre commentles peuples les plus belliqueux et les plusf6roces de meme race ont aisement evolutvers une vie  politique pacifique.  Les lies du.Dodecanese, dont les habitations-tants  sont grecs, seraient conformement aux desirs de ceux-ci et aux principesadmis  par   les  Allies,   rattachees  auRoyaume de Grece.   /occupation  italienne  d&apos;un certainnombre  de points d&apos;Asie Mineure, qui aeu lieu centre les principes et malgre lerefus  de la Conference de la reconnaitre,prendra  fin  a, plus forte raison.   Desavantages  economiques,  par  exemple,dans les charbonnages d&apos;Heraclee, pour-raient  etre  concedes  a  1&apos;Italie,  quid&apos;ailleurs fera partie du Conseil Interna-tional de 1&apos;Etat neutre de Constantinopleet des Detroits.  Une  satisfaction  serait  rechercheeegalement pour les  Turcs dans la regiond&apos;Adana,  afin d&apos;apaiser leurs susceptibilites-bilites nationales:  la France, qui  pourdes raisons strategiques ne peut renonceraux forts  du Taurus, defense historiquede la  Syrie, cherchera une  formule res-pectant la culture turque qui domine enCilicie. Le maintien d&apos;une souverainetenominale d&apos;ordre spirituel  sur le vilayetd&apos;Adana est admissible pour nous.  Quant au littoral, il semble que, memedans  1&apos;antique Ionie, il soit preferablepour  les Grecs, de  ne pas  se separer deL&apos;Asie Mineure,  qui leur off re un  largechamp d&apos;action, s&apos;ils ne provoquent pasle  nationalisme turc par une annexationqu&apos;ils ne sont sans  doute pas en  tat dedefendre  constamment par les armes.Les Grecs pourraient recevoir en Thracedans  la region d&apos;d&apos;andrinople  de largessatisfactions;  ils participeraient d&apos;ail-leurs   a 1&apos;administration  de  Constan- &apos;tinople.
stage can hardly be decided upon withoutconsidering  the  possible  political  effect,not only on the present Greek  Govern-ment but  also on the Nationalist  Move-ment  in  Turkey.    The   zone  roundSmyrna, comprising  more or  less  thepresent line  delimited as a strategicalfrontier by General Milne  but excludingAidin, may  have to be ceded to Greece.In this connection the proposal for theTurkish disarmament and Allied controlof  the  Turkish  gendarmerie  shoulddiminish the chances of a continuance ofthe present guerilla warfare on the fron-tier  of the  zone.   This cession,  could,moreover,  be  justified  as   far  as  theSanjak of Smyrna is concerned on a basisof nationality (the  Greeks being  beforethe war in a majority in the  Sanjak of smyrna),  and  the  extension  from  theSanjak to the present line  of occupationcan be justified on the ground of strategy.If this cession took place Greece would,of course, have to sign a treaty containingstringent stipulations regarding freedomof commerce and transit via, Smyrna,  and fully protecting minority rights.  On the other hand, the Smyrna  regionis important  as an economic outlet toAnatolia.  If, therefore, it be decided, aswe propose,  that European Turkey up tothe Enos-Midia line should be  ceded to greece, it should be possible to arrange with M. Veniselos  a compromise some-what as follows :   Smyrna should be left under  nominalTurkish sovereignty with  a vali  chosenwith the consent of the Powers and  acting in council.   The latter would be composedof the representatives of  the principal allied (and Associated) Powers,  with,however,  adequate   and   proportional representation of local  interests  (both.Greek and Turkish).  This would  reduceTurkish  sovereignty  to   an  agreeablefiction, and, at the same  time, provideproper safeguards  for  the non-Turkishelements.  A further grave question is raised bothin the French Memorandum and  by theBritish  proposals, i.e., the  future ofAdrianople.   It is clear that if (a) the Turk is to beexpelled from Europe, (b)  the new inter-national State  is  limited by the Enos-Midia line (and this we consider to be theonly practical course),  Adrianople mustbe either Greek or Bulgarian.   Ethnologically, the latter solution haslittle  to  recommend  it,  the  Moslemelement in so far as it is non-Turk beingPomak and non-Bulgarian, whije,  politi-
cally, objection may well be felt againstso rewarding an enemy State.  Ethnologically,  the  Greeks  have  abetter claim.  If, however, they obtain itas some sort of compensation or induce-ment for the evacuation of Smyrna, it isproposed that the system of the vali incouncil, suggested above for the Smyrnaarea,  should   be   applied,   Mutatis Mutandis, to the  Adrianople  area.   Inthis  case the majority of the council, ofthe Greek Governor would be Moslem.  We  are  in general  agreement: Therights of non-Turkish elements might be safeguarded by a special treaty for theprotection of minorities on the lines ofthose already negotiated with the smallerEuropean Powers. The effective workingof these provisions would be.part  of theduty of the Allied advisers of the TurkishGovernment.  This minority treaty, likethe  other minority treaties,  would  beplaced under the aegis  of the League ofNations.  It might even be possible tostipulate in the Treaty that the Leagueof Nations, which is  understood to bealready regarded by  Turkish  eyes  assomething holy and magnificent,  shouldhaye power  to disallow  legislation  whichis reported  by  the  Allied adviser  oradvisers  in  control  of  the  TurkishDepartment initiating  the legislation tobe   directed  against  the   legitimateinterests of any minorities of the popula-tion.  We wish to make no comments on the observations  contained in  the first  fiveparagraphs of the Armenian part of theFrench   memorandum   regarding   thegeography  and  population   of   the armenian territories, with which, exceptfor a point of detail dealt with below, weare ,in  general agreement,  and whichcoincides roughly with a proposal alreadyworked ^  out  by   the  British PeaceDelegation.

  We think that the present Armenianpopulation of  the Caucasus and Turkeymay be under-estimated  in  this  para-graph, and in any case it is probable thatin the vilayets of Van,  Bitlis, Erzerum,Marmaret-el-Aziz and Diarbekir, owingto famine, epidemics and the successivewaves  of  invasion  and  retreat,  theTurkish and Kurdish inhabitants have probably  suffered   losses  approachingthose of the  Armenians.  Further  the armenian is more prolific than the Turk,or Kurd.  We  sympathise  with the  desire  to incorporate  in  the Armenian  State  ofErivan as much as possible of the dis-tricts disputed  with Georgia  (Borchali)and  with  Azerbaijan  (Karabagh  andZangezur).  The Armenian population,which  is to form  the new State, is too small for us to  disregard any possibilityof   including    territory   essentiallyinhabited  by Armenians in its frontiers.  But, while  the final  frontiers mustnecessarily  be  drawn   by  an  expertAllied Commission, we  feel  it right tosay a word of warning as to the difficultyof attaching to  Armenia the Karabagharea.  This  is not because it  does not initself contain a large Armenian majority,but  because  it  forms a kind of rockypeninsula in Tartar and Kurdish country,which it might  be  difficult for  the armenian   State  to   defend  againstAzerbaijan.  We  agree generally  with   the  limitsproposed for that part of present Turkishterritory  which  is to  be attached  tostantinoole  que s&apos;orientait  le trafic deleurs vailees et leur besoin le plus urgentserait de construire la ligne cTErzerounia Angora, branche Nord du chemin de ferde  Bagdad  arretee * par le veto de  laRussie.

                       Second Meeting:  Turkish Settlement.    The meeting opened at  3 o&apos;clock in the Secretary of State&apos;s  room at, the ForeignOffice; the same representatives were present.Financial Administration of the State of Constantinople and the Straits.    Mr. Yansittart explained, that a possible solution  of the difficulty of establishing anew administration for  Constantinople  and the Straits, and a new and more compre-hensive Allied control over  Turkey proper, could be  met by the same administrationrunning both the Straits zone and the Government of Turkey in Asia.  He was not infavour of this for political reasons, but for financial reasons Mr. Armitage Smith wishedto explain the solution, even if it was decided to reject it.    Mr. Armitage Smith then  explained how complicated he thought the international machinery both for the new State  and for Turkey in Asia would be.  He believed inany case that Constantinople and the Straits would start practically bankrupt, and therest of Turkey was nearly in the same position.    M. Berthelot disagreed.  It was illogical to keep the Turkish Government in any form, even its financial Departments, at Constantinople.  Each State should live as faras possible on its own resources, and be quite&apos; separate.   For  the rest, the French didnot contemplate any very extensive or  expensive  Allied control for the Government ofTurkey in Asia;  financial  supervision and the  control over the gendarmerie were thetwo essentials ; the rest of the control might be light.    Lord Curzon said that  he  agreed  generally with M.  Berthelot.   The functions  ofthe new State of Constantinople and the Straits and  of the Government of Turkey in asia  respectively were  quite  different;  the distinction between  them  should be complete.   The one  was to  be  an area taken  from the Turk  and  governed by aninternational body.  The  other was to be an  area left  under the sovereignty  of the turk, but subject in certain respects to international supervision.  Moreover, he saw noreason for accepting the hypothesis on  which Mr. Armitage Smith&apos;s  argument rested,viz., the bankruptcy of the new State.     Mr. Armitage Smith explained that his view regarding the financial bankruptcy  ofthe new State was based on the lack of means of  production in Constantinople, and the chaos likely to result from the exodus of the administrative staffs of the old TurkishGovernment and their dependents ; he did not  see whence the revenue was to come.     Lord Curzon thought  the  financial position of the Suez Canal administration andthe method by which  it  obtained large  revenues by shipping dues offered certainanalogies.     Mr.  Yansittart  and  Mr.  Forbes  Adam explained that  they had  examined thequestion of the  revenue-producing  resources  of the new State; there  were understood to he within the boundaries of the  new State coal, oil, and iron concessions; there weremarble quarries  of value in the Island  of Marmora;  market  gardening, which had already showed  its possibilities, and fisheries  could much  be  developed ;  the port could he made more attractive for shipping, was the  natural centre  for a large transit  trade,. and could be developed as a bunkering depot;  it  had always been contemplated that a considerable revenue could be obtained from shipping dues as Lord Curzon suggested.     Some discussion then took place as to the population of the  zone, and whether for administrative reasons the Chatalja line should be substituted for the Enos-Midia.     It was thought that  for working  purposes the population of the zone within the Enos-Midia line and  the reserved area on the  Asiatic side  of  the  Straits might  be regarded as about one and a half million.     M. Berthelot was entirely in favour of the Enos-Midia line; he thought European administration,  honestly and efficiently run  as it would be, might enormously develop the resources of the zone; he agreed with Lord Curzon as to the Suez Canal analogy.     It was then agreed that the question of the  population and financial resources of the new State might be examined in detail later on by an expert Commission.     Lord Curzon asked  M.  Berthelot what  were  his views as regards the number of Departments  required  for the administration of  the  new  State.   M.  Berthelot replied that, while he would like to postpone  till  his return  to Paris the elaboration of a detailed scheme, he personally thought that it would be  possible to  cut down the^
number of Departments  named  in  the  British observations on the  French note toperhaps four, say, finance, commerce  and  industry, internal affairs and external affairs,grouping under these the  other Departments  suggested in the British scheme.Question of the Property (a) of the Turkish  Government  of  the  Sultan and (b) of    Turkish Private Property in  Constantinople and the new State.    In answer to an enquiry from Lord Curzon, M. Berthelot explained that he thoughtall secular State property  (including that of the Sultan)  should be ceded  to the  new state under the Treaty, but the Treaty would lay down that  all places of religiousveneration and property held under Wakf, &amp;c,  would be respected  by the Governmentof the new State.    On the other hand, Mr. Armitage Smith enquired whether  it would  be right  thus to hand over to the new State Turkish public property, which represented one of the assets of the Allies for the  payment of  the  latter&apos;s just claims against the TurkishGovernment.    M. Berthelot suggested that  the Reparation Commission would be the proper body to whom this question should be referred for a decision.    It was generally agreed that the Imperial and State domains misfit be taken inliquidation of some at any rate of the claims to be made against the Turkish Govern-ment in the Peace Treaty.    It was also agreed that the question of  the  private property  of  Turkish  citizensmight be dealt with  on the principles adopted with regard to the peace settlement for germany, Austria, and  Hungary. According  to accepted principles, the  residents inthe new State would have to decide whether they would become  citizens in the  new state or emigrate;  in the latter  case they would be allowed to take  their moveableproperty with them  and realise their immoveable property on equitable terms.Defence.     Lord Curzon raised the question of the  army and navy, and  gendarmerie in  thenew State.  M. Berthelot said that he thought only a small Allied military force, a fewpolice boats, and  a gendarmerie would be  required.   For  the Allied forces,  Moslemsoldiers could be found both in France and the  British Empire.     It was generally agreed that in  the  last  resort the  new  State  would have to rely on the British and French fleets  and armies for  defence in the case of a menace of serious aggression, until  of course, the  sanctions, provided  or to  be provided by theLeague of Nations, became  really effective.      Mr,  Vansittart also  pointed  out  that the European land  frontier  would becoterminous with that of Greece  if the present general  proposals  regarding EuropeanTurkey were adopted, and that no danger  was to be feared from this quarter, Greecereally being at the mercy of the French and British fleets.Question of Popular Control over the Government in the new  State.      M. de Fleuriau suggested that the  present local organs of Government might becontinued.      Lord Curzon pointed out that this was not sufficient, as the population in this areabefore the creation of the new State would have benefited by the  Turkish constitution and  the  right to  elect members  for  a  legislative  Assembly.   It  was  agreed  on M. Berthelot&apos;s  suggestion  that  the principle of legislative representation  should be accepted and  the details worked out later by  the International Commission, as suggested in the British observations on  the French  note.  The  League  of Nations might participate in this matter. Turkey in Asia.  Capital of the New Turkish State.      A brief  discussion  took place  as to the most  suitable town in which the new Turkish Government in Asia should be  established.   M. Berthelot  favoured Konia; Brusa was too close to the new State and Constantinople.  Aspirations for the recovery of Constantinople might thus be kept alive in Turkey.      Lord Curzon thought that the Turks  if left to themselves would probably choose Brusa, although  both  Brusa and   Konia  had  been  Turkish capitals  in  the  past. Brusa had stronger traditions, contained  important mosques, and it would be easier  to transfer administration from  Constantinople  to a town as  close  as  Brusa,  which was
 already connected with Mudania on the Sea of Marmora by railway.   There was  also much to be said for having the new Turkish Government at a place where it could be more easily overawed in case of necessity by the Allies.     M. de Fleuriau said that there was much  to  be said for and against each  place. Konia too had a history behind it, and it was a  place of religious importance;  important notables such as the Tchelebi of the Dervishes  lived there. League of  Nations.     At this point Lord Curzon was called away from the  meeting, and, as previously arranged, a discussion then took place on a suggestion of Lord  Curzon&apos;s that a formula should be drafted outlining the part which the League of Nations might play in relation to the new State of Constantinople  and  the Straiks.     The following formula was agreed upon as a result of the subsequent discussion :          &quot; 1.  Le nouvel  tat sera, d&apos;une maniere genirale, place&quot; sous la haute  protection     de la Societe&quot; des Nations.         &quot; 2.  II recevra, dans le delai et la forme compatibles avec l&apos;organisation de son     administration,  des institutions electives placees sous la  garantie de la Societe- des     Nations.         &quot;3.  Dans le cas d&apos;un dissentiment  persistant entre les membres de la  Corn-     mission du Gouvernement, la question en  litige pourra etre, par un vote des deux     tiers des deleguds, portee pour  decision devant le Conseil de la  Societe des Nations.&quot;     The words &quot; sous la garantie de la Societe&quot; des  Nations &quot; in the second paragraph ofthe formula were adopted on the proposal of M. de Fleuriau, who explained that it  hadalready been  applied in the  case  of Danzig.   He understood that  the words were intended to give the League of Nations the  power to have the constitution of the new state submitted to it for approval, and that  no  modification of the  constitution could belater effected without the League&apos;s  assent.Capitulations.     It was agreed that, while two different  judicial  systems would be required for thenew State respectively,  and  for Turkey  in Asia (International Courts in the  new Stateand something more closely resembling the Capitulations in Turkey), the precise systemsto be adopted in both cases should  form the subject of a study on the spot  by expertCommissions to be appointed under  the  Treaty, as  suggested in  the British observations on the French note.Financial Control  over the Turkish  Government in Asia.     Mr. Armitage Smith explained that in his discussions with the head of the FrenchMinistry of Finance in Paris, M. Sergent, almost complete agreement had been reached as to what  was required.     There  would be a  small revised body  representing the Pre-War Debt Council,which would remain for a time at  Constantinople paying  coupons  and receiving  themonies paid to it as provided for in  detail in the Treaty.   At Konia there would be a financial Commission with large powers, and an extensive control on which only GreatBritain, France, Italy, and possibly  the  United  States (and possibly later Russia) wouldbe represented.     The large staff working before the war under the Debt Council all over the  turkish empire and collecting the assigned  revenues could  now be put, with all its  experience and efficiency, at the disposal of the  Financial Commission.  All  the new machinery would not therefore have to be created afresh and the Turkish Government were alreadyused to this large measure of European  interference and control.     M. Berthelot said that he would  agree in principle to  the British suggestions onthis head, but proposed  that in any case  the  Currency Board which was one of thethree financial controls suggested in  the British observations,  could be suppressed ormade a sub-commission of the Financial Commission.     This latter proposal was accepted.     It was also agreed that, as soon as possible, the  detailed British financial proposalswhich  would  take  the form   of  articles  for insertion  in  the  Treaty  should becommunicated to the French Government for their examination.
    Army and Navy.        There was general agreement that both the Turkish  Army and Navy should be    suppressed and the gendarmerie placed under Allied control, on which the  same Great    Powers would, be represented as on the Financial Commission.   The question of the Dodecanese.        It was  agreed that these should be returned to Greece.   Owing to the secret    agreement between Italy and Greece,  of which the French and British Governments    were aware, no difficulty on this score  was now apprehended from Italy.    Italian evacuation of Southern Anatolia.        M.  Berthelot  agreed  that  while the  French  proposal to  give  the Italian  a  .  predominance in the control of the coal mines  at A&amp;mimlm might  stand, it would not    be enough to  induce the Italians to evacuate  Southern Anatolia, and that  something    like the British proposal to give  the Italians a  sphere  of  economic priority in the    matter of future concessions in Southern Anatolia would be necessary.        It was also agreed that the Italians, if they  secured control over  the mines of/aJ Her^clea, would have to agree  to continue  to  supply  Constantinople with coal as has  / been done up to now.        M. Berthelot here referred to the  mention in  the  British observations  of British    cessions to Italy in  Africa.        Mr. Vansittart explained the present position as regards  these concessions both in    Jubaland and  on  the  Western Frontier  of  Egypt,  and pointed  out  (in  reply to   M. Berthelot&apos;s contention that Italy had not  in practice merited any very favourable   treatment in this matter) that  Italy stood by the  Treaty  of  London in  this respect;   that we  had  done  our&apos; best to satisfy her,^but  that, unfortunately, France had  not   found herself able to make an equal contribution.   cilicia.        Mr. Vansittart explained that we  were afraid that the  French proposal to maintain   nominal  Turkish sovereignty of a spiritual order over the vilayet of Adana might be   intended to recognise past  Turkish pretensions to the  continuance  of  some  kind of   spiritual  sovereignty in  ceded  territory by  insisting  on the right to  nominate such   functionaries  as naibs and  kadis.  He cited the  unfortunate  case  of  the Treaty of   Lausanne, where Italy had acknowledged some  such right.        M. Berthelot agreed that this was a  danger, and  that he would  drop the proposal   as regards the  words  &quot;spiritual order.&quot;   Later during the  meeting, in reply to an   enquiry from Lord  Curzon,  he  explained  that  the  French  expected  really to obtain a   position  in Cilicia under some form of nominal Turkish  sovereignty.   They  had not   worke$l out the details of their  scheme, but would do so and communicate them to His   Majesty&apos;s Government later.  He also informed Lord Curzon that they intended to offer   a home and protection in Cilicia for those Armenians who wished to settle there.   Armenia.       M.  Berthelot agreed generally with  all the  British  proposals on the Armenian   portion of the French memorandum, and as to the inclusion of Erzeroum in the Armenian   State.  He suggested that  the actual frontiers should be  decided by an  expert Allied   Commission later.       As  regards military assistance to  the, new  Armenian State,  M. Berthelot com-   municated a report from  the head of  the French  Military Mission  in the Caucasus,   Colonel Chardigny,  as to the number of Allied troops required to assist the Armenians   both in the Caucasus and in Turkey in establishing the frontiers of their new State.   This report is attached as an appendix to this minute.       It was agreed that this might suitably form the basis for  an  enquiry by an Allied   Military Mission later.       He also agreed that the British suggestion  as to confiding to the Council  of the   League of Nations the task of helping Armenia with men and money might  well be   adopted, if the French, British, ana Italian Governments found later, after examination   by experts, that they could not supply the necessary resources alone.   Batoum.       M. Berthelot agreed with the British  proposal  that a  special free State might be   created around Batoum under the aegis of the League of Nations, Batoum being a free         [1845]                      &quot;            &apos;                         D
port.   The details of the scheme  could  be worked out  later on by a  special AlliedCommissionSmyrna Area.    Some discussion followed as to the question  of keeping the Greeks in Smyrna.M. Berthelot explained that M. Veniselos had spoken  rather strongly to him about thenecessity of the Greeks being allowed, to  keep  Smyrna, but had hinted that in certain eventualities he might accept a Greek withdrawal.    M. Berthelot fully concurred with  the proposals in the British  note that if, as theFrench desired, the Greeks withdrew, some special regime would have to be establishedwhich  would save their amour-propre and  safeguard the interests of the large Greekpopulation  in this area.    It was suggested in  the course of subsequent discussion that Smyrna would have -to be made a free port; that while nominal Turkish sovereignty remained over Smyrnaand the area around it the Greeks might secure some form of preponderant representa-tion in the  local Government, that  the Allied controls over the Central Departments ofthe Turkish  Government should  secure  that  Greek inspectors, &amp;c, were  appointedlocally, and  that  in  any case the  Greek evacuation would  have  to  be carried outgradually, and an Allied Commission of Officers would have to remain on the spot for acertain time after the evacuation to guard  against a policy of retaliation by the Turks.    At this point Lord Curzon returned  to  the meeting.   The proceedings which hadtaken  place in  his absence were explained to him, and he  approved the terms quoted above for the formula for the  League of Nations  in connection with the new State ofConstantinople  and the Straits.Financial Control over the Government of  Turkey  in Asia.    With regard to the question of  financial control over the Government of turkey in Asia, Lord Curzon enquired whether it was  intended  to  place all  the revenues or only some of them  under the Financial Commission.   Mr. Armitage Smith  explainedthat it was essential in order not only to secure  the Allies just demands for reparationbut also to restore some semblance of commercial prosperity in Turkey, that  all the revenues should be placed under Allied control.    Lord   Curzon expressed the  fear  that if a Financial Commission with theseextensive  powers was set up, and  if, as he understood, the Financial Commission were pratically  to impose every year a  budget  which the Legislative Assembly would  haveto accept, not only the Turks, but  many people outside Turkey, and in  particular the moslem world,  would  say  that the Allies  were, in fact, destroying an independentTurkish Government,  and  any possibility of democratic  development in  Turkey,however unlikely such a development might be in practice.  He did not think these objections would be overcome by saying, as M.  Berthelot and Mr. Armitage Smith had said, that such  a strict  regime of Allied control was really vitally necessary to Turkey,and would  therefore be welcomed by all thinking Turks.    Lord Curzon finally asked whether it would  not  be possible to lay down in theTreaty that the financial control should only continue until the pre-war debt obligations of Turkey  had  been liquidated, and that then the Council of the  League of Nationsmight  be consulted as to the regime which was to take  the place, of  the previous Alliedfinancial control.    M. Berthelot thought this an  excellent  suggestion, and it was generally agreed to.    The decisions which had  been  reached in Lord  Curzon&apos;s absence  regarding thecapitulations, the Dodecanese,  Cilicia,  Armenia,  and  Batoum were   explained  toLord Curzon, who agreed with them.Railways,    The French representative had no proposal to  make on the question of railways,but Lord Curzon suggested that it was essential to provide in the Treaty for some formof international board (French, English,  and  Italian) to control the running of therailways as part of the  general scheme  for the economic rehabilitation - of Turkey.Mr. Armitage  Smith suggested that  the Board might take  the  form of  a special commission of one of the  controlled Central Departments, possibly a special commissionof the  Financial  Commission.  Lord Curzon  also pointed  out  that some  agreement should be reached between the  French and British Governments  as to the German&apos;
shares in the Anatolia and Bagdad railways ;  the other existing railways in the newTurkey in  Asia  being already either   British (Smyrna-Aidin  Railway) or French(Smyrna-Cassaba).     Mr. Armitage Smith  explained  that, as regards concessions,  a  distinction  wouldhave to be made between existing concessions  and future concessions; he thought thatthe grant of future concessions should in  some way be placed under the control of theFinancial  Commission, as  it  was a  matter whioh essentially  concerned  the  economic prosperity of Turkey.   As regards past concessions, a clause had already been drawn upby the British Delegation  in Paris and might be discussed with the French.     Lord Curzon reverted to the question of the proposal to give Italy a priority in thegrant  of  new concessions in Southern&apos; Anatolia, and  asked whether it was intendedmerely to  give Italy a  priority as against France&apos;and  Great Britain  or  a completemonopoly, all other Powers agreeing to  abstain from working for  or undertaking  any concessions in the Italian zone.   It was agreed that the former was meant.     As regards railways and  concessions generally, it was agreed that general proposals should  be drawn up  by  the  British  Government  and  submitted  to the  FrenchGovernment in due course.Smyrna.     The  question of the form of Government in this area in the event  of  Greekwithdrawal was then discussed again.     Lord  Curzon said  that  it was essential that  M. Veniselos should be  informed of details of the proposed regime which  was to follow in this area if the Greeks withdrew.Otherwise after having committed himself, as he had done,  he might find it difficult towithdraw in the face of Greek  public opinion.  Lord Curzon suggested  the possibilityof a local Greek Commission  at Smyrna looking after the port and town under a Greekchairman.     As the  question  of  Greek  withdrawal  was closely bound  up with the  Greekacquisition of Turkey in Europe north of the Enos-Midia line, the question of the futureof Smyrna was really closely connected with  the future  regime  at Adrianople.  lord curzon pointed  out the danger of  taking  this town  with its past associations  andtraditions from the Turks unless their interests were to be safeguarded.   If Adrianoplewere handed over to the Greeks, it should be stated in the Treaty  that the Mosqueswere in any case to be respected.  M. Berthelot entirely concurred, and  it  was agreedthat some formula should be found setting up a regime at Smyrna which might apply,mutatis mutandis, to the area around Adrianople.   For the former, Greek interests would be specially safeguarded (the possibility of the Governor of the sanjak or vilayetbeing always a Greek  on  the  analogy of the Lebanon was suggested  by Mr. ForbesAdam).  For the latter, Turkish interests would be similarly  safeguarded, and  theGovernor  of the Adrianople area might always be a Turk.     Before terminating the discussion, Lord Curzon said that on  the assumption that something like the present proposals  for  peace  terms with Turkey were accepted bythe other  Allies, he hoped that  the  military difficulties of imposing them  on turkey would not be ignored.    It  would be disastrous to dictate a peace which the Allies  hadnot the military strength to enforce.     M. Berthelot said that he himself thought that the Nationalist movement  headed by Mustapha Kemal was largely bluff, and that a  show of force from the points where 3 Allies  had troops would be sufficient to show this.     Lord  Curzon was not so optimistic, but  he agreed that a way  could be found of imposing these conditions if the Allies were united and determined upon  it.            (The meeting then closed  and  it was agreed to renew discussions                             at 11*30 on the next day.)
MEMORANDUM BY  COLONEL CHARDIGNY,  HEAD or FRENCH MILITARY MISSION                             IN THE  CAUCASUS.           Quelles sont les Conditions necessaires pour creer cette Armenie ?   1 I/EXPOSE  qui precede  suffit a lui seul a faire  comprendre  les difficultes quepresente la creation d&apos;une  Armenie unie  dont une des parties, l&apos;Arme&quot;nie turque, n&apos;estplus aujourd&apos;hui qu&apos;une simple conception  theorique.    En Armenie  russe 1&apos;element armenien ife forme presque nulle part un tout compact,vit melange a 1&apos;element tatare ou kurde, qui lui est hostile  et doit etre protege contrelui.  Les  evenements  de cet 6t6 a Nakitchevan ont, en eftet, montre que, reduite a sespropres forces,  la Republique armenienne n&apos;etait pas capable de maintenir  sous sonadministration les regions musulmanes qu&apos;elle pretend gouverner.    En Armenie  turque T element armenien n&apos;existe plus, il faut l&apos;y ramener des quatrecoins de la Turquie, ly defendre contre une  population hostile kurdo-turque qui s&apos;estpartage les terres et qui, par la voix de ses chefs, de Mustapha Kemal  Pacha, a declareau mois de juillet dernier, au  Congres  d&apos;Erzeroum, &quot; quelle etait decidee a ne pas cederaux Armeniens un pouce de terrain des six vilayets, et qu&apos;elle dtait pr t a defendre sesdroits par la force des armes.&quot;    II faut, en outre, pendant deux annees assurer le  ravitaillement complet de cettepopulation dont les villages sont mines.

                         Third Meeting: Turkish, Settlement,     The Anglo-French discussion was  continued  at a meeting at 11*30 A.M., the 23rd December, in the Secretary of State&apos;s room at the Foreign Office.     The same representatives were  present as oh the 22nd December, but Lieutenant- Colonel  Gribbon also attended on behalf of the War Office. Kurdistan.    . Lord Curzon opened the meeting by referring to M. Berthelotfs note on  Kurdistan which he had just received and glanced at.   The  note proposed that part of  Kurdistan should fall within the British Mesopotamian mandate, but that the rest might be formed into a federation of Kurdish tribes under some form of loose Anglo-French control, but with the maintenance in theory of Turkish sovereignty.     Lord  Curzon  said that  he was doubtful regarding  the  advisability of an  even nominal sovereignty of the Sultan in Kurdistan.  Nor did he like the  idea of dividing it into  spheres of control.  M.  Berthelot replied that the tribal divisions made for disunity.  But Lord Curzon explained  that this was not quite what he meant.   It was the idea of  a division between France and Great Britain of the Kurdish area that he disliked.  He did not think the Kurds would  relish it.   Lord Curzon said that it was difficult  to  cover the ground in an exchange of notes or to decide the boundaries of Kurdistan apart from a decision as to the boundaries of the Mosul vilayet and Southern Kurdistan.   He ventured, however,  to suggest to M.  Berthelot the following outlines of general policy which might guide the British and French Governments in coming to a final decision:      1. No  mandate,  whether English  or French,  or  Anglo-French,  w7as possible or            desirable for  Kurdistan  as a whole, except perhaps for  the more settled            areas in Southern Kurdistan.     2. Turkish rule, for obvious  reasons which past experience made  clear, should not            continue in Kurdistan in even a nominal  form.     3. The Kurds were quite capable of making (and according to his latest information            were disposed to  make) a working arrangement with the Assyrians on one            side and the Armenians  on the other.  The  Kurdistan  question  could not            therefore be  considered apart from the formation of the Armenian State on            which the French  and British were agreed.     4. Lord Curzon&apos;s own idea was to allow the Kurds to decide whether they would            form a single State or a number of small  loosely knit areas.  Time and non-            interference by the Turks could alone show what they were capable of.     5. The  Kurds should,  if possible, be guaranteed  against Turkish aggression, but           should  preferably not  have formally appointed advisers, whether French or           British.     6. Both from the British and French points  of view it was undesirable to create  a           frontier  problem  similar to that with which  the British were confronted in           India.    M.  Berthelot said that  he  agreed with these  general propositions, and with  aproposal  subsequently made by Lord Curzon that it would be best to leave the question for the present, and perhaps return to it after a discussion on Mosul and other pointsregarding the Arab countries.Georgia,  Azerbaijan and Daghestan.    M. Berthelot raised  the  question  of the  Allied attitude towards the  CaucasianStates.   Lord Curzon reviewed the position briefly as follows:     1.  It had been agreed upon at yesterdays meeting that Batoum and the area round           it  might be made a small free State  under  the League of Nations with  a          free port. ,r   2.  Great Britain was more closely interested than any  of the Allied Powers in the          present and future of these Caucasian States because of her  position in Asia,          the recent occupation of the country by her troops,  and the presence of her          consular officers.
     3. The present British policy  was to  protect  these  States  on the  north from           aggression  by Denikin, but Great Britain  had not so far  recognised  the           de facto or de jure sovereignty of any of them, because  of the assumption           of responsibilities which wmild be involved.     4. Great Britain would prefer to act in concert with the Allies if there was to be           any change of policy in this respect.     5. For the present it was desirable to wait and see what would happen to Denikin           in Southern Russia.   1  6. Lord  Curzon personally desired  to see these  States  enjoy an  autonomous           existence with close union and co-operation among them,  and possibly a           federal association at a later date with a united Russia, if such were ever           reconstituted.     7. If anything catastrophic happened during the winter, the Allies might consider           the recognition of Georgia and, Azerbaijan next spring.  Daghestan  was in,           rather a different position, being within the  Denikin sphere.     8. It was clear that neither America, France, Italy nor Great Britain was prepared           to take a mandate in the Caucasus.     M. Berthelot  agreed  generally  with  these propositions.   France was interested commercially and as regards oil in the Caucasus.     Lord  Curzon added that, on a  point of detail, it  might be desirable to  detach Lazistan,  roughly represented by the present sanjak,  from Turkey and attach it to Georgia, as  the Lazes, although Moslems,  were, of Georgian race and sentiment  and spoke Georgian dialects.   Georgian territory might be brought down between the  free-State of Batoum and Armenia, and joined on to Lazistan.   The status of Georgia would not be defined at present, however, or necessarily in connection with the Turkish Treaty.     On  the  other hand,  the policy already agreed  upon would  involve the early recognition of the new Armenia, within the general boundaries decided upon yesterday, as an independent State by the terms of the Treaty with Turkey.   The question of Armenia would thus be treated differently from that of Georgia and Azerbaijan.     M. Berthelot agreed generally with these views.     Lord Curzon  then reverted to the question which had been discussed yesterday of the  financial and  military assistance  to be given to the  new Armenian State.  He  said that  he thought  large  sums of money would probably come  from  America.   The Armenian  troops were capable fighters and as fierce as the Turks.   A force would be required of  some five to  ten thousand men, which might be raised  internationally. Colonel Chardigny&apos;s estimate of twenty thousand men seemed to him too high.   The international force might stay in the Armenian State for a period of, say, five years, and then retire if the situation  so permitted, or be  renewed by the League of Nations.     M. Bertheiot said that he thought that Lord Curzon  had admirably sketched the details of the manner in  w hich Armenia might be internationally established. Arab Countries.     Lord Curzon  then suggested that a discussion on the second part of M. Berthelots note  of the  12th December regarding the Arabian countries  (see Appendix  to  this Minute) might well now be undertaken.  The subject seemed naturally to fall into the four following questions :      1. Mosul and  oil.     2.  Frontiers of Palestine.     3.  British railway from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia, and     4.  Arabia.      M. Berthelot agreed, and began by explaining that M. Clemenceau had promised Mr. Lloyd George last December that he would not claim  Mosul, although it fell in the French Arab  zone under the  Sykes-Picot  agreement, provided, however,  that  the French reached a satisfactory agreement regarding the oil in this area, and that they were satisfied with regard to  their Syrian mandate.      The discussion then turned on the question of oil, and Lord Curzon recalled  how the temporary agreement made between Senator Berenger and Mr. Long  last summer had been  dropped, owing to a difference  of opinion between the Prime  Minister and M. Clemenceau.   He  understood however  that, as a result of M. Clemenceau&apos;s recent conversations with Mr. Lloyd George, negotiations had   been  reopened between Sir John Cadman and M. Berenger with the result that an agreement had been reached, of
which he did not yet know the details, but which was understood to give the French a25 per cent, share in the capital of the company which was to work these oilfields.    Lord Curzon  believed  that the  agreement had been  accepted by  the PrimeMinister.                                  x    M. Berthelot said, however,  that it had still to be accepted by M.  Clemenceau, andhe added rhat M.  Bdrenger had only acted as an oil expert and had not been competent to regard the question from a political point of view.    M. Berthelot also explained that  a  difficult legal question  was  raised as to theGerman shares in the Turkish  Petroleum  Company, which represented the portionwhich was to fall to the French.   He agreed, however, with Lord Curzon  that this was an expert question on which Sir  John Caclman and M. Berenger had doubtless satisfied themselves.    At this stage M.  Berthelot said that he wished to make clear that he thought that neither side had quite understood the true purport  of the Long-Berenger Agreementwhen  it was dropped last summer.   The British seemed to think that it gave advantages to the French only, and the French vice versa.   It was really riot the French Govern-ment, however, who were responsible for dropping the agreement.  M. Berthelot also made a reference to the difficulties  of the French  oil position, especially as a result ofthe unfortunate cutting of the pipe-lines between Baku and Batoum, and of the way inwhich Americans had  forced up the price of oil in that part of the world.  He thought,however, that these difficulties were being overcome    Finally, M. Berthelot explained that before M. Berenger had come over this time,M. Clemenceau had instructed  him  to  claim 50 per cent, of the ownership of the  oilfields  in the Mosul area and Southern Kurdistan for political reasons.   M. Berthelothad replied that this was impossible.  The question  must be treated  concretely.  for technical reasons connected with the formation of the working company, 25  per cent, ofthe capital was the most  they could hope for.  M.  Clemenceau had then  said that theFrench ought to be given compensation in the matter of oil elsewhere,  e.g., in Romania.    Lord Curzon said that to him, personally, the revised agreement seemed fair.   he added  that M. Berenger  on coming to&apos;  London had explained to him  that it wasimpossible to reconstruct  the company on the basis of a 50 per cent,  share for France.He hoped, however, that the agreement which appeared to have been  reached between.  Berenger  and  Sir  John  Cadman would  prove acceptable to M.  Clemenceau andsettle the matter.    M. Berthelot agreed with this, and thought M. Clemenceau&apos;s acceptance probable.Frontier Mosul Vilayet.    Mr. Vansittart suggested  that as the French  had made  the question  of Mosuldependent  on a satisfactory settlement in Syria as well as on oil, it  might be well todiscuss the Syrian question first and return to the Mosul frontier.    M. Berthelot agreed to this  method of procedure.    He thought the question of Mosul and oil was practically settled.Emir Feisal.    M. Berthelot explained that he was in communication with the Emir in Paris.  Hehad impressed on the Emir the necessity  of  dealing loyally  with  the French if asatisfactory arrangement was to  be made.   Feisal had, at first, made a good impression on M. Berthelot.   Since  then,  however, he appeared to  have begun  bargaining  on certain points in a manner which disappointed M. Berthelot.   However, Feisal had told M. Berthelot,  before the latter&apos;s departure from Paris, that  on his return an agreement would certainly be reached.Palestine Frontiers.    The discussion then turned to the question of the Palestine frontiers.  M.  Berthelotbegan by explaining the French  point of view.  M. Clemenceau took  his  stand on theline (from  a point just north of Acre, through the north end  of the  Sea of Galileeto a  point south of  Deraa) laid  down by  the  Sykes-Picot Agreement  of 1916.M. Clemenceau had consented on certain conditions to the cession of the  Mosul area,and to  the grant  of a mandate  to Great Britain for the State of Palestine, although.internationalised under the above agreement.    He was now further prepared to agree that 33 per cent, of the  water-power of the waters flowing from Mount Hermon southwards  into the Palestine of the  Sykes-Picot
Agreement  should  be allotted to the. Zionists  under an. economic arrangement with france.  The French could not do no more than this.     Mr. Vansittart and Colonel Gribbon  explained that it was essential for economic reasons, and  if the policy of the National Home was to be effectively carried out, thatthe streams flowing south from the Herinon into the  Jordan basin, and a bit of theLitani, should fall within the Palestine territory.     The expenditure of much money and large operations of a technical nature, both ofwhich  the  Zionists alone were likely to undertake, were required for  the full  use  ofthese waters.     A map showing the northern and eastern frontiers of Palestine, as recommended bythe Chief Political Officer at Cairo, was then shown to the French.     Mr. Vansittart explained that  this represented more or less the ideal frontier froman  economic  and Zionist  point of , view,  and  might not  be  capable, of completeattainment.  He proposed accordingly, as a compromise, that  it might be modified by aline  from a point north of Acre, including the Litani bend  towards the west,  thenceacross to Mount Herrhon well to the south of Hasbeya, and thence southwards betweenthe Jordan valley and the Hedjaz railway to the old Sykes-Picot  line.   M. Berthelotstated that he was not in a position to accept this.  :   Lord Curzon said that  he could not understand  why  the French Governmentinsisted on the Sykes-Picot line, even in places where it had  been drawn regardless ofpolitical, geographical, or economic  facts.   The Prime  Minister had spoken publicly ofthe Palestine of the future as  comprising the territory  from  ancient  Dan (representedmore or less by Banias) to Beersheba, and he felt sure that he was not prepared to give way on this point     M. Berthelot said that he was  equally sure  that M. Clemenceau was not preparedto yield.  They  wanted the Sykes-Picot line, also, because the country to the north ofit included the rich Kaza of safe and, east of the Jordan, the waters  of the Yarmukvalley and the Jebel Druz area.   He believed that there were at least three differentregions inhabited at different times  by the tribe of Dan,  according to the Old Testament.M.  Clemenceau  thought  that he  had  already made  a great  cession in respect  ofPalestine.     Lord Curzon pointed out that the British acceptance of a mandate for the Zionistscould hardly  be regarded as a cession on the part of France, who was probably only tooglad to be quit of the responsibility,  and that  the French  must  remember that the zionists, who were very anxious for this northern frontier, were difficult people to dealwith, and might even, by some arrangement with Feisal, make trouble for the French.

  Pour arriver a une entente avec Faysal,la France a modifie grandement ses vuesprimitives.  Pour rester en plein accordavec   le   Gouvernement  anglais,   M.Clemenceau est  dispose egalement a seprefer h ses vues et a faire des concessionssur 1&apos;Accord de 1916 en ce qui  concerneMossoul et la  Palestine,  mais il ne peut,sans renoncer a toute possibilite et a toutevaleur d&apos;un mandat  syrien, etendre leslimites Nord de la Palestine,  jusqu&apos;a labanlieue  de  Damas. au  benefice desSionistes,  renoncer au Hauran et  auxplaines fertiles qui dependent des couleesbasaltiques du Djabel Druz,&apos; abandonneraux  colonies juives toutes les  eaux deDamas, accepter la modification de carac-tere  politique  du  tract du  chemin  de feranglais, renoncer   non seulement a Mos-soul  (qui d&apos;ailleurs fait partie de la zoneA independante arabe et non de la zonebleue  oii  devait  seulement   s&apos;etendred&apos;aDres l&apos;accord de 1916  1&apos;administrationdirecte franchise,  fait  qui est  relevtsoecialement par Faysal) mais a 1&apos;Hinter-land du  mandat  frangais  a  1&apos;Est et auNord.  Les  vues  francaises  sont  d&apos;ailleursraisonnables et conciliantes:  il  est par-faitement possible d&apos;assurer aux coloniessionistes,  auxquelles  la  France  porteegalement beaucoup d&apos;interet, la disposi-tion d&apos;une  proportion importante  deseaux des sources qu&apos;elles reclament, maisbien entendu sans abandonner la posses-sion territoriale qui causerait  un detri-ment capital a la Syrie et nous empeche-rait de nous accorder avec Faysal.  De meme pour le  tract du chemin defer, s&apos;il est reconnu ntcessaire, d&apos;un com-mun accord, apres examen contradictoireet pour des raisons techniques, d&apos;empitterltgerement sur la zone A,  u,n  droit depassage peut  etre conctde,&apos; mais cela nepeut changer  la souverainete territorialeni aboutir a une modification politique duchemin  de fer anglais, quij  de  Caiffa aBagdad, deviendrait un chemin  de ferCaiffa-Damas-Mossoul,  supprimant  enfait nos propres lignes et le mandat syrienfrangais.  Enfin la concession sur Mossoul, en ce qui touche la France, a pour contre-partieessentielle, rtclamte par 1&apos;industrie et leParlement francais, la stricte tgalitt dans1&apos;exploitation  des  pttroles  de  Mtsopo-tamie et du Kurdistan.  Ce  point a uneimportance capitale,  en raison  de  laorivation  absolue et  des  besoins de  laFrance  en pttrole.   Comme le fer et lecharbon, le pttrole a pris dans  la vie du  In order to arrive at an understanding with  Feisal,  France  has  considerablymodified her  original views.  For thepurpose of remaining in full accord with britain, M.  Clemenceau is  equally pre-pared to endeavour to meet the views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,  and to make concessions on the Agreement of 1916, inso far as  Palestine and Mosul are con-cerned.   He  cannot,  however,  withoutrenouncing  entirely  a Syrian mandate,agree to the extension of the northernlimits of Palestine up to the outskirts of damascus for the benefit of the Zionists,renounce  the  Hauran  and the  fertileplains dependent upon the  basaltic out-crops of the  Djabel Druz, abandon ail the waters  of  Damascus  to  the   Jewishcolonies, accept the  modification  in  apolitical sense of the track of the Englishrailway, nor  renounce not only Mosul(which, moreover,  forms  part  of  theindependent Arab zone  A, and  not ofthe blue zone, where  alone,  according tothe Agreement  of  1916, direct  french administration should  be  exercised,  a fact which is specially raised by  Feisal),but also in the hinterland of tlie  Frenchmandate in. the east and north.  The French views  are after all  reason-able and conciliatory; it is quite possibleto assure  the  Zionist colonies, in which France  also takes a great  interest, thedisposal of  an important proportion ofthe waters which they demand, without,of  course, abandoning their  territorialpossession,  which  would  greatly depre-associate  the resources of Syria, and  preventFrance from coming to an understanding with  Feisal.  Similarly with the track of the rail-way; if it is recognised as necessary, by common agreement,   and after   a  jointexamination and for technical reasons,to encroach slightly on zone A,  a  rightof passage may be conceded.   This willneither affect the territorial possessionnor lead to a political modification of theEnglish  railway,  which,  instead  of running from Haifa to Bagdad, wouldbecome  a  railway   from   Haifa  toDamascus and Mosul, and would thus in.fact suppress French lines and the FrenchSyrian  mandate.   Finally, the Mosul concession in so faras  France  is concerned  entails, as anessential compensation demanded  alike by industry  and by the French Parliament,strict equality  in  the  exploitation ofpetroleum in Mesopotamia and Kurdi-stan:   This point carries  great impor-tance, by reason of  the absolute lack ofpetroleum in France and her needs  Likeiron  and  coal, petroleum has assumed  a

                        Fourth Meeting: Turkish Settlement.     The  Anglo-French,  discussion was continued at  a  meeting  at  3 P.M. on  the 23rd December in the Secretary of State&apos;s room at the Foreign Office. The Chairman of the International Commission at Constantinople.     Lord Curzon opened the meeting by explaining that  after the mornings meeting he had had a conversation with  the Prime  Minister who wished to  know how the discussions with M.  Berthelot were proceeding.   The Prime  Minister was inclined to favour  the  nomination of  an American  to the chairmanship  of the International Commission at Constantinople in preference  to the  principle  of rotation.   This point might be further considered  later.  M. Berthelot said that  he knew that M. Clemenceau was averse from the  plan of an American chairman in view of the present  American attitude generally. Frontiers of Palestine.     Lord Curzon  said  that the Prime Minister had also spoken to  him about  the northern frontier of Palestine.   There were two good reasons for maintaining the view that the Sykes-Picot line should be taken north so  as to include  the Litani bend, the headwaters  of the Jordan,  and the streams  flowing south from Mount Hermon in Palestine :      1. When the Sykes-Picot agreement was concluded it was on the hypothesis that           France and England would make approximately equal efforts in the matter           of men and money in conquering Turkey.  Unfortunately it  had turned           out that  the war in this theatre had had to  be fought almost entirely by           Great Britain, who had expended  some 750,000,0001. on all&apos;the Turkish           operations.   By  this no reflection was intended on the magnificent effort           made  by France in  the  European theatre.   If the  French Government           would  reimburse His  Majesty&apos;s Government  one  half of  this sum they           might have any boundary they liked here or elsewhere.     2. The  Prime Minister had publicly committed himself on more than one occasion           to the formula of  including in Palestine all the  ancient territories from           Dan to Beersheba.   He could not recede from this attitude.     If, however, M.  Berthelot had no authority to make an agreement  on  this matterand if the French Government adhered  to their attitude, Mr. Lloyd George was  quitewilling that the question should be submitted to arbitration by the United States.     M.  Berthelot asked that he might  be allowed to reply at once to the  case putforward by Mr. Lloyd George point by point:      1. It had never been agreed in  connection with the  Sykes-Picot agreement (and           the documents made no mention or hint  of it) that the two  parties to the           agreement  were to  make equal efforts in  prosecuting the war against           Turkey.  He did not wish to belittle the splendid effort which Great Britain           had made, and had been  in the fortunate position of being able to make,           against Turkey.  But he wished to recall the intense sacrifices which France           had made in the main theatre of the war as well as the predominant part           she had played in the important and victorious campaign at Salonika.  In           any case, he did not  think  it wise or  quite fair  for Allies to  dispute  or           bargain on the  basis of  their respective losses in men and money.   The           spirit of their alliance did not justify it.     2. With  regard to  the second  point,  M.  Clemenceau   had  never agreed  to           Mr. Lloyd George committing  himself in this  way.   The French Govern-           ment regretted that Mr. Lloyd George found himself  in  a difficult position           vis-a-vis the British public in ^this matter.   They would do what they felt           just and  possible to help matters.     In any case, M.  Clemenceau could not agree to American arbitration.   He thoughtit was a matter which the  British and French  Governments ought to be able to settlethemselves and, apart from this, America was  not  the  proper quarter to appeal to for arbitration.
     M. Berthelot  wished, however, to find a solution, and suggested that an Anglo-French Commission, or Commissions, of technical experts should be sent out and shouldmake recommendations to the Governments after examination on the spot      1.  As to how the needs of the  existing Zionist colonies for water-power could best           be met.     2.  As to the best trace for the British railway from Haifa to Baghdad.   Territorial           modifications might be made after the experts had  reported.  The question           would  thus be taken out of the  political sphere and treated  on economic           grounds.  M. Berthelot added  that the French  had no objection to the           railway from Haifa running  through the Yarmuk Valley to  Baghdad, but           they did not  wish it to  follow a trace north via Deir-es-Zor to Mosul, thus           impinging on their zone near Damascus.     Lord Curzon  doubted whether this would advance matters; peace with Turkey,which was so  essential,  would be  delayed,  and the technicians were quite  likely  todisagree, and could hardly eschew political considerations.   He asked Colonel Gribbon&apos;opinion.     Colonel Gribbon said that he thought he could  speak  for the British  War office on  this matter.    They felt there was enough technical information now available  tosettle the question at any rate in principle  without delaying peace with Turkey.     M. Berthelot interposed  that he  felt sure  he could find  a French engineer whowould consider the question quite impartially.     M. de Fleuriau then reverted to the question of the Sykes-Picot agreement.  He had examined tlie documents leading up to the Sykes-Picot agreement.  There was no mentionor thought of equality of effort.  The agreement was based on the discussions at Cairo  in1915 and negotiations with King Hussein.  M. Picot had had the documents relating  tothese negotiations  under  his eyes when discussing the 1916 agreement.     M. de Fleuriau  wished also  to recall  that M.  Clemenceau  had already made a concession not  only  as  regards Palestine, but  also as regards  Mosul, and  has  been strongly attacked by French public  opinion for the latter.  .     Lord Curzon  said that this might be quite true.  Nevertheless it was not thenforeseen that we in practice would have to do all the fighting and spend so much money in the East.     Mr. Vansittart pointed out that the technical  experts, who would not gain muchmore information than we had already, were quite likely  to  disagree, and we wouldthen probably come back  to the same necessity for arbitration with which we now seemedto be faced, and after perhaps a disastrous delay.     M. Berthelot  did not  think the French Government would regard the delay  so seriously, and agreed that it might eventually prove necessary  to  have an  arbitration.He did  not exclude the possibility in the last resort of  technical arbitration by a  goodAmerican engineer.     Lord Curzon asked what precisely M. Berthelot. meant by the word &quot; technical&quot;  inthis connection.     M. Berthelot suggested that the Railway Commission would have to  decide whatwas the most direct practical route from Haifa to Baghdad, and the Hydraulic Commissionwhether the Zionists needed territorial acquisitions as well  as an economic arrangement for securing the waters which they  required.     Lord Curzon  observed that  such terms of  reference as the  latter would not really  satisfy  the British  point of view  as regards the Zionists.   It  was not theexisting Zionist colonies of which he was thinking so  much as the.future immigration into these northern districts, and the development of colonisation.  The mere grant  of so much water would not suffice  to satisfy those who  looked to the reclamation of thecountry both north  and south of the Sykes-Picot line, and would never be satisfied  ifconfined exclusively to the latter, with an allowance  of so  much irrigation water fromthe region beyond.     M. Berthelot  replied that the  Zionists, not content with a frontier further to thenorth, would soon reach to Damascus.  He must maintain his standpoint.     Lord Curzon thought that in the circumstances no agreement  seemed possible  atpresent,  and that they must each report to  their respective Prime Ministers  and governments how  the matter now stood and the arguments used by  both sides.The Railway.     Lord Curzon then briefly explained the railway position, and said that for technical reasons any railway  from  Haifa into the  interior  must  pass  through the  YarmukValley.
    M, Berthelob stated that the French were perfectly willing for the railway to pass through  the Yarmuk Valley or through the polygon  of  territory mentioned in theSykes-Picot agreement and  so  to Baghdad.   They  objected, however, to the  more  ,northerly trace which had been proposed to Deir-es-Zor and Mosul.   It would  impingeon their sphere and upset their own plans.    Colonel Gribbon explained that this  proposal had been dropped for some  time.The British were now trying to find a trace completely in the British zone under theSykeV-Picot  agreement.  Nevertheless  it was  desirable  to  know  exactly  how the $JSykes-Picot line ran as  regards the  Yarmuk Valley.   It had been originally roughly  /drawn on a small scale map, which left in doubt  the precise topographical features.    M. Berthelot thought that this point need not create difficulty and could be settled by a boundary commission on the spot.Transjordania.    M. Berthelot  said  that Feisal had approached  him about his (FeisaPs)  State,including the whole of the Hauran,  which he apparently regarded as going as far south as Maan.   He also wished to discuss the question of Mosul, which, he had pointed out,fell even under the Sykes-Picot agreement in the Arab zone.    M. Berthelot had told Feisal that in both cases it was  a matter for discussion withthe British.    Lord  Curzon agreed that this was the correct  attitude.  Great  Britain  mustsettle these matters  direct with Feisal.Western  Boundary of Mosul Area.    M. Berthelot explained  that the French  Government desired their Syrian zone  toextend far  enough east  as to include the whole basin  of the River Khabur.  ColonelGribbon  said that the War Office accepted the French  point of view in this matter, andit was agreed to.Future of French Blue  Zone under Sykes-Picot Agreement.     M.  Berthelot stated that, in spite of the probable hostility of French  publicopinion,  his Government contemplated making the Syrian coastal         far  north  asAlexandretta a part of  a  Syrian State with Feisal as prince.   As regards the blue area in  Cilicia,  they intended, as already explained, to arrange for some kind of mandatewith  some nominal connection with  Turkey.   They would also facilitate  Armeniansettlement here.   They proposed, however, to give up to Turkey all the upper part ofthe blue area, the mountainous country round  Sivas and eastwards towards Kharput.They would, however, keep the strip of territory (in the blue area) running east fromCilicia and north of Syria, including the towns of Aintab,  Marash, Urfa, Birijik,  whichthey  now  occupy.   They would also occupy the country round Arghana Maaden andDiarbekir  (also in the blue area) and join  up to  the east  of Diarbekir with the south-west  corner of the  Armenian State.   In  reply  to an enquiry of Lord Curzon as towhether France would  not therefore be prepared to take the responsibility for looking after the proposed  Armenian  State, M. Berthelot  said  that this was impossible; theywould, however, see to  the protection of Armenians and  all Christians in  the areaabove described.      The question of Jeziret-ibn-Omar was also raised, and Colonel  Gribbon explained that  from  the military point of view the War Office saw no objection to this falling into the French area.  [A question has since been raised on this  point, and it may have to be reopened.]      M.  Berthelot claimed  that  the French were making considerable  concessions in putting  the blue coastal area into the  Syrian State and abandoning the Sivas area to&apos;the Turks.  Lord Curzon said that it  seemed to him that these were hardly concessionsso  much as measures  of expediency, designed in the  French interest.   The French would not even assume responsibility for the Armenians, as  the British were  doing  for        ,the Zionists.      M.  Berthelot replied that the British  appeared  to be in the happy position of having a claim over territories which expediency did not require them to abandon.  He agreed,  however, with Lord Curzon that in any case  neither France nor England we*e- ^t^o going to be badly off in the general settlement as proposed.
Water of Tigris.     M. Berthelot said that the French  Government would  of course adhere to thestipulations of clause 4 and the Sykes-Picot agreement regarding the conservation  ofthe waters of the Tigris and Euphrates.Arabia.     M. Berthelot stated that  he  had no  proposal to make regarding Arabia.   lord curzon recalled that in 1917 or 1918 discussion had taken place with M. Picot andM. Cambon, and  a &quot; projet d&apos;arrangement &quot; had been  drafted (but never confirmed)  inwhich the  French Government accepted the view of the  British Government that thelatter should have a preponderant position in  the Arabian peninsula owing  to itsproximity to Egypt and the Persian  Gulf, and to  Great  Britain&apos;s special interests andarrangements  with the Arab chiefs.   This  view had, he thought, also been  expressedin a note from the French Government to  His Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador in Paris in 1917.The matter should be regulated by special clauses in the Treaty with Turkey.     M. Berthelot said he thought that there would  be  no difficulty in this matter,.and  that he would examine the question on his return to  Paris.   He agreed with lord curzon that in principle the question might be taken up  in  Paris at the point wherethe question of the above-mentioned &quot;projet d&apos;arrangementhad left it.         (The meeting, in so far as Turkey was concerned, then terminated.)o
