JJlLl-Dopument  is  the  Property  ofCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.Draft Memorandum  for  the Cabinet.     I have  received to-day  the  results of the  Anglo-French Conference  on the Turkish.. settlement, and I can only describe them as disastrous and incredible.  J can only hope that the Cabinet will not accept them.     Let me  say at once that  they come as a complete surprise tome.  The discussions that have preceded them both at Conferences of Ministers  and at Cabinets have shown  a great divergence  of opinion.  On the  one hand, there were those, I believe in the majority, who wished to keep the  Turk in Constantinople, and on the other  hand there were  those who wished to turn him out.  Therefore it was with great relief that the Cabinet learned from&apos; the Prime Minister that Lord Curzon and  M. Berthelot were to prepare alternative plans for the consideration of the French and the British Cabinets ad referendum.   When the result comes before ns, there are no alternative plans, &quot;but only one plan, to turn the Turk  out!  I have heard that the reason&apos;given for this is that, whereas it  was thought that the  French favoured keeping the Turk in  Constantinople,  when the Conference began  it was found that they  did not.  But  the suggestion  that two  alternative schemes should be prepared was  due,  as I&apos; understand it, not to the existence of a French view, hut to the view of a considerable part of the British Government, and the fact that the French withdrew from the position which  they have carefully published (in order; I. believe, to cause trouble in the British Empire), is quite irrelevant to  the non-fulfilment of the  programme which, in deference to the  views of some, at any rate, of my  colleagues had  been  arranged.     My next point is even more astonishing.   Even those who wished  to turn the Turk out of Constantinople desired to show at least a particle  of  consideration for the other view.  Both the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon  had agreed to leave the Khalif a residence at Roum (what was  called  in  the Conference of Ministers which preceded this Conference of Anglo- French Ministers,  a &quot;garten&quot;).  To my amazement even this  small sign of consideration, for the other view has disappeared.  Absolutely nothing remains. The  Treaty as proposed (for which the British  alone will have to bear the responsibility) shows in every proposal complete disregard for every argument put  forward on behalf  of  those parts of the British Empire whose man power and resources  were  mainly responsible for the defeat of Turkey, and whose external and internal security depends upon the  solution.  You will  not do everything that they ask ; you have decided therefore  to give them every cause for complaint.   Indeed the proposal for the  Khalifs  residence in Constantinople,  so far as 1.  can  see, was not  even discussed at the Conference.     The change of front of the French., as they will he careful to publish, was made, as stated by M. Berthelot in conference  and in his memorandum, in deference &quot; aux vues du gouverne- ment Britannique.&quot;   I say  with great respect  that the British Government never formulated. any view in favour of turning the Turk out.   It is quite  true that  those of greatest authorityamongst us table  this view, but the Prime Minister, with that respect and consideration for his dissentient colleagues which is characteristic of him, had never lost an  opportunity of assuring us  that the matter was still under consideration.  .1. have no doubt whatever of the ability with-which Lord Our/on argued his  view, but  although  the French were permitted to have the Foreign 0(lice view and the Treasury view, M. Berthelot was not put in possession, so far as 1 can discover, of the India Office view.     Now what was  my suggestion on behalf of India,  in which Lord Milner  concurred?  My suggestion really amounted to this, that the Turk should  remain in nominal  sovereignty over all the country which the Prime Minister in January 1918 declared should  be his, but that we- should  compel him  to leave  the administration  of.-Turkey  in  Europe  to  an  International Commission governing on his behalf.   By this means pressure could be brought upon him to behave himself in  Asia, and we should he in a position to enforce  the decent administration of  Turkey in  Europe,  and to maintain the neutrality  of the unfortified Straits.  I cannot understand  how this would leave the  Turk more subject to the  intrigues of Germany  and Russia than he certainly will be if left in Asia Minor without any opportunity of  hearing, or inducement to listen to, our requirements and demands.     This proposal is dismissed  apparently  without  any  consideration.  I  contend  that it would give  us all the guarantees which M.  Clemenceau suggests  are necessary to prevent a catastrophe on reopening the  Straits, and would fulfil all the four points which,  he sets out at the bottom of page 5.  I have always understood that Lord Curzon regarded it as  administra- tively impossible,  but to  my amazement and  astonishment, it is. precisely the  kind of settlement, mutatis mutandis, which is actually put forward by the Conference itself for the administration of Adrianople and Smyrna,   Why  not then also for Constantinople?      io 670   100  1.20
     It is no use my saying more on the merits of the question.  1. would refer  my  colleagues to my last paper, of which I enclose a copy.   I believe the peace proposed will lead to gravemilitary  commitments, to serious  war,  and  to conscription  in   order  to  provide  for  ourinevitable requirements, and that it is wholly opposed to the interests of: the British  Empire,and I would ask the Cabinet, with  whom the last word rests, to reject it.   At the least! would urge the restoration of the proposal which lias disappeared,  to allow the Sultan to reside in constantinople if he so wishes.   As I stated al the Conference, 1  do not believe  he  will if heis not allowed sovereignty, but at any rate we shall not have forced him  to go.     On other important details,  1 would make these observations :       (1)  Is it necessary to  deal one  last blow at the Mohammedans by  saying  anything aboutSanta  Sofia?   Cannot we show some  slight respect for  their 500  year old possession?Have they not enough to hate us for without raising this new sore ?   Can we not leave all theMosques in Constantinople and in  Adrianople under the guardianship of the Khalif ?  This isriot a political question, it is a religious  question, and  there  is nothing to justify our proposed action except history.     (2)  One word about the Armenians and Kurdistan.   1 am  told  by  our  officers  inKurdistan that the only hope of  getting  the Turks  out of Kurdistan without prolonged, warfareis to get the Turkish Government at Constantinople on our  side.   Even then,  f  am  informed,it is going to  be difficult,  but  unless they will  help 1  am  told it is going to  be impossible,and  I do not believe you will be able to use Indian troops.     (3)  As regards the new capital of  Turkey, if the  worst conies to the worst, there are indications in the report of this  Conference that the Turk is not even to be  allowed  to  choosethis.   He is to be told whether to choose Konia or  Broussa.   1 hope that this  is not  so, evenin tlie unthinkable situation of his having to find a new capital.     (4)  1 notice that the Treasury, which expressed grave doubts as to the economic possibilityof the new Turkey views which were brushed aside are going  to ask for financial controlover  the Turkish Government  in  Asia, so there  is  to be  no tree  Turkish Governmentanywhere !  This is a new proposal and a startling one.     (5)  I notice further that the question of Geziret was raised,  and that the War Officesuggested  that it should go into the French area,   1 have already pointed out to Lord Curzonthat I am informed that this place is of great importance from the point of  view of the controlof the head waters of the river.     (6)  Very little was said at  the Conference about Syria, and the Cabinet is not informed as to whether the  French  are insisting upon an agreement with Feisal which is not in harmony with the Anglo-French Declaration arranged by Lord Robert Cecil  as  to  non-annexation  in syria  and Mesopotamia  and a form  of government welcome  to  the  populations  of thosecountries.     The Foreign  Office had before them my Cabinet papers  and the representations of theTurkish Delegation which, was received in Paris.   1 do not see in the Report  that  anythingwas said at the Conference which would show any sort of  regard for the minor points raisedtherein.   There is no suggestion  for a  new assurance that we will not  interfere  with theKhalifate, that we will not interfere with any voluntary  arrangement, spiritual or temporal,made between the Khalif and any Mohammedan country.  There is no suggestion  of the kind.that Mr. Balfour always favoured about a federation-of these old  parts of the  Turkish Empirevoluntarily coming together as members of  the League of Nations.  All  these points havebeemdismissed.     Lastly, 1. notice.that on page 19, at the end of the second day&apos;s proceedings, Lord Curzon drew attention to the military difficulties.   I.  hope that  the  military authorities at the WarOffice will be asked to express an opinion on  these military difficulties  before  we take thesesteps.  From what the Secretary of State for War said at tlie Conference of Ministers which preceded the Anglo-French Conference, aiid from what  J have heard from Lord Allenby andthe  Chief of the Imperial General  Stall, I think the  military side is all important.  I am incordial agreement with Lord Curzon in thinking that it would be disastrous to  dictate a peaceAvhich the Allies had not  the military strength to enforce.  1 do  not believe that Great Britainwill be found  willing to  indulge  in a  prolonged war  in  semi-tropical climates in order  toenforce a peace which, reading it from end to end, I cannot see is of any advantage to us.                                                                              E. S. M.     1st  January 1920.
