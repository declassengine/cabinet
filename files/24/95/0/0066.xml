*) 9 3&amp;   uC^lijtary Secret,&apos;07W Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,                   29th December 1919.  &apos;          ,  ,                     (Received 30th.)   &quot; 17234.  Following from Malleson&apos;s telegrams dated 22nd December :     &apos;; 1. My agents travelled to Merv from Kaakha with live Turks on 1.1th December.They had been in Daghistan, thence crossed  to Yamut country where they had spent10 days.  They  were in Tashkent,  Samarcand, and Bokhara  on a secret politicalmission.  According Lo them, insurgent Kurds with  the  aid of  Turkish troops, were engaged in  operations having as their  ultimate object the capture of Baghdad andejectment of the  British.   They (Kurds) would shortly be  joined  by the AzerbaijanRepublic which would  make  an  invasion of North-West  Persia.   They also statedthat Daghistan was already in full rebellion against Denikin and that Bolshevik-pan-Islam movement, with its object the destruction of the British power and of Russianreactionaries,  would count amongst its  supporters the  whole  of  the -Caucasus.Repeated to Tehran, Kasvin, Baghdad, and Constantinople.&quot;    &quot; 2. Continued reports that Bolsheviks are encouraging  starving armed bandsto raid into  Khorasan with object of seizing food, and cattle.   Bolsheviks hope inthis way to not only secure provisions but to create trouble and to gain (corrupt group)for intervention.   Repeated Tehran.&quot;    &quot; 3. Intelligence officer,  Bajgiran, reports that Bolshevik staff officers have duringthe last few days visited Gauclan,  just over  frontier,  in order to make , arrangementsfor billeting and supply of up to 1,000  Bolshevik. troops  who are shortly to comethere.   In view of  large reinforcements from centre now  undoubtedly beginning toarrive in Turkestan, this strengthening  of  all posts on Persian frontier is probable.It will mean, at  least, increased&quot;  difficulties  in intelligence  work,  and increasedsmuggling from Persia, which latter seems connived  at by Persian  officials.  RepeatedTehran.
