RENEWAL OF MEAT CONTRACTS.      Memorandum by the Food Controller,,       I agree with the President of the Board of Trade that  It is unnecessary at the present time to renew the contracts with thePlate Meat Companies, provided that;-    (i) arrangements are made for the shipment of a sufficient        quantity of beef from South America to meet United        Kingdom requirements:  and   (ii) that our control of insulated tonnage Is maintained...The Board of Trade have undertaken to make the arrangementsrequired in order to safeguard these supplies.     In so far as prices are concerned I am not clear thatcompetition from Colonial supplies would operate to keep downprices of South American beef, unless these supplies were Statecontrolled and   the Government were prepared to face a loss on them.   I propose, therefore, to retain for the present maximumwholesale and retail prices for imported meat, and to reduce the retail price of imported beef by 2d a lb, after tho end of thismonth.     In viewof the fact that practically two-thirds of the south american meat,is under  the control, direct or indirect, of the meat Trust Firms, I think that the reversion to normal tradingshould be regarded as an experiment and that the situation shouldbe reviewed in six months&apos; time *   The Australasian suppliesalready purchased will  not be exhausted until the end of  the year.GEORGE H, ROBERTSMINISTRY CP POOD.     JANUARY 5rd, 1919.
