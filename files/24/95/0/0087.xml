A ^ -Thi^PocuniSirttia fee pfcpe:-ty 6?tJtLSiS:Q.LL; Mi^^ GovernmentG A B I N K T.DE-CONTROL OP HOME-GROWN HEATMemorandum by.the Pood Controller&apos;       I have already indicated my view that all home agricultural&apos;products except wheat should be released from control at some point orpoints during the first six months of this year, and I have naturallydesired to be In agreement with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesas to the precise date when control should be released..   Partial statut-ory control of foodstuffs is always unsatisfactory and at the time whende-control of imported meat was decided, upon, I indicated that this.partial removal of control would involve me in administrative difficult-ies.o.  . This forecast Is already proving correct., as I have to arrangefor pecuniary compensation being paid to Smithfield wholesale dealersin home produced meat, who:are debarred from, the freedom which rivaltraders In imported meat now exercise..   Moreover., tho maintenance ofthe control of livestock in the interest of.the farmers will involvemy-meat accounts In a loss of approximately  1,000,0000       Prom the point of view of the consumer I do not anticipate any real hardship;   The proportion of home meat normally eaten during thefirst six months of the year is comparatively low, and I agree with lord Lee that while the best qualities of meat will rise in price., theinferior qualities will be below the statutory maximum.   So long astransport facilities aro adequate for .gettlng sufficient supplies of imported meat-throughout the country., I do not think that any seriouscomplaint from consumers will arise;   The stabilising element, so faras prices are. concerned., consists in the maintenance of an adequate supply of imported meat of good -quality.0       I anticipate a considerable outcry from the farmers, who :wlllcomplain that my Department has broken faith with themc   This Imputat-Ion&apos;Is in some measure true, as although there was no guarantee of a market, there was a guarantee of price and a reasonable assurance of a market for prime quality meat,,   I should., therefore&apos;,f myself have prefer-red a measure of compensation.,although I fully recognise the political difficulties  standing in the way of any such measure-, .       I propose to retain the Livestock Commissioners and a nucleusstaff for emergency purposes until the 30th April, but I feel bound to .point out that.the. present organisation once dissolved can never, bereplaced,  . Moreover, experience has shown that It Is Impossible to:establish effective maximum prices for home-grown meat without complete control of livestock.   I am, however/ convinced that some other.meansmust be ,fo.und for the encouragement of home production than the ma Into n-anee of prices at an artificial level,   I should have -preferred to try this experiment later In the year, but as the end of this month marksthe limit of  a possible subsidy for home cheese, and as this represents the latest possible date on which home meat can bo de-controlled unless.you go right,  through until July, I am content to face the risks involvedin,the adoption of Lord Lee1s proposal.   At the same time the conditionscreated by the war in regard to supplies and prices are so abnormal andthe present world economic&apos;situation, so.uncertain, that the Cabinet&apos;would no doubt review the whole situation if a policy of de-control-wereto result in  prices rising unduly or in unequal distribution,,MINISTRY OP FOOD,    3rd JANUARY, 1920GEORGE, H, ROBERTS..
