Cr. 18 *\             CENSUS 1921.                 /     ;               ...........-------- A$%M0RANDUM BY THE MINISTER 0?&apos; HEALTH.   1,   The approval of the Cabinet is desired to the early introduction this Session of a Census Bill  on the linesdescribed below, in order that powers may be available forthe conduct of  the regular decennial Census of populationdue in 1921.                                                  i   2.   Hitherto every Census Act in this country hasrelated only to the particular impending Census for whichpowers were immediately requisite, and has  contained in itself the detailed particulars  to be included in the Schedules ofenquiry; the last Census  in 1911 necessitated two such Acts,one applying to Great Britain, the other to Ireland.  It issuggested, however, that  it is time that this countryadopted the course of passing a permanent Census Act,,conferring powers generally in relation to the taking ofCensuses, in accordance with the  line already adopted by nearly all the Dominions and Great Powers in connectionwith  Censuses of population, and  by the United Kingdomitself in connection with  the Census  of Production,   3.   Such a Bill should also empower a Census to be takenquinquennially.  A quinquennial Census (with perhaps  arestricted  field of subject matter in every alternatequinquennium)  is agreed on all hands  to be highly desirable,-and  is already usual  in Prance, Germany and several  of theDominions.  Population figures for administrative areas  arerequired  for a  number of  statutory or administrative  purposes;for  example, under the London  (Equalization of Rates)  Act,1394, they  govern  financial  adjustments of  considerable                                                       i importance.  During  the  intercensal  period  the necessaryfigures  for all such purposes  have to be estimated;  butas the material afforded  by  the previous census  becomesmore and more  out  of date, the estimates become  less and less
reliable.  Even as regards ihe population as a whole(for the estimation of which -supplernantary--^throughout the intercensal period) substantial error has been disclosed by the census in the estimates for the years immediately preceding\. while as regards administrative.;areas.rthe estimates during the latter part of a decenhium can be &apos;li^tleL^more than guesses.   4.   Even more serious than the unreliability of these estimates for administrative purposes is. the extent to whichit vitiates intercensal statistics of all kinds.  The numberof deaths (e.g*) from a particular cause in the population ofa given district, or of persons in a given occupation or age group, is statistically valueless unless it is known how many people there are in the district or occupation or age group - in other words, unless the information can be stated as a rate. If unreliable population estimates haveto be employed for the purpose of such rates, the rates them-Belves are equally unreliable; and as the margin of error isconsiderable, the results may be  serious.  An under-estimate of population for a district may cause consternation by imputingto it an extravagantly high mortality rate; while an over-estimate may confer a false serse of security upon an unhealthyarea.   5.   In the later years of the current decennium, the processof estimation has been assisted by the data derivable from food,etc. rationing and the National Register; but these will not beavailable in future.  Accordingly, since the permanent Act nowproposed must contain provisions  governing the frequency of future Censuses, it is felt that  these provisions ought not to be framed so ae to exclude the possibility of a quinquennial Census.It is recognised that the question of cost depends so.muchupon the future re-arrangement of local administration that itwould not be reasonable at the present stage to seek to commit
the country to a quinquennial Census.  But the Bill should contain the necessary powers, subject only to the financialand administrative consideration which may be prevailingwhen the occasion arises,   6.   On the plan suggested, a short Bill only is necessary,enabling Censuses to be taken not more often than once in fiveyears and providing for the determination of the detailedparticulars upon each occasion by Orders in Council,  foucha Bill would have great advantages as compared with theprevious&apos; system of Census Legislation in this country, i.e. -   (i)   The Bill would be very short and its contents non-controversial.   (ii)  It would effect a saving of Parliamentary time, bothpresent and future.  Only one short Bill would now be neededinstead of two detailed Bills as in 1910; and no Bills at allwould be needed Upon subsequent occasions.   (iii) It would afford sorely needed time for the properconsideration of the particulars for the 1921 Census, whichis of exceptional importance  as the datum-line for futurestatistics.  The * ar has very largely interrupted the continuity of previous statistics;  and we must start afresh in certain respects.  If the detailed particulars are to be included  in theBill as in 1910, then their  consideration must be perfunctory;and the time for the administrative arrangements (which couldnot be undertaken till the passing of the Act) would be in-sufficient.   7.   If these arrangements are approved,  I should  proposethat the necessary  degree of  close touch between myself and the Ministers responsible for the Census  in  Scotland  andIreland as regards  the nature of the particulars to beobtained in each  country and  the numerous details  (bothstatistical and administrative) upon which  agreement  is                                                 desirable/
                    m Q **desirable, should  be secured by constituting an ad hocjoint committee of the Ministers acting by deputies.Ministry of Health/                            C. ADD IB ON.                                                16.12.19..
