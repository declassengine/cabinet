/          ^ &apos;Th!s Document is the Property ofNilf^v     His Britannic t\A &amp; j e s t y&apos; s Q o v e r i. r n e n t.)           -      22L wPROPOSED MINISTRY OF MIKES.emorandum by the President cf the Board of Trade.      I doubt whether.the Coal problem will  be  satisfactorily solved until a Ministry of Mines  is  established  and  a Minister is appointed&apos;to devote his  whole time to  its  study. Whether the Ministry should be a permanent  one,  or continue merely for the reconstruction period,  would be for the future to  determine.      It is important  to  realise not  only that the Coal problem, with its  financial,  social,  economic and technical aspects, is extraordinarily complicated, but also that a failure to solve it will he  disastrous.  Chances of making mistakes are  many, and  it will not be  easy  to find a safe and practicable policy. &apos;  The  financial&quot;side  is no small care,  amounting to about .C325  million per Annum i      The Government has  already announced its intention to nationalise Royalties.   The  framing  of a scheme, procedure- ure,  and administration  aftor  the  -scheme is carried through, will  call  for  continuous  application. . The  financial issues in this Halted connection.are, though relatively small, not unimportant.   They amount to something like six millions a year,. Again,  there  is the question of the  collection and disposal of the  Social Amelioration Fund,      But more  intractable  than the problem  of royalties is the problem of the future  organisation and  conduct of the industry.  This touches the question of output, which is unpleasantly short when to  the needs of -  this&quot; Country are added  the  demands that may be expected on the part of Europe for some time  to come  Our. future industrial prosperity and our position as a shipping power are based  fundamentally on cheap  and  adequate supplies of coal.   In view of this, the present economic and labour situation being what it is, it would  certainly, seem to  he  imprudent to leave the extension and development of the industry, the advance of technical method; and the utilisation of resources,  together with thf labour and other  questions connected with the problem, entirely to private initiative, the play of economic forces and collective bargaining,  there being  no lUnistry, authorised to act at     $.l,;.ast  in a watching,, and  advisory capacity.   Moreover, it has to be  remembered that the  enormous profits  on coal exports, which  may  continue for some  time, necessitate control, to avoid  excessive accumulations  in a few hands, the unchecked diversion  abroad cf supplies urgently needed here, and a consequent advance in home prices that would prove most damaging,  perhaps ruinous,  to  our interests.      I should  not press  this point in normal times, but the times  are  not  normal, tand the argument at  the present moment is fortified by the menacing labour  outlook.  In view of the labour outlook alone,  I  cannot believe that it will be found possible to go back entirely  to the pre-war position.  The restlessness&apos;of the  coal miners, accentuated by  the-War, has been  further increased by the  agitation worked up on the ouestion of nationalisation.   I am afraid that the passage from  war to peace  conditions  is in danger of being marked by                                                      an/
 an  explosion,  if something is not done to signify new relations &quot;between Labour, Capital, and State.  what is to bo the character Of  the so new relations, I hesitate to attempt to forecast in this memorandum; I  question, indeed, whether it is possible to devise: in  advance a plan to satisfy the men and the owners and to con- form with the  economio requirements of the industry.  The alternative is to move step by step in the direction in which the force of oircumstances compels..  The elements to bo reconciled are largely psychological and at the moment are arranged in irreconcilable groups at opposite poles.  They are however extraordinarily mobile and&quot;it is impossible to predict the position they will occupy te-morrow..  I myself feel sure that a ministry with no responsibility except far mines is necessary if opportunities perhaps irrecoverable are not to be let slip.     Lly work in connection with Coal sinoe I have been at the Board if Trade has taught me that the present arrangements are not satisfactory.  The President of the Board of Trade must always have his hands full with the industrial and commercial problems of the Country, and at the present time, when the Country is passing from war to peace conditions, nearly everything that is happening has significant economic bearings which require his constant . study.  In leaving hk also responsible for the commercial side qf coal (&apos;che Home secretary retains the old Home Office ice powers in connection with csal mines and tho Minister of Labour deals with labour and wage questions arising in. the industry) there is a fear not only of failure in the solution of the Coal problem, but also of trouble in other directions as a result of the diversion of his attention from industrial and commercial questions.     The nucleus of a Ministry ef Mines would be the Coal Mines Department.  To this should be added the funotions of the Home Office in  connection with mines; and in the peculiar circumstances of the case the new Ministry would have to share in, or keep in close  ) touch with, the work now performed by the Ministry of Health in regard to housing in Colliery DiStriots, and with the Ministry of Labour in regard to wages and cost tf living.  A Ministry of Mines would not be an too vat ion; there are already Ministries of mines in all the self-governing Dominions.  If the Cabinet should desire it, I am willing for a little longer to attempt to continue my dual responsibility, but I fear that if I do somed&amp;gree of failure is inevitable.  The mere physical strain of trying to cope with the work of the two Departments, the Board of Trade and the; Coal Control,  is severe,  i&quot;venture to doubt if in present circumstances when problems of the greatest urgency arise almost hourly and when both Offices are,, as they have beon, in a state of transition, any human being could indefinitely continue with-; efficiency and satisfaction to himself to bear the double load.     In conclusion, I most strongly urge the Cabinet to decide to ask from Parliament powers to establish a Ministry, of Mines, and to begin with, simply to concentrate in it existing Government powers with regard to mines of all sorts.  If that be done I believo a long stop towards securing peace in the industry next year will have been taken, as if the men see something being done they will not be sa impatient as they now are.                                         -  A.C.GSDDSS17th Dec, 1919.
