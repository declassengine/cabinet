314(PHIS POClftaSLiT IS 3HS PROPERTY Of HIS BHIMHIC MAJESTY1S QOTOiatSI^).        THS SHIfrHHG POSITION II? PTJiLATIOH TO           TO ALLIED POOD ERQGaAifilE.1.   Tho attached memorandum has boon submitted to the consultative ^oofl Committoe hy Monsieur Avonol, tho ChiefFrench representative upon it.   The question of the provisionof tonnago is net within the scofco of the Consultative FoodCommittee, but it hoars so directly upon its work that I havothought it desirable to submit tho memorandum to the Cabinet.8.   A complaint on similar lines has boon made by the ItalianGovernment,  Indeed, the suoply of relief to Vienna was held up for several days by the auddon withdrawal of British ships from Italian use by the Ministry of Shipping.Z,   The immediate cause of these withdrawals of tonnagofrom French and Italian use is tho insistence by the YflieatCommission that its programme of wheat and maize which has fallen heavily into arrears must be fulfilled.  On &quot;fheat alonefrom 1st September to 31st December tho estimates deficit of arrivals IB 320,000 tons,   Tho Ministry of Shipping statethat this programme cannot be fulfilled, save at tho exponsoof very serious inoonvonienoo and loss to British ship-owners,without withdrawing British ships frcm tho use of the?rench and Italian Governments.CABINET,,It
                                                       -   315      It will be reoallei that in tho Spring shipping KM  froodfrom roaulsition, Ifr view of the ospootations of tho  Ministry ofShipoing and indeed of moat shipping experts that long before theena of the year there would be&quot;*&quot;a surplus of tonnago available and a consequent reduction in freights.   for reasons outsidethe oontrol of the Ministry of Shipping, these expectationshave not been realised,,   Whilst tho quantity of tonnage afloatis greater now even than bofore the war, tho efficiency ofshipping has boon reduced to such an extent by delays in docksan$ ports all over the world and by other oaueea, that aotuallyfreights have      heavily risen and tho shipping position appearsto present at the moment elmost es many difficulties, taking abroed view of the needs of the Europej ea during the   4,   It Is not merely that British programmes are  falling  intoarrears und  that owing to the action that has had to  be taiien,to put  them  straight^ the French and Italian programmes havebeen plungod into chaos, but if Europe can  find finance withwhich to satisfy her minimum, need of foodstuffs it looks  as  ifthe ships may not bo available  to transport thoso foodstuffs.During  1919  Germany imported from  overseas about 700,000 tonsof foodstuffs.   Her need during  1920 will not be appreciablyless, if she la  not to run so short  of  food as  to risk most dangerous disorder.  Up  to the  present  she  has  been  livingupon hor harvest and has importoA vary  little.  If Germanycomes on the world fieight market f::-x  transport for  largequantities  of foodstuffs between now and  tho Autumn, theeffect  on the British and Allied shipping position and  onfreights may be  very serious.   5.   The  politioal effect on  our  relations with ?ranoo  and,Italy of the withdrawal  in  this  manner of British ships nead^no emphasis, but it may  be well to  point  out that  if,  ad  &amp;result, France  eeeses  to oo-operator in the  purohsae  of  food-*stuffs  the  oost to  this  country may well  run into  tons  ofmillions. -   We  are by  far  the heaviest purchasers  of oversea^foodstuffs  and  we  have,  therefore,  most to  loae by thoforcing up  of prices by  competitive purchases.   The  Trench
fully realise thia arid olaim that if thoy are prepared to co-operate In connection with foodstuffs, it is not unreasonablethat we should co-operate in connection with ships.  They-donot ask ,th/?t we should-provide the ships &quot;but merely that shipping arrangements should be so organised that the AlliedGovernments $fin, when a programme has been agreed upon,reasonably rely upon its being carried out.                                    o   6.  In viev/ of the serious politival and economic issues            of                      1involved end/the actual ohange in the situation since thepresent policy with regard to shipping was inaugurated, itis submitted.         That the Cabinet should review Its shipping policy         in its relation not only to British but to Allied         and Relief needs;  and that for this purpose a         Cabinet Committee should examine the programmes         and arrangements of the various Departments         concerned as well as the probable requirements of         tonnage for essential Allied and Relief needs,         having regard to tho present European situation,         with a view to reporting to the. Cabinet as to the         best method by which such services as are         necessary can bo guaranteed. .                          (Signed)   GEO^ H* ROBERTS.

IiONDKES,  LB  Deceit ICth                                                               1919.    Ho. 56*  Sir,        I &quot;beg to refer to our previous conversations concerning  the refusal of licences to ships on charter to Frenoli  Ravitaillement and to the correspondence on this subject passed  between the Hudsons Bay Co. - acting as Agent for the Ministers  du Ravitaillement - and the Shipping Controller.   I hold copies  of this correspondence at your disposal and I feel bound to  present hereafter a full statement of the case for your consideration.        As you are well aware, the ideal French monthly programme  of Breadstuffs averages about 350.000 tons which can be, and in  fact has - owing to adverse circumstances - been reduced to  320,000 tons as against 500,000 tons for Great Britain and 200,000  tons for Italy.        The responsibility for supplying the necessary tonnage was  placed on the respective countries, when the Food Consultative  Committee was established  early in August, it being definitely  stated that each country should provide its own  finance and  tonnage.        In order to avoid undue competition in chartering and  also to secure as far as possible the automatic  granting.of  Licences, we further arranged with  the Ministry  of  Shipping  to  keep in constant consultation on our chartering  operations and  Mr. VILGRAIfl was definitely informed that refusal of licences  to  ships chartered  in accordance with  the above  arrangements  would not  take place except in  very special circumstances.
                                                             318     The p re sent -shipping --arraagejxieiit-B ftrtr- the - oxe-cutioruoi!cur programme are as follows,-Out of a total of   ....   320,000 tonsabout.................   150,000 tons are carried under the -Prench flag, which do not come under the British Licencingsystem.The remaining 170,000 tons, roughly speaking are carried on;-a) *. Neutral ships on time charter ...     30,000 tons.b) - Steamers belonging to the Bay s/8 Oo. 40,000 tons.c) - Balance, viz........................100,000 tone       on ships flying the British flag      (l/4 being voyage charters and 3/4       time charter)     It should be realised that the above steamers have beenchartered in the open market, without any help from the BritishGovernment.     We felt justified to cover thus our tonnage needs as weheld ourselves to be covered against undue risks by our arrange-ments with the Ministry of Shipping.     I am sorry to say that our  expectations were not fulfilledas from October 24th to December 10th licences have been re-fused to nearly 150,000 tons of RavitatUement tonnage, out ofwhich one refusal has been revoked (s/s BAYFORD - 7400 tons)whioh brings the actual nett loss to our J?ood Import programmeup to December 10th to 135,140 tons d,w* (approximately equalto the total of British tonnage of all classes at the disposalof the l*french Eavitaillement for the corresponding period).     The Ministry of Shipping has informed me that thesediversions of tonnage are the outcome of definite demands made by the British Ministry of Food with the concurrence of the &quot;Wheat Commission.     Prom this information I can only infer that in order tosecure the 500,000 tons of British arrivals, it has been foundnecessary to divert 135,000 tons on l^rench sarvioe, as, although
no official information has reached mo on this point, I understand from Paris that similar diversions of tonnage on Italianservice are taking place.     It would thus appear?-1) - That the British Government not only has not taken thonecessary steps to ensure tho provision of its own tonnage asper the Consultative Food Committee!s agreement, but also is taking array fr0m Its partners oh this Committee, the tonnageunion they have with tho greatest difficulty been able toprovide in execution of this agreements2) * The very high proportion of the diversions thus demanded by the Ministry of Pood corresponds to tho sudden withdrawalwithout notice of nearly all British tonnage under French charterwhich fact can hardl&quot; bo reconciled with the principles ofeconomic co-operation to which the Allied Governments havoheretofore adhered and which have again been confirmed by youat Rome on behalf of the British Government *3) - It is a well-known fact that so-called &quot;directed voyages&quot;entail heavy losses to the French Treasury, the extent of whichmay be approximately figured at  400,000 equivalent to adirect contrlbtJ&amp;ion by the French.government to the Britishbread subsidy.   You are well aware that the French Governmenthas always been more than ready to  ive any assistance within their power to overcome any difficulty experienced by tho BritishGovernment and I may point out, in connection with the financialside of the matter, that on the flour cargoes wo offered to divertto London during the Railway strike, the freight has been charged by us at bare cost price (see I-Ir. Dupont*s lottor dated november 16th)
     I feel it my duty to jplace the shove facts before youae Chairman of the Consultative Pood Committee, as I feelthey seem to indicate an entire departure from theprinciple of co-operation hitherto adhered to by all governments participating in the C,P,0, and ore In myopinion entirely inconsistent- with the very basis of theCommittee.                    I amj Sir,                       Your obodient Servant,                           (Sgd) P.AVEN0L. &apos;The Rt. Eon, The 7!arl of Crawford,            and Belcarres,
