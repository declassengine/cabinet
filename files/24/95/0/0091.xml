SECRET.THE  CABINET.LABILITY  OF  TERRITORIAL  FORCE  FOR  GENERAL                              SERVICE.       memorandum  UM BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I  desire particularly to  take  the opinion and decision of the Cabinet on  the___following  crucial  question, viz.,  shall  the  Territorial  Force  be reconstituted  under  ^eDithe existing liability for home service or shall they be reconstituted on a new liability   9874for general service operative in a national emergency sufficiently grave to require the calling out of the Army Reserve by Royal Proclamation ?    The arguments in favour of the  latter  course are  set  out  in the papers I havealready circulated, and there is no doubt that,  from a military  point  of view,  theadvantages are overwhelming.   Further,  the  enquiries which  we have  made fromofficers in  close touch with the Territorial Force in various parts  of the country are allfavourable to this new and extended * demand being made  upon the Force.  I must,however, admit that I  have personally very serious  misgivings as to the practicability of  such a policy.   I  consider   it  essentially unfair  to  ask men  who  are  notsoldiers to  take  on a liability  to  be  sent  away  to India,  Egypt,  Mesopotamiaor  the  Black  Sea for long  periods  while  the  mass of  their fellow-countrymenpursue their ordinary avocations and  bear no  part whatever of the national burden.Therefore, when addressing the Territorial Force Associations at  the beginning of theyear,  I stated that the Territorial Force would  not be ordered out of the countryexcept  as part  of  an emergency sufficiently grave  to require  the passing of  aConscription Act.    I fear very much that men will be deterred from joining the Force by this  addedrequirement.   Their employers  and  their wives will certainly  exercise a deterringinfluence in many cases.  A Bill  has  to  be carried  through  Parliament amending  theTerritorial Force Act, and during the  passage of this Bill it seems to me certain thatobjections  will be raised  which will advertise most prominently to all potential recruits theserious and far-reaching character of the obligation which they are contracting.  It willalso very  likely be said by the  Labour Party and papers that we are trying to get an  army  for  some foreign war  which we have  in  mind.   I  do  not  anticipate any difficulty from the Parliamentary^opposition,  nor, indeed, from opposition  in thecountry, but I do fear very gravely a lack of response in recruits.  Of course it  wouldthen be possible, though  certainly very disappointing, to drop the demand for  the overseas obligation, not to introduce any  Bill, and to  go on  as we are now.  Thatwould, however, involve admitting that a false move had been made and  the situationmiscalculated.    On the other hand the value of the Territorial Force from a military point of view,having regard to the kind of  problems which we- have to face in the next  few  years, is largely  dependent, in the opinion of the military authorities,  upon the acceptance ofthis extended liability.    I  do  not  feel  able,  myself,  to  take the  responsibility of deciding, and  I  askspecifically for Cabinet  guidance on the point.WINSTON  S.  CHURCHILL.WAR OFFICE,     5th January, 1920.(B20/48)  100 1/20 H&amp;S  7848wo
