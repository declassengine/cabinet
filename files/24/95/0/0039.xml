&quot;111MiXitat^v Secret.mmDocument isIICthe  PiFromiceroy, Army department, to Secretary of Stale for India,            I8lh December 1919.                                (Received 20th.)            Continuation of telegram 16845.  Malleson telegraphs 14th December :     &quot; Party brought lengthy message  from Bailey dated 29th  October and  12thNovember.  Copies will be forwarded you by mail to-morrow.  There is not much in them not already known.  Following are few points : -    &quot; 2.  Bolsheviks are bringing two armies to Turkistan, each 75,000 strong ; objectto force revolution throughout East, beginning with Afghanistan and Persia.    &quot;3.  Reports arrival  of  number  of Roumanian prisoners of  war in  Bokhara.More are coming.   They have no money or arms.  He suggests that  the prisoners ofwar be allowed to go to India through Afghanistan.    &quot;4.  Bailey says nothing about having asked to see Amir,  but Russian officer whobrought his letter says that as Bailey has no credentials Bokharan officials view him with suspicion and  will have no dealings with him.  I hope  by now my letters havesafely reached Amir and that he is helping Bailey.   Latter  is living with  Russianofficers and gets information  from them, as he knows little Russian and German.    &quot; 5.  Russian officer who brought  papers gives me following  additional informa-tion :-Amir  and ministers  and  millions  of  Bokhara people detest Bolsheviks, butAmir is in difficult  position  and  endeavours to assume very non-committal attitude.There is no truth, as far as  informant is aware, in story of Kabul-Bokhara marriage.Afghans are hated by all.   Afghan Consul, Abdul Shakur, plastered walls with anti-British propaganda, but these were torn  down by populace and spat upon.  Bokharans(including Bailey) are quite in dark regarding outside events, and  have  no idea of present position of civil  war.   (Evidently Amir does not reveal news  I send himperiodically)   Afghans bring from Mazar-i-Sharif direction large quantities of piecegoods,  boots,  tobacco  and matches.   They take Nicolai notes and gold and silvercoinage in exchange,  and latterly have been  taking  much  raw  cotton.  Bolshevicssaid to be short of rifles and ammunition (but recent captures from Koltchak  shouldhave eased this).&quot;mm
