I therefore wish to address to my colleagues once more a few arguments on a question of such vital importance to the peace of the British Empire.    1 would urge at the outset that we should keep this aspect of the question in view ahoveall  others.   We are  now practically alone in  the peace negotiations with our French Allies.I have never noticed in the  whole course of  the peace negotiations that they have had anyother motive than the well-being of France, and it  will not be for France to taunt us if weemulate at least  their  patriotism and  consider our  own  interests  and  the  interests  ofour Empire.    1 approach this question  firstly as the representative of the Indian  Empire at  the PeaceConference, and from a consideration of the interests and views of India.    Let me say that I know of no other question on which Indian opinion, of whatever race,colour or creed, is so unanimous.  The members of my Council here, the Viceroy&apos;s Govern-ment, Hindus and Mohammedans, whose opinion is expressed  in  speech and in writing, inletter and in telegram, Governors and Lieutenant-Governors, Chief Commissioners and PoliticalAgents, have all only one view, that it is  to the interest of India to adopt the policy which Iadvocate, and that any other policy will be fraught with grave danger to the  peace of the Eastand will  be resented throughout our Indian Empire.   This is not a question of  opinion, but of fact.  I am  responsible for conveying  to  my colleagues  such  facts  as  these.  They candisregard them if they wish, but if I do not succeed in bringing home to them the facts of thecase I shall have failed in my duty to those whom 1 represent.   India  is unanimous andnothing has  so much made for the unity of Hindus and Mohammedans in India ;  nothing willgive so great an opportunity for the extremist to foment discontent as a peace which is not in accord with India&apos;s views.     The Cabinet is  entitled  to disregard the warnings and the facts, but I would  once morerespectfully say that India has the same claim to be considered  in  these matters as Australiahas in  the  destinies of  the Pacific.  It was  largely by Indian troops  that  Turkey wasconquered, and Turkey-s lute  affects the internal and external security of our Indian Empire.     What then is the peace  that I advocate ?  I cannot describe it better than in  the PrimeMinisters own words:      &quot; Nor are we fighting to destroy Austria-Hungary or to deprive Turkey of its capital, or ofthe rich and renowned lands of  Asia Minor and Thrace, which  are predominantly Turkishin race.&quot;    &quot; Outside  Europe we believe that the same principles should be applied.  While we donot challenge  the maintenance of the Turkish Empire in the homelands of the Turkish racewith its capital at Constantinople the  passage between the Meditteranean and the  black sea being  internationalised and neutralised Arabia,  Armenia, Mesopotamia,  Syria and palestine are in our judgment entitled to a recognition of their separate national conditions.&quot;    The Prime Minister has assured  the  Cabinet that this  is not a pledge, that  it was an offer to Turkey  to make  peace.  All I can  say is  that there were no words in. the speech(which set out  the war aims of the British Empire) which support this construction.   But Ido not want to argue whether it was a  pledge  or not;  I merely wish to  state  that it was understood in India (I was there when it  was telegraphed out) to represent  the war aim of theBritish Empire then, and that it represents the policy which  I Avould urge  upon the Cabinetnow;..      &apos;         .                             .:                            - &apos;    I would further observe that even if it was an offer to Turkey of which she did not availherself, if  it would have  satisfied the British Empire  then  I cannot see  why it should  not satisfy the  British Empire now.  All arguments that to leave the  Turk  in Constantinoplewould  be  dangerous to British  interests  and to  the peace  of Europe go by the  board ifwe were ready to endanger the British Empire and the peace of Europe at the beginning of1918.    It is further said that if Turkey is not turned out of Constantinople, it Avill be regardedthroughout the East as an admission that the Turk is not beaten.  1 cannot conceive that this argument  can be put forward  seriously.   When you force the Turk to surrender  his sove-reignty over Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and, I hope, Kurdistan ; when you force him tosubmit to the neutralisation and to the international control of the Straits, and to the demolition of the forts which guard  them, that he can possibly claim, or that  anybody could  possibly      10  599  100  12/19
 believe, that he was not beaten, is to my mind as ludicrous  as to suggest &quot;that Carpentier did not beat Beckett because he did  not cut off his head.  And in the East, vendettas, revenge, the sullen nursing of a wrong after  punishment has been enforced is a policy which finds no favour.     But it is not only a consideration of the Indian aspect which I regard as so serious.   It is from the point of view of the Middle East that I also urge my case.  Turn the  Turk out of Constantinople by means of your troops there if you like, and then, with a sense of grievous wrong not  righted, what  will the  Turk do ?  Surely his course is clear.  He will join the forces of disorder in  the world, link up with the Bolsheviks, and through his  many agents make trouble for us  in Mesopotamia, Syria,  Palestine, Egypt,  Northern Asia,  right to the confines of China, in Afghanistan and in India, where &quot; Turkey irredenta &quot; will be a sore  for many years to  come.  During all the long delays  he  has gathered strength, and  you  will  be making a  peace  which will endanger for many months  or years to  come  the  peace of the world.  You will require hundreds  of thousands of troops, and you will not be  able to use Indian troops either.  All  the time  that the Turk is fighting, unrest and riot and danger will be present in India,  If  I  thought that this peace would be  accepted, and that after  its signature peace would reign  in the  world, unjust and unfair as it is, I would be inclined  to accept it; but it is  because I am convinced that, even if the Turkish Government accepts  it, it will mean fighting,  and  because 1  am convinced  that  all  the time fighting is going on British interests in  countries for which we are responsible will  suffer, that my anxieties and objections are doubled.     I would observe, further, that  it has been reported to the Cabinet  that M.  clemencoau  expressed his willingness to leave the Turk in Constantinople, but  that  he  would adhere  to our wishes.   The French have always been jealous of our position vis-a-vis Muslim opinion  in the world.   They have viewed with envious -eyes our success in  the East  as contrasted with their failure  in Algeria, and my anxieties are increased  by the certainty  that it will be  upon us of all the Allies that the responsibility for  turning the  Turk out will fall in the opinion  of the world.     And on the other hand, what do we gain ?  The possibility, or as I think the certainty,  of using armed force and losing control of the rulers of  Turkey ; whereas if the Turkish Govern- mentI-was kept in the homelands of. Thrace, we should be able to see thai, it did everything we required in maintaining peace in Asia Minor and withdrawing its forces  from Kurdistan and Armenia.   The Government  is continually seeking  means of economy.   I know of nothing which will make for greater  expenditure than to make a peace which will involve us in large military commitments.     So far as  I am aware,  whenever this matter has been discussed in the  Cabinet the majority, at any rate, shared  my view.  I would urge them  to adhere to that opinion,  an opinion which is also shared, so far as 1 am aware,  by all our military and naval advisers.     Yesterday  I received from Lord Milner a letter, from  which I quote  the following: &quot;I &quot; should like to have had a word with you about Turkey.   1 tried very hard once more before &quot; I left, but I fear with little success, to urge the view that the Turk, however much controlled, &quot; should not be cut  up, but that the &apos; homeland of the Turkish race,&apos; including Constantinople &quot; and Adrianople, and of course Anatolia, should be left as one State under the sovereignty of &quot; the Sultan, with an  international  commission to  look after his  finances and exercise  such &quot; general supervision as might prevent any excessive oppression of non-Turkish minorities. &quot; 1 know this would be best for us in Egypt, and, I believe, in India.  I  think  it would  be &quot; best for us in the  whole of the Muslim East.&quot;    I  quote  this from an  absent colleague,  who, I  think  my colleagues will agree,  knowsmore of the Middle  East than any other member of the Government.     Finally, I would urge that much depends upon the form of. the peace.  Let us avoid anylanguage which would appear to presume to interfere with  the Khalifate or with the religiousobservances of Mohammedans and with the guardianship of their Holy Places from Adrianopleto Basra.     Let us, above,  all do  nothing  which would  appear  to put  us in opposition to  what Tconceive to  be a Mohammedan  ambition, the ultimate voluntary federation of  these greatMuslim countries as members of  the League of Nations a view which 1 understood in Pariswas not viewed unfavourably by Mr. Balfour.   Any expression of favour of this course would do something to soften the blow which the disappearance of the  last great MohammedanPower must inevitably produce.                                                                             E. S.  M.    18th December  1919.
