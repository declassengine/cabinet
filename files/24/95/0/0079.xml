(Signed)      GEORGE  N. BARNES.                                                           *    2, Whitehall  Gardens, S.W. 1.          December 30, 1.919.FIRST  INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE.   HELD  AT       WASHINGTON, D.C., OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 1919.                 REPORT BY THE BRITISH OFFICIAL DELEGATES.    1. The  Conference  began  under  somewhat  inauspicious  and  even  depressingcircumstances.   The United States Government, which had invited the Conference to washington, announced that it  could take no  part  in its  proceedings,- and it  wassuggested in official quarters that as the Treaty of Peace had not come into effect, theConference must regard itself as a purely informal gathering.   In the absence of any official representative of the United States, who would naturally have  been chosen to preside over the Conference, a difficulty at once  arose as to the choice of a President;but Mr. Wilson, to whom the question was submitted, intimated that while he had no desire to. interfere in any way, he saw no objection to the Secretary for Labour accepting the position and thought he would be the proper person  to be chosen.   The delegatestherefore appointed the Secretary the presiding officer;  he opened the proceedings andpresided  afterwards, as often as he could get away from his official duties, which at thetime  were extremely  onerous because of the miners&apos; strike.  There were at  the timeacute industrial disputes in the steel trade and at the docks as well  as in the coalregions.  In the minds of many prominent persons there seemed to be some apprehensionas to the effects which the holding  of the  Conference might  have on the industrial position  in the States.  The Senate was engaged daily in discussing reservations and amendments of the  Peace Treaty,  and some of the opponents of the Treaty professed ijoregard the Conference as a premonitory symptom of European intervention in Americanaffairs;   We  were  described as  Bolsheviks,  or extreme persons, and one Senatorsuggested that we should all be  deported !  We think it only due to the delegates to
say that  in  the circumstances they  exercised  great  restraint.   In  spite of muchprovocation and  many opportunities to retaliate,  no retaliatory word, so far as  we know, was publicly  said  by any  of  them.   They had  been invited there  by thePresident of  the United States to  discuss practical measures for the improvement oflabour conditions, and they proceeded with their work.     2. The Organising Committee,  which had been set up at Paris and which had been engaged in preparing  the  ground, had issued  three  Blue  Books  containing muchinformation collected from the Governments of the different countries and also drafts ofconventions or recommendations  on the subjects  to  be  dealt with.  The  Committee,with the assistance of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, had also in  Septemberdespatched its  Secretary (Mr. H. B. Butler, C.B., Assistant Secretary to  the  BritishMinistry of Labour)  and staff to Washington, and by the appointed day, in  the face of great difficulties, the Secretariat, with the assistance of the American Department otLabour, had arranged the necessary accommodation for the Conference, and organiseda staff.   Great credit is due to them for their work.     3. The Conference opened on the &apos;29th October and  terminated its labours on the29th  November.   In its early sessions  it discussed the  question which  had been referred to it by  the Supreme Council  at  Paris of the admission of Germany and austria to the Conference  and membership of the  International  Labour Office, and decided in favour of their admission in  anticipation of their admission to the League.Owing, however, to difficulties about transport (due to a strike of longshoremen  in new york, which prevented the clearance of vessels plying between New York and  neutral ports), the Governments of Germany and  Austria were unable to  despatch delegateswith any  reasonable prospect of their being in time to take part in the proceedings.  Incommunicating that fact, however, they expressed appreciation of the invitation havingbeen extended to them.     4. A communication was also  received from  the Australian Government  statingthat the Labour Party in that country  had declined to appoint delegates, and  that, asa  consequence, Australia would not  take part.   New Zealand also  failed to senddelegates.  Canada,  South  Africa and India sent  representatives, so that  there werefour British  Empire delegations.  They included the  Minister  of Labour and thePresident of  the Privy Council in the  Canadian  Government, as well as other strongrepresentatives from all the three overseas dominions mentioned.     5. There were forty-one countries  represented.   They included (in addition toGreat Britain, Canada, India and South  Africa) France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, Poland,Czecho-Slovakia, Holland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Roumania,  Greece,Serbia, Spain, Portugal, China, Persia and Siam, and most of the States of  South and central America.     6. Finland, which had  asked  to  be  admitted to the  Conference though  not included among the States mentioned in the annexe  of  the  Covenant of the League,was also admitted.   In  connection  with its inclusion the question was raised of theright of the Conference to admit countries to membership of the  Labour Organisation,irrespective of  membership of the League  of Nations.   Some of the delegates urgedthat the Labour Organisation should be independent of the League, and proposed thatFinland should be admitted  to  full membership  of  the Organisation  at once.  Thisview, which in our opinion is contrary  to  the plain meaning of the Treaty, was not accepted.   The Conference adopted a compromise resolution, admitting  Finland to theWashington Conference without prejudice.   This was in  accordance with the authority given by the  Supreme Council at Paris.   It differs from the  decision  in the  case  of ex-enemy countries which, again in conformity with authority from  Paris, admits thosecountries to full membership of the Labour Organisation.     7. A feature to be noted, and which reveals a future danger to be guarded against,if possible, is  the large number of small States from Central  and South  America whichsent delegates, and  the disproportionate degree  of power  which they may exercise.They were inclined to act as a block, and some of them put forward impossible proposals and voted without much sense of responsibility.   They might easily be induced to vote for extreme proposals which could not be accepted by  Governments, and the conference would thereby lose moral authority.     8. Employers&apos; and workmen&apos;s  delegates each  formed separate  groups, had their special meetings and voted sectionally as a rule.   This was of course quite in accordancewith the constitution, and had been  anticipated; but the fact, nevertheless, should  benoted.   It is  but fair to say that the British representatives on occasions voted  against their groups notably in one instance, when Mr.  Stuart-Bunning, representing  british labour, voted against the majority of the labour representatives in the Conference.
     9. The Conference  on  the  final vote  adopted  six  draft  Conventions, and  sixRecommendations.    The Conventions deal respectively with         (1.) The eight hours day    forty-eight hours week in industry.  (Adopted by 82 votes               to 2.)        (2.) Unemployment                Communication to the Labour Office periodically of information!  ^0^g^               Establishment of free public employment agencies    ,.      ..  \  votes               Reciprocity in regard to unemployment insurance    ..      .. J   to 4.        (3.) Restrictions  on  employment  of women in industry and  commerce before  and               after childbirth, and provision for mother and child.  (Adopted  by 67 votes               to 10.)        (4.) Prohibition of employment of  women in  industry during  the night.  (Adopted               by 94 votes to 1.)        (5.) Prohibition of employment of  children in industry under 14 years.  (Adopted by 91               votes to 3.)        (6.) Prohibition of employment of young persons under 18 years at night in industry.               (Adopted by 93 votes unanimously.)    The Recommendations deal respectively with         (1.) Unemployment                Prohibition of private employment agencies.  (78 votes to 9.)               Restriction on recruiting of foreign workers.  (60 votes to 24.)               Establishment of a system  of unemployment insurance. (73 votes to 11.)               Regulation of the distribution of public work.  (83 votes to 4.)        (2.) Reciprocity with regard to treatment of foreign workers.  (80 votes to 9.)        (3.) Unhealthy industries. Disinfection  of wool infected  with anthrax.  (95 votes               unanimously.)        (4.) Unhealthy industries. Regulation of employment of women  and young persons in               lead industries.  (91 votes unanimously.)        (5.) Unhealthy industries. Establishment of Government medical service for factories.               (92 votes unanimously.)        (6.) Adoption of Berne Convention on use of white phosphorus in match manufacture.               (92 votes unanimously.)It will be seen that all the draft  conventions and  recommendations  now submitted were carried  by more than the two-thirds majority of the  delegates,  which  under the treaty is made a condition of the adoption of a convention or recommendation.   If the treaty had been  in  force and  the  League  of Nations  fully  constituted, it would now  beobligatory on  the part  of  the  Secretary-General to  forward the  conventions  andrecommendations to all the affiliated Governments, and it would also become  obligatoryon such Governments to submit the conventions and recommendations to their competent authority.   But ratifications have not yet been exchanged,  and the  neutral  countries are allowed two months after such ratification  within which to  signify  adherence  to  theLeague.  It  will, be necessary therefore to regularise the  Washington  proceedings, aftersuch ratification and adherence,  and it is proposed to take counsel  with the Leagueauthorities as  to the best means  by which this  may  be done.  A further meeting ofthe Conference may be necessary for  the purpose of passing a  series  of confirmingresolutions.     10. For the above and other  executive work it  was necessary to set up tentativelythe  Governing  Body  of the  International Labour   Office.   Great difficulty  wasexperienced  in reaching an agreement as  to  the  States by whom the twelve  official representatives should be appointed.   It  was  eventually decided by a large majoritythat the States should be Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, Belgium,  Spain,Switzerland,  Argentine, Canada and Poland, and, pending the  adhesion of the UnitedStates of America, Denmark.  India and China were not consenting parties and theirdissent  may entail a reference to the Council of the League.   Sir Malcolm Delevingne,one of  the undersigned,  undertook provisionally  to represent  Great Britain.    Theemployers&apos; and workmen&apos;s representatives, six  of each, were  chosen by the employers&apos;and workmen&apos;s delegates at the conference, in  accordance with the plan agreed to  at paris Mr. Stuart-Bunning being  included among  the  labour  representatives and SirAllan Smith  among.the employers&apos; representatives.    11. At  the first meeting  of the  Governing Body, M.  Fontaine,  of France,  wasprovisionally  elected as chairman.  The  labour delegates pressed for the immediate
 appointment of the Director of the International Labour Office, and proposed M. Albert Thomas, of France.  This was objected to by a number of representatives as premature, and the  proposal was not carried.   A motion, however, to appoint him provisional Director, pending the formal  constitution  of the  Governing  Body, was carried by a narrow majority.  The British  delegates, in view  of the  fact of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations having been selected  from Great  Britain, felt themselves precluded from putting forward a candidate of their own ; but  they think it essential that, in the selection of Deputy Director and the other chief officials of the  Office, a fair representation of Great Britain and the other chief industrial nations should be secured.     12. Unverified statements having been made as to American conditions of labour, upon which it  was necessary to get accurate information, we despatched  Mr. Isaac Mitchell to  adjacent places to get such information at first hand.  He subsequently, and for the same reason, undertook a  more  extended  tour, and  the report thereof will be sent to the  Minister of Labour.  The ground, however,  is only partly covered, and we believe that a distinct service would be  rendered British industry if a full commission were sent to America to study recent developments in American industrial methods and conditions.   Visits were  also  made  to various  industrial  centres  by  the  technical advisers from the Home Office, who will report to their Department.     13.  A great deal is being done to  encourage  industrial efficiency in  the United States.  Many employers  have inaugurated  schemes of industrial, and  even social, welfare on a grand scale.  Special attention is also being  paid to  the laying-out of plant,  costing, and kindred matters.   A special profession of industrial engineering has been brought into being for the purpose of advising on the best lay-out of plant,  and the  co-ordination  of  factory processes.  We believe  that  in  some  cases  social  and industrial welfare  is  being run as an alternative or antidote  to  trade-unionism, and, although in our judgment there is no prospect of solving labour problems on that line, still there is no doubt that the better organisation of plant and the provision of amenities for workpeople tend to stabilise labour in particular factories  or industries, and give the workers an interest in such industries, and that therefore production is greatly increased as a result.   The question of its bearing upon the  labour problem in its larger aspect is not here beinir considered.   All that we want  to call attention to  is the fact that it               O is being done, and that the productivity of labour is  in  the  meantime being increased, and  possibly may be  increased to our detriment, unless we  take  some steps, to stimu- late the interest of workmen by some means consistent or appropriate  to our conditions. We think that there is everything to gain by knowing all  about  these schemes  and then having them discussed;  and we believe that  our superior  organisation would enable us readily to adopt any of them found to be transportable.     14.  We append herewith printed copies of the conventions and recommendations.* We think it right to put on record the very efficient  manner in which our  colleagues generally performed the work entrusted to them.   Most of the work was first prepared in committees or commissions  and no less than  six  of  these  were  presided over by British representatives,  each of whom had  first  to  guide  his or her  committee or commission  and then to defend its findings on  the floor  of the Conference.    Thearrangements made for the replacement of delegates by expert advisers when speciallytechnical subjects were under discussion worked quite  satisfactorily.  Opportunity  wasafforded the women advisers of putting their case on the floor of the Conference, as wellas in committee, when matters specially affecting women were under discussion.     15.  We have no hesitation in saying that the Conference, in spite of the abstentionof the  United States of America, was a great success.   It kept  its feet, on motherearth.   Its  findings  are on  the whole practical,  and such  as  can be  adopted by governments in the near future.     16., Before the conclusion of its sittings, there appeared to be a change  in american public  opinion in regard  to  it, and a desire in  Government  circles to pay it someattention a desire, however, which came too late to eventuate in any practical shape.
