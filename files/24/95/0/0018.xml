DEPARTMENTAL.The National Scheme for the Employment of Disabled Men.                  ,    The  three months&apos;  experience of the operation  of  the National Scheme for  theemployment of disabled men on a percentage basis has shown that, though progress maybe regarded as satisfactory, it has been gradual, and is likely to continue so in the future.Labour troubles during the period have proved a somewhat serious  obstacle, and at the   (0 1942) 255  12/19  H &amp; S                                                 3 X
 present  time  the ironmoulders&apos;  strike is  unquestionably  affecting  progress to  a  very perceptible extent.  Apart, however, from such difficulties, full success will obviously be obtained only by steady and prolonged effort on the part of the Ministry.   On the 5th November the number of  firms who  had adopted the scheme, and  whose undertakings had been accepted as satisfactory by the Local Employment Committees, was a little over 9,000, while 984 undertakings were still  awaiting consideration and acceptance  by the Local Employment Committees.   The  firms  whose  undertakings  had  been  accepted employed in all  about a million and a quarter workpeople,  of whom over 76,000  were disabled men.  The main difficulty arises from the fact that the great majority of these firms already  employ disabled men to  the full extent required by the scheme.  Thus, of the first 8,000 firms, 6,916 have already carried out  their obligation, and the number of disabled men  required  by  the remaining 1,084 firms to complete their quota is  a  little under 3,000.  This fact is evidence of the consideration already shown by many firms to the class of men for whom their aid has been asked, and to the earlier efforts of the Ministry of  Labour to  watch over the interests of the disabled.  But it leaves for the Ministry a very considerable task in persuading a wider acceptance of the scheme.  The point may be  illustrated  by a consideration of the  figures for the week ending the 5th December. During that week undertakings were accepted from 403 firms who employed over 85,000 workpeople, but the number of disabled men required to complete the quota of these firms was only 113.   The number of disabled ex-Service men on the registers of the Employment Exchanges in  Great Britain was 37,825 on the 29th  November.   During the week,  over 2,000 fresh registrations occurred, and the number on the register at the close of the week was 36,603.  This reduction, though substantial, cannot safely be accounted for  by the supposition  that  all the disabled men concerned had  obtained employment.  It is  known that  1,419 men were placed by the Exchanges, but the number of lapsed or  cancelled applications was large.     In these circumstances special interest attaches to the measures taken by the Ministry to keep the scheme prominently before the mind of employers.   This is of necessity  largely a matter  of local effort.  In the North-Western Division, for example, it was found that employers were,  for the most part, not taking action on the recommendations  of the National  Trade Advisory Committees and other bodies which had been consulted, but were waiting for a declaration of policy on the part of their local federations.  Negotiations were therefore opened at once with the headquarters  of the various federations  in the division, and arrangements were made for a deputation from the divisional office to  attend the next meeting of each of these bodies.   The result has been that the majority of the federations have  already promised to accept the scheme  for their industries, and an energetic  canvass among employers is being carried out on the strength of these  recom- mendations.  Press publicity is being widely used to keep the scheme to the forefront. In  the South Midlands and Eastern Division, and in the Yorkshire  and East Midlands Division, for example, much use has been made of this method.  Illustrated articles showing the possibilities of employment of disabled  men have  appeared, and editorial attention has been generously given to the scheme.   The list of employers on the King&apos;s  National Roll has now reached dimensions sufficient to warrant the production of the list as a small brochure, and  steps are being taken to carry this  out.  Further attention may thus be attracted to the scheme.  The fact remains, however, that a personal canvass of employers seems necessary if complete success is to be ensured.  The amount of work entailed upon the local officials of the Ministry, now and in the future, must be very considerable.    Public authorities are, on the whole, accepting the scheme with considerable readiness,and in one or two cases are going beyond a mere acceptance of the scheme as regards their own employees.   The Leeds City Council have resolved that except by a special resolution of the Council, their municipal contracts  shall be placed only with persons or firms  whohave adopted the National Scheme.                           PART III. PRESS COMMENTS.                         (1) The Labour and Socialist Press.The Prime Ministers Manchester Speech,    The Prime Ministers speech in Manchester on Saturday, the 6th December, is  theprincipal topic of discussion in  this week&apos;s papers, all of which are vitally interested inthe references in the speech to  the  Labour movement.  The criticism  of  the  &quot; NewStatesman &quot; is the most moderate. This  paper agrees with the Prime Minister that, in
 the present state of parties in Great Britain, a coalition Government of some kind is- inevitable.   It is claimed that the Labour Party may well be the largest single party in the House of Commons, but the &quot; New Statesman &quot; acknowledges that the Labour Party is not likely for many years to come to secure an independent majority.  It is argued that a Liberal-Labour coalition is at least a tolerable thing, and need not involve any dishonest compromise. This  opinion of the &quot;New Statesman&quot; is not remarkable in  view of its recent arguments in favour of Mr. Asquith and its somewhat conservative adherence to the two-party system,  but it is an opinion not shared by any other Labour  or Socialist paper.  The localT.L.P. papers the &quot; Leeds Weekly Citizen,&quot; the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer,&quot; and the &quot; Bradford  Pioneer &quot; have no such solicitude for the future of the Liberal Party, and join in emphasising their opinion that the principle at issue  between the Labour movement  and the Government  has  now  been declared to be  that of  nationalisation. Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; foresees that this struggle for nationalisation will be a long and bitter one, but he has no doubt that it will be successful.   In view of the opinions expressed by the I.L.P. leaders in the spring and summer, that there would be a general election in the autumn, it is noteworthy  that Mr.  Ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; expresses a hope that there will be no general election before the 1920 Budget statement.   &quot; We must know what the Governments financial proposals are,  because when,  we have them  our case will be complete.&quot;  The &quot; Socialist &quot; welcomes  the speech- as it has welcomed the cessation of the civilian out-of-work donation in the hope that it may make the issues of the class-war clearer to the proletariat.  Mr. R. B. Suthers, in the &quot;  Clarion,&quot; firm, believer as he is in the dogmas&apos;of nationalisation, adopts an attitude substantially similar to that of the local I.L.P. papers. Trades Union Congress.     The special Trades Union Congress, which met on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 9th and 10th December, occurred too late in the week for full comment in these papers. The &quot; New  Statesman &quot; acknowledges that the discussion  on the nationalisation of the mines was somewhat uninspiring, but points out that if an immediate decision upon action had been necessary, the &quot; political actionists &quot; and  &quot; direct actionists &quot; would probably have quarrelled.   &quot; Justice &quot; is in full agreement with the decision of the  Congress  that further propaganda is needed,  and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, in. &quot; Forward,&quot; enters into a panegyric of the use of the platform (as  opposed to  the press) as a  means of influencing public opinion.   The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; is attracted by the speeches of Messrs. Smillie and Mann  rather than by those of Messrs. Thomas and Clynes. It does not, however,, profess to contemplate revolution with complacency,  and suggests that the obvious course is to consult the electorate on the issue of nationalisation.  The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; notes  with pleasure that  these references to &quot; direct action &quot; were not  enthusiastically applauded  by  the  Congress.   The &quot; New Statesman&quot; and &quot; Justice&quot;  welcome the M.F.G.B. Memorandum on Prices and Profiteering, though they  recognise its limitations. The &quot; New  Age &quot; is profoundly critical  of the whole performance  of the Congress.  In particular the resolution on prices and profiteering is criticised.  This paper maintains that the Congress  was wrong in  attributing so much  importance to the  element of &quot; profiteering,&quot; and was wrong also in not attempting to act in  the  matter on behalf of the whole people, rather than on behalf of the organised workers  alone.  With regard to nationalisation, it is suggested that a profound change of opinion  has taken place, and the machinery  of the Labour movement is criticised for not making  possible a corresponding change in the officially advocated policies. Food  Control.     The decision of the Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress to support the abolition of food control arouses much attention in these papers.  The &quot; New States- man &quot; observes  that the decision has created consternation in many  sections of the Co-operative movement, and points out that local  co-operative societies,  many of thev rational leaders of the movement and its direct representatives on the Consumers&apos; Council of the Food Ministry are keen advocates of the continuance of the  control.  The movement for  de-control within the co-operative movement  has indeed come from the wholesale side of the  co-operative organisation.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; expresses  sympathy with the motives which  have led the wholesale societies to be dissatisfied with the present control, but maintains that experience gained during the war has shown conclusively that maximum retail prices, which are supported by the wholesale societies,  are  utterly un- workable Bxcept on the basis of a complete system of control.  This paper advocates the retention and reform of food control, rather than its abolition.     (C 1942)                                                              3X2
     Mr. H. M. Hyndman, in &quot; Justice,&quot; deals with the question in his usual manner and appeals in the name of the Consumers&apos; Council  to all working class organisations to work together  in opposition to the movement for de-control.  The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; devotes special attention to the  question of milk prices  and voices a demand for the creation of great public service devoted to the duty of producing milk for the people. International Labour Conference.     The  proceedings of the Washington International Labour Conference are dealt with this week in the &quot; Nation.&quot;  The bulk of the article is devoted to an outline of the decisions of the Conference, and of the permanent organisation which it has put into working order. The &quot; Nation &quot; is, however, deeply interested in the political aspects of the  Conference rather than in its Labour aspects.   It thinks that the Conference shows the usefulness of comparatively popular assemblies in the League of  Nations scheme,  and  expresses the opinion that a number of semi-popular bodies, after the fashion of the Labour Conference, each discussing different problems, might become effective instruments for modifying the bureaucratic  character of the League of Nations.   &quot; It looks  as if regularly recurrent conferences of this kind  might enable workers of all countries to collect and organise their stand in such a way as to break down the dangerous monopoly  of politicians and officials in the government of the League of Nations.&quot; Railways.     The Minister of  Transports announcement^ with reference  to the agreement arrived at with the N.U.R. and A.S.L.E. &amp; P., regarding the reconstruction of the railway concilia- tion machinery,  does not attract much attention.   The comments of, the   &quot;Railway Review &quot; (12th inst.) on the white paper dealing with the financial results of the Government Control of the Railways are, however,  of interest.   The  &quot; Railway Review &quot; expresses a doubt as to the trustworthiness of the figures and  an opinion that if opportunity were given of checking the figures, the Government estimates might be amended considerably. The particular criticism made is that  the value to the State of  the conveyance of troops and war material has been seriously under-estimated. Cotton Textile Industry.     The movement  that has been  proceeding now in this industry for many months, in the way of re-organisation and re-capitalisation, continues to attract the attention of the *&apos; Cotton  Factory Times,&quot; and its correspondents.  The  bulk of the  correspondence published is noticeably hostile to the changes that are taking place.  The fear is  constantly expressed that the operatives in any new demands for increased wages may be met with the argument that the industry  cannot support  any further wage increases, owing to the necessity  for earning a reasonable rate of interest on the greatly enhanced values of the cotton mills.  A suggestion is made in some cases that the operatives should terminate all wage agreements immediately and should demand increased wages on the strength of the profits that are being made in these cotton mill sales.   The &quot; New Statesman &quot; discusses the matter in a special article and  endorses these operatives&apos; complaints and fears : &quot; A huge new claim upon the industry by the owning classes will have been established.&quot;  The only solution, however, that this paper can suggest is that the cotton industry should  be nationalised, but it  is recognised that nationalisation after the  re-capitalisation process has been  completed  would be a  very difficult  operation to  carry through,  owing to  the necessity for  buying out the proprietors  of the industry at inflated prices.  The &quot; New Statesman &quot; is thus led to utter a thought which might well have been expressedin the  &quot; New Age.&quot;   &quot; The hand of  finance lies heavy on industry and on the public ; anduntil that hand is  removed the standard of life of the workers by hand and brain will  be menaced and an effective obstacle will be interposed in the way  of any substantial fall in the cost of living.&quot;   The  &quot; New Statesman,&apos;&apos; however, does not show any approach to the logical insight into the intricacies of finance which is displayed by the other paper, and doesnot appear to  appreciate  how much of  this re-capitalisation process results in profits more apparent on paper than real in fact. The International Situation.     Foreign politics excite more than usual attention in this week&apos;s papers.  The &quot; labour leader &quot; is convinced that France is responsible for the delay in the ratification of the PqaceTreaty.  In a long article on the subject, Mr. E. D.  Morel says  that it is the aim  of                         * In the House of Commons, 8th December.
M. Clemenceau and the &quot; jingoes &quot; to keep the German race in economic and political servitudefor an indefinite period.   The question is asked why France is allowed to pursue her vindic-tive policy without a protest from her own Socialists or from the International; and it isprophesied that &quot; the Socialist International will collapse, and deservedly collapse, unless it can do something to justify its existence.&quot;Russia.     The Government^ policy with regard  to  Eussia rouses strong resentment in the&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; and &quot; The Call.&quot;   Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, in  the former paper,urges that a rank and file conference should be held, which, besides demanding recognitionof the Soviet Government and non-intervention in Eussia, should pass a resolution callinga general strike and pass a vote of censure on the Executives of the Trades Union Congress,the  Triple Alliance and  the Labour  Party for not  having taken  similar  action.  In  Forward,&quot;  &quot; Eob Roy &quot; writes on &quot; Economic Bolshevism,&quot; and, taking his facts  fromthe articles on &quot; The Nationalisation of Industry in Soviet Russia,&quot; by M. Issaiev, appearing in &quot; Justice,&quot; and  from an article in the  &quot; Fortnightly Review,&quot; by Mr. R. Crozier on&quot;&quot; Industrial Nationalisation,&quot; he shows how the first attempts at self-government in the nationalised industries resulted in absolute confusion, involving the Government in immenselosses.  As it was impossible for the Government to hand the industries  over to private ownership, owing to the treatment which had been meted out to capitalists and  experts,it was constrained to adopt a more methodical nationalisation policy,  with the result that now the workers are placed under the strictest discipline, and, in  the words of Lenin,  &quot; theRevolution, in its own interests and in those of  Socialism, now  demands  the  unqualifiedsubmission of the working-man to the directors  of all  undertakings.&quot;                        ,  (2) Ex-Service  Metis Periodicals.                                       Nil.                             PART IV-GENERAL TOPICS. The General Situation.     As compared with last week, the present  one has been comparatively uneventful. It was noted last week that the  importance of the Special Trades Union Congress was that it  defined  clearly  the  attitude of Labour upon certain  matters.   At countless meetings all over the country during the next few months, it may be anticipated that these clearly defined dogmas will be absorbed by the mass of  the Labour  movement.  This crystallisation of official Labour opinion, however, it should be noted, may in all proba- bility, be followed by an antagonistic unofficial movement.   Steps are being taken, noted elsewhere in this Report, to strengthen the  organisation of the N.U.R. District Councils.as against the Executive of the Union, and the National  Administrative Committee of Shop Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees  intend to hold  a National conference  on the 10th and 11th January, 1920, with a view  to  strengthening the so-called rank and file movement., Coal Industry (Emergency) Bill.     With  reference to the decision  of the M.F.G.B.  to  oppose  the  Coal  Industry (Emergency) Bill, it is interesting to note the report  that  there was a sharp  conflict of opinion on the question at the meeting of the  Miners&apos; Executive,  and that the decision was taken on a majority of one.   There was no opposition to the principle of the limita- tion of profits;  but it  is  obvious from opinions  recently  expressed,  that the miners&apos; leaders are divided on the, subject of coal-control.   Mr. Brace has emphatically expressed the  view that he would prefer the absolute removal of control to the continuance of the present system.  The Northumberland and Durham  miners are restive owing to their appreciation of the fact that on present prices  for coal, their sliding scale wages would have been higher than present rates.   Mr.  Straker has recently issued a circular pointing out  that from the date of receipt  of the national war  wage up to the present year,  they have been receiving wages greater than they would have received under the sliding scale. On the 15th ult. Mr. F. Hodges dealt specifically with this question, laying great stressupon the continuance of the national method of settling wage questions and objecting to
 the policy of increasing wages in areas of abnormal profits.   Mr. Hartshorn also argues: that the restoration of free enterprise would make National wage rates impossible, the1 difference of productivity between  the richer and poor mines being so pronounced that only by a system of control whereby the poorer mines can be kept at work out of the&apos; profits of the industry as a whole, can these rates be maintained. Unemployment Insurance.     It  is expected that the  Governments proposals with regard to the  extension of Unemployment.Insurance will receive a first reading this session, and then be postponed until the  coming year, in order that the scheme may be  discussed with the interested parties. , Labour opinion is crystallising around the principle of placing upon each industry the legal obligation of  maintaining its  own unemployed,  and of administering the unemployment  funds through the trade unions.  Precedents for this plan are found in. the arrangements  made under the  Cotton Control scheme for provision for unemploy- ment and short time. Forty-Eight Hour Bill.     Reference  was made  to the  difficulty  with regard  to  the constitution  of  the employers&apos; side of the  conferences which  have been  considering  the  inclusion  ofs agriculture in this  Bill,* at the annual general meeting of the Council of the Central and Associated Chambers  of  Agriculture, which  was held on  the 10th inst.  A resolution hostile  to the inclusion of agricultural workers in the Bill was passed, and a small repre- sentative committee appointed to meet the landlords&apos; and the farmers&apos; representatives in the  matter.  It was also decided at this meeting to ask the Agricultural Committee of the House of Commons to receive a deputation from the Central Chamber on the Bill, and to  invite the other  agricultural  employers&apos;  bodies to support the  deputation.  The first meeting of the campaign organised by  the joint committee of all sections of the mercantile  marine  to secure the inclusion of  officers and men in the Bill  was held in Liverpool on the 12th inst.   It is reported that  the meeting was a large one,  and that the speakers were  enthusiastically received.   A resolution was passed protesting against the proposed exclusion of merchant seamen  from the Bill,  and  drastic action was threatened if these men  find themselves excluded.  In  connection with the  desire of seamen to secure greater leisure, it is of interest to  note that a conference was held at the Jordans&apos; Hostel, Beaconsfield, on the 13th and 14th inst., to discuss a scheme for providing educational  facilities  on  board  ships and at ports of calling.  Proposals were outlined for the extension to the  mercantile marine of the same facilities for adult education  as are now provided in the Army ;  and were readily  accepted by the repre- sentatives of seamens&apos;  unions who  were present.  The conference was held under the auspices of the  World  Association  for Adult  Education, and presided over by  Mr.  C. Vaughan, ex-premier of South Australia.     On  the 4th December the Minister  received a deputation representing employers in the chemical, gas, blast furnace and steel trades who asked for an exemption of certain trades where processes most continue without interruption,  or where some men must be employed continuously, from the operation of the Bill.  It was suggested to the deputation that the question  should be  discussed through Joint Industrial Councils  or similar machinery. Engineers and the 44-Hour  Week    The Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades  Federation  have now appointed a com- mittee of six to co-operate with an  equal  number of representatives of the  Engineering and Shipbuilding Employers&apos;  Federation in the investigation  of  the economic effect  of a  44-hour  week in these  industries. The workers&apos; representatives will be :  Mr.  J. T. Brownlie (A.S.E.), chairman, Mr.  John  Hill  (boilermakers), Mr.  W. F. Dawtrey  (steam engine makers),  Mr. J.  Rowan (E.T.U.), Mr. J. E. Davison, M.P. (Friendly Society of Ironfounders), and Mr. J. W. Paterson (Amalgamated Society  of Carpenters and Joiners). It is considered probable that the committee will visit the United States to study the effect of the.introduction  of the 44-hour week in American shipyards.   The setting up of a joint committee should also make it easier for the two sides to resume negotiations on other questions, including the standardisation of wages  by the incorporation  of war advances,payment by results and the whole problem of apprenticeship and unapprenticed boylabour.* Of. Eeport, 10th December, p. 471-2.
Tim Railways.    The settlement  between the  Railway Unions and the  Government has been  thesubject of certain complaints as far as the representation arrangements of the advisory board are concerned, chiefly on the ground that representatives  of the  parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Union in no way represent&apos;&quot; users of railways,&quot; but that they represent primarily labour interests which haye alreadyadequate representation  on the Board. The scheme has also been attacked in  anotherquarter by  a  conference of the Central Counties  and London District Councils of  theN.U.R., which was held  under the  auspices  of the London District Council on the 12thDecember.   This conference was called to  discuss the future control of the railways.Mr. 0. T. Cramp, Mr. G. D. H. Cole, Mr. W. W. Craik, of the Central Labour College,  andMr. Mellor,  Industrial Editor of the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; spoke.  All inclined to the viewthat the official scheme was undemocratic in conception, and Mr. Cole, describing it as&quot; faked control,&quot; advised the railwaymen to refuse to serve on the  Board, as  a smallmeasure of control might endanger their demands for their real object the control of thewhole industry  by those engaged in it.  Mr. Cramp  promised that  if the railwaymenfound their  position on the Board detrimental to the  best interests of the N.U.R. theywould resign as the miners had done.   In connection with the demand of the rank  and file for greater control, it may be noted that a scheme for federating the District councils of the N.U.R.  has been outlined.   This is intended to co-ordinate the activities  of the council&apos;s and to improve their position  in the event of a strike.  The leading spirit in  this movement is Mr. W. T. A. Foot,  who organised the  Central  Strike  Committee duringthe railway strike.    With regard to the rumours that a &quot;lightning strike&quot;  would  take place  on  therailways about Christmas time, Mr. J.  H.  Thomas, speaking at Swansea last week, repu-diated such suggestions and stated that it was manifestly unfair  to the union and  pre-judicial to the negotiations with the Government that such rumours should be circulated.It is now considered practically certain that Mr. C. T.  Cramp, the  present President,  willbe elected to the new post of Industrial Secretary of the N.U.R.The Christmas Holidays.     The general tendency to close down  for a considerable period at Christmas time isvery  noticeable this year.  The majority of the large shops in the West End and elsewherehad announced their intention  of granting their employees a holiday  from ChristmasDay  until the following  Monday before the  declaration of Saturday, the  27th December,a Bank Ploliday.  This is  probably largely due to the efforts of Captain A. Laxking,Secretary of the  Early Closing Association.  In  some cases employees  have  informedtheir employers that they will refuse to work on Christinas Day,  and it  is reported  that considerable discontent  exists among  London waitresses on account of  the extra workentailed by Christmas for which they do not receive extra wages.  It is suggested  thattheir grievance may be  met by granting  double pay to waitresses who  will be  on dutyeither on the 25th or 26th December.   Some of the  more important London papers havealso decided to suspend publication for  two days this year, among them being the &quot; MorningPost&quot; and &quot; Daily News.&quot;  The tramways under the control of the Bradford and Hudders-field  Corporations will suspend operations  on Christmas Day, and a movement  in thisdirection is reported from Birmingham,  Manchester and Salford. Rousing,     The Prime Minister addressed a specially convened meeting  of the  Building Trades  .National Joint  Industrial Council on Tuesday the 16th inst., at the Central Hall, West-minster.  The Minister of Labour presided  over the meeting.  The Prime Minister dealtwith each of five things which he said  were essential to the  building  of houses sites,cash, material, transport and labour.   With reference to  the  shortage of labour it was calculated that there were from 200,000 to 250,000 fewer men in the building trades  than before the war.   The building trade must therefore draw new recruits to its colours. From 20,000 to 30,000 of building trades men would be released from the army in the course ofthe next few weeks.  The Prime Minister  insisted that every step was being taken in order to prevent  the  exploitation of the national need for unreasonable profit.  His appeal on this  matter of labour shortage was that the Council should see whether  something could not be done to introduce quickly and rapidly into the building trade as many new recruits as the labour market made available.  Some  discussion took place  at  the close of the address and the hostility of the operatives to anjr scheme  of dilution was expressed, and their fear of prolonged unemployment and hard times on the cessation of  the  present
 housing boom.  The Prime Minister, in reply, stated that they did not propose dilution of the industry with unskilled workmen  in the ordinary sense, but suggested that the term&apos; of apprenticeship should be shortened and men-too old  for apprenticeship-should be taken on  as &quot;improvers&quot; with a,  view to becoming skilled.  The meeting eventually agreed that the Resettlement Committee of the Council should augment itself by suitable co-option  and  deal with the  matter. Labour in Municipal Politics.     In addition to the activities of Borough  Councils in favour of the  Police Union (see Report, 3rd December, p. 456), three new developments of labour municipal policy may be noted.   A conference convened by the&apos; Joint Committee of the Co-operative Union,. the London Labour  Party, the London.  Trades Council and the Workers&apos; Educational Council on the 13th inst. discussed working-class views on the application of the Education Act of 1918 to the London area.  Mi&apos;.&apos; Herbert Morrison, Mr. Mactavish, Mr. G. Lansbury and Miss M. Macarthur addressed the meeting.   A general resolution was passed in favour of an education which secured to all children, irrespective of their parents&apos; income or social status,  equal and complete opportunities  for mental, moral and physical development.. The detailed recommendations of the conference were for an adequate number of nursery schools, progressive reduction of the  size of classes,  provision of adequate dental and medical  treatment  for children, adequate  maintenance allowances for children over 12,. grants and classes  for -the development of adult education, and  an improvement in the status and prospects of the teaching  profession.     It is reported  that the Bermondsey Borough Council has revoked the appointments of the old council to the local  Profiteering Committee and has appointed new members.     The Poplar Borough Council intends to extend advances in rates of wages, as deter- mined by industrial awards and by agreements between trade unions and employers&apos; asso- ciations, to those of its employees only who are trade unionists or who join a trade union within four weeks.  The object of this policy is obviously to  compel the borough employees to  join  their respective  unions. The &quot; Daily Herald.&quot;     With reference to the publicity campaign of the &quot; Daily Herald &apos;&quot; for financial support (see Report, 10th December,  No. 473), it is announced that nearly 200 Development Committees are now at work.  These committees are conducting a Christmas-box campaign. in support of the &quot; Herald.&quot; Mines Nationalisation.     Demonstrations in  support of  the mines nationalisation campaign are reported at Annesley (Notts), Pontefract (Yorks), and in Camberwell.  It is reported that at Caerphilly a meeting passed a resolution protesting against the nationalisation of the mines. LLP. Policy.     A memorandum on &quot; Socialism and Government &quot; has been prepared by the National Administrative  Council of the  I.L.P. for submission to  the Geneva International Socialist Congress of 1920.  The  memorandum is of importance because it outlines the considered opinion of one of the constituent bodies of the Labour Party on three  subjects of great importance-the English Parliamentary System, the  Russian  Soviet Government, and Direct Action.  The memorandum rehearses the detailed criticisms which I.L.P. leaders have long been passing upon English Parliamentary institutions, and it is stated that &quot; in Great Britain, Parliamentary Government is more on  its trial to-day than ever since it was instituted.&quot;   The I.L.P. nevertheless affirms its belief in the root principles of modernpolitical  democracy.  &quot; The weakness  lies in  the bad education of democracy and the imperfect state of socialist propaganda.&quot;     &quot; The revealed weaknesses of democracy can be overcome only by persistent education and propaganda, and by the strenuous activities  of the Socialist and Labour groups in the various  Parliaments.&quot;   In the section of the memorandum dealing with the Soviet form of government the conclusions arrived at are that this system is not the best form for an &quot; industrial  democracy,&quot; and that it is a short-sighted policy to imitate the Bolsheviks because (a)  the facts are not  known in sufficient detail, (b) the Soviet system is itself undergoing changes, (c)  the conditions under which  it has been established are altogether abnormal.  On the question of &quot; direct action,&quot; the principle is laid down that &quot; c direct action&apos; for political purposes is essentially different from(direct action &apos; for industrial pur-poses, and that the risks of failure of the former are so great that its political practicability.
49377 is slight.&quot;  &quot; Direct action,&quot; it  is  asserted,  is  one  of  the modes  of  action  which the working-class movement may be compelled to use by the &quot; reaction,&quot; but it is not a mode of action which ought to be spontaneously adopted by the Labour and Socialist movement itself.  On each of these three points the policy of the I.L.P. is diametrically opposed to that of the B.S.P.  These two political bodies  have  some influence on the strictly trade union side of the Labour movement.  On each  of these three important matters they are pulling in opposite directions. Trade Union- Topics.     Scottish Painters  Society. An article on  &quot; Workers&apos; Control in the Painting Trade &quot; appears in the current number of this  society&apos;s Journal.   It is suggested that the  union should open workshops in some town as a &quot; Painters&apos; Guild,&quot; and that all the painters in the town should immediately leave their private employers to work for the Guild.     Federation  of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades. The Clyde  District Committee of the Federation have appointed a sub-committee to deal with the question of  non-union labour and generally  to improve trade union  discipline.   The committee is  to hold  a series of meetings on the subject  in each of the local shipbuilding yards.     Dock, Wharf, Riverside and  General Workers&apos; Union. In the current number of the &quot; Dockers&apos; Record.&quot; the organ of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union, there appear two examples of other  unions endeavouring to induce members of this  union to transfer their membership.  During a strike of men  employed on structural  work in the North Wales district, members  of the Building Trade Operatives&apos;  Society sought to entice the strikers away from the Dockers&apos; Union.  In the Devon and Cornwall district it is reported that attempts  are  being made to induce labourers to transfer to  the  Stone Masons&apos; Union.     Amalgamated Society of Carpenters,  Cabinet Makers and Joiners. The current number of the official organ of this Society contains two resolutions from the Hull district on the subject of the Government scheme for the training of fit ex-Service men, urging the society not to sanction the scheme, and even to refuse these men admittance to the society or to allow members to work in establishments where they are employed.  The journal publishes the results of the voting of the British  branches on the changes in the rules proposed by the General Council.  Proposals  to  raise funds  for educational purposes and to increase contributions  and benefits were defeated;  while proposals to increase the levy on behalf of Parliamentary candidates and  to increase the entrance fee received a majority of votes.    Assistant Clerks&apos; Association.-At the annual meeting of the Assistant Clerks&apos; Associa- tion on the 26th November a resolution was passed to the effect that assistant clerks in the Civil Service  would decline to undertake any service which would tend to weaken the position  of  the  strikers in future industrial disputes.  The question of registering the association as a Trade Union was referred to the Council for them to prepare a statement on the subject, after which the question will be submitted to a ballot of the members.    Shipping Clerical  Staffs&apos; Guild. It is stated that the Guild is negotiating with the Ministry of Labour  in connection with  the establishment, of- a Whitley Council  for the whole shipping industry.  The Guild wishes to have a Council for the clerical staffs imme- diately, as a counterpart to the National Maritime Board, pending the establishment of the Council for the whole industry.    National  Amalgamated  Union  of Shop  Assistants. The&quot; final  report  of  the sub- committee appointed to deal  with the question of amalgamation with the National Ware- house  and General Workers&apos; Union and the  Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees has been presented,  and it has been decided  to.call a  Special National Conference to discuss the subject on the 18th January, 1920.    Central London Postmen&apos;s Association. This association has decided to amalgamatewith the newly-formed Union of Post Office Workers.    Amalgamated Society of Toolmakers. At a special meeting of the general executive ofthis Society it was decided to take a fresh ballot on the question of amalgamation with theother engineering unions.  In the recent ballot, although a majority of votes were castin favour  of amalgamation, the total number  of members voting did not exceed the 50per cent,  as required by law.Ex-Service Men.    Labour Party and Ex-Service  Men. It is reported that the Labour Party has formedan Advisory Committee of  ex-Service and legal men  to deal with services and pensions.matters.

    The Internationale of Ex-Soldiers. The French Republican Association of Ex-Soldiers-an anti-militarist and anti-Parliamentary body of extreme views, has voted unanimouslyin favour of the &quot; Internationale of Ex-Soldiers,&quot; and instructed its central committee to summon a congress at which the societies and federations of ex-soldiers of all the belligerentnations shall unite to bury National animosities and proclaim the reconciliation of peoples.An appeal to ex-soldiers of Britain to accept the invitation was published in the  &quot; daily herald.&quot;                  PART  V.-DEPARTMENTAL AND &apos;DISTRICT REPORTS.

The  union have sub-mitted a proposal for the establishment of a  Joint Industrial Council for Jersey, and havesuggested the institution, in connection with such a Council, of panels  to deal with wagesand conditions  of  employment in Horticulture,  Agriculture, Transport,  Engineering,Building Trades and Distributive Trades, The position is a peculiar  one in view of thefact that none of the Acts from which the Department derive their powers of conciliation and arbitration apply to the Channel Islands.Joint  Industrial Councils Division.    Pottery. The  Research Committee on the 8th  December,  were informed by  the manufacturers&apos; Federation of the Federation^ proposals  as  regards welfare matters.*The Council will be asked to bring pressure to bear to have these proposals carried out in areasonable time.

Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield. Enfield  Employment  Committee draws  atten-tion to the  necessity  of providing alternative work at the Royal Small  Arms Factory,and has appointed a deputation to lay the question before the Minister.     Employment of Ex-Service Men. In connection with the National Scheme for theEmployment of Disabled Men, local committees are experiencing difficulty in adjudicatingupon applications from firms who are employing disabled men totalling more than 5 percent, of the male staff,  but less than the required percentage of the whole  staff.   It isreported at Kings  Cross that  126 undertakings from  employers  have  been  accepted.Poplar Employment Committee supported the proposal submitted by a  conference  of theCanning Town, Poplar and  Stratford joint sub-committees to the effect  that employers should  be compelled to furnish  periodical returns to the  local employment committees of the  number of staff employed, together with particulars of the number of  disabled ex-Service men.     Training. At a conference  of chairmen and vice-chairmen of joint  sub-committeesheld on the 2nd inst., a strong resolution was passed, expressing disappointment  at thenon-fulfilment of promises made  by the Government in regard to the training of disabledmen, demanding that the provision of training facilities should be expedited and expressing the view that the present unsatisfactory conditions would not be improved until, in additionto the training centres now or about to be  established, local facilities  for training wereutilised under  the supervision  of the  local  joint sub-committee.  A  deputation  wasappointed to wait upon  the Prime Minister to lay before him the views of the Conferenceon  this urgent  question. An offer has been received at Poplar to train  and employ 24ex-Service men in  the manufacture of domestic tinware, subject to  the provision  that a loan of  1,200 is  forthcoming  to  meet  the  cost of premises  and  machinery.  EnfieldCommittee are pressing for the immediate establishment of a fully equipped training centre at the Strand Union  Workhouse, Edmonton.  The London Building Trades Committeehave raised objections to the Y.M.C.A. scheme for the  training of  disabled men  in thejoinery trade, on the grounds that training should be in the hands of the State and not leftto private enterprise.South Midlands and Eastern.     Unemployment. -The live register for the week  ending the 28th November shows adecrease of  720.  Numerous discharges  are  still  taking  place from  the Army  OrdnanceDepot  at Colchester.   The number   on  the live  register  at  High Wycombe has con-siderably decreased owing to the end  of the  dispute in the  Furniture Trade.    Provision of Lodging Accommodation. The  Leicester  Employment Committee havedecided to circularise employers in Leicester suggesting the formation of a limited company to run hostels for the large  number of workers imported from other districts.South-Western.     Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 28th November shows atotal decrease of 16.    Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Trowbridge the Employment Committee havedecided to circulate to the principal employers and estate owners in the area  a list  of theunemployed disabled men.   It may be noted that this action has already been taken by several  committees, notably Bristol.
    Juvenile Employment. Bournemouth Women&apos;s Sub-Committee are pressing for theformation of a Juvenile Advisory Committee for Poole.    Discharged Apprentices. A conference on the question of discharged and suspendedapprentices  was held at  Cowes  on the 26th November at  which it  was suggestedthat a scheme might be evolved between the education authority, the trades unions andthe firms whereby part of the boys&apos; time could be spent in ordinary technical work and part for technical instruction.  This suggestion  was adopted and every effort is beingmade to bring it to a successful issue.   .    Cessation of Out-of-Work  Donation-A unanimous resolution was passed at a meetingof the Bristol Committee  calling for the allocation of  funds equal to the Out-of-WorkDonation to local authorities  for the employment of men on works of public utility.  Afurther resolution was passed requesting the Minister to call a conference of employment committees to discuss the whole question.  These resolutions are  being circulated to  allemployment  committees in the country.    General. The serious position of the china clay trade, owing to transport delays, hasbeen  slightly  mitigated latterly.  Bristol and Avonmouth  are affected by the traffic congestion, which is reflected  in the increase of unemployment.  The change-over which is taking place at Barnstaple  from ferro-concrete to iron and  steel  shipbuilding  is notimproving the  employment situation.   As soon, however, as materials can reach the.shipbuilders an increase in employment is more than probable.West Midlands.    Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the  28th  November shows atotal  decrease of 2,456.    Ironfounders&apos; Strike. The ironfounders&apos; dispute is now attracting increased attention.As an indication of the serious position in Smethwick, where naturally the dispute is muchdiscussed, the moulders on strike number 400, but the unemployed figure  reaches 4,000.In the large towns in the area the trades councils and other labour bodies are helping toraise funds.   The friction  between the Ironfounders&apos; Society and the General Workers&apos;Union is unabated.   At a mass meeting on the 7th inst. at West Bromwich, Messrs. Beard(Workers&apos; Union, President)  and Hallas  (Gas,  Municipal and General Workers&apos; Union)condemned the  strike policy of  the ironfounders, and  respecting the special point of difference stated that &quot; the unions were prepared to fight to the last breath and the lastpenny of the funds to maintain the right of any workman to join what union he chose.&quot;    Employment of Ex-Service Men. Stafford  Employment Committee  urge that theresults achieved by the voluntary scheme point to the need for a strong measure of com-pulsion.    Provision of Lodging  Accommodation. The  Smethwick  and Hereford employment committees  have decided  to  insert advertisements in the press asking householders to notify to the Exchange lodging accommodation.    Agricultural Sub-Committee.-At Hereford it  has been  decided  to  form a  specialagricultural  sub-committee of the Employment  Committee composed of representatives from  the Farmers&apos;  Union, the Hop Growers&apos;  and Fruit Growers&apos; Association and theWorkers&apos; Union to deal with  the  supply of agricultural  labour in the  Herefordshire area,and to consider the  advisability  of forming small  sub-committees for each office of the-Ministry in the county to advise and assist branch managers in this connection.Yorkshire and East Midlands.    Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the  25th  November shows atotal decrease of 4,155.  After a week of registration the Sheffield Corporation have onlyplaced between 150 to  200  men on various forms  of  outdoor labouring.  Distress is increasing especially amongst the engineering trades.  Nearly all  works at Sheffield are more  or less  engaged, but  the  number of  part  timers  on four days  a week or &quot; weeksabout &quot; exceeds 15,000, in addition to 9,000 on the books of the Employment exchanges and those who have exhausted all benefits.  The percentage of unemployed  members ofthe A.S.E. for the last week in November was 485 out of 4,075 members in the 17 Sheffieldbranches (10-5 per cent.) and  in Derby 158 out of 1,731 (or 9 per cent.).  The percentageswill-be slightly higher among the semi-skilled machinists.                           i    Employment of Ex-Service Men. Both Leeds and Sheffield Employment  Committees.support the resolution of  the Rotherham Committee for the limitation of  Corporationcontracts to supporters of the National Scheme.    (C 1942)                                                             3 Y  3
 Northern.     Unemployment. The live register for the week ending the 28th  November shows a decrease of 1,202.  In consequence of the fact that there are over 1,000 men and women unemployed at Darlington, the local Employment Committee are urging the Town Council to convene a meeting for the discussion of the provision of emergency work, and pressing for the replacement  of women on the corporation cars by men.     Provision of Lodging Accommodation. The Newcastle Committee  are making arrange- ments for the keeping of a register of lodgings, the members themselves being responsible for the bona fides of all offers of accommodation. North-western.     Unemployment. No unemployment figures are to hand.     Training. Complaints  of training delays are made at Preston and Rochdale.     Employment of Ex-Service Men. At Denton four deputations  of employers  repre- sentative of the felt hatting industry, the engineering trade,  the textile industry and general trade respectively, have been formed to interview other employers with a view to the absorption on the 5  per cent,  basis of local disabled men. Wales.     Unemployment. The live register for the  week ending the 28th  November shows a-decrease of 677.     Ironfounders&apos;&apos; Strike. The  ironfounders&apos; strike is now interfering more seriously with production.  This interference  is, however, not so  great in this area  as might have been expected, owing to  the  fact that in the  staple industries  the wages of the workmen in question are regulated in accordance with a practice which places them outside of National agreements.  There is an indication  that the men may be withdrawn by order of  the National Executives  of the societies  concerned.  The actual workers sent a deputation to Manchester to interview the  executive and inform the latter of local feeling, and there is at least a probability that the local  desire to remain ab work will be recognised.     Provision of Lodging Accommodation. Two Employment Committees have invited the public to furnish the Exchange  with  particulars of  accommodation likely to suit workpeople coming from a distance.     Swansea Harbour  Trust. Owing to the unsatisfactory  financial  position  of  the Swansea Harbour Trust, the bond holders and mortgage holders are to be asked to agree to payment  of the interest  due being deferred until the finances of the  Trust improve. All the Bristol  Channel docks suffered serious diminution of trade between 1914 and 1918.  At  Swansea the constant demands of labour  for wage extras before ships were unloaded is stated  to have resulted in the diverting of many ships to other ports.  The appointment of a receiver would, probably result in a state of chaos for some time, with serious consequences to the tinplate, steel, zinc and copper trades of the area.     Training. An unpleasant impression has been  caused by the publication  in  thePress of a  letter from the Superintendent of a Training Centre for ex-Service men nearCardiff.  The letter cites instances of alleged  ill-feeding, ill-clothing  and  general neglectat the Training Centre.   The Labour Party in Cardiff and district  have taken up thematter  vigorously.   It  is reported that the allegations by the  Superintendent  of theCentre are serious enough to justify a thorough inquiry by the appropriate department.Scotland.     Unemployment. There  are no figures  to  hand relating  to  the  unemployment situation.   It is  reported that the  Royal Naval Ammunition Factory at Alexandria maybe taken over by Messrs. Wm. Beardmore &amp; Co., Ltd.     The Inverness Women&apos;s Sub-Committee are showing great activity in their endeavours to introduce a new  industry in toy making.  Over 400 workmen are employed in a largeextension of the  dockyard of Messrs. A. McMillan &amp; Sons, Dumbarton.  The DunfermlineEmployment Committee are discussing the  acquisition of  800 acres of arable land  forconversion into small holdings for  the resettlement of ex-Service men.  Active measures are being taken at Port Glasgow to meet the shortage of shipwrights,  which is preventing the employment  of a considerable number of other trades.
                                   PART VI.--DISPUTES.                             (a) Involving a Stoppage of WorkBuilding and Allied  Trades.            Painters:  Derbyshire. The lock-out of painters at Chesterfield in connection  with  the        dispute between one non-federated firm  and the Master Painters&apos;Association over the payment        by this firm of rates higher than  the  district minimum rates (see Report for week  ending        the 10th December,  p. 482), has now been settled.  The question has been referred to  the        Joint Council of the  Master Painters&apos; Association and the Operatives&apos; Union, the clause pro-        prohibiting the payment of higher rates being waived for the moment.            Masons :  Edinburgh. A strike of operative masons employed by Messrs. J. Turner &amp; Co.        took place last week in connection with a proposed reduction in hours involving also reductions        in pay.  The matter  was settled by the intervention of the Master Builders&apos; Association, who        decided that the working week  should remain a 44-hour one all the year round.Mining and Quarrying.            Coal Miners: South Wales. About  2,000  miners employed at the Penallta Colliery of        the Powell Duffryn Company  came out on strike  on the 11th inst. in sympathy  with  the        surfacemen who have a grievance  over wages paid for working overtime.   The men agreed        on the 15th inst. to resume work pending negotiations.   ,                                ,            Acorn  Colliery Strike:  Swansea. A strike at this colliery, which has been  in progress        for 24 weeks, has now been settled in favour of the men.            Coal Miners: Scotland. About 1,000 men have been rendered idle by a dispute at the        Loanhead Colliery, Midlothian, between the management and four of the miners, who state        that they have been receiving  less  than the minimum rate of pay  during the last few weeks.        It is understood that the on cost workers also intend to come out in sympathy with the others.        The dispute will be reported to the Mid and  East Lothian Miners&apos; Board.            Coal Miners: Neath. The  strike  of 300  men at the Maesmarchog  Colliery over &quot; dead        work &quot; prices has been settled after three weeks.  The men returned to work on the old terms.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.            Ironfounders&apos;  Strike. The prospects  of a settlement of the strike have improved  con-        siderably during the week.  On the 10th inst.  the four members of the Engineering and Ship-        building  Trades Federation who were  appointed to attempt mediation in the dispute, met        -representatives of the ironfounders at the House of Commons.  A letter was read  from the        Engineering Employers&apos; Federation to  the  effect that the employers were prepared to meet        representatives of the three unions concerned and  to waive  the terms previously laid down        as conditions of such a meeting.  This communication was sent to the Joint Strike Committee        in Manchester, and the first business of a meeting, representative of every foundry union in        the kingdom, ostensibly called  to debate on  an extension of the strike and held in Manchester        on the 12th inst., was the consideration of this  fresh offer from the employers.  Mr. Thomas        Chadwick presided at the Conference, and after considerable discussion it was agreed, on the        recommendation  of the representatives who  had met the mediating committee  in London,        to enter into negotiations with  the Employers&apos;  Federation on the terms laid down in the letter.        If the negotiations prove fruitless  the Unions, whose members are not at present on strike,        will take a ballot on  the question of an extension in the nature of a sympathetic strike.  The        joint meeting with the employers was arranged to be held at Montagu House on the 17th inst.,        and branch meetings of the Unions will be held  throughout the country on the 19th to deliberate        on the report of the London Conference.  It is generally felt that a settlement is in sight, and        that if this is  effected it will be largely due to the personal efforts of Mr. Arthur Henderson,        who has been opposed to the strike from the outset and has worked very hard since the break-        up of the first  joint conference on the 11th October to bring the two parties together again.            Lanslon Monotype  Corporation, Ltd.:  Redhitt. The strike at this Company&apos;s works,        which took place on the 6th inst., in connection with the alleged victimisation of two employees        (see Report for week ending the 10th December, p. 482), is still in progress, but the Managing        Director has now consented to meet a deputation of the Strike Committee and to discuss the        situation.  The strikers,  Avho  number about  800, now demand not only the re-instatement        of the two men,  but full recognition of the  Trade Union and the Shop Committee  by the        management.Clothing Trades.             Tailors:  London. The consent of the London Master Tailors&apos;  Federation to grant a        48-hour week  to their operatives, provided an additional cost of 25 per cent, was charged on
        the clothing supplied them by the Merchant  Tailors&apos; Federation,  has caused a stoppage  of  t        the whole trade, as the Merchants refused to accept the latter condition.  The lock-out  of        master tailors involving the enforced idleness  of about 12,000 operatives,  began on the 15th;        inst.  A joint  conference held in the evening resulted in a settlement, conditional on the&apos;        acceptance of the terms by the members of the organisations concerned, and work was to have        been resumed on the 16th inst., but the Garment Workers&apos; Union found that it could not accept        the proposed terms.  They contend that the tailors are well able to concede a 48-hour week        without making any reduction in wages or increase in price.  In the event of a further deadlock        the parties have agreed to refer the whole matter to the Trade Board.Transport.            Motor Drivers: Dublin. It is reported that a serious development of the strike of Dublin        motor drivers, which began on the 29th ult. in protest against the motor permit order, occurred        on the 15th  inst., when two  mechanics were discharged for refusing to repair a licensed car.        Members of the A.S.E.  and other unions struck in sympathy, with these men, and the matter-        will probably be dealt with at the special  meeting of the Irish Trades Union Congress to  be        held on the 16th inst.            Taxicab Engineers: London. A strike of about 400 London taxicab engineers employed        by the British Motor Cab Company, took place on the 16th inst. over the dismissal of two men        for what is alleged to be a trivial cause.Food, Drink and Tobacco.            Bakers: Northumberland and Durham. The strike of operative  bakers which began  on        the 6th inst. was settled on the 9th, when the men agreed to accept advances of 5s. per week        to skilled and 2s. 6d. a week to unskilled workers, i.e. approximately half the amounts originally        demanded.Fishing.             Trawlermen:  Granton. The Granton trawlermen&apos;s strike has been referred to the Food        Controller and to the Ministry of Labour.   It  was arranged that a representative of the latter        should meet the parties concerned on the 7th inst. and endeavour to arrange a settlement.Miscellaneous.             Co-operative Employees: North-Western Area. A strike of the employees of nine Cumber-        land Co-operative  Societies, which began  on the 4th inst. over a question  of wages, is still in        progress.  The dispute  also concerns the full recognition of the Amalgamated Union of Co-        operative Employees by the Societies,  a joint conference held on the 11th inst. between the        Central Wages Board,  the Cumberland Wages Board, and the Western District Council of the      ,  A.U.C.E., failed to negotiate a settlement.             Organ-Builders: London.-London organ-builders  came out on  strike on the 12th inst..        to enforce demands for increases of pay from Is. 7\d. to Is. lid. per hour.                           (6) Not Involving a Stoppage of Work.Building and  Allied Trades.            Building Employees:  London. Building workers  employed  by the  Port  of London        Authority are agitating for the  recent wages increase agreed to between the  Federation of        Building Trade Operatives and the Federation of Master Builders.Mining and Quarrying.             Coal  Miners:   Scotland. A strike is  threatened in the Glengowan district, where coal        owners have refused to pay the percentage increase in connection with the 7-hour day.Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.            Engineers and the Court of Arbitration Award. The general dissatisfaction over the recent        award of 5s. per week to employees in the  engineering and shipbuilding  trades has found        expression in a protest made on behalf of the boilermakers and forwarded to the Ministry of        Labour.   It is  stated that following this,  joint action will be taken by the Engineering and        Shipbuilding Trades Federation  to  obtain some amendment to the existing agreement with        regard to the periodic consideration of wages claims, or  alternatively to bring the agreement        to an end.
            Electricians: London. The dispute in the London electrical trade has not yet been settled        (see Report for week ending the 10th December, p. 483).  Officials  of the E.T.U. repudiate        suggestions appearing in the Press  that a lightning strike is contemplated by the Union.  A        mass meeting of London members to be held on the 17th inst. will consider the situation.  A        statement of the general position from the point of view of the E.T.U.  was issued during the        week by the London District Committee and published in the &quot; Daily  Herald.&quot;Textile Trades.            Cotton Operatives. In spite of the existence of a wages agreement which  should remain        in operation until the end of April  next, it is understood that Lancashire cotton  workers will        probably put forward demands for  considerable increases in consequence of the extraordinary /      utate of the trade at present.Transport.            Dock  and Riverside Workers. Representatives of the National  Federation of Transport        Workers and the newly-formed National Council of Dock and Waterside Employers will meet on        the 18th inst., to consider the workers&apos; application for a National standard minimum wage of        16s. a day, and a&apos;general revision of working conditions.

Seamen and Overtime Rates. A dispute has been in progress concerning the payment  of        overtime  when  firemen are  required  to do extra work  at shifting ashes  after finishing        their ordinary work at the fires.

Firemen: &apos; London. The Fire  Brigade  Committee of the L.C.C.,  having  considered the        demands put forward by the firemen, is recommending the Council to revise as from the 1st April        last, the scales of pay of the staff on the basis of the pay of the Metropolitan Police Force, and        to establish a two-shift system by the 28th June, 1920, on the understanding that no application        for the establishment of a 48-hour week is made until the 28th June, 1922.

The management agreed        to extend the terms of  any award made in the Army and Navy Stores dispute to their own        employees, and undertook to abide by the  result of, a ballot of the  staff with respect to the        recognition of the Union.  The ballot showed an overwh elming maj ority in favour of recognition,        this was accordingly granted with a 35 per cent, advance  on wages up to  3 10s. a week, so that        all possibility of a strike was removed.  The dispute in the Army and  Navy Stores came before        the Court of Arbitration on the 12th inst. [see Part V (1)].  The Junior Army  and Navy and        the Haymarket Stores have also agreed to apply to the award to their employees  when it is        issued.            Drapers&apos; Shop Assistants : Glasgow. A dispute has arisen in Glasgow, in connection with        various demands put forward by the shop assistants,  and involving about 3,800 employees in        the wholesale section.
