Owing to the extravagant price now bding paid for promptsugar in America, the Commission are convinced that unless the                                              /total consumption of sugar In this country Is reduced by one-third in the first three months of next year, the price of rawsugar will be forced up to a point which will cause the retail price of sugar in this country to&quot;be raised to over lOd, a lb.They are conscious that a further reduction of the domesticration will cause considerable discontent and, moreover, thatthere are objections to such a reduction from the point ofview of national health. They suggest, however, that the public might acquiesce in a reduced domestic ration if it were made clear to them that the existing ration could only be maintained by  a considerable rise in the retail price. I, myself, should prefer a temporary reduction in the ration to a permanentincrease In the price,  and, after consultation with the sugar commission, I undu stand that it might be possible to allow the 8 oz* ration to continue during January, (for which month the issues to dealers have already been made) without seriouslyimpairing the effect of their proposal. It is really a conflicbetween the Commission and the Cuban planters, and holding offthe market appears to be the only effective weapon.                                   GEO. H.

ROYAL COMMISSION ON THE SUGAR SUPPLY.NOTE PROM THE SUGAR COMMISSION ON THE POSITION            OP THE SUGAR SUPPLY*The Pood Controller,,         Owing to the  great demand for sugar in the States,  a positive scarcity has  been created in the interval betweenthe exhaustion of the  1918/1919 Crop of Cubans, and theoncoming 1919/1920 crop.  The result has been that prices forprompt sugar i,e0 for  shipment in December,  have risen to afantastic height, as much as 15 cents, por lb. f0o.b. Cuba havingbeen paid, or nearly treble the price which the Commission paid for Its one-third of the 1918/19 crop0         m consequence the Commission has not felt itself ableto make the purchases  it should have made to keep up a regularsupplyi and further, by a bit of rather sharp practice on thepart, of the American Equalisation Board, the Commission hasreceived some 17,000 tons less than it should have done out  ofthe old crops         The resulting position of our supply, in respect of theperiod up to 31st March is as follows.  The Commission&apos;s stocks in this country were,  on 13th December                 Raw Sugar      66,000 tons                 Refined&quot;       76,000  &quot;and it has bought to arrive between now and 31st March                 Raw Sugar     135,000 tons                 Refined&quot;      153,000   11These combined quantities would maintain issues at the presentdomestic ration  (8 oz. per head per week) and  the prescribedmanufacturing rates for 16^ weeks.  But In any case  contracts for future supplies rsmst be made at least 10 weeks before thedate of exhaustion  of the supplies in  sight, or  (say) in thesecond week of January,  It  so happens however that the dates of arrival of on-coming supplies are  such that between now andthen there would be gaps in the continuity of  the  supply, sothat some sugar must in any case be bought to.arrive beforethe third week of February, in order  to prevent a  stoppage inour Refineries &amp;         Now if  the Commission should be compelled to buy morethan just enough to prevent such stoppage, any  earlier,  thanFebruary  (by which  time the quantity  of  sugar  coming down to  the cuban Ports will be so  large that it  must be  cleared away by  the holders), the financial effect will be very serious, becausesuch purchasing would contribute towards establishing  a high standard  of price which will influence prices  all  through theyear.                          (
          Prom a purely business point of view, there is nodoubt that the proper course for this Country would be to ke-epout of the Cuban market for as long as possible, and to wait until the pressure in their warehouses compels the Plantersto find an outlet for their sugar.   This would defeat thepresent conspiracy to force our hands, and would mean a saving of many millions in the purchases of the year.          But this cannot be done unless our more immediate requirements are reduced, and the question for decision bythe Cabinet is whether it would be willing to authorise areduction of the domestic ration from 8 oz. to 6 oz. per headper week, and other Issues in proportion, for (say) the months of January, February and March,  Merely to reducethe Issues to Manufacturers would not bo sufficient for thepurpose&quot;, seeing that the domestic ration accounts forpractically one-half of the total consumption *  Thus if the issues to Jam and other manufacturers were reduced to one half of the 1919 usage during the first three months of 1920the economy effected would do no more than postpone for 1^weeks the date at which purchases would have to be made;whereas if the domestic ration were also reduced for the sameperiod to 6 oz., the date could be postponed for 4 weeks,  a delay of no more than l-jj weeks would be of little or no use;but with one of 4 weeks, the.. Commission feels  fairly confident that the desired effect would be produced on the Cuban market.          The alternative is that later in the year the retail price of sugar In the shops will have to go up to not lessthan lOd per lb8, and very possibly even to 1/- per Ibv,unless a subsidy were to be given to sugar from theExchequer,(Sighed) H.a W.
