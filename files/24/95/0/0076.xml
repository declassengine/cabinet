DEPARTMENTAL.The Training of Disabled Men.                                                  i    The most important recent development in connection with the industrial trainingof disabled men has been the rapid increase in the number of Government InstructionalFactories.  This increase has occurred mainly during the last two months, and has been on a scale which should enable the Department to make great advances in its work in   (C 1946)  255  1/20 H k S                                              .     3 Z
 the near future.  The number of these factories now under the control of the Ministry is 31.  Of these, 18 have been acquired since the beginning of November, while six others acquired before that date are now only just coming into operation.  The factories acquired since the 1st November provide accommodation for a  little less than  9,000  men, and those for which Treasury sanction was obtained between the 1st May and the 1st November for about 3,400.  The factories taken over by the  Department on the 1st May provided accommodation for a little less than 2,400 men.  The Department have now, therefore, at their  disposal over five times the accommodation available in May,  and the bulk of this accommodation is still unoccupied.   The number of men to be provided for in these factories is in round numbers 15,000, and early in December only 1,769 men were actually in training.     Recent acquisitions include  the Ailsa Craig Factory at Chiswick, with a capacity of 400;. a portion of  the Ponder&apos;s End National Projectile Factory, where women as well as men will be placed in training ;  instructional workshops at Monkbridge Mills, Leeds, where over 450  men are to be trained in the building, decorating and furniture trades ; a factory in Ayres Road, Old Trafford ;  a factory at Newtown, Montgomery, where some 170 men should start training during January ; and the National Shell  Factory, Derby, where 250  men are  to be trained in engineering, and 350 in furniture making, woodwork, building and acetylene welding.  Factories previously acquired which are  now coming into operation include the Albert Factory, Cathcart, which will accommodate 1,750 trainees, where training should commence in the middle of January;  Salisbury Court, near South- ampton,  where, in addition to the main handicraft schemes, a certain  amount of agri- cultural training will be provided;  and the New  Basford Factory, near  Nottingham, where provision is being made for over 440 men.     The total number of men in training in the United Kingdom is now approximately 15,000.  But this increased acommodation should assist materially in  overcoming the difficulties  which, despite  the  greatly increased training facilities already  provided by the Department, have resulted in waiting lists of very considerable  size in all parts  of the country.  The provision of equipment has proved a matter of considerable difficulty, but the recent adoption of new organisation for this purpose should result in  a  marked improvement.  A few facts will serve to illustrate the work  already accomplished  and the need for the development recorded.   The situation varies in the different divisions. In the Northern Division, for example,  the number of men placed in. training since the beginning of May is 182, and  at the end of November 322 men were under instruction. Treasury sanction for the acquisition of the two Instructional Factories necessary to carry out the policy of the Department could not be obtained until September.  Operations at the Birfcley Factory, which should commence early in 1920, will ultimately provide accom- modation for 1,000 more  men.  In the North-Western Division the number of men  in training had been increased by the end of November to 1,306,  but there still remain 2,000 cases on  the waiting list.   Inspection by the Local Training Committees set up in this division is expected  to reduce this total very considerably.   The remainder must, however, be large, and training facilities for  the division can hardly be described as adequate.  Inthe South-Western Division, the number of men in  training is 456, a total representing a considerable rise during the last two months, and the outlook  for the future is promising. The waiting list, however, which, when the Ministry took over control from the Ministry of Pensions, stood only at 190, was well  over 1,000  at the end of November, and is likely to increase still further.  Considerable  use is being  made in this  division of training facilities  in private workshops.  An extension of accommodation at the  Radnor Road Instructional Factory, Bristol, has long been a matter of urgent necessity.  After  pro-tracted negotiations arrangements have been authorised which will increase the capacity of this factory from 250 to 350.  In the Bast Midlands  Division, where a Government Instructional Factory was from the first available at Loughborough, and technical schoolsat Lsicester, Derby, Lincoln and Northampton could also provide training facilities on a smaller scale, the number of men placed in training rose by 75 per cent, during November.With the acquisition of new Instructional Factories at New Basf ord and Derby, work  inthe  division should be well advanced.   In the South Central Division  the 500 men  intraining on the 1st August had increased to 780 by the end of  November, but the waitinglist  still stands at a total of over 1,000.  The acquisition of Sarisbury Court, with an accommodation calculated at 550, should go far to meet the needs of this division.  In Wales, where the waiting list had attained such  size that it was necessary  to  providepreparatory classes  for those men who had been longest on the list, the total number of men under instruction has been increased since July by 429, and stood at the end  of November  at 939.  The East Moors Factory, Cardiff, where provision is being made for 650 men and training is to begin  on the 1st January, together with a factory at Wrexham,
                  PART III.-THE  LABOUR AND  SOCIALIST PRESS.Trades Union Congress.    The  special Trades Union Congress,  which met  on Tuesday  and Wednesday, the9th and. 10th of December, is  reviewed in &quot; The Call &quot; (18th inst.) and the &quot; Workers&apos;-Dreadnought&quot; (20th inst).  Mr. Robert Williams  does not view the Congress with anyfavour and expresses the opinion that it has done nothing to carry the Trade Union move-ment forward from the Glasgow position.   He thinks, however, that there is an. indication that the  leaders are  feeling the pressure of an increasingly revolutionary rank and file.The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; discusses the Congress chiefly from the point of view ofthe &quot; Hands-ofl-Russia &quot; movement.   This paper complains that the  question of &quot; direct action, &quot;on this and the other questions has been postponed until February.   The &quot; daily herald &quot;  is criticised  for its inclination to support the official Labour Party and the opinion.is advanced that it would be better to have a smaller but  more purely Socialist  and pro-pagandist organ.than &quot; a costly reformist venture like the &apos; Daily Herald.&apos; &quot;  ContinentalSocialists, it is averred, will criticise  the scheme of the development  of this paper whichhas been so favourably received by  the Trades Union Congress.  The  conclusion of the&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; is   that the Congress is still controlled by &quot; opportunists.&quot;These criticisms, taken with those which were dealt with in the last issue of this report,*show how far-the Trades Union Congress has fallen from the favour it enjoyed last Septem-ber.f  It will be recalled that the Glasgowr Congress was hailed in the more extreme papersas the &quot; Great Congress &quot; and  the more moderate papers showed some uneasiness at such things as the vote disapproving the Parliamentary Committee&apos;s action in declining to call.a special Congress on  &quot; direct action.&quot;The Labour Movement.     Ih this connection a manifesto  signed by Mr. J. T. Murphy, which appears in theMerthyr  &quot;Pioneer,&quot; the Huddersfield &quot;Worker&quot; and the Glasgow &quot;Socialist,&quot; is  ofinterest.   Mr. Murphy writes in connection with the National Conference to be held on the10th and 11th January under  the auspices of the National Administrative Committee ofShop Stewards and Workers Committees.   He maintains that one of the most dangerousdevelopments in the industrial organisations of  the working classes is  the  growth of  ahofficial class with its own vested interests, and an excessive control over all the movements of the workers.  These official leaders, he suggests, must always be conservative in out lookand action, as a result of the fact that trade unions are limited constitutionally to very narrowchannels of activity.  The only way  in which this  state of affairs can be remedied in hisopinion is by a drastic reformation of trade union constitutions.   But he recognises thatsuch a reformation must necessarily be a long process, and to meet the immediate situation,he  argues that the rank and  file must build up an alternative organisation which mayexercise its power to urge trade union  leaders forward, or may, when circumstances demand,apt independently of the official organisations.   A similar attitude is taken up  by &quot; the call &quot;in a somewhat hasty consideration of the &quot; General Staff &quot; proposals.   As a contrast to  Mr. Murphy&apos;s  manifesto may be noted the  opinion of Mr.  A. M.  Thompson  inthe &quot; Clarion &quot; (19th inst.).  Mr. Thompson concludes that the safest way to overcome the troubles and dimculties besetting the country would be the &quot; election &quot; of a Labour Govern-meht.  He thinks that it would be well that a Labour Government should have to dealwith the  &quot; endlessly  rising claims of trade unions and the hindrance to  trade revival pre-sented by constantly recurring and  threatened  strikes.&quot;  Mr. Thompson professes thatthe only  thing which causes him uneasiness in the matter is the attitude of the LabourParty towards international questions.  He devotes the main part  of his article  to  re-commending  the Labour Party to adopt  a more  truly imperial policy.   This  article is  *endorsed in the &quot; Clarion &quot; (26th inst.) by Mr. Blatchford.                          * Cf Report, 17th December, p. 487.                          t Cf. Eeport, 24th September, pp. 2(34-5.will provide accommodation urgently needed in this division.  The factory at Newtown,Montgomery, will  provide  for  300 men.  The position in London and the surroundingdistricts, where the lack of training accommodation has given rise to serious complaint,should  be  materially relieved, by  the development of instructional factory accom-modation now in progress at Hackney Marshes, Cricklewood and Ponders End.
 The Second (Berne) Socialist International.     The question whether or not to hold the February meeting of this body at Geneva, as determined upon by the Lucerne meeting last August, together with the decision of the German Independent Socialists to join the  Third (Moscow) International, arouses  some discussion.  Mr.  Ramsay Macdonald deals with the matter in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; of the 18th inst. and &quot; Forward &quot; of the 20th inst.  In. the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; he expresses the hope that the February Conference will be held and the opinion, that if it should be postponed,  the Second International will find itself in a  grave position.  He does not think  that  the Second International should remain inactive, and suggests that active steps  should be  taken to create a  new  international which  should comprehend every manifestation of  the working  class  spirit &quot; even  the  most extreme  form born of the war and  its  mischiefs.&quot;  In  &quot;Forward,&quot;  writing after  the decision to postpone the Geneva Conference, he expresses disagreement with the reasons advanced for this action. &quot; Justice &quot;  (25th  inst.), however, expresses full agreement Avith the postponement.   &quot; A little more time,&quot; thinks this journal, &quot; will afford the Socialist atmosphere time for clear- ing itself.&quot;   The  &quot; Socialist,&quot;  18th  inst., discusses the  memorandum prepared by the I.L.P.  on &quot; Socialism and Government &quot;* for submission to the Geneva Conference.  It regards the manifesto as the culmination of a campaign which it says has been proceeding for many months to keep the I.L.P. branches from going &quot;left,&quot; and concludes that it will have a beneficial influence in the  direction  of a  united Communist Party, leaving  as it does those members of the I.L.P. &quot; who  no longer reverence  capitalist democracy &quot; no other alternative  than to throw in their lot with those who adhere  to the Third Inter- national.   This paper  (24th inst.) takes full advantages  of the decision to postpone the Geneva Conference and insists  that it is a typical example of the  inertia  of the Second, as contrasted with the virility of the  Third, International. Prices  and Profiteering.     The food situation is discussed  at considerable length in the  &quot; Clarion,&quot; 19th inst., by Mr. R.  B. Suthers.  Mr. Suthers  maintains that this is no time to pursue a policy of de-control and calls for the strengthening of the Ministry of Food.  The &quot; British Citizen &quot; continues to devote much space to the details of the administration of the Profiteering Act, and the activities in this connection  of Mr. Terrett.  Mr. Terretfs position is given full support, and  close co-operation between  the Ministers responsible for the Act and the Central Profiteering Committee is recommended.   The memorandum  submitted to the Special Trades Union Congress  on high prices by the M.F.G.B. has not had a very favour- able reception in  the Labour and Socialist Press.   Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; 18th inst., criticised it for not giving sufficient attention to the vital problem of money and credit, and the &quot; New Age,&quot; 18th inst., criticises it also on the ground  that the measures recommended in the memorandum involve in  every case  the use  of  State machinery.  It is urged that before the Labour Movement can be entitled to the respect due to &quot; constructive thinking,&quot; it must put forward a programme susceptible of being carried out by Labour itself.  The &quot; Democrat,&quot; 19th inst., devotes an article to a  detailed condemnation of the proposals contained in the memorandum and maintains that they are utterly impracticable.  In &quot; The Call &quot; Mr. A. A. Watts Avelcomes the memorandum andconfesses that he has been much encouraged by it.   His article is, however, the only one that has appeared in which the M.F.G.B. proposals have been unreservedly commended.Housing.    The interest of the Socialist and Labour Press in the housing  problem is increasing.The Merthyr &quot; Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Democrat &quot; have instituted weekly columns in whichthey record small events in the progress of housing  schemes.  In the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; 18th inst.,  Mr. William Graham argues that a great obstacle to the successful progress of housing schemes is the high cost of materials and that the cost of building new housescould be reduced to a reasonable figure by anti-trust legislation on the part of the Govern-ment.   Mr.  W. A. Appleton, in the &quot; Democrat,&quot; 19th inst., attributes the housing diffi- culty entirely to the results of the land tax proposals of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910,and calls for an admission from the  Government  to this effect.   The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; 24th inst., and &quot; The Call,&quot; 26th inst., insist that no proposals for increasing the  amount of labour in the building trades should be entertained until proper measures have beentaken to secure the  building trades  operatives  from the time of depression which  it is                            * Cf. Eeport, 17th December, p. 492.
feared will follow the present boom.  The  &quot; New Age &quot; criticises the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech to the Building Trades National Joint Industrial Council^ and takes this oppor-tunity to reiterate its arguments that the  key to the whole economic, industrial andpolitical situation is the distribution of &quot; purchasing power &quot; in the population .fThe International Situation.     The interest of the Socialist Press in Foreign Affairs has revived in recent weeks, butcomment this week on the international situation has been overshadowed by other items of interest.   The Christmas message of the &quot; Socialist&quot; is a call for peace a peace whichcan only be achieved by the movement of a united working-class under Russian inspirationtowards the  conquest  of  world-power.   The &quot; Labour  Leader &quot; and the &quot; BradfordPioneer&quot;  concentrate on  the suggestions for financial and military co-operation between england and France.  The former derives some satisfaction  from, the view that the ap-proach of bankruptcy will bring our foreign policy of profligacy and crime to a rapid end ;the latter wishes to make it clear that any  agreement  which may now be concluded willbe repudiated at the earliest possible moment.Ireland, Egypt and India.     Recent events in Ireland and Egypt,  together with the reports of the evidence heard by Lord Hunter&apos;s enquiry into the Punjab riots  arouse voluminous discussion. The general opinion is that these events have openly exposed the barbarity of imperialism.  The &quot; NewStatesman &quot; argues that the British public cannot escape its responsibility in the matterof  Amritsar  by denouncing General  Dyer as a criminal.  The essential  and governingfact is that the British administration in India is attempting to rule a number of nationsagainst their will.  Recourse to force is a necessary corollary of our failure to  introducedemocratic institutions concurrently with the spread of democratic ideas.   The &quot; labour leader&quot;  and the &quot; Bradford  Pioneer&quot; strongly emphasize the usual  I.L.P. moral thatthe British people are themselves responsible in so far as they permit the men who pursue. a criminal policy to remain in power ;  and Messrs. Ramsay Macdonald and William Stewartin &quot; Forward &quot; reason in the same strain, that the only solution is for the people  to change their government and to  change their own spirit  by voting I.L.P.   &quot; The Call,&quot; on theother hand, calls upon the workers to repudiate  all responsibility for imperial policy, whichrepresses their own  freedom as  much as  that of subject races and believes that  Britishcapitalism itself is in too precarious  a  condition to endure the &quot; White man&apos;s burden.&apos;/The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; Avelcomes the report that an Indian Bolshevik commission has reached  Samara to enter into relations with Soviet  Russia, and suggests that Westerncapitalist militarism is the one obstacle to the spread of Soviet government in tlie East.Russia.     Discussion, both of English  policy towards Russia, and of the internal situation there,is increasing in amount, though there is no approach, as regards the number of articles,to the standard attained in the  summer.  In the  &quot; Clarion,&quot; Mr. A. M. Thompson puts forward the theory that the famine prevailing in Russia is not due  to the  blockade butto the feud between the peasants and the Bolshevik Government.  Mr. Thompson developsthe argument that the Soviet  system is more suited to the present conditions  of  Russiathan a Constitutent Assembly, but that the Bolshevik dictatorship must be eliminated :the Zemstvo and the Co-operative Societies must be made  to furnish the nucleus of anational  policy  and  a central  government.   &quot; Rob Roy,&quot;  in &quot;Forward,&quot; sifts the evidence of atrocities  and misgovernment and adversely comments on  the Bolshevistregime.                            PART IV. GENERAL TOPICS.The General Situation.    The general situation in the past two weeks, as is usual at this time of the year, hasbeen on the whole uneventful.  Labour propaganda has been interrupted by the holidayseason, and though a few meetings have been held in connection with the campaign for the nationalisation of the mines, and with regard to the new scheme of railway control, nothing of note  has been either said or done.  A number of  disputes have occurred, but these                            *  Of, Report, 17th December, p. 491.                            f  Of- Report, 3rd December, pp. 451-2.
  have been sectional in extent and minor in importance.  As a result of the good offices of  the Ministry of Labour and the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress,  there is hope that the ironmoulders&apos; strike may be settled at an early date.  The growing  tendency, to which attention has previously been drawn in this Report, to negotiate rather  than strike on important national matters has received further confirmation in the decision  of both parties to refer the national demands of the Transport Workers Federation for a  16s. per day minimum wage for dockers and waterside workers to a Court of  Enquiry.  Several demonstrations of unemployed in various provincial towns have taken place, and  there is evidence  of increasing discontent among ex-Service men, chiefly on the ground  of unemployment and. the high cost of living.  Unemployment Insurance Bill.      This Bill was formally introduced by the Minister in the House of Commons on the  23rd inst.  The Bill  extends  the  contributory scheme of Unemployment  Insurance to  substantially all the persons falling within the Hearth Insurance Scheme, with the following  exceptions: (a)  Agriculture and domestic service are not included; (6) in Ireland, the  Bill applies only to workmen  in the trades now insured against unemployment under  the existing Acts.   The Bill further enables the Minister of Labour, with the approval  of  the Treasury, to make orders bringing within the scheme of unemployment insurance any  of the industries thus excepted.      The amount of unemployment benefit  proposed is 15s. per week in the case of men  and 12s. per week in the case of women, as compared with a benefit of 7s. (shortly to be  increased to 11s.) under the existing Acts.   The contributions of the insured persons will  be in the case of men 2d. per week from the employers and 2d. per week from the employed;  and in  the case of women, 1\d. per  week  from  employers and employed respectively..  Certain lower rates of contributions and benefit are proposed for boys and girls between  the ages of 16 and 18.   The State will contribute one-third of the combined, contributions  of employers and workpeople.      An opportunity will be afforded for industries to contract  out of the general scheme  by setting up special schemes of their own, giving equal, or superior, advantages, such as  may be approved  by the Minister of Labour under special order.   Power is also reserved  to the Minister, if he thinks fit, to set up a special scheme, on his own initiative, for any  particular industry.   In cases  where  special schemes are set up, a State grant will be  paid not exceeding one-tenth of the estimated amount of the contributions which would  have been payable by the employers and employed if they had remained under the general.  scheme.      It is estimated that about  11,750,000 persons will be covered by the Bill, and out of  this total there may be between one and a half and four millions under special schemes.  The annual cost to the Exchequer under the Bill will be from three to four millions.  The  annual cost of unemployment insurance to the State at present is approximately one and a  quarter millions.  Court of Enquiry.     A Court of Enquiry under the Industrial Courts Act is being held to consider the ques-  tion of  the, hours of coal shippers.  The members of the Court are Mr. Rigby Swift, K.C.  (Chairman), Sir Thomas Watson and Mr. T..H. Randell, nominated by the employers, Mr.  V. Hartshorn, M.P., and Mr. J. Wignall, M.P., nominated by the trade unions.  Coal Industry.     Meetings addressed by miners&apos; leaders  in mining areas continue to be reported, Mr..  Smillie&apos;s addresses at  Durham and Newcastle on the 20th and 21st inst. being the most  important.  In an article in the &quot; Western Mail &quot; 16th inst. Mr. Brace  subscribes to the  opinion that the British coal industry cannot be  carried on in the future  without some  arrangement whereby the less advantageously placed collieries may be assisted by the more  favoured collieries, and that some pooling arrangement is necessary for the maintenance  of national rates of wages for miners.  The Railways.     Discussions took place between representatives of the N.U.R. and the A.S.L.E. and F.  and the Minister of Transport on the 17th and 18th inst., and the Executive Committee of&quot;the N.U.R. met on the 19th to receive the report of their negotiating  committee.   Mr. Thomas has promised to explain the proposal with  regard to standardisation at a mass- meeting at Birmingham  on the 4th January, 1920, and a full delegate meeting .of the
 N.U.R. will be held on the following Wednesday to consider the executives report.  There are signs that there may be some opposition at this delegate meeting to the so-called joint control proposals.  The South Wales and Monmouthshire Branches of the N.U.R.  met at Cardiff on the 21st inst. and decided to instruct their delegates not to give  support to any scheme of control &quot;which does not definitely lay down the principle of nationalisation.&quot; Some restiveness is also reported from South Wales signalmen.  It may be noted that Mr. J. Bromley at Leeds on the 21st inst. delivered a somewhat militant speech, perhaps in sympathy with the more militant note which is reported to be prevalent in local  railway- men^ branches.  And it should be remembered that Mr. Bromley is usually more aggressive on the platform than in the conference-room.  The negotiations between the R.C.A.  and the  Ministry of Transport have also been proceeding. Hours of Employment (No. 2) Bill.     The Parliamentary Agricultural Committee received on Wednesday the 17th inst. a deputation representing the  Central and Associated Chambers of Agriculture, the N.F.U., the  Highland Agricultural Society, the Central Land Owners&apos; Association, the  National Farmers Union  of Scotland, the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union, the Welsh Agricultural Council and the Irish Farmers&apos; Union.  The deputation protested against the inclusion of agricul- ture in any way in this Bill.   It is reported, however, that it became clear in  the course; of the discussion that the farmers and landowners&apos; view on the matter has been somewhat modified and that a compromise might be acceptable to them which included agriculture in the general terms of the Bill but allowed employers and employed to contract out of the Bill by mutual agreement.     In connection with this Bill, it is interesting to note that the various Committees of the Birmingham Board of Guardians have reported upon the application of a 48-hour week to the institutions under their control.  With the exception of the Infirmaries Committee. the Committees in charge of institutions state that the difficulties in the way of a 48-hour week can be surmounted as soon  as  the necessary additional staff have  been engaged. The Infirmaries Committee recommend that the working hours per week of their staff be fixed at 54, their difficulty being to provide residential accommodation for the additional staff which the 48-hour week would necessitate. Labour and Municipal Politics.     The endeavour of municipalities which are now controlled by  labour majorities to enforce  unionism upon their employees is becoming more  widespread  (cf.  Report, 17th December, page 492).   The West Ham Town Council has decided to exhibit a printed notice in all its Departments  setting  forth its wish that all employees should join their respective trades unions.  From the employees side, a  meeting  is reported of  employees-of the Woolwich Borough Council which has passed a resolution declaring  that  after the 15th January next trade unionist employees would refuse to work with non-unionists. The preference of local labour parties for the use of &quot; direct labour &quot; in the prosecution of local development schemes  has already been noted in this Report in connection with Housing.   A further  development in this direction is  reported at  Southampton  where the local Board of Guardians have decided to employ &quot; direct labour &quot; in coffin maldng and funeral undertaking. The  Daily Herald.     It is announced that the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers&apos; Union have decided to invest  2,000 in the debenture stock to be issued by this paper ; the National Amalgamated Labourers&apos; Union,  500 ;  the National Amalgamated Furniture Trades Association,  2,000.  There would appear to be no increase in the number of Development Committees in existence in connection with the publicity  campaign being conducted in support of  this paper.   Many  resolutions are  reported from trade union branches calling upon their  executives either to invest money in the paper or else to raise  a levy on their memberships for the purpose of making a free gift.  - Employment of Women.     Three developments in connection with the employment of women in professions may be noted.  The Incorporated Society of Accountants and Auditors have decided to admit women to full membership.  The National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship haveissued a manifesto protesting against the dismissal of women generally in favour of men and  boys who have never seen war service, but recognising the claims of ex-Service men,as of greater comparative importance than those of women who have entered  commerce
\ and industry during the war.   Finally, it is reported that it has been decided to formV permanent organisation in the Bhondda area to  defend the  status of married  women teachers.   The passing  of the  Sex Disqualification  (Removal) Act has, of course, affected the position of women in those professions from which they were excluded by law. Second (Berne) Socialist International.     Meetings  of the Committee of Action of this body were held in London on the 20th and 21st insts.  Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., presided.  It wTas decided to adjourn the full  conference which was timed to  meet at Geneva  in February until the 31st July, 1920.  Committees were appointed  to report to the conference on the questions of  war responsibilities ;  socialisation  ; the political system of socialism ; and the development of the press.   Arrangements were made for sending out commissions, agreed upon at the Lucerne Conference last  August, to  enquire,  into  conditions  in Russia, Germany and Poland.  These commissions will report to the Committee of Action at a meeting arranged for the 28th February, 1920, in Rotterdam.  The Committe also passed resolutions putting forward six demands, including the following : Early ratification of the Peace Treaties and an early meeting of the League of Nations ;  peace with Russia, and the stopping of all measures  of blockade ;  the creation  of  an  International Economic Council with repre- sentation from Labour organisations; and the  raising of an international loan to provide for immediate necessities in food and raw materials. Cotton Spinners&apos; Bonus.     In order to meet the demands of Lancashire Cotton operatives for a share in the existing trade prosperity, and in view of the fact that an agreement to work at the present rates remains in force until the end  of March, the Committee of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos;  Associations  has offered all employees in the Federation Mills  bonuses varying from  3 to  9 between now and the 20th March.   The  attitude of the Unions was  at first hostile to the proposal, and the amount and method of payment of the bonus was  criticised as likely  to lead to confusion and unfairness.  The employers propose to pay  the bonus on three separate dates, the 10th January,  the 14th February and the 20th March, 1920, on the following scale :-to workpeople  under  16 (male and female)  1  on each of the dates  named, being a  total  bonus of  3 ; to workpeople over 16 and under 21,  1 10s. a total of  4 10s. ; to females over 21,  2 a total of  6 ; to males over 21,  3  a total of  9.   The Executives of the Operative Spinners&apos; Association&quot; and the Cardroom Amalgamation finally decided to recommend the acceptance of the terms by their members, subject to an alteration in the method of payment by which the  bonus shall be spread over the weekly earnings so as to form an addition to the wages.  The Weavers&apos; Amalgamation and the Textile Trades Federation are expected to demand, their  inclusion in this or in some similar scheme. Trade Union Topics.     National Builders&apos; Labourers&apos; and Constructional Workers&apos;  Society. This society has lately been constituted and is an amalgamation of members of the National Association of Building Labourers ; the Navvies&apos;, Builders&apos; Labourers&apos; and General Labourers&apos;  Union; the United Order of General  Labourers&apos; Union of Great Britain and  Ireland, and  the United Builders&apos; Labourers&apos; Union.   The officers and organisers of this amalgamation are about to open a campaign to induce all builders&apos; labourers and public works men to join the new Society.     Miners&apos; Federation. In the  South Wales district the Miners&apos;  Federation and the Monmouthshire and South Wales Enginemen, Stokers and Craftsmen&apos;s  Association have appointed a joint committee to draft  a scheme for co-ordination of effort and policy; itis hoped that the antagonism between  the two societies, which has been a continual source of trouble in the coalfield, will  now be  removed.     Amalgamated Engineering  Union. An effort is being made to secure that the threesocieties which, while recording a substantial  majority in favour of amalgamation,  didnot secure sufficient votes to legalise amalgamation, shall take a fresh ballot of their mem-bers.  The Toolmakers&apos;  Society has  already agreed to this course, and it is expected thatthe E.T.U. will take the same  step.   The case of the National Society of Brassworkers is more doubtful.  The eight societies which have accepted amalgamation have formed a Rules Committee which is to proceed at once to draft a  constitution for the new union. It is probable  that this  committee, at any rate so far as the industrial government of thesociety is concerned, will strike out on new lines and allow wider scope  for  workshop organisation and wider powers to shop stewards  and works committees.
      Printing and Kindred Trades Federation. A committee is being formed by members from various printers&apos; societies to draft a scheme for the amalgamation of all organisations catering for printers.  The Scottish  Typographical  Association has decided to send a representative, but the Executive of  the National Union  of Journalists has refused the invitation of the Printing Trades Federation to send a representative. Ex-Service Men.      National  Union of Ex-Service Men.--Th.e National Executive of the  Labour Party has  issued a circular to its local organisations recommending them to  co-operate in the fullest possible way with the National Union of ex-Service Men and to accept the affiliation of local branches of that Union.  It may be expected that, as a result of this, the Union will rapidly  develop.  The Union, whose extremist tendencies have  previously been referred to in this Report, is largely in  the hands&apos;of the I.L.P.   Members of that body took a prominent part in its foundation, and they  have been busy in its organisation  and de- velopment. The Union has been specially active in two directions.  It has been prominent in organising  demonstrations in connection with  unemployment, and in advocating the claim for &quot; back pay &quot; at Colonial rates for all ex-Service men which was originally made by Mr. R. L. Outhwaite.  The National Union consistently advises all its members to join Trade Unions, and aims at constituting itself the ex-Service Department of the Labour movement. The Union  has recently  made considerable progress in South Wales, where whole  branches of the Comrades of the Great  War and the N.F.D.D.S.S. have transferred to it.  This accession of  strength is largely due to the propaganda of the National Union at the time of the railway strike.  Whereas  the Comrades of the Great War assisted to maintain essential  services, and the  N.F.D.D.S.S. declared  its neutrality, the National Union ranged itself on the side  of the  railwaymen, and has since maintained that  it is the only organisation of ex-Service  men with a definitely Labour policy.   The Union has a good publicity service, and although it grossly exaggerates  its membership,  its influence is* undoubtedly growing.      Unrest among  Ex-Service Men.- Ex-Service  men are growing increasingly  restive,. owing in the main to unemployment  and the high cost of  living.  Several  meetings have recently been held protesting against&quot; the apathy of the Government,&quot; and many demands have been made that employers should be  compelled to accept  ex-Service  men, and that State  factories should be used  for the absorption of the unemployed. The discontent of ex-Service  men is  displaying itself also in dissension within their organisations, and many  secessions have recently taken place  from the Comrades of the Great War  and the N.F.D.D.S.S.                        &quot;       -.   &apos;                      PART V.

Of this number  357,661 had been heard by the Courts of Referees.  An analysis of  344,843 claims heard  shows that 89,911 were allowed, 254,401 disallowed, and in 531 a compromise was effected.&apos;  Th  proportion of disallowances to claims heard is therefore 73 &quot;8 per cent. Of the total  disallowances, 44 &quot;8 per cent, were disallowed owing to refusal to accept suitable  employ-  ment.                  ,                                               .

Vehicle  Building. As already reported, the comprehensive wages agreement reached between the Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation and the unions concernedhas  been ratified by the unions.   One effect of  this  agreement will  be to place wood-working engineers outside the scope of the Council as regards wages questions, and theCouncil will therefore deal  only with the non-engineering  section of the industry.

A large number of fitters and turners have been thrown out of work by the ironfounders&apos; strike.    The Ironfounders&apos; Strike. Special efforts are being made in the larger towns  of thearea to collect and distribute funds for necessitous  cases.  At meetings held in the Bir-mingham and West Bromwich  districts  on the 13th and 14th inst., Messrs. Davison andBailey (Vice-President, Ironfounders) both intimated that &quot;  if the men were driven backto work by starvation, the employers might find that although they had won the conflict,they would lose it because of the action of the men in the shops.&quot;   The controversy be-tween the Ironfounders and the General  Workers&apos; Union continues and Messrs. Bailey andHallas (General Workers) are challenging each other to debate publicly the questions a tissue.   At a  meeting of the National Federation of General Workers held in Birmingham (20th inst.) the following resolution was unanimously adopted.  &quot; That should the settle- ment in the  ironfounders&apos; dispute contain any clause detrimental to the interests of the members and organisations  of the General Workers&apos; Unions, an emergency meeting of this district committee be summoned immediately to decide on  a united course of action to combat any such policy.&quot; Yorkshire and East  Midlands.

Unemployment. -The Live Register for the week ending the 12th December reveals a decrease of 150.   There are a large number of cotton spinners unemployed.  The primary reason for this is the readjustment of operations and the changes in the distribution of duties as between male and female workers introduced during the war.   The matter is the subject of negotiations between the Operative Spinners&apos; Association and the employers.     General. At Altrincham  the Ruby Cycle Co. are building  new  works which are estimated to absorb 1,000 workpeople.   At Manchester, Messrs.

A strike of about 180 painters began on the 22nd inst.  owing to the        alleged failure of the employers to grant the award of the National Conciliation Board which        provides for an additional 2d. an hour to employees in the building trade.  The master painters        have apparently declined to be bound by the action of the York Master Builders&apos; Association        in accepting the award and have ceased to be affiliated to that body.Mining and Quarrying.            Coal Miners:  Canon Coal Company. A strike of  the men employed at this company&apos;s        Cadder Pits took place recently as a protest against the dismissal of two checkweighers who        sought to impede barge-loading on the Forth and Clyde  Canal during the railway strike.  The        company is anxious to have the matter dealt with in a Court of Justice, while the Miners&apos; Union        has asked for a joint conference under the auspices of the Coal Control Department and has        promised that the men shall resume work conditional upon the suspension of  legal  proceedings        until this joint meeting has taken place.  The company, however, has refused to agree to this.        About 600 men are effected.            Coal Miners: Midlothian. The strike at the Loanhead and  Burghlee Collieries which        began on the 8th inst. and involved about 1,000 men, has been provisionally settled, the matter        in dispute being referred to arbitration.  (See Report for week ending the 18th December, p. 499.)Metal Engineering and Shipbuilding.            Ironfounders&apos; Strike. In the period  between the issue of the Report for the week ending        the 17th December and the present Report a further deadlock has been created and removed.        The adjourned joint Conference which was held at the Ministry of Labour on the 23rd inst. broke        down in consequence of  the action of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation, who  insisted        on the settlement of a local dispute  of long standing before the terms of a national settlement        were put into force.  The dispute.in question is a conflict between the Friendly Society of        Ironfounders and the General Workers&apos; Unions at West Bromwich as to which is entitled to claim        the membership of certain workers employed in moulding.  The Unions refused to admit the        relevancy of the introduction  of this local matter which they considered a side issue. The        deadlock was apparently complete, but efforts to remove it  were continued by the  Ministry        of Labour during the Christmas period, while the intervention of the Parliamentary Committee        of the Trades Union Congress secured a meeting of the Unions concerned in the West Bromwich        dispute.  The latter unions have now agreed that the men on strike there shall return to work,        if  a national settlement is reached,  pending a thorough investigation into the whole question        by a special Committee, appointed at the above-mentioned meeting, and consisting of Messrs.        Harry Gosling, G. H. Stuart Bunning, Robert Williams, A. Purcell, E. L. Poulton and C. W.        Bowerman, M.P.  This offer of a compromise on the part of the men was conveyed to Sir Allan        Smith through  the medium of the Ministry of Labour, and a further joint conference was        suggested.  This meeting will  be held at the Ministry on the 2nd January, and1 should there        be  an agreement over the wages question, a settlement, subject to the approval of the men,        will be effected.            With regard to the wages question the position at  the former joint meeting was that the        Union Executives agreed to submit to their members the employers&apos; offer to pay the 5s. advance        granted under the  recent Court of Arbitration Award in the  engineering and shipbuilding        trades.
             Engineers: British Motor Gab Company.-The strike of taxi-cab engineers at the company&apos;s         Grosvenor Road Garage,&apos; which occurred on the 16th inst.  (See Report for the week ending         17th December, p. 50) was settled on the  20th inst.  The men obtained their demands with         regard to the re-instatement of the two men whose discharge caused the strike.  Certain pro-         posals for the introduction of a system of payment by results were withdrawn by the company         before the men resumed work.. Textile Trades.

In these cases the Merchant Tailors&apos; Federation  has granted         the master tailors enough to cover the extra cost involved by this concession. Transport.             Tugboatmen : Gravesend.-A strike of tug-hands took place on the 20th inst., over demands         for one day off in seven or extra payment for Sunday labour.   The employees of four firms were         affected, and the demands were granted after a two days &apos;strike, the firms agreeing  to a 24-hour         break every week or pay at the rate of one-sixth  of the weekly wage.             Drivers : Glasgow.-k strike of taxi-cab and other motor vehicle drivers who are members ,        of the Glasgow Branch of the United  Vehicle AVorkers Union took place on the 26th inst.. The         chief  point at issue is the demand of the men for a 50s. weekly minimum.   An extension of the  ,  .     strike is threatened as the two large  firms  concerned  are refusing to recognise the Union or to         submit the dispute to arbitration ; and other Unions have  already instructed their members         to abstain from doing any work for these firms.             Motor Drivers:  Dublin. The strike of drivers against the Motor Permits Order is still in         progress and motor traffic all over the country is seriously affected.

A  delegation of the Congress  Executive Com-         mittee, the transport workers,  dockers, railwaymen, engineers and motor drivers was appointed         to visit London and to consult the N.U.R., A.S.E. and the National Federation  of Transport         &quot;Workers.  The Congress also resolved that no trade unionist should handle or repair any motor         vehicle, and that a strike fund should be established  and administered by a special com.mittee         of representatives of all the trades concerned. &apos; Chemical Oil, etc., Trades.

Insurance Agents: Pearl Assurance Company, Ltd. The threatened strike of agents em- ployed by the Pearl Assurance Company took place on the 26th inst. when about 3,000 men ceased work in different parts of the country.

The Conciliation Board rate for the district is Is. 5d. per hour, but the         employers are not represented on the Conciliation Board, and, as a consequence, the rate is not         paid.   The workers now receive Is. id. per hour, and are asking for  Is. Qd. immediately and    I  V.  Is. 8d. after the 1st March.
Mining and Quarrying.            Colliery Enginemen  and Firemen: Staffordshire. In connection with the  agitation over-        points arising out of payment under the Sankey Award to these workers the Union of Colliery        Enginemen and Firemen has decided to take a strike ballot unless the Coal Owners&apos; Association.        immediately consents to meet representatives of the  Union to discuss the matter.  A strike of        these men would affect about 20,000 miners in the district.            Fire Clay Workers: Scotland. Managers of the Scottish Fire Clay Mines are protesting-        that an increase of  50 per annum has been granted to managers engaged in coal mines, but        has not been extended to managers of fire clay mines, and demanding that this  should be paid        to them.Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.            Electricians : London. There has been no important development in the London electrical        trade dispute.  The London District Committee of the Electrical Trades Union has recommended        the men to &quot; go slow &quot; until the sanction of the National Executive to proceed with the dispute-        has been obtained.   The Union is demanding 12J per cent, above the 2s. flat rate which has        been granted by the employers.Transport.            Dock and Riverside Workers. Negotiations in connection with the demands of dock and        waterside workers have been proceeding since the 18th inst. when the National Council of Dock        and Waterside Employers  refused to  grant the 16s. a day minimum but suggested  that the        whole matter in  dispute be submitted to an inquiry under the Industrial Courts Act.  The        National Federation has agreed to adopt the principle of an impartial inquiry but they propose        a Court consisting  cf seven members, three to be nominated by each side with a chairman        appointed by the Ministry of Labour.            Shipping Staffs : Port of London Authority. It is reported that considerable unrest prevails        among members of the National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs employed by        the Port of London Authority as the recent award is  considered  totally inadequate.            Railwaymen : Northampton. The trouble at Northampton over the alleged unfair promoting-        tion by the L. and N.W.R. Company to an inspectorship of a man who worked during the strike        still continues and negotiations between the railwaymen and  the officials which were held        on the 17th inst.  have broken down.   The matter is  in the hands of the Executive Committee-        of the N.U.R. but the Northampton men threaten to strike unless a settlement  is immediately        brought about.Miscellaneous.            Restaurant and Hotel Workers. A strike of  members of the British  and Allied  Waiters,.        Chefs and Employees&apos; Union is threatened over a series of demands including minimum  wages,        a 48-hour week and payment for overtime and  Sunday work.   The Employers&apos; Association        have now agreed to meet the representatives of the Union at a  joint conference to be held on        the 2nd January, when the programme put forward  by the Union will be considered.  There        has not so far been any joint meeting owing to the attitude of the Employers towards recogni-        tion, but both parties have  conferred with the Ministry of Labour with the result  that the        majority of the proprietors are now in favour of negotiation.            Theatre  Workers:  London. A dispute has occurred between the National Association of        Theatrical Employees and  the West End Managers in connection with a recent wages  award        the terms of which are opposed by the Union.  Proposals for the revision of the award as it        affects daymen, dressers, hallkeepers and firemen employed at West End Theatres were put        forward by the Union at a joint meeting held on the 29th inst.   The attitude of the Employers        towards these proposals will  be decided at a meeting of managers, and communicated  to the        men at the resumed joint conference on the 1st January.   It is considered probable that a strike-        will be averted.                                                                         R.  S.
