CP.-390.   !;&quot;)TEE FUTURE 0? C:&apos;i!ST.U;TIUQPLE.1               (lie to by Sir H^urlco Hanlcov),     I was asked to circulate any records of statements nude byMr, balfour during tho Peace Conference at Paris in regard tothe future of Constantinople. .   I have searched the various records ana have found a fewstatements by Mr. Balfour, all of which woro in favour of remove-ing tho Turks from Constantinople.     Tho following is an extract from ihe Minutes of a Meetingof tho British Empire Delegation held at E3 Rue Hitot, Paris,on Monday, May 19th, 1919., at 3.0 p.a. *     ,TKr. Balfour said that ho was in favour of fts Turks being ,$      loft their true homeland, which y^as the central block of  t      Anatolia.  They should not be placed under any mandate    I      but should have impesod upon them the sort of international      control which existed before the war.  For instance, there      had been an international body to deal with debt, of whioh      France had had the chairmanship, while the British had run      the Customs,   He w^s in favour of placing Turkey and Asia      Minor under this kind of international tutelage, in whioh      all the groat Powers could share.   He would turn the Turk      altogether out of Constantinople, and he was in favour of      leaving the Greeks in Smyrna.   His principal difficulty      lay in Article 9 of the Treaty of londoja of 1915, whioh      undoubtedly gave Italy rights in the south of jmatolia if      Prance and ^reat Britain extended or gained possessions      in the Hear East.&quot;3.  Mr. Balfourrs most important contribution to the PeaceConference on the subject cf Turkey was a Memorandum prepared byhim at the request of the Council of Four and cocmunioatod totho Turkish Delegates in Paris in June 1919, and afterwardspublished.   A oopy of this is attached.4,   In introducing this Memorandum to the Council of Pour,Mr. Balfour said that although it fully reprosontod his own viewsthere wrs some people who did not share these.  He mentioned inparticular Mr. Uontagu, the Secretary of State for India, who                                                             hadDOCUMENT IS THE P30PE3TY OV  HIS BlilgAHKIO MAJESTY&apos;S QOVgHMCTj&apos;0 1 B I I!

had sent him a long Memorandum or&quot; criticisms.    Mr.  Montagu,K/4vover, he added, represented an entirely different schooi ofpolicy and was strongly opposed to the removal of the Turks from constantinople.5.     Mr. MontaguTs comments referred to abfcve, together withMr. BaLfour&apos;s remarks on them, were oireulated to the BritishEmpire Delegation (V/.C.P.1057).   The following is an extract *from Mr. Balfour&apos;s remarks     &quot;It is quite true that the paper canternplates the     possibility of the Turks having to leave Constantinople.     I think this was. on the.whole.,a-policy, to which the ,     Conference inclined.   It certainly is the policy whioh     I advocate myself; and in these circumstances it seems     quite proper to indicate it in the reply to the Mflrmoran-     dum.   I abwnlutely deny that this ought to be regarded     as a religious issue.   Certainly,  the Allied and asso-     ciated Powers do not regard it as a question between     Christianity and Mohammedanism.........     &quot;It is quite intolerable that the residence of a Turk-     ish Caliph at a particular city should render the sov-     ereignt^ of that city immune from change and fate,     whatever outrages its rulers may commit against the     whole Asuse of civilisation God and Man.     &quot;Speaking for myself I think it a mis-use of language     to call the Mohammedan sentiment towards Constantinople     &quot;religious,&quot;   They value it as a mark of secular conquest.     When it was seised in 1453 by the Turk. Mohamaedanism had al-     ready passed its greatest era:  it is associated with nothing     that can be described as a religious mdveraent:  no great Mo ham     medan teacher has, so far as I know, ever lived there: no re-     ligious work has ever been published there or for the matter     of thatj anywhere else,  in the Turkish language:  it is     adorned by no great monument of Mohammedan architecture: it     lies, not in the centre but on the extreme verge of the Moham-     medaa world:  its whole value in Mohammedan eyes is that, it     once was Christian and now is Moslem.   This may be and is a     very natural sentiment, but it is absurd to call it &apos;relig-     ious1:- in any sense which good feeling or true liberality re-     quires us to respect.&quot;(Signed) lvl.P.A.Hankey,itehall Gardens,  S.W.1,  6th January,  19BO.
jFlDENTIAL.                                     -CP.  10M.icvisfrol g3tb,]9u   BRITISH   EMPIRE   DELEGATION.la Revise 24.6,19) ANSWER TO THE TURKISH DELKGATES.II               ,     ^              (Approved by the Council of the Principal              Allied and Associated Powers  on  23rd*             - June, 1919),       The  Council of the Principal Allied  and Associated Powers have  read with tho most careful attention the  Memorandum presented to them  by Your Excellency on June 17th, and, in  accordance with the promise - then made,  desire now to offer the following observations upon it.       In your recital  of the political intrigues which accompanied  turkey  entry  Into the war, and of the tragedies which followed it,  Your Excellency makes no attemptto excuse or qualify the crimes of - which the Turkish Government was then guilty.  It is admitted direct-  ly, or by implication, that Turkey had no causo of quarrel with tho  .  Entente Powers j that  she acted as&apos; the subservient tool&apos;of Germany;&apos;  that the  war,,begun without excuse, and conducted without mercy, was - accompanied by  massacres whose calculated atrocity equals or exceeds.  anything  in recorded hist cry.   But it is argued that these crimes&apos;  were committed  by a Turkish Government for whose misdeed3 the Turk-  ish people&apos; were not responsible,&apos; that there  was in then no element  -of religious fanaticism; that Moslems suffered from them not less  than Christians; that they were entirely  out of harmony with the  Turkish tradition, as historically exhibited in the treatment by  Turkey of,subject races; that tho -maintenance  of the Turkish Empire  is necessary for the  religious equilibrium of  the world; so that  .  policy, not less than justice4 requires  that  its territories  chviud bo   restored, undiminishod,  as  they existed  when  war broke  out.         Tho Council  can neither accept  this conclusion,  nor  the  argument  which  it  is supported. .  Thoy  do  not  indeed doubt  that  the&apos; present  Cove  mont     Turkey profoundly  disapproves of  tho policy pursued.by its pre   essors.   Even if considerations  of morality  did not  wdigh  with it, (ao^ doubtless they do) ,  considerations of oxpodioncy  would be  conclusive.  As individuals its members ha-vq  every motive as well as
? right, to repudiate the actions which have proved so ? to their country. But, speaking generally, ? must be judged by the Government which rules it, which directs its foreign policy, which controls its armies; nor can Turkey claim any relief from the legitimate consequences of this doctrine merely because her affairs, ? most critical moment in her history, had fallen into the hands of men who, utterly devoid of principle or pity, could not even command success.

It seems, however, that the claim for complete territorial restoration put forward in the Memorandum is not based merely on the ? that Turkey should not be required to suffer for the sins of her Ministers. It has a deeper ground. It appeals to the history of Turkish rule in the past, and to the condition of affairs in the Moslem world.

Now the Council is anxious not to enter into unnecessary controversy, or to inflict needless pain on Your Excellency and the Delegates who accompany you. It wishes well to the Turkish people, and admires their excellent qualities. But it cannot admit that among those qualities are to be counted capacity to rule over alien races. The experiment has been tried too long and too often for there to be the least doubt as to ? result. History tells us of many Turkish successes and many Turkish defeats:- of nations conquered and nations freed. The Memorandum itself refers to the reductions that have taken place in the territories recently under Ottoman sovereignty. Yet in all these changes there is no case to be found, either in Europe or Asia or Africa, in which the establishment of Turkish rule in any country has not been followed by a diminution of material prosperity and a fall in the level of culture; nor is there any case to be found in which the withdrawal of Turkish rule has not been followed by a growth in material prosperity and a rise in the level of culture. Neither among the Christians of Europe, nor among the Moslems of Syria, Arabia and Africa, has the Turk done other than destroy
r/horever he has ooncuored;  never has he shown himself ..blo todevelop in po.&quot;,oo whet he has won hy ear.    2*ot in this dir-eotion do his talents lie.       The obvious conclusion froa these facts would seen to bethat, since Turkey has, without the least c::ouso or provocation ,deliberately attacked the  ntonto Aovers and been defeated, she has thrown upon the victors tho heavy duty of determining thedestiny of the various populations in her hctoro&amp;cnouo Empire.This duty tho Council of the Arincipel  Hied and associated powers desire to ca.rry out, as far as ma.y be in nooordmoo with the wishes and permanent interests of the populations them-solvos.     But the Council observe with regret that the Mcmor-andum introduces in this connection a: wholly different order ofconsiclorations based on supposed religious rivalries.     ThoTurkish Empire, is, it so;ma, to be proserved unchanged, not somuch becausu this would bo to the advantage cither of the moslems or of the Christ lain 9 within its borders, but bee.use itsmaintenance is demanded by the religious sentiment of men who  &apos;never felt the Turkish yoke, or have forgotten how heavily itwoighs on thoso who are compelled to boar it.        But surely there never v:as a sentiment loss justified byfacts.   The whole course of tho ,-.ar exposes its hollovmoso.a hat religious issue is raised by ,1 struggle in v/hioh ProtestantGermany f Roman Catholic Austria, Orthodo:: Bulgaria, and MoslemTurkey, banded themselves together to plunder their neighbours?The only flavour of deliberate fanaticism perceptible in thesetrains; actions &apos;.&apos;as tho massacre of Christian  Armenians by orderof the Turkish Government.    But Your ,.::collency has pointedout that.,&apos;, at the very same time and by the very same authority,unoffending Moslems were being slaughtered in circumstances  and in numbers sufficiently 1. cargo, to mitigate,sufficiently horrible ,/if not wholly to remove, any suspicion of religious partiality.        During tho Mar, then, there was little evidence of
secretarian animosity on the part of any of the Governments, and no evidence whatever so far as the Entente Powers were concerned. Nor has anything since occurred to modify this judgment. Every man&apos;s conscience has been respected: places of sacred memory have been carefully guarded; the states and people who were ? before the War are ? still. Nothing touching religion has been altered, except the security with which it may be practised: and this, wherever Allied control exists, has certainly been altered for the better.

If it be replied that the diminution in the territories of a historic Moslem State must injure the Moslem cause in all lands, we respectfully suggest that in our opinion this is an error. To thinking Moslems throughout the world, the modern history of the Government enthroned at Constantinople can be no source of pleasure or pride. For reasons we have already indicated, the Turk was there attempting a task for which he had little aptitude, and in which he has consequently had little success. Set him to work in happier circumstances; let his energies find their chief exercise in surroundings more congenial to his genius, under new conditions less complicated and difficult, with an evil tradition of corruption and intrigue severed, perhaps forgotten, why should he not add lustre to his country, and thus indirectly to his religion, by other qualities than that courage and discipline which he has always so conspicuously displayed?
