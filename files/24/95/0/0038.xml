[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government, j jPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1919.^^HM&amp;ENTIAL.    THIS memorandum,, by the able  author of the recent note on  the Baltic states which attracted the attention of the Cabinet, has been prepared at the request  of thelatter  for circulation.   With the memorandum on Transcaucasia  it completes thetrilogy on the existing Russian situation.                                                               C. OP K.    December 20, 1919.                              SIBERIA.     A survey of the Siberian situation, both domestic and international, such as we have witnessed it developing during the last  two years, is best treated  in two main divisions, though the two are at times inextricably intertwined.  Roughly they concern the fortunes of Kolchak,  on the one hand,  and intervention under its different aspects on the other.  There is a connecting  link in the part played by the Czecho- Slovak forces, inasmuch as while they contributed to the establishment of the Kolchak Government by opening up the main line of communication, namely, the Trans-Siberian. Railway, they also supplied,  through  the dangerous position in which they found themselves, the immediate motive for inter-Allied intervention.  In addition to these main currents, there appears  quasi-independent  action on the part  of Japan, and as this may not improbably be  the most durable element arising out of the events that. have been taking place, it may not be inconvenient to treat it separately.     This survey will accordingly fall under the following heads :                                      I.           (A.)-Siberia  prior to the Bolshevik Revolution.

    A variety of cross-currents at times obscure the situation, and, while Kolchak sofar remains the dominant figure, there are a number of personalities who constantly-appear on the scene with fluctuating success and who may be destined to play a greaterrdle in the future.  The principal characters among these are the Cossack Atamans,Semenoff,  Horvat, Kalmikoff, Rozanoff, and their like, who  are little morethan condottieri, and whose power is now rapidly growing owing to the virtual collapse of the Kolchak Government:  the Social Revolutionary politicians  such as Akvsen-tieff,  Derber, and others, who  have been  temporarily  in  the background butare already  beginning to reappear :  and  the  Czech leaders, Dietrichs  (himselfa Russian) and Gaida,  whose activities are apparently at an end.   The  Kolchakperiod appears  to be over,  at least  in  the form  in  which  it  has existed  since november 1918, and  the  future of Siberia  is quite uncertain.   Intervention has not proved itself the success that  was hoped ; and when the Powers meet  to discuss theRussian problem, they will be at a, loss to know whether it should be continued ordropped.  His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, haying decided that such assistance asthey may be prepared to give to the anti-Bolshevik forces is to be given exclusively toDenikin, have to that extent disinterested themselves in the Siberian  sphere.   Theyhave decided, nevertheless, to  maintain the political influence which they have hithertoexercised, and though the  appointment of a new High Commissioner in  the place ofSir C. Eliot remains in suspense, they have no  present  intention of  abolishing the-office and so abandoning the political future to the Americans and Japanese.Stanford&apos;$ GQOCJ! Estab^ Condon.
                                       I.         (A.)-SIBERIA PRIOR TO  THE  BOLSHEVIK  REVOLUTION.     Siberia has probably never before figured so prominently before the world at large as she has done during the last two years, since she has been chiefly known as a convictsettlement on a gigantic scale with no history of any particular interest  of her own.Only once did she possess an independent ruler who thought fit to make her the centre of a great Empire.  That was in the thirteenth century, when a son of Ghenghiz Khanbecame Khan of  Siberia and  ruled over a vast territory extending  from the Wall ofChina to the frontier of Poland and  including India.   But this glorious era in herhistory was  not to last, and, though she  continued as a Khanate till the end of the fifteenth century,  it was on a considerably smaller  scale, and shortly after that Russiantraders began to appear in search of furs and Russian mapmakers came on surveyingexpeditions.   The real political connection between Siberia and Russia, however, datesonly from the sixteenth century, when Ivan the Terrible partially acquired the country(1551 to 1554). Almost immediately it began to be used as a convenient place of exile,and already  before the sixteenth century was up it was becoming the convict settlement,which it remained  till practically only two years ago.  From the time of  Ivan theTerrible, then, it fades into obscurity, relieved  practically by only one event of impor-tance, namely, the inauguration of the Trans-Siberian Railway by Alexander III in 1881.     Before  the immigration of the  Russian exiles the country  appears to have beenpeopled  by  a variety of tribes in Siberia proper,, Chukchis and Koriaks;  on theAmur, Ghilyaks;   and in Sakhalin, Ainos.  The  Mongol  portion of these embracedIslam in the thirteenth century.  Even nowadays there appear to be no more than2,300,000 genuine Aryans in Western Siberia, and  1,000,000 in Eastern.   Virtually allare agriculturists.     Under the late Russian regime the 10,000,000 inhabitants of  Siberia were parcelledout, for administrative purposes of a  political nature, into  four Governments and  sixProvinces, while [since 1870, as against 1864 in European Russia] the administration ofthe economic affairs of districts and provinces has been, and still is, to some extent in thehands of zemstVOS, or district and provincial assemblies, composed of representativeselected by the peasantry, the householders in  the towns, and the landed  proprietors.The towns have municipal  institutions of  their own, organised on nearly  the same principle as the zemstvos.   The principal towns  in order of population  are Omsk[135,000], Irkutsk  [130,000], Tomsk, with  a  university, [120,000], vladivostock-vladivostock [95,000], Krasnoyarsk [90,000], Chita [80,000].  The approximatedistance  from Vladivostock  to  Irkutsk  is  1,500 miles; from Irkutsk  to  Omsk1,000 miles; from Omsk to Cheliabinsk (on  the boundary  between European  andAsiatic Russia) is  475 miles ; and from Cheliabinsk to Moscow 1,000 miles.          (B.) SIBERIA SINCE  THE  BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION.                           (i.) The Political Situation.     The Bolshevist coup d&apos;Etat at Petrograd on the 9th November, 1917, had  at  firstbut  a slight repercussion through Siberia.   The mass of the Siberian population are agriculturists  owning their own land, and  on  that  account  Bolshevism  was unlikely  to  make  any considerable appeal.   In fact, Bolshevism  in Siberia is represented  mainly by disbanded soldiers, discharged  convicts, and certain classes of workmen, notably miners and railwaymen.   Nevertheless,  when Bolshevism came,after the manner of Russia elsewhere, the opposition appears  to have been  disunitedand based largely on  selfish  aims.   The  rich, merchants, for  instance, who had been.in the habit of leaving  the  country after making their fortunes, showed themselvesquite ready to buy off  the Bolsheviks, if it seemed  possible  in that way to avoid a fight in  their  town  and the  destruction of  their property.   The  Government officialslikewise  proved themselves unable or unwilling to take any initiative, and even theCossacks Were disappointing.  It was practically  left to the  political exiles and theprofessors of the  Tomsk University to form such public  opinion as there was andthat in the direction of Menshevism.     The first  attempts at setting  up a Government  were  made shortly  after the dissolution of the  Constituent Assembly in Petrograd by  the Bolsheviks in January1918.  A temporary Government, Socialist in complexion and  containing no repre-sentatives of the propertied classes,  was set up at Tomsk, the principal members beingPotanine  and Berber, and it was intended to  act as the legislative Siberian organ
pending the convocation of a Siberian  Constituent Assembly.   But it was destined tobe short-lived and promptly collapsed when the first  real wave of Bolshevism sweptover the country.  Some of the members moved  to Vladivostock in the east, while others remained in the west and retreated into the background.-  .   The next attempt at setting up an administration was on a much more limited andlocal scale.  General Horvat, Controller of the Chinese Eastern Railway, had been amember of the so-called  Far Eastern Committee, which had been formed some time before at Harbin to counter the activities of the  enemy prisoners.  On the decease ofthe  Tomsk Government,  Horvat thought  the moment  opportune to  set  up an administration at Harbin, and conceived the idea of working in with the Allies, whoseintervention he favoured. With him was associated  the Ataman Semenoff, who hadalready, since December 1917, begun recruiting a force  to light against the Bolsheviks.Kolchak, who had originally been Admiral of the Black Sea Fleet under the Ozaristand  Kerenski  regime  and had  subsequently emigrated to Japan,  Putiloff  andUstrugoff were  also associated with  him.   But  Horvat interests turned out to be purely personal, namely, the defeat of a Russian rival and the control of the ChineseEastern Railway.   This was in March 1918.     On the 27th March the Bolsheviks  seized Vladivostock and entered into relationswith the 250,000  German, Austrian, and  Magyar  prisoners, the  latter  of whom  hadalready become thorough-going Bolsheviks themselves.   The concentrations of these prisoners henceforth became formidable, and the Bolsheviks  it once began the despatchof the military stores at Vladivostock to their fellow-Bolsheviks inland.   With a viewto protecting foreign lives and property, a small British and Japanese force landed at vladivostock on the 5th April, but subsequently withdrew.     A Siberian Government under Derber was simultaneously organised at Vladivostockas the  direct successor of  the  Tomsk  Government, and professed to represent thezemstvos, towns, co-operative societies, and other public organisations in Siberia. Inaddition to the usual political programme, this Government favoured Allied interven-tion  and active  hostilities  against the  Bolsheviks.  This period, however, coincided with the days when Mr. Lockhart, the British agent  in Moscow, believed  it might stillbe possible to persuade the Bolsheviks to make common cause with the  Allies againstGermany,  and  accordingly  nothing was  done  in  the  way  of  encouraging activemovements against the Bolsheviks by Semenoff or  others [see D (i)].  The result wasthat  all the  larger  Siberian  centres Krasnoyarsk,  Irkutsk,  Chita,  Nikolsk,  andKhabarovsk now  began  to  be  active  foci  of  Bolshevik and German-Austrianconcentration.     The final  trial of strength between Bolsheviks and anti-Bolsheviks  came in themiddle of May, and, after a  period of disaster and uncertainty, the scale was turned bythe arrival at Irkutsk of the  Czecho-Slovaks from Russia under their commander,General DietridlS.   It was not, however, till June that the Siberian Government was able  again to come out into the open. Simultaneously, Horvat proclaimed himself the solerepresentative in office of the former Russian Provisional Government, and, in concert with Kalmikoff, Ataman of the Ussuri Cossacks, began an unpopular mobilisation.Both these Governments applied to the Allies to enter into relations with them, butthe  Allies  replied that, although they  wished to see the political and  economicreorganisation of Russia, they did not wish to interfere in her internal affairs.     In the meantime, political conferences had been taking place in Western Siberiaand  in Eastern  Russia,  and a  Government  was set  Up at Omsk  under&quot;Volcgodski, aiming primarily at the convocation of a Constituent Assembly.  later on, in  September, a conference was held  at Ufa and resulted in the formation of anAll-Russian Government, consisting of  a  Directory  Of five under the presidency of Avksentieff, which also took up its seat at Omsk.   It was to be responsible to theexisting Government at Omsk, and other Provincial Governments  which  had been setup at  such towns as  Samara, which  had been freed by  the  Czecho-Slovaks.   TheAll-Russian Government was  to hold  office  till the summoning of the  ConstituentAssembly.   Horvat at once  threw in his lot with the Omsk Government, and agreed tohold office  under them in the Far East,  while the Vladivostock Government resigned.     Contemporaneously with the rise of these local Governments,  the formation ofmilitary forces was begun by Cossack and other  officers, who were politically opposedto Socialism, and the result was that  the  Governments which  had been previouslySocialistic, especially the Government of Omsk, began to take on  a bourgeois and evenreactionary tinge, which led at once to conspiracy and counter-conspiracy.     Thus,  in September 1918, there was the curious spectacle at Omsk of two Govern^ments functioning in the same town the All-Russian  Government under Avksentieff,
mainly Socialistic in character and considering itself under the orders of the ConstituentAssembly to be summoned in January, and the Siberian Government under Vologodski,bourgeois in  character and  supported  by the Siberian army.  A  compromise was,however, arranged  on the  .r)th  November, by which the Directory and the  SiberianGovernment were amalgamated, the latter being represented by a Council of Ministers,in whose hands lay in practice the direction of affairs,  while the members of theDirectory represented  the head of the Government, and the compromise  necessarilyresulted in a weak Government.  At last the military element became exasperated, and decided on drastic  measures for  depriving the Directory of its  power.  On the night  of  the 17th November Avksentieff and two other members were  arrested  by  the  Cossack  leaders,  and  the  Council  ofMinisters  forthwith  decided  that they  should take over  thepowers of the Directory and concentrate them in  the  hands ofone  man.  In this way  Admiral Kolchak, who  had been  acting as Minister  of Marine in the Omsk Government, was elected.    Kolchak, a  young man in the early forties, had been, as already mentioned, anAdmiral under the Tsars Government.   He was in command of the Black Sea  Fleetwhen the revolution broke  out,  but soon  became involved in trouble with the sailors,who were in fact making impossible demands.  He declined to be dictated to,  resignedhis appointment and came  to Petrograd, where he arrived  just before the  Kornilovrevolt.  At the advice  of several members of the early Provisioual Government, such-as Miliukoff, he went to the Far East  so as to be in  readiness in case he were needed in  the  future for a movement to restore order.   He was  thus in Tokio when theBolsheviks  overran Siberia in March  1918.    He at once accepted  the new order inaugurated by the coup  cVEtat of 17thNovember,  proclaimed himself  &quot;Supreme  Ruler&quot;  and  Commander-in-Chief  forSiberia, the Cossack districts of  the Ural and Orenburg,  and stated that  his chiefaims were the re-establishment  of  the fighting power of the army, the triumph  overBolshevism, and the re-establishment of law and  order, &quot; so  that the people may,without hindrance, select its own  form of Government.&quot;   In practice the Socialisticelement was henceforth entirely eliminated from the administration, and  became andhas remained irreconcilable.  On the other hand Kolchak has been all along supportedby the  military,  and the principal trading  and industrial circles.  The  co-operative societies, the peasants  and the zemstvos and municipal institutions, have since  ralliedto  his support in increasing numbers.   Amongst the public at large, however, therehas been the usual apathy.    Already  in May as a result of Kolchak&apos;s early victories General Denikin had.openly placed himself  under Kolchak&apos;s  authority, and may be described  as  the Com-mander of the European wing of the latters army.&apos;  His administration at Ekaterinodaris  not to be regarded as  an  independent Government,  but  as possessing  a  purely temporary character designed to facilitate the work of the Volunteer Army until unioncould be effected with  Kolchak&apos;s troops.   The North Russian Government at Archangellikewise placed itself  under Kolchak&apos;s  authority  about this  time, and  the Russiandiplomatic  representatives of the Kerensky regime equally acknowledged his  authority and became dependent on his Government for their salaries and upkeep.    In Siberia itself, however,  the actual authority  of Kolchak&apos;s Government has beeneffective chiefly in Western and Central Siberia alone.   East of Lake Baikal it has been considerably  weaker, and there is little doubt that the principal  cause  for this  haslain in the action of the Japanese [see E].    The growth of Bolshevism (or its equivalent for practical purposes) in the  rear ofKolchak&apos;s army was certainly due in  part to the circumstances of  the  suppression ofthe Social  Revolutionaries  which  accompanied his  entry upon  office, and  the general feeling that his ultimate object was the re-establishment of a monarchical reactionaryregime.  The military rule which   apparently it  became  necessary to  establishthroughout the countryside was hardly calculated to mitigate the political discontent.Even Kolchak himself seems to have completely lost sight of the need for  keeping the mass  of the civilian population attached to him, and not merely to have  persistentlyignored the support given him by  the  co-operative societies, the zemstvos, and therepresentative institutions  generally,  but to  have  permitted attacks on them  by his subordinates and agents.  The  diplomatic representatives on the spot  have frequentlyrecommended that the Allied Governments should  endeavour to persuade Kolchak to gain  the confidence of the loyal  classes by adopting  a more liberal  attitude,  and to convene some representative organ,  such as the Siberian Duma, to which the people could  appeal.  The  suggestions  were  of  course  difficult  to  carry out  in  practice.
Kolchak  had  offered  hitherto  the  most  solid  and  durable  element that could:be   found  in  Siberia,   and  his   power  depended  on   his  steering  a  middle course  between  the  Social  Revolutionaries  and  the  military  party.   So  longas the military successes at the front continued he was able to maintain his positionand  to take drastic measures for the removal of obstacles to the rapid restoration of lawand order.   It was clearly essential, too, that the Allies should do nothing, by irritatinghim  with requests for reform or encouraging his political opponents, that might create difficulties for him while  his great battles were in progress.  But it was  stakingheavily on his success.     As events have turned out, the last battle is finally lost and all hope of retrievingthe military situation has practically vanished.  Omsk has fallen, and the Administra-tion  has moved to Irkutsk.  Kolcnak is trying to rally this defeated army.   In hisrear  the disaster is producing the domestic troubles which were only to be anticipated.Gaida, the successor of Dietrichs as commander of the Czecho-Slovaks, attempteda coup  d&apos;Etat at Vladivostock on the 17th November, and  called  for the  overthrowof the  Kolchak  Government, the  cessation of   civil  war, and  peace negotiationswith the Soviet Government.   Gaida&apos;s movement was, indeed, crushed by Rozanoffon   behalf  of Kolchak ;  but  the  subterranean  hostility  to  the latter continuesjust  the same, and may at any moment break out. afresh, all the  more as, if the reports are true, the retreating armies are  murdering all the inhabitants with a democraticreputation  and burning their villages on the mere suspicion of political  disloyalty.The  Government itself has taken fright and is reported to be contemplating a changein the  administration.    The present intention  is  apparently to  make  Dietrichsadministrator of Eastern Siberia, with Semenoff under him as Commander-in-Chief ofa newly-formed  military district at  Chita, Horvat as commander of the  ChineseEastern Railway area, and someone else at Vladivostock.   The Socialists, on the otherhand, are once more raising their heads and are envisaging the idea  of a federated and self-governing  Siberia with  all power  locally in the hands  of  the  zemstvos andmunicipalities.  The general opinion seems  to be that the Government can onlysurvive if  it forthwith convokes a national assembly with legislative powers.  But theresult of the cataclysm has been to drive the peasantry towards Bolshevism as the only hope of obtaining peace.   The only  evident thing is that the Kolchak  regime ismoribund,  if  not already defunct,  and  that a new era is opening with  boundlesspossibilities of evil.   &apos;  -                      (ii.) The  Military  Situation.     At the opening of this year the Siberian Army, numbering about 97,000 men, held a line at an average distance of 100 miles  west of the Ural Mountains (i.e., in european russia), and covering Orenburg and Uralsk in the south.     Spasmodic operations were carried out during January : on the northern portion ofthe front the fighting resulted in no important gains  on either side, but in the souththe Bolsheviks made considerable progress.  By the end  of January they had capturedSterlitamak, Orenburg, and Uralsk, their maximum advance attaining a depth of 150 miles.     In  February the Red A rmy made slight progress on the northern front;  in, thesouth they  pushed on  beyond  Orenburg  and captured Orsk, thus  regainingpossession of the Tashkent Railway.     On the 1st March the  Siberian Army took the offensive on thewhole front, having for  its objective in  the centre and  south  the  line of  the RiverVolga, while in the north the 1st Army was to move on Viatka  and Kotlas witha view to joining hands with the Archangel forces under General Ironside.     The plan was too  ambitious  and  impossible of accomplishment by  admiral kolchak&apos;s force of 100,000 men, scattered, as it was,, over a front of  700 miles.   .  At the outset  the  offensive achieved a considerable measure  of  success;  by the1st May the Siberians had  advanced to a depth of 125 miles in the north and i!50 miles in the centre, while in  the south they had regained nearly all  the  lost ground in theOrsk-Orenburg-XJralsk  area,  thus  closing  the  road to  Turkestan and central Asia.  The  number of  prisoners captured by  Admiral Kolchak&apos;s forces was,  however,  insignificant in  comparison with their territorial gains. As  already stated, the plan of operations was ill-conceived, and as a result its success was short-lived.   The most elementary principles  of war  appear to  have  been disregarded,;;reserves were  committed to the battle at  its commencement, no attention was paid tothe vital matter  of safeguarding communications, and  the intelligence service wasinefficient in the extreme.   Early in May  the Red Army counter-attacked in consider-
:able strength;  the  Siberians were  taken completely unawares  and  compelled  toretreat.  By the end of June the Bolsheviks  had regained all the lost ground, andby  the  beginning of August  the  Siberians  had  been  drivenentirely out of European Russia and  East of the Ural Mountains.     Their retirement continued uninterruptedly during August, and by the end  ofthat month they had reached a line a few  miles west  of the Ishim  River, havingretreated over 600 miles since the beginning of May.  It is remarkable that after thisunparalleled retreat Kolchak should have been able  not  only to check  the  enemy&apos;s. advance, but  to regain the initiative.   Early  in  September the SiberianArmy  again took the Offensive; they advanced on the northern front  to anaverage depth of 100 miles, driving the  enemy back  to the line of the Tobol River.This success greatly improved the Siberian moral; and it  was hoped  that Kolchakwould be able to regain the line  Oheliabinsk-Ekaterinburg before the winterset in.     Meanwhile, the enemy had scored an overwhelming success in the  Orenburg-Uralsk  area.  Early in September they decisively defeated Kolchak&apos;s  southernarmy,  again securing complete control over the Tashkent Railway.     In the north, also, the Siberians,  far from continuing their advance, were unableto maintain themselves on the line of  the Tobol.  About the middle of October  theenemy attacked and completely turned the  tables.  His success  was due, apparently,not to superior numbers, but to his ascendency in discipline brought about by whole-sale executions in the ranks of the Red Army immediately prior to the  resumption ofthe offensive.                                    &apos;     The Siberian army once more took to flight;  Omsk  fell  to the  enemy onthe 15th November, and, according to their latest claims, they are now 190 miles east of it.   It is not known how  far the Siberians have been able to  extricate  tkem-selves, but, if there  is any truth in the enemy&apos;s claim to have  captured 50,000-prisoners since the middle  of October, the former  have lost 50 per  cent,  of theireffectives.  Very little  news has  been  received since  the fall  of  Omsk  and  thepresent situation is obscure, but it seems probable that the Siberians will attempt todefend the line of the river Ob.                        (iii.) Causes of Kolchak&apos;&apos;s failure.     Kolchak&apos;s  failure  has been in the main  due to  a combination of  militaryincompetence  and corruption with political ineptitude.     As just stated,  in  so far as his military operations were concerned,  the mostelementary principles of war appear to have been disregarded.  His advisers,  his staff,and his officers generally have shown an almost  unparalleled incapacity for war, andmoreover,  appear never to have been  properly impressed with the gravity of  thesituation.  But there have been considerably worse  features in the story  even than this, and there is clearly a long  record of maladministration and malpractices  which account  for much of the trouble.  Indeed, they cast a  lurid light on the  Russiancharacter, even when in distress, and leave us with little wonder that there  is neverstability In any Russian situation.     It is notorious that Russians will never pull together, even under the most criticalcircumstances.  But the spectacle of disunion under the Kolchak regime has been more  lamentable than usual.   Erom the  very beginning there have  been endlessbickerings between him and his generals, and between the generals themselves, andat ^jtimes open rupture.   We have had  Semenoff and Ivanoff-Rinoff pulling one way,Rozanoff another, Horvat still another, along with complete mistrust between Kolchakand his actual Chiefs of the Staff and Commanders-in-Chief.  Gaida, who was his firstprominent Commander, and  the most popular  man  in  Siberia,  was clearly out of sympathy  with him from the first  on  political grounds.  Like all the Czechs, hisleanings were  pronouncedly democratic, and he disapproved throughout of what  heconceived to be Kolchak&apos;s reactionary leanings.   But early in July Kolchak openlyquarrelled with him, accusing him of demoralising the army and corrupting it withBolshevism by the introduction  of Social  Revolutionaries, &quot; the enemies of  Russia.&quot;Gaida retorted that the fault lay  with Kolchak&apos;s other generals like Lebedeff, his Chiefof the Staff, whom he  accused of being pro-Japanese, and of robbing the  country.The result of the quarrel was that Gaida was dismissed.     Next came Dietrichs, who commanded the army from the middle of July till thebeginning of November. Then he in his turn fell into violent conflict  with  Kolchak the  result of an intrigue carried on  against him by Lebedeff and Sakharoff.  Dietrichsresigned, and  Sakharoff is now installed in his place.   He has since been superseded.T&quot;^ &apos;.  1 -&apos; rr -----------  ----  ............
     Kolchak&apos;s General Headquarters, in fact, lias  been a hot-bed&apos;of intrigue, and&apos;  \crowded with embusques of the worst type.   Even at the front the higher officers appear-to have been mainly engaged in trying to get away from it and obtain appointmentsat Omsk, while a large  proportion  of those that remained  abandoned themselves topleasure.   We heard, for instance, of a military train, in which were the staff of anarmy corps, containing as many women as staff officers.     The condition of the junior officers has been no better. In success they have beencorrupt and pleasure-loving; in  defeat they  have been demoralised and cowardly;  in both they have been given over to drunkenness.   The men have openly said that the peasants were made to  do all the fighting  and that  none of the  Intelligentsia were  .within  miles  of the front.  Misbehaviour, carelessness, and  dishonesty on the part ofthe  officers, and particularly of the staff, has naturally led  to complete chaos in thematter of transports and supplies.  There has been constant congestion at the base anddistribution has been at a standstill.   But for the efforts of  the Inter-Allied RailwayBoard, there would have been practically no railway service at all.     A second source of&apos; trouble  lay in  the reactionary political tendencies and harshmethods of Kolchak&apos;s nominees.   Almost everywhere he appointed Military Governorswho showed themselves totally unable  or unwilling to distinguish between genuineBolsheviks  and  merely  democratically-disposed  peasantry  and  others.   Rozanoff,Ivanoff-Rinoff,  and  Romanovski were types of  this kind, and  they set themselvessystematically to repress both Social Revolutionaries and officials of the  Co-operative societies with the utmost severity.  Ivanoff-Rinoff issued an order in his districts thathostages were to be taken from Bolshevik&apos; sympathisers and that ten of these hostageswere to be shot for  each act of terrorism by the Bolsheviks.  At Krasnoiarsk Rozanoffissued a number of orders for deaths without trial for giving ^assistance  to theBolsheviks, one of the orders stating that  the Bolsheviks in  prison  would be held ashostages and twenty shot for every crime committed in their district.  Even as late asNovember we have  a report of twenty-seven persons, not apparently Bolsheviks, beingshot for political offences.\   Nor in the purely political realm has  anything ever been done to remedy thegenuine grievances  of the civilian population or to take  any  account of their politicalaspirations.  In particular, Kolchak&apos;s disregard of the  zemstvos  led to the greatestestrangement of political opinion.     The zemstvp system corresponds roughly, with the local government organisations which exist in England at the present day.   The  zemstvos are representative bodies-  [elected by the people themselves, and perform approximately the same functions as in   jEngland fall to the share  of the county, town, urban and district councils.  Before.   jthe Russian revolution the zemstvos were probably more reliable instruments  for theexpression of  public opinion than the Duma, which was  more  easily controlled fromabove, and could be dispersed whenever it seemed likely to become at all  dangerous to;the bureaucracy.   The zemstvo system since its introduction has enjoyed both at home,and  abroad a  reputation unique among Russian institutions.  It has  always  beenquoted as a saving grace whenever the shortcomings of  the Russian Government have.come under discussion.   &apos;:  When the Omsk Government had succeeded in establishing itself firmly throughoutSiberia, Admiral Kolchak  issued a  series  of -declarations promising government on,strictly democratic lines, and implying that he was opposed to the limitation of publicrights.  It was quite natural that in the selection of members of his Government and!of his administration Admiral Kolchak should for.the most part choose men of his ownpolitical tendencies.  It was equally natural  that the Government  should strive toobtain greater power by applying the principle of centralisation of authority.  But the extensive  application of the principle was  bound to lead to general discontent.   TheSocial Revolutionaries and, to a certain extent, the Social Democrats, resented,  whatthey considered the excessive influence of the Extreme Right, and in the course, of timethe zemstvos,  whose members largely belonged  to these two parties, came into open  .disagreement with  the Government, which found itself  obliged  to  adopt measurescalculated  to  reduce  the; influence  of these  organs of  local  administration.  Thisdiscontent  reached its  climax  in  February  1911),  when several members  of theExecutive  Committee  of.: the  zemstvo  of  the Maritime Provinces  were  arrested and  without  trial removed from Vladivostock on  suspicion of  active  propaganda against   the   Omsk  Government.   These   men   were   subsequently  released,and  a  commission of;  Judicial:  Inquiry  set  up to  investigate the  charges.But; the  harm was done,  and  the  action  of the  Government,  combined  withindiscriminate punitive measures against  the peasantry, has  merely had the effect of/
 manufacturing Bolshevism right and left and weakening Kolchak&apos;s authority where it: was most needed to ensure his military success.   The recruiting has steadily fallen off,. the peasants have resisted conscription altogether, desertions at the front have been numerous, while the lied troops are prevented from coming over to the Siberian side because they are fairly certain that they will be shot if they do.  ,   &quot; In addition to all  this, the financial and economic situation has been as bad as it could reasonably be.   At the present moment. there are&apos;said to be over thirty different forms of currency in  Eastern Siberia, from a Romanoff rouble to the  picture  on  a cigarette box, and in many places  the latter token is  more valuable than  the former. The confusion  has latterly been increased by extensive forgeries, and  the  Minister of Finance has persistently declined  to listen to the proposals  for reform put forward by our  own financial expert on the spot.   The depreciation  has led to an enormous increase in prices, which  are now far higher than they  were under the  Bolshevik regime of last  year.   No improvement has been possible until  the transport problem could be solved, and that, in  its turn, has been complicated by the dishonesty of the officials  at VTadivostock, who for  corrupt  speculative purposes  of  their  own  have prevented the removal of supplies from the base.   Besides this, wholesale requisitioning of stocks by the Government has brought imports automatically to a stop, while, with the loss of the  Urals, the whole productive capacity of  the country has  been paralysed and the railway has become  dependent upon  supplies from  abroad.  The influx  of refugees, for whom neither  accommodation nor occupation were available, has further increased the chaos, and there is now practically a complete absence of  clothing and: other articles of necessity.     Nor do Kolchak&apos;s troubles  end there.  He has had external difficulties to  face, too, from  Japanese, Americans, and  Czechs alike.   The former have consistently undermined  his  authority  by their support of the Atamans, and  of the reactionary parties, while to the latter he has appeared an impenitent anti-democrat.  He has thus, both in his foreign and domestic relations, fallen hopelessly between two stools.     Yet in himself he  is admittedly an honest and perfectly broad minded man.   He is as brave as a lion, but at the same time evidently as obstinate as a mule.  He has  none of the steadiness which has been Denikin&apos;s chief asset, and he has the misfortune of possessing an  ungovernable  temper.   He was  not  strong  enough for the post  of dictator, a post which he did not himself covet.   There is no reason to believe that he has not been quite sincere in his democratic views, but like other Russians  he realised that too much talk about democracy has been the bane  of Russia, and has resented our efforts to get democratic  statements out of him.   He recognised, though far too  late in the  day, that political concessions  were  necessary, and in July opened  an economic congress of the principal districts and institutions of Siberia,  But  he spoilt it at once- by  instructing it to confine  its attention to economic  questions.  Only  under the influence of panic last  month did his Government at last promulgate a law convoking a Peasant and Cossack Assembly.     He has suffered since the  very beginning from being surrounded by ex- bureaucrats- of the old Tsarist regime, who have consistently hampered him at every turn, and  from lack of  patriotism and  war-tiredness among  all classes.  He has readily acknowledged that things were bad, but has  been  too weak to remedy them.   He has known that a proper agrarian programme was the  only means of  gaining the support of the peasantry, yet all he has done has been to issue temporary decrees leaving  them in  possession of their,land, but  giving them  no security for the future.  He has continually fallen  back on a Constituent Assembly of  an uncertain future for  the  permanent  settlement, and has  thus left  the impression that the  much-wished-for  reforms  are dependent on unknown factors.     But the main cause of his failure has been the arbitrary actions of  his lieutenants,. the corruption of their subordinates and the economic chaos.  The.wonder is that he had lasted so long.         (iv.) The Relations betireen Admiral Kolchak and the Allied Powers.     The relations between the Powers and Kolchak were defined in despatches to our Representatives abroad on the  17th  April, 1919, as follows   Admiral Kolchak  enjoysthe nominal goodwill of His Majesty&apos;s Government, of the French Government, and, inalesser degree, of the Japanese Government, together with a general expectation of material assistance from all three.   The attitude of the United States Government, on the otherhand, is  undoubtedly, in practice at least, neutral, not to  say unsympathetic.&quot;   The&quot;goodwill&quot; referred to was conveyed to Kolchak in  January 1919 by the British High
Commissioner in these terms : &quot; As your Excellency has assumed the control at Omsk,Plis Majesty&apos;s Government  desire to express their warm  sympathy with every effort toestablish a free Russian Government on the basis of public confidence.   Nothing short ofthis can restore  Russia to her proper position among the nations of the world, or  enable her to take her full share in the work, of  civilisation.&quot;  The object of this declaration was to give a stimulus to Kolchak  and his troops, on the one hand, and, on the other,to make it  more  difficult  for the Japanese to promote  the encouragement of other political centres  of  government under ambitious leaders.    The  next  step, namely,  the  recognition of Kolchak&apos;s  Government, which  wasclosely allied with that of  material assistance, became the  subject of discussion from april onwards.  Besides the practical issue  of the security of its position, there were two main objections to affording  it  recognition: (a)  Admiral Kolchak stands for a&quot;United Indivisible Russia&quot;;  (b)  if not Admiral  Kolchak,  at least his  immediateentourage are in favour of restoring a monarchy in Russia [see B (i) ].   It was thereforeclearly necessary to attach  two conditions to  recognition:  (i) that the  assistance givento Kolchak for  the sole purpose of the  war against the Bolsheviks  should never beused  to bring  the ex-Russian Border  States into a Russian Federation by force;(ii) that there should be no attempt to impose a monarchy on the Russian people as aresult of Kolchak&apos;s victories in the field.   One means of meeting these difficulties wasto recognise  the Kolchak Government merely as a Provisional Government for Siberia,and not as  a Government for &quot;All Russia; and this view  has  prevailed with  HisMajesty&apos;s Government  every  time  that  the expediency of  recognising Kolchak  has arisen.    The question came up before the PeaCe Conference in May, and a note was addressed by the Powers jointly to Kolchak and his associates enquiringwhether they would agree to certain conditions, upon the acceptance of which the powers would render assistance. These conditions included: (a) the election of a ConstituentAssembly at Moscow, and, pending the  election, the convocation of  the ConstituentAssembly of-1917 ; (b) free elections in the areas controlled by Kolchak, Denikin, &amp;c,for all legally constituted Assemblies ; (c) no attempt to  revive the special privilegesof any class  in  Russia;  (d) recognition of Poland and Finland; (e) &quot; if a solution ofthe question of  the  relations between the  Baltic  States,  the  Caucasus,  and Trans-caspian territories  in Russia, is  not speedily reached  by agreement, a settlement should  be made  in  consultation  with the  League  of  Nations&quot;;  (/) the  PeaceConference to determine the  future of the Roumanian part of  Bessarabia; (g) russia to join the League  of Nations as soon as its Government should be  constituted on a democratic basis;  (h) Kolchak to abide by a previous declaration concerning Russia&apos;national debts.    Admiral Kolchak replied that he accepted the Allied  conditions, with reservationsregarding the  immediate  meeting of the  Constituent  Assembly of 1917 and thequestion of Bessarabia, and the Peace Conference expressed themselves satisfied withhis assurances and  promised further supplies.   Nevertheless Kolchak s Governmentremained unrecognised to the bitter disappointment and  discomfiture  of his followerswho had counted on the  Exchange of Notes being a prelude to recognition.   WhenKolchak replied, however, his armies were in full retreat, and the moment was hardlypropitious to confer a privilege which might easily have proved an empty one almost assoon as it was conferred.  Nor indeed  was any further action taken to give effect to theagreement in principle as to  the relations between the future Russia and the border States,and indeed such arrangement as was arrived at in the Exchange of Notes has remained a dead letter ever since, pending a general consideration of the Russian problem as awhole by the Allied Powers which has not yet taken place.   M. Sazonoff, on behalf ofthe Russian  Committee in Paris, made a further attempt to get the question taken up,and on the 20th September appealed in this  sense to M.  Clemenceau, as President ofthe Peace Conference, but without result.  Finally the point was once  more consideredby His  Majesty&apos;s Government six  weeks ago, when the tide of war seemed to havedefinitely turned in favour  of Kolchak, Denikin, and Yudenitch simultaneously, on theground  that it would be expedient that they  should gain  the victories which for a fewdays  looked  inevitable with the  full blessing  of  the Allied Powers, and  not  fallpromptly under  German influence as a result of the Allies holding aloof at a criticalmoment.  A wiser policy, however, prevailed and has been  fully justified by events.
11169                                       ii   &apos;                      (0.) THE  CZECHOSLOVAKS. ;    The Czecho-Slovak forces in Russia which have played so prominent a part in the- history of the last two years are a composite body, consisting of Ozecho-Slovaks resident: in Russia before  the  war who entered  the Russian army, Czecho-Slovak prisoners of war who enlisted in * the Serbian voluntary division in the Dobrudja, and -Czecho-Slovaks in the Austrian  army who  voluntarily surrendered to  the Russians. Their numbers were subsequently considerably swelled  during their journey across Siberia by the Czecho-Slovak prisoners of  war whom they found on their route.   At the  beginning the superior officers were exclusively Russian,  the subaltern officers exclusively Czech.  Up to the time of their departure from the front the chief command was held by General Chokorov, but it was then taken over by General  Dietrichs, his  chief of  the staff, formerly quartermaster-general to  the Russian General  Head- quarters.     After the Treaty  of  Brest-Litovsk,  when it became clear that  Russia and the- Ukraine. would not fight  Germany any longer, an  agreement was  made with  the Allied Governments that these  Czecho-Slovak forces should join  the  Allies on the Western front.  On the lb&apos;th February, 1918, the promise of a free  passage through Russia  was  given  by   the  Bolshevik   Commander-in-Ckief,  and   a  formal agreement  entered   into  with  the  Bolshevik   Government  in MOSCOW On  the  26th  March.  The  Bolshevik  Government, however, after- wards broke  faith  at the instigation of the  Central Powers.  The best chance for the Czecho-Slovaks was then to get away across Siberia, and the journey began forthwith via Kursk, Penza, Samara and Cheliabinsk.  The total strength of the forces at starting were 42,500 men, and this  number was increased as they proceeded by fresh recruits from among the Czecho-Slovak prisoners of war, reaching eventually about 60,000 men.     A diversion was created  early in May by a project  apparently conceived by the French, and  approved  by the Soviet Government, that, while the Czecho-Slovaks east of Omsk should proceed to Vladivostock, the detachments west of Omsk should be sent to France via Murmansk and Archangel.   This idea of a concentration of Czecho- Slovak  troops in Northern Russia strongly appealed to us, and  negotiations wore consequently carried on with Trotzki, through Mr. Lockhart, with a view to securing the passage for them.   Bolshevik opposition and obstruction proved, however, too great, and  in the end the  project had to be abandoned [June 30].     Meanwhile on  the 26th May the. first echelon of Ozecho-Slovak artillery arrived at Irkutsk.  They were armed  with  only thirty carbines and some grenades, having left the bulk of their arms  bv agreement with the Bolsheviks at Penza.   A demand was made for the surrender of their remaining arms, retained for self-defence, by a large force of. Red Guards,  and whilst the unarmed Czecho-Slovaks were discussing the situation on the. railway platform within the period of 15 minutes granted to them for the surrender, a machine gun opened fire on them from the station  building.   With the  aid of their.grenades  they mastered the  situation, disarmed their opponents,  and  succeeded in overcoming additional forces, which were sent against them by the local Soviet.     Already  by  the   6th  June,  the  Czecho-Slovaks   were  in possession of the stations  between Omsk and Krasnoyarsk, while the activities, of their compatriots in European Russia met with corresponding success [seeB(i)].  Quickly their control extended  eastwards to Nijni-Udinsk, and Penza in the  west,  Irkutsk  remaining in  Bolshevik hands  till  the  13th July.    On the 28th June, Vladivostock passed under  Czecho-Slovak control,  and they at once  took  steps for the  preservation  of order by disarming  opposing forces. By the 6th July they began to move out on Nikolsk, with Harbin and Habarovsk as- ultimate objectives. Semenoff wanted to advance on Chita with the object of  drawing off the Bolshevik forces, but General Horvats promised reinforcements did not appear.. By the 4th July, Nikolsk  was taken by the Czechs, and the  Bolsheviks retired on Habarovsk.   By the 11th July the sweep of Czecho-Slovak  activity ranged from  the Volga to Nijni-Udinsk.   They had won the sympathy of the peasants,  and  the United States officials on the spot, who had been opposed to  the idea of intervention against the Bolskeyiks, now considered it opportune in the  interests of  the Czechs.  Broad as the  range of Czecho-Slovak control was,  for the time being, large  groups were nevertheless isolated from their comrades in the east by the Bolsheviks and the enemy- prisoner  forces concentrated at  Chita and  Habarovsk.   They had very insufficient supplies of munitions, and  no prospect  of increasing  them, whilst  of provisions and       [1625]&apos;&quot; -                                                    C  2     1
                                        12clothing for the winter they had none.  Their  numbers  further were limited andsubject to  constant attrition through enemy attacks and sheer physical exhaustion.   a stage came when it was evident that the whole movement must be abortive, and theiranabasis end in  disaster if relief could not be provided.     On the  22nd  July, General  Dietrichs  decided, in  view  of the gravity of thesituation,  that  he  must despatch  all his forces at  Vladivostock  westward  again,to  the  relief of his compatriots cut off in Central Siberia.  But on the 3rd  august the decision was taken by His Majesty&apos;s  Government to extend  military  help  tothe Czecho-Slovaks [see D (i)].  The Czech forces  in Eastern Siberia numbered 14,000at  this  time, of whom  half were  in  the  region of Vladivostock  and Nikolsk ;  afurther 11,000  were  on the  Manchurian border, and  3,000  occupied  Irkutsk.  at every  point  they  were greatly outnumbered, and faced  with armament heavier than anything they  had themselves.   In the pocket of a  German officer  captured  bySemenoff was found a copy of  a wireless message of the 7th June, from the GeneralStaff in Berlin, directing that all prisoners should be organised as regular  units, with pay, promotion,  &amp;c, as in Germany, for complete co-operation  with the  Bolsheviksagainst the Czechs.     The results of the Allied intervention were fehVvery rapidly.  The  forces underSemenoff were enabled to advance,  thus relieving the pressure on the Czechs in Trans-Baikalia, who took Verkhni-Udinsk on the 22nd August,  whilst an advance was  made towards Habarovsk.   By the 4th  September railway communicationhad  been  again  re-established  along  the  whole  Trans-siberian railway, and with Habarovsk  in Japanese hands, the  sole  remaining Bolshevikcentre of resistance was Blagovestchensk, which fell on the 19th September.     The Czechs, then, having secured  their position, have remained on in Siberia,and under General Gaida, who replaced  Dietrichs on the latter&apos;s  appointment  to command the Russian armies, have played a considerable role both in the political andmilitary sphere.   Their chief function has been to guard the lines of communication,in  particular the main railway.   Their desire to return  home, however,  has  beenconstantly  growing, and, after prolonged discussions as to the means and cost of their transport, arrangements are at last  being made to repatriate  them.  In accordancewith an agreement  made in Paris  in July 1918,  we  are pledged to bear the cost  oftheir repatriation, but  the Americans have offered at the last moment to share it with us and we  are about to accept their offer.  The matter has, however, hung fire so longthat, with the defeat of the Kolchak armies  and the probable collapse of the Govern-ment, the Czechs are once more engaged in political activity.  Their representative atOmsk has even asserted that they will be prepared  to go to the front if ordered by their government.  Politically they are  clearly inclined to  throw  in their lot  with the democratic elements, and have issued a  manifesto to the effect  that they are. out  of sympathy with Kolchak.   They still desire to return  home, but have informed theGovernment  that, so long; as they remain, they cannot undertake to refrain from inter-vening  in internal affairs, and that events may compel them to abandon a passive role.Their unrest has, in fact, already [see B (i)] broken out  in an abortive coup d&apos;Etat byGaida at Vladivostock with the result that the Kolchak party are urging His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take him back to his country.     The departure  of the, Czechs will create  an awkward  problem, inasmuch as thelines of communication will thereby either have to be taken  over by the Russians, whoare incapable, or to be  left unguarded, or to be taken over by the Japanese.   This lastalternative  would clearly increase Japans stake in  the country,  and it is thought thatit is this prospect which  may  induce the Japanese to, supply the  shipping for the czechs&apos;removal.                                      III.                             (D.)-INTERVENTION.  &apos;                   V     (i.) American and japan/aese.     The policy of intervening with a military force, in particular Japanese,  in EasternSiberia was first discussed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in December 1917.  Therewere then  two points  at issue [a) the protection  of foreigners; (b) the protection ofthe vast stocks  of war material at Vladivostock.   Later on a third  point was added,namely,  the  need of spreventing Germany from  seizing the  Siberian harvests andsupplementing the  supplies from  the Ukraine; and, finally, the hope of jeventuallybeing  able to re-establish  the Eastern front against the Germans was never  quite
abandoned.    The argument against intervention was  a strong one, namely, thatif  the  Russians  apprehended  that  Japan  was to  be loosed against  them, theywould make  peace  with Germany, and  even possibly fight  against us with her.Nevertheless,  an enquiry was made&apos;at Washington and Tokyo whether the hour of intervention  had  arrived.   The United States Government replied that  they them--.selves had  decided  nothing,  but that  in the event  of  German control  of  Russiabecoming probable, Japan would, they had been told, mobilise and  take the necessary steps  to counteract  such  a  movement   Further enquiry  at Tokyo elicited  theinformation that Japan  could not undertake  the  duty of  guarding the siberian railway  from  Vladivostock to Moscow,  but would  be willing to discuss  a more modest operation  to Harbin, or even to the junction of the  Amur  Railway; alsothat American participation  would be unpopular in Japan.  On the 31st December theUnited States Government were told that His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped they might see their way to co-operation in the event of the Japanese taking protective military measuresof their own; but the United States Government intimated that they were averse from.-either solitary intervention by Japan or combined intervention by Japan and America.The Japanese thereupon took offence, professed to  be pained at His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment&apos;s disapproval of  solitary  action by Japan, and  expressed the  hope that theywould trust  her to  intervene at Vladivostock, especially as enemy action in EastRussia and  on  the  East Siberian littoral was to her a matter of peculiar and intimateconcern.     There was indeed much to be said for inviting Japan to take independent actionon  behalf of  the  Allies, if  she thought it desirable to do so;  it would have  shown-our appreciation of Japanese feeling and confidence in Japan, and would commit hermore  deeply  in  the  world  struggle  against  Germany  and German  influence.Accordingly  His Majesty&apos;s  Government decided to  propose  at  Paris,  Rome and washington that Japan  should  be invited  to act as the mandatory ofthe Allies  for the special duty of protecting the Siberian Railway and resistingGerman  penetration  [January 26&quot;, 1918j.  The French  immediately agreed,  but theItalians hesitated, and  President Wilson confined  himself to a promise that he wouldgive the  matter careful consideration as to the military advantages to be expected.Subsequently the United States  Government declared that Russia would not welcomeany interference in her affairs,  which must  therefore  be considered inopportune forthe present, but, if intervention should ultimately become unavoidable, any militaryexpedition should  be undertaken by international co-operation and not by any onemandatory Power.     Meanwhile the Ataman SemenofF had equipped  an expedition  ofhis own in Manchuria to fight against the Bolsheviks  in Eastern Siberia andwas scoring some initial successes [see (0)].  The Japanese had from the beginningshown a remarkable interest in his organisation [see (E)], secretly supplying him witharms and ammunition, and late on  the 28th February the Japanese consul at  Harbinavowed the Japanese action  to his British colleague, and  said that Japan was ready tosend  an expedition  to assist  him, but  would  not  occupy  Siberia.  Yet  almostsimultaneously the Japanese Government  suggested  that, if  England and  Franceagreed, Japan  could go  ahead  without the consent of America, certainly to Irkutsk,perhaps  further ;  and  again, they hinted  at the possibility of  Japan  breaking fromthe Entente  in  order to be free to  intervene in Siberia  and secure what  she  wantedin the Far East, and  even to come to an understanding  with Germany on the  ground of a.common hostility to Bolshevism.         .                        ..    At this point [March] the Bolsheviks unconditionally surrendered  to the Germansat Brest-Litovsk, and, though the Bolsheviks stated that they still intended  to organiseresistance to German aggression in spite of their peace treaty, His  Majesty&apos;s government decided that immediate Allied action in Siberia had become imperative, far  preferablyby Japan acting as mandatory rather than alone, and if possible  on a direct invitation from  the  Soviet Government, to obtain which Mr. Lockhart&apos;s efforts were  henceforthdirected.  The Japanese Government, however, now executed  a volte-face, and. saidthat it would be difficult for Japan to act as mandatory for the Powers, if she could not count on  the United States for assistance in money, steel, &amp;c.   President Wilson wastherefore  asked by  us to  give  material as well  as  moral  support to Japaneesintervention, without  which Japan would  not  move;  and  we  pointed out that-Japanese  intervention  was  useless  unless it was  carried  far  enough to deny  theGermans the immense  supplies available from Western  Siberia; and that an  expedi-tion getting thus  far would also cover any German advance upon Turkestan  to theperil of India..   President Wilson, however, remained^unmoved.
     During the following month [April], though unceasing efforts to convert President Wilson  continued, the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government was mainly diverted to &apos;the task of endeavouring to extract an invitation from Trotsky, or at least to obtain his assent to Japanese intervention, and at o:ie time it looked as though this might be effected. In fact, on the 23rd April Mr. Loekhart reported from  Moscow that, if Lenin could be assured that the Allies would not seek to destroy the Soviet form of government, but would  loyally co-operate with  it and guarantee  the  independence of Russian territory, there was good reason to  believe that  he would not refuse any reasonable offer from  the  Allies.    So things  went on with no result; the Soviet Government merely played with the idea of  intervention  for purposes  of their  own, and President  Wilson still remained, immovable.     Thus four fruitless months passed, in which both Japan and America alternately gave and withdrew their assent to the various proposals put forward  by the Western Powers.  At one moment a grudging assent was offered by the United States, only to be withdrawn  two days afterwards ; at another moment the  Japanese, who had  never disguised their intention to intervene alone,  if necessary, indicated their willingness to proceed on the invitation of Great Britain and  France and without  America.   But, after a  change of Government, this suggestion was withdrawn, and  Japan declared that intervention on a substantial scale was impossible without  the help of money and metals from America.  His Majesty&apos;s Government exhausted all possible arguments to induce the United States to  consent to intervention, but without success.  With equal insistency  they  pressed on  Japan,  first,  a  scheme  of &quot;mixed&quot; intervention,  and, when that proved distasteful,  invited her, as mandatory of  the  Allied fPowers to undertake  the  duty alone again without success.  It may be that  domestic and political  reasons prevented  both countries from acting as we urged them to do; but there  was clearly no  point at which intervention would  have been possible without the risk of breaking (a) with the Japanese, if we had insisted  on a &quot; mixed &quot; expedition, or (&amp;) with the Americans, if we had been  able and willing to persuade the  Japanese to act without  the consent of the United States Government.     In the meantime, the military situation on the Western front was growing steadily more critical, and it was becoming vital to deny Russian supplies to the  Central Powers, and, by renewing the Allied menace to their Eastern frontiers, to stop the flow of their troops to France before Germany had time to consolidate her hold on Russian  resources and Russian territory.  Fresh efforts had therefore to be made towards bringing about intervention.     The visit  to Washington  of Viscount Ishii, the  new Japanese Ambassador to the United States,  towards the end of April, afforded a fresh opportunity for conversations with President Wilson, who was showing himself more favourably disposed towards intervention, apparently owing to the reports  that were coming in of Trotsky&apos;s good dispositions.   But three weeks later the President still remained of the opinion  that the advantages which  might be gained by intervention would be far outweighed by the disadvantages.   Meanwhile we were informed by the  Japanese Government that they were prepared  to recede  from  the original position which  they had  taken up, namely, that any expedition into Siberia should be solely Japanese, and that while still holding  the view that,  since Japan  was to  contribute  most of  the  troops,  their movements should be controlled by  Japanese Generals, they were prepared to give favourable consideration to any plan that  might be proposed for  Allied co-operation. [May 3.]  A few days  later  the Japanese Government declared that in any case they, only  contemplated intervening to prevent German penetration to the Pacific  coast, and that intervention to the extent of sending a force to Cheliabinsk &quot; was an entirely new idea.&quot;   Mr. Lockhart at  this point  came  to the conclusion that  intervention was so urgent that we ought to act at once, whether we  obtained the invitation  from the Bolsheviks or  not, and on the 13th June it was practically decided to warn the Soviet Government that, in  view of the continued German  advance  in Russia and the growth. of German influence  there, and particularly in view of  hostile  instructions which they had given in regard to our action at Murmansk, that we should regard ourselves free to take  any steps that seemed to us desirable to prevent the further  establishment of German influence in any part of Eussia.     On the 3rd June the question  of  intervention was formally considered by the Supreme  War Council in  Versailles, when it was decided that an  official enquiry should  be addressed  by His  Majesty&apos;s Government  and  the French and  Italian Governments to the Japanese  Government, whether the latter were prepared to take1 common action in Siberia with such help from the other co-belligerents as the military exigencies of the situation would allow; and that  the following conditions  should be
fulfilled, in order to make Allied intervention acceptable  both to  the  Russian people-and to public opinion in America and the Allied countries :  (a) the Allies to declare that they would take no side in Russian internal politics and  to promise to respect theterritorial integrity of Russia ; (6) the Allied  expedition to advance  as far west aspossible, its avowed object being to meet German influences  and defeat them, and to compel the Central Powers to reverse their policy of sending all  their forces to theWestern front.   On receipt of  a favourable reply from the Japanese Government, theviews of the Allies were to be  submitted to the United States Government in the hopeof receiving their assent and co-operation, since the whole policy must evidently proveabortive unless that were obtained.  j    The Japanese  Government  replied on  the  24th  June  that they could give no decision until a complete understanding had been reached between the three western powers and the United States ; that in any case they could  not engage to  extend the sphere of their military activities beyond the.limits of Eastern Siberia in view of the grave difficulties with which such operations would be practically confronted; and that,in the event of  common action being taken, they attached great importance to unity of command which they trusted would be placed in the hands of Japan.    During this time American public opinion had  to a certain degree swung round to the idea of intervention, but intervention of rather a vague and general kind; andthe proposal that held the field and at all appealed to the President was the despatch to  Siberia  of  a relief commission  supported  by a protective armed guard,  but an armed guard consisting mainly of American troops, and merely supplemented by theJapanese and a small number of  the other Allies.    At this point, however, the Siberian situation entered into a new phase owing tothe action Of the Czecho-Slovak troops in fighting their way from european russia across Siberia [see (0)].  Some  of these  troops had  reached Vladivostock by july, but the  larger number were  scattered along  the  railway, and  were in  grave danger of being cut off and overwhelmed by the armed German and Austro-Hungarianprisoners, who  were concentrating at Irkutsk  and constituting a  formidable menace.An appeal for  immediate military assistance  had already  been made by the CzechNational Council to the Allied consuls at Vladivostock.     The Supreme War  Council met at Versailles on the 2nd July and presented afurther  appeal  to  President  Wilson,  based  on the urgent necessity of affordingassistance to these Czech forces.   The President thereupon proposed to the JapaneseGovernment that each of the two Governments should despatch about 7,000 men to- Vladivostock to replace the Czechs moving westward to the rescue of  their comrades.The Japanese Government formally accepted the proposal on the  20th July, but theydeclined to bind themselves to send  exactly the same number of troops as  the UnitedStates Government to  Vladivostock, and wished to be  free to dispose of bodies of.troops at various stations along the Siberian railway west of the Manchurian  frontier to keep open  communications for the Czechs.   They determined to send a division to vladivostock and another division a little later on to guard the railway.     On the  3rd August  His  Majesty&apos;s Government, in   concert with  their Allies, decided to extend  military help to  the Czecho- Slovaks in  Siberia.     On the 5th August the United States  Government  issued a public statement to the effect  that they had  decided on a limited intervention in  Siberia with the solepurpose of rendering  protection to  the Czecho-Slovaks  against  the  German and austrian prisoners and  &quot; to steady any efforts at self-government or self-defence in which  the Russians themselves may be ready to  accept assistance.&quot;  They further hoped &quot;to send to Siberia a  commission  of merchants,  agricultural  experts, labour advisers, Red  Cross  representatives,  and  agents  of  the  Young  Men&apos;s Christian Association accustomed to organising the best methods of spreading useful information and rendering  educational help of a modest kind, in order in some  systematic way to relieve the immediate economic necessities of the people  there in every way for  which opportunity may open.&quot;     Intervention was therefore a fait accompli at last.  The  Allied forces agreed uponwere :  America, 7,000  ; Great Britain, 3,500; Italy and France, 3,000 ; Japan, 12,500. Japan was to have the  supreme command of the total force of  25,000.  The United  States Government expressed themselves ready to  entertain the idea of subsequent reinforce- ments, if necessary.  Japan agreed to send 12,000 men to  Vladivostock, stating that she would consult the United  States Government with regard to moving them outside that town and disposing of extra bodies of troops at various places along that railway. She reserved, however, to herself the right  &quot; to take immediate action should a sudden grave emergency call for such a  course.&quot;
    In opposition to suggestions that the scale of intervention should be enlarged, thesUnited States Government has held steadily to its point of view that &quot; it should be leftto a later time and circumstances not yet developed to consider radical alteration of thewhole scale and character  of action  in Siberia.&quot;  The Japanese originally sent a forceup through Manchuria  to Chita, where it has  remained ever since; but neither theynor the Americans have ever made any attempt to  advance westwards, in spite of&apos;numerous requests from us that they should do so.                                  (ii.) British.    The political factor in bringing about Allied intervention  in  Siberia was over-overwhelmingly British, and it was emphasised by the appointment on  the 21st August,1918,  of Sir Charles Eliot as  British High  Commissioner, who proceeded  first to vladivostock  and subsequently to Omsk, where he  resided  practically continuously,.until he returned to this country prior to taking up his post as British Ambassador atTokyo.   During the first period of his residence at Omsk he was represented at vladivostock by Mr. Alston as  Deputy High Commissioner, then  by Mr. 0&apos;Reilly, and1later  by Mr.  Lampson.  Mr. Porter was  attached to  Sir  C. Eliotfs staff as  british commercial Commissioner.    But compared with America and Japan the military and material contribution ofGreat Britain was on a relatively small scale.  We took  part, however, at once in theactual arrival  of the Allied forces  : in fact  we were there first,  as the MiddlesexRegiment  (25th  Battalion),  under Colonel John  Ward,  M.P.,  landed  at vladivostock on the 3rd August, 1918.   They were  followed on the 27th Novemberby the l/9th Battalion of the Hampshire  Regiment.    The Canadian Government also sent a contingent of 4,000  men under GeneralElmsley to Vladivostock,  but  decided that they should not move further westward&apos;Canadian  opinion, however, appears to have been  against  the  expedition from thebeginning and in favour of withdrawal as soon as  possible, and after considerable.discussion the Canadian Government yielded to popular pressure on the 5th April,and all the troops were withdrawn from  Siberia during the course of that month.    General KnOX arrived  at  Vladivostock on  the 5th September  (1918), andproceeded to  Kolchak^ headquarters.  His  duties  have  been (a) to form liaison between the War Office and the High Command of  the Allied expeditionary.forces ;(6)  to report on the military operations ;  (c) to assist the Japanese High Command;(d) to undertake the organisation of the  Russian volunteer forces;  (e) to  distributeequipment and stores for the  Russian forces  which were furnished  by His majesty&apos;s government.   One of his  additional activities has been the organisation of a school on Russian Island, for training Russian officers, which by July last had turned out 650 young officers and 850 non-commissioned officers,  while at Tomsk  he  had 400 more officersunder training, and others at Irkutsk.    At  the same time General Janin was  sent by the Erench Government  to takecommand of the Czech  forces in Siberia and all French troops co-operating with them,.subject to the  Supreme Japanese Command,&apos; and arrived at Vladivostock in the middleof November.  A  mild  controversy ensued as to his exact relations with General Knox,but in the middle of January 1919 an agreement was  come to, in conjunction with theOmsk Government, defining the respective spheres  of activity of General Janin andGeneral Knox, and this was approved and  published in an order by Admiral Kolchakdated the 21st January, 1919,  which set  forth the  agreed terms briefly as follows :(a)  General Janin has assumed office as  Commander-in-Chief of the troops of countriesallied with Russia and operations  in Western  Siberia and Eastern  Russia;  (6) theRussian  Chief of  Staff, in directing  operations, is  to co-ordinate his  work withGeneral Janin&apos;s staff to secure unity of action;  fc) General Knox  enters upon his duties in connection with the supply of  material from, abroad for the army, and in the unification  of  Allied assistance in  the organisation and training of troops in  rear;.(d)  The Minister of War to co-ordinate his. work in the branches  mentioned under (c)with General Knox&apos;s staff.    General Otani, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, arrived in Vladivostock on the  18th August, 1918,  and, by agreement between the Allies, tookcommand of all Allied forces.                                              &apos;    In December 1918 his command was  extended  to comprise the whole  of  Siberiaeast of Lake Baikal.    The British forces  have been bound  by no restrictions as regards moving westward,and the Middlesex Regiment  under Colonel.  Ward took  a  distinguished part in.
                                       17, Kolchak&apos;s  first  offensive. , They sailed  for  England  from  Vladivostok  on  the 8th  September  of  this  year,  and  were  followed  by  the  Hampshires  on  the 1st November.     His Majesty&apos;s Government decided in December 1918 to supply Admiral Kolchak with material assistance.  Equipment, clothing, and general ordnance stores, and such guns as could be spared up to. 200, were furnished for the use of the Siberian armies. In August 1919, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government reversed their  previous  decision;, partly in view of Kolchak&apos;s critical position, partly on the grounds of economy and the impossibility of bearing on their shoulders all the Allied commitments &quot;in Russia, and determined on concentrating  entirely  on  Denikin.  Accordingly they diverted to  the latter the stores which had been prepared  for shipment to Siberia.     In so doing, however, His Majest3r&apos;s Government had no intention of disinteresting themselves in the Siberian situation, and it was decided that the office and functions of the British High Commissioner should remain unchanged I August 20, 1919].                     (iii.) The Inter-Allied Railway Agreement.     The control  of the railway communications in Siberia has  been so important a factor in the political and military developments  of the last two years and  so&apos; vital to the success of the Allied intervention that no survey of the situation would be complete without some account of it.  It has from the very first  been a controversial question, often acute and bitter,  and has  supplied  the  main  cause of friction  between  the Japanese and the Americans.  To this clay it remains  an open sore, and may be  the immediate cause of  the withdrawal of the  American  forces  from  Siberia-an  event which   will  necessarily leave  the  Japanese  in  exclusive  control,  with  possibly incalculable consequences to the future of  the country  and  Japans  relations with  the Allies.     The history of this question begins with the arrival of the American  troops at Vladivostock  in  August  1918.   On  the  21st  August a  conference  took place at Vladivostock  between the Allied military  representatives and  the Russian  railway officials (the British representative being Colonel Jack), when it was decided that the direction and management of the  Russian railways should be left in the hands of the Russian officials.   But three days before the conference the American Commander- in-chief had notified  his Allied colleagues  that he was  recommending to his  Govern- ment that American engineers should be formally placed at  the disposal  of the Allied commanders to supervise the military use of the railways necessary for joint operations, owing  to the hopeless inefficiency of the existing Russian railway administrations. The concrete proposal subsequently made  by the United States Government was that Mr. J. F. Stevens, chairman of  the Railway Advisory Commission  to  Russia, should undertake the necessary operations of the different parts of the  Trans-Siberian Railway and its branches, with the assistance of American engineers in the service of Russia, known as the Russian railway corps, in conjunction  with  the Russian  railway officials and personnel in co-operation  with the Allies.  All  rights held  by anyone in the  line  were  to  be  expressly  reserved.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government, unaware apparently of  the decisions of the  Vladivostock Conference  of  the  21st  August or dissatisfied with  them,  at  once   declared that  they had  no  objection  to  the American proposal,  provided  the co-operation  of the Japanese  could  be secured; but  we  subsequently  adopted  an amendment  made by Sir  C. Eliot  that   the Japanese  might  be  allowed to control the railways  of the  Ussuri and  the Amur to the  same  extent  which it  was proposed  that the  Americans should control  the main line.  The Japanese Government replied (26th  September)  that, while they were perfectly willing  to  recognise  that these proposals were actuated solely  by considerations of military necessity,  these considerations did not  seem to them tojustify a measure which  would  necessitate the displacement  of  Russian  officials. General Horvat had been duly appointed as Director of the  Chinese  Eastern  Rail- way, his appointment was duly confirmed  by the last  Government  of  Russia and in that capacity he was  also left in charge of the  Ussuri  Railway, the administration of which under  Russian law had been  entrusted  to the  Chinese Eastern  Railway.  it seemed to the Japanese Government that  the  removal of General Horvat and  his officials would constitute an intervention  in the domestic affairs of Russia wdtich it had always been the  declared policy of the Allied Governments to avoid.  ,     As regards the  military  necessity of the  United States proposals, the Japanese Government  saw no reason to; modify  the  decision of the Vladivostock Conferenceand  were consequently, opposed to the proposal put  forward by  the  United StatesGovernment.
     His Majesty&apos;s Government thereupon at once informed the Japanese and United States Government that the only desire oi His Majesty&apos;s Government was the effective working of the railways, and  that they were quite  ready  to  adopt  any arrangement which was agreed upon  by the United States and Japanese Governments which would secure this result.     A scheme was then devised [October  31]  by the United States Ambassador  at Tokyo and Mr. Stevens, as follows :       (i.) The general supervision to be regulated and controlled by a special Inter-         ,  Allied  Committee consisting of representatives of each  Power, including           Russia, having military forces in Siberia, the chairman  to be  a Russian,           the Committee to  exercise supervision through                 (a.)  A  central  office to be established for operations of all railways                      in the zone.                (6.)  An Allied military bureau to be created for co-ordinating military                      transportation under direction of proper military authorities.     (ii.) The protection of the railways to be placed under the Allied  military forces           and the technical administrative and economic management of all railways           in the zone to be entrusted to Mr. Stevens, who  should be appointed by the           senior military officers of  the Allied forces in  the several districts occupied           by them.   Mr. Stevens to be given title of Director-General.     (iii.) At the head of each railway  should remain a Russian manager or director           with powers conferred by existing Russian law.  The mutual relations of           the chairman of the Inter-Allied Committee and the Director-General with           the managers of  the railways to  be  regulated according to the existing           laws and rules for the operation of Russian railways.     The Japanese Government  at once objected [November  10] that this  Americanscheme involved American  administration of the  Chinese  Eastern Railway,  whichJapanese public opinion would  never  admit; and they submitted  counter-proposals,involving a  joint General Directorate  of Mr. Stevens and a Japanese representative,which the United States Government  in their turn rejected.  Thereupon the JapaneseGeneral Staff submitted a project of  their own, the effect of which was to confine theDirector-GeneraTs  jurisdiction to advice  and assistance, and  conferred  no power to compel Russian managements to follow that advice.   Mr. Stevens at  once pronouncedthe scheme unworkable.     In  the  end [February  1919] the  Japanese and United  states government came to  an agreement, which was accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,  the French, Italian, and Chinese Governments, and Admiral Kolchak, all of whom proceeded forthwith  to appoint representatives to the various boards to be setup under it.     The  agreement provided  for an Inter-Allied  Railway  Board with  a technical Board and  a Military Transport Board subordinate to it. Mr. Stevens becamepresident of the Technical Board, while  General Jack became the British representative on it.     Between February  and June all went smoothly.  Several meetings of the Inter-Allied Railway Board and of the  other boards were held, and measures were approvedwhich, led to considerable improvement in the traffic between Omsk and Vladivostock,as many as six trains a day going forward in June as against one in February.  1   According to the decisions of the Board, the  Allied troops were  distributed along the railway in four separate sections.  The Japanese obtained one section, the Americansanother, the Chinese  another (including the  whole of the Chinese Eastern  Railway),and the Russians a fourth (extending  west as far as Baikal City).  The guarding of therailway west of Baikal City was left largely  in the hands of the Czecho-Slovaks.  Thequestion  was  also raised at the time whether the-authority of the Board should extendwest of the Ural mountains as well as east.  This would have involved the control ofthe section being British, and to this there were objections  from our point of view,inasmuch as we should have been bound to afford material assistance and it would havebeen impossible  for us to continue to  supply personnel for  reorganisation beyond theUrals on the  same scale as we had  supplied it on the eastern side.  So the questionnever went any &quot;further.     The successful  execution of the scheme clearly depended largely  on adequatefinancial  arrangements being made, and the Inter-Alhed Railway Board recommended
the creation of a fund for its work.  His Majesty&apos;s Government  agreed to participateon  condition  that  the  expenditure borne  by  them  should be  utilised  solely for purchases in  Great  Britain  and Canada,  but the United  States Government thenrequested His Majesty&apos;s Government to participate to the extent of 5,000,000 dollarsin providing  a  fund of 20,000,000 dollars, on  which the Board  could draw at  itsdiscretion.  This further  liability His Majesty&apos;s Government felt unable  to  accept,in view of the fact that  Great Britain had done  more than  any other Power in thematter of assisting Admiral Kolchak, to say nothing of  their Russian commitmentselsewhere, and  that the numerous military  staff under  General Jack were already being paid at the rate of nearly 9,0001. a month.    In  June, things began to go  wrong.  The Japanese  and Americans fell outout as to the extent to which their respective troops should be used for the purpose ofguarding the Siberian railways.   The root of the trouble lay in the differences  whichhad arisen as regards  the jurisdiction  of the, Inter-Allied Commander-in-Chief east of Lake Baikal.  The Japanese Government claimed that  General Otani, the JapaneseCommander-in-Chief, should be  in  control,  and the claim  was  recognised  by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the  French Government, but General Graves,  commanding the American  troops, declined to agree, maintaining that he alone could be responsible to the United  States  Government for the disposition and activities  of his own troops.The Japanese now contended that the sphere of activity of the Allied troops in Siberiashould not be limited, and that they should be at liberty to deal with Bolshevik forceswherever they were situated.  General Graves, on  the  other hand, maintained thatthe activities of  his forces must be strictly limited to the railway zone, and that he wasnot empowered  to  use  his  forces anywhere outside that zone.   This point, however,shortly afterwards solved  itself, as  the Americans were attacked by Bolshevik  bands,and lost a considerable  number of killed and wounded.  Thereupon, they took actionthemselves against the Bolsheviks in the Ussuri region, and a United States cruiserparticipated in the action.    The next complication that arose was due to the support  given to Semenoff by theJapanese.  This unruly individual  took to putting every conceivable obstacle in theway of  the traffic of the  Siberian railways, commandeering wagons  anrl locomotives,and at  times  completely  obstructing  the  communications  between  Omsk  andVladivostock.   The root of the trouble lay no doubt  ir. the  dispute between Kolchakand Semenoff, but the  Japanese  have practically taken no steps to restrain the latter,;in spite of remonstrances from their allies, though they could quite easily have done so.    Next, the Japanese began to  show designs on the Chinese Eastern Railway which,as mentioned above, had been consigned to the Chinese.  The immediate excuse was astrike of the railway employees on that line on July 31 over a question  of the currency in which their wages should be paid.  We  at once urged the Chinese  Government totake steps to deal with the situation, and simultaneously the wages question was settled and the strike came  to an end.  But the Japanese would  not  let  it rest there.  their representative on the  Inter-Allied  Technical Board  announced  that  the Japanesemilitary authorities intended to begin relieving their troops at Chita on the 15th August,and that unless  railway traffic was resumed by that date the  Japanese would open theline themselves.  This  at  once aroused  the suspicions  of the Allied representatives,who assumed that  the Japanese intended to gain control  of  the  Chinese  Eastern,Railway, and His Majesty&apos;s representative at Tokyo endeavoured  to  persuade theJapanese Government not to move their troops until ordinary traffic had been resumed,or to carry out the relief by way of the Amur Railway.  In the meantime the Japaneserepresentative on the Inter-Allied Technical Board proposed that the  protection of theChinese Eastern Railway should  be taken over by  the  Japanese Command, but theBoard refrained from expressing any opinion on the proposal.           :            ;&apos;i     Simultaneously, reports came through from our representatives that the japanese were  once again&apos; taking no steps in spite of all the assurances that  had  been given at Omsk and Tokyo to restrain Semenoff from raiding the railway, and,  in fact, the,Japanese Commander-in-Chief quite frankly told;  the Railway Board that his troops could not interfere between Russian authorities.   So critical: did the position becomeat the end ,of August that Mr. Morris (the American at Tokyo, at that time on a, visit to Siberia)  threatened to withdraw all  the American railway officers from the Trans-,Baikal section, which would probably have meant the suspension of all  traffic.     Incidentally, suggestions were being made at this  time in military quarters as  tothe desirability  of getting Japanese troops up to Kolchak&apos;s front, or at least to replace the restive  Czechs  on their  section of  the railway, the inducement being temporarycontrol of the Chinese Eastern Railway.  But His Majesty&apos;s representatives in the Far       [1625]                                     &apos;                       E
East unanimously expressed their vigorous opposition to  any such action, and so the suggestions were rejected.    The dispute between the Americans and Japanese now came to a head.   On the2nd September the United States G-overnment addressed a  note to the Governmentsof Japan, Great Britain,  France,  Italy,  China,  and  to  the Russian Ambassador in washington, drawing attention to the Japanese behaviour.  The main points dealt within the note were (a) the Japanese claim to limit the duties of their troops to the mere  &quot;guarding of their section of  the line on the ground that they were under no obligationto co-operate in  furthering the general plan for maintaining railway communications ;(6) the Japanese contention that  disagreements between Russians under the control ofthe  Omsk  Government  and  a  national  of a  country   engaged  in the  operationor protection  of the railway, must be a matter for discussion  between the  OmskGovernment  and  the  Government of the person concerned;  (e)  the  refusal of theJapanese military  commanders  to protect  the  lives  of   the Allied  instructors inthe territory  under the  control  of  Semenoff;  (d)  the  refusal of  the  JapaneseCommander-in-Chief to give the support of  his forces in making effective the  declaredpurposes  of  the  agreement.  Having  recited the  misdeeds of the Japanese, theAmerican note proceeds to threaten the withdrawal of all American troops in Siberia,unless some radical action was taken to alter the situation.    The Japanese  Government  replied to the American note on the 19th november and dealt with the charges in detail.    They explained their position as  regards  the protection of the  railway,  and maintained that,  while it was their  duty to guard  and keep open the line and toprotect  it against  attack,  they were doing all they could to maintain the operation ofthe railway plan.   On  the other  hand, they repudiated any  suggestion  that the allied military forces should  be made subordinate to the Inter-Allied Railway Board or tothe Technical Board acting under it.  They denied the charge that their troops didnot protect the lives of Allied instructors in the territory controlled  by Semenoff, butat the same time they pointed out that in the Japanese instructions  it was laid down that it was only when trains were obstructed by the lawless elements of the populationthat armed force  should  be used,  while  any dispute involving Russian militaryauthorities should  be  looked upon as an  internal political trouble, and should bereferred to the higher  Russian authorities.    Here the  matter stands for the present, and the Americans have still to considerwhether they will  carry  out their threat of withdrawal,  to which  significantly no reference was made in the  Japanese note.   We  on our side have been urging the americans to take no step in this  direction  which would play directly into the handsof the Japanese by leaving them in sole control.    Considerable space has been devoted to this subject  of  the railways, because  it isround them that the much-predicted quarrel between the Americans and Japanese hasbeen  simmering  ever  since  they  both appeared on  Siberian1  soil, and  has at timesbroken  out into an  open row. The Americans have, on the whole, had right on their side, and, had they been free to employ  Mr. Stevens and his technical staff  from thefirst,  the railway  administration  might have been placed  on an efficient  basis sixmonths before it actually was.  That might even have  altered the  general course ofevents,   military  and  political.    The  Japanese  are  entirely responsible for  theobstruction that has occurred, and have played a political game throughout.   We have still to see what the next move is going to be.                                  (iv.)  Economic.     During the period from May to August 1918, when,  owing to the attitude of theUnited  States Government, a complete deadlock had occurred  as regards the prospects of Inter-Allied military intervention in Siberia, the idea  grew up that, if we could notintervene with armies, we could at least promote  a scheme (for political purposes), towhich  no  one could  object, for despatching supplies for  the relief of. the Siberianpopulation.   The United States Government were of the same mind.   The  first stepthen  was  to  organise a  scheme on  an Inter-Allied basis, though, for geographicalconsiderations and owing to the need for economy in  tonnage, &amp;c, in the West, it was clear that the  main  burden must  fall on Japan  and the  United . States though a certain amount  of  British goods  at  Vladivostock and  Habarovsk could be made immediately available, while Canada and other  parts of  the British Empire couldsupply  later on.  &quot;  This scheme  of economic relief  was quickly  elaborated for  administration underthe Allied  Governments.   The  two principles underlying  the [supply of  goods to
Siberian  consumers were  laid  down  as  follows :   First,  that  the whole transactionshould be as far  as  possible self-supporting and  not  eleemosynary (since  there was little evidence of real destitution), and so  prevent abuses like the exploitation of  the consumers by Chinese and other middlemen ; and  that the element  of profit-makingshould be excluded from the supply and distribution sent  for purposes of relief, so asto make it clear that the object was to benefit the  local population and  to avoid anysuspicion that the Allies were aiming at the exploitation of the economic necessities ofSiberia for private gain.  At the same time  ifwas  highly desirable that all the AlliedGovernments taking part in the scheme should pursue the same policy in  regard tothe terms on which the goods should be disposed of to Siberian consumers.    To give effect to this, as  the  British  contribution, it was arranged that a businessorganisation should be set up at Vladivostock, under  the supervision and control ofthe Board of  Trade, and  under them the Commercial Commissioner in Siberia, to actas the agent of His Majesty&apos;s  Government for the supply of  goods.  The task of setting up and working this  organisation was  entrusted to Mr. Leslie  Urquhart, andthe organisation itself was christened the  Siberian Supply Company.   It was forbidden to trade on private account, and was to be remunerated by reimbursement of in- or out-of-pocket expenses, and ^ per  cent, on  the turnover.  Mr. Urquhart&apos;s functions wereto acquire and sell goods and stock at Vladivostock or elsewhere in Siberia ; to procureorders for goods to be supplied from the United Kingdom ;  to import such supplies as were  available in Canada and the rest  of  the Empire;  and obtain and export goodsavailable in  Siberia in exchange for goods to be sold there.    A notice was issued to British firms by the Board of Trade at the end of September(1918) publishing the formation of the Siberian Supply Company, and announcing theestablishment of an  agency which was ready  to  entertain applications from  british firms  who  had established  Siberian  trade, subject of course  to  tonnage possibilitiesand export restrictions.  The first shipment of goods (to the  value  of  20,000L) tookplace  on  the 28th September    Ever since the inception of the scheme the United States  Government had beenasked  to co-operate with  us, but it was  not until the end of November that they tookany definite action towards  the  economic relief  of Siberia.   Their method  was toorganise  a corporation under the name of the &quot; War Trade Board of the United StatesRussian  Bureau Incorporated&quot; with  a capital of 5,000,000 dollars, and Mr.  VanceMacCormick as the president.  Its policy  was to secure that goods should be  sold atthe lowest possible price, and distributed in Russia so  as to reach  those in need ofthem.  Where private traders were unable or  unwilling to secure such  distribution,the War  Trade Board were prepared at once to take the necessary steps.    The Japanese also attempted to sell  goods  in the  Amur  province through anofficial organisation, but it proved a failure and the  local  Japanese merchants  causedtheir Government to  suspend the sales.   But this was not before  the latter had usedtheir agent to secure  valuable concessions and rights of all kinds.    Nor were the British firms in  Siberia any more pleased than the  Japanese withthe establishment of  an  official agency,  and in December steps had to be taken topacify them by a  local announcement by  the High  Commissioner that every endeavourwas being made at home to facilitate private trade  and that manufacturers were being encouraged  to use their own agents and correspondents in preference to the Govern-nient   agency,  whenever  the former  were  willing to  act.   But it was clear, fromSir C. Eliot&apos;s reports three months after the agency had been formed, that the  sche  ewas at least a partial failure,  and had never apparently been heard of west of Harbin.    Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s  Government  thought it  would  be  impracticable to close  down  the agency at once, and  determined to carry it on until conditions were more  normal, and private enterprises had been successfully  established to meet localneeds.    Before  long  the  agency was going  begging.   First there was an  idea that theCanadian Government wTould like to have it for the purpose of distributing Canadiangoods.  Then came the turn  of the United  States  Government, and Mr. Hubbard, the managing Director of the Siberian Supply Company, proceeded to Washington to  talkthe matter over with the  War Trade  Board. All to no avail.    The Siberian Supply Company is now in process of liquidation as an agency ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and arrangements  are  being made to terminate as soon aspossible the Board of  Trade&apos;s agreement with Mr. Leslie Urquhart of the 18th September.    In spite of the criticisms that have been levelled at it  and its  rather ingloriousend,  the company&apos;s  services must not be  underrated.   It  has been instrumental in purchasing  and despatching to Vladivostock  during  the  course of  the present year       [1625];                                                        E 2
goods (chiefly textiles) to the. value  of  approximately 280,0001., and by an  agreement concluded last July between the company and the Union of Siberian Creamery Associa-tion 200,000L worth of these goods,  sold to the Union, will be distributed by the latteramongst the population.                  /                   IV.                  (E.)-THE AIMS  OF JAPAN IN SIBERIA.    The designs of Japan on the Far Eastern continent have long been the subject ofdiscussion:  but we are no nearer finding out the real Japanese objective.    We have latterly conceded to Japan the German Pacific Islands, but  although  shethereby acquired considerable war  gains at a relatively low price, they have broughther up against  the barrier  of the  Equator, which obstructs irrevocably her advancesouth and confines her once more  within a definite space.   The concession, therefore,cuts both ways; and, if we  have made an unpleasant virtue of necessity,  Japan has,as far as her southward Pacific penetration is concerned, come up against an  almostequally unpleasant condition of  finality.  Accordingly she  has now only  two possiblefields of expansion left: either the Philippines and the Dutch Islands or the Far Easterncontinent.    Japan is the country par excellence where Realpolitik is the only consideration inforeign policy.   She owes her present position in the world  entirely to this  country for having kept the ring during the Russo-Japanese war.   We slighted her, it is true, inAugust 1914, but  the balance still  remained  in our favour.  Yet she failed us, and above all she failed Russia, when, at a grave moment in the latter&apos;s history, she  deniedhelp.  She courted the Germans secretly during  1916.  The Japanese  General Staffthought they were going to win;  a section of Japanese opinion hoped they would.    In the  middle of all this, July 1916, she  all of  a  sudden signed a treaty withRussia, which perhaps was  primarily a reinsurance treaty against a German  revanchein the event of a  German victory.  Incidentally she obtained from Russia  sixty miles of Manchurian  railway.  But, if the ultimate effect of  the  treaty was  obscure,  onepractical  result was bound to  ensue, namely, that  Russia would   proportionatelydisinterest herself in the Far East as the main objective of her policy.   The  Russo-Japanese Treaty, read in connection with the  Constantinople Agreement,  could  hardlyindicate other than the swing of the Russian political pendulum from  east to west.This  would amount  to  a further consolidation  of  the Japanese  position on the far eastern  continent, and, unless  Russia subsequently acquired  fresh strength  andredirected her activities into their former channels, the equilibrium was to  that  extentmodified in Japan&apos;s favour.    This, of course,  is now back history, but it  is of interest as showing that alreadythree years ago Japan had embarked on a Russian policy of  her own.   Her plans were evidently already laid  when a year  later the Bolshevik revolution broke out in Russia.Viscount Motono at once declared that he could not remain  indifferent to an outbreakof disorder in Siberia.    But we straightway pursued towards her a policy almost  equivalent in effect tothat of August and September 1914.   In those  days, having asked for her assistance,we hesitated over the limits within which  we should  allow her to give  it.  Japaneseaction should  not, we insisted, extend  to the  Pacific. Ocean  beyond  the China Seas,beyond Asiatic waters westward of  the China Seas, nor to any foreign territory  exceptthat in German occupation on the Asiatic continent.  Our  procedure  was dictated, nodoubt, by Imperial considerations, on  the assumption  that the war would  not assumesuch  proportions as to absorb all British energy into the west, and  lead to an indefinitecondition of impotence in the Far East.   Yet little more  than a year later we werebegging  her to send her troops to Russia and her ships to  the Indian Ocean and theMediterranean.     A month after the outbreak of  the Bolshevik revolution the Japanese government informed us that they were very anxious about the situation  at Vladivostock, that theBolsheviks were, gaining in power there, and that Japan had  great  interests in  that part of the world.   They were told at once that if it became necessary to land  a force for their protection,  it was very desirable to avoid, as far as possible, any appearance of invasion, and that only a very small  force should be landed, if possible, in concert with the Americans.  Two months  later we  decided  to invite Japan to  act  as themandatory of the  Powers in Siberia,  and four months after that we were urging thedespatch  of a  large Japanese army as far  as  Cheliabinsk, and, if  possible,  beyondthe Urals into European Russia  [see D (i) ].
      Small wonder, then, perhaps that the Japanese, feeling themselves required to act ia full unison with the Western Powers only when it suited the batters&apos; interests, felt free to confine themselves wholly to their own.   No  doubt it was inexpedient that the Japanese should take solitary action in Siberia, but the reminder by us that this was our view was bound to create the same slight and breed  the same suspicion as three years before.      But there  are  equally  many  reasons for believing  that our  apprehensions in the matter were  justified.   The Japanese accompanied  their entry into Siberia with the usual proclamation of disinterestedness. The proclamation affirmed  the constant desire of Japan  to promote relations of enduring friendship  with Russia  and the Russian  people,  and  reaffirmed her  avowed  policy of respecting  the territorial integrity of Russia and of  abstaining from all interference in her  internal politics. It further declared that upon  the  realisation of the objects indicated,  the  Japanese troops would  immediately  withdraw  from  Russian  territory, and  leave wholly unimpaired the sovereignty of Russia in all its . phases, whether  military or  political. Nevertheless  a  self-seeking and obstructive attitude on the part of the  Japanese became evident  at once.   Their  first  action on  arrival  in  Vladivostock and  in Khabarovsk was  to  occupy  high-handedly a huge number of  public  and private buildings  at  enormous  cost  without any reference  to the  Russian authorities and regardless of the fact  that they would be required  by the Russian units when  they proceeded to start  forward.   The  Amur steamers  they seized as  prizes of  war. Their progress through the country was marked by utter  contempt of the population, and  they  proceeded  to occupy pacified territory in the  rear with a force five times stronger than was required, while doing  nothing to  help the  half-armed and half- clothed Russians  and Czechs to fight.   The immediate impression created  was that they were endeavouring by every means in their power to prevent the establishment of a strong  Central  Government with a single army, and their behaviour was  generally described as that  of a people who intend to annex what they have occupied.   It must not, however,  be forgotten that military occupation even in a friendly area is  inclined to be uncompromising, and even General Poole treated Archangel and the surrounding territories as a conquered country.     Side by side with this, a strong  anti-Ally spirit  was prevalent.  The  mot tfordre through the  army was reported even  to be  actively pro-German, and there were individual instances of officers stating  openly that Japan had no intention of fighting against Germany,  that the Japanese did not consider the Germans as  enemies, and were under no circumstances  going beyond Irkutsk, and that in the very  near future Japan and Germany would be one.     But it was in their dealings with Kolchak  and his Government th   their lack of harmony with their Allies was to prove most inconvenient, and  to arouse the greatest suspicion of their  motives.     Semenoff had in the days before  intervention  been a sufficiently active anti- Bolshevik  element to attract assistance from both Great  Britain, France, and Japan. There was no  Government and  no  organisation  in Siberia with interests to  consider, and the employment of irregular forces was unobjectionable  from a  wider standpoint. When, however, Kolchak assumed the reins of Government, the need for unity behind the lines and for the co-operation of the Allies in helping Kolchak to establish  it clearly outweighed every other consideration.    Yet the  Japanese  deliberately obstructed. Over and over again we have asked them to come into line and not to support the free lances, Semenoff, Kalmikoff, Horvat, and their like, who were  doing nothing but  meke Kolchak&apos;s  task of reorganisation almost impossible, especially by perpetually raiding the Siberian railways and otherwise endangering his  lines  of communications.  What other  object could  they have but  the  pursuit of  an  individual interest to  the detriment of an orderly Government in  Siberia, or possibly with  that very purpose in mind ?     On the 13th  June  of this year China tore  up  her treaties with Russia,  and General Hsu  Shu-cheng  advanced with  a Japanese-equipped force,  financed,  it is believed, out of a Japanese  loan, into Outer Mongolia with the ostensible object of reasserting Chinese authority.   At the  same time there was a remarkable increase in the numbers of Japanese at Kalgan and Urga.   Simultaneously Semenoff produced a scheme for Mongolian independence.   The incident  in  itself may  be of subsidiary importance.  But  a  few months before Semenoff had been  dismissed by  Admiral Kolchak, who  had despatched troops to Chita, where he was at the time, to  see that the order was carried out.  It was Japanese support alone  that.saved him,  and he wasmade to feel that he owed his position to Japan.
     This  is an illustration of what the Japanese have  done, and it could  be easily-multiplied.   Nor  have they  during this  Semenoff period  been inactive  in other directions.  Kolchak himself reported early this year that they were carrying on an -influential propaganda  among the reactionary elements at his headquarters, promisingan effective campaign against the Bolsheviks in European Russia and a restoration oftraffic in return for mining rights in Eastern Siberia;  while at the same time  thatthey supplied Kolchak with  rifles they withheld the ammunition, without  which ofcourse they were useless.     The signature of the  armistice between the Allies  and the Germans came as anundoubted shock to the Japanese military  party, who had  counted first on a Germanvictory and  then  on a stalemate.   Possibly  it modified,  if it did not reverse, theorientation in their Siberian policy.   At least  their behaviour towards their BritishAllies changed from arrogance to courtesy.   Gradually they showed signs of rallyingto  Kolchak&apos;s Government,  and  actually  in  May  of  this  year they proposed itsrecognition by the Allies.   During ,this time, however, they acquired sole control ofthe  railway from  Changchung to Harbin, of  the  whole of  the Amur railway fromKhabarovsk, and of a portion of the Ussuri Railway ; and though Article 5 of the RailwayAgreement provides that the scheme  by which they  acquire this control &quot; shall cease to be operative upon the withdrawal of foreign military forces  from Siberia, and allthe foreign railway experts appointed under this arrangement shall then  be recalledforthwith,&quot; yet who shall say  that excuses will not be found for delaying evacuation ?In  effect  the Japanese have  acquired  entire control of the  railway from Korea toHarbin, as also of the Ussuri and Amur branches of the Siberian Railway, which theyhave not hitherto enjoyed.  At least it was  made worth  their while to throw in theirlot  wholeheartedly  with their Allies.  This  did  not,  however, prevent  them from making simple and direct  proposals to Kolchak himself for the cession of the northernhalf of Sakhalien  and  part  of  Kamchatka in return for the despatch of an army to western Siberia proposals which were clearly not accepted.   But they did  not forthatbse touch with Semenoff, Kalmikoff and the other Atamans, to whom they continuedto supply  arms and ammunition, and when,  after a temporary disorder at Vladivostock,Rozanoif, another Ataman, gained the  upper hand, they hailed his success as a Japanesetriumph.  In general, their argument in meeting remonstrances seems to be  that theAllies  have no exclusive obligations  to  Kolchak so long as his Government remainsunrecognised, and  that the Atamans are Russian commanders  nominally  acting as  his subordinates, and have in  any case the same legal position of  possessing only de factoauthority as the Admiral himself.     With the failure of Kolchak&apos;s offensive and his retreat to  Irkutsk, the control ofhis  Government  has  sensibly weakened,  if  it is  not  to collapse  altogether.   Theimmediate result has been a marked increase in the  power of  the Atamans.  Semenoffhas evidently thought the  moment propitious to assert his power,  lie  has  possessedhimself of a quantity of rifles intended  for another  destination,  and stopped aconsignment of the Omsk  gold in transit eastAvard.   He will possibly soon be the  onlysolid anti-Bolshevist force in the country.   If 10, the Japanese will have played theircards well; they are already, indeed, reaping the fruits of their diplomacy.  A Japanesesyndicate  has just  been formed with a capital of 23,000,000 yen, of which the JapaneseGovernment will provide 20,000,000,  with  the  object, it is  alleged, of acquiring fromSemenoff all the forests and mines in  the region between the&apos; River Argun and LakeBaikal.  At the same time Semenoff  is raising an  Asiatic division, numbering 4,000,composed of  Mongolians and Chinese, and  the  Japanese, who  are unable to increasethe number of their own troops in Trans-Baikalia, are to provide him with sufficientequipment to enable him to raise his forces to  18,000.  Besides this, his  influence is steadily growing with  the Cossacks and the reactionary elements, and it is suggestedthat he is aiming at complete independence, counting on Japanese support.     Finally, there are  numerous reports that Rozanoff, with the support of Semenoff,has a  project on  foot for the  formation  of  a Far Eastern  State,  and,  though theJapanese  have denied it, there is evidence that they are  actively behind the project.     What are we  to deduce out of all this tangle of  intrigue and back-door diplomacy ?The immediate purpose of it is certainly obscure. It has beenfrequently suggested  from our authorities on the  spot that  the whole  aim and  object of  the Japanese is  to  keepSiberia in a state of unrest, and so manufacture a possible excuse for  their continuedoccupation of North Manchuria where 95 per cent, of their  troops have  remainThey admittedly want the eventual control of  the  Chinese Eastern Railway and thereversion of the Russian rights in Manchuria and Mongolia.  But is this all ?     It is  clear that, in spite of periodical fluctuations, at heart they have throughoutdesired the collapse  of the Kolchak  Government as  serving their ends in some  form
or other.  When that came in prospect in August last, they declared that the situationin Siberia was fast approaching a crisis for the Japanese  Empire;  that if the Govern-ment had to withdraw into the zone guarded  by Japanese troops the latter would be compelled to  fight the  Bolshevik armies;  and that,  if the British. Americans, andCzechs were to withdraw, Japan would have to think out a definite policy independent of the Allies to be ready to meet future developments.     The Americans are convinced that under Japanese instigation Semenoff, Kalmikoff,and Rozanoff are working with the  German-Russians of  the old  regime towards thecreation of an independent State comprising Siberia  and  Mongolia, and  that this will lead to an eventual alliance between Japan, Russia, and Germany.     The  first  of these   conclusions  is  possibly not unjustified,  but  it  would notnecessarily mean annexation.  That is not the Japanese way certainly not in the firstinstance ; and it is believed that for climatic reasons  the Japanese could never live in siberia.  There are two opinions as to the  general policy of Japan in  the Far East.The first is that Japan, in the capacity of a Far Eastern Prussia, has long&apos; been aiming at the military domination of  China  and a Pan-Asiatic programme fraught with evilconsequences to India.  There is much to support this  view, for the famous demandsof May  1915, which we  successfully  blocked at  the  expense of our own  popularity,would have involved a  virtual Japanese military dictatorship  over China.  But themanifestations of a political programme, evidently with this end in view, have been dueat great measure to the  ebb  and flow of the conflict between the military  party in japan and the more balanced  and enlightened elements.  The other opinion is that thereal Japanese programme is substantially commercial.  Japan, according to this theory,aims at herself developing the natural resources  and so ultimately controlling the rawmaterial of the Far East.; at securing China in particular as a retail market for hermanufactured goods to  the greatest  extent possible;  and  at ensuring that on theFar Eastern continent there shall grow up strong Japanese bulwarks against the West,and not  as   a menace  to  herself.  In  this  case  the  integrity  of China  and themaintenance, Avithin certain limitations, of the independent sovereignty of States on theFar Eastern  continent becomes a cardinal  point of Japanese policy, and partition andannexation will not  figure in the programme.   In theory  and on  paper the western powers and America will have nothing to complain of  in the gradual development ofthis programme, and it will be nominally their own fault if they fail in the competition.But, in practice, if the precedent of Manchuria is followed, we may look forward to oneencroachment after another on the policy of the open door or, in better phraseology,equal opportunities will gradually  disappear, and,  as far  as  we are  concerned,  thepredominance of British trade will proportionately decline.     The prospect of a German-Russian-Japanese alliance  has become a familiar bogey :but,.for the  present, it may merely be a  natural  but  unfounded  apprehension.Nevertheless, we are  confronted with a situation in which two predatory Powers at theextreme ends  of Russia are  credited with designs on her integrity : and the presenceof numerous Japanese agents in Esthonia  and Latvia might easily be interpreted as asubterranean   conspiracy between  the  two.    Every  other Power is  avowedly andadmittedly disinterested.  But every Japanese is born and bred  with ideas of aggressivepatriotism, of his superiority to foreigners, of his national call to head a revival of the neighbouring brown and yellow races.  His success in the Russo-Japanese War madethese ideas a practical and living force in the national life.  His training, military and commercial,  is on German  lines, and his character appears  naturally to assimilate German methods of organisation and discipline.   Not only is he aggressively patriotic,but he is nationally aggressive, individually truculent, fundamentally deceitful, imbuedwith the idea that he  is under an  obligation  to impose  his  own particular form  ofKultur on his neighbours.  It is impossible to disregard the fact that Japan has not got equal opportunities in the world generally, for her people are virtually excludedfrom Australia,  Africa,  North and South  America,  and  even part  of  Asia.  The question is, are we going to draw a tight circle round her activities, or are we going  toallow her latitude for ostensibly legitimate operations outside  her appointed sphere ?It may be said that she must expand somewhere.  If so,  is there any grave objectionto her  expansion taking place in the wide, undeveloped  territories which lie  at her door Manchuria, Mongolia, Sakhalien, and Eastern Siberia ?  At any rate, we  have  at all costs to prevent such expansion from being effected in patent opposition, to  us, and not by a combination which would mean the most formidablefmenace we have yet hadto face.
