Malleson  telegraphs  11th  December,  repeatingTehran :-    &quot; Copy  of Tashkent paper News recently received  contains article on  Englishdesigns in Middle  East, and  says profiting by abstention  of Soviet Russia from  allschemes for  external aggression, England has seized Persia and now has  designs  onTurkistan.   It is  not with armed strength that English are making their  approacheson Turkistan, but with  remarkable diplomatic subtlety they are establishing for them-selves such a position in Bokhara and Khiva that one fine day the Avhole of Turkistanwill be in England&apos;s power.   We Bolsheviks must never forget the magnitude of Eng-land&apos;s Eastern interests, of Iioav abhorrent to her will be the existence of a Red Turkistan.We must set to work at once to counteract the influence the English have obtained in our midst, and so far from allowing Turkistan to fall into EngiancVs orbit Ave mustourselves use it as  a base from which Ave shall  compass the destruction of  Englishpower, not only in Persia but throughout all  the East.  The  slyly woven  diplomacyof England  in  Turkistaft must be  checkmated, and  that is our  first task,  as thisachieved we must proceed to the destruction of our most powerful and subtle  enemy,England.   With  the  downfall  of the  chief  representative  of  imperialism andcapitalism the triumph of Bolshevik ideals will soon be universal.&quot;
