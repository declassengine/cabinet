L^HURST.THE  CABINET.THE  MILITARY  ASPECT  OF  THE  TURKISH  PEACE                          SETTLEMENT.       MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.    I circulate for the information of my colleagues the following Memorandum on the W.0.0152                                                  -                             &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; k OTOmilitary aspects of the Turkish Peace  Settlement which  has  been prepared by the   b61bGeneral Staff.                                                WINSTON  S. CHURCHILL.  24/.A December,  1919.                               MEMORANDUM.    1. On the assumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government may shortly be occupied byactive negotiations with  a view to the termination of the Turkish Armistice and thesettlement of the peace terms with Turkey, the General Staff desire to call attention toGeneral Milne&apos;s despatch, dated the 20th October, of  which  copies were circulated bythe Secretary of State for War on the 18 th November, under the heading &quot; Cabinet  W.0.0152The Nationalist-Movement in Turkey.&quot;(CP-SfO                     &quot;             &quot;5241    2. The General Staff understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that inview of the part played by the British Empire in the war with Turkey, the execution ofthe terms of peace should be mainly a British concern;  they therefore wish to drawparticular attention  to paragraphs 4, 5, 13 and  14 of the above-mentioned despatch,which all bear upon the relation between the actual  terms and the force necessary tosecure their enforcement.    3. (i.)  It  seems  scarcely necessary  to  mention  that  the  situation has changedconsiderably since the commencement of the  Turkish Armistice on 31st October. 1918,both as regards the armed  resources  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government and the politicalsituation  within the  pre-war Turkish Empire.  The British military contribution now available  for enforcing the peace terms, otherwise than in Palestine and Mesopotamia, isas follows :          One  division plus army troops  (including  garrison  of Batum), comprising :           British, 13,000; Indian, 18,000;  a total of 31,000 combatants.    The  above are organized in          Four British, 12 Indian  battalions,  two Field Artillery brigades.    The  striking power of this force would be practically limited to the railway system.And here the  General Staff wish to observe that without resorting to the raising of fresh  troops by conscription or other means no British reinforcements will, be availablefor Turkey.    (ii.)  The present Turkish military forces available are as follows:          Regulars. -20 divisions, plus corps  troops ...    ...    ...    43,000         Unorganized Irregulars. Registered     ...    ...    ...   144,000*                                  Total  ............   187,000    This number would certainly be increased  to an extent which it is impossible atpresent to estimate accurately as soon as Nationalist operations become general.                 * 56,000 of these were actually enrolled on 20th October, 1919.    (B19/593)  70  12/19 H&amp;S  7S20wo
     4. The General Staff, therefore, endorse in every respect the requirement laid downin paragraph 14 of General M.ilne&apos;s above-mentioned despatch, that a timely forecast ofthe  peace  terms  should  be presented to the  British Commander, so that the roleassigned to him and the troops under his command may be considered  in the light ofthe  actual force  available to meet whatever situation the announcement  of the peace terms may create.  And they earnestly hope that      (a.) The execution of the terms will be in the hands of a British Commander.     (6.)  Only such terms will be seriously considered by His Majesty&apos;s  Government, in           the first place, as may be reasonably compatible with the  resources which           exist  or which it may be, intended to provide for their execution.     5. Without going into detail or the political pros and cons of the various questions,the General Staff wish to record the following list of measures which may be advocatedfor various reasons, but the enforcement of which, according to their  information, mightcall  for reinforcement  of the Army of the Black Sea, either by our Allies or furtherBritish levies :-        (i.) The  creation of  a Greater Armenia, linking  up Cilicia with the  Erivan             Republic.       (ii.) The creation of an independent Kurdistan.      (iii.) Acquisition by Greece of any portion of the Pontus.      (iv.) Permanent occupation by Greece of  any part of the Aidin Vilayet.       (v.)  Permanent occupation of any part of Southern Anatolia or  Konia by Italy,             though it is doubtful whether this would cause such  resentment  to the             Turks as any other of the above courses.     6.  In  addition to the above  measures, which would call for immediate reinforce-ments, the  adoption  of either  of the following  would  call  for the  retention  of apermanent garrison for a period which it is impossible to estimate :       (vi.) Acquisition by Greece of Eastern Thrace.      (vii.)  Expulsion  of the Turks from Constantinople.
