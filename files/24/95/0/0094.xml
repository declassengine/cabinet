Clemenceau,  ilr&amp;ulte essentiellement que, en presence del&apos;&amp;at d&apos;esprit aux Etats-Unis, du retardet des reserves apport^es a la ratificationdu  Traite de Paix avec 1&apos;Allemagne et du doute qui en r6sulte quant a la parti-cipation  effective  de 1&apos;Amerique  auxreglements politiques  europeens et orien-taux, la  France  et la Grande-Bretagnejugent indispensable a la paix du mondeet  a  1&apos;avenir de  1&apos;Europe  une entente troite entre elles.  Cette entente doit semanifester le plus tot  possible  par  unaccord sur les  questions  qui les int^res-sent et  a propos desquelles leurs pointsde vue n&apos;ont pas encore e*te ajust^s.   Ence qui concerne  le Gouvernement f rancais,il est pret a manifester Fint^ret primor-dial qu&apos;il attache a se tenir en  par faitaccord avec  la Grande-Bretagne en accep-tant les bases gen^rales suivantes, sauf aen preciser ulterieurement le detail:  I.  TURQUIE.  La conversation du11 d^cembre au  Foreign  Office entre MLLloyd George et Lord Curzon, d&apos;une part,le President  du  Conseil  francais de1&apos;autre,  a  permis  de   constater   que1&apos;opinion  du Gouvernement britannique6tait differente de celle du gouvernement francais sur certains  points importants.Cependant,  il  n&apos;est  pas  impossibled&apos;arriver a un compromis moyennant desconcessions de part et d&apos;autre.   Ce quisuit expose sur quels  points M.  Clemen-Clemenceau est dispose&quot; a se  rallier au point de vue britannique  et sur quels points il de-mande  1&apos;assentiment  britannique  auxconceptions franchises.  Les deux Gouvernements sont d&apos;accorden principe pour n&apos;admettre ni mandats,ni spheres d&apos;influence particulieres (sauf dans  les territoires de Syrie et de M6so- potamie  definis  dans  les  Accords  de 1916).      T18281  .        (English Translation.)  IN view of the present state of opinion in the United  States  of  America, thedelay in ratifying the Treaty of Peacewith Germany and the reservations whichhave been proposed in regard  to it, andthe resulting doubt as to the effective par-ticipation of America in the settlement ofEuropean and Eastern questions,  it wasdecided,  in the  course of the conversa-tions between Mr. Lloyd George and M.Clemenceau, that a complete understand-ing  between France and  Great Britainmust be regarded  as  necessary for thepeace of the world and for the future ofEurope.   This understanding should be demonstrated with as little delay as pos-sible by an  agreement on those questionswhich interest the two countries and inrespect of which their opinions have notyet been reconciled.   The French Govern-ment is ready for its part  to demonstrate  vital  importance it attaches  to  full agreement with  Great Britain by accept-ing the following general bases,  subjectto the working out of the  details later :   I. TURKEY.  As a result  of the con-versation on the 11th December at theForeign Office, between Mr. Lloyd Georgeand Lord Curzon on the one side and theFrench Premier on the other, it appeared that the  opinion  held  by the  BritishGovernment differed from that of theFrench Government on certain important points.  However, it  is  not  impossibleto arrive at a compromise by  concessions on  both   sides.   The   following  willmake clear the  points  on  which  M. Clemenceau is  prepared  to give way toHis Majesty&apos;s   Government  and  those where the assent of His Majesty&apos;s Govem- ment to the French views is asked.   Both   Governments  are   agree,d   in principle that neither mandates nor indi- vidual spheres  of influence shall be per- mitted (except in the territories of Syria and Mesopotamia  defined in  the  Agree- ments concluded in 1916).                               BFrench Note and Memoranda by the British Peace Delegation regarding                 Turkish Settlement. December 1919.No. 1.ote communicated by M. Berthelot to Lord (Jurzon of Kedleston.London, December 12, 1919.
(A.) Constantinople and the Straits.  In the course of the Conference held onthe 11th November, M. Clemenceau sup-ported the argument of maintaining the sultan at  Constantinople.  This opinion has many adherents in France, because  1her material and moral interests are moredeveloped in the former Turkish Empirethan are those of any other country.   Atthe present time she possesses the greaterpart of the railway capital and of  public and private enterprises, in which,  pre-vious to 1914, she had invested more than3 milliards of  francs;  she  holds  a  con-siderable  portion of the Ottoman  public debt, and exercised a predominating in-fluence in the administration of the cededRevenues  and of the Tobacco Regie. Hermoral influence was secured and  propo-gated by  the  hundreds of  schools andcharitable institutions, both religious andlay, distributed in all the towns  of theOttoman   Empire.   Moreover,  french public opinion is  favourable to the pre-servation  of the former Turkey, the sim-plicity  of the system appealing to manypractical  minds and being of  a  natureto  appease the susceptibilities of a re-constituted Russia.   Nevertheless,   M.   Clemenceau   isinclined to defer  to  the views held byHis  Majesty&apos;s  Government;  he  fullyappreciates the arguments relative to thedifficulty  of guarding the Straits withouta large military force, and heavy atten-dant expenses, if  Constantinople  and its500,000 inhabitants were to remain in thehands  of the Sultan, and,  as  a  con-sequence, at the mercy of the intrigues ofa militarily reorganised Germany, sup-ported perhaps by Russia.   Besides, by  her breaking of the Peace and those treaties which assured  her herterritorial integrity  and  sovereignty, Turkey has released  the Allied  Powers from  all obligations,  other   than the respect required by the guiding principles of their   own policy.  Her  action in closing the Straits and cutting  off the communication of Russia with the Allies was  the  cause of that Power&apos;s military and  political collapse, and  prolonged the war,  with all its  disasters.    Such a catastrophe must never occur again.    The  French   Government  therefore agrees to the following principles :     (1.)  Turkish  militarism to be  sup- pressed as was Prussian militarism.    (2.)  The guardianship of  the  Straits, from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, to  be given  over  to an international organisation,  which will  maintain  the effective  neutrality of the passage.(A.) Constantinople et  les Detroits.  M. Clemenceau a difendu, an cours dela Conference  dn 11 novembre, la thesedu maintien du Sultan a Constantinople,Cette these a de  nombreux partisans enFrance parce que les int^rets mat^riels etmoraux de la France sont plus developpesdans 1&apos;ancienne   Turquie   que  ceuxd&apos;aucun  autre pays.   Elle y possede  a1&apos;heure actuelle  la grande majority descapitaux des chemins de fer et des entre-prises d&apos;interet public et prive&quot; oil, avant1914, elle avail place&apos; plus de 3 milliards;elle possede une grande partie de la Dettepublique   ottomane  et   exerc^it  uneinfluence  pr^dominante dans 1&apos;admini-stration  dite des  Revenus concedes oudans celle de la Regie des Tabacs.   Soninfluence morale etait assured et propageepar  des centaines d&apos;ecoles et  d&apos;etablisse-ments de bienfaisance, tant religieux quelaiques, repartis dans toutes les villes  de1&apos;Empire ottoman.  Aussi 1&apos;opinion fran-9aise est-elle favorable au maintien  de1&apos;ancienne  Turquie,  systeme  dont  lasimplicite&quot; plait   a beaucoup  d&apos;espritspratiques  et  qui  menage les  susceptibilites-bilites d&apos;une Russie reconstituee.   Cependant, M. Clemenceau est disposea se rallier aux vues  du  gouvernement britannique : il appropriate cie a leur valeur lesarguments tires de la difficulte de garderles Detroits sans une force militaire con-siderable et de lourdes depenses, si Con-stantinople  et   ses  500,000   habitantsrestaient entre les mains du Sultan et parconsequent a la merci des intrigues d&apos;uneAllemagne reconstituee militairement  etpeut-etre appuy^e par  la  Russie.   D&apos;ailleurs, en  rompant la paix et  les traites qui assuraient son integrite terri- toriale et sa souverainete\ la Turquie a delie les  Puissances alliees de toute obli- gation autre que le respect des principes directeurs de leur politique.  En fermant les  Detroits, elle a coupe  les communica- tions de  la Russie avec les Allies, cause&quot; son efiondrement politique et militaire et prolonge la  guerre, avec  tous  ses d sas- tres: une telle catastrophe ne doit plus pouvoir se renouveler.   Le Gouvernement francais se rallierait done aux principes suivants:   (1.) Le militarisme ottoman sera sup- prime comme le  militarisme prussien.   (2.) La garde des Detroits, de la mer Noire a la  Mediterranee, sera confiee a une organisation internationale assurant la neutralite effective  du passage.
  (3.) L^s  Armeniens  seront  affranchisde la Domination turque.  (4.) Les  populations arabe et syriennene peuvent etre replacees sous la domina-tion turque.  On  sera ainsi   conduit  a   discernerquatre problemes:  (a)  Constantinople etles   Detroits,   (b)   Anatolie  ou   AsieMineure, (c) Armenie, (d) Syrie, Mesopo-lamie, Arabie.  Par tout, vivent cote acote  chretiens  et   musulmans.   Danschacune   des   regions  asiatiques  lamajority est musulmane. Mais les racesdifferent:  turque  en  Anatolie,  indo-europeennne en Armenie, somite en Syrie,Mesopotamie et Arabie.   Les minoriteschretiennes qui, dans la zone arabe et lazone armenienne sont de meme race queles  majoritds  musulmanes,  se  r^partis-sent entre trois eglises,  dont chacune a undomaine correspondant a celui d&apos;une desregions et  y  fait  prevaloir sa langue:grecque  en  Anatolie,  armenienne  enArmenie catholique et  de parler francosen Syrie.  En application  des  quatre  principesformules plus  haut, la garde des Detroitssera placee sous le controle  des Etat;mediterraneans,   France,   Angleterre,Italic (et peut-etre des petits Etats rive-rains interess^s, Grece  et Roumanie, bienqu&apos;il y  ait peut-etre  des  inconvenientsserieux a les meler a la question,  a causede 1&apos;etat d&apos;esprit turc).   La Russie s&apos;yajouterait  aussitot reorganised; quant a1&apos;Espagne,  elle ne possede pas d&apos;interetsdans ces regions.  Ce Conseil  de surveillance serait  pre-side   alternativement,  par   periodesannuelles,  par les  deux  pays  qui posse-dent en Turquie  des  int^rets  et  uneinfluence  preponderante, la  France etF Angleterre.  La liberty des D6troits ne sera garantieefficacement  que par  la neutralisationdes  rivages  des   Dardanelles  et   duBosphore.  On est  ainsi amene  a  con-stituer  autour de  Constantinople  unpetit Etat neutralise sous la garantie desgrandes  Puissances,  en  attendant laSociete&apos; des Nations; le territoire de cetEtat se  comiposera  du bassin  de la merde   Marmara  et   des  Peninsules  desDardanelles et de la Troade.  La popula-tion de 1&apos;Etat  serait fortement bigarree,comprenant des  Grecs orthodoxes,  desmusulmans de toute provenance, Turcs,Lazes, Kurdes, Arabes, Albanais,  200,000Armeniens,  50,000  Israelites,  40,000Europ&amp;ns,  etc.  Toutes ces   minoritesjouiraient  d&apos;une complete  egalite civileet  politique,   garantie  par  un  statutformel.  (3.) The Armenians to  be  freed  fromTurkish rule.  (4.) The Arabian  and Syrian peoplesnever again to be placed under  Turkishdominion.  There are thus  four problems to con-sider :  (a)Constantinople and the Straits,(&amp;)Anatolia or Asia Minor, (c) Armenia,(d) Syria,  Mesopotamia, Arabia.  Every-where  Christians  and Mussulmans are living  side by  side.   In each  of the asiatic regions the majority of the popu-lation is Mohamedan.  But the races are different:   Turkish  in  Anatolia,  Indo-European in Armenia, Semitic in Syria,Mesopotamia and Arabia.    The Chris-the minorities  who, in the Arab andArmenian  zones, are of the same race asthe  Mohamedan  majorities,  are  dis-tributed between three churches, each ofwhich has a domain corresponding to oneof the territorial areas and where  itslanguages  are  spoken i.e., Greek  inAnatolia, Armenian in Catholic Armenia,and  French in Syria.  In applying the four principles enume-rated above,  the guardianship  of theStraits will be placed under the control ofthe Mediterranean States,  France,  Eng-land, Italy (and  perhaps  the smallerinterested  border States,  Greece  and roumania, although there may be serious difficulties in  bringing  them into thematter, on account  of  Turkish publicopinion).   Russia will be added as soon as she is reorganised; as regards Spain, herinterests in this region are nil.  This superintending Council would bepresided annually by turns  by the twocountries   who  possess  preponderatinginterests and influence in Turkey, namelyFrance and England.  The freedom  of the Straits cannot be effectively guaranteed unless the shores ofthe  Dardanelles  and   Bosphorus areneutralised.  Thus it is seen  that a smallState must be constituted around  Con-stantinople, the neutrality of which willbe guaranteed by the Great Powers, pend-ing  the establishment of  the League ofNations.  The territory of this State will comprise the basin of the Sea of Marmoraand the Dardanelles and Troad Penin-sulas.  The population of the State wouldbe   very   mixed,  including  orthodoxGreeks, Mussulmans of all kinds, Turks,Lazes, Kurds, Arabs, Albanians, 200,000Armenians,  50,000  Israelites,  40,000Europeans, &amp;c.  All  these  minoritieswould enjoy  equal   civil  and  political rights, ensured by formal statute.
  L&apos;Etat nouveau reprendrait sa part dela Dette ottomane  et  des engagementscontracted par la Turquie.  Les  interets  existants de la Grande-Bretagne et de la France devraient etrerespected.  L&apos;Etat  aurait une   autonomie int6-rieure et serait administr6 par ou sous lecontrole d&apos;une  assemble elective.  Au point de vue moral et  historique1&apos;eviction d&apos;Europe d&apos;un Etat base sur le droit de conquete et 1&apos;oppression de racesdifferentes et  de civilisation superieurerepresente un triomphe  du Droit.   La.perte de  Constantinople marquera  auregard  des  musulmans  1&apos;eclipse  defini-tive des  pouvoirs  mysteVieux  que  sapossession  conferait   aux  descendantsd&apos;Osman sur les populations musulmanesrelevant de 1&apos;Angleterre et de  la France.La   prise  de  Constantinople par   lesTurcs avait  marque la  fin du moyen age.Leur exode marquera le debut des tempsnouveaux.(B.) Turquie cTAsie.  En  Asie   Mineure  subsisterait uneTurquie, sous la dynastie nationale  desOsmanlis,  parce que c&apos;est seulement  enAnatolie que les Turcs forment le fondde  la  population, avec  sur  la  frangecotiere  une  active  population grecque,nombreuse  surtout a  1&apos;ouest autour  deSmyrne et  au  nord  vers  Samsoun  etTrebizonde.   Cest un pays  de 500,000kilometres  carred et 10,000,000 d&apos;habitations-tants, ce qui correspond  a la surface  de1&apos;Espagne.    Nous  pourrions  accepterFid6e panturque de  reconstituer  ce  quireste de la Turquie autour des cinq villesdes  hauts  plateaux  (Koniah, Kaisarieh,Angora, Si was  et Erzeroum) sur la baselingudstique  et raciale  turque,  car  lesentiment national de la Turquie  d&apos;Asieest  profond  et nullement factice.   LeSultan, installe a Koniah,  continueraitd&apos;y  regner sous un controle financier tres&amp;roit,  et  avec une  organisation judi-ciaire   tudiee.   Les Puissances exerce-raient un controle financier au moyen  dudeveloppement de 1&apos;Administration de la dette publique ottomane, rendue  inter-nationale: cette Administration assure-rait la rentree de tous les impots et psaie-rait les depenses de PEtat dans des con-ditions qui seraient fixees de  maniere aassurer la reforme et le fonctionnementdes administrations ottomanes.  L&apos;Armee  turque  disparai trait, et lededarmement  indispensable  des   Turcsconduirait a Pinstitution d&apos;une gendar-merie commandee  par  des  instructeursallies.  Les paysans Turcs parmi lesquels  The new State would take over its shareof the Ottoman Debt and the engagementscontracted by Turkey.  The existing interests of Great Britain   ,&apos;and France would have to be respected.  The State would enjoy internal auto-autonomy, and it would be administered by orunder the control of an elected assembly.  From the moral and historical point ofview, the eviction from Europe of a Statefounded on the right of conquest and the suppression of different races of superiorcivilisation,   represents  a  triumph  of right.  The  loss of  Constantinople willmark in the eyes of Mussulmans the defi-nite  eclipse of those  mysterious powers which its possession conferred  to  thedescendants of Osman on the Mohamedanpeoples now dependent on England andFrance.   The capture of Constantinopleby the  Turks marked the end of  theMiddle Ages.   Their exodus will denotethe beginning of the New Age.(B.)  Turkey in Asia.  In Asia Minor there would continue tobe a  Turkey,  under the national dynastyof the  Osmanlis,  because  it is  only  inx\natolia that the Turks form the basisof the population, with an active Greekpopulation on the coastal fringe, particu-larly  numerous  in   the  west  aroundSmyrna and in the north towards Sam-soun and  Trebizond.  The country com-   .prises some 500,000 square kilometres andhas a population of 10,000,000,  and iscomparable to Spain in size.   The Pan-Turkish  idea  of reconstructing  whatremains of Turkey around the  five townsof the high plateaux (Konieh, Kaisarieh,Angora, Siwas and Erzeroum) on a, lin-guistic and Turkish racial basis might beaccepted,  since the national feeling  ofTurkey in Asia is deep and in no wiseartificial.    The   Sultan,  installed   atKonieh, would  continue  to reign,  but would be subjected to very strict financial control  and  with a carefully  devisedjudicial   organisation.     The  powers would exercise  a financial control  bymeans of  the  development of  an inter-nationalised Administration of the Otto-man  Public Debt.  This  administration would ensure the collection of  all taxes and would pay the expenses of the Stateunder conditions which would be fixed soas to ensure the reform and working othe Ottoman administrations.   ,  The Turkish Army would disappear,and  the necessary disarmament of  theTurks would lead to the establishment ofa gendarmerie,  commanded by  Alliedinstructors.    The   Turkish  peasants,

Les lies  du  Dodecanese,  dont  leshabitants sont grecs, seraient, conforme-ment  aux  desirs  de  ceux-ci  et  auxprincipes  admis  par  les  Allies,  rat-tach^es au Royaume de  Grece.  L&apos;occupation  italienne  d&apos;un  certainnombre de points d&apos;Asie Mineure,  qui aeu lieu contre les principes et malgre lerefus de la Conference de la reconnaitre,prendra fin  a plus forte  raison.   Desavantages  economiques,  par   exemple,dans les charbonnages d&apos;Heraclee,  pour-raient  etre  concedes  a   1&apos;Italie,   qui.d&apos;ailleurs  fera partie  du  Conseil  inter-national de 1&apos;Etat  neutre  de Constanti-nople et des, Detroits.  Une   satisfaction  serait  rechercheeegalement  pour les Turcs dans la regiond! Adana., aim  d&apos;apaiser  leurs  susceptibilites- bilites nationales :  la France,  qui pour des raisons strategiques ne peut renonceraux forts du Taurus,&apos; defense historique de   la  Syrie,  cherchera   une  formulerespectant la culture turque qui domine en  Cilicie.   Le maintien  d&apos;une  souve- rainete nominale d&apos;ordre spirituel  sur levilayet  d&apos;Adana   est  admissible  pournous.  Quant au littoral, il  semble que, meme dans 1&apos;antique Ionie,  il  soit preferable pour les Grecs  de ne pas se separer de 1&apos;Asie Mineure,  qui leur  offre  un large champ  d&apos;action s&apos;ils ne provoquent  pas le nationalisme turc par  une  annexion qu&apos;ils ne sont sans doute pas en etat de defendre constamment  par les  armes.Les Grecs pourraient recevoir en Thrace dans la region d&apos;d&apos;andrinople  de&quot; largessatisfactions; ils  participeraient  d&apos;ail- leurs a  1&apos;administration  de  Constanti- nople.  Les droits des minorites  devront faireFobjet de 1&apos;etude la plus attentive et degaranties  speciales.    II  ne  faut  pas oublier que  sous la denomination com-mune de Turcs, on comprend tous lesMusulmans   d&apos;Asie   Mineure:    des Albanais amends  par  le  Service  Mili- taire, des Bosniaques,  des Thessaliens, les Tatars Nagai immigres de Crimee, les Tcherkesses  . venus  du   Caucase,  les nomades Ynruts ou Turcomans, qui con- tinuent la vie  pastorale sous la tente.   L&apos;egalite  uniforme  selon notre con- cept occidental  ne  repond  pas  a  laamong whom soldiers were compulsorilyi&apos;ecruited, would be the first to welcome.such a course; the example of the Mongolsand of the Turks in Central Asia show show  even the  most warlike  and savagepeoples of the same stock have  easilyevolved .in the direction  of a peacefulpolitical life.  The islands of the  Dodecanese, theinhabitants of which are  Greeks, would,in conformity  with their own desires andwith  the  principles admitted by theAllies, be re-attached to the Kingdom of greece.,  The occupation by Italy  of  a  certainnumber of points in Asia  Minor,  con-trary to the principles and despite the refusal of the Conference^to  recognise the Italian action,  will cease a fortiori.The  economic advantages, for example,in the coal-mining districts, of Heraclea,might  be conceded  to  Italy,  besideswhich, she will  form part of the Inter-national Council of  the neutral State ofConstantinople and the Straits.  A  similar means  would be sought tosatisfy the Turks in the Adana region, inorder  to  appease  their national . sus-ceptibilities.  France, who,  for strategicreasons, cannot renounce  the rampart ofthe   Taurus the  historic   defence of Syria will seek  a  formula respecting the culture of the Turks who predominatein   Cilicia.    The   maintenance  of   a nominal  spiritual  sovereignty over thevilayet of Adana could be admitted byus.                         .  ;   In regard  to the  littoral,  it appearsthat  even in  ancient Ionia  it would be preferable for the Greeks not to separate from Asia Minor, which affords them  alarge field of action provided they do notprovoke the nationalism of the Turks byan  annexation,  which,  without  doubt,they are not  in  the position  to  defendcontinuously  by force  of   arms.   the greeks would receive  large concessions in Thrace, in the region of Adrianopleand would moreover have a part in theadministration of Constantinople.   The  rights of  the  minorities mustreceive the most careful study,  and beupheld by special -guarantees.  It must also  be  remembered  that  under  thedenomination of Turks, the whole of theMussulmans of Asia Minor are included :Albanians, brought thithsr  by MilitaryService, Bosnians, Thessalians,  Tartarswho  have immigrated  from the  Crimea,Tcherkesses from the Caucasus, nomadicYuruks or&apos;Turcomans, who continue to lead a pastoral life under tents.   Uniform equality as  understood byEurope? ^s cannot be  applied to these

Armenie.  LArmenie  forme  a Test  de  1&apos;AsieMineure une region differente par  sastructure physique et par ses populations,region montagneuse,  oil  la  race indo-europeenne s&apos;est  maintenue,  representedsurtout par  les Armeniens chretiens etpar les Kurdes musulmans.    Elle doitetre  organised separement et  le desircommun des Allies est de reconstituerune  nation  arm^nienne   independanteapres  les  massacres  par  lesquels   lesJeunes-Turcs , d&apos;accord  avec  les Alle-mands, ont system&amp;natiquement  essay6 dela faire disparaitre.  Cette nouvelle  organisation  presentede  grandes  difficultes  parce  que   lesArmeniens malgre 1&apos;anciennete de leurhistoire ne sont presque nulle part  unemajorite,   qu&apos;ils  n&apos;ont plus  de  cadrespolitiques malgre leur civilisation et leurintelligence et parce que le pays armenienproprement dit n&apos;a pas de debouche versla mer.  Les Armeniens sont,  comme lesJuifs,  un peuple disperse; toutefois, ilsse sont  moins   parpilles,  et,  meme a1&apos;etranger, se groupent en  communautes,et ils ont conserve leur noyau dans leurpatrie  historique,  ou  ils  forment   desgroupes compacts,  en Armenie russe, aupied  du  mont  Ararat,  sur  le  fleuvenational 1&apos;Araxe, aupres d&apos;Erzeroum,  surles rives du lac de  Van,  sur le  Haut-Euphrate et plus loin dans la valise duDjihoum sur les pentes  du Taurus versZeitoum.   Sinon  par leur nombre,  dumoins  par leur travail et leur intelligenceils  dominent  dans  cette  contree  de1&apos;ancien Royaume  de Grande-Arm^nie.  L&apos;Armenie  comprend   gebgraphique-ment  deux  parties: FArm&amp;iie russe(aujourd&apos;hui   Republique   dArmenieavec Erivan  pour capitals) et  1&apos;Armenieturque a cheval sur les six vilayets.   Entribes who  are too weak and interlockedto form any national unities;  the GreekArmenian and Kurd groups, placed side by  side  with  sedentary  and  nomadicTurks, will be able to have their own civil and   religious  legislation,   their  ownscholastic  and  benevolent  institutions,and even their own courts, mixed mattersbeing referred to mixed tribunals.  these groups, contributing as they would to theupkeep of  the  province and its sub-divisions, will elect, in proportion to their numbers   and  importance,   representa-tives who will be  instructed to supervise the employment  of their  subsidies  toworks of  general  interest  under  thedirection  of the  authorities  and  thecontrollers  of the provinces  and of theState.(C.) Armenia.  Armenia  forms in  the East of asia minor a distinct region because of  itsphysical  structure  and  population,  amountainous region  where the  Indo-European population, composed entirely of Christian Armenians and MussulmanKurds, v maintains  itself.   It  must  be organised  separately,  and  the  idea,common  among the Allies, is to  recon-struct an independent Armenian nation,after  the massacres, by which the YoungTurks,  in  agreement  with  Germany,have   systematically   endeavoured   toexterminate the inhabitants.  This new organisation presents great difficulties,  because the  Armenians,  inspite  of  their ancient history are prac-tically nowhere in a majority, and despite their  intelligence and civilisation, haveno  political framework,  and,  becauseArmenia proper has no outlet to the sea.The  Armenians,  like  the  Jews,  are ascattered people, yet they are less so, andeven   abroad,  group   themselves  intocommunities.   They  have  preserved a nucleus  in  their  historic home,  wherethey  form compact groups in RussianArmenia, at the foot of Mount Ararat, onthe banks of the national river of Araxes,near  Erzeroum, along the shores of LakeVan,  on  the  Upper  Euphrates,  andfurther away in  the valley of Djihoum,on the  slopes  of  the  Taurus  rangetowards Zeitoun.  If  not, by weight of numbers, at least by a capacity for workand  by  their   intelligence  they  pre-dominate in the  country of the ancientKingdom of Greater Armenia,   Geographically Armenia  is comprisedof   two   sections:  Russian &apos; Armenia(to-day  the Armenian  Republic  withErivan  as  its  capital)  and  TurkishArmenia astride the  six vilayets.

outre,  il  y a  sur les  bords du golfed&apos;Alexandrette un groupe armenien touta fait separe&quot;  et n&apos;ayant aucune liaisonavec  la  Grande-Armehie,  groupe  quirecevra de la France toute protection etappui.  Les  Armeniens, qui  se sentent sup6-rieurs  a leurs  voisins musulmans (Turcs,Lazes et  Kurdes) revendiquent la supre-matie  politique sur de  vastes provincesou ils ne formaient qu&apos;une f aible minor itememe avant les odieux massacres dont ilsont souffert.  Ils invoquent a la fois leurmartyre,  le droit d&apos;acces a la mer et dessouvenirs   historiques   pour  se  faireattribuer  des pays et des ports  situes aplus de  400 kilometres de la  Grande-Armenie (comme si les  Suisses  revendi-quaient tout le pays compris entre leurrepublique et le  rivage du Languedocafin d&apos;assurer leur acces  au  port  de cette).  L&apos;objection capitale a  ces pre-contentions  c&apos;est  qu&apos;une pareille extensionde 1&apos;Arm^nie aurait pour effet certain deplacer les Armeniens en minor ite defini-tive dans leur Etat des qu&apos;on y ferait uneconsultation sincere des populations.  IIest  plus   sens6  de   n&apos;attribuer   auxArm6niens que les pays ou ils etaient enmajorite avant 1895 ou avant 1914, pluscertains  districts  voisins oil ils repre-sentaient  une  fraction importante de lapopulation totale.  L&apos;acces a la mer leursera assure&quot; d&apos;une part par une ligneferree aboutissant  a, Batoum et de 1&apos;autrepar deux voies  ferrees  aboutissant  aConstantinople et a la Mediterranee.  AuXIXe  siecle,  c&apos;est vers Constantinopleque s&apos;orientait le trafic de leurs vallees, etleur besoin le plus urgent serait de con-struire la  ligne d&apos;Erzeroum a  Angora,branche  nord du chemin  de   fer  deBagdad arreted par le veto de la Russie.  Avant la guerre  1 million et demid&apos;Armeniens Russes vivaient au Caucase(dont 1 million 100,000 dans la republic-que d&apos;Armenie actuelle, auxquels il fautajouter 150,000  refugies au  cours de laguerre).  Au contraire dans les vilayetsde  1&apos;Armenie  Turque il  n&apos;y a  plusd&apos;Armeniens :  la population armeniennedes campagnes a ete massacree, deportee,ou  a  fui:  a Erzeroum  il  reste  500Armeniens sur 30,000 habitants; a Siwas,a  Diarb^kir il  n&apos;y  en a  que quelquescentaines.  Dans le reste de la Turquie, lepatriarche armenien  de Constantinopleestime qu&apos;a Theure actuelle le nombre desArmeniens s&apos;eleve a 600,000 dont 150,000dans  la capitale meme.    Ces 450,000autres  sont dissemined  dans  1&apos;EmpireTurc;  la moitie^ est  un element  citadin addition, on the shores of the Gulf of Alexandretta  is  an  entirely  separate group of Armenians having  no connec- tion with the greater Armenia, a group which will  receive every protection and support from France.   The  Armenians, who  feel  themselves superior to  their neighbours, the Mussul- mans (Turks, Lazes, and Kurds) demand a political supremacy over large regions, where they form only a  weak minority, even before the atrocious massacres which they have suffered.   They all  plead their martyrdom, the right of access to the sea, and historical memories,  as a  ground for claiming lands  and ports more  than 400 kilometres distant from Greater Armenia (as  if the Swiss were  to demand  all the land between their Republic and the banks of the Languedoc in order to ensure an outlet to the port  of Cette).  The chief objection to these pretensions is that such an extension of Armenia would have the certain result of placing the  Armenians in a definite minority  in their State as soon as the wishes of the population are sincerely consulted. It is more reasonable to assign   to the  Armenians  only  the countries where they were in  a majority before 1895 or before 1914,  together with certain neighbouring districts where they represented an  important section of the total population.   The outlet to  the sea will be better assured on the  one side by a railway terminating at Batoum  and on the other by two railroads terminating at Constantinople and the  Mediterranean. In the 19th century, the greater part of the trade of their valleys went towards Constantinople, and their most  urgent need would be to  construct  the line from  Erzerum  to  Angora, namely, the northern  branch  of  the railroad  to Bagdad, which was stopped  by the veto of Russia.   Before the  war,  1,500,000  Russian Armenians  dwelt  in  the  Caucasus (of whom there are at present 1,100,000 in the Armenian Republic, to which must be added 150,000 refugees during  the war). On the other hand,  there are no longer any Armenians  in  the vilayets of Turkish Armenia :  the  Armenian population of the  countryside  has  been  massacred, deported, or has fled;  at Erzerum there remain  500 Armenians in a population of  30,000,  and at Sivas and Diarbekir there are only a few hundreds.   In the remainder  -of  Turkey,  the   Armenian Patriarch  at  Constantinople  estimates that at the present time there are 600,000 Armenians, of  whom  150,000 are in the capital  itself.   The remaining 450,000 are  scattered   throughout the Turkish

Si  on ajoute enfin ceuxdes Armeniens  qui  peuvent  revenir  dePerse,  de  Bulgarie  et  d&apos;Amerique,  onpeut  estimer   qu&apos;on peut  reunir unepopulation de 4.00,000 ames pour recon-stitner F Armenie Turque.  Apres la population se pose la difficilequestion des limites.  En Armenie Russe,le nouvel Etat doit incorporer la plupartdes  territoires  contested  avec  lAzer-beidjan et  la  Georgie  (cest-a-dire  deHaut-Karabak,   Zanguezour,  quelquesdistricts  montagneux);. en un mot  labordure montagneuse orientale du HautPlateau Armenien jusqu&apos;aux  plaines  de1&apos;Araxe et de  la Koura.   En Armenieturque,  pour conserver la majorite aux400,000 Armeniens rapatried, quelle zonedoit leur  etre  attribute?   Le  vilayetd&apos;Erzeroum, qui contient 700,000  Musul-mans, a une preponderance turque  tropecrasante  et tient d&apos;ailleurs  moins  aucceur  des  Armeniens que la  region fon-cierement  et historiquement armeniennedu Lac  de Van, de la plaine de Bitlis etde  Mouch.    Logiquement,   1&apos;Armenieturque a  creer pourrait comprendre  lapartie orientale du  vilayet d&apos;Erzeroum(cette ville exclue) la plaine de Mouch etla region du lac de Van jusqu&apos;a la fron-tiere    persane.     La   limite   entreP Armenie  et  la  Turquie  serait ainsimarquee par une ligne allant d&apos;01ti aHassan Kala  exclus, passant  par  lemassif  du  Binkel-Dagh,  aboutissant  a1&apos;Est de Mouch et suivant au Sud la cretetres nette  du partage des eaux qui bordela plaine de Mouch et qui suit la rive suddu lac de Van pour  aboutir  a la regionKurde de Bach-Kala.   La realite et lalogique  laissent loin  le rive megalomaned&apos;une graiide Armenie  allant de Trebi-zonde a Alexandrette.  Pour creer cette Armenie unie, dont lamoitie (PArmenie  Turque) ndst encorequ&apos;une conception  theorique,  il faudrad&apos;abord proteger les elements  armeniensde P Armenie russe contre une populationTartare  ou  Kurde tres  hostile,  puisramener  dans   1&apos;Armenie  Turque  desquatre points de la Turquie  les Arme-niens disperses et les d^fendre contre lapopulation Kurdo-Turque qui s&apos;est par-taged  les terres:  une  force  de 20,000hommes  sera  nedessaire.   Pendant  2annees au  moins,  il faudra  assurer leravitaillement de ces Armeniens.   Une Empire ; half of them are town-dwellers, who  will never  consent  to  leave  their homes and businesses, and the other half is composed of peasants, who will perhaps accept the right to regroup themselves in the  Armenian State.   Finally,  adding those  Armenians who  may  be  able to return  from  Persia,   Bulgaria,   and America, there results an estimated popu- lation  of  400,000  people  with  which Turkish Armenia can be  reconstructed.   After  the  population, the   difficult question of  the boundaries comes  up.  In Russian Armenia, the new State should incorporate most of the contested  terri- tories between Azerbeidjan and Georgia (namely,  Karabak,  Zanguezour,  several mountainous regions); in short, the moun- tainous  Eastern  border of the  high Armenian plateau as far as the plains of the   rivers   Araxes  and  Kura.    In Turkish Armenia, in order to maintain a majority for the  400,000  repatriated. Armenians, what zone should be assigned to them ?    The vilayet of Erzerum, with its 700,000 Mussulmans,  contains  a far too heavy Turkish preponderance, and is moreover less acceptable to the Armenians themselves than the thoroughly Armenian region of Lake Van, of the plain otf Bitlis, and of Mush.   Logically,  the Turkish Armenia  to be created should comprise the  eastern portion of  the  vilayet of Erzerum  (but excluding this town), the plain of Mush and the  Lake Van region as far as  the  Persian frontier.   The boundary between Armenia  and  Turkey would thus be defined by a  line running from Olti up  to Hassan Kala, skirting the  Bingol  Dagh mountains, running up to the east of Mush,  and following in the south the well-defined ridge of the water-. shed which  borders on the plain of Mush, and which  follows the southern shore of Lake Van, and finally terminating in the Kurdish region of Bash-Kala.  The vain- glorious dream  of  a greater Armenia stretching  from Trebizond  to Alexan- dretta has thus no real or logical  basis in fact.   In  order  to  establish   this  united Armenia,  one-half  of  which (Turkish Armenia) is still only a theoretical con- ception, it  will be necessary in the first place to  protect the various Armenian elements of Russian Armenia against a population  of  bitterly hostile Tartars or Kurds, and afterwards to  collect from the  four quarters of  Turkey the scattered Armenians, and to protect them against the   Turkish-Kurd  population,  among whom the land is divided;  to do this a force  of  20,000  men will be  necessary. For two&apos; vears, at least, it will be neces-

Enfin on doit envi-sager le danger d&apos;une absorption russedes que la Russie se  sera reconstituee:la base de communication restera long-temps le Caucase et le pays a subi pro-fondement depuis plus d&apos;un siecle Fem-preinte russe.  On a longtemps admis que le debouchenaturel de 1&apos;Armenie  sur la  mer  etaitTrebizonde et Ton  pensait alors a rat-tacber la province  grecque du Pont - aP Armenie.   Mais   cette   solution  neresiste pas  a un examen  approf conditions:dans  le vilayet de Trebizonde 1&apos;elementmusulman represente 80  pour cent  parrapport  aux G-recs; le  pays  doit  donerester turc, de 1&apos;avis meme des Grecs, quiredoutent des massacres; en outre, la con-stitution  d&apos;une  voie ferree Erzeroum-Trebizonde se beurte en raison des seuilsmontagneux eleves a une quasi impossi-bilitd, d&apos;autant que la ligne ne ferait passes  frais.   Ce  debouch^ naturel  deP Armenie about it a Batoum et il n&apos;y aqu&apos;a  completer  la voie ferree  Tauris-Djoulfa-Chakhtakhti-Bougdachine,  par un embranchement entre Tauris,  centred&apos;echanges de la Perse du Nord et la merNoire.  La creation de  la  Grande-Armenie,meme reduite  a la reunion de 1&apos;Armenierusse et  de 1&apos;Armenie turque presentecFenormes  difficultes, repose avant toutsur 1&apos;emploi de la force armed et exige depuissants   capitaux.    Laquelle   desgrandes puissances  consentira a assumerde telles charges?  L&apos;Amerique y  parais-sait disposee, sous Faction de ses missiou-naires qui  cherchent a faire du prosely-tisme en Orient et de ses syndicats com-merciaux qui  y voient  des  debouchesinteressants:  mais  F opinion americaineparait maintenant hostile a tout mandatoriental.   La France  toujours  sympathetic-thique  a   P Armenie   ne  parait  passary to provide  for  the  victualling ofthese Armenians.  Financial and moralassistance will be necessary for the recon-struction  of  destroyed villages, the re-making of roads, the establishment andcompletion of  railways  from  Erzerumand  Maku.  All this will  involve  an expenditure of several hundred millions,in addition to  the grant of a very highannual subsidy.   And this is not all: the armenians must also be  protected fromthemselves,  for  they are  torn  by partystrife,  and even in the direction of theaflairs oif the country- intervention willbe necessary;  the more  so because thelong servitude  which the  Armenian hasundergone has -made him  lose confidence in himself.  Finally,  the danger of  a russian absorption, as soon as that nationnas recovered,  must not  be  overlooked:the primary line of communication for along time must remain the Caucasus, and ,for more  than  a century the country hasbeen cast  in a Russian mould.   It  has  been  long  admitted that thenatural outlet of Armenia to the  sea wasTrebizond, and it was then thought thatthe Greek province  of Pontus might beattached  to Armenia.  Yet this solutioncannot  be  maintained after  a  careful examination : in the vilayet of Trebizondthe Mussulman element represents 80 percent.,  with regard to the Greeks.  Thecountry must therefore remain Turkish,and even the Greeks  themselves advisethis,   although  they  are   in  fear ofmassacres; again, the construction of  arailroad  from  Erzerum  to Trebizond ispractically an impossibility, by reason ofthe mountainous fringes  of the country,and,  if accomplished, the railway wouldnot pay its way. This natural outlet forArmenia  is near  Batum  and there is nothing  but  to complete  the railway, Tabriz - Djulfa - Chakhtakhti  - Boug-dachnine, by a branch line from Tabriz,the   centre  of exchange  for NorthernPersia and the Black Sea.   The  creation of  a Greater Armenia,even  reduced to the reunion of  russian and Turkish Armenia, presents enormousdifficulties, is based before everything onthe  employment of  armed forces, andnecessitates heavy  expenditure.   which of the Great  Powers will  accept these responsibilities ? America appeared dis-posed to  do  so, by  the action  of itsmissionaries who tried  throughout theeast  to form converts, and by its com-mercial syndicates,  which were quick tosee  the  opportunities of the  land; butAmerican public opinion at the  presenttime seems to be hostile to the acceptance of any eastern mandate.

(D.)  Entente   franco-anglaise  avec  les      Arabes  (en Syrie, Palestine, Meso-      potamie et Arabie).  .  La question a et6 si  souvent discuteequ&apos;il n&apos;est pas utile d&apos;entrer aujourd&apos;huidans tous ses  details.    Les bases essen-tielles en sont d&apos;ailleurs posees dans lesaccords entre Francais et Anglais en 1912(Declaration   de  Lord   Grey)  et 1916(Lettres Convention Grey-Cambon), entreAnglais et Arabes en 1915 (Lettres  sir h. MacMahon et le Roi Hussein, juilletet octobre 1915)  entre Francais, Anglaiset Arabes  (Declaration du 11 novembre1918), a la Conference de la Paix (Reso-lution du  Conseil supreme du  15 sep-tembre 1919),  enfin entre les Frangais etles Arabes (Accord  verbal de principeentre Faysal et M. Clemenceau).  En realite  pour  que les  promessesfaites aux Arabes soient tenues et pourqu&apos;une entente commune et viable aveceux  et  entre  Francais  et  Anglais&apos; soitpossible, il est indispensable que  Faysal,qui a ete presente par le Gouvernementanglais  a  la - Conference de la Paix etaccepte  par celle-ci,  du consentement dela  France,   comme  representant  desArabes,  puisse  constituer  un  Royaumesyrien  homogene.    Le  gouvernement francais.   tenant  compte   de   1&apos;interetcommun et du desir manifeste si  souventet si fortement  par  le Gouvernementanglais, s&apos;est decide a faire a  Faysal lessacr iflces necessaires pour qu&apos;une ententeloyale et complete puisse s&apos;etablir. Maisil ne peut faire seul toutes les concessions.Aussi  tient-il  fermement  aux  pointssuivants:  les  limites   fixees   par   lesAccords  de  1916 seront  respectees,  letrace du chemin de fer anglais Caiffa aBagdad  ne   saurait  etre releve  versDamas, Palmyre, Deir el Zor et Mossoul,sinon il n&apos;y  aurait plus  d&apos;Etat syrienviable et independent sous  mandat fran-gais et tout accord avec Faysal  en par-ticulier serait rendu impossible.   (Lespretentions de FEmir arabe  taient bienplus considerables et de son cote&apos; il a faitde  grandes  concessions  sur   ses revesprimitifs pour s&apos;assurer une r alit  solidedu cote francais, en ne  cachant pas qu&apos;ilse  propose  egalement  de revendiqueraupres  des Anglais  pour la Palestine,Mossonl et le statut exact de la zone B.)  Pour arriver a une entente avec Faysal,la France a modifie grandement ses vues(D.) Anglo-French  Understanding  with    the  Arabs  (in  Syria,  Palestine,    Mesopotamia and Arabia).  The  question  has been discussed  so often-that it will serve no useful purpose to enter into all its details again to-day.The essential principles are moreover tobe  found set out  in   the agreements between the French and English in 1912(Lord  Grey&apos;s Declaration) and in 1916(Letters  of  Convention,  Grey-Cambon),between the English and Arabs in 1915(Letters, Sir H.  MacMahon  and king hussein, July and October 1915), betweenthe French, English and Arabs (Declara-tion of the 11th November, 1918),  at thePeace  Conference  (Resolution of  theSupreme Council of the  15th September,1919),  and finally between the French and arabs  (Verbal  Agreement  in  principle between  Feisal and M. Clemenceau).  In  fact, in order that the promisesmade to the Arabs may  be a,dhered to,and that a  common and lasting under-standing with them and between Frenchand English may be possible, it is  indis-pensable that Feisal, who was  presented by  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  to thePeace  Conference, and  accepted  by  it with the consent of France, as the  repre-sentative of the  Arab peoples,  should bein a position to constitute a homogeneousSyrian Kingdom.   The  French Govern-ment,  in conformity with the common interest  and the  desire  repeatedly andstrongly manifested by  Great Britain,decided to make  the necessary sacrificesto Feisal in order to establish a loyal and complete understanding.   But it cannotalone make all the concessions.. Accord-ingly,  it holds  itself  strictly  to thefollowing points :  the limits fixed  by theAgreement of 1916 will be respected, butthe track of the English railway fromHaifa to  Bagdad cannot be extendedtowards Damascus, Palmyra, Deir el-Zorand Mosul.  Otherwise no separate and independent Syrian State under Frenchmandate could be  maintained,  and evervagreement  with  Feisal  in  particularwould  become  impossible.   (The  pre-tensions of the Arabian Emir were muchmore considerable, and  for his part hehas  made   great  concessions on  his original  aspirations,   in order  to  be assured  of  solid  assistance  from theFrench,  not  hiding, however,  his  inten-tion of  demanding from  the  English,Palestine, Mosul and  the precise  status of  zone  B.)   In order to arrive at an understanding with  Feisal, France   has considerably
primitives.  Pour rester en plein accordavec  le  Gouvernement  anglais,   M.Clemenceau  est dispose egalement a sepreter a ses vues et a faire des concessionssur F Accord de 1916  en ce qui concerneMospoul et la Palestine, mais il ne  peut,sans renoncer h toute possibilite et a toutevaleur d&apos;un mandat  syrien, etendre leslimites Nord de la Palestine, jusqu&apos;a labanlieue   de  Damas  au  benefice desSionistes,  renoncer au Hauran  et  auxplaines fertiles qui dependent des couleesbasaltiques du  Djabel  Druz, abandonneraux  colonies juives toutes les eaux deDamas, accepter la modification de carac-tere  politique du  trac6 du chemin de ferandais, renoncer  non  seulement  a  Mos-soul  (qui d/ailleurs fait partie de  la zoneA independante arabe et non de  la zonebleue ou  devait   seulement   s&apos;etendred&apos;a/ores Faccord de 1916 Fadministrationdirecte  franchise,  fait  qui est  relev specialement par Faysal) mais a, FHinter-land du mandat  francais  a FEst et auNord.  Les  vues  francaises  sont  d&apos;ailleursraisonnables et conciliantes:  il est par-faitement possible d&apos;assurer aux coloniessionistes,  auxquelles  la  France  porteegalement beaucoup d&apos;int6ret, la disposi-tion  d&apos;une  proportion importante  deseaux des sources qu&apos;elles reclament, maisbien entendu sans abandonner la posses-sion territoriale qui causerait  un detri-ment capital a la Syrie et nous empeche-rait de nous accorder avec Faysal.  De  meme pour le  trace du chemin defer, s5il est reconnu necessaire, d&apos;un com-mun accord, apres examen contradictoireet pour des raisons techniques, d&apos;empieterlegerement sur la zone A, un  droit depassage peut etre concede, mais cela nepeut changer la souverainete territorialeni aboutir a une modification politique duchemin de fer anglais, qui,  de Caiffa aBagdad,  deviendrait un chemin  de ferCaiffa-Damas-Mossoul,  supprimant  enfait nos propres lignes et le mandat syrienfrancais.  Enfin la concession sur Mossoul, en ce qui touche la France, a pour contre-partieessentielle, reclamee par l&apos;industrie et leParlement frangais, la stricte egalit6 dansFexploitation des  petroles  de Medopo:tamie et du Kurdistan.  Ce  point a uneimportance capitale,  en  raison  de  laprivation  absolue et  des  besoins de  laFrance en p6trole.   Comme le fer et lecharbon, le petrole a pris dans la vie dumonde et comme element essentiel  de Fin-deoendance et de la &quot;Self Defence&quot; desmodified her  original views.  For thepurpose of remaining in full accord \\ ithBritain,  M. Clemenceau is equally pre-pared to endeavour to meet the views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and to make concessions on the Agreement of 1916, inso far as Palestine and Mosul are con-cerned.   He  cannot,  however,  withoutrenouncing  entirely a Syrian mandate,agree to the extension of the northernlimits of Palestine up to the outskirts of damascus for  the benefit of the Zionists,renounce  the  Flauran  and  the  fertileplains dependent upon the basaltic out-crops of the Djabel Druz, abandon ail the waters  of  Damascus  to  the  Jewishcolonies,  accept the  modification  in  apolitical sense  of the track of the Englishrailway,  nor  renounce not  only Mosul(which, moreover,  forms part of  theindependent Arab  zone  A,  and  not ofthe blue  zone,  where alone, according tothe Agreement  of  1916, direct french administration should  be exercised,  a fact which is specially raised by Feisal),but also in the hinterland of the Frenchmandate in the east and north.  The French  views are after all reason-able and conciliatory; it is- quite possibleto assure the  Zionist colonies, in which France  also takes  a  great interest, thedisposal  of an important proportion ofthe waters which they demand, without,of course,  abandoning their  territorialpossession,  which  would  greatly depre-associate the resources of Syria, and preventFrance from coming to an understanding with Feisal.  Similarly with the  track of the rail-way; if it  is recognised as necessary, by common  agreement, and after  a  jointexamination and for  technical reasons,to encroach slightly on zone A, a  rightof passage  may be conceded.   This willneither affect the territorial possessionnor lead to a political modification of theEnglish   railway,  which,   instead  of running from Haifa to Bagdad,  wouldbecome  a  railway   from   Haifa  toDamascus  and Mosul, and would thus infact suppress French lines.and the FrenchSyrian mandate.   Finally, the Mosul concession in so faras  France  is concerned  entails,  as anessential compensation demanded alike by industry and  by the French Parliament,strict  equality  in the  exploitation ofpetroleum  in Mesopotamia  and Kurdi-stan.   This point carries great impor-tance, by  reason of the absolute lack ofpetroleum in France and her needs   Likeiron and coal, petroleum has assumed  a vital part in the independence and &quot;self-defence &quot; of all the nations of the world.

They will only come in question so far as they are affected by the present settlement.   Several suggestions  will similarly  be made on the subject of eventual economic understandings, especially with regard to the regime of the great international rail- ways so essential to the development of civilisation.

No. 2.First part of M. Berthelot&apos;s note of the 12th December with comments of Political                    Section of British Peace DelegationBritish Observations.No comments on this paragraph.  We are in general agreement with thefirst paragraphs  of the French  Memo-randum, and note with satisfaction the degree to which the French Governmentare prepared to meet  the  views  of HisMajesty&apos;s Government.  Presumably   the   words   &quot;spheresd&apos;influence particulieres&quot;  are  intendedto cover spheres of  economic  priority.We are doubtful if it may not  be neces-sary to give  Italy some such sphere in southern Anatolia in order to secure thewithdrawal of her troops.

Ce quisuit expose  sur quels  points M.

  This is true, but it must be rememberedthat British  commercial  interests were,before the war, nearly twice those of anyother Power.   For  instance,  in 1913Great Britain  had  26.7  of the wholetrade of Turkey (imports  and exports),Germany 14.7, France 12.3, Austria 12.2,and Italy 10.5.We agree generally to all 4 points.du maintien du Sultan a Constantinople.Cette these a de nombreux partisans enFrance parce que les interets materiels etmoraux de la France sont plus developpesdans  1&apos;ancienne   Turquie   que  ceuxd&apos;aucun  autre pays.  Elle y possede a1&apos;heure  actuelle la grande  majorite descapitaux des chemins de fer et des entre-prises d&apos;interet public et prive ou, avant1914, elle  avait place plus de 3 milliards;elle  possede  une  grande  partie de la dette Publique Ottoman et exercait uneinfluence  predominate  dans Padmini-stration  dite  des Revenus concedes oudans celle de  la Regie  de  Tabacs.   Soninfluence morale etait assuree et propageepar des centaines  d&apos;ecoles et d&apos;etablisse-ments de bienf aisance, tant religieux quelaiques, repartis dans toutes les villes deFEmpire ottoman. Aussi Fopinion fran-gaise  est  elle favorable au maintien deFancienne Turquie,  systeme dont la sim-plicite plait  a beaucoup d&apos;esprits pra-artistiques et qui menage les susceptibilitesd&apos;une Russie reconstituee.  Cependant M.  Clemenceau  est dispose&quot;a se rallier  aux  vues du gouvernement britannique : il apprecie a leur valuer lesarguments tires de la difficulty de garderles Detroits sans une force militaire con-siderable  et de lourdes  depenses si Con-stantinople   et  ses  500,000  habitantsrestaient  entre les mains  du Sultan etpar consequent a  la merci des intriguesd&apos;une Allemagne  reconstituee militaire-ment et peut-etre appuyee par la Russie.  D&apos;ailleurs, en rompant la paix et lestraites qui assuraient son integrity terri-toriale  et sa souverainete&quot; la Turquie adelie  les  Puissances  alliees  de  touteobligation autre que le  respect des prin-cipes directeurs de  leur politique.   Enfermant les Detroits, elle a coupe&quot; les com-munications de la Russie avec les Allies,cause son  effrondrement politique et mili-taire et prolonge la  guerre,  avec tous sesdesastres: une telle catastrophe ne doitpouvoir se renouveler.  Le Gouvernement francais se  interalliees-rait done  aux principes suivants:  (1.) Le militarisme ottoman sera sup-primd comme le militarisme prussien.  (2.) La garde des Detroits, de la MerNoire a la Mediterraned,  sera  confine aune organisation internationale assurantla neutralite effective du passage.  (3.) Les Armehiens  seront affranchisde la domination turque.  (4.) Les populations  arabe  et syriennene peuvent etre replacees sous la domina-tion turque.  On  sera  ainsi conduit  a  discernerquatre problemes : (a) Constantinople et
  We agree to conclusions, but, as a pointof  detail,  the   statement   that   the christian minorities are of the same raceas Musulman majorities in Armenia maybe contested.  We  agree,  but would  wish to  putforward  the  possibility  of subsequentAmerican as of Russian participation.We accept also the principle of the par-ticipation of other interested States, suchas Greece and Roumania, on  condition that the  real voting  power is left in thehands of the principal Allied and Asso-ciated  Powers.    We would,  however,point out that, unless the control is fromthe first confined to the latter, it may bedifficult,  if not  impossible, to excludeGermany, Bulgaria,  and Turkey, if andwhen, they become members of the Leagueof Nations.  We  are  prepared to accept french proposals regarding  Chairmanship, butwe venture to suggest that, if the Chair-manship of the  Commission were  eitheroffered   permanently to  the  Americanmember (on the assumption that Americaparticipates at  once)   or  were   maderotatory,   less   hostility   from   other interested States  would be encountered,as the predominance of France and GreatBritain   would  not  be  so  definitelymarked.   We agree generally, but are not whollyin  favour of including a  zone  on the asiatic shore.  There might be legitimateeconomic objection  to  cutting off theTurkish interior from such natural out-lets as Haidar Pasha, Mudania and Pan-derma.   Moreover,  the  settlement,  as  awhole, would appear more arbitrary and less  acceptable  to Moslem feeling, and,therefore, more difficult of enforcement,if any part of Asia  were included in the zone.   No clearly corresponding advan-tage to  the Allies would,  on  the  otherhand, be gained. There is, however, muchto be said on commercial grounds for in-eluding  the Ismid  Peninsula  up  to theShile-Ghebse line in the zone,  as theeconomic life of the  two sides of the Bos-phorus largely  interpenetrate, and the les  Detroits,  (b)  Anatolie   ou  Asie Mineure, (c) Armenie, (d) Syrie, Mesopo- tamie, Arable.   Partout,  vivent cote a cote  chretiens  et  musulmans.    Dans chacune   des   regions   asiatiques   la majorite est musulmane.  Mais les races different:   turque  en  Anatolie,  Indo- Europeenne en Armenie, semite en Syrie, Mesopotamie et Arabic   Les minorites, chretiennes qui, dans la zone arabe et la zone armenienne sont de meme race que les  majorites  musulmanes,  se repartis- sent entre trois eglises dont chacune a un domaine correspondent a celui d&apos;une des regions  et  y fait  prevaloir sa  langue : grecque   en  Anatolie,  armenienne   en Armenie catholique et de par ler frangais en Syrie.   En application  cles quatre principes formules plus haut, la garde des  Detroits sera placee sous  la  controle  des Etats Mediterraneans,   France,    Angleterre, Italie (et peut-etre des petits Etats rive- rains interesses, Grece et Roumanie, bien qu&apos;il y  ait peut-etre des  inconvenients serieux  a les meler a la question a cause de  FEtat  d&apos;esprit turc:  la Russie s&apos;y a j outer ait  aussitot reorganised :  quant a 1&apos;Espagne,  elle ne  possede pas d&apos;interets dans ces regions.  Ce  Conseil de surveillance serait pre-side  alternativement,   par   periodesannuelles par les deux pays qui possedenten&apos; Turquie  des interets et une influencepreponderante, la France et YAngleterre.  La liberte des Detroits ne sera garantieefficacement que par la neutralisation desrivages des Dardanelles et du Bosphore.On est ainsi amene a constituer autour deConstantinople un petit Etat neutralisesous la garantie des grandes Puissances,en attendant la Societe des Nations; le territoire de cet etat se composera  duBassin de la  Mer  de Marmara et desPeninsule  des  Dardanelles   et  de  laTroade.   La population de FEtat seraitfortement bigarree. comprenant des Grecsorthodoxes,  des Musulmans de toute pro-venance, Turcs, Lazes, Kurdes, Arabes1,Albanais,  200,000  Armeniens,  50,000Israelites, 40,000 Europeans, etc.  Toutesces minorites  jouiraient d&apos;une completeegalite civile et politique, garantie par unstalut formel.
line  forms  a  convenient  geographicalfrontier.  Shile may also be developed asa health resort, attract visitors  and be-come a desirable source of revenue to the zone.  For purposes of defence it would onlyseem necessary to demilitarise an area (15to 20 miles deep)  from a point oppositeTenedos to Shile, to demolish all f ortifica-tions and to ensure permanent rights of-landing and inspection for the officers ofthe zone on the Asiatic shore.  A mixedmilitary and naval  Commission might also be  appointed under  the Treaty ofPeace to consider  and recommend to theAllies what military and naval fortifications-tions should be maintained  and trans-ferred to the international Adminstrationon the European shore of the Dardanelles,Bosphorus and Sea of  Marmora, with  aview to safeguard freedom of navigationthrough the Straits  in peace and war.All fortifications other than those whichthe Commission should decide to be neces-sary  for the above  purposes  should bedemolished.   The revenues of the  new internationalState will probably not suffice for sometime to meet the expenses of the Admin is-tration.  It will be for the governments represented in the Administration to con-sider whether they will be  prepared to advance to the new State a sum of moneyto cover the immediate deficit between theannual budget of  the State and the totalrequired to pay  the expenses and  the service of the State &apos;s allotted portion ofthe pre-war Ottoman Debt, or whether  itwould  not be preferable  to  relieve the State of the payment of this debt service for a certain number of years and recoup the bondholders from other sources.   We  are  in  general agreement.   In greater detail our views are as follows :  The International Commission of the new-State would have legislative  authority, and  the executive would consist of the necessary departments (Interior, Justice, Defence, Public Health and Instruction, Finance and  Customs,  Public Works, Commerce and  Navigation,  Posts  and Telegraphs and Evkaf).   These would  be staffed  by natives in all the  subordinate posts,  and consist  largely of foreigners chosen  irrespective of nationality in the higher ones.   All appointments would  be made by the Commission.  representation of the governed in the matter of legisla- tion is an eventual  necessity.  The pre- transferable and, indeed, the only practical, course is that this should be elaborated  by the  Commission  after full  consultation with the inhabitants of the new State.  L&apos;Etat nouveau reprendrait sa part dela Dette ottomane et des engagements con-tractes par la Turquie.  Les interets  existants de  la  Grande-Bretagne et de la France devraient etrerespected,  d&apos;Etat aurait une autonomieinterieure et serait administre par ou sousla controle d&apos;une assembled elective.
    We are again in general agreement.  Two  points, however must be noted:     1.  The French memorandum speaks of  &quot;une organisation judiciaire  etudiee.&quot;  This question has already been considered  both by Paris and  by  the Allied Repre-  sqntatives at  Constantinople.    It  is  generally accepted that the capitulations  in their  pre-war form must disappear.  The  question  of the regime to succeed  them  being,  however,  excedingly  corn-  plicated, there is equal agreement  that a special Commission must be constituted under the treaty to elaborate the  neces- sary details on the spot.   2. We  agree  that  financial oontrol should be very  close  (&quot;tres  &amp;roit&quot;). The French proposal,  however, contem- plates that it should be exercised through a   developed    and    internationalised administration of the Public Debt, which would, in  fact, control  the budget of the country.   With this proposal we only  partially agree.  The method which we  advocate is rather that the financial control should fall into three categories :    (a.)  A revised debt administration as       proposed by the French.   (&amp;.)  An international currency board.   (c.)  Detailed control through  an inter-       national financial commission of       the  Ministry  of  Finance  and all       financial  departments.   His  Majesty&apos;s Treasury have long and carefully   investigated  this   question. They have come to the conclusion that the gravity of  the  economic and  financial situation in Turkey involves riot only the interests of the bondholders but the entire industrial and commercial reconstruction of the  country.   Something more, there- fore, than a reform of the debt adminis- tration is essential.    Details of  theBritish proposals are in readiness.    Au  point  de vue moral et historique Peviction d&apos;Europe d&apos;un Etat base&quot; sur le droit de conquete et 1&apos;oppression de races differentes et de civilisation  superieure represente un  triomphe du Droit.   La perte  de  Constantinople  marquera  au regard des Musulmans 1&apos; eclipse definitive des pouvoirs mysterieux que sa possession conferait aux  descendants d&apos;Osman sur les populations musulmanes relevant de 1&apos;Angleterre  et de la France.   La  prise de  Constantinople&apos; par les Turcs  avait marque la fin du moyen age.  Leur exode marquera le debut des temps nouveaux. (B.) Turquie oVAsie.   En  Asie  Mineure  subsisterait  une Turquie, sous la dynastie  nationale des Osmanlis, parce que c&apos;est  seulement en Anatolie que les Turcs forment le fond de la  population, avec sur la frange cotiere une active population grecque,  nombreuse surtout a 1&apos;Ouest autour de Smyrne et au Nord vers Samsoun et  Trehizonde. Cest un pays de 500,000 kilometres carres et 10,000,000 d&apos;habitants, ce qui correspond a  la surface de FEspagne.   Nous pour- instructions accepter Fidee panturque de recon- stituer  ce qui reste de la Turquie autour des  cinq  villes  des   hauts   plateaux (Koniah, Kaisarieh,  Angora,  Siwas  et Erzeroum)  sur la base  linguistique et raciale  turque, car le sentiment national de  la Turquie  dAsie est profond  et nullement factice.  Le  sultan,  installe a Koniah, continuerait d&apos;y regner sous un controle financier tres etroit,&apos; et avec une organisation  judiciaire  etudiee.   Les Puissances exerceraient un controle finan- cier  au  moyen du  developpement de PAdministration de la  Dette  Publique Ottomane, rendue internationale:  cette Administration assurerait la rentree de tous les impots et paierait les depenses de PEtat dans des  conditions  qui seraient fixers de maniere a assurer la r^forme et le   fonctionnement  des  administrationsottomanes.
  We fully  agree  in the suppression ofthe Turkish  army.   We presume that theFrench Government contemplate also the suppression  of the Turkish; navy.  TheBritish scheme aims at the control of  allTurkish Departments of State, and there-fore  of  the gendarmerie through  theMinistry oif  the Interior.   We agree as regards the attribution of the Dodecanese to Greece.   We under- stand that a secret agreement has already been  reached  between Italy and Greece on this point.   We are in entire agreement as to the necessity  of a speedy termination of the unwarranted   Italian  occupation   of Southern  Anatolia.  The French Govern- ment appear, however, to expect that this can be effected by specific economic con- cessions to Italy,  such as the coal mines ofHeraclea, and the Italian participation. in the administration of the new State of the Straits.   In  view of the  Treaty of London, we fear that greater inducement than  this will be required.  We suggest that this  might  take the form, of priority of commercial enterprise in a zone of Southern Anatolia, as well as of partici- pation in the international control of the Tulrkish  Government.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have an additional lever in the  extent  of  the  cession of  territory which Italy desires to obtain from them in Africa.   We are disposed to accept the French view  in  regard  to  the   occupation  of Cilicia.   We  await,  however,   fuller explanation of what is understood by the words &quot;Le maintien d&apos;une souverainete nominale d&apos;ordre  spirituel sur le vilayet d&apos;Adana est admissible pour nous.&quot;  This paragraph gives rise  to  serious and  complicated  considerations.   Theproblem would no doubt have been simpli-fied  if  the  Greek  occupation  of  the smyrna area had not been sanctioned bythe Supreme Council, at any rate at a date  so  long before the  final  Turkishsettlement;  but  it  would  seem  that inpractice the Supreme Council is to someextent committed to  the continuance ofthe Greek occupation.  At any rate thisoccupation has been prolonged for such aperiod that a Greek evacuation  at  this  L&apos;Armee  turque  disparaitrait  et ledesarmement  indispensable  des  Turcsconduirait a 1&apos;institution d&apos;une gendar-merie commanded par  des instructeursallies.   Les paysans turcs parmi lesquelsles  soldats etaient  recrutes par la con-trainte   seront  les  premiers  a  s&apos;enfeliciter:  1&apos;exemple  des  Mongols et desTurcs de 1&apos;Asie Centrale montre commentles peuples les plus belliqueux et les plusferoces de meme race ont aisement  evoluevers une vie politique pacifique.  Les lies du Dodecanese, dont les habitations-tants  sont grecs, seraient conformenientaux desirs de ceux-ci et aux principesadmis  par   les  Allies,   rattachees  auRoyaume de Grece.  Inoccupation  italienne  d&apos;un certainnombre  de points d&apos;Asie Mineure, qui aeu lieu contre les principes et malgre lerefus  de la Conference de la reconnaitre,prendra  fin  a  plus forte raison.  Desavantages  economiques,  par  exemple,dans les charbonnages d&apos;Heraclee, pour-raient  etre  concedes  a  F Italie,  quid&apos;ailleurs fera partie du Conseil Interna-tional de FEtat neutre de Constantinopleet des Detroits.  Une  satisfaction  serait  rechercheeegalement pour les  Turcs dans  la regiond&apos;Adana,  aim d&apos;apaiser leurs  susceptibilites-bilites nationales:  la France,  qui  pourdes raisons strategiques ne peut renonceraux forts  du Taurus, defense historiquede la Syrie, cherchera une  formule res-pectant la culture turque qui domine enCilicie. Le maintien cTune souverainetenominale  d&apos;ordre spirituel  sur  le vilayetd&apos;Adana est admissible pour nous.-  Quant au littoral, il semble que, memedans  Fantique Ionie, il soit preferablepour  les Grecs, de  ne  pas  se separer deL&apos;Asie Mineure,  qui leur offre un  largechamp d&apos;action, s&apos;ils ne provoquent pasle nationalisme turc par une annexationqu&apos;ils ne  sont sans  doute pas en etat dedefendre  constamment par les armes.Les Grecs. pourraient recevoir en Thracedans  la region d&apos;d&apos;andrinople de  largessatisfactions;  ils  participeraient d&apos;ail-leurs  a  F administration  de  Constan-tinople.
stage can hardly be decided upon withoutconsidering  the  possible political  effect,not only on the present Greek  Govern-ment but  also on the Nationalist  move-ment  in  Turkey.    The  zone  roundSmyrna, comprising  more or  less  thepresent line  delimited as a strategicalfrontier by General Milne  but excludingAidin, may, have to be  ceded to Greece.In this connection the  proposal for theTurkish disarmament and Allied controlof  the  Turkish  gendarmerie  shoulddiminish the chances of a continuance ofthe present guerilla warfare on the fron-tier  of the  zone.   This cession  could,moreover, be  justified  as  far  as  theSanjak of Smyrna is concerned on a basisof nationality (the Greeks being  beforethe war in a majority in the Sanjak of smyrna),  and  the  extension  from theSanjak to the present line  of occupationcan be  justified on the ground of strategy.If this cession took place Greece would,of course, have to sign a treaty containingstringent stipulations regarding freedomof commerce and transit via Smyrna, and fully protecting minority rights.  On the other hand, the Smyrna  regionis important  as an economic outlet toAnatolia.  If, therefore, it be decided, aswe propose, that European Turkey up tothe Enos-Midia line should be  ceded to greece, it should be possible to arrange with M. Veniselos  a compromise some-what as follows  :   Smyrna should be left under nominalTurkish sovereignty with  a  vali  chosenwith the consent of the Powers and acting in council.  The latter would be composedof the representatives  of  the  principal allied  (and Associated) Powers,  with,however,   adequate   and   proportional representation of local interests  (both,Greek and Turkish).  This would  reduceTurkish  sovereignty  to  an  agreeablefiction, and, at the same  time, provideproper safeguards  for the non-Turkishelements.   A further grave question is raised bothin the French Memorandum and  by theBritish  proposals,  i.e., the  future ofAdrianople.   It is clear that if (a) the Turk is to beexpelled from Europe, (&amp;)  the new inter-national State  is  limited by the Enos-Midia line (and this we consider to be theonly practical course),  Adrianople mustbe either Greek or Bulgarian.   Ethnologically, the latter solution haslittle  to  recommend  it,  the Moslemelement in so far as it is non-Turk beingPomak and non-Bulgarian, while,  politi-
cally, objection may well be felt againstso rewarding an enemy State.   Ethnologically,  the  Greeks  have  abetter claim.  If, however, they obtain itas some sort of compensation or induce-ment for the evacuation of Smyrna, it isproposed that the system of the  vali incouncil, suggested above  for the Smyrnaarea,  should   be   applied,   Mutatis Mutandis, to the Adrianople  area.   Inthis case the majority of the council ofthe Greek Governor would be Moslem.   We are  in  general  agreement:  therights of non-Turkish elements might be safeguarded  by a special treaty for theprotection of minorities on the lines ofthose already negotiated with the smallerEuropean Powers.  The effective workingof these provisions would be part  of theduty of the Allied advisers of the TurkishGovernment.  This minority treaty, likethe  other  minority treaties, would  beplaced under the aegis of the League ofNations.  It  might even be possible  tostipulate in the Treaty that the  Leagueof Nations,  which  is understood to bealready regarded  by  Turkish  eyes   assomething holy and magnificent,  shouldhave power  to disallow legislation whichis  reported  by  the Allied  adviser  oradvisers  in  control  of  the  TurkishDepartment  initiating the legislation tobe  directed  against  the  legitimateinterests of  any minorities of the popula-tion.  We wish to make no comments on the observations  contained in the first  fiveparagraphs of the Armenian part of the prench   memorandum   regarding  thegeography   and  population   of  the armenian territories, with which, exceptfor a point of detail dealt with below, weare in  general agreement,  and  whichcoincides roughly with a proposal alreadyworked  out  by  the  British  PeaceDelegation.

 histoire ne sont presque nulle part une majorite  qu&apos;ils n&apos;ont  plus  de cadres politiques malgre leur civilisation et leur intelligence et parce que le pays Armenien proprement dit n&apos;a pas de  debouche vers la mer.  Les Armeniens, sont comme les Juifs,  un peuple disperse;  toutefois, ils se sont moins   eparpilles,   et,  meme a Petranger, se groupent en  communautes et ils ont conserve leur noyau dans  leur patrie  historique  ou  ils  forment  des groupes compacts en Armenie russe, au pied  du  mont  Ararat,  sur le fleuve national PAraxe, aupres d&apos;Erzeroum, sur les rives&apos; du lac de Van,  sur le Haut- Euphrate et plus loin  dans la vallee du Djihoum sur les pentes du Taurus vers Zeitoum.  Sinon par  leur nombre,  du moins par leur travail et leur intelligence ils dominent dans cette contree de Pancien Royaume de Grande-Armenie.   L&apos;Armenie  comprend geographique- ment  deux  parties:  F Armenie  russe (aujourd&apos;hui Republique d&apos;Armenie avec Erivan pour capitale) et PArmenie turque a cheval sur les six vilayets.  - En outre, il y a sur les bords du golfe d&apos;Alexandrette un groupe armenien tout a  fait separe et n&apos;ayant aucune  liaison avec la Grande- Armenie, groupe qui recevra de la France toute protection et appui.   Les Armeniens,  qui se sentent  supe- rieurs a leurs voisins musulmans (Turcs, Lazes et Kurdes) revendiquent la supre- matie politique sur de vastes provinces ou ils ne formaient qu&apos;une faible minorite meme avant les odieux massacres dont ils ont souffert.   Ils invoquent a la fois leur martyre,  le droit d&apos;acces a  la mer et des souvenirs historiques pour se faire at- tribuer des pays et des ports situes a plus de 400  kilometres de la Grande-Armenie (comme si les Suisses revendiquaient tout le pays compris entre leur republique et le rivage du Languedoc afin d&apos;assurer leur acces au port de  Cette).   L&apos;objection capitale a ces preventions  c&apos;est qu&apos;une pareille  extension  de PArmenie aurait pour effet certain de placer les Armeniens en minorite definitive dans leur Etat  des qu&apos;on y ferait une consultation sincere des populations.   II est plus sense de n&apos;attribuer aux  Armeniens  que les pays ou ils etaient en  majorite avant 1895 ou avant 1914, plus certains districts voisins ou ils representaient une  fraction  im- portante de la population totale.  L&apos;acces a la mer leur sera assure d&apos;une part par one ligne ferree  aboutissant  a Batoum et de P autre par deux voies ferrees aboutis-&apos; sant a Constantinople et a la Mediter- ranee.

La limite   We  agree generally  with the  limits   entre  PArmenie  et  la Turquie  serait proposed for that part of present Turkish   ainsi marquee par une ligne allant d&apos;01ti territory  which is  to be  attached  to   a  Hassan Kala  exclus, passant par  le
 Caucasian Armenia.  But we feel con- vinced that the town of Erzerum and the district immediately to the west should be included, and not excluded as proposed by the French.  For  this, prior to  the massacres,  there was full  ethnological justification.   On  the other hand if it were  excluded, a  strong  fortress, from which a  railway  now  exists  running right  into future  Armenian  territory, and the command of a vital valley would be left in the hand of Armenia&apos;s most dangerous  enemy.   Southern  Armenia might thus be easily cut off from Northern Armenia.   We agree generally as to the financial and military resources  required  for the creation  of the  new Armenian  State. We  suggest,  however,  (a) as  regards finance, once the recognition of Armenian independence is given, the Government of Armenia are hopeful of obtaining finan- cial assistance from private sources, par- ticularly  American,   and  (b)  that  as regards military forces, these will not be much required,  as hinted in the French note,  to protect the Armenians from each other.  If, moreover,  as suggested in the penultimate paragraph of  that part of the   French  memorandum relating to Armenia, one great Power alone cannot supply all the men or officers required, the, Allies together should be able to provide a joint force, or at any rate inter-allied officers for the present Caucasian-Arme- nian  troops, who are no negligible factor. Alternatively,   the  task  of   helping Armenia with men and money might well be confided to the Council of the League of Nations, by whom the appeal for volun- tary   assistance  would  be made with  greater effect.    The  French   memorandum  further  alludes to the  future  of the Armenian  State, vis-a-vis of a resuscitated Russia.  There are indications that Russia is more  prepared to recognise the creation of an  independent Armenia than of any other  independent border State.    We agree that the  Trebizond  area can-  not be included in Armenia; and the de-  velopment of the Anatolian Railway and  Trans-Caucasian  Railway system should  take the place of the  lack of a port.  We  suggest, however, that a special conven-  tion, should  be made  between Georgia,  Azerbaijan   (and/or  Russia).  Persia,  Turkey and Armenia regarding freedom  of transit and regarding  the  establish-  ment of a free port at Batoum.

La realityet la  logique  laissent  loin le  revemegalomane   d&apos;une  grande   Armenieallant de Trebizonde a Alexandrette.  Pour  creer cette  Armenie  unie, dontla  moitie   (PArmenie   Turque)  n&apos;estencore qu&apos;une  conception  theorique,  ilfaudra  d&apos;abord  proteger  les  elementsarmeniens  de  1&apos;Armenie  russe  contreune  population Tartare ou Kurde treshostile,  puis  ramener  dans 1&apos;ArmenieTurque des quatre  points de la Turquieles  Armeniens  disperses et les  defendrecontre la population Kurdo-Turque  marquis&apos;est  partagee  les terres:  une  force  de20,000 hommes sera necessaire.

Mais  cette   solution  ne resiste pas a un  examen approfondi: dans le vilayet de Trebizonde F element Musulman  represente  80 pour cent par rapport aux  Grecs; le pays doit done rester turc, de 1&apos;avis meme des Grecs, qui redoutent des massacres; en outre, la con- stitution d&apos;une  voie  ferree Erzeroum- Trebizonde se  heurte en raison des seuils

No. 3.Second part of M. Berihelot&apos;s note of the ]2th December regarding Arab countries, with    comments of the Political Section of the British Peace Delegation (not communicated    to M. Berthelot).(Confidential.)  With  regard  to  the  northern  and eastern frontier of Palestine, the FrenchMemorandum apparently accepts a recti-fication  of  the  Sykes-Picot  frontier.(This line  runs from a point  south ofTyre, passes the northern end of  the sea of Galilee, and crosses the Yarmuk valleyto a point just  south of Deraa, and thenpasses in a north-easterly direction acrossthe desert.)  But the Memorandum protests against any extension of the northern frontier asfar as &quot;la banlieue de Damas&quot; or anycession of  the  Hauran  or  the &quot; fertileplains round the basaltic outcrop of theJebel Druz,&quot; or  of &quot;all the  waters of damascus.&quot;  This anxiety may perhaps be inspired by  the first line proposed bythe  British  Military  Authorities  last summer,  behind  which British troops were  to be withdrawn.   This line ranroughly from a  point  south of Sidon,      [18291(D.) Entente  franco-anglaise  avec  lee      Arabes (en Syrie, Palestine, Meso-      potamie et Arabie).  La question a ete si souvent discuteequ&apos;ilnJest pas utile d&apos;entrer aujourd5huidans tous ses  details.   Les bases essen-tielles en sont d&apos;ailleurs posees dans lesaccords entre Frangais et Anglais en 1912(Declaration   de Lord Grey)  et  1916(Lettres Convention Grey-Cambon), entreAnglais et Arabes en  1915 (Lettres sir h.  MacMahon et le  Roi Hussein, juilletet octobre 1915)  entre Frangais, Anglaiset Arabes  (Declaration du 11 novembre1918), a la Conference de la Paix (Reso-lution  du  Conseil  Supreme du 15  sep-tembre 1919),  enfin entre les Frangais  etles  Arabes (Accord  verbal de principeentre Faysal et M. Clemenceau).  En reality  pour  que  les   promessesfaites aux Arabes soient tenues et pourqu&apos;une entente  commune  et  viable  aveceux et  entre  Frangais et Anglais  soitpossible, il est indispensable que Faysal,qui a ete presente par le   Gouvernementanglais  a  la  Conference   de  la Paix  etaccepte  par celle-ci,  du consentement  dela  France,   comme   representant  desArabes, puisse  constituer un RoyaumeSyrien  homogene,   Le   Gouvernementfrangais,   tenant  compte  de  1&apos;interetcommun et du dedir  manifesto si souventet  si fortement par  le   Gouvernementanglais, s&apos;est decide&quot; a,  faire a, Faysal lessacrifices necessaires pour qu&apos;une ententeloyale et complete puisse s&apos;etablir.  Maisil ne peut faire seul toutes les concessions.Aussi  tient-il  fermement aux  pointssuivants:   les  limited fixeds  par  lesAccords  de 1916 seront   respectees,  letrace du chemin de  fer anglais Caiffa aBagdad  ne   saurait  etre releve  versDamas,  Palmyre, Deir el Zor et Mossoul,sinon il  n&apos;y aurait  plus  d&apos;Etat Syrienviable et independant sous mandat fran-gais et tout accord avec Faysal en  par-ticulier  serait rendu  impossible.    (Lespreventions de TEmir  arabe ytaient  bienplus considerables et de son cote il a faitde  grandes  concessions  sur  ses  revesprimitifs pour s&apos;assurer une r&amp;tlite solidedu  cote  frangais, en  ne cachant pas  qu&apos;ilse  propose egalement de revendiqueraupres  des Anglais pour la Palestine,Mossoul et le statut exact de la zone B.)  Pour arriver a une entente avec Faysal,la France a modifie  grandement ses  vues                               B
 round the Nahr Hasbani basin to Jebel Jenin, thence east of Rasheya to a point south-east of Hennon, and thence east past Jebel Manias to a  point about  40 miles south-east  of  Damascus,  thence north to a point about 40 miles due east of Damascus, and  thence  in a  north- easterly direction along the Jebel Wus- tani and across the desert so as to include Tadmor (Palmyra)  in  the  British zone. This line is in any case superseded by that proposed for British evacuation last Sep- tember,  which leaves the  coast  at the mouth of the Litani river, follows that river to its bend north, thence to Banias, the  Nahr  Mughaniye,  and the western edge of the Leja.   It is true that if the former line were made the permanent frontier the French would lose the Hauran and the Jebel Druz area, as they fear in their memorandum, unless the line, instead of being extended&apos; eastwards, were run due south from Leja to cut the Sykes-Picot line.   The following line, supported  by the Chief Political Officer at Cairo, satisfies Zionist aspirations  in  the  north, but is understood  to fall  somewhat short  of them on  the east.  . It runs  from the sea just north of  the Litani, and, following up and at some distance  from the right bank, crosses it  from west to  east about the Litani Gorges. . The boundary  thence runs so as to include those of the Hermon waters which flow  into  the  Litani  or Jordan basins, i.e., the whole of the Nahr Hashani basin and the towns of Flasbeya and Rasheya.   Thence it falls due south to the summit of Mount Hermon.  Thence it runs south-west of the head waters of the Nahr Mughaniye, just east  of the Wadi el-Rukhad, and, after crossing the Yarmuk  valley  about halfway between Deraa and Samakh, passes some 25 to 30 kilometres  west of the Hejaz railway; thence west  of  Amman   in a   south- westerly direction to the end of the Dead Sea.  It  will be seen that  as  regards the eastern frontier this line does not,  as the French fear,  include either the Hauranor Jebel Druz  in Palestine.  As regards the northern frontier, it does include thewhole Nahr Hasbani basin,  to which the French  will  doubtless  object,  as it  is essentially Arab nationalist  country, andbrings the Palestine frontier due east and almost north-east of Damascus.  It may at once be said that the economic  is the only really defensible and justifiable basis on  which the  British  proposals  for  a considerable rectification  of the  Sykes- Picot line in Palestine in favour of the Zionists  can  be founded  in negotiation with the French&apos;.  The Allied pledge of a. primitives.   Pour rester en plein accord avec   le   Gouvernement  anglais,  M. Clemenceau  est  dispose&quot;  egalement a se preter a ses vues et a faire des concessions sur FAccord de 1916 en ce qui concerne Mossoul et la Palestine, mais il ne peut, sans renoncer a, toute possibilite et a toute valeur  d&apos;un  mandat  syrien,  etendre les limites Nord de la Palestine, jusqu&apos;a la banlieue  de  Damas   au  benefice  des Sionistes, renoncer au Hauran et aux plaines fertiles qui dependent des coulees basaltiques du Djebel  Druz,  abandonner *uix colonies juives toutes les  eaux de Damas, accepter la modification de carac- tere politique du trace&quot; du chemin de fer anglais, renoncer non  seulement a Mos- soul (qui d&apos;ailleurs fait partie de la zone A. independante arabe et non de la zone bleu  ou  devait  seulement  s&apos;etendre d&apos;apres 1&apos;accord de 1916 1&apos;administration directe francaise fait  qui  est  relev6 specialement par Faysal) mais a, 1&apos;Hinter- land du mandat frangais  a  1&apos;Est  et au Nord.   Les  vues  francaises  sont  d&apos;ailleurs raisonnables  et conciliantes:  il est par- faitement possible d&apos;assurer aux colonies sionistes,  auxquelles   la  France   porte egalement beaucoup d&apos;int ret la disposi- tion d&apos;une  proportion importante des eaux des sources qu&apos;elles redlament, mais bien entendu sans abandonner la posses- sion territoriale qui causerait  un detri- ment capital  a, la Syrie et nous empeche- rait de nous accorder avec Faysal.   De meme  pour le trace du  chemin de fer, s&apos;il est reconnu neeessaire, d&apos;un com- mun accord, apres examen contradictoireet  pour des raisons techniques, d&apos;empieterlegerement sur  la zone A., un  droit de passage peut etre  concede, mais cela nepeut changer la souverainete territorialeni  aboutir a une modification politique duchemin de fer anglais, qui, de Caiffa a, Bagdad,  deviendrait un chemin de ferCaiffa-Damas-Mossoul, supprimant  enfait nos propres lignes et le mandat syrienfrangais.
national home  involves gradual jewish immigration into and colonisation of Palestine, and,  if the present native popu-lation is not to be abruptly dislodged, theterritory available for Jewish immigrantsmust be much developed and made as faras possible self-supporting.   The mili-tary and air arguments in favour  of theinclusion  of the greater part of MountHermon in Palestine  cut  both  ways,Mount Hermon dominating Damascus aswell as Northern Palestine.   Further,  itis difficult to discuss  a frontier with theFrench on purely military grounds, whenthe hostilites which are to test the fron-tier&apos;s efficacy  must  almost  certainly be between France and Great Britain.  Themilitary argument cannot therefore wellbe pressed.   The case for the eastern and northernfrontiers  outlined  above, however, ad-mittedly rests on economic grounds.   Asregards  the  eastern  frontier, the  Gazaand Beersheba district at present gives the  only good cereal-growing  area inPalestine.   The inclusion of the strip offertile territory east  of the Jordan butwest of the Hejaz Railway would supple-ment Palestine&apos;s deficiency in  this  re-spect.    The French  zone, on the otherhand,  will  include  the  fertile  Bekaavalley,  the Damascus plain,  and theHauran and Jebel Druz country, and willbe more than self-sufficing from the pointof view of cereals.   The  Zionist proposal for a northern frontier is designed to cover an extensivescheme of irrigation and electric powerdevelopment, - involving the carrying ofthe waters of  the Litani into  the NahrHasbani basin  and the conservation of allthe northern waters flowing from  MountHermon  into  the  Jordan and   Litanibasins.   The  economic argument for ithas already been developed above, and theFrench, who are equally pledged  to thepolicy of the national home, should find itdifficult to argue that Syria will suffer bythis scheme to an extent which would out-weigh the advantages to Palestine andZionism.   Economically  Syria  would hardly be effected by the realisation of theJewish scheme, and we do not agree withthe French Memorandum on this point.   On the other hand, we believe that the zionist aims in this direction can be sub-stantially met  if the frontier, instead of including the  whole  Litani  valley fromthe sea to the bend northwards, be madeto run more or  less from the present pointof departure  of the Sykes-Picot  line,north  of  Acre, north-eastwards so as toinclude in  Palestine the bend  of  theLitani itself and a  small portion of the  &apos; r- -   the north of the bend.   Thence it
might run due east to the southern slopesof Mount Hermon south of-Rasheya andcutting the Nahr Hasbani.  This latter suggestion, leaving to Syriathe coastal area north of Acre and roundTyre, and also the nationalist districts ofHasbeya and Rasheya, would be a veryfair compromise.  If such a territorial compromise should prove unattainable, the Zionist desideratamight conceivably be met by an economicagreement with  the  French,  which,  in-deed, the French Memorandum appearsto contemplate.    This,  however,  wouldnot  be  satisfactory.   It  is  doubtfulwhether  the French would or  could face the financial outlay involved by the highlytechnical plans already elaborated by the zionists.  In preference to a mere economic agree-ment we recommend that we should revert to the proposal for American arbitrationon the northern frontier  of  Palestinealready made last September.  If the French accept the modificationof the Sykes-Picot line described above inregard to the  northern and part of theeastern boundaries of Palestine, we do notthink we can press for any further modi-fication,  i.e., from the  point  south ofDeraa across the desert  to Abu  Kemal,more especially as the  French  appearfrom the Memorandum disposed  to cedeMosul on certain economic conditions. Itshould be added that there has been con-si considerable   local opinion on our side that ifthe line could not be deflected as far northas Rakka an  obvious  impossibility Abu Kemal would be more satisfactoryfor administrative reasons than any  in-termediate point.  With regard to the French disinclina-tion  to modify the trace of the  Haifa-Baghdad Railway by allowing us to runit as far  north as Deir es Zor, a survey isat present being made of the possibilityof construction entirely within our ownzone.  No report, however, can be ex-pected at present.   If no railway within our  zone is practicable, we  must,  ofcourse, insist on our rights under Article7 of the  Sykes-Picot agreement;  but wedo not think we can go further.  In regard to Mosul, we note that theFrench now ask, in return for the fulfil-ment of M. Clemenceau&apos;s promise to Mr.Lloyd George, an equal share in Kurdishand  Mesopotamian oil.  Under  the suspended Long-B^rengerarrangement the French  obtained 20 percent, interest in the new company, or 25per cent, if  the 10 per cent, allowed for local capital was not taken up.  There  are thus two points of differencebetween this arrangement and the present  Enfin la concession sur Mossoul, en ce qui touche la France, a pour contre-partieessentielle, reclamed  par  1&apos;industrie et leParlement frangais, la stricte egality dansFexploitation  des  paroles  de Medopo-tamie et du Kurdistan.

From the technical point of view it is difficult for us to express an opinionon our  respective needs and resources inthe  matter of oil.    From the political point of view we think there is a case fora certain measure of generosity to  theFrench in this  respect.&apos;    Anglo-Frenchfriendship and co-operation must be the foundation of the League of Nations andof British policy within any  measurableperiod.   The actual extent to which  the Frenchdemand can be met must be a matter ofbargaining; but  we suggest that a con-siderable  advance on the proportions ofthe  Long-Berenger arrangement mightbe made in return for the satisfaction ofour  desiderata  in  the  Arab countriesgenerally  and   in   particular  in  the arabian Peninsula.*   If, however, British  oil  requirementsmake it impossible to satisfy  the Frencheven at a lower figure than 50 per cent., asuggestion has been  made which mightinduce the French to waive or  lower their demands.   Briefly the suggestion is thatthe  line of division between  the Frenchand  British Arab zones under the Sykes-Picot agreement should be brought downso as to make the southern  frontier of theformer  coterminous  with the  northern frontier of the independent State of the hejaz.    The western  frontier of  theFrench Arab zone  would  thus be  theeastern frontier of Palestine down to theneighbourhood of Akaba.   Apart  from the  question  of  oil,  theadvantages of this suggestion  are :-   (a.) A lever for obtaining the desiredmodification of the Sykes-Picot line in re-gard to the northern frontier of Pales-tine.  (h.) The satisfaction, partial at  least,of Arab aspirations towards  unity, andas regards the frontiers of Palestine byeliminating the division of FeisaFs king-dom  into  British and French  spheres of influence.  The disadvantages, which seem to out-weigh the advantages, are: &apos;  (a.)  That  the  possibility  of  an all-British railway  and  pipe-line  linking  * These observations regarding Mesopotamiam oilare modified by subsequent arrangements between sir John Cadman and M. Berecger.
Mesopotamia and Palestine, and runningprobably entirely  in the  British  zone,would disappear.  (b.) That it would be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain in  practice ourdesideratum of  a  monopoly of  political influence in the Arabian Peninsula.  We note with satisfaction this condi-tional promise of  French support as re-gards Palestine.   There seems, however,no reason to apprehend  Italian claims inthis respect, especially if Italian deside-rata are satisfied in Anatolia and Africa.Nor would the internationalisation  ofPalestine seem at this stage a contingencyto be contemplated,  since the Zionists,who are primarily interested, are knownto be strongly opposed to it.   We  musthope that  close  Anglo-French co-opera-tion in the treatment of the Arab problem will suffice  to reassure the Arabs and tosatisfy their legitimate  aspirations. Forthe rest, we welcome an exchange of viewsregarding the new regime in Palestine.  We  were   already  aware  of  these schemes,  which strain both  imaginationand pocket.   It will suffice to comment on them when they are presented in a moreconcrete form.          E. G. FORBES ADAM.          ROBERT VANSITTART.  Foreign Office, December 18,1919.

Article 1.   Inasmuch as  the territorial  rearrangements pre-scribed by this Treaty will leave to the Turkish Stateonly a portion of the revenues of the former ottoman empire, and the Turkish State (in  addition to the pre-war debt of that Empire) has incurred obligations duringthe war both to its late allies and to its own subjects,and  must  meet the legitimate claims of  the  AlliedPowers:   The  Allied  and Associated  Powers,  recog-recognising that all  these obligations cannot be fulfilled, and desiring to afford some measure of relief and assistanceto the Turkish State,  have  agreed with the TurkishGovernment that  a  Financial  Commission shall  beappointed,  consisting of one  representative of each ofthe principal Allied Powers, viz., France, Great Britain,Italy  [and  the United  States  of America],  with thepowers and  duties set forth in the following article :                       Article &apos;2.   The Financial Commission shall take such steps asin its&apos; judgment  are best, adapted to  conserve  and increase the  resources of the  Turkish Government, andto this end shall have the power to veto all expenditure which it may  deem  to be  unnecessary or  inexpedient,and to propose such alteration in the fiscal system or such  increase  of taxation  as may appear  to  it  to  bedesirable.  &apos; Accordingly the Budget to be. presented  annually bythe Turkish Minister of  Finance  to  the  Chamber of deputies shall  be submitted, in the  first instance, to theFinancial Commission, and shall be presented  to theChamber in the form approved by that Commission.                      Article 3.   Having;  thus provided  for defraying the necessaryexpenses of  the administration of the State, the FinancialCommission shall, at  its discretion, deal with any surplusof revenue over expenditure in the following manner ::     (i.) The  first  charge  shall  be  the salaries and          current expenses  of  the  Financial Commis-          sion and  the cost  of the Allied military and          naval forces of  occupation from the date of          the Armistice to the date of the ratification          of  this  Treaty,  and&apos;, should  such occupa-          tion  continue  thereafter, the  cost  of the          forces so  employed.   The  amount of  this          charge, and  the annuity  by which it shall          be  payable,  and the  period for which the          annuity shall run, shall, be determined  by the          Commission.    (ii.). The second charge shall be  the annuity payable          by the Turkish Government for the service of          the pre-war Debt of  the  Ottoman  Empire as          hereinafter -prescribed.   (See Article 14.)
    (iii.) The Financial Commission shall, determine the           amount  of-the annuity  which the  Turkish           Government shall pay towards the  claims of           the Allied Powers  for reparation for action           taken during  the war, due regard being had           to  the. financial condition  of the  Turkish           State, and the necessity for  providing  for           the essential expenses of its administration.             This annuity, the currency of which shall           also  be, determined, by  the  Financial  Corn-           mission, shall  constitute the third charge           upon the resources of the Turkish State.    (iv.) Fourthly, in order of priority, the  Financial           Commission shall have power to expend such           sums as they may  deem to  he necessary  in           order to rehabilitate or stabilise the  value of           the currency notes issued  by the  Turkish           Government during  the period of hostilities.    (v.) Fifthly, the  Financial Commission  shall have           power to pay such sums as may appear to be           equitable   in  respect of  the  obligations (in-:           eluding the internal debt) contracted by the           Turkish  Government  towards  its   nationals           during the war.   Any hypothecation   of           Turkish  revenues  effected  during  the war           in  respect of  such  obligations  is hereby           annulled.    (vi.) The Financial Commission  shall determine  the           amount of the  claims of the  German and           Austrian Governments to repayment in respect           of  loans and advances made to the Ottoman           Government during  the  war, which claims           have been  transferred  to   the  Allied  and           Associated Powers under Articles 2(31 and 213           of  the Treaties with  Germany and Austria           respectively.  These claims shall  rank last,           among the obligations of the Turkish State,           and no sums  shall  be paid on this account           until in the opinion of the  Financial  Corn-           mission the obligations above mentioned have           been fully satisfied.                  .    Article 4.    No new concession shall he granted by the  TurkishGovernment either to  a subject of the  Turkish State.orotherwise save upon  such  conditions as the  Financial,Commission may approve, having regard to the  necessityfor developing the resources of the country in the interestof the Turkish people.                      Article 5.    The  investment  of foreign capital in the Turkish&apos;State being essential for  the purpose of developing theresources of  the country and  enabling it to  bear the burdens resulting from  the war, the Turkish Govern-ment, realising that the establishment of the  FinancialCommission will not by itself secure the reforms neces-sary to  restore the prosperity of the country, agrees toappoint administrators of foreign nationality to fill theposition of -Director of Customs, Director of the Depart-ment of Internal Revenue, Director  of  Posts and Tele-graphs, Director of the Audit and Establishment Office,and Director of the Mint.    [1866]                                   B 2
     These  administrators  will  be  appointed  by  the  Turkish Government on the nomination of the Financial  Commission  and will not be removable except with  the  consent  of the Commission, and they shah  have  power  to suspend or dismiss from their positions  any officials  whom they deem to be unfit  to discharge  their  duties  efficiently.                       Article 6.     The Turkish Government agrees to adopt and  follow  the advice of the administrators appointed under  the  preceding  article  in all  matters  falling within  their  competence.   In  case  of  any difference  of  opinion  between the  Financial Commission, and any  foreign  administrator, the views of the Financial Commission  shall prevail.                       Article 7.    The powers and duties of the foreign administrators  mentioned above, and  of any  other administrators who  may be appointed, will be defined in the firmans creating  their offices respectively.                       Article 8.    The High Contracting Parties agree that, so long as  the provisions of this chapter  are scrupulously  fulfilled  by the Turkish Government, they will not prohibit the floating of loans on  behalf of  the Government  in  their respective countries nor take any measures for preventing financial participation by their nationals in the develop- ment of the Turkish  State.  -                       Article. 9.    The High Contracting Parties agree that Powers to which  Turkish territory is  or  has  been ceded, by. the arrangements concluded after the Balkan War or the present war, shall participate in the annual charge for the  service of  the  Ottoman  Public Debt   contracted before  the outbreak of the present war.                      Article 10.    For the purposes  of this chapter, the Ottoman Public Debt shall  be deemed to consist of  the  Debt heretofore governed by  the Decree of Mouharrem, together with such other loans as are enumerated in the  first Annex to this  chapter.         ,                      Article 11.    The general principle to be followed. in determining the amount of the annuity to be paid by each Power, to which Turkish territory is or has been ceded, is that the amount shall bear the same ratio to the total required for the service of the Debt as the average revenue of the ceded territory bore to the average revenue of the  whole Empire (including in each case the yield of the Customs surtax  imposed in the year 1907) over the three financial years 1909-10, 1910-11, and 1911-12.                      Article 12.            ,    The Financial Commission shall, as soon as may  be-after the ratification of this Treaty, determine in accord- ance with  the principle mentioned in  article 11 the
                           &apos;5 I amount of the  annuities  referred  to  in that article. The decisions of the Commission shall be communicated to the  High  Contracting Parties  at the  earliest  date possible  after the coming  into  effect  of the  present Treaty.                      Article 13.    The annuities assessed in the manner above provided will be payable  as from the date of the ratification of this Treaty, and  shall continue  to be payable (except as provided  below by Article 20) until the  final liquidation of the  Debt,   They  shall,  however, be proportionately reduced as the loans constituting the Debt are succes- sively extinguished.                      Article 14.    The Financial. Commission shall likewise determine, in accordance with the principle prescribed in Article 11, the annuity payable  by the Turkish  Government  in respect of  territory  remaining  to the  Turkish State towards the service of the  Ottoman Public Debt.  This annuity shall constitute  a  charge  upon  the whole resources  of  the Turkish  State,  subject  only  to  the priority established by Article 3 of the  charges  for the maintenance of the Allied forces of occupation.   -In  consideration of the  acceptance by the Turkish Government of this general charge, the specific hypotheca- tion of particular revenues towards the service of particu- lar loans in virtue of  the Decree of Mouharrem, and  the contracts for loans subsequent to  that Decree, shall  be annulled from  the date at which  the liabilities  of  the Council of the Debt are transferred  to the Caisse de la Dette, as provided in  the following article.                      Article 15.    Known  as  the   &quot; Caisse de  la  Dette   publique ottomane,&quot; a Commission shall be established consisting of four  commissioners to be appointed by France, Great Britain, Italy,  and the Turkish State, the sole function of which will be  to  provide for the service of the Ottoman Public  Debt as herein defined.    As  from such  date as may be  prescribed  by the Financial Commission, being not later  than one year from  the ratification  of  this Treaty, the Caisse  will receive  the annuities  (or the capital sums representing such annuities) to be paid for the service  of the Ottoman Public  Debt  in  accordance with  the present Treaty, and will take over the liabilities of the  Council  of  the Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt.    From the same date all the powers and duties of  the Council of the Debt,  other  than  those hereby assigned to  the  Caisse de la  Dette, shall  be assigned by  the Financial Commission to such department of the Turkish Government as the Commission may deem most  appro- priate.  Such  officials of the Council of the Debt as  the Commission may determine shall be transferred together with the duties in question.                      Article 16.    The  Caisse will apply the annuities hereby placed at its disposal in the following manner, viz. :-   It shall apply annually the sum of   T. 2,157,375 in payment  of  interest  upon the  Unified. Debt  and    [1866]            ,                      B3
  amortisation of the Unified Debt and the Lots  Turcs  respectively, in the manner prescribed by the Decree of  Mouharrem and the decrees  annexed thereto, until the  extinction of that Debt.     It shall apply the residue of the sum of the annuities  to be paid under this treaty towards payment of interest  upon  and amortisation  of the other portions  of the  Ottoman Public Debt  as hereinafter  defined,  and  in  discharge of the necessary expenses of the administration  of the Caisse.                       Article 17.     All property, movable and immovable, belonging to  the  Administration  of  the  Ottoman  Debt,  wherever  situate, is transferred to the Caisse de la Dette, and will  remain integrally at the disposal of that body.   In the  same  manner  the  reserve funds and the  investments  representing the Tripoli indemnity pass integrally to the  Caisse de la Dette.  :   The  Caisse shall have power to apply the  value of  any  realised  property, and the reserve funds of  the  Ottoman  Debt, and  the investments representing  the  Tripoli  indemnity,  for  the purpose  of  extraordinary  amortisation either of the Unified  Debt or of the Lots* Turcs, or  for the purpose  of  meeting any arrears of  interest on the Debt at its discretion.                      Article 18.    A sum equal to the arrears of any revenues heretofore  affected  to the  service  of the Ottoman Public  Debt within  the territories   that  remain  subject  to  the Dominion of the Turkish  State, which should have been  but have not been paid to the Council of the Debt, shall, except where such  territories have been in the military occupation of  hostile forces, be accounted for and paid to the Caisse de la Dette by the  Turkish Government so soon as in the opinion of the Financial Commission the financial condition of the country shall permit.                      Article 19.  .  The  Caisse  de  la  Dette  shall  creview  all  the transactions of the Council of the Administration of the Ottoman Debt which have taken place during the war, and any disbursements  made by the Council which are not in accordance with, its powers and duties, as defined by the Decree  of Mouharrem or otherwise before the war, shall be reimbursed to the Caisse by the Turkish Government so soon  as in the  opinion  of  the Financial Commission such payment is  possible.   The  Caisse shall have power to review  any action on the part of the Council of the Administration of the Ottoman Debt during the war which in its  opinion  is prejudicial to the interests of  the bondholders,  and  to  annul  any obligation entered into by the  Council which was not in accordance with its powers as defined above.                     [Article 20.    Any  of the  Powers  who by  this  Treaty  are  to contribute to the  annual charge for  the service  of the Ottoman Public  Debt may, upon giving six months&apos; notice to the Caisse de la  Dette, redeem such obligation
  by payment of a sum representing the value of such.  annuity capitalised at such rate of interest as may be  agreed between the Power concerned and the Caisse.     The Caisse  shall not have  power to require such  redemption.                       Article 21.     Upon the final  extinction of  the  Ottoman Public  Debt all money and securities and all property of any  kind belonging to the  Caisse shall be transferred to and  become the absolute property of the Turkish Govern-  ment, and thereupon the Caisse shall determine.                       Article 22.     The High Contracting Parties approve the regulations  for the Caisse de la Dette set forth in Annex II to this  chapter.                       Article 23.     The sums in gold&apos;to be transferred to the Allied and  Associated Powers by Germany and Austria under the  provisions of Article 259 (1) and (2), and (4) and (7) of  the Treaty with Germany, and under Article  210 (1) of  the Treaty with Austria, shall be placed at the disposal  of the  Financial  Commission, and applied  by them in  satisfaction of the claims of the Allied Powers against  the   Turkish  Government,  subject  to  the  priority  established by Article 3 of the chapter of this Treaty.                       Article 24.     The sums to be transferred by Germany in accordance  with  Article 259 (3)  of the Treaty of Versailles, shall be  placed  forthwith  at the  disposal of  the Caisse  de la  Dette.                     Article 25.     The Turkish Government  agrees with  the  Allied  Powers that the German Government  is hereby released  from the obligation incurred  by the latter  Government  during the war to accept Turkish Government  currency-  notes  at a specified rate of exchange in payment for  goods to be exported to Turkey from Germany after the  war.                      Article 26.     The High Contracting Parties agree that, so soon as  their claims against the Turkish  Government  as  estab-  lished in this chapter of this Treaty have been satisfied,  and the pre-War Debt of the Ottoman Empire has been  liquidated, the  Financial  Commission shall determine.  The Turkish Government shall then consider in con-  sultation with the Council  of the League  of Nations  whether any further administrative advice and assistance  should in the interests of Turkey be  provided for the  Turkish Government by  the  Powers,  members of the  League of Nations, and, if so, in what form  such advice  and assistance shall be given.                    ,                      Article 27.    The legislative measures required in order to give  effect to the provisions of  this chapter will  be enacted  by the Turkish Government and by the Powers concerned
without delay.  The High Contracting Parties assent tothe repeal  of the. Decree of the 8th/2Gth  December,1881, and the Decrees, annexed thereto of the lst/14thSeptember, 1903,  and of the 21st May/4th June,&apos;1911,on  the coming  into force  of a new Decree givingfull effect to the provisions of this chapter.

The  final  arrangementsfor the territories ceded  by Turkey must be the subject of  subsequent  negotiationamong  the Allies themselves.   The outlines of  such a  preliminary settlement are drawn below on  a geographical basis from west to east, together with suggestions forthe administration and financial regime  of the zone of Constantinople and the starits and of the future Turkish State.   The principle  underlying the territorial  proposals isthat the settlement should be a national and not a  religious one.               Constantinople, the Straits, and the Sea of Marmara.     Constantinople and a strip of  European  Turkey should  be ceded to the Allied andAssociated Powers and administered as an autonomous zone by the League of Nationsacting through an  international  commission.   The functions  and composition of thelatter will be dealt with below.Territorial Limits.     The  extent  of the  zone should be as follows: European Turkey, south of theEnos-Midia line.   It should include in its jurisdiction the Dardanelles, Bosphorus, andthe Sea of Marmara, and  the waters within  3  miles of the Mediterranean mouth ofthe Dardanelles  and  the Black Sea mouth of the Bosphorus.  It should  include allislands in the Sea of Marmara and all territorial waters in the Sea and Straits and the islands  of Tenedos  and  Imbros.   The  line  of demarcation between  the internationalzone and the Turkish State in  Anatolia  should be  the Asiatic  coast,  as the settlement is thus likely to be rendered  more acceptable to Moslem feeling, apart from the factthat the  inclusion of the  Asiatic  shore would  cut off the  interior  from  its naturaloutlets, e.g., Panderma and Mudania.  It may, however, be necessary, for  commercialreasons, to include the Ismid Peninsula  up to the  Shile-Ghebse line, as  the  economic life of the two sides of the Bosphorus largely  interpenetrate  and  the  line forms  a convenient geographical frontier.
Defence.     The  International  Commission  should  organise  a local  gendarmerie  for  the preservation of internal  peace  and order, and should station such Allied military forces in  the  zone as may lie required  for  the  protection of the territorial frontiers.   The Commission  should  also  organise  a  local  naval  force for policing  the  waters in the zone.     A  mixed  military  and naval  commission should  also be  appointed  under  the Treaty  of Peace to  consider and recommend to the Allies what military and naval fortifications shall be maintained and  transferred to the Commission on the European shore of the Dardanelles and  Bosphorus and Sea of Mamara with a view  to safeguard freedom of navigation through the  Straits in  peace and war.  All fortifications, other than those which  the Commission  shall decide to be necessary for the above purposes, shall be demolished.     No.fortifications shall be allowed on the Asiatic shore, and a strip of territory some 15  or 20  miles in depth, extending from a point opposite Tenedos to Shile  on the Black Sea, should be demilitarised.  The  Commission should  have landing rights  on  the Asiatic  shore to ensure the observance of the above stipulations. Composition of the Commission.     The  Commission  should be composed of  representatives of France, Great Britain, and Italy, and eventually  of  Kussia, and also of America if she agrees to participate. These representatives might be appointed by the Council of the League of Nations. Representatives of other interested countries (Germans, Turks, Greeks, Rumanians,  and Bulgarians) will have to  be included  eventually.  The Council of  the  League of Nations shall  decide at  what moment this measure  can  opportunely be carried into effect. Presumably Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey can only be represented when  they  become members  of the  League of Nations;  but the early inclusion of Turkish representation will be  desirable with a view to conciliating Moslem opinion.  It might be  necessary to ensure  that the real voting power is in the hands of the  principal Allied and Associated Powers.  The chairmanship of the  Commission might either be offered permanently tothe American member or be rotatory.    The  Commission  would have legislative authority and the executive would consistof the necessary departments (Interior, Justice, Defence, Public Health and Instruction, Finance and Customs, Public Works, Commerce and Navigation,  Posts and Telegraphs, Evkaf).    These would be staffed by natives in all the subordinate positions and consist&apos;largely  of foreigners, chosen  irrespective  of  nationality,  in the  higher ones.   Allappointments  would  be  made  by the Commission.  Representation of the governed inthe matter  of legislation is an eventual  necessity.   The preferable and indeed the only practical, course, however, is that this should be elaborated by the Commission after full consultation with the inhabitants of the zone.Functions of the Commission.    The Commission should be charged with maintaining the freedom of navigationthrough the Dardanelles, Sea  of  Marmara,  and Bosphorus  in peace and  war,  and inparticular with the following functions relating to the navigation  and quarantine of the,Straits :     (a.) The execution of any  works considered necessary for the improvement of the           channels or the approaches to harbours, docks, or quays.    (6.) The lighting and buoying of the channels.    . (c.) The control of pilotage and towage.    (d.) The control of anchorages.    (e.) The control of docks,  quays, and  harbours, and the provision of  such further           docks and quays as may  be required.    (/.) The control of all matters relating to wrecks and the salvage of vessels injured           by collision, stranding, or other reason.    (g.) The control  of  the loading and discharging  of cargoes, whether to or from           lighters or other craft, or to or  from the quays or shore.                  1    (k.) The control of quarantine and all sanitary matters,  including the health of           shipping in the port.    The  Commission should have power to  levy dues solely for the purpose of  paying the expenses of policing the waters of the zone and for carrying out the above functions/
 Any surplus receipt over and above a reasonable reserve fund might be employed  for general administrative purposes.   The agreement of all Powers whose vessels use these waters would have to be obtained for this.   It might be secured on the ground that the interests of all nations alike are  involved in keeping the Straits open, and this is the primary purpose of the establishment of the international State.     The Commission should have power to determine the amount of fines  for  infringe- ment of the regulations made by it in regard to the navigation  and  quarantine of the waters of the zone, but all dues, charges, and lines imposed by the Commission in regard to navigation and  quarantine should be levied impartially  and equitably in respect of all vessels,  whatever be  their port  of  origin, destination,  and departure, their  flag or ownership, or the  nationality or ownership of their cargoes.     The right of  navigation through the Straits which will be  conferred on  ships of war by the Treaty being intended only to confer a right of passage, such vessels should conform their movements in all respects to the regulations  issued  by the Commission. Any vessel of war  intending to  pass the Straits should notify the Commission and should comply with such  directions as  may be given.     The chapter of the Treaty dealing with  the zone  of the Straits will presumably also contain clauses similar to those  generally adopted  for  the rest  of the territories ceded by Turkey,  relating to      l.  Capitulations and judicial regime and extradition  treaties;     2.  Administration of Wakfs ;     3.  Freedom of conscience and religious toleration ; r     4.  Missionaries and missionary schools ;     5.  Freedom of trade ;     6.  Concessions;     7.  Adherence to International Conventions;     8.  Archaeology and archaeological research. Finance.     In considering the financial situation of the international zone, it will  be  necessary to estimate not only the extent to which the administiation  can be made to pay its own way, but also whether and how far a  surplus revenue can  be  found to meet that portion of the pre-war Public Debt of the Ottoman Empire which will fall as a  burden on the zone as on the other territories ceded by Turkey.     The following are the principal sources of revenue :-     (a.) Shipping and Quarantine. Reference has already been made to the possibility of devoting the  surplus  of the dues, charges, and  fines, over  and  above the current expenses of the navigation and quarantine services, to the general administration.     (b.) Land Customs. Owing to the present state of trade and communications, the zone will  be temporarily unable  to pay for  its necessary&apos; imports, and the immediate revenue to be looked for from this source must necessarily be slender.     (c.)  Fisheries. The revenue from this industry, which  has  fallen during the last ten years, is earmarked for the  service of the  Public Debt.  The industry, however, can be largely developed and if, as is  proposed, the various territories ceded by Turkey are assessed for a  lump sum.to  be raised as each administration  finds convenient, there should&apos; be, a considerable surplus for the purpose of general administration.     (d.) Internal  Taxation.-The yield from this  source cannot be estimated on the existing basis.  The figures for  the past have been whittled by peculation and would be correspondingly increased by honest administration.     (e.)  Mineral Deposits. There is copper  at  Saryar on  the  Bosphorus, which has hitherto only not  been worked  owing to the obstruction of the Turkish War Office. There  is exceedingly valuable  marble in the island of Marmara.    Coal is  mined at Keshan, where British capital is invested ;  and the Standard  Oil Company and the Staua Romana have concessionary rights over 35,000 acres  in the Gallipoli Peninsula (kaza of Charkeui).    The new factor of honesty applies equally to  all sources of revenue.  Once theadministration becomes honest and efficient, if security is assured,  and  if communications are improved, population and trade will alike  increase.  For instance, the  developmentof market-gardening, which has already proved its possibilities, will go far to  decreasethe need for importing - foodstuffs, the promotion of the  milling industry will cheapenthe price of cereals to the consumer, the natural attraction of Constantinople to visitors
can be enormously enhanced, and such places as Shile) are already ripe for development.aspleasure and health resorts.   This, perhaps, is a further argument for including Shile inthe zone.     The size of the zone will naturally limit the growth of native industries, but, as a porton an important trade route, Constantinople offers still wider possibilities of commercialexpansion, and hence revenue.  Potentially it is already a distributing centre  for thewhole of Black Sea littoral, a good part of  Bulgaria up to  Philippopolis, and for thevilayets  of  Brusa, Angora,  and  Castamuni  in  Anatolia.   In practice, security and improved communications might make it a flourishing centre&apos;not only for this trade, butalso for that of Southern Russia, the Caucasus, Armenia, and  Persia.   For this purposeConstantinople should be made a free port and a bonded-warehouse  system introduced,the quay services being  prolonged down the  Sea of Marmara to  Koum Kapou.   this development would naturally fall to  be  undertaken by  the Constantinople  QuayCompany, in which British capital is largely  interested.  The bonded-warehouse system should afford all necessary facilities for manipulating goods, and the duties levied on thegoods as withdrawn and exported should form  a  substantial part of the revenues ofthe zone.     The establishment of the free port,  as in  the case of Hamburg, would in turn tendto promote manufactures and the  creation of factories, and would in  any case  attractvisitors and customers from all over the Near East, increasing the taxable wealth of thecommunity.   Lastly,  a further  logical development  would  be the creation  of animportant coaling  and bunkering station for  the growing number of  ships, which theincreased efficiency of the administration of the&apos;port would draw through the Straits.     Constantinople can therefore, according  to  the  policy adopted, be  made  either abackwater or an emporium;  but  the latter policy  can, of course, only be contemplatedon condition that the Sultan  and  his Government are expelled.     The  expulsion of the  Sultan, however, gives rise to this consideration.  It would naturally imply the transfer  of. all the governmental  machinery of  the  old  Turkishcapital.   It might, however, be difficult to accommodate it at once  in such a  place asBrusa or Konieh.   Immediate expulsion of all Turkish officials and their families wouldresult in great hardship to  a large number of people.   It may therefore be necessary to execute the transfer apart from  that of the Sultan-gradually.   Possibly the  Caissede la Dette might be retained at Constantinople  for the time  being.     The current expenses of  the  administrative  services for  so small an area shouldnot be high, and in a short time,  if the above forecast  prove  accurate, the  zone mightbe able to cover  expenses from its own revenues,  and perhaps even to  meet its allottedportion of the pre-war  Ottoman Debt service.   Meanwhile, it will be for the French,British, and Italian Governments to consider whether they are prepared to advance tothe zone a sum of money to cover the immediate deficit between  the  annual budget ofthe zone and the total required to pay the expenses  and the debt service, or whetherit may not  be possible  to relieve  the zone of the payment of the  debt service  for anumber of years and recoup the bondholders from other sources.  The former alternativemay not find favour with the British Treasury, who would anyhow have to be consulted before such  a hope could be held  out.   Some sacrifice is inevitable if we are to securethe political advantages anticipated from the  foundation of the International State.                          Rest of European Turkey.     If the international zone of Constantinople and the Straits be established, the restof European Turkey up to  the Enos-Midia line might be ceded to Greece,  with frontierrectifications in favour of Bulgaria in the north and some special stipulations regardingBulgarian commercial privileges at Dedeagatch.  It is felt, however, that the settlementof this area  is largely dependent on that of the Smyrna area (see immediately following paragraph).Smyrna  Area.     It is understood that the Supreme Council  is to some extent  committed to thecontinuance of the Greek occupation, and at any rate this occupation has been prolongedover such a period  that a Greek  evacuation  at this  stage can  hardly be decided uponwithout  considering the  possible  political   effect  not only on  the  present  GreekGovernment but also on the  nationalist movement in  Turkey.  Our  view is, therefore,that  a zone round Smyrna,  comprising more or  less the present  line delimited as  a strategic frontier  by General Milnef but excluding Aidin,  may have to be ceded  to
Greece.  The  proposal  for Turkish  disarmament  and Allied  control  of  the Turkishgendarmerie should  diminish the  chances  of a continuance  of  the  present guerillawarfare on the frontier of the zone.  This cession  can, moreover, be justified, as far asthe sanjak&apos; of Smyrna is concerned, on a basis  of nationality (the Greeks being in amajority in the sanjak),  and  the extension from the  sanjak  to the present line ofoccupation on the  ground of  strategy.  If  this cession took  place, Greece  would of course  have to sign a treaty containing stringent  stipulations  regarding freedom ofcommerce and transit via Smyrna and fully protecting minority rights.    On the  other  hand, the  Smyrna, region is important as an  economic  outlet toAnatolia.   If, therefore, it  be decided as we propose, that European Turkey up to theEnos-Midia line should be ceded to  Greece, it should be possible  to arrange withM. Veniselos a compromise somewhat as follows.&apos; The Smyrna area should  be left undernominal Turkish sovereignty, with a vali chosen with the consent  of the Powers andacting in  council.   The  latter  would be composed of representatives  of  the principal allied and Associated Powers, with,  however, adequate representation of local interests(both  Greek  and Turkish).  This would reduce Turkish sovereignty  to  an  agreeablefiction and at the same time provide  proper safeguards for the non-Turkish elements.                                    Anatolia.Territorial Limits.    The western boundary of Anatolia  will depend on a  decision regarding the preceding paragraph : the northern boundary  will be the Black Sea, Bosphorus, Sea of Marmoraand Dardanelles; the southern boundary,  the  Mediterranean; the eastern  boundarymust  depend on decisions regarding  Georgia, Armenia,  Kurdistan, Mesopotamia, Syria,and Cilicia dealt with below.The Question of Control.     Anatolia within these boundaries will be  left  as a  nominally independent TurkishState with its  capital at Brusa  or Konieh,  preferably the  latter, in view of Brusa&apos;sproximity to the international zone.     While nominally independent the Government of the Sultan must be subordinate to  effective Allied control in all the departments of State,  in  the capital as well asthe provinces.   Experience has shown it illusory to suppose that anything short of such control can surmount Turkish incapacity and obstruction.  What is needed is a completehold  over the finances, the gendarmerie and police, especially the former, together withclose supervision of the Ministries of the Interior, Justice, Public Works,  Commerce,and Agriculture, especially the two first.      It should be at once pointed out how  transparent is the French suggestion thatthe above measure of control can be  exercised through finance alone.  It is sufficient todraw attention to the fact that the  situation created by Mustapha Kemal always hasbeen, and always would be, possible  under any  scheme of purely financial tutelage,which would, moreover, be stultified by any influx of German or Bolshevik money.  Oragain, is  it seriously suggested that massacres would be prevented by the mere  denialfrom headquarters  of money  to  purchase  arms?  It  is obvious that this proposal  isinspired by French designs upon financial hegemony  rather than by any concern for thewell-being of the population.      Although financial control is  therefore a part  and not the whole  solution, it  must admittedly, in the interest of bondholders and investors, be complete.  With this end in  view the following detailed suggestions are offered : Finance.      For the sake of convenience this question may be considered in three parts :       (a.)  The Ottoman Pre-War Public Debt.      (6.) Measures necessary to remedy the currency problem.      (c.)  Financial control generally. (a.) The Ottoman Pre-War Public Debt.      It is generally recognised that special arrangements will be necessary to provide for the service of the loans of the Ottoman Public Debt (all of which were issued before the outbreak of the present war), as the revenues assigned by the Turkish Government will  no longer be integrally at  its disposal.  For  this reason those Powers to which
 Turkish territory is  to  be, or has been, ceded,  whether or not on a mandatory footing, should, subject  to certain exceptions, participate  in the annual charge of the service of the debt.   For the purposes of the Treaty the Ottoman Public Debt may be regarded as consisting of the debt hitherto governed by the Decree of Mouharrem, together with certain other loans of the Turkish Government.     The general principle; to be followed in determining the amount of the annuity to be paid to each  Power  to  which Turkish territory is ceded, will be that the amount shall bear the same  ratio t:o  the  total required  for the  service of the debt as the average revenue of the ceded territory bore to the average revenue of the whole Turkish Empire (including in  each case thp yield of the Customs Sur-tax imposed in the year 1907), for the three financial years 1909-10, 1910-11, and 1911-12.     For the  purpose  of fixing  the  amount  of  the annuities it is proposed that  a Commission consisting of three members (British, French, Italian, and eventually an American  if the United States agree to,participate), should meet  immediately after the ratification of the  Treaty with  Turkey.   The  Commission  would report their conclusions within a given period to the Allied xAssociated Governments.  The annuities thus assessed would continue to be payable until the final liquidation of the debt.  They should,  however, be  proportionately reduced as  the  loans constituting the debt  are successively extinguished.  In  any case  the territories of  Serbia  and Montenegro, in view of their losses as regards  population and property since 1913, would not be burdened with any proportion  of the debt; similarly the  independent State of  the Hedjaz would be free from the burden of the debt  in view ,of the obligation imposed  on it by the necessity of keeping up  Moslem holy places.   Lastly, as suggested above, the zone of the Straits might be equally freed from the service  of the debt for a certain number of years.     It is proposed that the  former  Administration  of the Ottoman Debt should be remodelled  and a new Commission appointed consisting of, say, three Commissioners nominated by France, Great Britain, Italy (and eventually as above, the United States), to be known as the Caisse de la Dette publique ottomane.  The Caisse would receive the annuities (or the capital sums representing such annuities) to be paid for the service of the Ottoman Public Debt as  provided for above.  They would take over the assets and liabilities  of the  former Administration of  the Ottoman  Debt.  The Treaty shall provide that the funds at the disposal of  the Caisse shall be  applied in the following manner:      (i.) The sum of  T. 2,157,375 for payment of interest and amortisation of the           Unified Debt and  the Lots Turcs respectively, in the  manner prescribed by           the  Decree  of  Mouharrem and the  decrees  annexed thereto  until the           extinction of that debt;     (ii.) The residue of the sum of the  annuities to  be applied  to the payment of           interest  upon  amortisation of the  other  parts  of the  Ottoman  Public           Debt as  above defined, and in discharge of the necessary expenses of the           administration of the Caisse.     The Caisse should have  power to modify the conditions of all  loans (other thanthose  hitherto governed by  the Decree of Mouharrem)  as to  their currency and sinking funds and should have power to  consolidate and convert such loans, but in theevent  of such  consolidation  or  conversion  the  rate  of interest prescribed in therespective loan contracts should not be modified.     The Caisse should  also have  power  to apply the reserve funds of the OttomanDebt and the  investments representing the Tripoli Indemnity for  the  purpose of thepayment of the arrears of interest  and the  extraordinary  amortisation,  either  ofthe unified debt  or  the Lots Turcs, at  its  discretion.  All property, movable andimmovable, belonging  to the  Administration of the  Ottoman Debt, wherever  it is,would  be transferred to the  Caisse de la Dette and would  remain integrally at triedisposal of that  body.  Similarly, the  reserve funds and the  investments representing.the Tripoli  Indemnity would  pass integrally to the  Caisse.  All revenues  affected tothe service  of the  Ottoman Public Debt within  the  territories which  remain subjectto the  Turkish  Government, which should have been, but have not been,  paid into theCouncil of the Debt would, except where  such  territories have been in  the military occupation of hostile forces, be accounted  for and paid  to  the Caisse by the TurkishGovernment within one  year  from the enforcement of the  ratification of the  Treaty.The Caisse would  review all  transactions of  the Administration  of  the OttomanDebt which had taken  place  during  the war  and any disbursements made by theAdministration  contrary  to  its powers  and  duties,  as defined  by the  Decree of
Mouharrem  or otherwise  before the war, would be reimbursed to the  Caisse by  theTurkish Government forthwith.  The Caisse would have power  to  revise any actionon the part  of the Administration of the Debt during the war which,  in its opinion,was  prejudicial  to  the interests of  the bondholders, and  to cancel  any  obligationentered into by the Administration which was contrary to its powers as defined above.     Subject to the terms of any special agreement between the Governments concerned,payments of all coupons or interest accrued due  to bondholders of the Ottoman public debt, but not paid during the war, would be paid as soon as possible by the Caisse fromthe funds at its disposal.     Any of  the  Powers, who  would be  bound  by the  Treaty to  contribute  to  theannual charge for the service of the Ottoman Public Debt, might, on giving six months&apos;notice  to the Caisse, redeem such obligation by payment of a sum  representing  thecapital value of such annuity at a rate  of interest to be agreed upon  by the  Powerconcerned and the  Caisse, but the  latter would  not have  power  to require suchredemption.     Subject to the observations which follow on,the difficult question  as  to the priority of Turkish obligations, the Turkish Government would be compelled by the Treaty toagree to regard this annuity  as a  charge upon the  entire revenues of the turkish empire ; but, on the final extinction of the Ottoman Public Debt, all money and securitiesand all property of any kind belonging to the Caisse would be transferred  to the TurkishGovernment, and the Caisse would thereafter cease to function.     Such legislation as may be  required in order to  give effect  to  any of  the  aboveprovisions would be enacted by the Powers as soon as possible after the ratification ofthe Treaty, and the &quot;Powers would have to assent to the  repeal by the  Sultan  of  theDecree  of the 8th/20th December,  1881, and  the Decrees annexed thereto  of  thelst/l4th September, 1903, and  of the 21st/4th June,  1911, on the coming  into forceof a new decree giving full effect to the above provisions.     Regulations on the following lines would be approved by the Powers in the treaty for the working of the Caisse de la Dette :       1. The Commissioners shall hold office for  a period of five years,  and shall receive           each a salary of 2,000L per annum.   The Chairman shall  be entitled to a           sum of 1,0001 per annum as &quot; frais de representation.&quot;  ,      2. The Chairmanship of the Commission shall be held for the period of one year           alternately by the representatives of France and Great  Britain.  In the first           instance,  the  Chairmanship shall be held  by the  representative of that           country whose delegate would then be entitled to the  Chairmanship of  the           Council of the Administration of the Ottoman Debt.  In the  absence of the           Chairman, the Chairmanship shall devolve on the doyen of the Caisse.      3. The decisions of the Commission shall be taken by the vote of the majority,  and           three Commissioners shall form a quorum.   In the case  of  an equality of&apos;           votes, the Chairman shall  have a casting vote.      4. Except as herein provided, the Caisse shall decide its own procedure.      5. The seat of the Caisse, as  already suggested,  might remain  for  a time at           Constantinople.      6. The Caisse shall have power to appoint and  dismiss its  employes and to           determine the  conditions  of their employment, but the Caisse  shall take           into its employment so many of the  staff of -the Council as, in the judgment           of the Caisse, it is desirable for them to employ.      7. The services of all employes of the Council, other than those so retained by the           Caisse,  shall  be  dispensed with,  but  the Caisse shall  have  power to           compensate such  employes on an equitable  basis if  they  do not  secure           employment at a rate of  remuneration equivalent to that which  they have           hitherto  enjoyed, either by the Porte or by one or other  of  the  Powers to           whom Turkish territory is ceded.      8. The Caisse  shall have power  to  pay to all employes being subjects  of France,           Great Britain, or Italy, who were removed from their employment after the           outbreak  of hostilities, the remuneration which  they would have received           had they continued  to exercise their functions.                            ,      9. The Caisse shall have power to set up a pension fund for its employed     10. The Caisse  shall deal  with the  pension fund of the Council in the following           manner, viz.:                The assets of that  fund  shall  be distributed to  or for  the  benefits of           those who have contributed to it on an equitable basis.
                In so far as concerns those employes.of the Council whose services are            not retained by the Caisse, the share of the assets pertaining to them shall            be  realised  and  distributed.   Any  sums  so  paid shall  be  taken  into            consideration in fixing the compensation payable under Article 7 above.                In so far as concerns those employes of the Council whose services are            retained  by  the  Caisse, the  proportionate share  of the assets shall be            transferred to the pension fund of the Caisse for their benefit.      11. The Caisse  shall publish annually  accounts  of its operations, showing all            payments of interest on the Ottoman Public Debt and all amortisation of            capital,  and such other  information as may be of interest to the bond-            holders and to the  contributing Powers, together with a statement of its            administrative expenditure.      Reference  has  been made  on page  7 to the  difficult question of  the priority of Turkish obligations.      These should be classified as follows:       1. Payment for the maintenance of the Allied  Armies of Occupation.      2. Reparation to the Allied Governments and  their subjects.      3. The  Pre-War Public Debt.      4. War Debt contracted by the Porte towards (a) enemy Powers;. (6) Turkish            nationals.   This can hardly be allowed to rank.      The priority of these claims is likely to  provoke controversy, but  it is a  British interest to maintain the above order,  and as regards (1) and  (2) there is the precedent of the German Treaty. (b.) Measures necessary to remedy the Currency 1&apos;roblem.      In view of the hopeless economic and  financial situation of the Turkish Empire as a result of the war, it is considered that the Turkish Government cannot,  consistently with the complete discharge of  the liabilities incurred before the war, fulfil the obliga- tions contracted  during the war.   It is  therefore  proposed  that measures  on the following lines should be adopted for  reviewing and  modifying  the obligations  entered into  by the  Turkish  Government during the war,  and  for rehabilitating  the currency issued during the same period.      As provided already by the German and  Austrian  Treaties, the German and the former Austro-Hungarian Governments renounce in favour of the  Allied Governments all rights to payment or repayment by Turkey, and in particular any claims which may* arise, now&apos;  or  hereafter, from  the fulfilment of  undertakings made by Germany or Austria during the war to Turkey.                      x      In  return  for this waiver the Turkish  Government  would  release  the German Government from  its promise to accept Turkish paper  currency at  a specified rate of exchange in payment  of goods to be exported  from  Germany to Turkey after the war.      The obligation of the  German Government (embodied in  the  German Treasury bonds deposited by the German Government from time to time with the administra- tion  of the  Ottoman  Debt as security for successive issues -of Turkish paper  money) to send a sum  in  gold  annually  for  twelve years after  the  conclusion  of  peace  is provided for by the German Treaty.   These  gold  payments will be made  at intervals to be provided for by  the Turkish Treaty.      Such gold payments would have constituted advances from the German Govern- ment to the Turkish Government, and would have been subject to repayment, but the Allied  Powers  have the right  to  receive such sums for disposal by the Reparation Commission.      The value  of the currency notes issued  by the Turkish Government during the war has so seriously depreciated that  the Turkish Government should be bound by the Treaty to appoint a Board charged with the  duty of effecting the repayment of  these currency notes and controlling future issues of paper currency in Turkey.      This Board would be composed of three members appointed by the British, Italian, French  (and eventually as  above the  United  States) Governments respectively.  No member of the Board would be removed  except wfth  the consent  of the nominating Government.      The control of the Turkish Mint would be transferred to the Currency Board, including all questions regarding,the purchase of bullion and the minting-of coin.
    The Treaty would stipulate that the Sultan should enact the necessary decrees forthe above provisions, and that  such decrees could not be modified or repealed withoutthe consent of the British, French, and Italian (and United States) Governments.(c.) Financial control generally.    Proposals have been outlined above whereby, through the establishment of the newCaisse de la Dette, the interests of the bondholders in the pre-war Turkish Debt will be safeguarded.   The further proposal to create a Currency Board is equally in the interestsof the bondholders and of all future investors of capital in Turkey.  In the interests ofthe latter, and, indeed, in the general interests of Turkey and of all those countries who stand to gain by the exploitation and development of Turkey&apos;s natural resources,some further safeguards of the financial stability of the new Turkey will be required.    It is therefore proposed that the Treaty should stipulate that a Financial Com mi  -sion, with extensive powers, should be appointed, as well as administrators of foreignnationality  for  various  financial  departments, including  a Director of  Customs,Director of the Department of Internal Revenue, a Director of the Post Office, and a director of the Audit and Establishment Office.    The Financial Commission  and Administrators would be appointed by the Sultanon the nomination of the Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy (and the UnitedStates), and possibly Belgium,  and would only be removable with the consent of theGovernment  by whom they were nominated.    The Treaty would stipulate that the Turkish Government  should adopt and follow the advice of the Financial Commission in all matters  falling within its competence.    A report by the Financial Commission  and by the  Director  of the competentdepartment of the Ministry of Finance would accompany the draft of the annual budget for the new Turkey, when it is  submitted to the Chamber of Deputies by the Ministryof Finance ;  and a  similar report would accompany the draft of any  law submitted tothe Chamber affecting taxation  or involving expenditure.    The relations between the Financial Commission, the Caisse de la Dette publiqueottomane and  the  Ottoman Currency Board would be defined in  regulations to beprepared  by the Turkish  Government after  the  ratification of the Treaty.   these regulations would be communicated to  the Allied (and  Associated)  Governments andwould require their consent.    The Treaty might stipulate that so long as the provisions of the  Treaty relating toTurkish finance, as outlined above, are  scrupulously fulfilled by the Turkish Government,the Allied (and  Associated) Governments would not prohibit the floating  of loans onbehalf of the Turkish Government in their countries, or take any measures to preventfinancial participation of their nationals in the development of Turkey.Other Control.    While a very full financial  control would be secured by the proposals outlined above, it must be repeated that supervision by the Allies (France, Great  Britain, Italy,and possibly the United States of America) must be equally  organised for the  otherDepartments of State.  This supervision should carry with it the power to dictate theappointment and removal of functionaries, the power of independent inspection in theprovinces, and the power to initiate or amend legislation.    For gendarmerie the Macedonian model of 1909 might be followed, except  that instead of being only advisers and instructors the officers would in practice have power toenforce commands.  In the Ministries of the Interior, Justice, Commerce, and agriculture the Allied advisers should  combine the functions of Joint  Under-Secretary of state with those of Inspector-General and have sole power to select and dismiss the inspectoralstaff.   At the  Ministry of Public Works it would be preferable to  restrict the allied representatives  to the capacity of technical advisers, with a view to avoid favouritismand jealousy in the  matter of concessions.  The final decision  as to  concessions must rest with the Financial Commission.    The question of the administration of justice has already been considered at paris and by the Allied representatives at Constantinople.  There is  general agreement thatthe capitulations in their pre-war form must disappear.   The question of the regime to succeed them being, however, exceedingly complicated, there is equal  agreement that  aspecial commission  must be constituted under the  Treaty to  elaborate  the necessarydetails on the spot.
     The departmental control in the case of all Ministries other than those of Finance(and its subordinate  Departments) and Public Works may be devised  on alternativelines :      (a.) Each Department would be controlled by one Allied Power,  the division being           made by agreement among the Allies;     (b.) The  advisory staff of each Department should be  nominated, irrespective of           nationality, by agreement among, the  Allied Powers.(a) for practical reasons seems preferable.     The Sultan would be required by the Treaty to pass the necessary decrees to giveeffect to the above provisions regarding Allied control.     While all the executive departments would thus be effectively supervised by theAllies, the form of the Turkish constitution would not be modified by the  Treaty,  butthe Sultan would be required by its provisions to  introduce legislation giving the Alliedadvisers a right to initiate and amend the enactments of the Turkish Parliament.  Ifthe League of Nations becomes effective, it might even be possible  to  give the  League,which by Turkish eyes is  already regarded, it is understood,  as  something holy  andmagnificent, a reserved power to disallow  legislation which  is  reported  by the Alliedadviser or advisers in  control of the Department initiating it to be directed against the legitimate interests of any minority of the population.  This might be provided for in aspecial treaty  for the protection of minorities to be signed by the Turkish Government.Proposal regarding  Italian  Evacuation of Southern Anatolia.     It should be added that for any such general settlement as that proposed above itis essential that the present occupation of Southern Anatolia by Italian troops should bespeedily terminated.  It is understood, however,  that  a proposal is under considerationby His  Majesty&apos;s Government whereby priority in the grant of new concessions will be conceded to Italy in the southern half of the Turkish State, as defined by the Treaty, asimilar priority being  given to France in the northern half, and the exact limits of thetwo halves being left to the Italian and French Governments to decide.   This  proposalmiy,ht be used as a  lever, and  there have been indications  in  Paris  that the presentItalian Government would regard their claims under the Treaty of London as  satisfied by it, together with the cessions of territory to be made  by Great  Britain to  Italy in africa.   These latter  cessions should neither be defined in detail nor  completed except as part  of the  final settlement in Asia Minor.     With regard to France, her interests in the Near  East, apart from  the  Debt, are primarily those  of prestige and concessions.    The first should be satisfied by  theposition  which she  is  acquiring  in  Syria  and by  participation  in  the internationalgovernment of Constantinople and the international advice and assistance  to be givento the Turkish Government.     The second should be satisfied by the proposal regarding concessions.     Italy&apos;s susceptibilities in the matter of prestige, apart from her economic interests,should  equally be safeguarded by her participation  in the International  Governmentof Constantinople and the Straits, and of Turkey  proper.                                    Armenia.     It  is understood  that  owing  to Americas  present reluctance  to  participate inmandates, it is not considered possible to add any considerable part of Turkish Armeniato the Caucasian Republic of Erivan, but that it is proposed  to  recognise, subject toRussia&apos;s eventual  consent, the  independence of  the  latter  republic.   While  thematerial difficulties of the  situation are realised, it  is felt  that Armenia  has  a strong case before the Conference for the most generous possible treatment  by the Allies, andthat this case might be met by attaching to the Armenian Republic of  Erivan a stripof territory west  of the Turco-Persian frontier so as to include Mush and Bitlis, and.the area round Lake Van.   The precise boundaries of  this area might be examined byan expert Commission, if the principle be approved, but might run roughly as follows :-Olti, south-west to a point west of Erzeroum, thence south  south-east to Mush, thencesouth-east  to Bitlis,  thence  to  the Gilolakan  Dagh,  and thence  north-east to the,Persian  frontier.   This  solution would put  in  the  Armenian State  an area roundLake Van which before the war&quot;contained a solid  block of Armenians, aud the countrybetween Lake Van  and the  Russo-Turkish  frontier is  understood to  be  sparsely populated.  It should not therefore be  difficult to occupy this area, provided, however,.
                                        Usome Allied help, particularly that of officers, is given to the Armenian forces, and providedsome Allied advisory assistance is continued for a period to the Armenian State.   Apart.from any sentimental consideration it would be greatly  to British interests to interposesuch an  Armenian block between  the Turks  in Anatolia,  and the frontiers  of theRepublic of Azerbaijan, and of the Azerbaijan province of Persia.                            Georgia and Azerbaijan.    It is  assumed that while provisional  recognition of independence may be given toGeorgia and Azerbaijan,  their definite status must depend on the Russian issue.   In anycase, however, Lazistan (roughly comprised within the limits of the old Sanjak) mightbe united with  Georgia, AS its inhabitants  speak a Georgian dialect and are of the samestock as the Georgian-speaking Moslems of the Batoum province.                                    Kurdistan.    It is  considered that there should be  south of the  above-mentioned Armenian zonean  autonomous Kurdish  zone, in which Turkish sovereignty should obviously cease to run.  The eastern  boundary of this zone would  be the  Turco-Persian frontier ; thewestern  boundary would  run approximately south-west  of Mush  to  Diarbekir, but would depend on  the northern  and  eastern frontiers of  the French  mandatory zone(see below);  details would have to be drawn by an  expert commission.   The southernboundary and the  size of the zone  must  depend on a decision regarding the northern frontier   of  Mesopotamia, which,  in  turn, must  depend  on British  security  andadministrative  convenience.   It is understood that this question  has recently beendiscussed by the  Eastern Committee, and, as  far as we  are aware, the three  possiblefrontiers discussed are shown on the annexed map.&apos;:!:&quot;  It will be seen that the size of theautonomous Kurdish State must depend on the final choice among these frontiers, but after  the  experience of this war  the safety of the Nestorian colony (to whom the allies are under some obligation), oil the  upper  waters of  the Greater Zab, if included in an autonomous  Kurdish  area, would  be precarious. &apos; Some preference is therefore felt onthis score for the most northerly frontier.                                      Syria.     The  French are now in  occupation of a district beyond, the area inhabited by theArabs as far  north  as Marash, Aintab, Birejik, and  Urfa.  From past negotiations,regarding the  division between ihe French and British Arab zones, they apparentlyclaim territory as far east as the Khabur  River or  the desert to the east of it.  It ispresumed that in addition to their  Syrian mandate the French will desire to continuethe occupation of this  area, and  may possibly wish to include  the  fertile  country ofDiarbekir and the great copper mines at Arghana Maaden, which fell to them underthe Sykes-Picot Agreement, in this zone.  It is  impossible to define the southernfrontier of the Turkish Anatolian State in this area until  the precise desiderata of theFrench are known ; an approximate line is, however, dotted on the annexed  map.*   Inview of the  fact that this  area north of  the Arab zone  is  inhabited  by a  mixedpooulation of  Turks,  Kurds, Jacobite Assyrians, and Armenians, no great objection is seen  to  this territory remaining outside the  independent Turkey and under Frenchprotection.                                      Cilieia.     In  connection with the  preceding  paragraph it was  felt  that if the  French.remained in occupation of this racially mixed area  to  the north of Syria, they shouldnot have been  allowed to continue in possession of Cilicia, which, west of the Antitaurus(Giaour  Dagh), to a point  north  of pay as, should have  returned  to Turkey, sinceMersina affords at  present the natural economic port for the Cilician  Plain  and theKonieh area.     In view of the general tenure of M. Berthelot&apos;s memorandum of 12th December,which shows a marked advance towards  British views, it is  proposed  that this point should  not be  pressed.     In any case, if Armenia fails to secure the  area round Lake Van, it is a matter forconsideration  whether Cilicia should not be  ceded by  Turkey and occupied by theFrench on the  express condition that some kind of national home for Armenian refugeesshould be created there.                                    * Not annexed.
    No examination is made of the precise frontiers, and status of Mesopotamia, the syrian coastal area (including the Lebanon), the Arab State  in the interior, Palestine,the Hejaz, and the Arabian Peninsula, because it is felt that the most pressing need isto conclude peace with Turkey.  Such a peace will simply stipulate for the cession ofthese  Arab territories to the  Allied and  Associated Powers and their  subsequentdisposal can be regulated by agreement between the latter.

                        .              No. 6.       Memorandum by Political Section of British Peace Delegation on Arabia.(Confidential.)     IN preparing a statement on our policy in the  Arabian Peninsula we have  beenconfronted with the difficulty that no  definite  decision has  been taken on this point,and  most  of the correspondence dealing with it is now somewhat out of date.  Wethink  that  the  question  should   be considered  de novo, and offer  the following observations:      Everyone, we believe, is now agreed that we should not attempt to assert anything in the Treaty  indicative of a desire on  our part to establish a special  position for ourselves  in  the Kingdom of  the Hejaz.  In  the first  place, this cannot  be  doneconsistently  with the recognition  of  Hussein as an ally  and his admission as anindependent  ruler  both to  the  Peace  Conference  and the League  of Nations.Secondly,  as the India  Office  have pointed out, such  a  step might  give grave and unnecessary umbrage to  Moslem feeling generally.   Thirdly, from past correspondence,it seems clear that the French Government would ,not accept it.  In practice we think we could gain what  we  require  by  relying on the  prestige and  authority which wehave already acquired as compared with other foreign Powers.   It might suffice for theTreaty to  contain a general self-denying ordinance as regards political  influence onthe part of all the Powers.     As regards the  rest of the Arabian Peninsula  (to be  defined  by a  geographicalline), we should  still  aim at  a  recognition of our  predominant position  and of suchTreaties with Arab rulers as we desire  to maintain.  This would obviate any difficultyin regard to the 1913 (unratified) and  1914 (ratified) Treaties  with  Turkey in regardto Southern and Eastern Arabia.     This  predominant  position  would not of course involve  any obligation to defendone Arab chief against another  as  distinct from  external  aggression.  It would also not  preclude  the extension of the  Hejaz suzerainty or rule over such portions of therest  of the peninsula as might be willing to accept it.     We should in any case stipulate  that the islands of Jebel Teir, Centre  Peak ofthe Zebayir Group and Abu Ail in the Red Sea, and  Little Quoin Island at  the entrance to the Persian Gulf, should be ceded to Great Britain for the maintenance of the lights.Kamaran should also be  ceded to Great Britain for maintenance as a quarantine station.If the objections  of the other Powers to cession are insurmountable, we can fall back onthe inclusion of these islands within the zone of our predominance to be defined by theline  above  mentioned.     For the rest, as matters now stand, the following alternatives are open to us:      (a.) Completely independent and separate  treatment for  the purposes  of the           Treaty  of  Mesopotamia, the Syrian interior (i.e., Syria, excluding Palestine           and the coastal area as far  north  as the  Anti-Taurus), the Kingdom of the           Hejaz, and the  rest  of the Arabian Peninsula.   (In view of the known           tendencies of French and British policies in the  coastal  area and Palestine           respectively, the exclusion of these regions seems inevitable.)     (6.) The. recognition by the signatories of the  Turkish Treaty thai:, sympathising            with the idea of Arab unity,  they will conduct their  policy as regards the           Hejaz and the rest of the Arabian   Peninsula  (in the  latter           explained  above,  Great  Britain  alone would be concerned), and will           administer their mandates in the case of Syria (excluding again the coastal           area  and  Palestine)   and  Mesopotamia, with a view  to   an  eventual            independent union or confederation  of  these Arab countries,  if and  when            the inhabitants  clearly show both  their  desire  for  such  an union  or           confederation and their capacity for  carrying it into effect and maintaining           it.  This recognition  might  take  the  form  of  a general  provision or         .  preamble of  that part of the Treaty which applies to the Arab countries, as           defined above.  The Syrian  interior,  Mesopotamia,  the Hejaz,  and the           rest of the Arabian Peninsula would then be  dealt with  separately in the           chapters covered  by the  above preamble,  though these  chapters would           doubtless contain identic clauses on many matters.
     The advantages of (a) are that it squares with the actual trend of present policy and the facts of the  situation.  Whatever may have  been one&apos;s views as  to  the ultimate possibility  of  Arab unity, the principle of division of responsibilities between France - and Great  Britain kills it.   To such  division we  were  committed  by  the Sykes-Picot Agreement;  and the course of negotiations will drive us to recognise that agreement in however modified a form.  Whatever ostensible similarity of administra- tion may be imposed  by the terms  of the  Syrian and  Mesopotamian mandates, the innate differences between French and British colonial methods will be reflected in a widening difference  between the political growth of the  two Arab countries.  - It is certain  that there is  in  the French  mind no conception  of the policy which we are already  adopting in  India and to which we are feeling our way in Egypt.     An Arab Union within the British Empire, on a footing similar to  Egypt or India, is now impossible.     The advantages of (6) are :      1.  That it may contribute to reconcile the Moslem mind  to the  expulsion from            Constantinople, by showing that the Allies sympathise with the aspirations            of an important section of Moslem opinion.  We understand that this is the            reason for which the India Office  strongly favour this policy.     2.  If the French will accept this, it will facilitate their agreement  with Feisal and            the Nationalist movement  behind him.     3.  Such a Treaty pledge may help to keep alive the original idea underlying the            mandatory  system  by putting some  curb on France,  in  whose political            wisdom we have no confidence.     4.  It would also suit us if our policy was to restrict so far as possible  our commit-            ments in Mesopotamia.   For such an encouragement of Arab  Nationalism            must inevitably mean administering Mesopotamia on a loose rein.     The cardinal disadvantage of (6) is that it  will meet with the most  strenuousopposition from the  French.  They evidently believe  that  the  Nationalist difficultiesimpending for  us in Mesopotamia on the return of Feisal&apos;s Arab officers  will force us into an identic policy of absorption.     The second disadvantage is as follows :      We have explained above that such a recognition of Arab unity has already beenmade  almost meaningless by  the division  of Syria  and Mesopotamia between twomandatories.  It would, be quite meaningless  if Feisal&apos;s Syrian territory  is also similarlydivided.   This latter objection could only be obviated by making the southern frontier of the French (Syrian) area coterminus with the northern frontier of the Hejaz.  Butthis would mean:      I. An end of practical British hegemony in the Arabian Peninsula.     2. Hastening the perhaps inevitable transfer of the Arab  centre of gravity from           Mecca and Medina to Damascus, i.e., from a British to a French sphere.     3. Rendering impossible the construction of a Baghdad-Mediterranean railway and           pipeline within a British sphere.     From the material at our disposal it will not be difficult to draft the details of thechapter of the Treaty relating to the Arab countries;  but until  the question  of  policy,as between (a) or (o), is decided, we cannot proceed to cast its general form.     In view of French opposition,  solution (a) will  probably be the only practicable one ;and Arab unity, if the  movement has any real substance  or vitality, will  realise itselfirrespective  of any formal recognition of the principle in the Treaty.
