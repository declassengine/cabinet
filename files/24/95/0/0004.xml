I have the honour to submit the following report ona tour undertaken by Captain A.A. Illyne, a very reliable RassianOfficer attached to this Section, based oh particulars he hasfurnished me and as to the correctness of which I&apos;am satisfied,           1, SKAEghIM0SXa V DIqTETCT.(a)    The harvests in the localities  of Alexandrovsk andNovomoskovsk are fair - in places below the average,  forinstance in the region to the north of Novomoskovsk,,    Under theBolsheviks all work was carried out on communistic principles to &quot;which the peasant population is completely hostile andnegative in attitude owing to their strong ideas as to therights of ownership.   In places where landowners were not present after liberation from Bolshevik rule, the crops werereaped and brought in as directed by the local 2emstvos inaccordance with the regulations issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the A.jj\S.R.   Throughout thevhole district the grainhas been gathered and cartrid  to the hon  steads in the villages;despite the difficulties prevailing in various places inconnection with the desultory fighting with the roving bandsof. dispersed Bolsheviks, whose wanderings have necessitated the ,da spat oh of num&amp;arous small punitive expeditions.   Manyestates are intact and have not been pillaged, inter alia thoseof Major-General Iliashenko, C.N. Rodzianko, Count tfostitz andothers^
     itfo organisations exist for food distribution.   It isdifficult to create them, and Indeed they would serve no practical object owing to the widespread corruption of theminer officials in the towns and ziemstvos.   freedom of tradeand transport have had the effect of enabling foodstuffs tomove about unhindered, it is  true in haphazard fashion, butat prices far below those v*hich obtained under the Bolsheviks,bread for example costing 30 tiu.es less than it did.     Five pools of grain per destiatine are levied by theGovernment as a tax at a low fixed rate, and the stocks thuscreated are despatched to relieve the northern districts freed from Bolshevik rule.   The remaining grain goes to cover localrequirements, arid is handled by the local co-operatives underthe supervision of the Governor at arbitrary prices which areinflated by the      demand,;   (There is sufficient flour inthe district, price 100 rouble per pood of 36 English Ibo,.^as against 1,200 roubles j. er pood under the jolsheviks.  BREADcosts 3 roubles per front (under 1 lb*)  There is no TEA inany quantity, and it fetched up to  50 roubles per front whenobtainable in the sh-pe of very inferior surrogate.  SUGARis to be had at 25 roubles per front.    Good MEAT abounds at prices ranging from 15-20 roubles per front, while EGGS fetch15 roubles per ten*   BUTTER is easily attainable at 25 roubles- er front.                .  -(b)  Prices of products and cost of living are on the vholesomewhat lower than at Roatoff-on-Don, but about doublecompared with the Ekatarinodar..   Maaufactuered goods are scareand exceedingly dear.    The general impression created by aninspection and tour of the district is in general that richesand plenty abound in the hamlets and villages, particularly   regards wheat, cattle and poultry..(o)    Many Ekatsrrinoslav factories that were idle duringthe bolshevik occupation have staited up, but coal is lackingand the mines working in  dilatory fashion,.  However, cw ing
to the proaimity of the coal mines, industrial lifo is wakingup and some movements of coal from the mines are observable,$our coal trains were seen.proceeding&apos; to j^&amp;aterinoslav on the14th September,, and on the 2nd October six trains.   Labour isplentiful in Ekaterinoslav and costs half the amount of wages paid in Rostoff,   Boots, cost 100 roubles to be repaired asagainst 300 roubles in I-ostoff,(d)   Authority seems to be weak and lackadaisical, governors and district departmental chiefs lacking energy, for instance in the  Alexandrovsk region.  Governor S.S. Stchtetinin is however a good administrator and has displayed great energyin t ran squ 111 i zing the Ekaterinoslav Government (Goubernia)and clearing the country from the numerous roving armed bandsof Bolsheviks vho had the audacity on the 25th September toattack the train of the Commander of the V,A* Genera,  liai-Maierski.   The Governor, personally commanding the detachment,destroyed one such band at Grishino Station at the commencementof September.(e)  The peasant population is absolutely against Bolshevism,and their attitude to the Y.A. loyal and friendly.   this attitude is mainly owing to the looting and assasinationsperpetrated by the Bolsheviks vfoo deprived the poor of every-thing they had, unless these happened to be Jews.   The Jewishelements seem on the \&amp;ole to deplore the departure of theBolsheviks.   The peasants&apos; are looking forward to a solutionof the agricultural problem and land question, Vkloh they hope to see achieved immediately a stable government of UnitedRussia is set upcif)    Railway transport In the Elaterinoslav District hasundergone considerable improvement during the last few months.Improvement Is of course slow, but oertain.  Trains circulateand arrive fairly punctually, while railway repair shops are working full time, partie^larly at Alexandrovsk.  Hundreds ofbroken-down wagons line the permanent way sidings at stations in the coal area, but at others rone were seen,  fourteen loco-motives needing repair were seen at Djanka Station, but nonewere observable elsewhere..
                       ml A,       2. CRI^CBA AND SEBASTOFQL,                              ^(a)    Throughout the whole of the Government, of the Tauridathe harvest is excellent,  the yield over. 200 poods (say 3 anda half tons) per desiatine of 2.7 acres.   Italian merchants,attracted by the reports of the good harvest, have been trying to arrange barter trade.   Grain was.gathered in and concentrated in the homesteads successfully, work &apos;on the fields proceedingvigorously.&apos;   There is no organisation for distributing foodstuffs,and the freedom of trade has led to an increase of 5&quot;0 per cent,and more, owing to lack of control and extensive purchases by private traders for Odessa and contiguous towns.   Honestgovernment intervention is essential, but care must be taken to exclude corrupt elements.   In Sebastopol flour has risen from140 roubles to 200 roubles per pood.   On  2Cth September flourcould &quot;be bought at Perekop at 30 roubles a pood, so that thequestion of supply and  demand causes wide fluctuations.  No TEAis arriving and. costs up to 300 roubles front when obtainable,Ceylon quality..   No Batum/t^a to be. had.   There is little SUGAR .on the market and. it costs 28 to 33 roubles -per front.       Absence of meat  prevents the issue of rations to the troops.EGGS cost 32 roubles for ten, although plentiful on the market.Good  BUTTER easily obtainable at 86 roubles per front, a rise from $0 roubles taking  place on l^th September.  Vegetables arescarce and dear,, potatoes fluctuating between % and 9^ roubles perpood.   -FRUIT is considerably  below Rcstoff rates,  despite a rise from 8 roubles per front on l th september to 15 roubles on1st October, owing to coastal trade with Odessa.   Melons cost &apos;60roubles per 100, 2 roubles each being asked  on the  stations.EREAT costs 4 roubles per front. . OATS  pO rouhlea per pood,   Anyquantity of wine at  0  roubles per bottle against 300 and 3^0 inRostoff. -   .(b)    The *ost of living is on the whole the same  as in Rostoff,restaurant prices ruling lower.. .  Speculation and profiteering arerife, the Jewish element being in greater evidence  than before
mm   m15the war!   Poverty is less than formerly,    Peasants  are  affluent,having made a lot of money.   They are buying grain from  the farmers and amassing stocks.    In the Yalta district  of-the crimea the cost of living has risen owing to the arrival  of  from300 to 600 people with each steamer,.everything is dearer than inUovorossisk and Sebastopol.   The cheapest place of all  isTheodosia.( c)   . All factories in Sebastopol are in full swing, a  lot  of repair work on vessels proceeding apace,  and the results  aremanifest.   One cruiser has already been repaired, and torpedo boats are-in&apos; hand.   Factories are being run on commercial lines,workmen earning on &quot;collective agreement&quot; up to 2,000 roublesmonthly, while those taken on by the month receive 1,200 roubles.Labour is plentiful.   A general strike occurred  on the  lothSeptember, but only lasted a day, during which quite  a number ofmen refused to cease work.   Soap works are mostly sHit  down owingto lack of raw materials and fuel.   All  industrial undertakingsare suffering badly through lack of fuel, the supply of which isvery  low everywhere.   The Economic Mission  is trying to arrangefor supplies of  oil fuel from Batoum.(d)    The Commander of the Fortress, Major-General  Subbotin, isnot energetic and  is slow  to act.(e)    The leanings of the town&apos;  elements  are undoubtedly socialis-tic,  which is reflected  in the elections.    In  Sebastopo-1 the-municipal elections resulted in  the  socialists winning 3&amp; seats tothe landlords 21 and 6 democrats, while  in the  other towns ofsouth Russia the landlords got the upper  hand.(f)     Kb broken-down locomotives or  trucks  were  to  be seen  either at Sebastopol or Simferopol  stations,(g)     A  press campaign  is being prosecuted  at  Sebastopol with  aview  tcgetting  the place  declared a  commercial port.    The idea is an old one, and as there  is no need of  a  commercial port  there and no  commerce  to maintain  it,  the  propaganda  is to be  attributed to private interests.
                                                           16       3.   QIS1SSA DISTRICT.(a)     The Kherson Government has enjoyed a magnificent  harventyielding 250*300 poods to the desiatine.   All grain has beengathered in the localities adjacent to Odessa, but in the Elisa-bethgrad region difficulties have been experienced in consequenceof the&quot;numerous bands of dispersed Bolsheviks,  The peasants araadopting a friendly attitude towards the Volunteer Army and land-owners,.   In the Elisabethgrad neighbourhood, the peasants acting in concert with the landowners took away the agricultural implementsduring the Bolshevik regime, returning them on the arrival of theV.A,troops.   On the 20th S-jpfrembor the prio-e of flour was about  200roubles per pcod, best quality, while the inferior grades were goingat 80 roubles per pood.  BREAD costs 8 roubles per pood as against.8.0 roubles under the Bolsheviks and 3 roubles at Rostoff, and istending lower.  TEA is plentiful,  good Chinese at l60 roubles perFoont, Fair old stocks of sugar at 720 roubles per pood,  MEAT is at3C roubles per front, but in such  little quantity that no-issues aremade to the troops.  The Bclsheviks took away all the aattle. BUTTERis scarce and fetches 110-120 roubles per front *  POTATOES cost 16-3roubles per poos1..  EGGS  j?2 roubles for ten.  $Municipality rationsthe population for bread and fuel,(b)    The  cost of living at ODESSA is very high, which  is reflected in the charges for food  on the steamers, oosting  six times as muchas in the Rcstcff restaurants.   Manufactured goods are  scarce andthe shops accordingly  empty, prices ruling thrice as high asSebastopol.       Tramway fares are 3 roubles for a short  journey.,  against rouble  in Rostcff.  As regards CATTLE a  oow fetches 4j,000roubles,  a horse  2^,000  roubles-   Noted for  its huge Jewishpopulation  in the past,  OrESSA now teems with them,  speculating  andprofiteering on a large  scale.   Of course not only  Jews  are doing this sort of thing, but  the  fact that Jews  are  present  in such large numbers is  incensing the Russians who have  suffered suchatrocities  and  ill-treatment at  the hands  of  the  Sovietcommissionaries,  aided by the Hebrews-.
     It-is-very provable that the cost of living in ODESSA will soon lessen, as b$ its situation it will have tne benefit ofthe coastwise trade and small craft and barges are alreadymaking their appearance with cargoes of varied description,while bigger ships will&apos; no doubt come in with heavier loads,once a mode of exchange bv barter or other method is found.(c)   Works and factories are at a standstill, due as in the crimea, to lack of fuel, but in a much greater degree.   TheRussian Company of Trade &amp; Industryfs shipbuilding yard is working,and railway workshops are preparing to start up.   The tramshave only been running since the 20th September, when a supplyof oil arrived and enabled the power station to run.   &apos;.:&apos;atersupply is weak and intermittent.   The town Council is looking after the distribution of the small stocks of fuel amongst thepopulation, but the whole question of coal,  oil and wood supplyrequires earnest and immediate attention.   I am doing ray best to arxfws*p for an exchange of oil between Batoum and Odossa forthe needs of the railway and other purposes.   Unfortunately thedilatoriness and apathy of Departments and general difficultiesmake progress  unavoidably slow, despite all energy andinsistence displayed by the Economics Mission to push thingsforward.   LABOUR is plentiful but very dear owing to theprice of things.  Under the Bolsheviks the working populationhad to set nut *n foot to the villages to get tomatoes,vegetables, etcetera to enable them to subsist.(d)   As the town has only recently been liberated, the directionof affairs is at present in the hands of small commanders ofmilitary sections.   The commands-in-Chief of lovorossta,General Shilling, has not yet put in apps arance (he has arrivedsince this news was communicated) and the lack of firm rule isvery noticeable.   Continual arrests of Bolsheviks aganta arebeing oarrled out.(e)   In consequence of the considerable Jewish population,it is difficult to analyse the genuine feeling of Odessa, for ,
                          -  8  -                                18while the  Jews are mostly pro-Bolshevik,the other elements hevesuffered too much to be otherwise than bitterly anti-Bolsh&apos;- riksYet in the places where crowds mostly assemble, ice. restaurants,cafes, theatres, etc., the  incisive declamations against theBolsheviks witnessed on the liberation of Ekaterinoslav,Khsrkoff and&apos;Kursk weie lacking,, hat on.t&apos;-idc Odessa in thehamlets and villages feeling against the. Bolsheviks runs very high,  the&apos; German colonists  showing particular animosity to theBolsheviks, as many of them were tortured and killed,  whilemost of the others suffered in other ways.(f)   The sidings and turnouts at Odessa Station and outside aremimumbered with broken-down locomotives and rolling stock,while the warehouses,  sheds and other property belonging to theAll Russian Zemsky Union and the Union of Towns,  are inlamentable condition.    Anything movable,  if in good condition and of use, was taken away by the Bolsheviks,        &apos;   4. IIEI? .     Eieff is still shut in on three ,sides, the only accessbeing by the Ek&amp;terinoslav Railway,  PetliuraTs troops (UkraineSeparatists) while the red guards of the Bolsheviks hold theremainder of the surrounding country,     Kieff has suffered untold agony and privations, and thepopulation shews Signs of emaciation and hunger,   Food is exceedingly dear and scares, while transport to Kieff fromEkaterinoslav is difficult  and slow.  The situation has the attention of the General Staff,  and I am keeping watch.   anything that can be done by the Economic section to bring about improve-ment,  effect relief or facilitate despatch of goods will be done.MeWtJuac I am not in a position to report accurately on thesituation there, but will supplement the present by a further communication at thh earliest possible moment,                 (Signed) F..V.3, Binder, Major.
