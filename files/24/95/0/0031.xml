Mr.  LonghurstHSECJRET.MINISTRY   OF   FOOD.eport  for Month  ending 15th  December 1919.    Meat. The necessary measures  have been taken  for carrying into  effect  theconclusions of the Cabinet Conference of the 9th December.  The enforced registration of customers has been discontinued as from the 15th instant and butchers have been set at liberty to  procure such imported meat as they require from any source they mayprefer.  It is not clear that these increased facilities will materially help the Board ofTrade in disposing of their imported  mutton and  lamb  without loss.   The continuedcontrol  of home-produced meat, in- the interests  of the farmers,  coupled with  thede-control of imported meat, except  so  far as maximum prices are  concerned,  has produced a situation of great difficulty for the Ministry of Food, and Smithfield tradersare insistent in  their complaint that they are unable to get into touch with their normalsuppliers, while complete freedom is  given to the representatives  of importers, whoare in some cases agents of the American Meat Trust, to push their business throughoutthe country.  It is proposed  to reduce the price of imported beef by 2d. a lb., bothwholesale and  retail, as from Monday. 6th January.  The carriage of  all imported meat will in  future be payable by the buyer.  The Food Controller  is considering whether he can acquiesce in the withdrawal  of the control of hides at the end ofthe year and recover the extra value  of the hides  accruing to the  retail butcher by increasing the per head charge on cattle and sheep..    Sugar. The Sugar Commission are gravely concerned  as to the  price of  rawsugar in January, if it should be necessary to effect the usual purchases in that month.At present the price paid for prompt sugar in America is double the price  in  thiscountry.  They suggest that the public should be urged  to take a long view and shouldconsent  to a reduced domestic  ration for the  months of  February and  March,in order to obviate the necessity of January purchases.  They are conscious that  thiswill involve some popular discontent, and, moreover, that there is much  to be saidfrom the health point of view against any further reduction of the sugar ration, butthey are convinced that the maintenance of the present ration will involve an increasein the retail price of more than 2d. a lb.  The matter has been referred to the cabinet for decision.    Milk. The maximum retail prices of winter milk have been carefully reconsideredin view of the opinion expressed by the Milk Prices Investigation Committee.  Theiropinion was based on  the assumption that the average yield  per  cow  in milk  was2 gallons a  day; whereas the technical advisers had estimated  that it  would notexceed i\ gallons.  The Food  Controller had informed the Committee that if theirassumption was correct he would alter the price ; and that  if the  opinion  of his advisers was correct he would adhere to it.  His decision was  deferred until he couldreceive  some  86,000 returns  of milk production  for the week ending Saturday, the6th December.   Sixty thousand  of these returns have now  been received  and the summary of results subject to checking shows the average production per cow per dayas follows:     In the. circumstances Mr. Roberts is unable to modify the maximum prices whichwere fixed in agreement with the Department of Agriculture, after the most exhaustiveinvestigation into the cost of production that has ever been effected in this country.    With the recommendation of the Committee that steps should be taken to ensure a supply of milk to children under five  years of age and to expectant and nursing mothers free from the taint of charity which has been thought to apply to the term&quot; necessitous cases,&quot; the Food Controller is in entire agreement, and he proposes, withthe concurrence of the Minister of Health, to amend the terms of the Milk (Mothersand Children) Order, 1918, providing for the issue of milk, either free or below cost,in all cases where by reason of the  retail price the Local Authority is satisfied thatsuch special provision is desirable.   It is understood that in non-necessitous cases theLocal Authority will not be able to obtain any Treasury grant unless existing policyis modified.

      FisU. On 10th December, in the absence of the Food  Controller, Sir Arthur&apos; Boscawen received a deputation to the Ministry of Food and Board of Agriculture, protesting  against the reimposition  of control of  iish  other than prime  fish.   The deputation consisted of representatives  of trawl owners, captains and men, and whole- sale fish merchants.   The retailers were not  represented.   Their objection was to control of prices on the ground that the increased catch of  fish now to he obtained would of itself reduce prices and thereby render maximum prices unnecessary.  They also objected on the ground of  difficulties in the sharing out of particular fish at the ports where the maximum price was reached.  The fishermen&apos;s representatives stated. that the imposition of a maximum price deprived them of opportunities of recouping themselves for the smallness of their earnings when fish was  plentiful and the price low.      These points have been  considered in  consultation with the fish distribution officers, the situation having  in the  meantime been  complicated by the refusal of certain trawl owners at Grimsby to observe the conditions of  the  Order, coupled with the threat to tie up their boats if the Order is enforced.  It appears that the agitation proceeds from  a  portion, not  the whole, of  the Grimsby trawler&apos; owners,  who have amassed  enormous  profits during the  war.   For  example,  prospectuses have been issued of two new companies which show profits  in one case  of over 50 per cent.,  and in another case of 75 per cent, on present working.      The Board of  Agriculture, while  concurring in the  detailed  Schedule, have expressed a preference for the  absence  of restrictive prices, but the Food  Controller feels  that while he is  quite  prepared to consider  any reasonable  suggestions as to modification of the Order, if such are made (which is not at present the case), it would be impolitic to relax control of fish until later in the season.      Bacon. The indifferent  bacon which  was imported on private account  and requisitioned by the Ministry  in August, has now for the most part been consumed, and three-fourths of the weekly issues consist of Government purchases of good quality.  The present system of centralised buying  eliminates speculation and secures an even flow of good quality bacon to the British market at  prices based strictly on the price of the hog.  Contracts are made with individual packinghouses in America whereby they make each week a definite quantity of bacon, the price being based on a sliding scale in accordance with the weekly average price of hogs, as shown in  the official Chicago daily quotations.  The  Canadian packer is allowed to pay for his  hog one  Cdnt per  lb. above Chicago  prices.   Arrangements are made for  automatic despatch, so as to preclude any possibility of congestion at the ports.   These contracts will run until April 30th, 1920, by which time it  is hoped that a  system of trade centralised buying, under Government supervision,  will be set up in place of direct Government purchases.      Against the fall in hog prices which followed upon the resumption of Government control, has to be  set the very heavy fall  in  exchange.  The Treasury  have only covered the Ministry&apos;s dollar  requirements to the 31st December, and that at a  rate which is not particularly favourable.  Practically the whole of the January, February, and March commitments are uncovered, and  as  the difference between the exchange at 4.20 and the exchange at 3.70 represents about 750,000L per month on the bacon, ham, and lard purchasing programme, it is difficult to estimate precisely when it  will be possible to reduce the price of bacon.  It is hoped  that  important  shipments of Danish bacon will be made in tbe new year.     Gaitle Cakes and Meals. The increase in margarine production has re-acted most favourably upon the crushing industry,  and it would now be  possible to produce in this country all the cattle cake normally required for consumption.   Fresh mills, moreover, of considerable magnitude are now under construction.  As an instance of the progress made during the present year, it may be noted that in the whole of 1918, the monthly average of imported cake and meals  was 7,089 tons, while in the month of November, 1919, the  amount  imported was 88,719 tons, which exceeds  the total quantity imported during the year 1918.  So far as home production is concerned, the monthly average in 19.18 was 62,009 tons, while in the month ofi November, 1919, the output was 105,425 tons, notwithstanding that a number of mills were closed owing to difficulties of transport.    Net  imports of the principal  foodstuffs into the United Kingdom in November,with the  chief exceptions of sugar and tea, were lower than those of October, though

The general level of; cereal stocks is lower this year but the seasonal decreasehas  been less marked.   The  position  as  regards meat  and bacon  remains as  inOctober, the smaller arrivals of bacon setting free storage space for the accommodation of the increasing stocks of meat, which reached 119,000 tons,  Arrivals of butterwere inadequate to meet ration requirements, and there was a serious fall in stocks.The larger arrivals of sugar and tea were reflected in improved stocks, though in thecase of  sugar  the improvement was  very slight, and in that of tea it is still accom-panied by invisible trade stocks below the normal level.     The estimated  consumption  of  butchers&apos;  meat  by  civilians in  Great Britainfluctuated with the proportion of  home  supplies available, and in spite of the abun-dance of imported meat, the average  weekly total consumption was slightly less thanin October.   Consumption of flour as indicated by the deliveries of flour from mills,remained at the seasonal level of last year.     The statistics collected by the Ministry of  Labour show a continued rise in the retail prices of foodstuffs.  The percentage  increase since July 1914, which  stood at131&apos;4 in November 1st, rose to 134&apos;3 on December 1st. The only important decreaseswere the reduction of 2d. per lb. on imported mutton, and  a fall of 3-1- per cent, in fish.These decreases were quite outweighed by the  addition of Id. per  lb.  on  sugar,  anincrease of  fd. per lb. on  tea and seasonal advances  in milk and eggs.  As regardswholesale prices in November,  home-grown cereals, except barley, showed a downwardtendency.   The wholesale, prices of sugar, following on the action of the sugar commission, showed increases corresponding to the higher retail  prices.  The only other marked variation was in the group  of oilseeds, where  prices moved upwards,while in the case of oilseed cake prices  fluctuated for different varieties.
