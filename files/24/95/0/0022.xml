HIB Brlfartniri Majesty-&apos;8 Government.   /  I submit the following to the Cabinet and ask for a decision.^-/T^^                        (Sgd.)  L, VfQRTHINGTON-EVANS.^6INJT^                         .     18th December, 1919.                   DISABILITIES ,IN MILITARY OR NAVAL SERVICE.&apos;&quot;&quot;..  - 35P. a A 111]         -^yO/f1  Several cases of hardship arising from Disabilities  ^IJU 0H^eorient on injury sustained  in Peace time have been represented     to me, and I am satisfied that  the scale of compensation at present     available for these cases is gravely Inadequate.  That scale is, in     the case of the Army, laid down in the Pay and Pensions Warrant of     1914 under which the maximum Disability Pension that a private can     get Is 2/6d  a day  (17/6d. a week) without any allowance for wife     and children.               In my submission of the 2nd May to the Sailors and     Soldiers 1 Pay Committee I proposed that exceptional cases of hardship     of this character should be dealt with under the Dispensing Warrant     and the pensions increased to the rates plus bonus, which would have     been granted if the disability  had been incurred in this war.  The     Committee agreed to my recommendation, but the Cabinet came to no     decision on the matter and the  Treasury have since that date raised     strong objection to dealing with the cases referred to on these lines               I am satisfied that cases of serious disability involving     extreme loss of the manTs earning capacity, such as the loss of a     leg blown off by the bursting of a gun, cannot be  left on the present     scale  of award and  I would propose that In cases- of 5.6$ disability     and upwards arising from injury, the pension should be revised to the     scale  of the present war Warrants, but without wife ?s  or children^     allowances.  There  are comparatively few of these  cases and their    &apos;re-assessment should not present great difficulty,  I  should not     propose to amend the pay warrant of 1914 for this  purpose, but I     desire authority for the Ministry of Pensions to deal  with the cases     under  the Dispensing Warrant on these  lines without reference in each     case to the Treasury.JL.W.E.                   I  18th December, 1919.
