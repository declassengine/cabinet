DOOUMMT^IS. THE PB0PS3TY OF HIS BRITAPIO MAJESTY1 3 GOVERNM3?)                          0 A. B I NET      It has boon found impossible to rocoh agreement among themembers of tho Committee, which ho a1 been considering tho proposals      In the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and theMinister of Pensions, any increase in the existing scale of cashnot bo extended to the enhancement of the oash benefits.  ,i$*$$ypressed., therefore, that tho contributions should be increasedby Id, in addition  to the increase proposed by mo.   In t:view of the Secretary forScotland this could not be facedwithout first consulting the Approved Societies and he urgedthis consultation as the next step.   Sir Robert Home concurredwith Mr(,Monro, but was extremely doubtful of obtaining the aquiescence of the Societies.      In my view it is essential that the Government&apos;s proposalsfor Health Insurance should be snnouncoc in Parliament beforethe House  rises,, since the Unemployment Insurance Bill Is tobe introduced on Monday.    It is thus not practicable to consulttho Societies on the new proposal..   Their  views are in factalready well known to mo by my consultations with thorn an the       /ojii^tang proposals-   My advisers and 1 are perfectly certainCP. 316NAT10UAL HEALTH INSURANCE.,Memo, by mo Minister of Health.   .

It would then become
apparent that the  further Id,it is proposed to &quot;bo obtained fromthorn was virtually destined to relieve tho Exchequer of theincreased cost of me&amp;ic.*;,!l. benefit.   This alone would causethorn to offer thoir strenuous resistance quite apcrt from thefact that it would be resisted as too greet o payment forwomen.-..      Further&apos;, the  cfci&amp;fciie woul d immediately soy thet if theyare to be called upon to pay the whole cost of medical benefit,it must be. left to thorn to make arrangements for it.    Theycould obviously not be called upon  to find whatever sums mightbe. involved, in bargains mode by the Government, in which theyhad. no voice, with the doctors. .  The Chancellor of tho Exchequerand the Minister of Pensions favoured such an arrangement.I reminded them that this, though proposed in the original Billin 1911. was deliberately altered In Parliament, and to go backon it In 1920 would be quite impossible in view of the attitudeof the medical profession^      I ought here to say that the proposed Increased payment for doctors evon at the rate at which I have now, under pressure,&apos;reduced my former proposals,.is not. agreed to by the Committeeand is particularly resisted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,/and the Secretary for Scotland,  I have, against my bettor&apos; judgmentreduced my figure to 11/&apos;- (exclusive of mileage);  Mr.Munrorefuses to go beyond 10/-..

18th Deoember,1919,reduced to nil.   I agreed that this&apos; proposal should bo looked into but it -was stated at the mooting &quot;that tho administrative difficulties involved would bo-insuperable   For example,an employer would hevo to find out (in respect of ,-,11 hisemployees) under which of tho two scales they c&amp;mo,  ;;.nd infact the whole principle of .- flot. r.to of contribution wouldhave boon destroyed though the benefits would remain thesame for all.
