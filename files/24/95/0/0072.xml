WINSTON  S.  CHUECHILL.  29th December, 1919.      MEMOEANDUM  ON THE FUTUEE  OEGANIZATION  OF  THE                           TEEEITOR1AL FOECE.     1. When  the announcement was  made  last spring  that it  was  intended  toreconstitute the  Territorial Force on the old  pre-war lines it was pointed out thatthis  decision could only  be  provisional as the scale, character and organization ofthe  Force  could  not  be  determined until the Peace  Conference  had concluded itslabours and the general lines  of our  military policy had been laid down in conformitywith our obligations.   At that time, however, it was manifest at  any rate that, theForce having proved itself to  be such an invaluable support to the regular Army in thelate war, no time should be lost in stating that it. was the intention of the Governmentto preserve it as an essential and vital part of our military system.     Since that announcement was  made we  have reached a clearer conception of our military needs  and the financial  limits  within which our Army organization will haveto be confined in peace time.     2. Broadly speaking, the effects of the terms of peace on the general  militarysituation are :      (i.) War,  on a scale entailing the passing of a Military Service  Act,  or the           contingency of an invasion of these islands  could not be  taken imto con-           sideration for some years to come.    (ii.) It is by no means unlikely  that (at any time during  the next 10 years) we           may become involved in  military operations abroad  with  which our normal           regular Forces, reduced  to a minimum, could not cope, unless a trustworthy           second line were  immediately available  after the Army  Eeserve had  been           called out.   (B19/591) 100  12/19 H&amp;S  7815wo
     These two considerations taken  in conjunction, with  the greatly emphasized needfor immediate  economies on  all public services, lead  to the conclusion that for reasonsother than  political  a Territorial Force whose general  obligations were confined to home Defence would be an extravagance, and would be regarded seriously by no one asit would in no way meet  the military needs which confront us.  If retained at  all  itwould be liable  to be starved financially, and it would  thus become  an  inefficientorganization even for expansion in the case of a  first-class  war.     3. If the Territorial  Force undertook, an obligation for general service on the issueof a  Proclamation  calling out the  Army Reserve (i.e.,  in the  event  of  a national emergency of great importance, but not so serious as  to justify the immediate introductionof a Military Service  Act), they would be  able  to  discharge to the full the role of a genuine second line to the  Regular Forces of the Crown.   There is a strong preponderance of opinion,  among those in closest touch  with the  Territorial  Force at the  presentmoment, that  they would be  ready to  undertake  this  obligation, (under suitableconditions) in  sufficient numbers for present purposes.     4. It would  thus be possible to replace a  complicated and costly  machinery ofdifferent classes of Reserve Forces (behind the  Regular Army and its first Reserve) hya single,  simple and inexpensive organization closely assimilated to that of the regular forces.   Such an arrangement would  be  financially economical  as.compared with alternative  expedients for providing  the reinforcements immediately necessary on theoutbreak of a  war of less than first-class  dimensions.   It would also enable the  cadresand general organization of the Territorial Force to be preserved as an efficient nucleusfor expansion, in  the event of a war necessitating the passing of a Military Service Act,and in this connection it is  held that the creation of a framework on right lines shouldbe the main objective.     5. From the purely military point  of view the  advantages of this proposal areconclusive.     The scheme  for  reorganizing the Army, introduced  by Lord  Haldane in  1907,aimed at having two lines in place of three by  the  absorption of the Militia into thefirst line and the  Yeomanry into the second.     The purpose of the second line was  to fulfil the  functions  of Home Defence  bycompelling a hostile Power, which might attempt invasion, to send a force so large thatits transport  could not evade  our-  fleets,  and to free  the Regular Army from thenecessity of remaining in these islands.     We were faced with  this eventuality in 1914,  but the war which followed has inits results changed the whole outlook.     The defeat of the Central Powers and the destruction  of the German Fleet, whilerendering the  possibility  of  invasion more remote   than  ever,  has emphasized and increased our responsibilities overseas.     Our military problems  of the near future, intensified by the world unrest, point tothe  probability that  at  any time in the  next  10 years  we may become involved in military operations abroad, with which our normal regular forces, reduced to a minimumowing to financial  stringency, could not  cope  without the assistance of a second line which can be relied upon to meet such a contingency.     At the same time the Government, giving expression to the will  of the country,has pledged itself to a reversion to the voluntary system, notwithstanding its recognizeddrawbacks in regard to inequality of operation and uncertainty of results.     The principal  need,  therefore, of the immediate  future is to provide a second line,not merely as an organization for expansion in the  improbable event of a war of firstmagnitude,  but for the more probable need of support and maintenance of the RegularArmy overseas in the case of operations as outlined in 2 (ii) above, but not of sufficientmagnitude to  justify the passing of a Military Service Act.    The responsibility for theprovision of an adequate second line  under the voluntary system must  rest with thepublic and the necessity for this second line must be made clear.     In this connection it  should be borne in mind  that  after the expiration of theMilitary Service Acts in April, 1920, there will  be  practically no substantial reserves  ofany -kind for  the Regular Army, and that whether they are raised as Army Reservists,Special Reserves, or as a Territorial  second line, these reserves will have to  be raised from the civilian  population on a voluntary  basis.     6. From the political point of view there is&apos;the risk  that the obligation to serveabroad on  the occurrence of. a national emergency, whatever safeguards may be intro-duced, will prove too great  a strain on the Territorial  Forces, and that the attempt  toimposedt may prove a failure.
     Should this fear turn out to be correct there would still be the  identical  organiza-tion which will closely follow the organization of the Regular Army and the alternative of reverting to the florae Service obligation only,  with  the possibility  of inducing a fraction of the  Force to undertake the larger obligation by  special inducements.   Sucha reversion would bring the nation considerably  nearer  to  compulsion in the event ofany emergency with which the Regular Forces could not cope.     On the other  hand, it  may be  argued  that as, after their experience in  1914, themen will know that if the emergency  arises they are certain to be the first to  be calledupon, it is better to tell them boldly what the extent of their liability will be in certainpossible circumstances rather than to ask  them  to  undertake  one form of serviceknowing that should those circumstances arise they will be wanted for another.     7. After anxious consideration of both points of view  the conclusion  has beenreached that the military contention is sound in principle and should be adopted.     8. The recommendations, therefore, are :      (i.) That the pre-war Territorial Force shall  be reconstituted,  and organized as            14  divisions,  approximating  closely to the composition of  the  Regular            divisions  of the  Army,  together  with  army  and  corps  troops,  and 10            mounted  Yeomanry  regiments,  available  to form the  nucleus of a  2nd            Cavalry  Division on  mobilization,  and also to  provide corps cavalry.   (A            table, showing the complete organization  on  a war  establishment basis, is            given in Appendix A.)    (ii.) That  the Territorial Force  organization shall  be  the  normal  means  for the            temporary expansion, of the Array in  a  national emergency, and for this            purpose the cadres of the 1.4 divisions should  be preserved  intact as the            framework of a national mobilization  on a compulsory basis.    (iii.) That the Territorial Force shall be  so organized as to be available to support            the Regular Army if required in a  war of too serious a nature for the latter            with its reserve  to cope  with successfully and not  sufficiently serious to            demand the re-enactment of a  Military Service  Act.    (iv.) That until otherwise ordered, enlistments into the  Territorial Force  shall not            exceed a peace establishment based on 50 per cent, of the war establishment.            of  &quot; other ranks &quot; than commissioned officers.     9. Unless otherwise provided for by Act  of Parliament,  when  an emergencyarises, the conditions of service in the Territorial Force shall provide :      (i.) Liability for General Service.    (ii.) An undertaking that the Territorial Force, or any  portion  of it,  shall not be            embodied before the Regular Reserve has been  called up by  Proclamation,            although all  individual   members  of  the   Regular   Reserve  may  not            necessarily have been ordered to join.    (iii.) Liability alter embodiment to be used &quot; in support of&quot;  the Regular  Army in            the form of either  (i) units or  (ii)  drafts provided  in  case  of  (ii) that            such drafts are  not sent abroad  in smaller formations  than squadrons,            batteries  or  companies, of their corps, and that subsequently they are sent            out to reinforce units of  the same corps,  with  the  exception of  men who            accept a special liability hereinafter described as &quot; Special Class &quot; men.    (iv.)  Subject always  to  limitation in  (iii)  above,  the  Territorial  Force soldier            after embodiment shall be liable to  the  same  conditions as  the  Regular            soldier in regard to (a) attachment  to a corps other  than  his own as a            temporary measure to meet an  emergency, (6)  exemption from compulsory-            transfer to a corps other than his own.    (v.) For the enlistment of  a  &quot;Special Class &quot; into each unit  of the Territorial            Force, supernumerary to  the authorized  maximum  peace strength of the           units.                As regards  the numbers  to be  so enlisted in each unit, they should.           he  regulated by  and complementary  to the  number of Army Reservists            available behind the affiliated Regular Army unit or corps.                ,                These specially enlisted  men would  undertake a  liability similar to           that of  the Regular Reservists and for  which a monetary consideration           would  be given.   They would  act  as  a visible  buffer between the rest of           the Territorial Force and  the too sudden  operation of the General Service           obligation, and would  in effect be  a second  reinforcement immediately           behind the Army Reserve.     (7815)                                                                   A 2
    (vi.) For  the  formation of Reserve  units so soon as  Regular units had begun            to mobilize.   The  cadres  of such Reserve  units  being drawn from  the            affiliated Territorial units, and supplemented by personnel from the mobilized            Regular units and depots.     Note. The liability for General Service would  necessitate an amendment of the Territorial and Rese7ve&quot;Fo&quot;rces Act&quot;     10. General advantages to the Territorial Force  in the proposed military system.  There  is the great advantage  to  the  Territorial Force  generally, if they accept  the proposed increased  obligations for  General  Service, that they will  have a recognized position as a genuine second line of the Army and as the organization through which any expansion of the military forces in  the event  of a great war will be effected, and it is obvious that if they assume this exceedingly important position in the general military system, grievances which have occurred during the late war in regard to the breaking up of  Territorial Force organizations, and the position of Territorial Force soldiers as compared with  those brought into  the organization of the New Armies, will not be likely  to recur.   The Territorial  Force will, in  fact, be assimilated in  all  material respects to the &quot;organization of the  Regular Army and will be the only reserve outside the Regular Army and its  Reserves.  Our military system will thus be clearly defined, and the anomalies arising from the  position of the  Territorials as a force confined to service within the United Kingdom will disappear.  Their military efficiency and value in the late war has been  fully  recognized, but  they will now assume a wholly different degree of national importance and will receive a degree of support for all purposes, both from the Regulars and Parliament, v/hich has hitherto been denied to them.     18. The  increased  liability   will   necessitate  increased   monetary attractions, particularly from the training point of view.   These  are as follows :      (i.) Increased pay,  &amp;c,  in  camp. Officers and  men of  the Territorial Force when undergoing training in camp  will reap the benefits of the increased rates of pay recently  conceded  to officers&apos; and  men of the  Regular Army.   This  amounts, approximately, to double  the pre-war rates in the case of officers, and nearly treble the pre-war rates in the  case of non-commissioned officers and men.  Non-commissioned officers and  men will  also  benefit by such increased rates of separation allowance as may be approved, if married, and they will all  receive rations on the prescribed full or peace scale  with messing  allowance  in  addition.  Although these last are not  increases  to the  pay which a  man gets into  his  own pocket, they will undoubtedly be  greatly increased attractions for  men  taking a full 15  days&apos; holiday in camp  voluntarily  as compared with the  expenses of taking  another holiday and  incurring the  greatly increased cost of feeding themselves and their families at  the present increased  prices.     (ii.) Bounties. (a.)  The bounty of  ll.  per head for  a  Territorial who completed 15  days&apos; training in  camp  in  addition to his compulsory  drills and musketry, was granted before the war, and provision was made  for this  in  Estimates for 1914 15 ; but in point of fact very few units did actually come up for training in that year before the outbreak of war,  and  thus the effect of this  concession has  not yet been put  to practical proof.  Particular stress is laid upon it, however, in view of the greatly increased military efficiency obtained  by  inducing men to  undergo the full 15 days&apos; training  in camp as opposed to the 8  days&apos; compulsory minimum.    (6.) It is also now proposed to pay a sum calculated on the total number of drills which  the Territorial performs, up to a maximum of  50, at the rate of Is. per drill, and to pay him  an additional 10s.  for firing the annual  musketry course.  The particular advantage of these  payments  is that  they will in effect cover  certain  out-of-pocket expenses which the man must inevitably incur  in  one way or another in coming  up for drills and musketry.  It  cannot be  reasonably anticipated under post-war conditions that individuals  will be  prepared  to  make  out-of-pocket  disbursements at  their own expense  in the performance of  public service and the proposed additional benefits under  these heads will meet the case of  the Territorial for  this  purpose.  The actual expenditure on  these heads will probably be  far below the maximum figure based on effectives during the  next few  years.   A very large  proportion of the original recruits of the reconstituted Territorial  Force will, presumably, consist of re-enlisted  men&apos; who have done war service. It is highly improbable that  any large proportion of these men will, in  fact,  be ready to do more  than  the  obligatory minimum of drills, and it isonly as the re-enlisted men drop out  that a  maximum  expenditure under this headwill be approached.
     (c.) It is further proposed to give an additional bounty of il.  to men (other thanrecruits) who have performed 50 drills in all and fired  the annual  musketry course andhave completed an attendance of 15 days at the annual training in camp,  It will thus be possible for  an efficient  Territorial who  fulfils all the  above conditions  to  receive a maximum in benefits of one kind or another of  5l. in  the year,  but  in point of fact,it is highly improbable for reasons already stated, that in the immediate future any largeproportion of the force will qualify  for the  ll., additional bounty on completing all thesetests.   It is estimated that not more than 5 per cent, of  the total  effectives  willqualify for the full bl. in bounties in the course of the next year of so.     (iii.) Clothing. Full issue of clothing for the Territorials will  be made, including,if practicable, free issues of boots  for camp.

APPENDIX D.                            TERRITORIAL  FORCE.                        Conditions of Service after the War.     1. The object of this  pamphlet is to explain generally to those who wish to enlistin the Territorial Force the terms and conditions under which they will serve.     2. Service in this Force, as in the pre-war Force, is purely  voluntary,  and a man who enlists in it has the right  in time of peace  of terminating his engagement underthe conditions which are stated below.     3. The present plan for the reconstruction of the Territorial Force after the war  isto  adapt  the  old  Force  to  the  military  requirements of the future  based  on  theexperience of the war.   The experience of the  war has proved  the military value ofthe Territorial Force, and the  desirability  of assigning to  it a position of increasing importance in the general  organization of  national military  resources.   Briefly, it  isintended  that  the  Force shall  be  reconstituted  on  a footing  that will enable it todischarge to the full the role of a genuine second line to the Regular Army.   It  will therefore be assimilated as far as possible in organization to the Regular Army itself, witha view to supporting  the latter, in the event of a  national emergency, involving the calling out of the  Army Reserve on permanent service, and forming a nucleus for any necessary expansion of the  forces of the Crown.  For this purpose men joining the force will be required to undertake increased liabilities involving general service if and when a proclamation calling out the Army  Reserve  on permanent service, has been  issued.The Army Reserve can only &quot;be called out in case of imminent national danger or ofgreat emergency, the occasion being first communicated to Parliament, if Parliament  issitting, or declared in Council and  notified by Proclamation if Parliament is not sitting.     The scheme of reconstitution also  includes  improved financial conditions, details ofwhich are shown  below.                 COMPOSITION  OP  THE FOECE NEW SPECIAL CLASS.     4. The Territorial Force will consist of (1) an establishment of units and formationsgenerally similar to that of the Territorial Force before the war,  and (2) over and above this establishment a  &quot;special  class&quot;  consisting  of officers with men specially enlisted,with liabilities similar to those of the Army  Reserve, who will receive  a suitable dailyrate of remuneration so long as they remain in this class.   The  function of the specialclass  will be to provide reinforcements behind  the Army Reserve in the first instanceon mobilisation, thus ensuring that a reasonable period will elapse before the rest of theTerritorial Force, if it  is necessary to embody it, is actually  called upon  to fulfil its-general service obligations.                   MEN ELIGIBLE AND  PERIOD  OP ENGAGEMENT.     5. The men to be enlisted are as follows :          (a.)

(c.) Other men, i.e,,  untrained men, under conditions to be determined later.     Men under (a), i.e., trained men, will enlist for a period of 2 years.   Men under (b)and (c), i.e., Cadets and untrained  men, will enlist for a period of 4 years.     6. Men who wish to become members of the special class will enlist in the territorial force under the conditions laid down in paragraph  5, and will, in addition, undertake toserve in the special class for a period of 1 year in the  first instance, with the option of extending their service in the special class year by year.                          AGE AND PHYSICAL STANDARD.     7. Men must be between the ages of 18 and 41 with the  exception  of  Cadetsreferred to in paragraph 4 (6), but  a higher age limit, i.e:, to 45,  may be allowed in  the-
case of certain specified units and of men selected for appointment as warrant officers-and non-commissioned officers of and above the rank of Serjeant.    Men  must be passedphysically fit for general service.                       ENLISTMENT FOR A PARTICULAR UNIT.     8. A man may join a unit of any arm of the Territorial Force in which a vacancyexists, and, having joined it, he cannot be  transferred  to  another unit in  peace  time without his prior consent.   If, as the result of some possible future  re-organization ofthe Territorial  Force, in order to  conform to that  of the Regular Army, the  unit towhich he has been posted on attestation becomes part of a different arm of the service,he  will be given the option of being discharged forthwith or of  completing the periodof his engagement with the  new unit,  provided  that he  has  not been permitted totransfer under the regulations in force at the time.

B. Special Class.     The liabilities for service of men in  the Special  Class  will  be such  as to enablethem to carry out their function of providing reinforcements behind the Army  Reserveon  mobilization.

APPENDIX E.RESOLUTION AND  RECOMMENDATIONS ADOPTED AT  A  RECENT  MEETING OF  A  SUB-    COMMITTEE  OP THE ARMY COMMITTEE  OP  THE  HOUSE  OF  COMMONS  ON  THE    FUTURE OF THE TERRITORIAL FORCE.                  (Extract from the Times, 19th December, 1919.)    The Army Committee of  the  House  of Commons holds  strong views  on there-organization of the Territorial Force, and it proposes to lay them before the PrimeMinister at an early date.   It is anxious to submit to him the  following resolution andrecommendations adopted at a recent meeting of its Sub-Committee on the territorial force:     While appreciating the courtesy of the Secretary of State  for War in meeting theArmy Committee, and thanking him for his frank statement, the Committee very muchregrets that he was unable to give any definite information as to the future organizationof the Territorial Force, and points out that this continued delay is very prejudicial tothe chances of recruiting, and that  the delay in establishing a second line to the RegularArmy constitutes a real danger to the Empire.    The Committee recommends that:          1. Full details of the proposed new organization and conditions of service    for the Territorial Force should be published without delay.         2. Any alteration contemplated in  the  existing terms  of service  should be    announced before recruiting is opened.         3. (a.) The  Territorial Force should be  recruited  under the old terms of    service, with the additional obligation to serve  overseas in the event of national    emergency, provided that men shall not be liable to serve abroad  except  in their    own units until a national service obligation is in force.         (b.) For the purpose of fulfilling the functions of the  Special  Reserve, officers    and men,  up to a limit of 25 per cent, of establishment, should be invited to accept    a  general  overseas obligation, to come  into effect  upon  the Army Reserve being    called up.  A reasonable  retaining fee  should be paid  both  officers  and men in    return for undertaking this obligation.         4. (a.) The Army Order  announcing the form of recognition  to be given to    those Territorials who served in the Territorial  Force prior  to  August, 1914, and    who  undertook foreign service obligations  before November, 1914,  should be    published as early as possible,  in order  to give  encouragement  to recruiting in the    new Territorial Force.         (b.) The  existing provisions for a closer relationship  between the  Territorial    units of the Regular Army and Territorial Force should be included in the scheme    for the constitution of the  Territorial Force.         5.  (a.) That  a Territorial  Force  Reserve should be formed  of all men who    have  served their engagements and are willing to join such Reserve.         (6.) That the  men  of the  Reserve  may be permitted  to  attend  the annual    training, provided that the total establishment be not exceeded.
APPENDIX F.                   ESTIMATE  OF COST OF THE PROPOSED SCHEME.     1. The provision (exclusive  of pensions) for the Territorial Force on  the old basis,,in the  Estimates of  1914-15  was 3,108,0007.,  and  the numbers  assumed  for  theEstimate were 260,000.  The  provision was  thus  about 111. 18s. ahead.  Taking intoconsideration the increased pay of officers and soldiers and the general rise of prices, thecorresponding provision for an identical force of 260,000 men at the present day wouldbe 8,080,000/., or about 31/. per  head.     2. The new scheme, with the  effectives reduced to 50  per cent, of the full newestablishment, would give a force of about  197,000 at a cost of 7,045,000/., or  about35/.  15s. a head; the chief cause of increase being the payments for drills  and bounties,over and  above the new rates of pay for officers and men.  If the  Force  were  allowedto grow to its  1914  strength of  260,000 (which was of course, considerably  belowestablishment) it would cost, on  the same lines, about 8,590,000/.&apos;     3. The proposed Special Class, if added to the  Territorial Force, supernumerary tounit establishments, would not add to the cost of the  Force in  full proportion.  It is roughly estimated that it would  cost about 44/. per head, including pay for men at therate of Is. a day throughout the  year and a 40/. retaining fee for officers.  The  numberproposed for this Special Class, on the assumption that the Army Eeserve will be ableto supply  all the requirements of the Expeditionary Force for the first 3 months of war,is 53,000.     4. The strength  required for  the  Regular  Army Reserve, to perform the  abovetask, cannot be put at less than 140,000 men, allowing for a percentage not  coming upfit for service immediately on mobilization.  The normal establishment of the Army, onthe ordinary 7  and  5  years term  of service, is not  capable  of producing  more than130,000, including  33,000 of Section  D.  [The total of 147,000  Army Reservists inexistance  in 1914 included  a  considerable number dating  from the  general  3  years&apos;enlistment scheme  which  broke down  and  had to  be  abandoned.]   At  present,with  an  unlimited  supply  of  war   veterans   who  may be  re-enlisted  in  theArmy  Reserve,   this  limit   of  numbers  does  not  operate,  but taking  the  new scheme  on  its  permanent  merits it will be  necessary to have a larger  number ofspecial class men than  53,000, and they will cost 44/.  per  head  as  compared with  19/.per head for the Army Reserve (with nay at Is. a day).     5. The comparison thus stands : Old scheme.	Numbers.	Cost in 191-1-15.	Cost to-day.. &apos; Army Reserve Special Reserve .
