TjTHE FUTURE OF THE SU?RSME ECOViOtfTC COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      The next mooting of tho Supreme Economic councils to be in Paris about January 10th.  It will be the turn of the British Government to invite the next meetingthereafter to London, and it ia therefore, necessary toobtain a definite decision as to British policy inregard to the continuance of the Supreme Economic Council.I suggest that the British Delegation should put beforethe Council a memorandum containing the following proposals:-1.   That the Supreme Economic Council should not be formally abolished but that no further plenary meetingsshould be held ponding a decision by the League of nations as to the formation of an Economic Section of the League.2.   That the Consultative Food Committee and its fivesub-committees should be continued for the present as agreed at the Home meeting and that if any questions ofpolicy arise the Consultative Food Comrlttee should ubtalninstructions direct from the Governments concerned.   Thedecision referred to is as follows - paragraph 330 -     &quot;That the Consultative Food Committee should be prolonged until the 31st August 1920.   That the sub-committees should be continued in operation so long asthe Consultative Food Committee hold their continuance tobe necessary.&quot;     It vtill probably be necessary for us to continueto be represented on the sub-committee ao Icng as the commodities dealt with are controlled.5.   That the Communications Section should be wound upas soon as possible after the Treaty comes into forceand that the various Missi -ns (which are expensive and do not appear to serve any direct British purpose) shouldbe withdrawn.4.   That the Raw Materials and Statistical Committees(which are being amalgamate^) should be continued on as modest and economical a scale as possible until ithas been decided whether their functions are to betaken over by the League of Nations.5.   That the Finance Committee should become solely responsible to the Reparation Commission if thatCommission desire ItB continuance.   (This is practicallythe cese already)*(Intld).  A.C.
