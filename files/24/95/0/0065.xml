Department, 29tli December 1919.     Secret.   Afghanistan.   Your telegram  dated  20th September.  Amirs letter tothe King.  Treaty of 9th August draws clear distinction between peace as establishedby Article 1 and future friendship  contemplated in Article  4 as outcome of furthertreaty.  His  Majesty&apos;s Government,therefore think it  would  be  inappropriate  forKing to correspond direct  with  Amir,  who is not yet even  technically a friendlypotentate.  You should therefore inform Amir that as requested by him in his letterto you, you  have forwarded his letter  for  submission to  His  Majesty,  who   hascommanded you  to  acknowledge its  receipt and  to say that to no one. more  than to himself was it a sorrow that the son of his loyal friend,  the&apos; Amir  Habibullah. Khan,should,  without warning or provocation have  waged  war upon him  and upon  hisIndian people.  The treaty of peace and Amir  Amanullah&apos;s  letter encourage   HisMajesty to hope  that when  the British and Afghan representatives meet again in afew months time it may be possible to restore the relations between the two countriesupon a secure foundation, and to renew the friendship which united them for so manyyears.   (King&apos;s message ends.)     Style of Your Majesty should not  be used.     As regards Mahmud Turzi&apos;s letter to Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs,  wethink it advisable to  maintain present  procedure regarding  communications between his  Majesty&apos;s Government  and Amir, at all events until  second treaty has been concluded.  Secretary of State for  Foreign  Affairs will not reply, and your  foreign secretary should simply inform Mahmud that his letter has been received by Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.-A
