The Board of Trade enteredinto contracts with the seven principal meat packers in thePlate for the supply of meat for the British Army from September1914;  and they were afterwards extended to cover supplies for  theirench, Italian and other Allied Armies.  The  latest-contracts were for 50,000 tons of meat per month from 1st July 1917, and ran forthe term of the war and a  period terminating three months after the signing of a &quot;definitive treaty of peace with  Germany&quot;;  they accordingly expired on 28th September last.3,     Arrangements were also made in February 1915 with theAustralian State Governments and the New Zealand Government for thepurchase of stipulated prices of their exportable surpluses offrozen meat.   Thes6 agreements expire 3 months after the officialdeclaration of the end of  the war in the  case of the australian government  and on 30th June. 1920 in the case of New Zealand.The Board of Trade have, however, already been approached withregard to the renewal of both agreements.4.     If it is decided to renew- the Plate contracts up to 30th June,1920, it will hardly be possible to refuse to  renew the arrangements with the Australian Governments, and if the Plate contracts arerenewed up to a still later date the Australian and New Zealandarrangements will have to be similarly extended.   Apart from ;his, the case for and against renewing the two classes of agreement:.s much the same and if it is decided not to renew the Plate con tracts..there is little to be said for extending the Australian and NewZealand arrangements.  The Question may therefore be discussed with special reference to  the Plate contracts.5.     The Plate Meat Companies are ready to enter into a freshcontract, and would indeed be willing for this to cover their whole exportable output, a course which for various reasons isnot acceptable;  but they are demanding a higher price for beef,though they are willing to accept Australian&apos;prices for theircomparatively small proportion oi mutton.   It is possible thatthey would be willing to reduce their demands, but the treasury are very reluctant to enter into new obligations in regard to meatpurchases abroad by the Government unless this course is absolutely necessary for the protection of supplies and prices in this country.6.     As regards supplies, the United Kingdom will always be thechief market for.froaen meat;  and the Plate firms would probably                                                          be  ,
be prepared in tins event of the removal of control tocome under an obligation to send an agreed proportion oftheir meat hers.   Moreover, wo have the controlof British insulated tonnage at present and so long as wekeep this we are of course &quot;practically safe,7t     AS regards prices   increasing competition from the overseas Dominion;..&quot;should  operate to keen prices dosn.  Itmight be thouTivt advisable to introduce some system of licensing as recommended by the Gowittee on Meat S&quot;1 &quot;ilies.8,     oome of our allies  are anxious about their supplies, asin the  )ast they have depended on British assistance for making their contracts,  rhcir claims for assistance, however,could&apos;very veil be met by  allo in/? them to negotiate contract sthrough tLe British organisation.9*    I am of opinion that it is undesirable to renev/ either,the contracts with the Plate tie at Companies or the arrangements with the Australian and New Zealand (Jovernments, since renewalwould not only entail possible loss to the Treasury, but would also postpone the resumption of normal trading conditionswithout any &quot;definite compensating advantages.A.
