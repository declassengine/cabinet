                     -8 -                             370     Lord Lee explained that the Prime Minister that morninghad  received a deputation from-a Conference ofLocal authorities of Greater London on the unsatisfactory supply, priceJ^aietribtt-ticn of mills and of coal.-  In his reply to the deputation thePrime Minister had indicated three possible courses in regardto  milk.-          (1)  to fix a maximum price,          (21  to fix a maximum price and provide a subsidy               from national or municipal funds,  or          (3) . to de-control milk and the related dairy products.The Cabinet had considered the matter (Cabinet 18 (19) Minute 6)and had appointed the present Committee,  with full powers, t*deal&apos;with it.      In the course of the discussion it  was pointed out thatthe best farmers were in favour of de-control of all dairy products.   5?hey held that milk was now being supplied very near the cost of production and any lowering of the price would tendto drive them out of the milk business altogether.  Owing to thecontrol of cream and butter it was not possible for the whole-sale rs to convert the surplus milk and if the public refused totako the surplus milk at the current&quot;price a deadlock wouldresult,    The only way out of the dilemma, it was suggested,,was to restore the free play of the market.     , :  rom the  stand point of the iiinistry of Food it was shownthat control was in fact already breaking down.  The supplyof milk .was much greater than had beer anticipated while con-sumption was normal,  except in-London* where it was slightlydown, and in the Horth where it tended to rise.  It was thedisposal of the  surplus which was threatening the system ofcontrol.  In the interests of the milk supply and in theanticipation of a shortage,  the Ministry  of Food has discouragedthe manufacture  of home butter which was  now sold at 2/6 perpound,  but which if free,  might rise to as much as 7/6.  Homebutter formed only about one-tenth of the total butter consumed.
i                                                          371                                 - 3 - If butter were decontrolled the price of imported butter would Eise somewh&amp;t in sympathy and  there would be  the  temptation to mix the two kinds and to pass  off the imported  as the home article.    The Ministry of Food had endouraged  the production of cheese and factories  were being subsidised u$. to  3/3d. per pound for cheese which was  being sold at  about half that figure..   the wholesale  milk dealers  it  was understood would not be unwilling toaccept  de-control at  the  ond of  January provided the cheesesubsidy were  continued  to  that  date,   The Government had under-taken  to take cheese  only  to the  end  of December.   The farmers,it  v/as  thought,,  would not  object to de-control because theywould hope  to recoup themselves by the sale of butter and. themanufacture of cream.       Attention was called to the references which had beenmade to a  London Milk Trust by the deputation and  to the desir-ability of  coming to some agreement with the United DairiesCompany so as  to provide that some portion of any  advantageaccruing to the wholesalers from de-control should be oassedon to the  consumers.   Unless this were done there would bean outcry against the Government for handing over  the public to be exploited by the Trust.   The Committee were informed thatthe United Dairies Company bought enough milk to supply  the.whole of London but that at present they used  ^S5$ for  cheese,and in case of de-control they would need to cover any loss oncheese through, the withdrawal of the subsidy.       The Committee decided as followrs r-           (l)  That home dairy products (milk,, cheese, butter               and cream) should he de-controlled  as from               February 1st, 1920.           (2)  That in giving effect to decision (l)  above  the               Ministry of Food should retain power to               deal with any unforeseen difficulties in  the               situation which might then arise.
(J5)   That the  Ministry of Food should ejiter Into     negotiations with tho United Dairies Company     and any other interests concerned with a     view to securing for the consunwr-e as much    advantage  as possible from any fall in the     cost of production of milk.(4)   That no Press notice should be issued at     present but early in January a notice should     be agreed upon and issued by the Minister     of Food,  the Minister of Agriculture,, and     the Secretary for Scotland.Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1S,    ^24 th December, 1919.
