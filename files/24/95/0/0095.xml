SECRET.THE FUTURE  OF CONSTANTINOPLE.    I HAVE only seen for the first time this  afternoon (4th January) the printedpaper in which Mr. Montagu, following an earlier paper on the future of Constantinople,expresses  &quot;surprise,&quot; &quot;astonishment,&quot; and  &quot;amazement&quot;  at  the  proceedings of therecent Conference at which I assisted regarding the&apos; bases of the future Treaty of Peacewith Turkey.    As a good many of his remarks rest upon what appears to me to  be  a completemisconception both of the situation and of the facts of the case, I ask leave to offer anecessarily hurried reply.  I will first deal with the allegations in his second paper.    What passed at the Downing Street Conference was as follows : M. Cleinenceaufirst stated the French  case, which at that time included the retention of the TurkishGovernment in Constantinople.  The Prime Minister, Mr.  Balfour, and I  argued the opposite case, viz,, that for withdrawal.   M. Clemenceau.remarked that the  matter wasone of great complexity and difficulty, that he had been much impressed by  the  Britisharguments, which he would carefully consider, and that he would instruct M. Berthelot,after such consideration, to  draw up the French case, to which I was invited to reply on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    M. Clemenceau had every  hope that thediscussion which was to follow would result in the common acceptance of one or the otherplan.  The suggestion  of the  two alternative plans was not  made,  as Mr. Montagusupposes, in order that  His Majesty&apos;s Government should state the two sides of thecase which are favoured by different parties  in the Cabinet.  I was  instructed to  draw up the plan for Turkish evacuation.  The French were  to  submit  theirs for  Turkishretention.    Before  leaving London, M. Berthelot  handed  to me the French plan, which has since been printed and circulated.   No one was more surprised than  myself  to find thatthe French had abandoned their position altogether, had accepted the  British argument for withdrawal, and proposed the latter as the fundamental  basis of discussion.   upon that we proceeded.  It was no part of my duty to produce a  plan with which I personally  disagreed and  which the French had given  up without the vestige of astruggle.    I  understood  M.  Berthelot&apos;s remark  at the  Foreign1 Office Conference,  as I understood  the  deliberate press  communiques  in  Paris, to mean no  more  than acharacteristic French endeavour  to thrust upon us the responsibility for a decision which will  be unpopular with  the  more Chauvinistic section of their own  people, andwhich they hope will cause us difficulties in the East.    [Here let me say what may not at first sight be apparent that  the real reason why the French would at bottom prefer the  Turk to remain in Constantinople  is this :They know that we have a profound distaste to be involved in a  repetition togetherwith them  at Constantinople of the old Egyptian  condominium at Cairo ; they feel sure that we should in time-divest ourselves of this burden, and  then they would be left atConstantinople in practical control of the Turk and of the Turkish Nationalist movement,soon to be in the ascendant,- which they would manipulate to their  advantage in every part of the Eastern world.   Herein lay the insidious danger of the original  french proposal,   to  which  even now they  would  like  to  revert.   I   earnestly  pray  mycolleagues to be on their guard against it.]    Mr. Montagu&apos;s second point is a complaint that the proposal to leave the Sultan aresidence  at Constantinople does  not  appear in  the  results  of  the  Foreign OfficeConference.  He  must,  I think, be unaware that at the Downing Street  Conference,I myself put forward this proposal, which I  described as the Vatican proposal, and that    [1919]         -                                                  .   B                  Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1920.
it was immediately and emphatically repudiated by M. Clemenceau, who said that inno circumstances would he agree to it.   He said  it had all the demerits of the proposalto leave the Turkish Government in  Europe, without a single one of the  compensatingadvantages.  If there was to be a cut, he would only agree to a clean cut.   In thesecircumstances, it was not likely that M. Berthelot would revive a. proposal which  hadbeen  so unmercifully condemned by his chief.   Neither  was it practicable  for me to repeat a proposal that was doomed to abrupt dismissal.     Mr. Montagu complains, as I understand, that, having hypothetically turned the turk out of Europe, we have shown the minimum of consideration  for him, in Asia bydepriving him of even a nominal sovereignty there, while  at the same  time  he will be&quot; without any opportunity of hearing, or inducement to listen to, our requirements and demands.&quot;   I cannot see in this description any likeness to the proposals which we have submitted.  Our object in the Foreign  Office  Conference was,  if possible, tc free theTurkish dominions in  Asia Minor from Greek or Italian or any  other foreign  territorialencroachment, but to place his  Government under so much of foreign  financial,  andadministrative  control as to ensure  that  he should not repeat there the outrageousmisgovernment of which he has for centuries been guilty in Europe.     As to Santa  Sophia, the Foreign Office Conference expressed no decided opinioneither way.   They were not  averse from leaving it as a mosque,  though  it  may beremarked that the 470  years of  modern possession  to  which Mr. Montagu points ismore than balanced by the  920 previous years of use as  a Christian Church, for whichpurpose indeed it was built.  The Conference merely advised  that if any differentialtreatment   were thought necessary,  Santa  Sophia might be  treated as  a religiousmonument, without denominational use.     Again, as  to  the  selection  of a new capital in Asia  Minor, Mr. Montagu seems tohave  found in  our Report  indications  that the  Turk  is not even to be allowed to havethe choice.  If reference be made to  the sole  and very condensed  reference to thissubject on  p. 15, it will he seen that there is no foundation for the suspicion.   I would let  the Sultan go where he pleases.   But  no suggestion of any third  alternative toBrusa aud Konia was made.     I now turn to the arguments used  by Mr. Montagu  in his  earlier paper about thefuture of Constantinople.   He has frequently reiterated them with profound convictionand with great ability.  I  will  ask leave once again to contest his  views, and then tostate the opposite  case.  If there  is  anyone who by political upbringing and traditionwould be inclined  to  favour  consideration for the Turk,  I suppose it would be myself.If there is anyone  who would ex hypothesi  desire to conciliate  Moslem opinion throughout the Eastern world it would be one who had been for many years head ofthe Government of India and  who  had spent  many  years of his life  in  travellingamongst and studying Mohammedan peoples. -And yet I remain  profoundly  of theopinion not  only  that the present  opportunity ought  to  be  taken for terminating the connection of the  Turk with  Europe, but that if it be not taken we shall be layingup  for ourselves a heritage of future  trouble,  intrigue,  and wars in Eastern Europe .which we shall  regret for generations.     Mr. Montagu quotes with emphasis the  alleged unanimity of Indian opinion.  state deliberately that this  is a  factitious unanimity, the result of a prolonged  anddesperate agitation.  I was Viceroy of India for nearly seven years, Lord Hardinge wasViceroy for five.  In our time which after all covered twelve years there was not, andthere never has been till in the last two or three years, any pronounced feeling  amongIndian Moslems in  favour of Constantinople as the seat of the Khalifate or the capital of Islam.  The  Khalif is Khalif wherever he  resides.  Whern he was in Asia Minorcenturies ago his residence was &quot; Roum &quot; to the Eastern world.  When he migrated to europe Byzantium  became  Roum.   If he  goes back to Asia Brusa or  Konia  willbecome Roum.   Constantinople has never had, and has not now,  any associations ofpeculiar sanctity or prestige  to the Indian Mohammedan     When the Balkan War took place and Bulgaria was  thought  to be on  the eve ofcapturing Constantinople, India showed no emotion. When in the early days of the warMr. Asquitlfs Government  made a secret  agreement with the  Czar&apos;s Government, inthe event  of victory over the Turk, to  hand over Constantinople to Russia, and when.this  agreement  was published  by the  Russian  Revolutionary  Party, there  was  nocommotion in India.  When on at least two occasions, to be mentioned presently, one &apos;of the published aims of the Entente Powers was declared to be  the  expulsion of the turk from  Europe, India neither protested nor stirred.     I do not doubt that between that  date and  this a great deal of feeling  has  beenaroused, and a seeming  solidarity of opinion between Moslem  and  Hindu in  India
 produced.  There will be a violent outcry if the Turk is now ejected.  But it will be, in my opinion, and I believe in the opinion  of all those who know India best, an artificial and an ephemeral explosion, which will before long die down.      Mr. Montagu has more than once cited the words of the Prime Minister, spoken in January 1918, when he was endeavouring to draw Turkey out  of the war.   But he has omitted to quote the  Reply of the Allied Powers to the note from President Wilson dated the 12th January,  1917, which was published urbi et orbi as the fixed policy of the Allies:           &quot;Their war aims are well known ....  They  imply the setting free of the     populations subject to the bloody tyranny of the  Turks; and the turning out of     Europe of the Ottoman Empire as decidedly foreign to Western civilisation.&quot;     Nor has Mr. Montagu  made  any reference to the famous  explanatory despatch of Mr. Balfour (dated the 10th  January,  1917), unanimously approved by  the British Cabinet, in which he wrote :           &quot; Evidently the interests of peace and  the claims of  nationality alike require     that Turkish rule over alien races shall if possible be brought to an  end ; and we     may hope that  the expulsion of Turkey from  Europe will contribute  as  much  to     the  cause  of  peace as  the  restoration  of Alsace-Lorraine  to Prance  or  Italia     Irredenta to Italy, or any of the other territorial changes indicated in the note.&quot;     In  the  face of these  pronouncements,  which were acquiesced in by our  Allies including America indeed, the note of the  12th  January was  drawn up and discussed in the presence of the French Ministers  in the  Cabinet Room it is not possible  to contend either that  the consequences to the Turk of an Allied victory were not fully foreseen or  that there was  any  disagreement  about  them.   The  opinion  of  the Republican Party, now in the ascendant in America, was also emphatically expressed by Senator Lodge, when he said in the Senate on the 13th August, 1918 :-         &quot; Constantinople must be  finally taken away from Turkey and placed in the     hands of the Allied nations as a free port, so as to bar Germany&apos;s way to the East,     and  hold the  Dardanelles open for the benefit  of mankind.   It  would be a     miserable outcome to have Turkey retained in Europe, a curse to her subjects and     neighbours, a plague spot and a breeder of wars.&quot;     Mr. Montagu ridicules  as ludicrous the argument that if the  Turk is  not turned out of Constantinople it will be regarded  throughout  the  East as an admission that he has  not been beaten;  and  he asks  it the Turk  loses Palestine, Arabia, Mesopotamia, and  has to acquiesce in the internationalisation  of the  Straits, will not that be  regarded as sufficient evidence of his discomfiture?  In reply, I do not hesitate to  advance as serious the argument which he treats with such scant respect.  I assert unequivocally that if the Turk, whom the  Allies have, as I have pointed out, three times declared their intention  to expel  from  Kurope as the price  of defeat is  nevertheless left in possession  of his European  capital, it will be  regarded throughout the Eastern world as convincing proof not that  the Allies  would  not, but that they could not,  evict him.   The loss  of  the  border populations,  none of them  of  Turkish  nationality, and  the majority of them held by the thinnest of ties, will not be regarded in any sense as a national humiliation.  It will only be a continuation  of the process  that has gone on for centuries, successively depriving the Turk of  Greece, Macedonia, Thessaly, Bulgaria, Crete, Egypt,  and many other possessions,  but  has nevertheless  always left him  in possession of  the capital of the Eastern  world.   Constantinople is the symbol to the  East not of spiritual predominance,  but  of  political power, and  the measure of Mr. Montagu&apos;s anxiety to keep the Turk there, in order to placate the Moslem  world, is the measure of the importance which its possession carries throughout the East.     Mr. Montagu quotes Lord Milner, whose  opinion I should be the last to disparage, and  who urges the retention of  the Turk  in Constantinople as best for us in Egypt.I, on the other hand, could  quote passages from high authorities in Egypt who holdexactly the opposite  view, and who argue that the one thing  required to convince th Egyptian that he can get no help from Europe and that his connection  with the  Turkis severed for ever will be the disappearance of his  former sovereign from the. GoldenHorn.     But if the argument from authority be pressed, I  would ask how it is that the vast majority of our Eastern  experts, the men who have  spent a lifetime in studying or     [1919]                                                                B 2
 serving  in the  Near East, are in favour of expulsion.   Even  if we take,the British officials who have served in Constantinople since  the Armistice, where  they ha e been exposed to every sort  of friendly pressure from the Turks,  and whose traditional instincts, particularly in the case of officers in the Navy, might have been  expected to inculcate pro-Turk rather than anti-Turk sentiments, I do not know of one who does not think that this opportunity of getting rid of the Turk ought not to be  lost. Admirals Calthorpe and de Eobeck, who  have been successively High Commissioners, hold that view.   So  do the, two British Political Officers at Constantinople, Mr.  Holder  and Mr. Ryan.   The former wrote in an official report as recently as November last:       &quot; The city of Constantinople is Imperial  both by its geographical  position and its historical traditions, and not in  all its annals, except in the times of the Palseologi, has it been  reduced to  such a state of impotence  and wretchedness as  now. ....  It seems unsuitable that the ruler of a third-rate kingdom in  Asia should still possess so great a capital, the very upkeep of which is beyond his means, as is  being proved at this  very time;  it  is as if a  petty landowner  whose  farms and buildings  were in complete dilapidation  should endeavour to occupy and to  maintain from family pride some noble old historic castle.  Again, if there is any certain lesson  to be derived from history,  it is that the Turk is  incapable of governing  even himself, to  say nothing of other races, and it is necessary to  go no further  than Constantinople to obtain at once abundant proof of his maladministration.     &quot; I  cannot find that there is in actual fact any real basis for the argument which has of late been advanced that Constantinople is in any way whatever a Holy City of Islam. It appears to me that there is danger of overestimating the shock to Moslem feeling at large by the expulsion of the Turks from Constantinople, and  I believe that there is great risk in reality  in leaving them there to brood over their former greatness.....&quot;     The above  passage raises a point which it is  impossible to ignore.  It is a common- place that for wellnigh four centuries the rule of the Turk has been a blight and a curse to the countries which he has misgoverned, and I know of no single good thing that the Turk has done to a single nation or community or interest in Europe.  His  presence at Constantinople has poisoned the atmosphere of Eastern Europe, everywhere spreading corruption, maLidministration, and ruin.   At Constantinople he has always been able to set the Powers by the  ears, to  embroil  Governments and nations, and to inoculate the West with the worst vices of E istern intrigue.  From there  he has ordered the massacres of hundreds of  thousands of his  Christian  subjects.  Constantinople in his hands has been, and if left there will remain, a plague-spot of the Eastern world.     There are two other aspects of the  case to which I must allude.  Mr. Montagu has drawn a picture of the  unrest  in  the Eastern world that will spring from a sullen and embittered Islam.  Personally I think that if we  rob the Turk of Smyrna we shall do more to fan the flame of racial religious  animosity in  Turkey in Asia  than by any steps that we might take with regard to Constantinople ; and my colleagues may have noticed in all the reports that have  come to us from our authorities, notably in General  Milne&apos;s despatch of the 20th October, that has been circulated to the Cabinet that there is  not a dissentient voice about Smyrna.   But my point is this : If we have to face, as I think we probably shall, a  new form of Turkish nationalism, whether it be founded on religion or on race, or whether it be Pan-Islamic or Pan-Turanian, will it&apos; be a more or  a less formidable factor if its rallying point  and inspiration is the Sultan  at  Constantinople rather than a Sultan at Brusa ?  Will not the retention of the old capital give a prestige and an impetus  to  the. movement which will add  immensely  to its potentiality for harm?   A Nationalist  Party in Anatolia under  Mustapha Kamal  may be a hard nut to crack.  But a Nationalist  Party with its Sovereign at Constantinople, even if his forts and warships have disappeared, will be a much more anxious problem.     Lastly, ought we not to look to the  future ?   Constantinople has been for centuries, ever since a Roman  Emperor moved  his capital  there, the prize of the  Eastern world. To this day its possession is coveted by France, Greece, Russia, and I daresay Bulgaria. How are we to  prevent  it from  becoming  once more the prey of rival  ambitions and the  cockpit  of future struggles, except  by putting  it  under  international supervision now ?  If we leave the  Sultan there,  what  is  to  prevent the German from  recommencing  his old intrigues  ?   Will  not the  Bulgarian and  the  Greek be condemned to a rife-long rivalry ?  Will not  a resuscitated Russia once again look to the Bosphorus for the gratification of her secular  ambitions?  Let us suppose thatyou have a combination  between the Bolshevik, assuming him to be victorious in Russia,and  the Turk, assuming him to be left as Sovereign in  Constantinople let us suppose
 what is by no means unlikely that a recovered Germany once again takes a hand inthe game what is to prevent the repetition at some future date, perhaps in a more dangerous form, of the experience of 11)14-15 ?  Finally and here I repeat a warningalready given what  is  to  prevent France  from  assuming the  r61e  of  championof  the new  Islam,  and  organising  the  Moslems of  the  Western  World  fromMorocco to Syria against the Moslems  of the  East, ie., Mesopotamia, Arabia, Persia,Afghanistan, and India.  I cannot  imagine a greater danger to the peace of  the worldthan  a division between French and British Islam, of which I do not think  that I amfanciful in seeing the omens already above  the horizon.  I call attention to the fact thaton his recent return journey from Syria,  M. Picot, the French High Commissioner, andno friend of ours, went out of his way to visit Mustapha  Kemal at Sivas.    The conclusion of my argument is that in spite of the immediate risks involved inthe policy of expulsion which in my judgment will have  to be  encountered anyhow,whether we keep the Turk in Europe or  bid him go the longer view  demands that weshould not sacrifice the opportunity presented to us by  the defeat of an  enemy whoseentrance into the war prolonged it for at least two years and cost  us millions of treasureand tens of thousands of lives, to settle  once and  for all a question  which more than any single cause has corrupted the political life of Europe for nearly 500 years.                                                                     -c. OF K.    January 4, 1920.o
