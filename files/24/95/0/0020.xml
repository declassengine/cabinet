On  the  other hand, the resolution shown by the dockers  in their demands may lead to a strike.      There is a good deal of dissension among the railwaymen: the extremists oppose representation  of their Union on the Advisory Board.      The fact that the miners are conducting an extensive nationalisation oampaign points  to  the fact that they are still divided on the question, though  probably  the majority is in favour of nationalisation.      The Independent Lebour Party has issued a manifesto defining its attitude towards  the Soviet  form of Government and direct action.  Quotations from  this are  given.      profiteering, housing and unemployment are causing grave discontent.   Ihe  cost of milk  has provoked a demand for the aunioipalisation  of the milk  supply.   The high prioes are said to be driving members of the middle olass into the ranks of  the . Labour Party.   The building operatives are beginning to ask  for^representation  on the Housing  Committees  and for a government subsidy/ 1 I 3 4 4 6 6 7 8 9111315151616181818
subsidy for themselves in the form of wages,  The profiteer-ing spirit seems to heve seized upon them also.     The Lancashire worker is indignant at the accusationthat he is wilfully restricting output, but in the samebreath he points to the high profits made by the employer andthe small portion of it whioh oomes to him.  This idea hasbecome an obsession with the working man.
EkJUMMM^IMJ^LTM. WTO          There&apos;is evidonoe from all parts  of  the  oountry     that the miners&apos;  campaign will be strenuously conducted:     numerous demonstrations are being arranged,   Messrs.     F, Braialoy,  P. Eodges and J.S. Miridleton,  the joint     secretaries  of the &quot;Mines for the Nation  Campaign     Committee&quot;&apos;,  set up by the Trade Union  Congress, the     Labour Party and  the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain,     have issued  a manifesto and leaflets are  being printed     for free distribution,  I am informed  that it is     extremely difficult to obtain halls for meetings as     they have been booked for weeks ahead  by  Labour     organisations,          The enti-natlonalization campaign is still in     progress in  Wales but if one body of miners passes a     resolution condemning the principle, a far larger body     usually repudiates their action,  A case  in point     occurred at Ystrad i&amp;rnaoh, the numbers being, against     nationalization 300, for 1500.  At the same time it is     obvious that tho  loaders would not expend money and     energy on this campaign if the miners  were unanimously     in favour of nationalization,M.B RATLWAYME3T          The railway situation has been somewhat  oleared     by tho authoritative statement of Mr,  Thomas  to the     effect that the Executive had no intention of calling     a strike and that he considered that  the  latest     Government offer contained &quot;the germ  of a settlement,&quot;     At the same time, the fact that many  branches are     clamouring for a speedy settlement of standardisation     and for an increase in wages  must not be overlooked.          The Advisory Committee sohome was severely     criticised at a meeting hold on December  13th at  the     Memorial Hall.  Mr. C.T, CrampMr.  G.D.H. Cole,                                                  oo-caltor/
oo-editor of the &quot;Guildsman1&apos;, Mr, W, Craik, of theCentral Labour College, and Mr. W, Mellor, Industrialeditor of the &quot;Daily Herald.&quot;, were the speakers andMr. 0&apos;Leary, Chairman of the London Distriot Councilof the National Union of riailwaymen, presided; about300 delegates were present.  The meeting was, in effect,a fiasoo, because it was called with the intention ofdemanding oontrol of the railways and ended with an admission tfcrat the railwaymen lacked the necessaryQualities to assume control.  None of the speakersfavoured the Advisory Committee soheme and Crampstated his belief in a form of national, looal andshop or yard oontrol.  Mellor, who had a mixedreoeption, expressed the opinion that profiteering wasnot the making of excess profits but the making ofany profit.  -He taunted the railwaynen with theirmultiplicity of unions and declared that unity wasunattainable in Unity House.  His objeotion to.&quot;toomuoh General Secretary&quot; was applauded.     The resolution, &quot;That this meeting demands thewithdrawal of our representatives, -Messrs. Cramp andThomas, from the Advisory Board&quot;, was defeated, but aresolution was oarried unanimously demanding thenationalization of the railways and a Board of Controlconsisting of representatives from Parliament and fromthe railwajnnen.  It was resolved to decline any sohemewhioh does not provide for full  control of all transport industries by the workers.     On November 30th, a conference of the CentralCounties - Essex, South Eastern, Southern and London -Distriot Councils was held in London; the Press wasexcluded.  He commendations to the following effect                                            were/
were considered;--          That there should be closer co-operation     between the. different Councils of railwaymen;     that the Federation should consist of three     delegates from eaoh Counoil, under the name     of the &quot;South of England Federation of District     Councils.&quot;          (That a central Strike Committee be set up     for the London area, which shall remove to     Chatham immediately an official strike is     deolared.          That explanatory leaflets should be issued    ; before and during.a strike, if possible while     the train services are still running.          That the Strike Committees should inolude     v/ives of strikers, and that some of the indoor     meetings should be held for women only.          That the Counoil should be responsible for     finanoing all work carried out on its behalf     during the strike.THE DOCKET     The olaim of the National Transport Workers&apos;Federation to a national standard minimum of 16s. per day for dock workers will be discussed at a oonferenoe with theNational Counoil of Dock and Waterside Employers onDeoember 18th.  Both sides are apparently adamant, and asthe bookers1 &quot;are relying upon the support of the TripleiVlliahoe the issue is becoming serious.     I am informed that in oonsequenoe of the campaign against non-union labour in Liverpool the percentage of  ;men outside the dockers&apos; Union is not higher than 6,    &apos;The new entranoe fee has given rise to very bitter feeling.In this ooiineotion a correspondent sends the following report:          &quot;The imported Irish (Sinn Feiners) seem    &quot;to be able to get work at the Dooks, although    &quot;the joining fee is ao high,          &quot;Several intelligent Dock labourers state    &quot;that it is easy for these Irishmen to join the Union,    &quot;as the delegates along the line of Docks, except about    &quot;three, are Irishmen and the majority of foremen at                                                  the/
           &quot;the various docks are Irish too; the dockers allege  I           &quot;also that the delegates reoeive baokhanders from           &quot;the Irishmen seeking to join the Union or from           &quot;their friends, so as to obtain a olearing house           &quot;Tally, of whioh they must be in possession before           &quot;they oan get a job at the Docks: afterwards they           &quot;are Quietly supplied with a Union button.  The           &quot;Union balanoe sheets are never asked for by the           &quot;members, so the delegates appear to have the matter           &quot;entirely in their own hands.&quot;PROFITEERING           The growing unrest, which is due to the high oost of      living, seems to be centring itself in the question of      milk supply.  There seems to be a growing demand for the      munioipalieation of milk, which, of course, is      exactly what the extremists in the Labour world are aiming      at.  It is stated that the high oost of living is      bringing a large number of people in the Middle and Working      classes to join the Labour Party.THE HOUSING- ^ESTIQN           Tentative experiments are being discussed at Norwich,      Swansea and ^foondda towards the erection of houses by      Municipalities contracting directly with building operatives      The Swansea labour Association want to give the operatives      a  voice in the management anal in the selection of foremen,      etc.   It appears that under the Swansea housing scheme a      contract haa been made with a Cardiff firm for the      erection of 150 houses,  but the men have  deolined to forego      a  olause in the contract, forbidding  subcontracting.  -The      contractors have no joinery works  of  their own and propose      to let out  the joinery to a local  firm working under fall      Trade  Union  conditions.  As  the men have  taken up this      attitude  the  contractor  has posted notices  that he  oannot                                                        carry/
Ma K &quot;*carry out the contract.  At dhondda, the Counoil is considering a suggestion that six or more houses shouldbe erected by direot labour, and that it should withdraw 30,000  invested in War Loan and apply the money tothe housing scheme,     Trade unionists in Bo 1 ton, Wigan, Bury end otherparts of Lancashire are considering what attitude they.shall take towards the Government subsidy.  They saythat they were badly hit before the war, that their wages were barely sufficient for a living, and that now thatthey have m opportunity for recovering lost ground theyhave more claim to a subsidy than the ivaster Builders,and that they ought to have representatives on the HousingCommittees.  Their view is that the first houses ereotedshould be allotted to ex-Service men and then to workerswith large families, aid,, of course, like everyoneelse in these days, they blame the Government for thedelay.     At Blackpool there is great discontent amongst theboarding-house keepers, many of whom have reoeived notioeato quit, beoause the- owners wish to convert their housesinto shop property,1 a Tenants&apos; Protection Sooiety is being formed.     A correspondent from Barrenin-Furaess sends me thefollowing report:-          wWe have two local builders who had plane out     &quot;for streets before the war.   The ground is drained     &quot;and streets made, and they are anxious to go on     &quot;building,  dfoe Government, for some reason, are     &quot;holding up brioks and material, of which we have     &quot;an abundance here, and I am afraid if the facts get     &quot;known there will be trouble.  The need of housing     &quot;is undeniable and the Government hold three million     &quot;bricks four miles from here and the docks are     &quot;jammed full of wood,&quot;     A correspondent in Glasgow attributes the increase in                                            drunkenness/
      DRONKHNNAS3 to the lack of housing facilities.           Extremists assert that the present high prices of      materials are due to the nefarious proceedings  of a      &quot;building ring&quot;.THE jqp^ffiO^TO DONATION           The stream of protests against the withdrawal of the      dole seems to point to the need for speeding up tho Bill      to extend&apos;Part&quot;&apos;II of the National Insuranoe: Aot.  There      seem to be genuine cases of distress, caused in some      instances by the&apos;congestion of transport;&quot;Ahy measure      which would relieve such oases would have an effect upon      industrial unrest; :-              ,,,v.;.HESTJrtlCTION OF  OUTPUT           %-Liverpool correspondent, reports that the average      Lancashire worker doescnot  believe that there is any wide-      spread polloy  of  &quot;oa^Cannyism&quot;  by the, workers generally.      At the same  time  they  think it unreasonable to  expect them      to work  &quot;like  niggers&quot;  to make good the financial  losses,:.    of the war,&apos; .:.!Ehey point to  the,profits  that are being made      and  ask  how  huge fortunes  oould be piled up.if  we  were      a nation, of  indifferent workers,.;  The  lower paid operatives      speoially consider  that they  are working a good deal harder      at present than is  reasonable. ;           At  the  same time,  a large number  of instances oan  be      cited  in coal mining,  engineering and  dock labour whioh      shows that there is  a policy of restriction of  output,      applied  sometimes by the local Union representative by      direot order or indix-ect threat, and sometimes by the      men  themselves.&quot;&apos;  This, is speoially marked  in the matter of  ^   discharging ships?  for at Cardiff and  elsewhere the      machines are deliberately kept working below their full                                                           epeed/
speed.  The fact is that it has got into the minds of mostworking men that their employers are making extravagantprofits, and that they are not getting a fair share of the wealth they are producing, and that If so they do not see    why they  ahould  bestir  themselves until they get a larger    share.  Many of  them seem  determined, as soon as the present   : agreement expires  in April next, to  demand a substantial    advance in wages,         ;The  dyeing  and textile  trades,  which are nearly all   : on piece  work,  seem to  be  free&quot;from  any restriction of  output,BA&amp;fcW^IN-KM-SSff          Barrow, which earned  some  notoriety in  the middle  period     of the war,and  has sinoe been quiescent, is  now again in a     ferment over the question  of evictions.  % Tenants&apos; Defenoe     League, whioh was formed to.protect;working class  tenants,     is resisting by, force an ejection1order issued  by  the     Borough Justices  against a man named V/iIIiam! Lowry.  Headed     by Councillor Bramwell LongstaffeV a local revolutionary     who served a term of imprisonment during-the wor,  the League     mountea guard over Lowry &apos;s house from December 5th to  the     8th.   The warrant was  exeouted by the Folios on the 9th,     but the orowd overpowered the; Police, foroed&apos; the door of the     house  and replaced part of  the furniture.   Three local     Councillors, two of  them members of  the local watch Committee,     were present when the  League was formed.  In their presence a     man named  Thomas Morton, another local revolutionary,  stated     that if he  oould o btain volunteers  he would stop the Polioe     from executing ejectment  orders, and if the execution was     prooeeded with he would put/ the evicted tenants into the houses of the justi&apos;OE3 who signed the warrants.An/
          Jm indication of tho feeling in  Barrow was given     when Mr. yeddon,  M.P., addressed a patriotic meeting on     Deoember 4th; he was refused a hearing,  the Prime     minister&apos;s name was hissed, and the &quot;iied Flag&quot; was sung,FEELINO Att(MQ9T EX-SERVICE MEN          As a result of the inability of the Prime Minister     to meet a deputation from the Discharged Soldiers in     Birmingham, there is a great deal of unrest among them.     The men say that the Prime Minister reoeives deputations     from bodies? less representative than they, and that in     his reply there was no disposition to meet the demands     of the Federation.   Ihe National Union of Ex-service Men     in Birmingham is protesting against the proposal to     erect a &quot;Hall of Memory&quot; costing  300,000.  They are     starting a propaganda campaign, urging that the money     should  be spent on the erection of a suburb for ex-soldier     and their families.          In spite of his uncompromising attitude on the     subject of admitting.ex-soldiers  to the Union, Mr. Tom     Mann is now  throwing out feelers  towards  them  by saying     that the interests of the  ex-soldier and  the worker are     identical,   There is, however, a  feeling  at  Woolwich     that the Amalgamated Sooiety  of Engineers is  treating     soldiers sourvily,          Raymond Lefebre, Vioe-President  of  the  republican     Association  of Ex-Soldiers, of Paris, has sent an     invitation,  through  the  &quot;Daily Herald&quot;,  to British     ex-Servioe men  to attend a Conference of  French,  British     and Italian  soldiers in  Paris.                                                 The/
The International Union of Ex-Service Men is daily sinking more deeply into a morass of debt and impotence.

Mr. J. Trevelyan, of London, a national organizer, outlined a scheme for an organization to be called the "Veterans Commerce Coy. Ltd."; this, he said, was a commercial enterprise, with membership limited to ex-Service men who were (or became) members of the Federation and to members of the Regular Forces.

The object of the Company was to finance its shareholders in any business project in which they were interested. It aimed at setting up an ex-Service man in business for which he showed some ability and he would have capital of £70,000 behind him. By becoming shareholders, members would therefore assist throughout the country those who had responded to the call.

Mr. Trevelyan then announced that owing to the Prime Minister&apos;s refusal to meet a deputation of ex-Service men, it had been arranged to hold a National demonstration in London, on 17th January, 1920, when a march would be made to Downing Street to demand that a deputation be received. It was, therefore, agreed that although delegates could not be sent, all Northern Branches should forward a telegram on that date to the Premier, expressing their co-operation with their colleagues.



CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE TRADE UNIONS

Evidence as to working arrangements between these two bodies continues to accumulate.

In Rochdale the manager of a Co-operative Society which has about 17,000 members and 40 branches, informed my correspondent that the Trade Unions have placed a guarantee at/


at the Co-operative Stores Bank which will  enablestrikers to obtain food by a system of vouohers,vouchers are for  10s. and 2s. 6d.; the former mayolassed as a loan from the Union , over and  above 8pay:  the recipient will sign ah agreement  to refmthe amount at the rate of 5s* a week on&apos;resumptionwork.  The 2s.  6d. vouohers will be a froe  gift innecessitous oases.      *       -;     ? :::     The yeoretary of the other-Cooperative Sooietin^toohdaie, which has about 22^^00 members and 60branches, stoted  that the-Trade Unions had  plaoed1money in Co-operative Societiest Benksvand  had plaia security with the Societies,which would ,  in the cof a strike, enable the strikers to ^obtain  food,added.that no preference would be given  to  strikersas long as any  members could pay, ,they would reoeitfood.  These TWO  statements seem incompatible asstrikers would  obviously receive t supplies whioh weimerely guaranteed and not paid for in cash. He den;that Op-operative 3ooieU,es aro supporting  Xjaboux,     In .Bury the wife of one of the Ironmoulders1Secretaries informed my correspondent that  the vouchad been a  &quot;god-send&quot; to the strikers.     The Plymouth Co-operative Sooiety found durinthe railway strike they had not sufficient  stocks;are therefore enlarging their warehouses and layingextra supplies.    ; It is reported that Trade Unions&apos; in Devonpoxttransferring their funds to  the Co-operative Sooi*Bank.     iiegarding  the request made by the south ShielJbranoh of the Co-operative Sooiety for payment  of50$ of the  debt incurred through  issue of grooeriel                                                to/1
0 Ato the ironmoulders, a meeting was- held between theSouth Shields Branch Strike Committee and theCo-operative Committee, when it. was explained to thelatter that the agreement between the Unions&apos; Executivesand the Co-operative wholesale Sooiety provided for asettlement within three months after resumption ofwork.  The Co-operative Committee agroed to this.THE INDEPENDENT LABOUR P/utTY          This party is probably the most aotive in  the     Kingdom, and, in view of its increasing influence,     interest attaches to the memorandum on its attitude     to Bolshevism and Direct Aotion, whioh will be  submitted     to the International Sooialist Congress at Geneva in     February next.  The following are exoerpts from the     more important passages:               &quot;The Soviet form of government is not the          beatfcoaa for an industrial Demooraoy, though it          may be a very efficient revolutionary form.  It          narrows political issues till they are falsified.        &apos;  If the Soviets are to administer in the general          interests of the industrial community, they must          be elected by the bodies representing that interest          and not by mere trade or professional interests.          Otherwise the electors vote for a man as an          engineer or a miner, etc., and he governs as a          oitizen.  The Soviet form eludes, does not solve,          the problem.  The Socialist elector whose          intelligence is equal to building up the Socialist          State must vote as a oitizen and not merely as a          workman belonging to a certain trade, and with a          full knowledge.of all that Socialism means.                &quot;The  direot representation of industrial          interests  should be provided for  by  industrial          bodies  representative of  the workshops, mines,          etc , whioh  should have a  large measure of power          in  determining  legislation and  be in  the closest          touoh with State administration,  but whioh should          not be  the basis  of a politioal  constitution,                &quot;The Soviet system necessitates a method          of indirect eleotion,  so  that  the central          governing authority has no direot responsibility          to the  people  for its  acts,                &quot;The elimination  of  the  bourgeois parasitic          class will take plaoe  by  eoonomio means as we          approaoh Sooialism, and  It oannot be done           effeotually in any other  way.   what has happened          in Hussia has been done  in a  country where eoonomicstructure
struoture was smashed by war and by revolutionand under famine conditions, and how it would have worked under any other conditions it is impossibleto say,     &quot;It is short-sighted polioy to follow oh  thelines pursued in revolutionary .tussia, for three main reasons:     (a)  V/e do not know the faots in sufficient           detail.     (b)  The Soviet system .seems itself to be           undergoing changes of some importance,           owing to experience in its working,     (o)  Tho conditions under which it has been           established are altogether abnormal.     &quot;During a revolution there must be arevolutionary organisation, but InternationalSocialism must not assume that suoh an organisation should be adopted as the ordinarystructure of government.  Therefore, whilst itshould refuse to condemn revolutionary governments for departing from the rules and policies whichmust characterise the working of the SooialistState, the International ought to make it dear  tothe whole world that tiocialism under normalconditions is not to be worked by the methods whichrevolutions may make temporarily neoessary ....     &quot;The question of &apos;Direot Action&apos; is beingwidoly discussed in Great britain to-day.  Itsmore thorough advocates olaim that Parliamentaryaction has not only failed, but must always fail;its more thorough opponents oondemn it as being^constitutional1 and anti-Parliamentary,  Theposition of toe Indepenc3ent Labour Party is neitherthe one nor the other.  Its view is that to theSooialist its relative merits of industrial andpolitioal action must be considered not for thepurpose or abandoning the one or the other, butfor giving to each its proper place in a fullattaok all along the line&apos; by Democracy uponCapitalism.  It is insistently pointing out  ,that &quot;Direct action&quot; for political purposes is essentially different in its nature from &quot;DireotAotion&quot; for industrial purposes, and that the risks of failure of the former are so great thatits politioal practicability is slight.  The.threats and fearn of &quot;Direot Aotion&quot;, taken along with a general state of working-class unsettlementsuch as exists to-cay, ,do, however, oontributematerially to the influences whioh curb thepolioy of reactionary Governments,  The Party,therefore, rejeots &quot;Direot Action&quot; as a substitute for Parliamentary action, but considersit as one of the several weapons whioh the reaction may compel the working olasaes to use.Thuc used, it may be regarded a? a meano of restoring representative government, not of destroying it.&quot;THE/
THE CATHOLIC         There have of late been instances of olergymen    giving aotive support to Labour, and in some oa3es this    is doubtless all to the good.  There is, however,  an    exoeption whioh raises the question of the latitude    whioh oan be given to men protaoted by the Church,         The .I verend Conrad Noel, &quot;Chaplain-General&quot;  of    the Catholic Crusade, is tho vioar of Thaxted, a living    belonging to the Countess of Warwick,  He is an avowed    revolutionary end addresses periodical meetings in London,    Usually at Chandos Hall.  On December 15th his subjeot was    &quot;involution in England&quot;,  He said that the literal meaning    of revolution was the overthrow of the existing form of    Government, whether in England,or elsewhere; he hoped all    present were anxious to see  it an accomplished faot.    Bevolution may be accomplished by either a bloody or a    peaceful means, but he, as a bloodthirsty revolutionist,    did not trouble very much how a revolution oai&amp;e about    as long as it was accomplished.  The present system of    Government in *England must  be destroyed root and branoh;    the axe muct be used very low. down in  the roots and not    half way up the tree.   The  devils at  the head  of affairs    here are of no importance.   There is no.freedom in the    country,&apos; neither  is  there justice.  All God-fearing people    in this country should  unite and overthrow  their rulers.    Direot action was the  only  means by which workers oo&amp;ld    emancipate themselves.         The  object of the  Crusaders, is  best  explained by    their  own literature;  their aim 13  &quot;To encourage  the    rising of the people in the might  of the  r&amp;sen Christ                                                   and/
and the Saints, mingling heaven and earth that we mayshatter this greedy world to bite and remould it closer to the heart&apos;e desire,&quot;  They deoree that propagandashall be carried out,     conversation, work in the tradunions, olubs, workshops, by discussions in the oomrade*ship of the public house ...... individual letters,letters to the Press, pilgrimages, strikes, eto.&quot;  Theyaffirm that          &quot;The source of all authority is Ood     expressing Himself more remotely through the   -  race, and more immediately through the     Catholic Demooraoy, and not through a rioman     Pope, an English Autooraoy of Bishops, a King,     or any other official, excepting where these     are aoting as the mouthpiece of the whole.     The present industrial system being based on     the mortal sin of avarice, and enslaving the     people by means of rent, interest, and wagery,     must be destroyed at the roots, and any     attempt to make it more tolerable through     social reform, welfare work or  1 doin^-good-to-     the-poor&apos; will be exposed by the Crusade as     essentially vioious.&quot;     This curious mixture of religion and socialism runsthrough all Noel&apos;s speeohes.  He usually draws a parallebetween Christ and Lenin, maintaining that Christ was  thgreatest revolutionary of all  time and that the revolutlof some 2000 years ago, when Christ  routed the oppressorand profiteers  of his  time, has  its  counterpart in Aiflsito-day.      It may  be mentioned  that  Koel has publioly disobeyethe orders  of  the  Bishop  of Chelmsford in  eoolesiastioftlmatters.      A report  of his  speeohes  has  been sent  to the Bishop of  Chelmsford  and  to.the  Direotor of  Publio Proseoutions.                                            THE/

On: December 8th George Lansbury wrote to Price &quot;Your brother sent us the 10,000 the other day, for which we are very grateful/ The extent of his gratitude may be measured by the faot that the only inducements the &quot;Daily Hex-aid&quot; oan afford to make in connection with the.Development Fund are &quot;six splendid book prizes&quot; for the biggest &quot;Christmas Box&quot; oolleotiona.      Aooordlng to Mr.-. Bevin&apos;s speeoh at the Trade Union Congress last week, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; has, until recently, been losing  1,700 per week.      A pamphlet oalled &quot;Direct Action&quot;y an outline of Workshop and 3ooial organisation, by William Gallaoher and J.^, Campbell, has just been published by the National Council, 3oottish Workers&apos; Committee.

Campbell took part in the              and  &apos;Glasgow  riots/glories in being a &quot;Bolshevik.&quot;      Ihe pamphlet claims that inoreased-production isonly a means  by whioh the workers are to produoe $creatorwealth in order to liquidate the Capitalists&apos; war (Jebt.If the Capitalists cannot induoe the workers to increase production then they will use their eoonomio power toforoe the workers to do So.  They demand that brain andmanual workers  in industry shall manage the industryin which they work.  Capital has, during the last 70years,  been  consolidating, with  the oonsequenoe  thatCraft Unionism  is impotent against it, and the only way to fight it  is  by workshop Committees.  The writerssupport the  idea of  a General Staff for Labour,  but a General  itaff responsive  to  the  rank and file.      With reference  to  strikew  they claim  that passive strikes.must give way  to  the active strike, consequently the workers  must create organisation  to oounter  the State organisation  of Capitalism.   This.is to  be done by organising the workers in the place they live in  as well as in the plaoe where they work.   This would  be done.by a dooial Committee who would  collect money from workers not on strike. establish depSts  for receiving gifts of food,  arrange.for boarding out strikers&apos; children and bring pressure upon the co-operatives  to assist by supplying food to  the strikers as  they realize that the weak point in all strikes is the food  supply.  At the same time, the ;joolal Committee will take an inventory of the industries in the                                            neighbourhood/
     neighbourhood in whioh  it  is  operating.  If the workers     are going to acquire the control  of  industry,  then it     is necessary thtt  they  should know all the facts about     the industries which they  are going  to oontrol.  It  is     realized that the  transition  from Capitalism  to Communism     involves vast changes in all  social  relationships, and     oannot be accomplished  by  the waving of a magio wand.     So the &quot;exploiters11 will have to  be  held under and the     greater the repreeaive  power  of the  workers,  the feebler     will be the resistance  of  the ex-Capitalists  and the     more smooth and speedy  will the transition become.          On December 12th Kyriakos  Mikhail, a British     protected subject, was  deported to Egypt for  stirring     up trouble amongst the  Egyptians  and for circulating     libellous statements regarding  British troops, partioularlj     in the &quot;Egyptian Circular&quot;, of  whioh he was editor.     An examination of  his papers  shows that he constantly     met extremists in  this  oountry  and that Penner Brookway,     editor of the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and an associate of the     Indian revolutionary, Saklatvala, was oonoerned probably     as author in the publication  of the  libels.THE irfI3H MOVflMEOT IN mQLHSD          In London, Glasgow and Liverpool, Irish  extremists     are working hard,  but it  is doubtful whether  the violent     nature of their speeches  really helps their oause.     Enthusiasm amongst their  Irish  followers is,  however,     maintained, as is  proved  by the fact that at  a meeting     of the Paddington  Branch  of the 3elf-Determination   .

M 19 -     The strike of motor drivers over tho permit questioncontinues, but is not having a great effeot.   The fundsat the disposal of the strikers, in spite of  the aid ofthe Irish Transport and General Workers&apos;  UNION,  are small.  A good teal of dissension within  their own ranksis reported.  Also some trouble lately arose  between theAmalgamated Sooiety of Engineers and the  Mbtormen&apos;8 unionowing to members of tho latter having been found repairingoars in the owners&apos; yards whilst the workshop fitters wereidle.  The Amalgamated Society of Engineers thereforesent a warning that suoh work must stop or the supportof the Engineers would be withdrawn.  Taking  the situation as a whole it seems that the strike will  fiz2le out ifleft alone.     ft.ere is little activity observed in Sinn FeinClubs,  Any work that they are doing is said  to be mostlyin connection with electioneering, and money is badly needed to keep propaganda going.  In U.8.A, De Valera&apos;organisation is now known as the Amerioan Commission onIrish Independence, but great secrecy is maintainedregarding the aims and otyjeots  of this organisation.     it is  reported that Miss Connolly, a daughter  ofthe  late  James  Connolly, who is  employed  in a dairy inthe  London  District,  is now attached to  the Herald  Leagueas a Socialist  Leoturer.
