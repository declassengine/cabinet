SUMMARY.   This month there have been indications that the lever of unrestthroughout the world is spending itself.   The defeat of the Socialists in the French Elections was remark-able, and  it  will  surprise no  one  to  hear  that the  ConfederationGeneral e du  Travail wishes to force a  general strike  in  order to counteract their losses at  the Elections.   Though the Socialists gained a good many seats in Belgium, thelabour situation there is on the whole satisfactory, and no danger ofa revolutionary outbreak  is imminent.   In  Switzerland,  Bolshevism is  not  indigenous;  the  federal government  recognises this  and is taking action against foreignseditionists.   The success of  the Socialists in Italy seems to have been due tothe apathy of the  voters, of whom  only  half  went to the  poll.Although the majority of the new  Socialist  Deputies  are committed to extreme measures, an immediate revolutionary outburst is unlikely.D&apos;Annunzio is losing  popularity, and it would not be surprising ifhe joined with Signor Nitti in  a combat with the Socialists.   In  Scandinavia there are signs of a reaction against Bolshevism.   The two currents of  opinion in Germany have undergone little change during the month.   The rumours of  Spartacist outbreakscontinue,  and the  Independent  Socialists  have  declared   theiradherence to  the  Moscow International.  The Monarchist Party,though numerically weak,  seems to  be beginning  a propaganda campaign.   All reports go to show  that the Communist Oligarchy in russia is staking everything on obtaining recognition  as a Government and making peace.  For this purpose the British prisoners  in  their handsare being used by Litvinoff as  an instrument  for political blackmail.With the failure of General Udenitch and Admiral Koltchak, the red army is throwing all its weight against General Denikin; but it wouldnot be wise to assume that its successes in South Russia will continue,for it has also to cope with peasant and workmen&apos;s risings behind itand its own moral is maintained  with increasing difficulty.   Thereis good reason for believing that behind all the cock-crowing in the wireless messages the Communists feel that their days are numbered.   A  new  Government  has  been formed  in  Poland,  where  thediscontent appears to be due chiefly to the economic difficulties.   In Southern Spain the lock-out continues. .&quot; According to Mr. Tom Mann, the labour extremist, a rising was expected in Egypt on the 13th, and  it was then  intended to  floodthis  country  with  Nationalist propaganda.  The Egyptian Copt,Kyriakos  Mikhail, who  has been  circulating libels against Britishtroops, was  deported  to  Egypt last  week.   Among his papers  were found  letters  indicating  that  the libels had been written by Mr.Fenner Brockway, the anti-conscriptionist, or one of his friends.     The  existing Government in  Austria  seems  to be powerlessoutside Vienna, but the Communist  parties are not considered to bea serious menace.  The Monarchists  are not making progress un austria, and in Hungary, where they are stronger, there is a tendency to await events.
CONFIDENTIALA Review of Revolutionary Movements in Foreign               Countries, December  1919.                          PART I.   France. The elections brought about a loss to the Socialists of nearly 50 per cent, of  their strength in the Chamber, and Renaudel,ex-leader  of  the Socialist Party  in  the  Chamber, Jean Longuet,Mayeras  and Brizon lost  their seats.   The result was a completetriumph  for  M.  Clemenceau and  the &quot; Bloc National,&quot; and proved that the  middle  and lower middle class  electors did not  favour theprospect  of a Bolshevik-Socialist  Government.  In the final  stages of the elections  the  Socialists were out-manoeuvred in the field of propaganda  and  made their position worse by wild  speeches anddisorderly behaviour.   The Socialists, who had hoped  for  considerable  gains, were againdisappointed by the results of the recent Municipal Elections, which showed little change in the pre-war situation, the Republican Partybeing returned to power  with a strong body of  Socialists as theopposition.   In view  of  their  defeat  at  the polls,  it is likely  that  the extremists will now direct their energies to promote trouble in theindustrial world.  In  a  recent  interview  M.  Jouhaux, Secretary ofthe Confederation Generale du Travail, who has been  attending theInternational Labour  Conference  at Washington, expressed anxietyat the growing influence of the violent sections of the  ConfederationGenerale du Travail.  In  his  absence in  America, the confederation-tion Generale ,du Travail,  in accordance with the programme whichwas accepted at the recent Labour Congress at Lyons, announces thecreation of an Economic Labour Council which will have  the assist-ance both of  consumers and skilled workers.   This  Council is to takethe place of the National Economic Council which the Governmentfailed to bring into existence earlier in the  year.   The  object  of theCouncil is&apos;&quot; to establish the nationalisation  of  industry, not in orderto consolidate State Socialism as we know it, but to devise a methodof. placing in the hands of  the producers and of the consumers thosemeans of. production  and exchange  which  have been  wrested from them for the  profit of  the Jew.&quot;  To attain this  end &quot; the  incubus ofcapital&quot; must be done away with, and &quot;all must participate  in thecommon necessaries of life.&quot;  The declaration of the  ConfederationGenerale du Travail, which is supposed to  be  the work of the more moderate section, finally assures its readers that &quot; when the hour for action has struck, the  Economic Council, far from  shrinking from its full responsibilities, will not fail to assume  them with  the  support ofthe whole  labour class.&quot;    It may be assumed, therefore, that thepolicy of the Council is intended to prepare the way for the ultimate     &apos;  [1739]                                          B
dictatorship of  the proletariat, which is the avowed aim  even of the moderate section of  the Confederation Gen&amp;ale du Travail.   Thereare indications that the Confederation is anxious to force another trial of strength, and the industrial situation can  only be  considered  asunsettled with rather a depressing outlook.    In spite of the activities of the extremists, however,  there are signs that labour is now less disinclined to settle down  to its  task.The collapse of the printers&apos; strike, which  it has been  suggested wasengineered  by  the  Government  with  a  view  to  handicappingpropaganda for the  Socialist Party during the recent  elections, andthe results of the strikes at the Magasins du Louvre, Bon Marche,Lafayette, Potin and others tend to prove that the  working classes are beginning to realise that the wage limit has been reached.    The currency crisis is somewhat less acute, and  much of themissing  silver  coinage  is  gradually  finding  its way back   intocirculation, which shows that  panic must  have been  one of theprincipal causes  for the shortage.  Traders  complain  that business is bad;  they consider that the adverse  rate  of the  exchange, thelabour unrest, and the failure of the United  States to ratify thePeace Treaty are the reasons for the present stagnation in trade.    Efforts are being made to reduce the very high cost of  living bythe manufacture and sale  of standard clothing and  boots, and by theestablishment of  municipal  kitchens.   This attempt on the part  ofthe Government is being received with general approval.    In Paris robberies  and murders in  broad daylight have become an almost daily occurrence.  So  far no active  steps appear to havebeen taken by the authorities to deal with the situation.    In connection with the recent arrest of Louis Mercier for dis-tributing copies of &quot; La Eeuille,&quot; which he had received from Zurich,there is good reason  to believe that some 50,000 copies of this paperhave been printed in English and  are  being  sent to  Ireland viaHolland.    There are now in Paris many Russians  who  are  said to be  infavour of the Bolshevik  Government and to  be in communicationwith Bussia.   These people are carrying on propaganda in favour ofa Soviet regime in France.  The Tsarist and  Menshevik Russians  inParis are incensed against the French Government for not havinggiven more support to Lenirr&apos;s opponents.   Longuet is  being bitterlyattacked by the Socialists for having  made the future of Russia his chief election cry, and for having  placed  Sadoul in a position  of honour at the head of  the Socialist list of candidates.  It seems possible that he may shortly be  compelled to vacate his. position  as leader of  the  Socialist Party, in which case he  will probably  besucceeded by Marcel Cachin, the editor of &quot; L&apos;Humanite,&quot; or ValliantCouturier, a newly-elected extremist, who is a personal friend  ofSadoul and Trotsky.  Cachin is said to  be the most venal of theFrench  Socialists.   He was bought  by  the  Egyptian NationalistDelegation.    Belgium. The weakening of  the Catholic Party at the recentelections may be attributed to the new system of voting, arid there seems little doubt that the majority of the younger working men votedSocialist. Competent authorities inBelgiumhave expressed the opinion,
 however, that no danger is to be anticipated from the extremists  at present.  M. Emile Vandervelde, the Socialist leader, in  one of his election speeches, openly condemned the Bolshevik system of govern- ment, and none of the newly elected Socialist Members of Parliament belong  to  the &quot;Jeune Garde  Socialiste&quot; or  to  &quot;La Confederation Socialiste Beige,&quot; the  two  most advanced Socialist  organisations in Belgium.  The anniversary of  the  Russian Revolution did not give rise to any revolutionary manifestations  in Belgium. . A meeting of &quot; La Jeune Garde Socialists&quot; was held  in Brussels on  the  11th  of November.    It  was  attended  by about 800 people, and  Joseph Jacquemotte, the principal speaker, delivered a violent speech against the policy of the  Allies in Russia.    This Society  is carrying on active  propaganda in  favour  of Bolshevik Russia and  is making extensive use of Professor  Goocle&apos;s articles  which appeared recently  in  the &quot;Manchester  Guardian.&quot; The total  membership  receipts of the  &quot; Jeune  Garde Socialiste &quot; during the last three months amount to less than  1,000  francs, while the expenses have been at least double that amount.  The member- ship of  the &quot;Confederation  Communiste Beige &quot;is  also  decreasing; meetings at  Brussels have recently  been poorly attended. .  The orators  seem to  have  little influence with their hearers, many  of whom only speak Flemish, whereas all the speeches are delivered  in the French language.    The labour situation in Belgium seems to  be  fairly  satisfactory and few strikes of any  importance have  taken  place recently.   A general strike, however, of  miners in the Charleroi district may take place in the near future unless the owners show a more  conciliatory attitude as regards the 50-hours working  week for surface workers and the question  of the minimum wage.    There has been  a notable absence of criticism  of Great Britain  in the press lately, and publicity has  been given in  the  newspapers  to the voluntary  assistance of British  agriculturists  in  re-stocking the devastated areas.    Switzerland. In  Switzerland,  as  in  Great  Britain and the United States of  America, the  violent advocates  of Bolshevism are mostly  foreigners who have succeeded in capturing the  extremist sections of the Socialist Party.  Except for the &quot; Jungburschen,&quot; the Swiss counterpart of  the Australian larrikins, there do not seem  to be many native Bolsheviks in Switzerland.  The  Federal authoritieshave come to realise the danger of propaganda by foreign extremists,and several revolutionaries, including  Sacerdote, the Zurich corre-correspondent of the &quot; Avanti,&quot;  have been expelled from  the country.   Itis   reported that the Swiss Bolshevik,  Nobs, has  received large sums  of  money from  the Russian  Soviet  Government which are tcbe  used  for the  purpose of Bolshevik propaganda in  Switzerland,France  and  England.   The money for England is  said to be in english  coin  or notes of high value.   The  anti-British  campaignconducted  by the  Egyptian malcontents and   the  Young Turkscontinues.  The Egyptian  Club in  Geneva promises  to become thecentre for all Eastern intrigue.  The partisans  of  the  ex-Khedive ofEgypt and the Egyptian Nationalist leaders  have now  reached  a working  agreement, and intense energy is being displayed  in the      [1739]                        &quot;&quot;                 B2
promotion  of  the Pan-Islam  League.  The  ez-Grand  Vizier ofTurkey,  Talaat  Pasha,  and  Mustapha  Djemal are  the  principalorganisers of the League.  They were recently in Germany, but it isnow rumoured that  Talaat  has succeeded  in  entering Switzerlandunder a  false  name.   The Young Turks, after a meeting at Berlinunder the presidency of M. Miiller, have decided to make Switzerlandthe centre for their  propaganda,  and  large quantities of literarypropaganda have already been sent to Zurich.    Germany. The situation  in  Germany  has  not  changedappreciably since  the last  report.    The Government  appears to disregard the  openly expressed insolence of the Monarchists, andcontinues its  repressive measures  against the Spartacists.   In thecourse of an interview  General von  Oven, commanding  the troopsin  Greater  Berlin, frankly  admitted that he  was in favour  of  aMonarchy, but stated that the only course at present was to supportthe de facto Government or  there would be another revolution.  Ina  recent  interview  Herr Noske stated that the  stability of theGovernment in Germany depended upon the economic developmentof the country; he also maintained that although there  may  be inGermany to-day 400,000 men  in uniform, in no  sense was  there anarmy of 400,000 men.  He maintained that  he could  count  only upon 100,000 men to control unrest, and of this number 40,000 were required for  the security of  Berlin  alone.    He  hinted that if a revolution  broke out as the  result  of  bankruptcy in Germany  itwould spread far beyond the borders of Germany, and that  in  orderto prevent such a catastrophe he  ought to be  allowed  to employwhatever forces he may consider necessary.  The danger  of personsbeing in improper  possession  of arms and  munitions  in central europe and of a market being found for these  in this country mustnot  be   overlooked.   It  is  not unlikely that there are  on theContinent vast quantities of munitions of war  which got  into thehands of private individuals  on the conclusion of the Armistice.    Rumours of another  Spartacist outbreak are in circulation, and inspite of  the repressive  policy of the Government and the  apparentapathy of the working classes, it is reported that the Communists,with  whom many of the Independent Socialists are joining forces,are developing their organisation throughout the country.  They are endeavouring  to  influence such classes of the proletariat  as  havehitherto remained untouched by the revolution, and a vigorous pro-paganda is  being started among the vagabonds, war invalids, farmlabourers and peasants.    A  special  Communist  organ  for theagricultural classes, called &quot; The Plough,&quot; has already appeared, andother periodicals  designed  for the  use  of  Communist Workers&apos;Councils may  be expected shortly.    The German extremists are in close touch with  their comrades in soviet Russia who, it is  said, disapprove of another outbreak like that at Munich, because they consider that such  partial experiments in revolution are likely  to shake the  faith in the Soviet system oflabour in Western Europe.  Proofs were obtained of the  connectionwhich exists  between  the  German  extremists  and  the RussianBolsheviks  when  the offices  of the Independent  Social  Democratswere raided,                           -
-    A programme of action discovered by the State defence troops who  broke up  a Communist meeting  at Karwo, in Mecklenburg, shewed that, although the Communist Party was very short of funds, in  the event  of a  Communist revolt in  Germany financial and material support had been promised from Soviet Russia.    Meanwhile, the  Berlin Trade Union Commission, after a stormy debate, has decided against the proclamation of  a General Strike by G4 votes to 62.   This decision is the more significant as the majority of the Commission are Independent Social Democrats  or Communists.    Recent reports  tend to  show  that the Monarchist  Party  in Germany is gaining  strength, and  that its propaganda is active.  A Monarchist Party, which  is  said to  have  no support in the large industrial  centres,  has  been  formed in Bavaria.   Attention  was called to the strong reactionary current prevailing among the Officers&apos; Corps of  the Reiclmochr at  a recent meeting  of  the Republican Leaders&apos; League at Kiel, and the receptions  accorded to Hindenburg, Ludendorff and  Mackensen have  called  forth  protests  from the Socialists.  The Chairman of the Social  Democratic  Party has made an appeal to  German workmen to join the local militia (Mnwohner- wehr), in  view of the  fast that the Nationalists may wish to use this&apos; force  for  the purposes of a  counter-revolutionary coup cVitat. It would appear that the majority of the German National  Peopled Party is in favour of the restoration  of  the Monarchy.   Meanwhile, Count Waldersee, who is ostensibly  the representative  of an anti- Bolshevik  organisation  which is   said to  have received  official recognition from  the  German Government, has arrived in  Holland and declared  that his real object is the restoration of  the  Monarchy. It is stated that he is anxious to know how  the British Government would view such  a project, as he is  desirous  of  visiting  England  to collect funds for the restoration of the old regime in germany.  It is reported that the candidature cf Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria for the post  of President of  the  Realm  is  being  seriously considered in extensive circles of the Centre Party, and that Prince Eitel -Frieclerich has a certain  following in Berlin, where he is in constant touch with the Military Party.   The greater part  of the Majority Socialist Party would appear to have  desired  a  renewed  understanding with the &quot;more  moderate section of  the Independent Socialists, so as to form a  combined front against  the reactionary  tendencies  which are beginning  to  appear; but the recent decision  of  the Independent Socialist Party at the Congress held at Leipzig on  the 2nd December  to  adhere  to the Third International will doubtless  have brought negotiations to a standstill.   No  disturbances took  place in  the Rhine Provinces  on the anniversary of the Revolution.  The coal situation in the occupied area is  increasing in gravity:  numerous factories have been obliged to close or  employ men on very short hours.  The presence of French coloured troops in occupied territory and the non-return of prisoners of war  by the  French are  causing increased  animosity  against france.   It is reported that a contract has been signed between the Soviet Government  in Russia and the German Emigration Society  &apos; East&quot;in Leipzig, according   to  which  the German  Society  will settle
 800,000 colonists, mainly in the neighbourhood of Dwinsk,  before 1923.   The  Soviet Government  will  pay the Germans 50,000,000 roubles in advance, but the colonists are to be provided with the necessary agricultural implements and stock. The inaugural meeting of  the  Germano-Argentine Economic  Society  has been  held in Hamburg, and efforts are being made to develop German trade with the Argentine.    German  political  and  commercial propaganda in  Spain  and Portugal  is  in charge of  Herr von  Storen, late  of  the  German Embassy in  Madrid.   His agent in Barcelona is  Herr Kroeger, who is  organising a press campaign against  Great  Britain.  A  league known as the &quot;League  of  German Patriots&quot; has  distributed large quantities of anti-British propaganda all over Germany.   The object of  this Society is to  boycott British  trade, and  to  secure American support for the reconstruction of Germany.    Crime and riotous living in Berlin  have increased  enormously of late-six or seven murders are reported daily.    Miss Sylvia Pankhurst, who has just returned from a tour in Germany,  describes  the Spartacists  as  being  cowed;  suspicious, irritable and despairing, owing to  the  Government  measures of repression. She says that the best men of the advanced movement have been  shot.  She was unfavourably impressed with the earnestness of the Spartacists and, though her evidence  has not been very reliable in the past, probably she reflects the. feeling of depression that has seized the German revolutionaries.    Austria. The inefficiency of  the existing Government  is universally recognised.   Its power  extends really very little beyond Vienna, and  in the Tyrol, Salzburg,  Styria, &amp;c, the Workers&apos; Councils are doing their utmost to precipitate an economic crisis  by stopping the movement of commodities from  one district to another.  They hold  up  trucks  destined  for Vienna and seize  the contents.   A probable  change of  Government,  .either  a  Monarchy or a  Soviet Eepublic, is openly discussed.    The  Communist  Party  in  Austria is  said to  be  renewing its activities,  but jts  meeting at  Vienna  on  the 7th  November to celebrate the anniversary of the Russian revolution does not  appear to  have been largely attended.   Eriedrich Adler, the President of the Workmen&apos;s Council, although he represents  the  extreme left of the Social Democratic Party, does not identify himself  entirely with the Communists&apos; ideals.   The news that  the British Socialist Party-has declared its  adherence to  the  Third  International has,however caused considerable enthusiasm  among the Austrian extremists,  who do not appear to  know how insignificant the party really is.    The  Monarchist movement  in Austria is making little progress owing to the difficulty of deciding  upon a suitable candidate  for the throne.  There is a general tendency to wait on events in Hungary where  it is  considered certain  that the  Monarchy will  soon be restored.    There appears to be a considerable emigration of Austrian  officers to  Brazil and the Argentine.   Serious riots are  reported to have broken out  in Vienna on the 1st December.  A meeting of middle- class  tradesmen&apos;8  councils was being held  to  protest against  the
Volkswehr a  large  section of which  is  said to hold  Communistviews being  allowed to take  over the whole reconstruction of thenew National Army, when the Volkswehr broke in upon the meeting and dispersed it.  This incident provoked further disturbances whichended in bloodshed.    In  this connection it is interesting to note that the Social Demo-cratic Party has resolved that it will be impossible at present for theState to carry out the party&apos;s policy for the socialisation of industry on any  large scale, as Austria depends upon foreign capital.  Severalprominent members  of the  party also  consider  that neither  theSecond  nor Third Internationals are satisfactory.    Hungary. The new  Government,  of  which  M. Huszar, the leader  of  the  Christian Socialist Party, is  Prime Minister, has fixedthe 21st  of December as  the  date  of  the  General Election  in hungary.   The  Supreme  Command of   the  National  Army  has declared its willingness to support the new Cabinet as  a  provisionalde facto Government.    A traveller who  was in  Buda Pesth a few weeks ago. reportsthat he  himself saw placards in  support of inviting an English Princeto accept the throne of Hungary.    In  well informed circles  both  in Vienna and Buda Pesth, it isreported that the  restoration  of a Monarchy in Hungary at  an  earlydate is looked upon as assured, but whether the monarch is  to be theex-Emperor Charles, or a Hapsburg Archduke, or  an English Princeis a matter  of  some uncertainty.  There is  evidence  of a  close connection between the Italian Foreign Office and the newly formedGovernment in Buda  Pesth.    It appears that the Austrian Government has refused to  handover Bela Kun and his associates to the Hungarians  on the groundthat proofs of criminal action have not been supplied.   In thisconnection it should be noted that  the Vienna newspapers publish a wireless message from Moscow  warning the Austrian Government ofthe reprisals  which  may  be  perpetrated upon  Austrian  officialsimprisoned in Russia  as hostages, should Bela Kun be handed overto the Hungarian Government.    There is  a strong anti-Semitic feeling  in Buda  Pesth, whichculminated recently in attacks on newspaper offices.    Italy.-While  the successes   of  the  Socialist  Party in  theGeneral Election were due  in a large measure to the apathy of theaverage voter out of a total electorate of 11,115,441  persons onlya little more than half of the electors recorded their votes and alsoto the  feeling  )f disappointment  with  the terms  of the Treaty ofPeace, which is prevalent amongst all classes in Italy, there is nodoubt that a  revolutionary  spirit does exist among the youngergeneration of the Italian working-class  population.  This unrest isdue partly to  economic causes, partly to the determination of  theItalian working man,  after his experiences in the army, to demand ahigher standard of living than he enjoyed before the war, and partly to Bolshevik  propaganda.    In this  latter  connection it is  an established fact  that  the  &quot;  Avanti,&quot; which  has  a  daily  issue  of300,000 copies, received financial  assistance from  Bela Kun, while
Lenin  is known to have supplied the Italian  Socialists with funds,which  Serrati, the editor of  the  &quot; Avanti,&quot; travelled to Switzerlandto collect.    It  is apparently quite possible  for  persons  to  travelbetween Italy and Switzerland and Austria without passports, andthere are at  the present time in  Italy several Russian agents whohave travelled direct from  Moscow.  It is this  Russian influenceprobably which inspires the Anarchist  movement  in  Italy,  whichis largely based on  the lines of Russian Bolshevism.  ] 20,000 lirehave  been collected in Italy to  provide  for the  publication  &apos;jfan  anarchist paper  to  be called  the  &quot; New Humanity,&quot;  which itis proposed  that  Malatesta should  edit.   Malatesta lias  residedin  this  country  for  many years  and  the  Italian  Governmenthas always opposed his return  to Italy.  Three  weeks  ago,  quitesuddenly, the   Italian  Consul-General  received  instructions   togrant  him a passport, and  this  concession now appears  to  havebeen extorted from the Italian  Government by the Socialists, who may be a little  disappointed when they find that in  the  course  ofyears and with the advance of age Malatesta has been converted from being a violent &quot; direct actionist&quot; into an academic Socialist of somemoderation.    Although  the  majority  of the  new  Socialist members in  theItalian Chamber are Extremists, it does not appear likely that theywill be successful in  bringing  about  an immediate revolutionaryoutburst,  even if  such is  their intention.  The general  strike  hasbeen only  a partial success, and  really proved the divergencies ofopinion  which already  exist  among  the  Socialist leaders.   Thecourageous attitude of the King created a  revulsion of feeling infavour of the dynasty, and the attitude of the army as a whole seemsto be loyal to the existiiig regime, although the theatrical performancesof d&apos;Annunzio rather complicate the situation.  There are grounds for believing that the  Italian General Staff is  really at the back ofd&apos;Anuunzio, even  if the Government has been taken  unawares.  It isfor this reason that some of the more sober-minded patriots in Italyare in  dread of a military coup oVttat, and go  so  far as to say thatd&apos;Annunzio was lacking in good manners when in  a  public speech atRome he spoke of  President Wilson  as a  cadaverous ghastly man and called his wife a  prostitute!  The result of the elections  has proved fairly conclusively  that d&apos;Annunzio  has already ceased  to bea popular hero, although he still appears to have a large following inthe Army and Navy.  His raid on Zara was no doubt more or  lessforced upon him in order to occupy his troops and to keep himself inthe limelight.  He may attempt  other coups in the near future, but,provided that no  fracas occur  between his followers  and the Jugo-Slavs, he is not likely -to recover  his popularity.    In the meantime  the  chief of  d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s Staff has beensent to Rome  to  try  to arrange  an  alliance with  Nitti to combatSocialism, provided, of  course, that  the question of Fiume  is  firstsatisfactorily  settled.    It seems probable  that  this  offer will  be refused.    Whether or not the present Government  will be able to remainin power would appear to depend upon its ability to find a programme which will unite  the  moderate elements in the Chamber, and upon its success  in  carrying  out the  work  of  reconstruction  which
Signor  Nitti has  so well begun.   Its  main duty  at the presentmoment is to preserve  the public peace, which  is threatened  by the extremists both on  the Eight and on the Left.  The failure of the attack against the Socialists made by the Patriotic  Revolutionarieslast month in Milan, in which officers and &quot; Arditi&quot;  took part, andthe firm attitude of  the Government have considerably strengthenedthe position of the Prime Minister, against whom the demonstrationwas really directed.  The Labour organizations in Italy are displayinga pro-Bolshevik  attitude, and  an appeal has  been published  by theItalian  General  Confederation of  Labour, calling upon all the con-federated  associations to see  that workmen refuse to produce armsand  ammunition destined  for  use against the Russian  Bolsheviks.Demonstrations  were held in various  towns in  Italy  on the  7th ofNovember in support of the Socialists  and in commemoration of theRussian Revolution.   German newspaper  correspondents are already in Italy workingtactfully to produce a rapprochement between Italy and Germany, andGerman commercial travellers from Frankfurt, Chemnitz, Stuttgartand other towns are in  Milan.  English traders do not appear to beinteresting themselves in Italy.    Greece. At a meeting  of Greek Hoyalists which was held inLondon on the 30th  November,  M. Katapodes, the Chairman, read aletter from  ex-King Constantine&apos;s private secretary thanking  him and his friends in England for their efforts to interest Englishmen inthe restoration  of the  Monarchy and the Greek Constitution.  a discussion followed  on  the alleged tyranny of M. Venizelos, duringwhich it was stated  that the  right to hold public meetings had beenabrogated and that freedom of opinion had been suppressed.  It was alleged  that 95 per cent, of the Greek people were in favour of  King Constantine.    There is a vigorous Royalist-plus-German  propaganda which  isbeing  worked  from the &quot;United States.   The&apos; chief organiser inAmerica  is a certain Theophilatus, a wealthy shipowner, who is intouch with Maudakas,  a shipowner in Athens.  Money, propaganda and newspapers are frequently sent from America to Greece, and alarge cargo  of literature which is expected to arrive shortly will be seized by  the police.    In  Greece  there are no  known organizations  working for thereturn  of the ex-King, but it  is reported that there is a good deal ofintrigue going  on  and that  a  firm belief  exists among the moreignorant classes that the ex-King will come back.  He certainly hasa following among the  peasants, who are irritated  by increased taxation and the slowness  of  demobilisation, and there are said to beseveral thousand  ex-Army officers and officials now in Greece whowould support him  if  an opportunity should arise.   The recent plotto assassinate M. Venizelos, the truth of which ex-King Constantinedenies,  is alleged to have been engineered by officers.   If M. Venizeloscan continue to count upon the assistance of the two groups whichsupport him the radical  section  led  by  M.  Repoules  and thearistocratic and plutocratic section including  M. Negropondes, theMinister  of Finance he ought to be  able to  maintain his Govern-ment in power. -  There is little labour  unrest  in  Greece, and the        [1739]                                            C
great majority of  the industrial population appears to he  on the sideof the Government.  The one source  of danger  is the high cost ofliving, but it is hoped that a fall in freights may reduce prices.   Bolshevism does not gain ground in Greece.  In Thessaly, wherethe system of  land tenure deprives the peasant even of tenant rights,the Government is acquiring estates  by purchase in order  to dividethem among the peasants.  It is possible  that, if this policy is tooslow, the peasants may  take the law into their own  hands andattempt to expropriate the landowners.  It is unlikely, however, inview of the distinctly individualistic character of  the Greek peasant,that he is ever likely to fall a victim  to  Communistic  ideals.   Theextreme Socialists who  seceded from the Labour Union of the EadicalLabour Party  adhere to the Third International, but  there are only between  ten and twelve  thousand of them,  whereas the EadicalLabour Party, which supports M. Venizelos, is at least three  timesmore numerous.   The pro-German  paper &quot; Hesperine,&quot;  which has lately   beenrevived,  has attracted  some  notice  by publishing in instalmentsBernard Shaw&apos;s account of  the origin  of the war, which  endeavours to lay the entire responsibility on England.   Roumania. It would appear that Eoumania is not possessed of alarge enough artisan class to form an independent political organisationof its own.  At the  same time, there are sufficient agitators to  cause trouble if  the Government relaxes its present form of administration.The close contact which exists between Eoumania and the Bolsheviksboth in Russia and Hungary has  accentuated the internationalisticsentiments of  the roumanian Socialists.   Dr. Eakowsky is the realchief of the Social Democrat  (Marxist) Party,   the propaganda  ofwhich  is of an anti-militarist character an 1 is  carried on with theassistance of Eussian and German money.   Up  to the present time it is  believed that this propaganda has not affected the army.  If thisis true, it is probably  due to  the  fact that a vast majority of  theEoumanian soldiers  are peasants.  The peasant class has no leaningstowards Socialism and  now that agrarian reform  has been  definitelysettled and the food crisis ie past, it would seem that the danger of a bolshevik revolution in Eoumania is not great.   In  Bessarabia and the Bukowina there does not as yet  appear tobe much  political  agitation, but  in  Transylvania the  nationalist party is already a force which will piobably play an important r&amp;lein the future of Greater Eoumania.   On the occasion of the withdrawal of the roumanian troops fromHungary the roumanian General issued  a manifesto by  wireless  tothe effect  that the  roumanian occupation  had been inspired purelyfrom  legitimate military reasons  and that Roumania  had  neverentertained  any idea of conquest or retaliation.   On the same  day a message radiated  from  a German station stated that the Eoumanianoccupation had paralysed  Hungarian industry   and  crippled theagricultural production  of the country  for many years to come.   Czecho-Slovakia.-As the result of  a Government crisis dueto alleged terrorism on the part of the  Social Democrats in trade organisations,  the National Socialist Party  has decided to leave the
 Coalition,  which  was  formerly  composed  of  Agrarians,  Social Democrats and National Socialists.    Further evidence of the lack of union between  the  Czechs and the Slovaks is shewn by the fact that a deputation, purporting to be representative  of  Slovakia,   recently  visited the   Czecho-Slovak Legation in Vienna and  demanded that there  should be a separate Slovakian Mission in Vienna.   The demand was refused.    Considerable hostility is said to exist on the Czecho-Slovak Polish frontier and information  has  been received  that  the Czecho-Slovak Government is employing German officers to  train its  army.    Diplomatic  representatives  from the  Czecho Slovak  army  in Siberia have addressed a memorandum  to the local Allied authorities bitterly attacking Admiral Koltchak&apos;s Government and requesting to be sent home.    Balkan  States. On the whole the Montenegrins appear to be satisfied with Serbian rule.  The few political malcontents have little in common with the mass of the people.  They represent the ancien regime  under King Nicholas.   There is, however, another group  of political  rebels who are  really  little  better  than  bandits.   It  is reported that these people are trained in Italy and sent secretly into Montenegro by the Italians to  keep &quot; the Montenegrin question &quot; alive.    A special convention has been signed between Greece and Bulgaria with  regard to the emigration  of their respective  nationals.  The convention is intended to prevent new wars in the Balkans, and other Balkan  States  may  sign  the  agreement within  the  next   twelve months.    Poland. The defeat of its Bill to relieve the food shortage by the institution  of  a free  traffic in corn instead of the  nominal Government monopoly  led  to  the  resignation  of the  Paderewski Cabinet.  The  defeat of the Government was  due to a  temporary coalition between the Peasants&apos; Party and the  Socialists; and after a delay of nearly three weeks a new Ministry has been formed with M. Skulski as Prime Minister.    The position of the new Government  will&apos; not be an easy  one. The economic situation in Poland has not improved and considerable discontent  prevails  among  the  populace.    This   facilitates  the Bolshevik propaganda, which is very active and is undermining the influence of the Polish Socialist Party and forcing it towards the  Left in order to maintain its prestige.    The moral of the Polish troops is  reported to be low.  This  isattributed to the lack of warm  clothing and  equipment  and  to theneglect  of  their men  by the  officers.   General   Szepticki,  whocommands the Polish forces in  the  field against the  Bolsheviks,states that successful Bolshevik propaganda is being  carried  on bywell-equipped  Polish Bolshevik   detachments  opposite  his  troops.He is  reported  to be pessimistic as  to his ability to maintain hisfront through the winter.  Bolshevik agents are said  to be active inGalicia, where their propaganda takes the form of  sowing  discontent among the peasants.       [1739]                                          C 2
   Finland. Efforts are, being made to form  a  centre  SocialistCoalition in the Finnish Parliament.  The defeat of the Left Socialistsin the elections to the Socialist Party Congress tends to prove that thecountry is not inclined towards Bolshevism.  The present agents ofthe Russian Soviet Government in Finland are said to be incapable of leadership or organisation; at the same time, it is tolerably certainthat the Bolsheviks have  little to fear from Finnish intervention intheir affairs.   M. Kotonen, Vice-President of the Finnish Parliament,has stated that the Diet would never agree to a war with Russia, andhis statement is probably a correct one in spite of the fact that the production-German party in Finland, which&apos; formerly supported the election of President Stahlberg with the idea of preventing Finnish interven-tion  in Russia on the side of the Entente, is now reported to  be working with  Mannerheim&apos;s party in  favour of  action  against theBolsheviks.  Mannerheim can count upon the assistance of the SchiitzCorps, which now consists of about 90,000 active  members equipped with rifles, machine-guns  and artillery, and 14,000 passive members who support the organisation by voluntary contributions.  This corpswas  established in the  autumn  of  1917, for  the maintenance of lawand  order,  and forms an  excellent  and  reliable reserve for  theRegular  Army, the fidelity of  which cannot be so implicitly relied upon owing to the effect of Bolshevik propaganda.   Russia. Mr. 0&apos;Grady&apos;s mission for the exchange of prisoners isnot yet concluded.  As soon as M. Litvinoff arrived in Esthonia  he made it clear that, in spite of the insistent statement  in  the wirelessmessages that  the  Soviet  Government  was  anxious  to exchangeprisoners, the real object of his mission was to obtain peace with theEntente  Governments.  This anxiety  for peace is inconsistent withthe daily assertion in the wireless  messages  that  the Red forces areeverywhere victorious  and that the Soviet Government is more stablethan ever before. The real facts are to be inferred from a trustworthyreport that a  few days ago the  Commissioner  of  the  Interior inPetrograd reported to the Council of Peoples&apos; Commissaries at Moscowthat because of lack  of co-operation among the workmen and  theirfailure to grasp Communistic principles, the early fall of the SovietGovernment was  inevitable,  unless  recognition  could  be obtainedfrom Allied and neutral countries.  The only hope  for the SovietGovernment was therefore to make a supreme effort  to throw dustin the eyes of the world and make a peace  that would guarantee  its position  before enough of the  truth became known to  make  its position untenable.   All this  fits  in very well with the proceedingsof Litvinoff during the  negotiations  with Mr.  0&apos;Grady.   while Mr.  Goode and Lt.-Colonel Malone, who had been  carefully spoon-fedduring their visit to Russia, are conducting a campaign in this countryin  favour  of peace,  Litvinoff is according interviews  to Reuter&apos;scorrespondent in Copenhagen in which he sets forth his peace terms,and  he has made it clear that the British prisoners are to be used ashostages to force this country to bring pressure  to bear upon the other allies to make peace with Soviet Russia.  He does not appear to bein the least concerned about the Russian prisoners held by the Allies.As is usual with all the Jewish Commissaries, he cannot resist endinghis messages with a threat that unless they are  accepted the terms
will  become harder.  There is very good reason  for believing that,whatever other governments may decide, the  American  Governmentwill not treat with the Soviet Government, even though the Bolsheviksappear to be taking  into their ranks members of the more moderateparties.   It has become evident during the negotiations that Litvinoffattaches great importance  to  obtaining  permission for  Soviet repre-sentatives to reside in  the Allied  and neutral countries, where, ofcourse, they  would become centres for revolutionary propaganda.   The  Soviet  Government undoubtedly desires  peace because, inspite of its recent military successes and the Communist enthusiasmwhich they maintain  exists in the Bed Army, its position is by nomeans secure and its leaders  realize that it cannot remain in powerunless it succeeds in establishing friendly relations with the  outside world and obtaining financial assistance from Great Britain and theUnited States.  All reports tend to prove that the risings of peasantsand workmen are daily becoming  more serious and that the economicconditions in  Petrograd and  Moscow are growing  steadily worse.The price of every kind of foodstuff is  almost  prohibitive and it isimpossible to exaggerate the  fuel crisis.  Although the epidemic ofcholera in Petrograd has died out, spotted fever and other contagiousdiseases are prevalent,  and  the  Bolsheviks are  said to be  much concerned at the high death rate and low birth rate.   In accordance with its peace policy the Soviet  Government isdoing everything in its power to try to impress  public opinion inEngland  with its desire to come to terms with the more moderatesections of radical  opinion in Russia.  Thus a decree was recently published in the &quot; Pravda &quot; by which two Mensheviks,  Martov  andDan, three revolutionary socialists and a cadet were admitted to theGovernment, and it was reported that  the freedom  of the press, in theory at any rate, has been re-established. It was also rumoured  thatthe Bolshevik leaders are contemplating  the idea of holding elections for a Constituent Assembly, with a programme which includes theabolition of  Extraordinary Commissions and proposals  of peace toKoltchak  and  Denikin.   In  Russia  the  tone  of  Lenin and his supporters, not unnaturally, is somewhat different and the  desire for peace is attributed to the British  Government, which is alarmed bythe friendly  attitude to the Russian  Soviet displayed by the  Britishworking  classes and  to the  triumphs recently gained  by the  red army.   Russians  are  assured,  however,  that while  the  entente powers are convening a Peace Conference the Red Army will finallydefeat its opponents, in order  that the Soviet  Government alone shallrepresent  Russia when  proposals   for peace  are discussed.   but although in  theory the policy of the Bolsheviks has  become  lessviolent, there seems  little real change in  their methods of government,nor does their system of administration appear  to  have become morepopular,  though it  is possible  that  in  view of the failures of theWhite Armies  the  number of persons  professing themselves Com-munists is increasing.  On the other hand, at the  All Russian Con-ference on work in the villages Lenin claimed that he had gained thesupport of the  poorest class of peasants,  but admitted  that theremainder of  the  peasants  were entirely  in sympathy  with the capitalists.  It is only by a policy of rigid force that the  SovietGovernment remains in power.  Its leaders, of  whom  Trotsky now
appears to be the guiding spirit, are men of determination and energywho stop at no measure of  Terrorism  which they consider necessaryto maintain their government.    It would not be right to assume that  the retreat  of  general denikin will continue.  On  the contrary, it is  quite probable thatthe &quot; Red&quot; offensive will  rapidly  spend itself, and that the SovietCommissaries are alive to their danger from this quarter.    In the area controlled by General  Denikin it is reported  that theGermans are endeavouring  to  push thtir trade to the utmost.,  Theyare offering goods at pre-war prices, plus 50 per cent., and are paying for what they buy in Donetz roubles; the rate of exchange is fixedapproximately at 1 mark for 50 kopecks.    It is stated  that  Bolshevism cannot prosper in the  Ukrainebecause 85  per  cent   of  the  population  are  peasants  who  are determined  to keep  their land.   Of  the  3,500,000  Jews in  theUkraine few profess Bolshevik views.   Denikin  is reported to have endeavoured to stop the murder of Jews, but not very effectively.    According  to a  statement by  Skoropadsky, ex-Hetnmn of  theUkraine, and Stephankowski, director of the Ukrainian Bureau, whohave recently been in  Berlin, there is close liaison between that townand Moscow ;  they have so far, however, been unable to identify anyof those connected with the  movement in Berlin.  The above  has some interest when considered in connection with a report  recently received that the Berlin banking firm of Mendelsohn is carrying  on negotiations with the  representatives  of the  Russian Soviet Govern-ment in Berlin.    Bolshevik  propaganda, especially  that organised by the CentralBureau  of the Moslem organisation of the Communist Party, is still being  pushed  with  great energy.  The  Revolutionary  MilitaryCouncil of  the Baltic Fleet has  addressed an  appeal to Britishsailors,  begging  them  not  to  allow themselves  to  be   used  asinstruments to  stifle  the  efforts of a free people and urging themto join  the Third International.  The  Pan-Islamic movement doesnot seem to be gaining much ground in the Crimea and, so far as  isknown,  there  is no Pan-Islamic organisation in Sebastopol.  Thereare, however,  at Simpferopol certain organisations which  have  as their object the uniting.of  Modems for  political intrigue which, it isbelieved, receive  financial  assistance  from Moscow.  It  is  reportedthat during the  Socialist Congress at Lucerne in August the british representatives,  including  Arthur Henderson,  Ramsay  Macdonaldand Philip Snowden  and  his wife, entered into close relations withthe  Ukrainian delegates and were supplied  with  propaganda withwhich to stir up feeling in  England.    The reverses suffered by Admiral  Koltchak  in Siberia appear tobe  due  more  to the  unpopularity  of his Government  than to the ,military ability or  even the  propaganda of  the  Bolsheviks.  TheGovernment; standing  apart  from  the population, not recoguised  bythe public or  the local authorities, proved itself unable to maintainorder even by the most severe methods of repression, or to arrangefor the defence of the  country.  As a result of this bad administration,Admiral Koltchak&apos;s  Government  allowed   the enthusiasm which followed the fall of  the Soviet Government in Siberia to evaporate,with the result that his military adventure failed.  The revolt against
his Government was largely engineered by General Gaida, the Czechleader, who has  now left  the country.  The movement appears  tohave  been democratic in character, but not  Bolshevik, although nodoubt Bolshevik  emissaries have  made mischief wherever possible.The Bolsheviks have also been quick to avail themselves of Koltchak&apos;sunpopularity, and  it is  reported that  in their  present advance intoSiberia their  methods  are far less  aggressive  than during  their previous   incursions  into  the  country.   In Eastern Siberia  theirpropaganda seems to be aetive, and at a recent meeting in a  smalltown  in that region, which  was attended by Socialists from Korea, itwas decided that  the Korean  bourgeoisie must be destroyed and a close  connection  effected between  Korea  and Soviet  Russia.   AKorean delegation attended the Congress of  Soviets in Moscow thismonth.    Baltic States. A new Cabinet has  been formed in Esthoniaby Tennison, a member of the  Popular Party.   This  Cabinet, which includes Socialists, appears  to have decided to make peace with theBolsheviks; it is probably influenced  in this decision by the recentresolution  in the Esthonian  Parliament, General Udeniibch&apos;s defeat,and the unreliability of some of the  Esthonian troops.  Radek, theorganiser  of the Spartacist  movement in Germany, has been released in order to enable him to appear at the Dorpat  Conference as one ofthe Soviet delegates to conduct peace negotiations with  Esthonia.These negotiations  may  break down, for  while  the Esthonianscontemplate only an armistice, nothing short  of a definite peace willsatisfy the Communists.    Although the  other Baltic States are reported to be opposed to the opening of peace negotiations, there arerumours that the Letts have signed a secret  peace with the Bolsheviksand that  an agreement has been  arrived  at by which  the LettishLegation  in  Copenhagen   is  to look  after  Bolshevik interests  in denmark.    It is  reported  that representatives  of Esthonia,  Latvia and lithuania, White Russia  and Ukrainia  have  recently decided  toestablish a permanent Conference in Berlin with a view to protecting the right of self-determination aud independence of their peoples.  (A  special account of the recent  activities of General von der  Goltzand Colonel Bermont in the Baltic  Provinces is contained in Part  ii of this report.)    Sweden.--It is reported that  the main object of the ScandinavianBolshevik Congress which  is shortly  to be held at Stockholm is  toattempt  to break  the  old  International Socialist organisation  in  .Scandinavia.    On the other hand, at  a recent meeting of the  Swedish  MetalWorkers&apos;  Union a resolution passed by the Metal Workers&apos; Congress,to the effect that Local  Sections of the Union should have the rightto  initiate agitation for higher wages and  to call strikes  without reference  to the Committee  of the Union, was rejected by a large majority on a referendum being taken.  The result of this referendummay be regarded as a signal defeat for the extreme Socialists.    It is   interesting  to  note that Frederick  Strom,  has   beenendeavouring  to get into  touch with Litvinoff at Copenhagen   He
was  not allowed,  however, to go  beyond Elsinore and has now returned to Stockholm.  Strom has recently completed a propagandatour in  the North o(  Sweden on behalf of the  Soviet  Government.He is said to have had considerable success and a large  proportion ofthe population  in  North Sweden undoubtedly  have pro-Bolsheviksympathies.   The Extreme Socialists at Gothenburg have decided to issue a daily  newspaper for  the  west of  Sweden to be called &quot; GoteborgsKurren.&quot;  A company with n. minimum capital of 50,000 Kr. anda maximum capital of 150,000 Kr. has been formed  for this purpose.   Norway.-Since  the Socialists  opened a circle for the study of communist doctrines it is reported that there is a decided movementamong the younger  university students  to enter the  ranks  of theInternationalists.   A Conference on the  Nationalisation of  Industry was held inChristiania on  the  15th  November.   The  Committee submitted proposals for the establishment of a Workers&apos; Council to  the Secretaryfor Social Affairs, but the workers themselves seem to  view the pro-posals with indifference.   A meeting of protest against Norway participating in the blockade of Soviet Bussia, which was held on the 17th November at Christiania,was  attended  by  3,000  people,  the majority of  whom were notactively  engaged in  the  Bolshevik  movement.   The  meeting was arranged by the  Young Students&apos; Party, and appears  to have been more  for  the purposes of Bolshevik propaganda than  for protesting against the blockade, since the opportunity was utilised for pushingthe sale of &quot; Klassekampen &quot; and other Bolshevik literature.  there seems little  doubt  that the  blockade is extremely  unpopular in norway.    The International  Transport Workers&apos; Congress which was tohave been held at Christiania on the  10th November was  postponed.    Denmark. The latest statistics shew that the wage of  skilled labour has been raised 170 per cent, on  an  average since 1914, andthat of  unskilled labour 200 per cent.  The  latest official figure forthe increased cost of living is  150  per cent.   In November returnsshowed that there were 10,000 unemployed, whereas in  October 1918there were 32,000.    An  organisation  has  been discovered in  Copenhagen  for the printing and forging of passports.  Many visas for England are saidto have been forged at a cost of from 1,000 to 1,500 Kr. for eachvisa.   Rudolf Osten, a German, who  is stated to  be a Bolshevik, isconnected with this organisation.    A Bolshevik shipping company is reported to  have been  started at Copenhagen, the promoters of which are two Russians and threeDanes.   One ship has been built, and  the  captain is to be given3,000 Kr. for every successful trip.    A new party has been formed in Denmark called the SocialistParty of the Left, which is to include  all Socialist groups opposedto  the  official  Social  Democratic  Party.  The policy of  the newparty is revolutionary, and it will adopt  the same standpoint as  theNorwegian Labour Party and the  Swedish Socialists, both  of which
3are Bolshevik in tendency.  The vaiious groups which compose theparty are not strong numerically, and it is anticipated that the party will have to face financial difficulties.   Herr  Ernst  Christiansen,Chairman of the &quot; League of  Youth,&quot;  is  the Chairman of the newparty,  which  has  already declared  its  adherence  to the  ThirdInternational.    In an article which appeared  recently in &quot; Klassekampen&quot; the writer complained of the  failure  to.impress the ideas of an  inter-national revolution upon the British people.  The  article gave thefollowing  figures  showing the strength  of  &quot;The  Young  SocialistParty&quot; in  various  European  countries,  viz.:   Germany,  30,000;Austria, 14,600;  Italy,  25,000;  Holland, 2,500.  Branches of thesociety are also  said to exist  in  Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, France,Belgium, Spain,  Portugal and Switzerland, but no figures of member-ship appear to be available.    Holland. The Duteh authorities  are aware  that  Bolshevikagents are entering Holland for foreign propaganda purposes.   Theyarrive by way of Winschoten and Nieuweschans and then proceed toRotterdam, where they board outward-bound ships either as membersof the crews or as  stowaways.   American Bolshevik emissaries with large funds at their disposal are said to be due to arrive in  Hollandshortly.  They may travel via  England.    A  Society known  as  the  &quot; Union  of  Socialist  RevolutionaryIntellectuals,&quot; the object of which  is to promote the revolutionaryideal amongst all intellectuals,  and to prepare them to fulfil the duties which they will  be called  upon to undertake when  the  CommunistSociety has been established&quot;, has been inaugurated in Holland.    The following circular, issued by this Union&apos; to the  Bourgeoisie ofthe Netherlands, throws some light on its proposed activities:          &quot; We have the honour to inform you that we shortly intend     to remove you from your  positions and your possessions, and in     connection  with this  we  advise you to join us, as the changes     that  we hope to  make  will  be easier to  carry out with your     consent  than  by  your  opposition.   If you have the idea of     opposing us, you yourself  will be responsible for the consequences,           &quot; (Signed)     Union of the Netherlands Revolutionary                           Intellectuals  to   the   Netherlands                           Bourgeoisie.&apos;1    Its membership consists of professional men. Intellectuals and. oneor two well-known Communists, suoh as  Sneevliet and Mrs. Roland-Hoist.  -The  Union  is  international  in  character  and has  its headquarters at  Amsterdam.    It  is reliably  reported that German  agents are making further efforts to spread Bolshevik propaganda in the United Kingdom andalso in India and Japan.   An  organisation for this purpose has beenestablished in Holland and the captains and crews of  Dutch vessels are bribed to convey the Bolshevik agents to Suez, where they are todisembark.    Brandsteder, the Bolshevik marine  leader, who has just returned from the Dutch  East Indies, is said  to have established himself at       [1739]                                         C 3   -
Flushing, where he proposes  to  spread  Bolshevik propaganda amongthe seafaring community.    It is also reported that Sneevliet, who was recently expelled fromthe Dutch  East  Indies and  who  is  at present  working  on the&quot; Tribune,&quot; a Communist newspaper  edited  by Wynkoop, is shortlygoing to the United States of America and Japan.    Spain. The industrial  situation  in  Spain  shows  little sign ofimprovement.   At Malaga and other towns strikes are in  progress and the compromise at Barcelona appears to have ended in failure.The lock-out has been renewed by the employers, and the workmenare equally determined.   So  far no disorder has taken place, but theoutlook is  undoubtedly serious.  It seems probable that the employers are supported in their policy by Senors La Cierva and Maura, both ofwhom are opposed to the moderate section of the Conservative party which supports the Government.   It  is  reported  that the  Germanagitators Schseffer, Ruggeberg and  Carl  Hartwig are  assisting theSpanish extremists.  The last named has recently been in Barcelona,having left Bilbao,  where he had been promoting discontent in themining districts.  Documentary proof has been obtained shewing that german agents in Spain have received instructions to do their utmost to foment trouble between employers and employed  in the hope thatthe acute unrest would benefit the expansion of German trade at theexpense of that of other countries.  There appear to  be  three  welldefined groups among the Spanish Syndicalists.  The  most moderateof these is led  by Salvador Segui.   The central group is controlled by Angel Pestaiia, who is also at the head of the  Syndicalist policeorganization.  , Despite &quot;his  assurances to the Government, he seemsundoubtedly to be an anarchist and dreamt of becoming the Lenin of spain.  He has more followers than Segui, but  is not in favour  ofrevolution  until the  Syndicalist movement  has  expanded  beyondCatalonia.   The Extremist group is led by David Bey and F. Barthe,who preach revolutionary action and are planning the organization ofa national congress  of  representatives  from the various workmen&apos;ssocieties at Madrid some time  this month.   The followers of Seguiappear to  work in close  touch with the anarchist group at Marseilles,while  Pestana is  connected with the Extremists  in  Algiers and switzerland.   In consequence of the strike and lock-out it is thought better thatBritish ships should not proceed to Barcelona for the present.     Portugal. The general situation in Portugal is described  ascalm and, unless the Monarchist party becomes a disturbing factor,a period of comparative  tranquillity may  be anticipated.  There stillappears to be a Monarchist majority in the country, but the party is somewhat divided in its allegiance to ex-King Manoel, and is unlikely to  attempt any action  at present.  The Government, which is  in reality a combination of all  parties, is fairly popular and appears  tobe devoting itself to the problems of reconstruction and to the main-tenance of order.   The  report, mainly spread by German agents  in spain, that Portugal is a hot-bed of Bolshevism has been officiallydenied by the  Portuguese Legation in Madrid, and  is probably quiteuntrue,  The  causes for any unrest there may be  in Portugal are
economic and are due to the high cost  of  living, the depreciation inthe value of money and profiteering.  There are, of course, Extremistsin Portugal, but their following is not large, and at  the present time they appear to be quarrelling among themselves.  Their two  organs,the &quot; Batalha &quot; and the &quot; Combate &quot; were  in disagreement as to the delegates who were sent  to  the International Labour Congress atWashington.  A  considerable number  of Bolshevik agitators whohave been expelled from the South American Republics are nowarriving in Portugal.  On their arrival  they are imprisoned  by theGovernment, but it seems likely that they will be. released  after ashort  detention.    Meanwhile,   the  &quot;Batalha&quot;   has  seized  theopportunity for making trouble and  is  agitating for  the  release ofthe undesirables.    Egypt.-Mr. Tom Mann, the new Secretary  of the Amalga-mated  Society of  Engineers,  who  has  lately committed  himselfpublicly to a revolutionary policy, confided  the following statement to a  friend last week.   He said that a serious  rising  had  been planned to  take  place  in Egypt on  the  12th, or within  a week orten  days  after that date, and that as soon as the  Press reportedmatters to be  acute, this country was to  be  flooded with  leafletsurging  the working class to demand independence for Egypt.  Hesaid that only three people in the country knew  of the plan, andthat the leaflets had already been printed  and were  stored at  centresawaiting the word  for distribution.  Though Mr. Mann is prone toexaggeration it  may be  taken  that, the  Extremist section  in  thiscountry is watching Egypt very jealously  and is determined  to takeadvantage of any occurrence adverse to the stability of the Empire.    As  was  to be expected the new Cabinet is much criticised bythe Extremists, and is  being  violently attacked in the vernacularpress.   The opposition  is as  much  from  the Copts as from the&apos;Moslems.   Considerable Nationalist agitation  is going  on  in, theprovinces, where attempts are being made to engineer strikes and toform  syndicates.   In this connection it should  be noted that, before leaving Egypt, Pizzuto, the Italian Bolshevik  agitator,  who  hasbeen deported, took elaborate  measures to  prevent the  collapse ofsyndicalism.   Efforts  are now being  made for the formation ofa Central Bureau to which all the syndicates and clubs  throughoutthe country should be amalgamated.   It is undoubtedly intended that this Bureau  should  be used for the organisation of a  general strike for political ends.    It is reported that Bolshevik agents, well supplied with German,Russian, and  French bank notes,  have  been  sent by Erkine, therevolutionary  agitator,  to Turkey,  Syria,  Palestine,  and  Egypt.These agents are carrying on  a vigorous Bolshevik  and anti-Britishcampaign, and appear  to  be having considerable success in LowerEgypt among the student classes.   Zaghloul is  said to have recentlygiven 10,000 fr. to Erkine for  the purchase of arms, and a  certainamount of traffic in arms is still going on.   It is reported that storesof arms are hidden  near Spezzia  and in Palestine,  and information has been received that the Nationalists are attempting to  land arms from Italian  vessels at Ras-Dhabbe, 70  miles west of Alexandria.It is understood that Prince Omar Pasha Toussoum is the  moving
spirit;   Steps  have  been  taken-in conjunction with  the  localauthorities  to deal with  the situation  as far as possible.   the attempts by the Extremists to celebrate the anniversary of ZaghlouTsrequest for permission to  go  to Europe proved  a   failure;  the projected holiday was not  sanctioned and  the railway strike did not materialise.   George  Creel, the  author of &quot; ireland&apos;s Fight for Freedom,&quot; hasrecently written a violent  article on  England&apos;s  treatment of Egypt,&apos;which is being reprinted in the New York  &quot; Call.&quot;   Turkey.-The  Central Committee  of  the Turkish  SocialistParty has been formed in Constantinople on the model of the Frenchand  Swiss  organisations,  and the first provincial branch has  been opened at Adrianople.  Under the influence of Kanakaris, the leader of the Bank Employees&apos; Union, Syndicalist views dominate both the christian and Moslem sections of  the Ottoman Socialist Party, and a newspaper  is  to be  published shortly which  will represent these views.  :  The  Syndicalist  movement in   Turkey seems  to  be. led by propagandist agents from the Syndicalists of  France and Germanywho reach Constantinople  via Greece and Bulgaria.   Asa result of  the recent overtures made by the Government  tothe  Committee of the Nationalist Congress at Sivas, it is reportedthat Mustapha Kemal Pasha has informed  the Grand Vizier thatthe Nationalist organization will no longer interfere in public affairs or attempt  to  interfere with  the  orders  of the  Government,  TheNationalist  movement in  the interior of Asia  Minor has  gainedground, and.Mustapha Kemal Pasha  is  now  reported  to  have  awell armed and disciplined volunteer army under his command; theuse to  which the army will be placed no  doubt depends upon howfar the decisions of  the Paris Conference satisfy the aspirations ofthe  Nationalist leaders.  Mustapha Kemal has  already issued  a proclamation announcing  his intention of resisting any attempt topartition Turkey.    Mr. W. J. Ellis,  the special correspondent of the &quot; New  YorkHerald &quot;in Europe, has reappeared  in Constantinople.  He is very active  in cabling accounts to America of  the  conditions in  turkey and his tone is anti-British.    Turkish  Nationalist propaganda in  England  has lately  beencarried on  by means  of   cinematograph films  shewing  the  massmeetings alleged to  have been  held in  Constantinople  protesting against the Greek occupation of  Smyrna.  This particular film was sent to England by the Ottoman Committee in  Switzerland.    Syria.-The educated and commeicial classes are reported  to be willing : to  accept French  control, but the  majority of the populationstill resents the idea.   Meanwhile active propaganda is being carriedon by  the Turkish Nationalist Party, and  there are indications that italian propaganda will soon be fully developed.    Reliable information tends to  show that since the withdrawal  ofthe  British  Army and the occupation of Syria by the French, the emir   Feisul,  with   other well-known  Turkish  and  EgyptianNationalists, is likely to  be engaged in  spreading anti-British andPan-Islamic propaganda,   The Emir would  seem to be of opinion
that the ultimate object of the English is to divide and dominate thewhole of Arabia, sharing the proceeds with France; and our refusal to assist Arabia-who daring  the  war fought loyally against theTurks in  obtaining  her  independence, is the main cause of  thedissatisfaction.    Persia.-According  to  a report in Merv which  was receivedfrom Tashkent, Enver Pasha is  now in Russia and will at a momentwhich  seems suitable to  him lead all the Mohammedans of Russiainto Persia,  drive  out  the  British  and establish  MohammedanCommunist rule in Tehran.  The members of  the Persian nationalist party in Switzerland  are  engaged in  active propaganda against theBritish influence in Persia.   Ali Akbar Khan, who appears  to be identical  with  Moharned A. Khan,  correspondent  of  the  &quot; NewOrient,&quot; has recently issued  a leaflet  entitled &quot; To the  Partisans of right,&quot; which  is the appeal of  the  Persian  Nationalist  Party for independence.    A Persian Association has recently been opened  in Constantinople,which  would appear to have been organised for the purposes of  Pan-Islamic propaganda not only in Constantinople, but possibly also inEgypt  and India.   Syed  Muhammed Tewfik and  Professor Effendi,the  well-known  Persian Pan-Islamist,  are  connected  with  themovement.    Central Asia. The object of  the mission of Afghans andKazim Beg to Moscow is to create Bolshevik-Mohammedan solidarityin Asia and  to ruin the  British Empire  by the  destruction  of its power  in the Middle and Near East.   The programme devised at theBolshevik-Afghan Conference at  Moscow  is  to win over Persia toBolshevism and pan-Islamism  by means of peaceful propaganda; ifthis fails,  Persia is to be invaded  by an  army  of  150,000  mencomposed of Afghans, Central Asiatic  Moslems  and Chinese  mer-cenaries, whilst at the same time  the Afghans and  frontier tribes areto attack India, and the Turks are to  cause risings to  break out inKurdistan.   It is clear, therefore, if this information is correct, that more than usually  violent Bolshevik  propaganda  may  shortly beexpected in Persia.    It is reported that some of the Bolshevik propaganda in Turkestanis being directed by  Germans, who in their  proclamations  declare that the Emperor William is a holy Hadji who is  going to save the moslems from the Christian yoke, ie., from the British, French and russian officers.  Meanwhile, the Afghans have assumed an almost complete administrative control in Turkestan and it is reported thatthey are secretly assuring  the Turcomans that ultimately they them-selves  will support them against the  Bolsheviks.   This tends  to confirm a report that the Amir of Afganistanis absorbed in a schemefor  the. confederation of  the  Mohammedans  of Central Asia under his  rule, and that  he is  merely  playing  with the Bolsheviks, andpossibly also  with the Young Turks.   The Bolsheviks  are reported  to be  becoming  increasingly dis-trustful of the designs of the Afghans in Central Asia.  It is certainthat the Afghans have refused  to support the Bolshevik doctrine ofland ownership and,  at  a recent  meeting  at Merv, the  Afghan
delegates announced their intention of  laying this matter  before the moslem Soviet at Tashkent.  The  Afghans are  also interfering  withthe Bolshevik methods of conscription and commandeering of supplies,are insisting upon the release of political prisoners and upholding therights  of  the local  people  against the  Bolshevik agents.   ManyTurcomans seem to think  that the Afghans have  come  to stay inTurkestan and  attribute their presence to British instigation.   It isstated  that   they  would  prefer Afghan  to  Bolshevik rule.    TheTashkent  Soviet evidently fears  the  increasing influence  of the afghans, as it has appointed a special  Commissar with orders to counteract their influence by stopping the usual methods of tyrannyemployed  by Bolshevik agents.  In addition, Baraktulla has recentlyleft Moscow for Tashkent at the  urgent request of  the  TurkestanSoviet  authorities.   The  Amir of Bokhara continues to buy rifles at high prices  and so far does not appear to have replied to Lenin&apos;invitation to  send an  envoy to Moscow.   Meanwhile the SovietGovernment continues to send agents to spread Bolshevik propagandathroughout Asia.  They appear largely to travel as pilgrims.    China. There is   information  that  Bolshevism  is  making progress in  China, where  there is always inflammable material totake fire.    Money which is ostensibly intended  for the purpose of relieving the wants of indigent German families in China, is being  sent  fromGeimany  to an organisation at Tsing-Tau.  This organisation  is in reality a.bureau established for the purposes of  German propaganda and commercial espionage.    Japan. A bomb outrage occurred at a  recent entertainmentgiven in Tokio by the Minister  for Foreign Affairs in honour of theEmperor&apos;s birthday.  It is suggested that the outrage was designed asa protest  by the poor against the flaunting extravagance of the rich,for, in spite of the  apparent calm which reigns  in Japan, beneath the surface there is a  good  deal of unrest which  is largely  due to thehigh price of rice.   There has recently  been a marked increase in thesale of revolutionary literature, the works of  Karl Marx being in large demand.    It is reported that a Vice-Admiral and a Captain took part in themeeting of  the men of the Naval Dockyards, held on the 13th Sep-tember, to select two representatives to attend the Labour Conferenceat  Washington.  The pay of the  naval  dockers at Kobe and  Kurehas recently been  increased by 60  per  cent,  to 100  per cent, andat the former place an eight hours day has also been granted. these concessions  were made to men who had not joined the strikers andwere  applicable to strikers who returned to work before a certain date.  During the  strike many workmen did not actually stop  work,for fear of the police law which forbids strikes; they merely  idled.The new word for this form of striking is &quot; Taigyo.&quot;    A  report  from  Geneva to the effect that  Japanese  agents are endeavouring to enlist Swiss  officers and N.C.O&apos;s. for service in theJapanese Army is  officially denied by the Japanese.   At the  sametime, it is  reported  that  there are at present an  unusually  largenumber of Japanese diplomats and agents in Switzerland.
-    Australia. The  Commonwealth  Treasurer,  Mr.  Watt,  has given permission for Federal action to be taken to check the circula- tion  of  disloyal Irish propaganda within the Commonwealth.  Mr. Watt declared to a deputation which waited upon him on the subject of sedition that, although he was personally in favour of Home Rule, he considered that preaching the disruption  of the Empire should be forbidden.  The Irish Race Convention, which was  recently held at Melbourne, agreed to support de Valera and to open an Australian- Irish fund.   It is reported that  Mr. Ryan, ex-Premier of Queensland, and Archbishops Kelly and Mannix, have each  subscribed  100 to this fund.    It is reported  that  a  Conference of  the   Employers&apos; Labour Federation held on the 12th of November recommended the following policy: The continuance of Arbitration Tribunals;  the  fixing by Parliament  of weekly working  hours; the adoption of the Whitley scheme and  a modified system  of  profit-sharing where practicable; payment by results; unemployment insurance by general  Common- wealth taxation ; State assistance for employers  to purchase houses; Commonwealth legal endowment for children under fourteen years of age in cases where the wages of their  parents do not exceed a stipulated amount.    Meanwhile, the gas workers of Victoria have  come  out on strike and it is reported that Mr. Hughes has gone to  Melbourne in order to  try to settle the strike  in that  city, together with  that of the engineers and engine drivers who have also ceased work.    Enraged by the republication of verses written at the time of the Boer War,  in which  the  troops were  described in  contemptuous terms, some soldiers have tarred and feathered a man who was stated to be the author.   Their victim was  a  Labour member of the House of Representatives.   The verses have been published in a leaflet by the  Nationalists, who hope thereby  to  induce soldiers  to  vote anti-Labour.    New Zealand. The New Zealand General  Election takes place on the 17th December and the Labour Party are  putting up a  hard fight, but find war sentiment a serious obstacle.   The official Labour Candidate  at Christchurch  described the  Labour Party&apos;s attitude during the war as one of dignified neutrality.  The Liberal Candidate, Mr. Bull, when asked if he favoured the restoration of political rights to conscientious objectors, replied &quot; Yes, if you bring back my  dead mates from France.&quot;   South Africa. Hertzog still continues his violent attacks on the &quot; Imperialistic  policy  and  subservience of  the  Government.&quot;General Smuts has a difficult position to face because there appearsto be a revulsion of Dutch feeling against the co-operation of dutch and British which was secured by General  Botha during  the  war.South  Africa  has  a long way  to travel before  effective  politicaldivisions on other than racial lines will become practicable.   At a  recent meeting of the Church Socialist   League in LondonMr. Sol.  T.  Plaatje spoke on the subject  of  the condition  of  the natives of South Africa and their legal disabilities.   It  is reportedthat the  meeting received Mr. Plaatje&apos;s statement with surprise  and
indignation that such intolerable oppression should be countenancedwithin the Empire  and  urged the  Imperial  Parliament to take action to remedy the injustice.  References to this speech have beenmade in the &quot; New York Tribune.&quot;    West Indies-Barbados.-Whereas a  certain  amount  of unrest does  exist  among the coloured  population of Barbados, .and returned  soldiers of the B.W.I. Regiment together with repatriatedsailors provide a  discontented element, nevertheless a general revoltis held  to be improbable, the better class native  being too religiousand loyal to the  Crown to favour any  concerted  measure againstauthority. The American propaganda paper the &quot; Negro World &quot; hasa &quot;wide  circulation,  but it is believed  that  it  does not exercise  abaneful  influence; rather is it  probable that  such literature willcreate greater  satisfaction with British rule when  it is  seen underwhat disabilities the negro suffers  in America.  For this reason it isnot thought  advisable to pass  legislation similar to that introduced into the Straits Settlements and Demarara to prohibit the publication and importation of seditious printed matter.    Canada. It is impossible to overstate the good that has resulted from the  Prince of Wales&apos; visit.    The municipal elections  at Winnipeg resulted  in  the  defeat ofthe Radicals, although  in some of the wards the polling was fairlyclose. Had  the Labour  Party  been successful, it  was intended toreinstate  the policemen and officials implicated in the strike and to relieve from  civic  taxation all property owners  assessed at  less  than600 dollars.    Sir  Robert  Borden has  made  a speech at  Ottawa in  which  heforeshadowed the  probability of employees being represented on theboard of management  of  the  Government  Railways,   Such  aproposal, he  declared, would receive his entire sympathy.    Judge Lafontaine, President of the  Catholic School  Board ofMontreal, has refused  to  receive a deputation  representing  the teachers&apos; Welfare Association  on the ground that the Association ispreaching anarchy and paving the way for Bolshevism.  There  isconsiderable friction  between the Board and  the teachers, chieflyowing to the demands of  the latter for higher salaries.     A demonstration, in which it is reported  that 10,000 people took part, was recently  held  by the Jewish  population of Montreal to protest against  the alleged pogroms in the Ukraine and Poland.     Mexico. It is only since  Carranza succeeded in  establishinghis government that it has been possible  to distinguish any differencebetween  his system of administration and  that of his predecessors.From the first it was clear that the members of his government were determined to make personal profit by despoiling those who possessedno means of defence, but there was nothing  unusual about this in Mexico.   It soon  became apparent, however, that he and his principal supporters were in favour of an ill-defined, but none the less resolute policy of violence against Society, and advocated a Bolshevik pro-  , gramme  which, regarding respectability as a crime, aimed  at ousting the better classes from their possessions and robbing  them of  their
influence  and authority.  Circumstances have  prevented the fullrealisation of these extremist plans, hut it  is obvious that Carranzaand  his military lieutenants, the majority of  whom  are men of  the lowest origin and of  the most evil  reputation, are neither able norwilling to establish an orderly form  of government.   Carranza, at the present time, is  said to be endeavouring to induceAmerican negro soldiers to enter the Mexican Army. &apos; In connectionwith this run our  it is  interesting  to note that  a negro attorney isreported  to have laid before the Foreign Relations Committee of  the senate plans which have been drawn up for the establishment of  anegro state to be situated partly within the United States and partlywithin Mexico.   There is  no doubt  that  many of the leaders amongthe negroes are now in Mexico and  that the country  is a hot-bed forextremist propaganda of all kinds.   The necessity for  armed  inter-vention by the United States  in Mexico is being urged by the Hearstnewspapers.   However, the last note which the United States Govern-ment has addressed to  Mexico on the question of the release of  theAmerican Consul, Mr. Jenkins, though  severe is not of  the nature ofan ultimatum and there are  no indications as yet what course  theUnited  States will  pursue if Mexico refuses to comply with  herdemand.                       South America.   Peru.-Our  correspondent, writing under  date  October lothreports that during  the  last  month strikes  have been  of dailyoccurrence;  they have included strikes of the Central and  SouthernRailways, tramways,  light and power supplies, textiles, dockmen,watermen, clerks, printers and telephone operators.  To settle  the strikes the Government has made use of one of the new Constitutionallaws approved  by  the last  plebiscite.  The law  lays  down thatdisputes between  Lahour and Capital must be referred to compulsory arbitration and that all labourers must go back to work.   The decreehas proved up to  the present effective and as practically all  classes ofLabour have obtained large increases of wages a period of quiet is not improbable.   British  interests, however, consider the law  as  likelyto prove unsatisfactory to them, and the Peruvian Corporation, beingdissatisfied with the settlement of  the  Southern  Railway Strike, willprobably resist  the decision  of  the Arbitration Board, claiming thatthe Board  was composed  of  ignorant  local  men  who  were  notcompetent to understand the business questions involved.   Brazil. The police in Rio de Janeiro continue to exercise greatvigilance in  regard to Maximalist  propaganda.   Frequent raids havebeen made in search of seditious literature, and  all foreigners foundto.be engaged in propaganda work have been sentenced to deportation.The embarkation  of four Spanish and  two  Portuguese agitators wasmade the  occasion to attempt to hold a large protest meeting on their behalf, but  the gathering  was  broken up by the police,  and  theringleaders  arrested.   In  its  action  the Government  is  receivingwarm support, from the press, which points out the growing danger ofthe Maximalist movement, and urges  the Government to  initiate a
co-ordinated policy whereby the measures now employed in Eio deJaneiro itself should be applied to the various States.   Germans from Spain are continuing to emigrate to South Americaand in particular to Brazil.   Argentine. There  appears  to  be little  doubt  that PresidentIrigoyen will obtain a large  majority in the elections  which  are totake place in March,  He  has  obtained  the  support of the Church,which is an important asset, especially in the City of  Buenos Aires.The Banco Germanico has supplied him  with a large  sum of money for his  election  expenses  and it is reported that it has also lent himsums amounting to 4,100,000 dollars for his  private use.   Althoughthe troubles at the port of Buenos Aires still  continue, the Federa-tion  Obrera  Maritima is considered to have  lost ground, and theindustrial  situation  throughout the country,  except  at Mendozawhere a state of anarchy is reported to exist, is calm.   The organisa-tion  known as &quot;Liga Patriotica Argentina,&quot; which was  formed to combat Bolshevism early in the year, appears to be gaining strengthand its propaganda is  said to be successful.   A projected loan  of  100,000,000 dollars to Germany is  still a subject  of discussion.                           PART II.   United  States of  America-The  Presidents message to congress was entirely devoted to the industrial unrest  in  the UnitedStates, and, for the time being at any rate, the  Peace Treaty and theLeague of Nations appear to have been relegated to the background.The  message  probably reflects public  opinion   fairly  accurately.Domestic questions are  too absorbing  for  the  ordinary Americancitizen to take much  interest in the rearrangement of the map ofEurope, or to worry himself as to whether  his  country is  taking herproper share in the reconstruction of the world.  While recognising the  existence of a &quot;Bed  Peril,&quot;  the President  evidently  does not regard it as a  fundamental  problem in  American politics.  It is adisease which requires drastic treatment, but, if the malady is to becured effectively, it is necessary to recognise the  underlying  causes which have led to its growth and to prevent their recurrence.   ThePresident, therefore, lays down the  obvious doctrine that in certain cases the Government,  in the interest  of the  whole  community, is justified in intervening in a strike, but insists that  the time has arrived when  the  State must recognise the necessity for allowingemployees to bargain collectively with their  employers.   It will beremembered that the refusal of  the  employers  in the  United  states to agree  to  this  principle  was the rock  upon which  the  recentIndustrial Conference at Washington came to grief.    From  the tone of the  Presidents  message political  observerssuggest  that  the  chief   feature  in the  forthcoming  presidential election will probably be an effort on  the  part of the older  partiesto outbid  the  new Labour  . Party  and  the  Socialists in  theattractiveness of their programmes of industrial reform,    Meanwhile, the Government is waging a determined war againstthe Extremists, who are mainly aliens.   The raid which was recently
270  (  carried  out by  the Department of Justice upon Anarchists and  adherents of the Industrial Workers of the World is the most severe  blow which has yet been  struck against the forces of  disorder.   An  official  statement  shows   that  most  of  the  arrested  men were  members of the  Union of Russian Workers and included Remen  Moschiok, one of the organisers of the  Union.  Two  anarchists,  Alonen and Piavio, have been convicted  and  imprisoned for criminal  anarchy and will be  deported  to  Finland upon the  expiration  of  their  sentences.   These are  the  two  first  convictions  under the  Criminal Anarchy Act of New  York States which was  passed  in  1902 after  the assassination of  President  McKinley.  Congress has  passed almost  unanimously a Bill to extend for one year after the  declaration  of Peaca the Bill for the control, during the period of the  war, of the  issue of  passports to aliens,  and  a new Anti-Syndicalist  Bill is under consideration which would subject to federal prosecu  tion persons exhibiting the Red Flag or  advocating principles which  involve the  overthrow  of the Government.     The activities  of the Extremists have  created a natural appre-  hension among the Conservative elements in the population.  The  republican  gains  at various local elections  are attributed to  the  strong instinct  for law and order which exists in the United States.  The election of Mr. Calvin  Coolidge as Governor of  the  State  of  Massachusetts  with a majority of 100,000 votes is regarded as a  significant reply to the police strikers in  Boston.   He had vigorously  denounced the conduct of the police, whereas his  opponent, Mr. Long,  a democrat, has espoused their came.  The shooting outrage at  the  Armistice Day Parade at Centralia, Washington State, which resulted in the  death of six ex-soldiers, and was  alleged  to have been com- mitted by members of  the  Industrial Workers of the World, caused intense indignation and led to violent reprisals, the citizens announcing their determination to rid  their town of  the &quot;Reds.&quot;   The local secretary of  the Industrial Workers of the World was lynched.  The moral  of  the American Army is  stated to  be  excellent, and  the &quot;American Legion,&quot;  a  new association  of  veterans  of the war, is carrying on a vigorous anti-Bolshevik campaign.    The police raids  on the Extremists  have produced  a mass  of inflammatory documents, which prove  conclusively the  Bolshevik origin of the present disturbances in America.   The deportation  of Martens, the head  of the Russian  Bureau,  and  Bolshevik &quot; Ambas- ambassador&quot; to the United States of America, is considered probable as  a result of the investigations of the Lusk Committee.  His correspon- dence  with  the  Soviet Government at Moscow is said  to prove clearly that  the object of his  propaganda  in  New York was to * establish  a Communist  regime.  It  is stated that he  was in com- munication with 2,500  American firms,  the  managers of many of which he had asked to  urge their political  representatives  to insist upon the lifting of  the  Russian blockade.  The  Soviet  Government has  addressed  a note  to   the  State Department  at  Washington protesting against the arrest of  Martens, and threatening reprisals.    The agitation among the coloured population continues.  &quot;Theeducation of the negroes in the revolutionary movement,&quot; which theIndustrial Workers of the World claim to have taken in hand threeyears ago, has been  extremely successful,&quot;judging from the fact that
the negro membership of that organisation in New York alone is nowsaid to amount to 110,000.   A recent report of a Committee of the senate appointed to enquire into racial  disturbances has reportedthat during the  past year there  have been  as  many as thirty-eightracial riots, that the negroes throughout  the  country are arming to free themselves from their &quot; oppressors,&quot; and that the radical element in  the black  population,  which  works in  conjunction  with whiteagitators, is gaining ground.   That the agitation among the colouredraces is not confined to the negroes is proved by the formation of anAfro-Asiatic League, which  has for  its purpose  the co-ordination of revolutionary activity from the Straits Settlements to Agadir.   &quot; not all  the might of  Europe or the League of Damnations will be able to stop the onslaught for freedom,&quot;  to quote  the  words  of &quot;TheCrusader,&quot; a newspaper which also  announces the formation of yet another  coloured organisation, &quot; The  African Blood Brotherhood for african  Liberation and Redemption,&quot; the membership of which is limited  to those &quot; who are willing  to go the limit.&quot;  Meanwhilereligious  bodies seventy-five  religious  denominations are  said tohave  been represented at  a recent  Conference at  New York whichenquired into  the subject are interesting themselves in the status and future of  the coloured races.  The Baptists especially are  doing their  utmost  to promote  the  movement  towards  Africa,  and  a newspaper,   The Baptist World,&quot; is now published, which  appearsto  be  doing  its utmost  to introduce  revolutionary methods andrace hatred  in  Africa.   Dr.  Moses,  one  of its  editors,  claims that the  Baptist Church has a communion  of five  millions and thatthe paper would constitute an international propaganda against GreatBritain&apos;s policy  in Africa.   Coloured Baptist Ministers are being sentto  &quot; the  Fatherland.&quot;  It  is suggested  that the  United States ofAmerica should assume a  mandate  over  German West Africa, and establish a negro state of which  Colonel  Theodore Roosevelt, son ofthe late  President, should be the first Governor-General.    The  report of the Senate&apos;s  Committee of  Enquiry on the SteelStrike states that the living conditions and wages of the steel  workers are satisfactory and attributes the  duration and  bitterness of thestrike  to the fact that the American Federation of Labour had allowedits direction to pass into the  hands  of the extremists.   The  strikereceived the active support  of the I.W.W. and the  Rand School. TheCommittee&apos;s recommendations for the preservation of industrial peaceinclude the establishment of a Commission for the Settlement of LabourProblems, the Americanisation of foreign-born  citizens and aliens; the deportation of aliens who have not  become American citizens after five years&apos; residence and legislation for the suppression of anarchists.    In spite of the  settlement of the strike, there  appears to be stillconsiderable unrest among the steel workers, and  the failure of thestrike of longshoremen and  the deadlock in  the coal dispute arecausing  considerable bitterness within the ranks of organised labour.The railwaymen are also reported to  be dissatisfied with  the labourclauses in the Cummins Railway Bill and are claiming an  increaseof wages to all branches.    It  would appear that the attention of  Labour is now being turnedtowards politics.  The United States  Labour  Convention,  recentlyheld at Chicago, has resulted in the  formation of  a National Labour
Party.  The Party proposes &quot; to organise all hand  and brain workers of the country in support of  the  principles  of political, social, andindustrial  democracy.&quot;   Women are  to  have equal  representationwith men, and the Party proposes to nominate candidates at the nextPresidential Election.   Its programme is practically State Socialism,and the intention of its  founders  is to force organised labour, theagrarian extremists and the members of the  old  Socialist Party into one fold.   Meanwhile, the Farmers&apos;  organisation,  &quot; The  NationalGrange,&quot; representing 600,000 farmers, has decided by a  big majorityto  refuse Mr.  Gomper&apos;s  invitation to join the ranks of  organised labour, and has expressed its intention of  standing with the property owners should a class struggle arise.    The  United   States  Labour  Convention  passed  a  resolutionapproving the Plumb plan for Government ownership of railways andalso decided to recognise the Irish  Republic.   The Irish propagandacontinues.   A meeting  was recently held in New York by Sinn Feinorganisations,  including the &quot; Friends  of  Irish Freedom &quot; and  the&quot; United Irish American  Societies,&quot; at which protests were  made against the British   military  autocracy  in  Ireland.    The BritishGovernment was arraigned as the enemy of humanity and civilisation.On the whole, however, the Irish extremists seem to be losing ground.At Portland, Oregon, the &quot; American Legion &quot; tore three Irish flagsfrom the motor cars in  which  Ue Valera and  his companions weretravelling and objected to the  Irish flag being placed  on an equality with  that  of  the United States.   In  Chicago the flag of  the irish republic  was  not allowed  to  be carried  through the streets.  UeValera has explained  that his loan for  2,000,000/.  is  not one forinvestors, but for patriots who are  willing to give a free gift of their money.  The  popularity  of  the loan is not  likely to be  excessive.I)e Valera is said to have expressed his pleasure at the arrival of the ulster deputation and to be anxious for a public debate.    The Germans are becoming more active and are displaying a keeninterest  in  political  affairs.  It is said that  the Germans on the pacific coast are  especially active.   The tendency is for  the Germanand Irish  sections  of  the  population to  unite.   The  industrial workers of the World  are  also keen  to  obtain  German adherents.Bill Hay wood, who is one of their principal organisers in this  work,is  reported  to  have  remarked,  &quot; We  are  organizing Chinamen,Hottentots, Americans, Irish  and all  the   rest Why   not theGermans ?&quot;  Commercially the Germans are  also active.   There is evidence that the  Kerr Steamship Company is really a cloak for thecontinued existence of  the Hamburg-American Line.   Many of the servants of  the Hamburg-American Line are employed by the KerrSteamship  Company,  whose Vice-Piesident,  Mr. A. E.  Clegg, aBritish subject, is reported to have  been anti-British during the war.    The Hearst Press  continues its violent anti-British  propaganda and is producing daily  sensational  articles with alluring titles suchas &quot; Egypt  bound to  Cruel British Masters  by Subtle Clause inTreaty.&quot;  It has also started a pro-German  campaign on  the film.For this  purpose  it  has  purchased  the  &quot;international&quot;  and&quot; Universal &quot;News Services.    Reliable information has been received that a  secret  meeting ofthe Executive  Committee of the American Communist  Party was to
be held in Washington on the 15th November at which  representa-tives from Scandinavia, France and England were expected.  At thismeeting definite plans are to be formulated to establish permanentNational Propaganda Bureaux which are to be always in touch with each other.  The  Communist Party  have already  decided  to  sendduly accredited representatives to Stockholm, Paris, London, berlin and  Holland.   Ashkenizi  has been deputed  for  Stockholm, andGourwich is to go either to France or  Switzerland.   Other candidateswill be nominated at the secret conference.   The task of these Bureaux will be  to obtain and forward to theUnited States detailed information about the revolutionary movement and the plans laid by the Communist  Parties  which participated inthe Third International in Moscow.   Evan Chabrow is now in  Stockholm where he is representing theAmerican Labour  Party officially, and the  American  CommunistParty unofficially.   He  has  been supplied by the American Com-munist Party with documents  and a  photograph with the signature of the National. Secretary of the American Communist Party.   Nuorteva, Martin&apos;s  right-hand  man, is busy with plans to help the Bolshevik Government  in  Russia financially  and  morally  by sending food into Russia.   International Labour Conference  in the  UnitedStates.-The International Labour  Conference has now closed  itslabours at Washington, which have resulted in 5 draft  Conventionsto be submitted to the legislators of  the  40 States which composedthe Conference.  The Conventions briefly are:      1. The  establishment of the principle of the  8 hour day and           48 hour week.  This principle met with the opposition of           the  employers.    Mr.  Conrad,  I.L.G. (Switzerland)           threatened  the  withdrawal of  the  labour  delegates if           their  suggestions  continued  to  meet  with a hostile           reception.   :  2. The  establishment of a minimum age  of  14 years for the           employment  of  children.    With  regard   to   certain           Eastern  countries the application of this principle will           be by stages.     3. The prohibition of night work for  women and young people.     4. The submission by each State  every three months of  data  on           unemployment.     5. Six weeks&apos;rest before and 6  weeks after childbirth on full           pay.     The  Conference has ruled that these  Conventions  must  besubmitted to Parliament within  one year.  A number of recom-mendations  were also   passed, including State insurance  againstunemployment  and  the reservation  of  certain public works  for periods of unemployment.     The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; has devoted some space to the Conference,and its correspondent in America has gathered the impression thatthe Delegates were genuinely inspired by a desire to raise the planeof industrial life.  During the discussions of the Conference a protest
was made by the Workers  group that Portugal,  Eoumania, Persia,Siam,  China,  and 11  South American States had  failed  to  namenon-Government Delegates, and had thus decreased the proportionalvoting of workers, but their grievance was met by an explanation that provision had  been  made  in  the  Peace Treaty to allow of labour in  non-represented  States being  able, nevertheless,  to  exercise its vote.   A protest was also entered by the La tin-American delegates,who complained that the Conference instead of being internationalhad become a European concern.  This grievance was met, as regardsthe proposed Commission on  Migration, by an arrangement wherebyEurope constituted but one-half of the membership of the Commission.    The International Labour Conference dealt with the membership of the governing body of the proposed International Labour Office.The following  twelve  Governments  will send representatives:Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Germany, Switzerland,Spain, Argentina, Canada, Poland and Denmark; the  last named will only be represented pending  the appointment of  the United Statesdelegate.  The workers&apos; representatives will be M. Jouhaux, France;M.  Oudegeest,  Holland ;   Mr. Stuart Buuning,  Great  Britain;M. Lindquist,  Switzerland; a German representative, name not yetreported, and  Mr. Draper, Canada; the latter  pending the appoint-ment of an American.   The  employers are M. Guerin, France; SirAllan  Smith,   Great  Britain;  Signor  Pirelli,  Italy; M.  Carlier,Belgium; M.  Hodacz, Czecho-Slovakia; and M. Schindler, Switzer-land;  the  latter pending  the appointment of an American.   TheChinese and Indian delegates have protested against the allocation  ofthe 24 seats, and declare that this arrangement leaves one-half of thetotal inhabitants of  the globe unrepresented, e.y., the Far-Easternpeoples.   Eegret has been expressed in the American press that the UnitedStates  Government was not represented at the Conference.  german delegates were also  absent, this Germany explained  by stating thather delegates  had not been able to obtain a passage to America.   Itis believed that the  next  meeting of  the International Labour Con-ference will be held at the seat of the League of Nations.
                THE  BALTIC  SITUATION.        Events leading up  to  bermont&apos;s attack on Riga.   In  order  to  understand the inner history of recent  activities in theBaltic Provinces, it is  necessary to trace  the course of outward eventssince November, 1918.   When  the Armistice was signed on  the 11th November  last year, itwas laid down that the German troops &apos;in  the East should be withdrawnfrom Russia  as  soon as the Entente  issued instructions to that effect.Instead of complying with this condition the German Government pro-ceeded to withdraw its  troops at once, and during their retreat every endeavour was  made to assist the  Bolsheviks, who advanced as  theGermans retired, and to cripple the resistance of  the small Baltic States,Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Meanwhile, an army was being recruitedby the Baltic Barons, the former  landowning class in these States, whoare largely German in race and completely German in sympathy, but onlyform a small minority (less than 10 per cent.) of the population,-with theidea that when the Baltic States had been overrun by the Red Army, theBarons (or Baits) with the connivance and possibly the co-operation of theGerman Government, should step in  to rescue  their country from theBolsheviks and substitute the influence of  Germany.   This plan failed, asthe Baltic  States proved  able  to rescue themselves by their own efforts,but part of the German army under Von der Goltz remained in Latvia, andwas reinforced by the Bait troops under such leaders as Fletcher. In April theGermans and Baits, seeing their first scheme had broken down, endeavoured to seize power by a coup tVetat executed in Libau and  the setting  up ofa Bait Government of  Latvia, but this proved a failure.  In June anotherattempt was  made to  break  down  the  independence of  the new baltic states  (whose  troops  were  then victoriously  advancing  against  theBolsheviks)  by  a  treacherous attack against their rear  executed byFletcher&apos;s  Corps  of the Bait Army, but this was also defeated, largely-as the  Baits  themselves admit in their orders, copies.of which  are atpresent in British hands-owing to the intervention of the Allied military mission in the Baltic States under General Gough.   Since  that  time  theGerman Government have been requested  to  withdraw the troops ofVon der Goltz back to Germany, and  they have  indeed more than  onceissued orders to this effect, but Von der Goltz, on behalf of his men, whohad been  promised land concessions  in the country, has  so far evadedcarrying out  these orders on any and  every conceivable pretext.  despite the fact that  the German  Government  has now declared that it will nolonger take any responsibility with  regard to  the pay, equipment, orsupply of  this army, it still remains in the Baltic States; and it is certainthat it has been retained there for almost  a  year after the signing of theArmistice  in order to cover and secure the  preparation of the new forceformed of  Russians and Germans under Bermont.    During the  first week in October, bermont&apos;s force, which  had been largely recruited from the Frei-Korps, took over the outpost line  whichVon der Goltz&apos;s  men had been holding.  Seeing danger to themselves,the Letts opposed the relief and thus  gave the required  pretext for the attack on  Riga.  On the day before the attack, the formation in Berlin ofa  &quot; West Russian&quot; Government almost  entirely  composed  of pro-German Russians was announced.  This Government officially declaredits intention of converting the portions of courland occupied by Bermontinto  a base  for the Military  and Political  Liberation of Russia  fromBolshevism.
              The Formation of bermont&apos;s Force.   A  system for germanizing the Baltic  Provinces  which appears  tohave existed as early as 190o received considerable impetus during theoccupation by Von der GohVs troops.  Some of the Baltic Barons wereeven induced to give up part of their  lands, at  one-third of their value,in order to encourage would-be colonists ; and an agreement was signedbetween the Germans and the Lettish Government on the 29th December,1918, by which all German volunteers who had been engaged for not lessthan four weeks in protecting Latvia from the Bolsheviks, were to obtainLettish naturalisation.;   As soon as the collapse came in the West,  large quantities of warmaterial were immediately  transferred  by the Military Party largelyunder the leadership of Bischoff to the Baltic  Provinces, and  since theArmistice, the  supply of military equipment has been kept up by officersin charge of depots, who have acted independently and on  their own initiative.  A few weeks ago Bermont  was said to be in possession of sufficient supplies to last him a year.   In July, when it  became clear that the Entente  would eventuallyinsist on the recall of Von der Goltz and his Army, the  latter institutedan enquiry to determine how many of  his troops  would be willing- toenter Colonel bermont&apos;s service.  Only  about  half, however, expressed their willingness to join, since they could only be guaranteed pay for aperiod of three months.  This fact and other evidence tend  to  show thatBermont is not in possession of extensive funds.  It is known that theFrei-Korps,  prior to  the  departure  of  Von der  Goltz,  had  been considerably over-drawing its budget, but it is uncertain how much ofthis  money had  been  placed at the disposal  of  Bermont.   There is,however, definite evidence that the latter has received funds from certainGerman financiers, amongst whom Krupp  and Siemens-Schuckert are mentioned ; and it; is also rumoured that he has obtained financial support from Japan.   Bermont himself is described as a  picturesque Cossack of the &quot; WildWest&quot; type, of good family, impressionable and very vain, but extremelypopular with his  men.   A regular officer of junior rank in the russian army, he was promoted to Colonel during operations in the Ukraine.  Atpresent, he has marked anti-British sentiments,  as he thinks that he hasnot been treated with the  consideration  due to him by members of theBritish Mission.   bermont&apos;s staff was composed chiefly of Germans, and the officers ofhis force  were  either  Russian adventurers or Germans.   The  total strength  of the  purely Russian troops  was estimated at about 10.000,leaving a remainder of about 30,000  to 40,000 Germans, many of whom had  transferred  from Von der Goltz&apos;s  Corps.   The German troops wereactuated by varying motives in resisting the orders of  the Allies and theGerman Government.  Firstly, the majority of the troops formerly underthe  command of  Von der  Goltz  were merely adventurers,  who  hadno intention  of  resuming  regular work while there was a possibility of   &apos;leading a free and easy existence; and,  secondly, the  Trades Unions inGermany accused these men of having fought, in the interests of reaction,and  by refusing them admission, made it almost impossible for them toobtain civil employment.   In addition,  there seems little doubt that acertain section of the German Legion were genuinely convinced that theywere fighting iu the best interests  of their country, and that their recallfrom  the  Baltic  States would&quot; mean the  incursion of Bolshevism  into germany.   As regards the equipment of  bermont&apos;s force, there appear to havebeen  plenty of rifles, field guns, and ammunition, but  there was a greatlack of heavy artillery.
       Organisations in Berlin which assisted Bermont.   1. The West Russian Governm.ent.-The head of this Government,the formatiou of which was announced the day before Bermont attackedRiga, was a Russian named Biskupski, whose official title was &quot; repre-sentative in Berlin of the  West Government.&quot;  He controlled the fundswhich were used for  Ruseo-German  propaganda and  the  purchase ofmunitions for  bermont&apos;s force. &apos;  In a  statement  to  an  informant,Biskupski declared that Bermont was equipped entirely by private enter-prise and that Hcrr Tiesen and  Herr Hugo Stinnes coal magnates andKrupp of Essen were  mainly instrumental in supplying the  funds.  he further stated that,  up till  the end of October,  35,000,000 marks  hadalready beeu spent.  His aide-de-camp, Poensgen, who was the ablest andmost active agent of the West Russian Government in Berlin, was mainly responsible for a system of bribing railway officials, which made possiblethe transport of men and  supplies to the Baltic States.   As far as is known, the composition of  the West Russian Governmentwas  as follows:            President      ..       ..       ..   Biskupski.           Foreign        ..       ..       ..       ,,           Finance        ..       ..       ..   G. V. Berg.           War  ..       ..       ..       ..   Durnovo.           Interior        ..       ..       ..   Derjugine.           Agriculture    ..       ..       ..   Ziakin.           Education      ..        ..       ..   Poppe.           Trade ..       ..       ..       ..   Roemmer.           Justice        ..        ..       ..                 Transport     ..        ..       ..          2. The League for  the  Renaissance  of Russia.-This League, which has been working  for a  reactionary alliance between Germany and Russia, established  its headquarters  in Berlin.  It did much to prepare the  ground for bermont&apos;s adventure, and about six weeks ago received a sum of 10,000,000 marks for Russo-German propaganda in liberated Russia.    3. The  Anti-Bolshevik  League.-This League, which frequently meets in Berlin, ostensibly to  discuss internal anti-Bolshevik measures,  is known to have been engaged  in the despatch of munitions to Deuikin and money to Bermont.   Munitions  were obtained from Schilde in Berlin, and in this office both Krupp and Stiler have  their representatives.     The  leading members of  this  League are General  von Lettow- Vorbeck, Graf von Donau, Bogdanoff a Russian merchant from Rostow  and Podalinski formerly Governor of  South Russia.  Noske is also said to attend some of  the meetings, but it seems  certain that only matters dealing  with the internal situation are discussed in his presence, and that he was in no way connected with  the movement for supporting Bermont.       Attitude of Denikin  and Udenitch towards Bermont.     A few days after  his  initial attack  on Riga, Colonel Bermont sent a wireless message to General  Denikin in which he expressed  a  hope that he  (Bermont) might shortly  advance against  the  Bolsheviks and thus facilitate the progress of the Volunteer Army.  Denikin made no official declaration as to his attitude towards&apos; Bermont,  but there is definite evidence to show that the so-called West Russian Government and the &quot; League for the Renaissance of  Russia&quot; did all in their power to win over Denikin, for  which purpose-they  employed  the  services of the notorious Kojin of  the  pro-German gang in  Copenhagen.  They  claim that they obtained the support of Denikin&apos;s staff  and that  the General
alone wavered.   Furthermore, Colonel  Bermont wrote  to  Denikin to propose that he should break  with the Entente whose  policy towardsRussia,  more  especially  that of  England, Bermont  characterised as&quot; treason.&quot;   Udenitch visited Bermont in Riga at  the  end of September in an endeavour to persuade the latter to get rid of the German elemeut in hisforce and  to co-operate with the North-West Russian Army in a generaladvance on Petrograd.  This visit, however, proved a failure as Bermoutwas prevented from taking any such action by Von der Goltz.  Udeuitchsubsequently disavowed Bermont.               The pro-German Party in  Finland.   German influence is again at work in Finland.  Having  obtained theelection of  Stahlberg as President in order to prevent the taking of petrogard under  Entente  influence, the  pro-German  Party are  nowshowing signs of supporting the reactionaries under Mannerheim, who arein favour  of  Finnish intervention.   Possibly they see  in Mannerheim&apos;party a means of taking Petrograd  under German influence, Bermonfsexpedition having proved a failure.  Attitude  of the German Government and the  Policy of the                            &quot; Entente.&quot;   There  is every reason to believe that the German Government weresincere in their denial of  complicity in  the  Baltic  plot;  and  Baronvon Maltzahn-formerly attache at The Hague-who has recently taken over  the  Baltic Department  in  the  Foreign Office, appears  to begenuinely anxious to liquidate  the  Baltic  affair.   The announcement that  troops who remained in  Courland after the 11th November would lose all rights of German citizenship and all military claims, was probably due to his influence, and seems  to  have  had the desired effect.  On theother hand,   the police authorities, possibly through ignorance of   the true  state  of  affairs, proved  themselves  incapable  of dealing  withthe activities  of  the Military Party.   An example of their lack ofinitiative  was afforded by  the activities of the  Independent  SocialistParty, who,  by employing  agents, succeeded in exposing the organisa-tions in Beriin which  were  working for  Berroont.   Having obtainedcertain information,  the. party challenged the military anthorities to  raidthe offices of those  implicated, stating that if no action had been takenwithin twelve hours, they would publish their information in &quot; Freiheit.&quot;Two unsuccessful attempts were made by  the authorities to capture theringleaders  but  not before &quot;Freiheit&quot;  had published  its  information.The  effect of these unsuccessful raids was to  drive all the pro-Bermoutorganisations &quot; underground,&quot; which  made it  more  difficult to obtaindefinite information  concerning their activities.    The  German public and  even  a portion of the press seems to havebeen entirely under  a misapprehension as  to the  true state of affairs inthe Baltic provinces and they failed to realise that the blockade  wasnot a mere reprisal but was necessary in order to prevent the smugglingof supplies to bermont&apos;s troops.  Their point of view may be summarisedas follows :-      &quot; Troops were originally sent to the Baltic  States at the orders   of the Entente,- but, owing  to the  disorganised  state  of affairs in   Germany for which  the Entente&apos;s tardiness  in  making  peace  was   the main cause-these  troops  have  got out of hand.  The  Entente   is unable to send troops  to  carry out its instructions for  reasons   connected  with  internal  politics and  therefore  vents  its spite on   Germany by enforcing the blockade.&quot;
                      bermont&apos;s Intentions.   Bermont had  hoped  that  the Letts  would  make peace  with theBolsheviks and then turn against the Baltic Barons with the intentionof driving them  out of the  country.  This aggressive policy on thepart  of the Letts would have given Bermont an excuse to occupy thewhole  of  Lettland and  to carr) out his proposed attack on Petrogradas the liberator of  Russia from the Bolsheviks his ultimate objects beingconcessions in the Baltic Provinces, economic advantages connected withthe restoration of liberated Russia and possibly the  re-establishment ofa Monarchy in Russia and Germany.   But as  the  peace  proposals didnot mature, he attempted to justify his actions by  issuing false state-ments  in the press which made the Letts appear as the aggressors.   The advance of Udenitch  on  Petrograd  undoubtedly precipitatedthe operations against  Riga  and  it  would seem that Bermont if hecould not take Petrograd himself at least hoped to hamper the operations of the  North-West Russian Army by obliging it to send troops in supportof the Letts.  In this  connection it is interesting  to note that Leninsent a wireless message to  Bermont thanking him for the assistance he gave  to  the Red  troops during the  attack on  Petrograd by Udenitch;this has,  however, been  subsequently denied by Moscow.   Rccdiit events show thai  the  liquidation of   bermont&apos;s  force  is proceeding satisfactorily and  that he has now ceased to  be a menace to peace  in the Baltic States.His MAJESTIES.
