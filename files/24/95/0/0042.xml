His Britannic  iViajesty&apos;s Govdrnmentl                          Political Intelligence Department,   Confidential.                                      Foreign  Office.                                            Russia/029. The following reports by an exceptionally well-informedcorrespondent in South Russia have been  communicated  tothe Political Intelligence Department.   It must be under-stood that while they&quot;seem,to deserve a  wider  circulation,the opinions expressed are those of an unofficial  observerand the Department does not endorse thorn or in every  casevouch for the accurancy of statements made.pro-German Tendoncies .in Southern Russia.         ^^^^iTS^^^^1     At the present time, I gather, discontent, with the Allies is                                                        FTspreading in Southern Russia, and in very many cases the discontenttakes the form of a vague hope in the possibility of support fromGermany.  Nervousness-, weariness and ignorance account to a certain extent for this mood, but there are certain facts which encourageit and which have to be explained.  Even among well-informed and responsible men I have lately noticed considerable anxiety and. doubt,.as to the real nature of the Allies&apos; policy towards Russia.   I.seefew traces now of that blind and simple confidence in the goodwill and magical powers of the Allies&apos;that one so frequently met withduring the Revolution and in the early days of Bolshevism.  With manyof the best and most enlightened, loyalty to the Allies is temperedby a feeling that the Allies have been only incompletely loyal tcRussia and have been swayed toe frequently by influences unfriendlyto the Russian cause.   The experience of our vacillations has beenbitter and disillusioning.  There is real gratitude for the helpactually given, but there is no certainty that this aid represents a permanent, considered and integral policy in regard to Russia.     The following are the facts which at the present moment arestimulating discontent and uncertainty     la   The retreat of Admiral Kolchak who has now left Omsk andhas retired to Irkutsk.  I am told that Admiral Kolchak recently .sent to  General Denikin a despairing telegram in which he saidthat the^Allies were giving him nc real and effective support, and
asking whether It were not time to consider the question of a resumption of relations with Germany.    General Denikin repliedthat he considered the question wholly inopportune.  But the fact remains that some prominent peoplehere consider the indeterminatecharacter of the Allies1&apos;  policy as at least in part responsible forKolchak&apos;s failure.     In this connection it is worth while to note the views of IvlajorTakahishi, the newly-arrived Japanese Military Attache as privatelyexpressed in conversation with a well-known journalist here.  He says that the desire of Japan to be on good terms with a strong regeneratedRussia is due to the conviction that not many years will pass beforeJapan is at war with America.  Japan is afraid of American policyin China and the Far East generally and wishes to have in Asia astrong power that will back her.  The repeated offers of assistancein the struggle against Bolshevism are not inspired by petty con-cession hunting, but by broad motives of national policy.     2.  The evacuation of Archangel.   A number of refugees havearrived here from Archangel, many of them embittered against theBritish because cf the hasty evacuation of Archangel.  Their storyhas a disturbing effect and in a minor degree the psychologicalimpression caused.by the evacuation of Archangel is to be  comparedwith that produced by the French evacuation of Odessa.     3o  The Allied policy in.the Baltic Provinces.  The growingirritation caused by the uncertainty of tho Allies&apos; policy in  theBaltic, - their painful efforts to make independent States  ofEsthonia and Latvia, the confused tangle of incidents connectedwith von der C-oltz and Bermont,  and more particularly by the &quot;pressureGeneral Harsh brought to bear on General Yudenich to induce him torecognise the independence of Esthonia - has been sharply  accentuated by the failure of Yudenich whose Petrograd expedition roused a tumult
of hopes and fears.   It must be emphasised very strongly that  the unity of Russia is the cardinal article of faith here,  and that thepolicy - originally Franco-British, now specifically and almostpurely British - of encouraging the aspirations of Esthonians,Letts and Lithuanians for complete independence is regarded notonly as futile, but as highly dangerous to Russian interests.   this attitude is not confined to monarchists or reactionaries.  It  isshared by Radicals and Socialists, by all patriotic Russians in fact,who support General denikin&apos;s effort.  Far from ending, this policyis regarded as impeding the struggle with Bolshevism.  It blunts thepoint of the sword, it substitutes unsatisfactory, insincerepolitical compromise for direct military action.  The encouragement of Esthonia and Latvia that might have been admitted as a necessarytemporary expedient is to all appearance being elevated into apermanent article of policy,  and the growing habit of pampering bydiplomatic assurances and financial and military assistancenationalities that never can be states is regarded by many Russiansas evidence of a desire permanently to weaken Russia.  This view is strongly held and widespread  and it clouds with harassing perplexitythe very real appreciation of the military assistance given to  general denikin.  I speak here of honest men.  whet scope our&apos;inconsistenciesgiive to the agitation of the genuine pro-Germans and the merely dis-honest can be imagined.     Emissaries have recently arrived from bermont&apos;s Western Army andtheir- representations will certainly not be to our advantage.  &apos;     4.  The British Policy in Transcaucasia.   This is a constantsource of dissatisfaction and incidents are continually arising -- ase.g. in connection with the recent formal occupation of Batum - thatfan the flame of discontent.   Suspicion similar to that aroused by our Baltic policy, is created as to our motives, and the troublewill never be removed until there is complete and regular co-                                       1  &apos;                       o
ordination between British activities in Transcaucasia and these in South Russia.     I have thought it necessary to set down those facts,  becausethey cause depression and anxiety in the minds of the loyal,while at the same time they give a constant stimulus to pro-German agitation.                                         R o s t ov-on-the-Pen.                                             21st November, 1919.)
  Political Report for week ending November 22nd, 1919.  )        This has been a particularly important week in the internallife of the country.   In many respects there has been a definitehardening up, a determined effort to overcome the increasing difficultiesof the situation.  To a certain extent the air is cleared, and the mere fact that in the Kuban crisis  General Denikin has strongly andsuccessfully asserted his authority has had a bracing effect, and hashelped to counteract the depression consequent on.the retirement ofthe  troops in the centre and the loss of Kursk.(2)        The Kuban.  In the Kuban the crisis has ended in a completevictory for General Denikin.  At the end of last week general denikin in response to the demand of the Kuban Government that heshould withdraw his order for the arrest of the signatories of theKuban-Hill Tribes Treaty, issued a fresh order proclaiming the Kubanas lying within the zone of the Caucasian Army, (command&amp;si  hyGeneral Wrangel and consisting largely of Kuban Cossacka), andappointing General Pokrovsky commander of the troops in the re&apos;ar.General Pokrovsky was an airman during the war with Germany,was  appointed commander of the troops by the Rada when the Bolshevikswere advancing on the Kuban early in 1918, was promoted General bythe  Rada, an., le.&apos;. a little force an&apos;, also the members of the Rada&apos;out  of Ekaterinodar into the steppes tc join up with Kcrnilov, just before the Bolsheviks capture., the town.  His appointment on the1.present occasion was therefore a challenge to the loyalty of theRada, andiwas well calculated.     The Rada still under the ascendency of the Separatists received.the  news of General Pokrovsky1s appointment with a furious outburst of indignation.-  But the young General took his measures.  He brought up a small force an&quot;, billette.&apos;. them in the Pashkovskaya Stanitza justoutside Ekaterinodar.  The Separatists had sent delegates to the Don
and Terek Cossacks who, they were confident, would support them even to the extent of open revolt against the Volunteer Army.  They alsocounted on the effect of their propaganda among the troops of thegarrison.  On Monday they were still defiant; and Koloboukhov, theone signatory of the treaty who was present in the Rada, actuallymade a long report on the work of the Paris Delegation.  But therewere signs that General Denikin&apos;s determined attitude was producing a change of temper,  Some of the opponents of the Separatists at last found a hearing, and a considerably Impression was made bythe speech cf Di% Dolgopolov, a highly-respected man, who had been one of the original members of the Paris Delegation, and hadresigned on account of the Separatist intrigues of his  colleagues.The timid Ataman,  too, feeling the strong arm of Pokrovsky behindhim, warned the Rada of the danger of continued defiance ofGeneral Denikin.     On Tuesday, November 18th, General Tfrrangel sent from Kislovodsk,where he was  staying,  a strong order for the arrest of  Koloboukhovand other members  of the Rada.   On Tuesday evening the Atamancommunicated  to the Rada a demand from General Pokrovsky for  the surrender of  these members.  At the same time  it was notified thatGeneral Pokrovsky  would hold a review of the garrison  on  the  following morning.  Makarenko, the Separatist President  of  the Rada, urged  theRada to refuse  obedience.  The Ataman asked  to be  allowed to  speak;Makarenko refused  permission, but the majority insisted on hearing the Ataman,   The Ataman implored the Rada  to agree  to  the demand,and not to risk the possibility of bloodshed.  Then Makarenkc said,&quot;The Ataman will not defend us:  we h/ive no Ataman&quot;.   In  the  Houserose a great  uproar, some shouting; &quot;we have an Ataman&quot;,  others&quot;Yve have no Ataman&quot;.   Finally it was decided to debate the question,with the result that a vote of  confidence was  passed  in the Atamanwith only three dissentients,  Makarenko,  astounded at the suddenturn of opinion against him,&quot;at once resigned  the Presidency.
    On the following morning the telegraph and telephone officesere occupied by Pokrovsky1s troops,  the Taman Division that guardedhe Rada was disarmed, and the guard  taken over by Cadets from theifficers&apos;  Training School.  Koloboukhov, P. Makarenko, Omelchenko,  .ianzhula and several other Separatists surrendered and were taken tohe Ataman1s Palace, and thence to prison.  The parade was held,&apos;and therowd in the streets loudly cheered Pokrovsky as he passed.  Theleparatist leader, however,  Ivan Makarenko, succeeded in escaping,lOgether with another particularly aggressive Separatist named Goncharoff    On Wednesday night (November 19) Koloboukhov was tried by fieldiourt martial for high treason, and at five in the morning was hangedlefore the Atamanfs Palace.    The Rada w s c  thoroughly cowe^, tried to engage in routine business.:t sent a deputation to General Denikin to affirm its loyalty toIn i tec! Russia, to announce that it had deprived the Paris Delegationif its mandate and to ask that the offenders should be tried by a[uban court.  Several members of the Government resigned, and the Rada -Inally decided to dissolve and arrange elections - the new Rada toleet not later than December 17.    I am told that there are papers showing Koloboukhov&apos;s relationsiith the Bolsheviks.    (3)  The Don.   The Don and Terek Cossacks were  keenly Interestedin the events in the Kuban, and there was  just a possibility that theyfight in some way or other display sympathy with- the  Kuban Separatists,p at any rate try to drag out the agony  by promoting some feeble csm-IPromise.    A delegation sent by the Rada to the Don  Krug was at first receivedjomewhat coldly.  But in secret sittings  of the Krug  at which these^legates were present and at which  speeches were made by the Donpmagogues, Ageiev and Janovsky, opinion  gradually swung over to  theIm
side of the Rada,,.and on Wednesday evening a resolution waspassed expressing sympathy with the Rada, and urging the necessityof compromise.     On the following morning  (November 7). news was receivedby telephone that General Denikin was coming to the Krug.  Therewas commotion among the members, and the resolution just adoptedwas hurriedly withdrawn and cancelled.     When General Denikin appeared in the hall he wrs greeter withloud applause.  The Commander  in Chief then delivered a speech which has not been reported in the Press, but of which the substance is briefly as follows:-                &quot;Thank you for  your applause, but I have come          to talk to you plainly.  I wish to knew where we          stand, what exactly  you Cossacks went.  I have no          desire to minimise your services, the Cossacks are          fighting well.  But  what is your complaint against          the Volunteer Army?  Remember  the facts.  How did you          talk  with me early in 1918 when thejBolsheviks were          8 versts from Novccherkask?  lr*ho helped you to clear          the Don territory of Bolshevism?  Did the Kuban  Cossacks          take  Ekaterinodar?   No, it was we, the Volunteer Army.          What  do you want now?  Do you  want Bolshevism?   If so,          say so,   I  am willing to go out again into the steppes,          or, if necessary, to evacuate  to England.    The          position  at the front is  difficult,, but not hopeless,          if all pull together.  Kolchak and Yudenich are  out          of  it) all  the weight of Bolshevik effort  is upen our          front now.  And in the rear we have Makhnoism, Kubanism,          Dcnisnu  Ycu are flirting with Georgia and Azerbaijan,          you are speculating, profiteering, you are paving the          way for the Bolsheviks.  This  won&apos;t do.   Things  must          be  changed.  There must be  an  end  to  all  these delays          and equivocations.   The reorganisation of  the  Central          Government  must be completed  at once.  Further,  I  ask          for a certain  limitation  of  the&apos; competence of  the  Krug.          Military  matters, wrr  supplies, and military  communication          must  be  transferred  from  the  Krug  to  be  dealt  with          entirely -by the Ataman.    There has  been  tee much          profiteering  on war  contracts.                &quot;I have  no desire  for  power.  All  I want  is to          carry through  this struggle,  and  \*hen we  have  won          our victory I  shall  gladly hand  over my  authority  to          whomsoever  the  nation may  choose.   But while  I have          power,  that power  -  the  power  of  the  Commander in          Chief,  and  the  representative  of  the  Dictator  -  must          be  acknowledged  and  obeyed.&apos;  Dcn&apos;t play  at politics.&apos;I         Work  for  Russia&quot;.
     The speech made a deep impression on the  members  of  the  Krug,and, as far as can be judged,won them over to General Denikin&apos;aside.  The necessity of hastening the reorganisation of the CentralGovernment was admitted, and a Committee has been formed  to discussthe transfer of military affairs from the  Krug to the  Ataman,according to the Commander in ChiefTs suggestion.     (4)  The Special Council.   At a meeting of the SpecialCouncil on Wednesday with General Denikin in the Chair, N.I. Astrovread a long report describing the serious effects of the  presentadministrative machinery, as illustrated by the Makhrio movement,brigandage, pogroms, and various other excesses and abuses.  he urged the necessity of greater co-ordination between the  central and the local authorities and a greater participation of non-Jofficialbodies in administrative work.  The defects pointed out by Astrovwere fully admitted by other members of the Council, but hissuggested remedies were regarded as vague.  The subject is to bethoroughly discussed at subsequent meetings.  Meantime general denikin by his  strong personal action this week has done much toraise the prestige  of his Government.     In response  to  the bitter complaints  against rising prices,theCommander in Chief  has promulgated, without consulting the SpecialCouncil, a very stringent law against profiteering  or  speculation,threatening  the worst offenders with  the death penalty.  The  law isfull of technical legal defects, and  It  is difficult  to soe  how  itcan be  carried  out.  But  it may make  the most abandoned profiteersmore cautious,  and  at any rate will  give the  population the  assurance that the Government really desires to help them.  Perhaps  the sug-gcstion of one  commentator  is to tho  point -  that in  the present stateof  affairs it would have been better  to  hang  a few  of  the  worst  pro-fitoers as an example to  the rest  than  to  promulgate  a law full  of                                                    disputable/
points.  It is the moral affect that matters for the moment.  Theirunifold economic causes can only be dealt with gradually.     The retirement of V. Lebediev from tho post of Chief of theDepartment of Commerce and Trade is gazetted.  A..Penin who has been invited to succeed him, arrived from Kharkoff on November 21 andhis appointment will probably be announced after he has had upersonal interview with the Commander In Chief.     (5)  The Cadot Conference.   A conference of the Cadet (orConstitutional Democratic) party was held in Kharkoff from November16-19.   About thirty delegates were present from Kharkoff, Rostov,Kiev, Poltava, Voronezh, Vladikavkaz, Odessa and other towns.  the debates on the Jewish question, the Dictatorship and the AgrarianQuestion were animated.   This Liberal Party which wrs in&apos; oppositionunder the old regime now stands strongly for the active support ofGeneral Denikin and the Volunteer Army.  A resolution was passedunanimously asserting the necessity of a national  Dictatorship asthe only means of completing the struggle with Bolshevism and  re-establishing a United Russia which should on the restoration of order express its will through a National Representative Assembly.The resolution on the Jewish question condemned pogroms as  immoraland dangerous to the interests of the Russian State;  at  the sametime leading Jews wore recommended to exert their  influence on their co-religionists to induce them to support tho Volunteer Army.On&apos; tho Agrarian question a resolution wrs passed on  the linos  ofGeneral Denik&apos;in&apos;s programme.  It was resolved to organise immediatelythrough all party committees a collection of warm  clothing  to  be despatched to the troops at the front.     The Conference seems to have aroused great interest  In Kharkoff,and to have encouraged to some extent tho at present rather depressedand panicky inhabitants of that city.                                                Rostov-on-the-Don.                                                   22nd November, 191
