CONFIDENTIAL.                        POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,      (11494)                                      FOREIGN OFFICE,                                                                CHINA /003.gst/^.^                MEMORANDUMG                 on internal  SITUATION IN  CHINA.           INTERNAL SITUATION &quot;IN THE  &quot;SOUTH&quot; AT  THE CLOSE OF 1919.     AT the close of the year 191.9 the internal conflict  in China appears to be in much the same position as at  the -end of 1918.  North and South still confront each other from Kwangtung to Szechwan in a scattered fashion,  and though President Hsu Shih- chang has undoubtedly done his best to bring  them together to negotiate peace and reunion, personal ambitions,  chiefly in the South, have so far managed to nullify  his efforts.  Throughout the year there has been  no fighting to speak of;  the  Armistice has on the whole been well observed ;  and apart from brigandage, which has not abated, the internal conditions have not altered very materially for the worse.  But the continued  maintenance of hordes of soldiery by the military satraps  in the provinces threatens to bleed the country white economically, and is plunging  the finances into more hopeless chaos.                                    The South.     Military Government  of Canton. The so-called  Military Government of Canton continues  to  be the figure-head  of  the  South.   Here,  it will  be  remembered,  the remnants of the Parliament of 1917, which was dissolved at the behest of the monarchist Chang Hstin, sat and claimed to be the legitimate representative body of the Chinese. Republic.  In a manifesto of August 1918 to the Foreign Powers, asking for recognition, the Military Government asserted that their purpose was not to bring about separation or secession but &quot; to  uphold the cause of constitutionalism and the principle of legalism.&quot; They have not elected a  President ; there is a  body of &quot; Administrative Directors&quot; who form the executive, the principal members of which are:               Wu Ting-fang  (Minister for Foreign Affairs).              Tsen Chun-hsuan (Minister of the Interior).              Tang Chi-yao (Chief of the General Staff).             Lu Yung-ting (Minister of War).     Lu Yung-ting is also Inspector-General of the two Kwang Provinces, a title which connotes powers and duties similar to those of a Viceroy in the Manchu regime;  and Tang Chi-yao is the Military Governor of Yunnan.     In the manifesto mentioned above the Canton  Government claimed that, &quot;besides the adhesion&apos; of the  most  powerful portion of the Navy, the Constitutionalists are  in complete control of five  rich  and populous provinces Kwangtung, Kwangsi. Yunnan, Kueichow,  and Yunnan which have declared  their independence, while in  others, such  as Honan, Hupeh, Fukien, Shantung, Honan, Shansi, and  Chekiang,  there are Constitutionalist  armies  in the field, who  are in possession  of large portions  of territory.&quot;     There were originally two factions in this Military Government, the Kwangtung and the Kwangsi.   The Kwangtung faction  was headed  by  Wu Ting-fang,  and comprised  the  leading civil members of the administration; Lu Yung-ting dominated the Kwangsi faction, and he was ably supported by&apos;Mo Yung-hsin, who is the Military Governor  (Tuchtin)  of the Kwangtung  Province.   During  1919  there  was  a split in the ranks of the Kwangsi party, Lu  and Mo having disagreed over the question  of reconciliation with  the  North.   Lu  Yung-ting has  openly  declared  himself for  a settlement with Peking, and has  made no secret of his want of sympathy with the Military Government.  He has even sent emissaries  to the Yangtse  Tuchiins and  to       [1819]          &apos;                                                  *
the  President  at  Peking assuring them  of his support towards the  reunification ofChina.   This spirit he has succeeded in introducing into  other officials  of the KwangsiProvince, with  the result that the atmosphere which pervades the higher administration is almost pro-Northern.     There has been much  dissension in  the South  in  consequence.  Mo Yung-hsin.an able man who is credited with a desire  to  bring  down  the Military Government,is opposed to Lu&apos;s scheme of reconciliation and seems to be working for his own ends.Lu  and his party plotted &quot;with  a former Civil  Governor, Li  Yao-han, and a formerTuchiin, Chen  Ping-kun, for the removal of Mo; but the latter, getting wind of theplot in time, sent  troops to invest Li Yao-han&apos;s stronghold, Shiuhing, and contrived to capture  the whole of Li&apos;s  forces without  a blow  being  struck.  This  success enabledMo to remove  the Civil Governor of Kwangtung, some of whose troops surrendered atShiuhing, and  substitute a nominee  of his own;  but the new appointment was madeirregularly, and of course it is hotly opposed by the Constitutionalists,  and has createddissatisfaction generally at Canton.     As  a central  executive body the Military Government  can  hardly be said to function. Each official attends solely to his own interests, and acts  without respectto the wishes of his superior authority or the good of the people, and, as a rule, quiteunconstitutionally.  It is said that this state of affairs has been accentuated since the departure for Paris of C. C. Wu and Hsu Ch&apos;ien, who exercised what little influence the Military Government possesses.  The  former is Wu Ting-fang&apos;s  son;  and Hsti wasthe  representative of the  old  revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, who has  lately severed hisconnection with the Military Government.     On the whole there  seems little doubt that the Canton  Government is undergoingthe same changes as that of Peking  since the revolution, and that the early zeal forconstitutionalism which ostensibly led to  a  split with the North is  giving way to thedictatorship of military  leaders!   And it is argued from this that a  military ententebetween North and South is a possibility which might  conceivably result in a reunionless  distasteful  to the mass of the population than the existing state of affairs.     Kwangsi. In this province Lu Yung-ting holds unquestioned sway ; he has secured the confidence  of his subordinates, most of whom are suspicious of each other.     It is reported that robbery and brigandage are prevalent.     Yunnan. Here the authorities are said to be awaiting the outcome of the shanghai Conference.  The leading personality is Tang Chi-yao, the military governor,who maintains  that he is anxious  for peace while he is steadily increasing his army. Hehas sent a small body of officers to Japan to undergo a years training in the Japanesearmy.     Apart from the normal brigandage, the  general conditions in Yunnan are said to be fairly peaceful.     Szechwan. Hsiung K&apos;o-wu formally accepted the post of Military Governor,  whichthe Canton Government had long been urging upon him, on the 9th February.  He  isa young man of 33 and unquestionably capable; but he only effectively controls theprovincial capital,  Chengtu,  and the immediate neighbourhood.   The other outstandingfigures  in Szechwan are Ch&apos;^n Hsia-ling, the Frontier Commissioner  at Tachienlu, andLiu  Yu-chiu, who  continues to be Director-General of the Tibetan Bureau.     Across  the north border at  Hanchung,  which is some  30 miles in the ShensiProvince, is Liu Tsun-hou, who is still recognised by Peking  as the de  jure  military governor of Szechwan.  There he still controls a  sufficient number  of troops  to make his presence felt in North Szechwan, should  he care to make a move.     Yunnan troops remain  in  occupation of the  south  of the province, much to theresentment  of  the Szechwanese.   They  are reported to be well behaved and  smartsoldiers, and to be on good terms  with the Kueichow forces at Chungking.  The garrison at the latter place is composed of Szechwanese and Kueichow troops,  who seem to live inharmony and to conduct themselves with exemplary regularity.     Deeember  25,  1919.
