Secretary, Cabinet.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.\?*l.    5th January, 192C.
      1.  The practice followed by Government Departments during the  War  of  issuing documents to,the press marked for publication not  before  a certain date should, as a general rule,  cease.      2.  An exoeption should usually be made in the case of long and detailed official documents cr communiques (which are not  parliamentary papers) particularly those containing a mass Cf figures  which cannot readily be telegraphed.  In these exceptional cases each of the copies supplied to the Press should be clearly  marked that publication must not take place until a certain  date and time*         Usually the document or documents should be inBued  so as to reach the newspaper offices by 10 aem. on the morning preceding the date of publication.       3. In those exceptional cases w&amp;iere long documents of  the olasg referred to in 2, are issued in advance to the press,  they are  to be issued to the tfhole Press without preference,  *sr -*-o - priority being given to any newspaper or group of newspapers.       4. The responsibility for giving documents of the class referred to in 2, to the press rests with the&apos; Government Depart- ment3 oonocrned.       5. Every endeavour must be made by the Government Depart- ments concerned to deliver the dooument or documents early in the  day  and, if possible, advise the newspapers the day before, by post  or  telephone, that the document or documents will be- available the following morning.  *t is necessary to provide the  newspapers with copies as early as possible in the morning since in the case of the provincial press the news has to bo telegraphed to the country.       6. The procedure in regard to the distribution of parlia-Imentary  papers will remain as it stands at present,  such dis- tribution being made by the Stationery office.  It is a breach of- privilege of parliament to give any copies of Parliamentary papers to the.press or to any persons whatsoever before copies[have been /made available to members of both Houses in the case% of command  papers, or to Peers or to M,ps., in the case of House of Lords or House of Commons papers respectively.
