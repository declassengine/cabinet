X            (Repeated to Constantinople and Tehran  under No. 4598/2.)                                (Received 22nd.)    16767.  .17th December.   Following from Malleson dated 12th December  :-    &quot; (1) My chief  Turcoman agent returned  to-day from (? Sarakhs).  He  reportsthat on  20th November there  was important secret meeting between Afghan  Sirdarsin Merv and 10 leading Turcomans.    &quot; (2) Afghans informed Turcomans that some months ago Bolsheviks, in returnfor Afghan  help  against India,  promised  Afghans  all Transcaspia  conjointly withKrasnovodsk up to Oxus.  Now, however, Bolsheviks were making difficulties  andexcuses, and showing no intention to carry out their bargain.    &quot; (3) In consequence Afghans advised Turcomans to refrain from giving assistanceof any sort to Bolsheviks pending farther discussion of whole of future policy betweenAfghans and  representatives  of  all sections of Turcomans.  Afghans  asked  thatsummonses  for such meeting should be sent  out  at once to all other sections  ofTurcomans.    &quot; (4) Afghans  said  if once they obtained  possession of Krasnovodsk, they hadguarantees  of armed assistance of  Turks,  and together they  could defy eitherBolshevik or Volunteer attempts to recapture Transcaspia.    &quot; (5)  Agent says Turcomans have no wish to  come under  either Turkish  orAfghan rule as they have heard  bad accounts  of  both.   They want to be let alone and have no desire  to assist either Bolsheviks or Volunteers.  In  the meantime theywould  view with pleasure  (corrupt  group) between  Bolsheviks and  Afghans. Manythink that we  are encouraging Afghans (? and even)  Bolsheviks (? themselves).    &quot;(6)  Reports from various sources show that Bolsheviks are  enormously jealousof Afghan influence and  interference, though outward relations remain correct.   Allrecent arrivals from  Askabad state Bolsheviks are apprehensive of some  Afghantreachery while they have nearly all available forces  engaged towards Krasnovodsk.&quot;
