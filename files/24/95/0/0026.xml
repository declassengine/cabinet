(This dooument is the property of His Britannic                Majesty1s Government)..325IIew Unemployment Insurance Bill,RETNote by the  Minister of labour.I now attach for the information of my colleaguesa draft of the new Unemployment Insurance Bill, and alsoa memorandum, ex-plaining the provisions of the Bill,which amends in certain respects the memorandum (O.P. 315)circulated by me on December 18 th.     The main effect of the alterations since madeis to reduce the charges falling on the Treasury.     The Chanoellor of the Exchequer agrees with themain principles of the measure as now amended, and any points of detail which arise will be settled in consulta-tion with the Treasury,R.S.Horne.20th December,  1919.
              MEMORANDUM.&apos;        UE:I1?I/0^!KM? INSURANCE BILL.li   Unemployment Insurance is at pre a errt.x-onfined-.toabout 3f million workpeople covered by the national insurance (Unemployment) Acts-, 1:911 to 1918*   The bill now in preparation proposes to extend It so  os to coversubstantially the same field as the Health Insurancescheme with the exception of agriculture and domestic service.   Certain further exceptions are also proposedin Ireland,   The Bill will apply the principle of compulsion to all occupations  (with the exceptionsspecified), but will contain provisions enabling  ,Industries, which,are able and willing to do so, to setup special schemes for dealing with their ownunemployment.Si.   It will be convenient to&apos;-describe ilrat thegeneral scheme, and then the arrangements under whichindustries may set up special schemes.General Schemee3.   Whilst the field covered by the Bill will be practically co-terminous with  that  of the HealthInsurance soheme  the details of the general schemeof unemployment Insurance will be substantially thesame as those laid down in the existing UnemploymentInsurance Acts.4&apos;v   Contributions from employers and employed willbe compulsory and to  them will be added a Btatecontribution  of one-fourth of  the whole.   Provisionallythe rates of  contribution from employers and employedare as follows
              Employers     Employed-      Total.   Men.           3d,         3d..             6d..   Women.         2-Jdi        2 d*.            5d,5.   The weekly rates of benefit proposed are 15s,  formen and 12ft. for women.6.   Certain lower Kites of contributions and benefitare proposed for boys and  girls between  the  ages of16 and 18*-7,   The payment of benefit under the  general scheme,will, in the normal course, be ncde  through  theEmployment Exchanges, but  in  order to  enable TradeUnions to take part in  the administration of benefit in cases where there  is no special scheme for an industry,&apos;It Is proposed to apply the  existing  provisionunder which a Trade Union  may pay out  the State Benefitto its members and  subsequently  recover  It from theMinistry of Labour.   Trade Unions making thisarrangement have not, in the  past, received  any grant towards administrative  expenses, but,,have received certainrepayments under Section.106  of  the.,National Insurance  Set,1911, which they regard as a  grant In  aid of administrative expenses,    As will  be,seen  below it  is proposed  to abolish these, repayments under Section 106,  and it thereforebecomes necessary  to  make  a grant, for  administrative expenses  to the Trade;,Unions  making  these  arranges nts.   Theamount proposed for this gr-nt  is  5$ of  the  amount paid outby the Trade Union by ray  of  State Benefit/  and it&apos;issuggested that  this grant  should be  part of  the generaladministrative expenses under the Act,                                           ... /8i.\ There

There arc certain provisions in the existing scheme ofUnemployment insurance which it is not proposed to continueunder the now scheme because thoy have not boon found.to bo- of practical utility.  Mention need only be made of the provisions for certain small refunds to employers who have kept workmen intfcf;ir employment during tho insurance year, certain correspondingrefunds.to workmen at the ago of 60 if they have roooivod little or no unemployment boncfitj and certain;special provisions for exemptingemployers frun (ho&apos;payment of oontributiono when &apos;their workpeoplearc on short.*timo,9.    Jt is propocod to discontinue the repayments under section106 of the National Insurance Act,&apos;.19Il, under which a eudsidy outof public funds may be paid to Trade Unions paying unemploymentbenefit; the subsidy being not more than one-sixth of the amount sopaid..   Ihc genera!&apos;! object of. this euiisidy was to give to - tho unlnsur-etradoo some degree of State assistance in respect of unemploymentbenefit corresponding to that which the Unemployment Insurance Actsgave to tho insured trades.  Havinr regard to the general scope ofthe now scheme the ground for this subsidy obviously disappears.10.   As the amount  of unemployment benefit that may bo drawn isproportionate f  the number of contributions paid by tho individualconcerned, tho workpeople brougI.it in under the new scheme will hot&apos; boable to draw any substantial&quot;amount of benefit for a considerable timeunless some special measures arc -oaken to credit them with an initialnumber of contributions free,  the need for some special measure ofthis kind will bo the greater because, for reasons which will be&apos;explained &quot;below there will have to be an interval between the passing                                                                there^of the Act, end the date when it comes into force, and it is  likely that the Act will come into force sometime during the winter of 1920-21.  It le proposed therefore, that provision should, be made for enabling the new entrants  after they have paid four contributions to become entitled to a minimum of eight weeks1 benefit during thefirst six months of tho operation of the Act.

It ia hardly possible to take any other course and the proposal is fully justified  n the ground that the   general level of unemployment among the old trades is considerably higher that      among the newtrades and as all workpeople under the general scheme will receive the same benefits In return for the same contributions thetransfer the accumulated fund is reasonable as a set off for theadvantage thus gained by the old trades.  12,  It is proposed to insert in the Bill a provision enablinga proportion of. the railway fares to be paid out of the unemploymentfund in cases where a workman on benefit, is found a  job at a distance.This provision ia not contained in a the existing Acts but there, arenow in operation temporary arrangements which wore begun during triewar, for payment of half fares out of  public funds  and the proposals is in accordance with what is not infrequently done by the TradeUni ona in s iml 1 ar c ire urns t a no e s ,2 3 cial scheme 3 f or - Industrie s,  13,  where  it appears to the minister of  Labour that unemployment  iany particular industry can be more  properly met by the means  of a  .special scheme for that industry  than  under the  general  scheme  aspecial scheme for the purpose may be  approved by the minister  andrun into force   by means  of a special order as  if  enacted  in  the Actnormally trie  initiative would he  taken by a  joint  industrialcouncil, or by  some  other  joint Association of Employers  and employedwhich covers  a  substantial majority  of the  employers  and workpeople in the  Industry,   It may be  expected that such  industries  as Cotton, woollen  and mining&apos;would  formulate  scheme.   This course would  in fact be taken In  well  organised  industries which have  a Relatively  low rate  of  unemployment,  or which are  subject tc  a special form  of  unemployment (c ,g,  short  time)  for  wluchappropriate  provision  is  net made by the  general scheme t   14.   Power  would also he  taken however  enabling the &quot;Minister of Labour  to  set up  a special schoire if he thinks  fit  even where                                                        the/
the initiative is not taken by the industry.   It may be necessaryfor Instance td exercise this power In the case of such classes astransport workers and seamen. -(In the case if Seamen special provision will-also be made under the general scheme on the linesof that already made under the Health Insurance Scheme for use inthe event of a special scheme not being adopted),15.   As regards the financing of special schemes the contributions from employers and employed will not necessarily be those made underthe general scheme but will be such as are laid down in the specie 1;scheme and approved by the Minister as being sufficiently and appropriate in&apos; the circumstances,   The precise method of collectionwill also be determined by the special scheme.16*   It Is not proposed that any State contribution should be paidto&apos; the general fund in respect of persons.&apos; under a special scheme^but a grant&apos;is to be paid out of public.funds towards theadministrative expenses of the special scheme.   This grant Isnot to exceed one-tenth of the estimated amount of thecontributions which would have been paid by the employers andemployed under the general scheme if there had not been such ascheme (l.e. calculated according t* the normal r te of contribution und^r the general scheme).   This is rather less thanone-third of the amount which will be&quot;paid as a State contribution by the Exchequer if all the workpeople concerned were under thegeneral scheme.   It may eventually be necesbary to give a largergrant In seme&apos;cases Ji,e, that of port transport workers) butit is not&apos; proposed to offer this in the present B^ll*  Appropriateprovi-?Ion with regard to Inspection and audit will be made,17.   As regards transfers of individuals between the generalscheme and the special scheme/
Hischeme, or vice Versa,.,...or botwoon one special scheme andanother,, a system of transfer values as under HealthInsurance is inappropriate for Unemployment .Insurance, and Isnot. proposed,,&apos;   The general, principle will be that if. an individual transfers from a general scheme to. a special scheme the. general scheme will for six months continue tc. ,be.responsible for providing him with unemployment benefit.Similarly in the reverse process, the. special scheme would beresponsible for providing unemployment benefit for six monthsafter the date on which the individual left it in order toontor tho general scheme.   Corresponding arrangements wouldbo made as regards transfers between one special scheme andanother, .  The institution of special schemes will obviouslytake a considerable time.   It is hoped to do a good deal ofpreparatory work before the aAct is passed, but even so,, theremust bo a substantial interval between the date of passing ofthe Act and the date on which it comes into,force in order toallow time for special schemes to bo set up.,   Provisionally Itis thought that this interval will havo to be at least sixmonths&apos;, although it may later on bo found possible to reduce thisperiod somewhat if   ..sufficient progress has been made beforetho passing of tho Act,...     18..   In tho original proposal there was a provision for allowing special schemes to bo set up not only, for an industry as a whole but for separate associations  (eg.,, trade unions).On consideration it - is thought bettor not. to  include thisproposal, in the Sill because  it  causes great  complication andie.: undesirable on other grounds,v particularly as  it  opens the door to the entry of. Industrial  insurance societies  into  thofield  of unemployment Insurance  which would &quot;  certainly be                                               /strongly
strongly resented by Trade Unions.

IRELAND.

19. The proposal as regards Ireland is that the Bill should apply only to the trades which are already insured against unemployment under the existing acts, but that the Minister of Labour should be empowered to extend the new scheme to other trades by administrative order.



Administrative Expenses.

20. The proposal with regard to the administrative expenses under the new scheme are based on those relating to the existing scheme of unemployment insurance. Those expenses are borne in the first instance by the Treasury which receives out of the unemployment fund an appropriation in aid not exceeding one-tenth of the total receipts of the fund.



Annual Cost to the Exchequer.

21. The Cost to the Exchequer falls under three heads, viz:-

(i) the state contribution under the general scheme;

(ii) the grant towards administrative expenses of special schemes;

(iii) the cost of administration of the general scheme should this exceed the appropriation in aid which is one-? of the annual income of the unemployment fund.

No charge is in fact expected to arise under head *(c)

As regards (a) and (b) the cost will depend on the number of workpeople who are covered by special schemes and the following three estimates have been made by the Government Actuary on the assumptions respectively that the number so covered is (a) none (b) 2,000,000 and (c) 3,850,000; it is unlikely that either (a) or (b) will be realised:-
