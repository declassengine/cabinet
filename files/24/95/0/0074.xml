LIUIJITIOFS.          55ie present position at  V/oolwich Arsenal oalls for serious consideration.          The Ministry assumed responsibility for the controlof the Factories as from August 23rd  1915.   The War Office and admiralty however, remained in possession  of stores in  the Arsenal,while the Inspection and Research  Departments although transferredto the Ministry in the Autumn of 1915,  continued to be  administered-independently of the Factories.  In other words, the transferinvolved practically only a transfer  of Ministerial responsibilityfor a part of the Arsenal.best methods of improving the  administration  of Woolwich, mainly witha view to increasing its immediate  efficiency for the purposes of theWar, but it  was considered that,  in view  of  the complexity of theproblems involved and the number  of separate  interests concerned -both Government and local - it was  desirable  that the Minister shouldbe advised by an independent Committee.  She  creation during the war of large national factories equipped with  modern plant for themanufacture of Munitions of all kinds  rendered an enquiry particu-larly desirable.  With this object  in  view Mre Churchill appointed a Committee in July 1913, under the chairmanship,of Mr. Mc in non--Woodand including representatives  of  the War Offics and Admiralty, withthe following terms of reference:-     &quot;To enquire into and report upon,  the control,administration, organisation,  lay-out and  equipment  ofthe Royal Ordnance Factories at  Woolwich,  and  the  nature and distribution of the work carried on in them  at theArsenal generally, and to advise the Minister  of Munitionswhat, if any, changes are required.In the early part of  1918  attention was directed to the
TJv&apos; lx Jl     &quot;The Committee to have d;ie regard to the importanceof efficient and economic production, and the necessityfor maintaining a reserve of productive power, and togive duo weight to the obligations of the Government,as an iSmplpyer, to ensure the &quot;best possible industrial and housing conditions for the Employees&quot;23           his Committee, which reported at the end of Hovember1918, while expressing views in favour of the retention of theArsenal, strongly condemned its existing administration as well as its lay-out and equipment.          The arguments advanced by ihe Committee for the retentionof Woolwich Arsenal need not be recapitulated, since .the cabinet approved their recommendations on M&amp;y 6th 1919.t          The Committee further advised:.-.          (a)  That Woolwich Arsenal should be organised mainly               as a peace establishment for the supply of armaments               in peace-time, and ol: experimental types and improved               design in war and peace;  and that its reserve of               expansion, so far as its peace lay-out is concerned               be limited to increased production in the case of               small wars,          (b)  That one Minister only should be solely responsible               for control of the Arsenal.          The Cabinet in approving these proposals decided that theMinister of Supply should be the Minister solely responsible for thecontrol of the Arsenal.          &apos;Bie Committee laid special emphasis in their reports on:-           (1)  Vifoolwich ceasing to be used for the storage of                Munitions of war and other completed stores, especially               explosives, such stores being removed elsewhere.           ( )  The Arsenal being organised on commercial lines.  .           (3)  An expert Committee being appointed to submit proposals                for the re-organisation of the lay-out of the Arsenal.          The desirability of adopting the recommendations of theLicKinncn-Wood Committee has not been questioned, but action in thedirection of giving effect to them has been seriously prejudiced[by the uncertainty as to the future of the lvlinistry*          With a view to assisting the Minister in giving effect  tothe recommendations of the Mcliinnon-Wood Committee and to advisegenerally on questions affecting the administration of the Factories,an Advisory Committee was appointed last July,.-consisting of thefollowing:-
                Sir Benjamin Johnson (Chairman)                Rt. Hon. Wm. Adamson, 11,2.                Sir Charles Ellis,       ,  0CeBo                Sir Alexander Gracie, JC.B.JJ!.. M.V.O.                Sir W. Graham Greene, K.C.B.                Sir George Ha&amp;cock, KOB.JJ!.          The discussions of this Advisory Committee have centredround the following questions     (1)  Appointment of Managing Director far the Arsenals     (2)  Remodelling of lay-out.     (3)  Alternative work of a civil character for the          Ordnance Factories,     (4)  Removal of stores from the Arsenal.          In none of these questions has it &quot;been   -possible forany real progress to be made, as will be seen from the followingexamination of each:-     (l)  It is generally admitted that until  the administration          of Woolwich (which the Llinistry inherited) is radically          overhauled there is no hope of securing an improvement          of present conditions in the Arsenal,  The central          administration at Woolwich is weak.  There are several          authorities at Woolwich independent  of C.S.O.F., and the          Director General of Factories in the Ministry, viz.,                      Army Ordnance Department                      Naval Ordnance Department                      Inspection Department                      Ordnance Committee                      Research Department.          ;i]ven the Ordnance Factories themselves are arranged          departmentally in such a way that  shops attached to one          group of factories are doing similar work to that&apos;done          in shops belonging to another group, e.g. there are          *.^^^4^^^^K^^^^^3Uil)illiii(j L , five separate          foundries, three blacksmiths,shops,  four printing          establishments, etc.  The solution proposed is the
..........&quot;-rr-rT-&quot;  &apos;    &quot;  ., ,    -  .uwmmmmappointment of a Managing Director responsible  for  theAdministration of the whole Arsenal,   The Ministry has had very&apos;great difficulty in finding,, on terms of remunerationacceptable to the Treasury, anyone with the requisite qualifica--tions for this posto  Recently a nomination has been made butthe Ministry has not yet been able to secure the concurrence of either the War Office or the Admiralty.  Until the future status and functions of the Ministry, so far as Woolwich isconcerned, are determined and accepted by all concerned, it isalmost impossible to proceed further with an appointment whichis fundamental to the much needed re-organisation.          As illustrating the difficulties of the presentposition it may be stated that the establishment of the WhitleyIndustrial Joint Council in Woolwich has been impeded, owing tothe lack of an efficient system of management,  while it isunderstood that part of the Woolwich staff under the War office is being included in a separate scheme, whioh must result inconfusion.          Plans for the remodelling of the lay-out cannot becompleted, in the absence of clear directions in princeple as to the lines to be adopted.  Modern and efficient machinesare being secured in small quantities but it is  almost impossibleto devise any satisfactory scheme which can be  carried out, .where much remains outside the Ministry&apos;s control, wherecongestion arises from the dumping of stores, where theestablishment to be maintained is uncertain, and where thenature of work to be. -undertaken in future is also in doubt.          An essential feature of the re-organisation of woolwich is the provision of civil-work, framed to employan establishment of work people equal to that maintained priorto the War and for this the most efficient system of factoryadministration is required.  A certain amount of alternative work has already been arranged, but such orders as have beenreceived have only partially solved the problem.  The Ministry
 has not yet full authority to proceed on the lines indicated  in the attached Memorandum,  On the one hand, pressure is exerted  in the direction of suspending further discharges of labour;  on the other hand are the strong views  expressed against  the Government Factories undertaking work of a  commercial character, and this is bound to be a factor to be  tali en into consideration in the placing of further orders of a commercial character with Woolwich,  The question is also bound  up with a re-modollihg of the lay-out and the removal of bulk storage, both of Which are essential if efficient production is to be  Secured.  The probability under present conditions is not so much that Woolwich will compete with the Trade, but that its  costs will so far exceed those of the Trade, even after allowing  for  profit, that the whole scheme of civil work will  have to be abandoned,)            As regards the removal of Stores from Woolwich, repeated representations have been made to the War Office and Admiralty  but with very  little result.  It is stated that the congestion at Woolwich to-day is worse than it has ever been,, Fresh  consignments on behalf of the War Office and Admiralty are being  sent into  all  parts of the Arsenal almost daily, frustrating any attempt  at remodelling and increasing the congestion.   In particular,  it  is understood that, in spite of the views  of  the Liciiinnon Wood Committee, the Hathan Committee and of other  experts, filled ammunition and explosives material are not being fully cleared  out  of Woolwich: consignments  are still being received and the risk ,of an explosion  remains.            The problems affecting Woolwich are admittedly complex,,, but  the failure hitherto has been mainly that  they have never been  energetically  tackled from the  executive
point of view, under the control of a single authority.Of the Ministry1 s administration no part is likely to -givomore trouble than Woolwich, or be more open to public criticism,&apos; and the longer action is delayed, thegreater eventually will be the difficulty of effectingimprovements^                                   IHVEKFORffl.30.12.19.
            APPENDIX.ALTERNATIVE WORK FOR ROYAL ARSENAL WOOLWICH.(Copy of Memorandum handed to the Prime Minister before  his   visit to Woolwich,  IIovember,  1919).          It is necessary that early consideration should begiven to the questions both of reducing still further thenumbers employed at Woolwich and of providing alternative workon a considerable soale in order to maintain efficiently an establishment capable of immediate adaptation for futureemergencies.NUMBERS miLOm) AT Sir] ORDMC^ ?iiGTORIES, WOOLWICH.      Beginning of the War     ----           10,750  .      Date of the Armistice               --      65,744      October 18th, 1919      -    - ,   -      19,729CURRENT PRODUCTION WORK.          The current production at Woolwich falls into two classes:     (A)          (i)  Completion of orders for  War Material and                 repair of liunitions,         (ii)  Experimental work required for Ordnance,        (iii)  Breaking dov/n.     (B)  Post-Armistice orders for work of a Civil character.          (a)  Work on War Material.               The work connected with (a) is estimated to                 last on an average 5 to 7 months and to                 keep employed during that time an average                 of 8,000 work people,          (b)  Work of Civil Character,                 Orders have already been obtained for:-                     100 Locomotives,                   2,000 11,2.R, Wagons.          .                     500 G.W.R.

                Sundry small demands for Trinity House,                In addition to this new work,  repair work of           the following is on hand:-                         Bailway Wagons,                         Motor Vehicles,                It is estimated that the above work of Civil           character Cannot afford employment  for more than         &apos;  4/5,000 work people for a period of 10/12 months.          Unless, therefore,, further work is obtained  for\7oolwich there is no alternative but to reduce the establishmentto a figure actually below the pre-war establishment,  having  regardto the.present accumulation of ,t?ar Material, and to the decision totransfer High Explosives work elsewhere,ALgjggAglVg WOHK FOR WOOLWICH,          Consideration has been given to the possibility ofobtaining Additional work for &apos;,7oolwi6h*          It has been assumed that it is the intention of theGovernment b;adhere to their decision that only articles intendedto be consumed in the Public Service shall be produced in national factories and that there shall be no question of competing in themarket with commercial firms for commercial orders.  On the otherhand, it is essential, if Woolwich is to be kept in a state of pre-paredness for future emergencies by the maintenance of a sufficiently large and  efficient nucleus- of skilled  staff, that  some  sort of alternative work for Governmeiit requirements  other  than Armamentshould be produced to the  extent that this may prove to be compatible with war reserve  capacity,           The Cabinet have  approved the adoption of the followingpolicy in reference to Woolwich:-       (i)  That the arguments  in favour of  the retention     *              of a Government Arsenal for Munition             manufacture  in peace  time  are  overwhelming^  /              and  that the  location of that  Government             Arsenal  should be at  Woolwich,
       (ii)  That Woolwich Arsenal should be organised mainly              as a peace establishment for the  supply of              Armaments in peace-time, and of experimental              types and improved design in war  and  peace; and              that its reserve of expansion, so far as  its              peace lay-out is concerned, be limited to              increased production in the case  of  small wars,      (iii)  Thac one Minister only should be solely responsible              for control of the Arsenal,          The result of enquiries which have been  made  asto the nature of alternative work for Government purposes whichmight be economically produced at Woolwich indicates that theprospect of obtaining such work on any appreciable scale  is mainly in the direction of:-      (1)  Railway Material (Locomotives, wagons and              passenger rolling stock),      (2)  Telephone and Telegraph Apparatus  (The Post              Office contemplate an expenditure of               3,000,000 on tele phone s alone),           The Ministry desires authority in principle  toproceed  on the following lines, subject to approval in detailof any proposals involving expenditure on a considerable scale:-      (1)  That, in order to maintain an adequate and efficient              cadre  at the Royal  Ordnance Factories and to              reduce the dead-weight expenditure on their              maintenance under normal conditions,  all suitable              orders for Government Service  requirements should              in  the first  instance be scrutinised with a view              to  determining what  could be  economically manu-              factured at permanent Government  Factories,      (2)  That  detailed  investigations  be  made as to the  extent              to  which the Ministry of Transport and the Post              Office can place  orders  on  Woolwich on a considerable              scale  for railway material  and telephone and   &apos;
            telegraph apparatus, the oost of meeting such orders            and the number of workpeople whioh such orders            would keep employed.    (5)   That concurrently with the above, the Ministry should            bo authorised to formulate proposals for remodelling            certain portions of the Arsenal in order to            secure efficient production.          It will be tho aim to secure work for V/oolwichsufficient to employ continuously a cadre approximately equalto the pre-war establishment,.          It is understood that the Dockyard employees are pressing for Construction of mercantile tonnage as alternative work for the Dockyards,.  Should this principle bo approved,the question of the construction of the Propelling and AuxiliaryMachinery for such tonnage might be considered as alternative workfor Woolwich^          If the erection of special plant for constructionof such Propelling and Auxiliary Machinery for merchant ships is considered, the possibility of making such plant capableof undertaking similar work for war ships should also beconsidered.November, 1919.
