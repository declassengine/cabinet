Tho situation at Narva is very critical.  The Bolshe-boisheviks are effecting a large concentration against the Esthoniansand the latter have asked for immediate Allied assistance in munitions to withstand this imminent offensive, otherwise theywill be forced to accede to the Bolshevik peace terms, the secretclauses of which aro inimical to British interests, as they includethe withdrawal from Esthonian territorial waters of all foreignmen-of-war and tho opening up of Reval as a free port to SovietRussia.

The S.S. &quot;Krasnovodsk&quot; has also not returned to Baku  andis much over due.            It is reported that Denikin has proclaimed a blockade.on the Caspian and all  regular  sailings between Baku  and Enzelihave been  stopped^   He M.

There is no fresh news from Trinidad *                        GERMANY.          .  The German reply to the Allied Note on ratification of peace was received in Paris on 15th December.            Germany is willing to make reparation for the Scapaincident but not in the precise form proposed in the Protocol?German Delegates at Paris will immediately offer explanation whyAllied demands cannot be fulfilled without the capacity of Germanyto meet her general obligations under the Treaty being uffectedo            The Delegates will submit alternative proposals whichthey hope will lead to a prompt settlement.  They ask that inview of their  readiness to make reparation officers and men ofships interned at Scapa may be immediately releasedo            On general subjects General Malcolm writes   &quot;It is curiously typical of the mental attitude of the German    people at  the present time that absolutely no public interest    is shown in the recent negotiations and notes which might,    there is reason to suppose, have resulted in the final exchange    of ratifications and peace.   Americans refusal to accept    the treaty, Hcrr von Simson*s return from Paris, the demands    by the Entente for the surrender of docks, have excited a    certain resentment against Prance and England] but the feel-    Ing of the mass of the people is one of sullen apathy, without    any sign of open hostility.   One class of the population    feels strongly on the subject of the surrender of the docks,    another rather larger class feels more strongly on the surrender    of the officers, and is extremely sore about the failure of    the Baltic enterprise; but the only subject which is felt    universally, and can stimulate tho people to anything like    public demonstration, is the question of the return of the    prisoners  from Prance.   This alone unites all classes and  grouses them out of the apathy into fchich they have sunk*&quot;Surrender, of Gorman Merchant Vessels:.            An additional Tanker has been surrendered during theweek ended 20th December, making the total number of german merchant Vessels surrendered 358*                        NETHERLANDS,  i          ... The Naval Estimates presented by the Minister ofHarino were thrown, out by the 2nd Chamber on December 12th.            The Ministerial statement of the Government&apos;a policy with regard to the Navy as publishod in the N.Ro Courant (28.*m)shows a reduction In the estimates of nearly six million florins,in keeping with the general desire of the Cabinet to restrictexpenditure.   The object of the Minister of Marine has been theformation of a small compact nucleus that may be developed ac-cording as the exigencies of tho situation requi^-a.            Increased amounts are to be allotted for submarines                                                / and s

Generallyspeaking, the country would have to rely on submarines, minefields and aircraft for its defence, and as an inducement to  mento remain in the naval service a new scale of wages,  bonusses and pensions will bo introduced in Januaryi                        ITALY.                        iMnlili t in i il            The new rates of pay for naval officers  have Just been published.  The percentages increases:, compared with the oldinitial rates, arc as follows :-Midshipmen.               100$Sub.Licut.                 85$Lieut.                     40$Lieut. Commr.              44$Commander.                 40$Captain.                   20$Commodore.                 12$Rear Admiral.              50$Vice Admiral.              29$Admiral.                   20$            The new scale is better  graded than the old one, andallows for more progressive increases of pay in the differentranks.            According to the Press the new Italian Naval programmowill show that great attention is         to be paid to lightcraft for coast defence; submarines, tropodo-craft, motor launches,minelayers, arc to be built in numbers, and there is to bo a greatdevelopment In hydroplanes.   Fast light cruisers will also be           constructed) but tho largo ship is apparently to beneglected.Flume.            Reports from Flume state that the Italian Fleet is pre-pared against possiblo events on the East coast in the neighbour-hood of Bari, and that failing a satisfactory solution of theFiume question, it is possiblo that D^nnunzio may attempt an attaclupon Northern Italy.            Tho Government has now announced definitely that theofficers of the Army and Navy under the orders of D&apos;Annunzio arcnot being paid from the Italian Exchequer.            there is reason to bolicvo that the Italian GovernmentIs maintaining the efficiency of the naval units at the disposalof DfAnnunzio, filling up vacancies in tho warships as they occur?                        ROUMANIA.            A telegram dated 11.12.19 states that final arrangements have been made for the French Naval Forces in Roumanian waters to commence mineswepping at once.
