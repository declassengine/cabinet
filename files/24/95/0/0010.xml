POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT,       (11487)                                    FOREIGN OFFICE.                                                              Spain /0/0.                              MEMORANDUM                                      ON                      LABOUR TROUBLES IN SPAIN.    DURING the past few weeks, and especially during the past few  days, a verymenacing situation has developed in Spain.   Its essence lies in the adoption andpursuit by the employers at Barcelona of methods of industrial conflict on a large scale under the inspiration, as there seems too good reason to fear,  of the ExtremeConservatives, led by Senor la Cierva, with the object of bringing about a situationin which military  intervention  would be  generally deemed  necessary for  therestoration of order.   In the latter part of October the  Federation of employers in Barcelona declared a general lockout.   It is not to be denied that many of them have undergone a large amount of provocation.  There is no doubt that in  severalindustries  the workmen have been  steadily incited by some of their  leaders andinspirers to engage in one strike after another, and to the  adoption of &quot; Terrorist &quot;methods in the conduct of those disputes.    These influences have doubtless been exercised also towards the breaking down of the effective authority of the employers,by forcing into  large numbers  of  factories and  workshops representatives  ofsyndicates who not only use their positions to  secure the observance of trade unionregulations, but generally promote the disorganisation of  the successful conduct ofthe industries concerned.   It is not therefore at all surprising that the employingclass, who have been treated with marked disrespect, and in not a few cases withactual violence, should have felt drawn  towards something  in  the  nature  of organised action such as might break the spirit of the  syndicates and  induce theirmore moderate and sober members to rebel against their Extremist  leaders.    Accordingly,  there was no great reason for astonishment  at the fact that onthe 25th October the Federation of Employers  at Barcelona issued what was recog-nised as practically  a  declaration of war  against the Syndicalist organisations  inthe form of a general lockout.   In  doing so  the employers published a statementacknowledging  the gravity  of the consequences which such a step on their  partmust  involve, but claiming that  their attitude  was  justified by  the  fact  that individual strikes and  boycottings, which had been the cause of the previous greatconflict at  Barcelona, had  continued and perhaps even increased.    Further,  they said that the Federation could find no better or more radical means for putting anend to the deadly  influence exercised  by a small minority among the  working  classesthan that of declaring  the lockout.   Addressing themselves  to the  mass  of  theworkers, the  employers invited them to meditate upon the  disastrous  influence  oftheir anonymous inspirers, and to recognise  that they themselves would be the first to gain by  shaking themselves free from such influences,  being assured  that  theemployers were cordially ready to make all the concessions to labour which  justicecould require.    At first it seemed  that the strong line  taken by the employers  had  provedsuccessful.   After about a fortnight, occupied with negotiations, an  accord was signed on the 12th November.   This accord had in view an understanding with theGovernment of  Senor Sanchez de Toca that legislation would be brought in at thefirst opportunity in the Cortes.  This law was to contain provisions prohibiting any fresh interruption of work, either  partial or total,  without reference being  firstmade to a  Commission of Labour, which had  been established  by Royal decree onthe 11th October.    Practically, as it would seem,  this law would amount to theprohibition of either strikes or lockouts, and to compulsory reference of all disputesto the  arbitration of the Labour Commission.  For a moment light seemed to havedawned upon the profoundly gloomy  industrial situation of Barcelona.   This relief,however, was of  the briefest duration.  Within a  week, or less,  incidents wereoccurring on both sides which boded ill for tranquillity.    Yet, if the employers and the workpeople of the much-troubled city had been permitted to  act by themselves, it seems not impossible  that industrial  peace might
 have been gradually evolved there.   Unfortunately,  both sides were  subject  to inspirations of a provocative kind.   In the case of the workpeople, there can be no doubt, even if positive evidence of the fact has not been afforded, that the inspirers of class hatred and anarchy, both abroad and at home, must have been alarmed  at the prospect of a pacific arrangement which might conceivably be lasting, and must have taken  action which could  hardly  be without effect,  to prevent  the complete fulfilment of the terms on which the lockout had been suspended.   On the other hand, it was widely recognised that&apos; in agreeing to the lockout of the  25th October the Barcelona employers were influenced  by the High Tory and Militarist section of the Conservative Party in the Cortes, led by Sefiors Maura and la Cierva.    The latter appears now to be, as indeed he had been for a long time  past,  the most powerful  and   most  dangerous  personality  on that  side  of Spanish  politics. [Reference was made to this inspiration by the Marquis of Lema in a conversation with Sir A. Hardinge, reported in the late Ambassador^ Confidential despatch No. 382 of the 5th  November. ]     There seems to be little doubt that the same sinister inspiration is very largely responsible for the  very grave fact [announced in Sir E. Howard&apos;s telegram No. 763- of the 2nd December j that a general lockout had  been proclaimed  at  Barcelona affecting printers,  machine shops, carpenters, dyers, bleachers,  finishers,  tinsmiths, and transport wharfingers, and  that the  lockout was to take  effect on the  2nd. December.  The spinners, weavers, and calico printers, it was  added,  had received orders to cease work on  Saturday, the  6th December.   It seems hardly probable that, in  all those industries, the workpeople can have, in the brief interval since the termination of the lockout  of the 25th October, behaved in a fashion justifying or even excusing the wholesale action taken by the Barcelona employers,  even if such conduct had occurred in some of the industries concerned.   The  explanation, as appears most likely,  lies in  the intense political  bitterness  which   has  been exhibited on the part of Senor la Cierva and his supporters.   He himself has been making  desperate efforts to upset the Ministry of Senor Sanchez de Toca,   He went the length of making personal attacks on the character of the Prime Minister, with the result of a most violent and disorderly scene in the Cortes.  A specially vehement and bitter onset being made against the Minister of War, on account of  his action in the restraint of the associations of army officers known as Juntas, that Minister was led to resign, with the  result that the  entire Ministry, by way of showing their solidarity with the Minister specially attacked,  placed their  resignations in  the hands of the King.   The position became so acutely critical, through this evidence of the renewal of the baleful exercise of  military pressure in politics,   that  the Spanish newspapers considered it by no means impossible that an entirely Military Cabinet  might come into power.    Happily  this danger has,  at any  rate for the present,  been avoided.    The King has [according to Sir E.  Howard&apos;s telegram No. 768 of the 3rd  December],  after having consulted  the heads of the various political parties, determined to retain the present  Government in office, it  being agreed that the question of the Juntas should be settled by the Cortes.     That is so much to the good, but if Senor la Cierva and his friends can maintain their pressure on the Barcelona employers, and so secure the continuance of a lockout,there cannot  but be a  grave danger  of disorders, which may  require military intervention.  As is pointed out in a confidential communication received here, there are broadly speaking two large parties among the  Syndicalists,  one in  favour ofaction directed towards anarchy, and the other inspired by relatively more moderateobjects, and the continuance of the lockout is practically certain to operate towards driving the Moderates into the Extremist camp.  The fact of such a transfer would almost inevitably be to incite the Labour Congress, which was to meet in Madrid onthe 10th December, to violent counsels, resulting in the extension to the capital andother leading towns of  industrial warfare, in  connection with which military intervention would be called for.   The outlook seems a very gloomy one.   The policyof the Government  of Senor Sanchez de Toca, even if, as in some cases has beensuggested, it has been too yielding towards the strikers, appears on the whole to haveshown considerable  promise of a judicious  treatment of the  industrial and economic:problems now pressing for solution in Spain, and it would be matter for great regretif what seems to amount to a conspiracy on the part of the Extreme Conservativesfor the creation of disturbances demanding forcible suppression, should be crownedby success.December 5, 1919.
    P.S.  Later information shows that, after all, the Ministry of Senor Sanchezde Toca has not been able to maintain itself.   What appears to be a compromiseMinistry has been formed, under Senor Allende Salazar, a politician who can be littlemore than a figure-head, consisting of Conservatives and Liberals.  It is encouragingto hear that the leaders in the Cortes  are said to be practically unanimous against allowing the Government to be dictated to by Juntas.   But until the Barcelonaemployers have withdrawn their wholesale lockout the dangers referred to in the above memorandum will remain.    December  15, 1919.
