With reference to the proposals before the Cabinet   in regard to the increase of benefits in Health Insurance   and Unemployment Insurance, the following comments occur   to me.   1.    I think there will be considerable opposition to the   proposed increase in contribution by the employers and the   workers.    The proposals, with benefits at 15/- for men   and izjjo for women entail a weekly contribution of l/5 for   men and l/3 for women, to bo shared between the employer and   the worker.                                                                   1        In view of the large increase over eristing contribu-      ,    tions, it seems to me that there .iwi 11 be but little more   opposition if the contributions were increased to l/6 and   l/4.    Su &apos;&amp; an increase might be used to diminish the cost    to the State by probably four and a half million pounds if   the present extra block grants by the State (the amount of   which I do not know) - in addition to the original statutory   2/9th and l/4th respectively of the benefits paid by the   State - amount to so much.   2.    I observe that it is proposed to raid the sinking fund   in order to raise  500,000 a year.  I consider this objectionable,   and think it may jeopardise the officacy of the plan for   redemption of the reserve values.   3.   If I understand tho proposal correctly, it is intended   to exclude sanatorium benefit from the Insurance Act which   I think is quite proper, but apparently it is intended also                    3 d   to hand over the l/3 per person to local authorities.
9I suggest this should toe retained in the Insurance  accounts and used in part payment of the additional money requiredfor medical benefit and thus avoid the necessity for the raid on the sinking fund.4,        The proposed increase in sickness benefit would  throwa charge on the Ministry of Pensions unless steps are taken to prevent it.  Under an existing agreement,  explr-ing in 1920j approximately  250,000 a year is paid  outof the Ministry of Pensions Vote, as a compensation  to the societies for the increased risk borne by the Societiesarising from the impairsd health of the men disabled in thewar.  Ihis is merely another State contribution to  the societies.  If the sickness benefit is increased by 50$the claim on the Pensions Ministry might be equallyincreased.  In any new arrangement with the Societies,this claim should now be waived entirely and the wholeState contribution should be drawn from the one source.5.        The increase proposed for the fees of medical practitioners may also affect the Pensions Vote, Atpresent about  jL2Q,000 a year is paid out of the PensionsVote to medical  practitioners as a compensation for theadditional service that they may be expected to have torender in respect of men disabled in the war.  Again,the whole payment to the medical practitioners in respectof Insurance matters should come out of the Insurance vote and in view of the increase, it is proposed to pay them inthe flat rate, this service should be considered coveredand the Pensions Vote accordingly relieved of the payment.          On the other hand the panel doctors should be&apos;putunder obligation to give information to the pensions ministry or its medical officials concerning the otateof health of disabled men amongst, their insured patients,
 so  that  this information may be available &quot;for&quot;the Medical  Boards  and medioal^ref&quot;erence s without extra payment.   This provision is of real importance both in  the interests of  the nan and the tax payer, 6.   Another question arises on Unemployment Insurance, viz.- whether the-re  should be  included the partly disabled man, and more especially those drawing alternative pension, which  is based upon earning capacity.   Many nice considerations  arise which I confess I have not had time to probe.   A partly disabled man, capable of doing light work only is obviously, a worse insurable proposition.   His employment  is likely to be intermittent and he would be amongst the class likely to be charged the full premium for one day&apos;s work.   It may be thathe should be exempt from insurance,  and if this caused some preference&apos; in employment owing to the employer not having to pay the contribution, it could be justified, on the ground that it was especially desirable to employ the disabled.
