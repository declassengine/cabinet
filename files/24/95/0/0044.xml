Itseems unlikely that the dockers will reaoh an amicable settlement with their employers, and the general opinion in Lancashire isthat if the miners fail to obtain nationalisation by peaoefulmeans, end call a strike, the dockers will oomejaut with them.In Glasgow, there is talk of an important general strike inFebruary,     The Trade Union Congress is considered by many labour mento have been a fiasco.  .tobert Williams considers that it left the movement, if anything, weaker than before.  He adds that the rank and file are becoming increasingly revolutionary and that&quot;the leaders will have to lead or get out.&quot;     Some details are given of the organisation of the CitizenGuard in Switzerland, in connection with the project of forming a similar boty in this county,  Shis projeot has now been mergedin a soheme for a permanent Special Constabulary,     The unrest among discharged soldiers seems to be increasingowing to the laok of employment, and there is talk among them of taking some kind of disorderly aotion unless the Government findswork for them.There/
     There is evidence of Increasing cohesion between the IriejSinn Feiners in England and tho mare advanoed British labour  1element.  Local Sinn Feiners are said to have raised a sum ofmore than  12,000 in Liverpool for the Irish National Loan.     On the whole, the outlook for the New Year is less menaoilthan it was twelve months ago,  Shore are proapeots of imports!strikes within the next f w;i months, but the factors ohange solquiokly in labour disputes that.even these may evaporate.Though the rank and file of Labour seem steadily to be inoliniltowards the Left, the extreme revolutionaries seem to be losinltheir former influence.
1UNATIONALISATION OF THE MINES.          The selfishness of the miner, who considers himself     the Alpha and Omega of the Labour movement,  is admirably     demonstrated in the manifesto of the &quot;Mines  for the Nation     Committee&quot; mentioned  in my last report.   The authors     write &quot;In every workshop, faotory, offioe or other place     where trade union members are employed the.subject of     disoussion should be coal.   The Labour platform should     be devoted to talks about ooal.&quot;          Prank Hodges and J r. James Wignall,  M.P, (Forest of    , Dean) opened the oampaign in West Wales;  the former stated     that &quot;Britain was slipping down the hill towards eoonomio     and social chaos&quot;, and claimed that nationalisation was     the only effective brake, as industry had got beyond     capitalist management.  Mr. Hartshorn, M.P., and Mr, 0.a. ...     Spencer, M.P., have also been speaking in Wales during the     week.          On Deoember 20th Robert Smillie addressed a large     meeting of Durham miners and referred to the alleged     exploitation of Indian miners.          Some miners in Lancashire are beginning to doubt     whether they will obtain any real benefit from     nationalisation.   They do not care for Government control     and my correspondent reports that in the pits at Leigh,     Atherton, West Loughton and Chequer bent, there is muoh   /  argument about nationalisation.          On the  other hand, my Leeds  correspondent reports     that in the whole of the West i-ttding he has  encountered     only one miner who opposed nationalisation and he  oomments     as follows on  the general attitude:                &quot;The real thing behind  this is that never                before have the miners seen evidenoes  of  the                wealth of the mine owners  as, during  late  years                with  the development of motor oars and the                describing  of  society  functions in  the pioture                and other papers.    Coupled with  this  is  the                 experience  many  of the younger men have had                 during  their travelling whilst in the  Army,                                                           being/
1being stationed in London end other bigtowns and seeing for themselves, the wealthand luxury of the other side of life.Everywhere in conversation one is met withthe remark &apos;We are no longer producing profitsfor that olass.&apos;&quot;THE.ri^LV/A,YIM?(          The threat of a railway strike at Christmas-time is     now empty.   The great body of railwaymen were against it     and the hot-headed minority were over-ruled.          It is reported that owing to the withdrawal of     Mr. Darlington, one of the National Union of Railwaymen     organising secretaries,  there will be no oontest for the    post of Industrial Secretary, for whioh Mr.  CT. Cramp    will receive a salary of  1,000 per annum.          The National Union  of Rallwayiaen is devoting special    attention at present to  industrial eduoation.          Branches have been  circularised and delegates from     the Central Labour College have been sent to districts     whioh are considered promising, to open olasses in    ,&quot;economics&quot; and &quot;industrial history&quot;,          My correspondent at Stoke-on-Trent sends the follow!!    report:               &quot;Much impatienoe is being shown by some of the          Railwaymen at the delay of the Conference of the          Railway Union leaders and the Government in reaching          a decision,               &quot;It is stated  that on some seotors of the Great          Western Hallway, particularly at Oxley  Sidings,          Wolverhampton, the  shunters are adopting the &quot;slow          movement&quot; action as a protest against J.  Thomas          keeping them in the dark as regards the progress of          negotiations.               &quot;This slow movement means that they are working          strictly to the rule book.   Trucks are not being          shunted but backed  into the sidings by  the engines          and time wasted.   Working by these conditions one          train is made up, where adopting the shunting method          two trains would be ready.               &quot;Nothing is said to the men and I  understand          they are being enoouraged in this by their own,,          inspectors.&quot;
PROFITEERING                            -    1          The outcry regarding high prices continues, and     there has been very strong criticism in the Labour Press     of the Co-operative support of Mde-oontrol&quot; of food,          Glasgow women  are talking of starting a &quot;League of     Housewives&quot; to demand more sugar for their ohildren.     They maintain that  the ration should be one pound per     head, before bakers and oonfeotioners are allowed an     apparently unlimited supply.          The Press reports of enormous  expenditure on  y,  luxuries, and of oostly sooiety functions, are inflaming     the mind of Labour.THE POLICE.  &apos;     &quot; - ::          In Liverpool the police strikers have opened a     propaganda oampaign.   On Deoember  14th, however, a     meeting in the Stadium was attended by about 2,000 people     only, &quot;most of whom  were ex-polioemen.   The speeohes     contained no&apos;new-matter and merely  revealed the strikers1     antipathy to the; Trade Unions which had failed to support     them.   The chairman, Councillor and Ex-Polioe Constable     Burdon, is probably the moving spirit in the campaign.          Working men, in Croydon propose that a voluntary levy     of Id. should be oolleoted from every Trade Unionist in   .  the distriot.  &apos;          In the Leeds  district there is still agitation for     the reinstatement of the strikers, and the Hull Trades     Council is organising a publio appeal for reinstatement.LABOUR COUNCILLORS.          It is interesting to note that in  Bermondsey, where     Labour, though not  in a majority, has apparently managed     to dominate the Council by means of united and onergetio     aotion, a supplementary rate of Is. lOd. in the  has     been levied.   Sixpenoe of this is  due  to the  increase of                                                            1/
      1 per week granted to all the Counoil employees.   It wa     stated at a recent meeting that during the month the    I     present counoil has been In office it has been responsible     for an expenditure of  14,725, for which no provision had     been mada in the estimates.   If this excess were maintaii     the estimates would be exceeded, at the end of the year,    &apos; by  176,700, a sum equivalent to an additional rate of     5s. 6d. in the  .          Ihe Chairman of the Bradford Finanoe Committee is     pressing for a system of municipal hanking.          In Hull the Labour Councillors are urging that     evening sittings should be held, for the oonvenienoe of     those who work by day.          Mr.  A.A. Watts of the London County Counoil has for     some time identified himself with extremists in the     Labour movement.   He oontributes an inflammatory article.     on unemployment and the cost of living to tho ourrent     issue of &quot;The. Call&quot;,in whioh he urges liabour to put the     Trade Union Congress Resolutions into effect5; r  &quot;If the     workers desire that these resolutions shall: become     operative, and not remain mere fsoraps of paper they     must aot either-politically or industrially-, or both.   ,  Either sweep the-ruling and possessing gang&apos;out of     power, or by direotaotion in the industrial field refusl     to go on with the necessary work of the nation.   If theyj-     are not tired of mere.resolutions, we are.   The next   ,  step is aotion,&quot;FEELING AMONGST EX-SOLDIEKS.  &apos;          &quot;Unemployment,among disoharged soldiers is provoking!     a restless and revolutionary spirit.   On Deoember 18th     a meeting of the National Federation of Disohargodivand     Demobilised Sailors1 and Soldiers held at Liverpool, whiol)     was attended by about 300 ex-soldiers and a few polioe                                                   strikers/
IDSstrikers, passed a resolution &quot;strongly &quot;condemning theapathy of the Government&quot;, demanding that employers beoompelled to aooept ex-servioe men,  that State faotoriesbe used for the absorption of more unemployed and thatthe prince of wales Fund be used for relief.  Onespeaker stated that a mass demonstration of Liverpoolunemployed ex-servioe men will take  plaoe on January 7th,1920.     I am informed that London leaders of the NationalUnion of Ex-Servioe Men oontemplate  disorderly actionunless employment is found for their members&apos;.  Thwyintend to appoint stewards whose duty it will be tokeep in touoh with 20-25 members eaoh, in order thatthey may be quickly assembled for any particular purpose.     Ex-Servioe men in Leeds are reported to be veryrestive.  Some are very discontented with theirassociations, others are inolined to be disloyal.  The&quot;Z&quot; Reserve men think that they are being retained .forstrike-breaking purposes.  They are pressing the TradeUnions to take up this matter and state they willrefuse to obey a mobilisation order, espeoially as theyreoeive no reserve pay,     The Ex-Servioe Men*s Union Branohes are supportingthis attitude and passing resolutions to that effect.The &quot;ohained man&quot;, A, H. WBigstaffe,  who is a money-  Ygetting impostor rather than a orank, has been through this area and oaused some stir and sympathy.  He isannouncing a march of 4,000 ex-servioe men toBuckingham Palace and is enrolling disabled men betweenEdinburgh and London to be oolleoted on his return journey.
M. 5 -         In the Welsh coalfields, the Independent labour Party    is oonduoting a vigorous oampaign on behalf of ex-servioe    men; the National Union of Ex-Servioe Men is gradually    gaining ground in South Wales and Monmouthshire where it    has an approximate membership of 5*000,  .CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES AND THE TRADE UNIONS.         On.December 15th, Mr. J.H. Thomas, addressing a meeting    of some 2,000 people at Newport under the ausploes of the    local&apos;Co-operative Society, said that there should be no    distinctions between Co-operation and labour; he was sure    that in the future they would be one movement.  This view    is corroborated by a remark made by an offioial of the    Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety to the effect that there    is a movement on foot to make all Trade Unionists   &apos; Co-operators and vioe vereS.         My Leeds correspondent thinks that the movement will    not become universal in his distriot unless a big strike    oaused the Government to interfere with the co-operators,    in whioh oase there would be .an inoentive which is absent    at present.                  .  , ,         National Union of Railwaymen branches in Crewe are    stated to be transferring their accounts to Co-operative    Banks.THE- AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF MGINEERS &apos;         Aooording to the current number of&apos;the &quot;Monthly    Journal and Report&quot; the membership and funds of the Sboiety    show a deoided increase during the year; the figures are:                            Deo. 191b      Deo, 1919    Inoi-eau?

     In the &quot;Editor&apos;s Notes&quot; Tom itenn,  the  General  Secretary,advocates the control o:f Industry by the workers in hiscustomary style and, taking the moulders&apos;strike as  his test,pleads for one union for all engineers.  He urges allengineers to become oo^operators because &quot;We shall  stand  in need of exactly such services as it will be in the  power  ofthe oo^perative movement to render&quot;.  Of the award of theCourt of Arbitration in the engineers1  demand for an increaseof 15s. he1 writes:          &quot;What is to: be said of it?  Is such a     humiliating state of affairs to be aoquiesoed  in?     M thousand times, No!  What then ? shal 1 we enter     upon a strike to enforce it?  Not yet, brothers, not     yet.  Why not?  Beoause we are too sectional as yet,     and we must alter this.  To enter upon a struggle     with organised capital backed by the law, and  no     proper oontrol of the oommissariat would be madness,     and I at any rate am not for it.  Militancy?  Yes;     undoubtedly,  When?  Right now; but it must take     the rigivt torn; we must have control of the essentials     of life; we must be able to feed the women and     children, and then, well, Whatever may be neoessary.     So get ready without delay; but the absolutely     essential preliminaries are, a genuine understanding     with ail organised workers; a thorough working agrees     ment with all trades in the industry,  and such a close     relationship with the Co-operative movement as will     enable us to handle the distribution of necessities     satisfactorily.          &quot;In this work the works Committees and Shop     Stewards&apos; movement can and will be of the greatest     service.  With these comrades it rests largely to     give tone and direction to the educational efforts     now being made and whioh will be made on a larger     scale in the immediate future.  Do not fear but that     the maohinery of the union will move with the     requisite speed and effiolenoy when the real breath     of life is put into it by a truly intelligent     rank and file.&quot;         ; The result of the voting on the Is. levy  in aid     of the ironmouldfcrs was:                      For;          25,676                      Against:       3,092          She levy will be collected in two instalments     of 6d.

THE CITIZEN GUARD OF.SWITZERLAND           A detailed report of the Organisation - of the Citizen      Guard in Switzerland may&apos;be .interesting in view of the      proposal to institute a body of this kind in England      after the recent railway strike.           In common with moet European countries, Switzerland      has faced a se2?ious labour crisis and the &quot;Schweizerisohar      Vaterlandisoher Verband&quot; (&quot;Swiss Fatherland (Patriotic)      League&quot;) sprang into existence during the general strike      of 1918.  The movement was spontaneous in the larfeer      cities such as Basel, Zurioh, Geneva, Aargau,and was      simultaneously supported by the peasants&apos; organizations.      It now represents the amalgamation of the various Swiss      patriotic societies and  covers praotioally the whole      oountry.           In normal times  the Guard holds a watohlng brief      for industrial peace; its funotions fall into three      oategories:-           (i)   A Press Department whioh oolleots information                from agents and other sources; issues a weekly                confidential report and combats Bolshevism in                the Press and  by means of leaflets.           (ii)   A Central Department, whioh works out a                system of communication, arranges substitute                labour for vital servioes in the event of a                strike and organises  lectures on sooial and                political topios.          (iii)   k Besearoh Department whioh.is devoted to the                study of Spartaoism.           In times  of industrial upheaval, however, the      Guard becomes  virtually  part of the military machine.   It      is reoognised  by the Police, under whose authority it      remains until  the military are  called in, when the use  of                                                   weapons/
                                                            (fweapons, pay and pensions are the same as for the Army.     The organization of the Guard is oentred in a FederalCommission with administrative powers, whioh holds offioefor 3 years, and in an Exeoutive Council; the offloors arePresident, Vioe President, Secretary  (paid), assistant secretary, Treasurer and Archivist,  Detailed organizationis apparently largely local, however, and varies in aooordanowith the requirements and politios of canton, town or villageEaoh urban or rural seotion is under a local leader who has afmilitary adviser; .in case of need the latter takes command .and is responsible to the Military-Authority,  Eaoh districtis responsible for its own safety and organizes a reliefservice for  transport, post, telegraph and  telephone servicesArms for oivllian members, who wear a brassard or a.uniform,are stored in a oentral depot;  machine  guns and munitions ar(stationed at various places.     Eaoh distriot has a quarter-master, dootor and medicaldetaohment.  During the first two days,  members must providetheir  own, rations, after whioh period the &quot;military&quot;authorities  are responsible, though schemes for  the supplyand  transport  of provisions  are  drawn up by the  Guard,      Soldiers  are  eligible for membership,  and when called up can be  exoused  service with their  regiments;  they wearuniform and  oarry  the usual  arms.      During the  general  strike in August,  1919,  the,Guardwas  mobilised  in  Zurich.   The Military  oommander of the town  delayed the mobilisation order,  and,  in oonsequenoe,many members were  absent  on  holiday.  . A detailed commentary shows that  on  the  whole  the  Guard acted exceedingly well. Their leader,  however,  lays  stress  on the  difficulty  of      /maintaining an effective  disciplined  force, when the  seotiona                                                  have/
have no training, and, exoept in an emerganoy, exist onlyon paper.  He is of opinion that the Guard should have beenmobilised earlier in order that it could have taken up itsstations before aotually being used,   He adds also thatthe proportion of military effectives to other elements was too low,&apos; emphasises the invaluable help of the Guardsintelligence service and recommends that all members shouldwear uniform.     It is interesting to note that the existenoe of theGuard was quite unknown to outsiders,  &quot;Hie Guards&apos; appearanoecreated great astonishment and is said by a social democraticleader to have saved the situation.  There was no bloodshed.A REVOLUTIONARY: S OPINION OF THE ARMY AND NAVY     In a previous report I referred to the efforts ofoertain Labour extremists to win over the Army and Navy; inthis connection some remarks&apos; of W. Paul,  in a speeoh atLeeds on December 14th, are not uninteresting,  referring to Glasgow during the reoent railway strike, he sald:-          &quot;We can always rely on the Jack Tar.  Some of the     workers asked them if they were going to bleoklog the     workers, but the sailors replied, &quot;If we dcn&apos;t tcuoh     the boilers they will be out of use for a mcnth, but     if we do touch them they will be out of use for six     months.    The sailors can always arrange such, little     oversights as firing a boiler without any water .....     The soldiers too are on our side.  You will notioe     that all the armed Foroes are concentrated at one     point in the event of a dispute - such as Glasgow, or     South Wales, or Liverpool - but if we have a dispute     in every large town ana oity, the Foroes will be so     divided as to,beoome useless.tt     As firing an empty boiler may result in an explosionand serious injury to the stokers it may be assumed thatthe sailors were &quot;pulling the leg&quot; of their interrogatorsif they really made the remark.i fjqA- vJ UEXTREMIST/

The finance of the &quot;Daily Eetald&quot; is subjected to     stringent criticism in the current issue of &quot;Justioe&quot;, whioh     ridioules the idea of effective Trade Union support.          The &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; has a scathing article on     the  *reformist&apos; &quot;Daily Herald&apos;&apos;&quot; whioh &quot;drifts sts&amp;dily to     the right.&quot;        ... An.increase in the circulation of the Industrial Workers     of the World organ &quot;Solidarity&quot; and of the &quot;Workers Dreadnough     is reported; of the former 5,600 copies are claimed to have     been sold last month and the sales cf the latter are said  to     have risen to about 10,000 per month. .          My Woolwich correspondent says that there is great     dissati-sfaotion .with the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Pioneer&quot;, beoause     they out down or throw in the wastepaper-baEket news that  is.     sent  to-them for publication&apos;,&apos;                      v; ...

Cramp, Tom Mann and Webb of the Electrioal Trades     Unions:                     .            -   &quot;Before veiy. long-there will be the biggest.A           strike the world has ever seen,  lhe principal          participants will be the Triple Allianoe and the          B.T.U.&quot;                                                THE/
THE IxilSH MOVEMENT IN ENGLAND    -         - q&amp;e Self-Iteie^     on behalf of the Irish National Loan.  I referred in my last     report to a subscription of  101 by the Paddington Branoh     and the Sum of  186, of whioh  135 was in gold, is now     reported to have&quot;been subscribed by the Tooting branch of     the League,           I am informed that in  trie Blackburn distriot all     the Irish element, whether  Sinn Fein or otherwise, is     working in oonjunotion with the Independent Labour Party     and Sooialist Parties.&apos;  In  Leeds also the Irish have     identified themselves with  the Labour Party.  IRELAND   ,.           The general condition  of the Frovinoes shows no     improvement  and  while  the counties  of. Clare and  Cork remain     speoially unsatisfactory the  number of acts of lawlessness     reported from other p^rta of the country was greater and  more     widespread than  usual,  culminating  in the dastardly attempt     on the life  of  the Viceroy.  There  is very little  doubt     that  this,&apos;like the  murders of Policemen, was organized  by     the secret jaooiety known as the  Irish Republican Brotherhood.           With the exception of  the  Irish Volunteers, who were     undoubtedly  responsible for the  large number  of  arms  raids     during the week, none  of the societies  suppressed by the   ^     Proclamation of 25th ultimo have  shown  any  signs of activity     and the members of Sinn Fein Clubs  have ceased to meet     openly.  Very little interest or  oomment seems to be     occasioned  in the  Provinoes by the  proposed Home Rule Bill,-     though information has just been  reoeived from a source,                                                    which/
which has hitherto proved most reliable, to the effeotthat Sinn Fein is more bitterly opposed to Home fiule, orany settlement exoept on its own lines, than ever, and thatopportunity will bei taken wlieh the Bill is introduced tomake the uncompromising attitude of Sinn Fein plain to theworld.  It is possible that the anxiety to obtain arms has some oonneotion with this, and there Is a very restlessand disturbed feeling beneath the surface.     The chief feature in the industrial situation atpresent is the agitation in oonneotion with the MotorPermit Order, Whioh has beoome a political patter because it is a serious embarrassment to the conspirators who areorganizing armed outrages.  Ihe great majority of motorowners in the Provinoes have made no difficulty aboutapplying for permits, but many paid drivers refuse to doso.  A number^ of these would undoubtedly apply for permitsif the Motor Drivers and Meohanios Union to whioh theybelong would allow them to do so.  The Irish transport and General Workers1 Union is keenly interested in this and, some of its branohes are endeavouring to bring outother unions in sympathy with the mo^or strikers.
