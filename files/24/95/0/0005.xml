(laiS   QCUMEiiT IS W  PROPERTY  OF HIS  BRITAMMIC  MAJESTY1 S GOYSHMIJ3HT) *(T.C.-16).     &apos;    ACTIVITIES 7/HICH TEE GOVERNMENT MAY UNDER&quot;TAKE DURIHG A STRIKE,Note by the Minister of Transport.     I circulate.  for the information of my colleagues,the attached memorandum regarding the activities which theGovernment could undertake during a strike without reason-ably being accused of &quot;strike-breaking&quot;.     The Supply ana Transport Sub-Conmittee bare consideredthe question as to what activities the Government maylegitimately undertake during a strike without being accused of strike breaking, and they desire to offer the following observations     &apos;7hile it is improbable that the Government can escapebeing accused of strike breaking by some section of thecommunity, whatever services it undertakes, its duty as aGovernment requires it tc maintain the life of the communityagainst all dangers, and it must do this regardless of its effect on either party to a strike.   There is little doubtthat public opinion would support the Government in maintain^Ing the essentials of life, no matter what the subject in dispute may be.     At the beginning of a,general strike the essential services required of the Government would be :1.  The transport and distribution of essential    food supplies;2..  The maintenance1 of war supplies;3.  The maintenance of essential supplies of    household coal;4.  The maintenance of sanitary services;5.  The provision of a minimum of lighting;6.:  The maintenance of transport and communica-    tion necessary for those purposes and for    the working of the Government itself;7.  The protection of all engaged in the above    Services(Signed)  ERIC  GEDI33S.16th December,  1919,Memorandum by Sir Rhys &quot;ill jams.The
20T1      ?he  obligation  on  the  Government  to perform the above services  during a strike  is the  justification of preparation beforehand.      The  question whether the Government should exceed the;limits  described above  and  attempt to  carry on the ordinary business  of  the country is more  difficult and its answer depends on the extent and duration of  the strike.  The Sub- Committee &apos;&quot;are of opinion  that at  the outset of a strike the Government would not be justified in declaring its intention of carrying  on the industry affected if the object in view were  merely  the maintenance of the normal business activity of the  country.  If, however, as would probably be the case later on  in  a strike, the maintenance  of such activity wore essential to the preservation of  the Swaie, the Government would be  justified in using every endeavour to this end. If, for instance, during a Railway or  Transport strike, a large industrial population were thrown out of.employment, and ft appeared  to be impracticable to maintain such a population by means  of  unemployment pay, the supply of coal and raw materials to industries would be a work cf necessity since failure to provide such supplies might lead to great social disturbances.      The  Sub-Committee  feel that.it.is impossible to indicate more  precisely in advance what activities (outside those referred  to  above as oscoataal to the.  life of the community,) the Government may properly undertake  during a rcrike.  The nature of the measures  to be taken, must be determined by events, and  during a strike it would be necessary that the Cabinet Committee should decide from.day.to day what services ought then to be undertaken to maintain the life of the community.(Signed).
