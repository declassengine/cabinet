Military Secret.fwFrom Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India&apos;/            *      &quot;   oht December 19.19.                    (Received 1st January 1920.)      17360.  31st December.   Malleson, 25tli December, repeated Tehran, Baghdad,  Constantinople:- -      &quot; From various sources I. gather that Bolsheviks look to  approaching capture of  Krasnovodsk as heralding final collapse of Denikin and inauguration of 1920 campaign  against  British everywhere  in Asia.   Meetings  of  Turkish,  Bolshevik, Afghan  and  German agents  in  Turkestan  have  been  frequent of  late.   Expect Caspian Fleet  immediately to come, over to them on  capture of Krasnovodsk, and point out that with  Krasnovodsk and Astrakhan in Bolshevik hands,. Baku  hostile, and Petrovsk cut off,  if not already captured, fleet will  be left with no means of  supply and refit unless it  turns Bolshevik   With command of  Caspian assured Bolsheviks say that they can  :  (1)  (corrupt group) volunteer (corrupt group)s ;  (2)  inaugurate revolution throughout  Caucasus;  (3) invade Northern Persia ; (4.) give signal for  Turkish national move-  ment on Mesopotamia ; and, finally, with large numbers  now entering Turkestan from  centre encourage, or, if necessary, compel, renewal of hostilities between Afghanistan,  and India.   This is to be accompanied,  by intense pan-Islamic agitation and fomenta-  tion of local grievances everywhere.      &quot; 2. Few weeks ago Bolsheviks were, by own admission,  on  point of  collapse for  want of oil and fuel.  Capture  of  Ivrasnovodsk,  access  to  Baku, and entry into Don  Basin will, they claim, place them in a position to carry out whole of above programme.  They also state that huge captures from Kolchak give them ample supplies of warlike  materials.      &quot; 3. Their great remaining  difficulty  appears  to  be money.   They are posting  placards throughout Turkestan, imploring people  not  to believe lies circulated by  British Mission in Meshed regarding  worthlessness  of rouble  notes.   Being badly in       B  need of  many  commodities only to be obtained from foreign countries, they are doing  utmost to  persuade foreign countries to accept their paper.   They are said even to be  offering large  territorial concessions  to Afghanistan and  Bokhara in exchange for  official recognition (? of) paper money.   Any propaganda resulting in depreciation of  that money is  severe blow to Bolsheviks.      &quot; 4.  There are  many evidences of ceaseless activity of  Bolsheviks in propaganda  work.   Swarms of agents are under intense training in various centres and will  Soon  be let loose in neighbouring countries.  Many are already at work, but far more are  still to come.&quot;
