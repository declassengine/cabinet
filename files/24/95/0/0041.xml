\ 7 a..                   (This Document is the  Property of                   His  Britannic  (V!a!esty&apos;s  Government)Military  Secret:&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos;        ?    HIT&quot;                //From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,                                     IWi December 1919.^ AllGj^^                        (Received 22nd.)            16895.  Malleson telegraphs on 11th December :             &quot; With improved wireless telegraphy apparatus we  are now intercepting  very        large number  of messages, running to thirty or  more foolscap pages daily.  If we        are to obtain full benefit of this it is  essential to  strengthen  (? Mission) forthwith        with competent Russian interpreters.   Gordon is due to  leave this  month, and I thus        require two Russian  speaking officers as (corrupt group).  Moreover,  if  I  am  to        distribute full information to Delhi and elsewhere use of new cyphers will necessitate        much  extra work.   If  British officers are now  being  withdrawn from Deniken it        should be possible to get really good interpreters from there.  In addition to wireless        intercepts there is much interrogation of Russian  speaking agents  and refugees and        also Austrian-German prisoners of&apos;war, for whom  German interpreter  is required.&quot;            We, agree with Malleson and consider it  important to meet his requirements  as        soon as possible.  If  approved we would  request you to ask War Office urgently if        they can supply and despatch  officers asked  for  forthwith as we  have  no  qualified        officers here available.
