KING&apos;S  SPEECH  FOR  THE  PROROGATION  OF PARLIAMENT.MY LOEDS  AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    AFTER many months of arduous deliberation in  Paris, the efforts of thePlenipotentiaries  of the Allied and Associated Powers  have been crowned with success, and Treaties of Peace with Germany, Austria and  Bulgaria have been concluded.  In the negotiations the Prime Ministers of all  My  Dominions and representatives of India took an  influential part.  I  have signified My approvalof the  Treaty of Peace with Germany and have ratified it.  Peace still remains to be concluded with the Ottoman Empire and the  Republic of Hungary, andI earnestly trust  that the necessary negotiations  for this purpose will shortly be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.    I regret that  there is no improvement in the unhappy conditions prevailing in Russia,  and that  there  is no immediate prospect in that  country  of theestablishment  of  Constitutional Government, which  alone can  conduce  to  itspermanent prosperity.    My relations with My Allies and Associates in the  Great War remain of themost friendly character, and I have every expectation that the close and  intimateco-operation which led to victory will be long continued to the benefit of all.    In August last My  Government concluded with the Persian Government anAgreement  tending to cement the ties of friendship  between the two countries,which have so many interests in common, and to promote the welfare and progressof Persia.   I have since had the pleasure of entertaining  the Shah on his firstvisit to Europe.    The signal success which has attended the visit of the Prince of &quot;Wales to-Canada and  Newfoundland has  filled  My heart with feelings of  pride andsatisfaction.  The overwhelming enthusiasm with which My  Son  was everywherewelcomed affords  a fresh proof of the affectionate  loyalty which animates all my peoples, and  I rejoice that his visit has strengthened the ties  of comradeshipwhich unite the various countries of the Empire.  He  subsequently visited theUnited States of  America, where  he was greeted with a warmth and kindlinesswhich will,  I am confident, have the happiest effect on the relations between theBritish Empire and that great Republic.    The whole Empire mourns the  death of General  Botha, one  of the greatestand wisest of its Statesmen.  The sagacity and far-sightedness which made him the trusted leader of the people  of the  Dominion of South Africa,  and whichcontributed so much to the success of the Allies, won universal recognition atthe recent deliberations in Paris.    A  measure which marks the first stage in the development of responsible government in  India has become law, and I  rely on all  My Subjects to work together for its success,   In a Proclamation which I am addressing to My viceroy and to  the Princes and People of India, I am expressing My hope that harmonious.political life will be  steadily built up on the foundations thus laid, and I  amannouncing My intention of  sending My Son, the Prince  of Wales, to  India to inaugurate the new Constitution.                                                                   rMEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    I thank you for  the provision that you have made  for the service  of a year in which public  expenditure has necessarily continued on an  abnormal scalelargely exceeding both  the permanent and temporary revenue.  I  trust thatnext year, with the  return to more normal conditions,  you will  be able to take      [1783]
the first steps in the reduction of the National Debt.  The condition  of  ourfinances  and the state of our credit continue to occupy the serious attention ofMy Ministers.  Only by strict economy in both  public and private expenditure and by sustained increase of production  can the country maintain its  historicposition in commerce and finance.MY LORDS  AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,    I cannot view without concern the grave economic position of a large part ofEurope.  The task of restoring credit and restarting industry in the countries whoseeconomic life has been destroyed by,five years of war is one of the first conditionsof a return to settled peace, but it is too large a task for any nation to undertakeunaided.  I was enabled by the liberality of Parliament to place a large sum at thedisposal  of the Supreme Economic Council for the relief of immediate necessities,but  that  sum is now  nearly exhausted.   Further  measures  of  relief  and reconstruction can only be undertaken as the result of joint action by all nationsinterested in the restoration of international commerce.  My  Government would gladly co-operate with the Governments of other countries to this end if a suitableplan can be devised.    Great  progress has been made during the past year  in the gigantic  task ofdemobilising My  Navy, Army and Air Force, impeded  as it  has been by the uncertainties of the situation in large parts  of Europe and Asia.    The lot  of the men who have served in My Forces  during  the  &quot;War,  and-especially of those who are disabled, has been the subject of anxious consideration.It is a source of great satisfaction to Me that it has been  possible to increase the scales of  pension paid to war veterans and to the dependents of those who gave their lives in the  War.  I am glad to know  that very large numbers of men have been-absorbed in  peaceful industries, but it is important that employment should be within the reach of all who are able to take advantage of it.  To this end I havemade an appeal  to  the  employers of the country which  has received  a largeresponse.  But more remains to be done, and I  am hopeful  that  the measureswhich  have  been and are  being   taken  for giving them training in  skilledoccupations and  for placing  them in employment will have  the  ready  supportof all My  People.    Measures have also  been passed to facilitate the settlement on the  land of-ex-service  men who have fought  in the War, and for providing them  with thenecessary assistance in establishing themselves in agriculture.    The continued high cost of living, with all its evil consequences, has causeddistress  throughout  the  world, though it  is lower  in the British Isles  thanelsewhere.   The problem of  reducing it has received your constant consideration,and measures  have been taken which  it  is  hoped may prevent the charging ofunreasonable prices for necessary articles.    In the sphere of domestic  legislation the Session has been  marked by thepassage of an  unprecedented number  of Bills dealing with reconstruction in all its aspects.    Important measures have  been passed affecting  the conditions of labour.There  is  no  doubt  that  public opinion   throughout  the  world  is  deeplyinterested  in  the manner  in which  Great  Britain  is dealing with its labourand industrial problem,  and  I am confident that though  the  difficult timesare not  yet  past  our course is set fair  towards a renewal of national  strengthand prosperity.  I am  glad  to think that  there has been  a steady improve-nient  in  industrial  conditions.   Unemployment, which  in  the earlier  partof  the  year was unexampled in extent,   stands  to-day at  a  figure  whichcompares  favourably with the years  prior  to the War.  This  is all the  moreremarkable considering  the  immense  numbers of  men  and women  discharged from the services and from  munition works  at  home.  The  Acts for restoringprivileges  surrendered during the War  and for stabilising  the  conditions ofemployment have done much  to avoid   friction in  the  industrial  life of
the  country.   The  establishment of an  Industrial  Court  has provided  themachinery for  securing  the  peaceful  settlement  of disputes  and promotingharmony among  those  engaged in industry.   These measures form part  of  a programme  which it has  not been found  possible to complete in the present session.   Proposals have been formulated for fixing a maximum number of hoursof  employment,  for instituting a minimum  wage,  and for making increased provision against unemployment.  I trust that at an early date they may receivethe assent of Parliament.    I have  given My assent to an Act  constituting a Ministry of  Agriculture,Agricultural Councils for England and Wales, an Advisory Committee  to assistthe Minister, and providing for the decentralisation of Agricultural administration to Committees of the County Councils.    I have also assented to Bills for the establishment of the  Ministry of health in England, and a  Board of Health in Scotland,  and a Council of Health inIreland.   I  anticipate that when they are in full working  order  they will  proveinvaluable in co-ordinating and improving the service of the health of  the people.    The Housing and Town Planning Acts which were passed in July, and theHousing (Additional Powers) Act to which I have  just given assent,  mark  anew departure in housing legislation;  and it is  My sincere hope that  these measures  will  facilitate the  solution of the  housing problem  in  the UnitedKingdom  by providing  increased and better accommodation  and leading to the progressive  elimination  of  insanitary dwellings.    I view  with  satisfaction the passing of the Act to establish a Ministry ofTransport.  The creation of an effective system of transport will greatly contribute to agricultural and  industrial development,  to the solution of  the  housingproblem and to the  reparation of the immense losses inflicted on the country bythe War.    Upon  these  measures  the future  prosperity  of  the country  very largelydepends.    The pressure on the time of Parliament has made  it impossible  to  enact inits entirety the  Electricity  Supply Bill as passed by the  House of Commons.Provision has, however,  been made which enables the necessary Commissioners tobe established and the preliminary steps to be taken in the  reorganisation of this vital  industry.   A  portion of this  Bill was temporarily  postponed with theobject of  giving adequate time to Parliament to deliberate fully upon its terms.It is greatly hoped, however, that upon the re-assembly of Parliament considera-tion of the remaining portion will be resumed.    In addition to these Bills a number of other Acts, relating to the Acquisitionof Land,  Patents and  Designs, Trade-marks, Wireless Telegraphy, and  othermatters of importance in  the practical work of reconstruction, have received Myassent.December 22,1919.
