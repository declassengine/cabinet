Act,  1916.&quot;Pa^e 2,  Line 14.   for  -0,000 read  10,000.000
CAB  IN ft  2.     I desiro to circulate to tho Cabinet for their information the following Memorandum by Sir Howard tfranfc.  .THE MIMIOTEg pji; MIMTIOIIS.      I think it essential to place before the Cabinet the position with  regard to lands and buildings which, having been taken over for war purposes, are still in Govern iont occupation.      The Departments for which I act are still in occupation ofabout 200,000 acres of such land, including nearly 180 aerodromssbGSides factories, camps, submarine stations, buildings of. variousdescriptions (all constructed or erected at Government expense),and lands occupied for defence works,     A certain amount of this land will be required permanentlyfor Government purposes and a portion of the remainder upon whichlittle expenditure, if any, has been incurred, can be handedbacic to the owners as soon as the Government no longer requiresi%i but it is with tho residue that I am now concerned^     This residue consists of land on which there has been asubstantial expenditure of public funds either in the erection of buildings or in levelling, draining, road-making otc.  this expenditure varioo from a few thousand pounds to millions.,     But for tho Acquisition of Land Act, 1916, tho Governmentwould as regards such lands be entirely in the owners&apos; hands,19th December,1919.I
                                                         &apos;    1Q4as there would bo no alternative,  exoopt  with the owner&apos;o consent,to handing baok the land with an:/ improvements that could not beremoved and obtaining scrap value  for such as could be  removed,subject, in the latter case, to reinstatement of the site.     This would havo meant losing practically the whole of theexpenditure incurred on land for war purposes, and demolishingbuildings that might bo of great uso for  industrial objects.     It was to avoid these results that tho Acquisition of LandAct was passed.  This Act enables  Government Departments, withthe consent of tho Railway and Canal Commission to acquire suchlands corapuloorily without paying for their own improvements and,having acquired thorn, to dispose of them.  Tims if buildings,costing  150,000 and now worth  100,000,  have been erected on land worth  10,000 the land can be acquired for  60,000 andresold with the buildings for  110,000.   The &quot;scrap&quot; value ofthe buildings might bo  4,000 which might be more than swallowedup in reinstatement.     Some owners are objecting strongly to parting with their  lands,not infrequently because they are anxious to get for themselves  asmuch of the benefit of Government expenditure as possible. Tho mostviolent protest yet mado is that of Lord Rosebery which, by reasonof its  inaccuracies and of the publicity he obtained by sending hisversion - a misleading one, to the Oross at first created an impression In the public mind that the Government is seeking toconfiscate private property for the purpose of recovering war expenditure.     Unless the Government is prepared to give up the attempt to recover any substantial part  of tho exponditure incurred  on landfor war purposes and to lose  millions, they must make a strongstand against this agitation  on tho part of  owners who are puttingtheir  own  interosts before those of the  public.                         (2)
1.105     There is no peculiar hardship in tho  cases  now under  con-.sideration.  The owner will in any caso be entitled to  the fullmarket value of his land except in so far  as  that  value ha3 beenenhanced by Government expenditure, and if the severance of theland from the rent of his estate depreciates  the latter will  beentitled to compensation for such depreciation.     The protest, in fact, is not a protest against the action ofany department so much as against tho guiding prlnoiple and main object of the Acquisition of land Act.     A protest is also made against our advertising for disposalproperty on which we have erected buildings before wo havo pur-chased tho site, oven although wo state in the advertisement  thatthe land is hold under D.O.R.A., and can,  if necessary, be acquired under and subject to the powers conferred upon the government by tho Acquisition of Land Aot,l$16, the suggestionbeing that wo are advertising for sale land which we  havo  not yetbought.  It will be seen, however, that there is nothing misleadingin the advertisement * the wording of which was approved by theTreasury Solicitor, and  our reason for advertising in those cases is that it is impossible  in any other way to  ascertain whether there is any demand for  the buildings in  situ.      As an illustration of this  point  I would mention  j?elthamAerodrome,  on which we  have  spent  hundreds of thousands of pounds. The  highest offer we  could  obtain by private negotiationwas  200,000, but  in  response to  an advertisement in preciselytho  same wording as that used for Lord  Rosobery:s  land, and  towhich no  exoeotion was  tax on, we  havo  sinco  rocelvod an offer of double  that  amount,  the  purchaser being willing to  pay us  . in addition whatever  we have  to  pay for the  land,      The  objoct of tho  Act  was clearly to enable  the Government to recover the  residual value of its war  exponditure.   But to buy                                 (3)
sites without first endeavouring to ascertain whether there isa market for tho &quot;buildings orectod on thorn would bo to riskthrowing good money after bad, since many of tho buildings were designed for special purposes, and the possibility oftheir continued use for thoso purposes or their adaptationfor other purposes can only be tested by advertisement, there being no exocrienco to guide us.10,.12.19.
