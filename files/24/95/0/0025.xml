THIS rt o bUMENT is the Property of     ;v&apos;nnic Majesty&apos;8 Government.CAB I II E TCOTIDTiffTIAL. C.P.32fr           (Copy of a letter from Assistant Secretary,             Office of Worts,  to Secretary,  Cabinet).-      (Circulated with reference, to Paper No;CP.267)H.M.0EPICE OJ1 WORKS,     Storey1s Gate,Mo: 61652/1919..       Sir,S.f .1.19th Deoember,  1919.1*     With reference  to  .ie  memorandum which has been  submitted to  the  Cabinet by the  Minister  of Transport  as  to the suggested  removal of the  Cenotaph to  another  site,  I am directed  by the  First Commissioner of His  Majesty1B Works,  etc.,  to represent,  for  the information  of  the Cabinet, the  following  considerations which,  in  his opinion, make it  most unda&amp;irable  to reverse the  decision  already  arrived at           (a) The House  of Commons has now  voted  the money             reojiired for the re-erection  of the  Cenotaph             on its present  site.   The Einancial Secretary             to the Treasury made  a special point of             this  in  Committee  and except that one member             spoke in favour of removal, no opposition             was raised.   Eroin notices in the Press there             seems no doubt,  moreover, that this  decision             is baoked by the overwhelming mass of public             opilion.(b)  Any reversal of the decision would raise    the question of design.   The Cenotaph    was specially designod for Its present,site,    and it is cert a impost likely that its , -    removal to Parliament Square, or elsewha-e,    would involve a recasting of the whole scheme    so  that the special significance of the    present Memorial would be entirely lost.               (o) As Sir [Frederick Banbury pointed out in the                   House of Commons, the historical associations                   of the present site will come more and more into                   prominence,  while what may be termed the purely                   personal appeal of the monument (to the relatives                   of the fallen) will necessarily diminish as time                   goes on.        2.    The  suggestion  made in his previous submission.to        the  Cabinet as to limiting the occasions on which flowers        might be  placed on the  Memorial, had partly in view the        objections raised on account of traffic obstruction,  and it        is suggested that the Cabinet might reconsider this point.The Secretary,              I am, Sir,     Cabinet,          2, Whitehall gdns..,   Your obedient servant,                S.W.I.                                      - (Signed) JAMES BGGAR.
