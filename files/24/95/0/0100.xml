locmrient fs  the Pr.-l:.:fl:......l^/esty&apos;s Gofoperty ofit.)/Military  Secret.1241MR. CJLiid2nd January.  Malleson wires, 30th December : From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,                     3rd January 1920.                       (Received 4th.)    &quot; Tashkend.  I have received lengthy report, dated end of November, from myagent.   He is Russian engineer, and is in touch with Bolshevik  circles.   Much of his information we already know from  wireless and other sources.   Following  are main points : Large reinforcements of Red troops from Centre, who began arriving earlyin November.  General Brusiloff arrived Tashkend,  17th November.  After capture of Krasnovodsk, Bolsheviks will open up Kagan-Termez  route.  Bolsheviks all say  itis settled policy to deal with Persia  and India in 1920.   The new troops from Centreare very fine  material.   They  were all told, when starting  for Turkestan, that  theywere destined for Persia and India &apos; for the freeing of  the East from  the  Englishyoke.&apos;   Bolshevik policy is to assist  Pan-Islam agitation in every possible way.  Theyhave nothing in common with it, and eventually must openly break with Islam ;  butfor the  present they regard  it as very potent  weapon  against  English.  Economicsituation, food,  fuel and practically everything else being  lacking, is very serious.Everyone  is  nominally Bolshevik since others would quickly starve.  But there  arevery few sincere  Bolsheviks, even amongst Russians, and practically none amongstMahometans.   All the  parades, demonstrations, resolutions  and telegrams  to Leninare engineered by  Bolshevik  officials, and in no way represent real convictions ofinhabitants.  There  will be  very  severe  famine in the towns this  winter.  the peasants have hidden stores  of grain  and can  hold   out  longer.  Bokhara  andKhiva are largely under British direction, and their attitude  to Bolsheviks is reserved.Bolsheviks will do utmost to persuade Afghans  to renew war  against India.  Bitteranti-British propaganda is spreading everywhere.  Nevertheless all population would welcome British rule.&quot;    Paras.  1  and  2 repeated to Teheran under No. 5622-49.
