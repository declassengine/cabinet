My telegram  of  24th November,  .1592 S.Malnnud Tarzi lias replied to  Foreign Secretary&apos;s letter regarding Afghan Consul-General at Peshawar.    He admits  correctness of statement that prior sanction of Home Government tocreation of Consular posts is necessary,  but points out  that under the  old  customAfghan agents  were appointed in India without such sanction being obtained.  Heemphasises necessity for some Afghan  agent at  Peshawar, whatever his designation,as all necessaries  of  life  frpm abroad  go to Kabul from  Peshawar, but  agrees  that matters must be  postponed till friendship treaty is  discussed.  He concludes: &quot;Istrongly hope that you will endeavour to cause  arrival  of occasion for such discussionso that discussions may be commenced  with good intention and with earnestness  andsincere desire at early moment; and  firm treaty  of friendship  may be concluded  and established between two Governments because  there is scarcely any time left  and delay is considered injurious to both parties.&quot;
