     Unemployment insurance is at present confined tcabout 3i- million workpeople covered by the national insurance (Unemployment) Acts,- 1911 to 1918*  The Billnew in preparation proposes to extend it so as to coversubstantially the same field as the Health Insurancescheme with the exception of agriculture and domestic service.  Certain further exceptions are also proposedin Ireland.  The Bill will apply the principle of compulsion to all occupations (with the exceptionsspecified), but will contain provisions enablingindustries, which are able and willing to do so, to sotup special schemes for dealing with their ownunemployment c.      It is important to introduce the Hill this Session,if possible, and give it a First Heeding, in order thatthe recess may be used for consulting the industrialorganisationaB     It will be convenient to describe first the generalscheme, and then the arrangements under which industriesmay set up special schemes.Gene ry. 1 schetne t .     Whilst the field covered by the Bill will be practically co-terminous with that of the healthinsurance scheme, the details of the general scheme ofunemployment insurance will be substantially the- same asth-ise laid down in the existing Unemployment insurance acts. ,     Contributions from employers and employed will becompulsory and  there will be a State contribution of;ne-.fourth of  the whole.  Provisionally the nates, of contribution from employers and employed are as follows:&quot;EmployersEmployedTotal.OV;d3d,3fd3d.7d,6d,
     Tho weekly  rate3 of benefit proposed are 15s. for menand 12s. for  women.     Certain  lowor rates of contributions  and benefit  are proposed for  boys-and girls between the ages of 16 and 18,     Whilst the  rates  of  contribution are provisionally a3stated,  it is possible  that,  ao  a  result of  certainalterations of the  original  scheme  and re-examination of thefigures by .the Actuary, a  somewhat  lower rate of contribution will  be sufficient  in order to  provide thebenefits of 15s.  and 12s., and it  may be that thecontributions in respect of  men and women  respectively, willbe 6d. and 5d.,  half being paid in each  case by the employer and half by the  employed.     The payment of benefit  under  the general scheme will,in the  normal course,  be made through tho  EmploymentExchanges, but in order to enable Trade  U nions to take partin the  administration of benefit in cases  -where there  is  no special scheme for  an industry, it is proposed  to apply theexisting provision under which a Trade Union may pay  out  theState Benefit to its members and subsequently recover  it                                                       ifrom the  rft his try of Labour.  Trade Unions making thisarrangement  have not, In the past, received any grant  towardsadministrative expenses, but have received certain repaymentsunder  Sec titan 106 of the  National Insurance Act,  1911, -whichthey regard  as a grant in aid of administrative  expenses. ,As will be seen below it is proposed to  abolish theserepayments under Seotion 1*6, and it therefore becomes necessary to  make a grant for administrative exponses to theTrade Unions making these arrangements.    The amountproposed for this grant is bfo of the amount paid out  by theTrade Union  by way of State Benefit, &quot;and it is suggested thatthis  grant should be part of the general administrative expenses under the Aot,.                                          There
     There are certain provisions  in the  existing  scheme&quot; of gjj,Unemployment insurance which it  is not  proposed to continueunder the new scheme because they have  not been found to beof practical utility.     Mention need  only  be made  of  theprovisions for certain small refunds  to employers  who havekept workmen  in their employment during the  Insurance year,Certain  corresponding -refunds to workmen at  the  age of  60if they  have  received little or no unemployment  benefit,  andCertain  special provisions  for  exempting employers from thepayment  of  contributions when their workpeople are on short-time.      It  is  proposed to  discontinue the repayments under Section 105 of the National Insurance  Act,  1911, under which a subsidy out of  public  funds may  be  paid to Trade Unions paying, unemployment benefit.,  the  subsidy being  not more than one-sixth 0f the amount so paid..    The  general object of this subsidy was to give to  the uninsured trades some degree  of State assistance in respect  of Unemployment benefit corresponding to that which the Unemployment Insurance Acts gave to the insured trades,.   Having  regard  to the general  scope of the new scheme the ground  for  this subsidy obviously disappears.      As the  amount of unemployment benefit  that may be drawn is proportionate to the number of  contributions  paid by the  individual concerned, the workpeople brought  in under the new scheme will not be able  to draw any substantial  amount of benefit for a considerable  time  unless some special measures are  taken to credit  them with an Initial number of contributions free.    The need  for  some special measure of this kind will be the greater  because,  for reasons which will be explained below  there will  have  to be.an interval between the.passing of the Act, and the  date  when it comes Into &quot;force, and it is likely therefore that the  Act  will come into force sometime during the  winter  of 1980-21.  It  is proposed therefore, that the necessary provision  should bemad for enabling the new entrant &quot;to  be  entitled to a reasonable amount of benefit-shortly  after ,they begin  t0 pay contributions
     There is an accumulated fund of between  19,000,000 and 20,000/000 under the&apos;existing scheme&apos; of unemployment insurance andit Is  proposed to transfer this to the now schore without making any apportionment as between ihe old and new trades.  It is hardly possible, to take any1 other course and the proposal is fully justified on the ground&apos;that the general level of unemployment among the old trades is considerably higher than  th*t among the newtrades and as all workpeople under the general scheme will receive the same benefits in return for the same  contributions thetransfer ft he accumulated fund is reasonable as a  set off for theadvantage thus gained Sy the old trades;     It is proposed the- insert In the Bill a provision enabling one half of the railway fares to be paid out of the unemployment funds in cases where a workman on benefit is found a job a  a distance,This provision is not contained in the existing Acts but there areno$j in operation temporary, arrangements, which were begun during thewar, for payment of half fares out of public funds&apos; and the proposals is. in accordance with what- is not- infrequently done by the TradeUn i Ons in simi 1ar c ir curns tances*Special schemes for Indus trier;-.     Where it appears to the Minister of Labour that-unemployment  inany particular industry can be more properly met  by the means  of aspecial, scheme, for lhai industry than under the general Scheme aspecial scheme for the  purpose may be approved by the Minister and put Into force by means of a special order as if  enacted in the Act.&apos;formally the Initiative would be taken by-a joint industrialcouncil., or by seme other-joint Association of rCmploynps and employeewhich covers a substantial&quot;majority&quot;of the employers and workpeopleintthe   industry.-  It &quot;may be exacted that such industries asCotton wool&amp;en and mining would formulate schemes^  This coursewould In fact be taken-In well organised  Industries which have arelative^low rate of  unemployment&quot;;  or which are subject to aspecial form of unemployment (e .g v ^hort time) for v/hichappropriate provision is not&quot;made by  the  general  scheme *     Fewer would also be taken however &quot;-enabling, the minister  of-Labour &quot;to set -up a&apos; special sche-me &quot;if he thinks fit &quot;even where&quot;
the initiative in not taken by the industry.  It may be,necessary   &apos;                     .&apos; this     &apos;.for instance to oxorcise/powrr in the case&apos; of such classes astransport workers and seamen (In the case of Seamen special provision will also be made under the general scheme on the linesof that already made under the Health Insurance Scheme for use inthe event of a.special scheme not being adopted)*     i\R regards the financing ef special schemes &quot;the contributions from employers and employed will not necessarily be those made underthe general scheme but will be such as are laid down in the. special scheme and approved by the Minister as being sufficient^ and&apos;appropriate in the circumstances-.  The precise method of collectionwill also bo determined by the special scheme.     As regards the State contribution it is proposed that thefull amount of&apos;, the State contribution should be paid, into the. fund under the general scheme in respect of members under a special scheme, this State contribution being calculated as &amp;f the membersunder .the special scheme were paying the ordinary contributions under the general scheme.  ;,Thtf full amount of this State contributionwill not usually be paid over to the special scheme but only  a partof it namely 30$;(i.e*  10$ ef the assumed amount of the employers1and workmens&apos; contributions)j.the remaining 70^ of the state contribution will remain in  the general pool in aid of thepresumably higher level of unemployment under the general, schemedIn certain special cases  e.g. transport wonkers It will probeHybe necessary,to pay over the whole of the State contribution.Appropriate provision with regard to inspection and audit will,ofcourse, be necessary9     As regards transfers of Individuals between the generalscheme and the.special  scheme/
scheme * or vice versa,,or between one special scheme andanother, a s: stem of transfer values as unrier HealthInsurance is inappropriate for unemployment Insurance and isnot proposed..   The general principle will be that if an individual transfers.from a general scheme to a special schemetho general scheme will for six months continue to boresponsible for providing him with unemployment benefit.Similarly in the reverse process, tho special scheme would beresponsible for providing unemployment benefit for six monthsafter the date on which the Individual left it in order toenter the general scheme,.;   Corresponding arrangements wouldbo made as regards transfers between one special scheme andanother.   The institution of special schemes will obviouslytake a considerable time.   It is hoped to do   ;a good deal ofpropartcry  ?ork before the Act io passed, but even so, theremust be a substantial interval between the date of passing ofthe Act and. the date on which it comes Into force in order toal ow time for special schemes to be set up.   Provisionally, itis thought that this Interval will have to bo at least 6 months,although it may later on be found possible to reduce this periodsomewhat if sufficient progress has been made before thepassing of the Act.     In the original proposal there war. a provision for allowing special schemes  tc be sot up not only for an industry as a whole but for separate associations  (e.g.-, trade unions).On consideration it is thought better not to include thisproposal in the Bill because it causes,great complication andis undesirable on other grounds, particularly as it opens the door -to the entry ef industrial insurance societies Into the .field of unemployment insurance which would certainly be                                                     /strongly
EtrcTK&apos;ly resented by Tra.dc unions..                                    /IRELAND.     The proposal&quot;as regards Ireland is that the Billshould apply only to the trader, which arc already insuredagainst unerploymont under the existing Acts, but that theMinister of Labour should be empowered to extend the new scheme to other trades by administrative order.Adr.inistratlvo Expens os *     The proposals with ro?ard. to the administrative expenses under the new  scheme arc based on those relrtingto the existing scheme  of unemployment insurance.   Theseexpenses are borne in the first inctanoo by  the Treasury,which receives out of the unemployment fund  an  appropriationin aid not exceeding one-tenth of the total  receipts of thefund,
