i\L m, &apos; mo Pooment is the Property cf 308CABINET,J, \ - .; &apos;MESOPOTAMIA^ OILFIELDSMemorandum by the President of tho Board cf Trade.I share the apprehensions expressed by the First Lord of the Admiralty in his Memorandum C.P* 903 of the 18th March on this question.       It appears to me to be of tho highest importance that we should securo that the oontrol 6i the Royal Dutch Shell Croup of Companies should be in British hands, and I am not awars of any means by which this can be secured except in return for the share in the Mesopotamian Oilfields which has already been the subject of unofficial negotiations, and to a part of which they arc already entitled under the Turkish Petroleum Agreement of 1912.The proposal to develop theso oilfields as Government property may have attractions to some but the Government does not possoss the noooscary organisation for so vast a business as tho sucoossful commercial exploitation of a large oilfiold and tho marketing of its products, and I doubt if it can croato it except at groat and prohibitive expense.The recent increase in tho price of petrol and tho communications which we have had with tlio Shell and Anglo-American Companies on the subject have brought out in a most striking way our dependence on these two international groups of capitalists for what has come to bo one of the essentials of our civilisation.     I feel strongly that wo ought not to allow the opportunity to bring one of the groups under British control to be missed.I must add that, from what I know cf the past negotia-tions, I have little doubt that a failure to carry out the
provisional understanding with the Royal Dutch Shell Group may drive them into definite antagonism, and into the control oi some other country.Prom the point of view, therefore, of the Board of i&apos;rade, I join with the ilrst Lord in urging most strongly that the provisional arrangements both with the Royal Dutch Shell Group and the French Government should ho concluded without delay.16th April 1920.
