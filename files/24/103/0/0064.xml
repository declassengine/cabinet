SUGAR COMMISSION,3, Grosvenor Gardens,S.W.I.10th April, 1920.Mr. Rlackett.To the question propounded in vour Note of the 9th inst,, viz, &quot;How long in these circumstances (i.e, with&apos; an addition to our in-^bond price of fd per lb*) you can postpone a further rise of price to 1/-*&apos;; leaving yourself enough, reserve to avoid ultimate loss&quot;, the proper answer could only be &quot;Not a day&quot;.To explain this I must enter into some detail.T have for some time felt that our method of fixing a date at which our Reserve would be exhausted was dangerously liable to mislead the uninitiated;   and your question confirms that impression.What we have done has been to take the over-all costs of marketing of stocks in hand and of stocks for which contracts have actually been made, also of anticipated further purchases at current prices and current rates of exchange, against those to set the Return on Sales at the prescribed rates and the presciibed prices;   and from these factors to deduce the number of weeks for which our Reserve would suffice to cover the difference between our outgoings and our receipts.     On this basis in my Note of 5th March to the Cabinet Committee (copy enclosed) I stated thai our Reserve could be maintained until 10th November, 1920. but that that left no room for a Reserve at the close of the Commission^ operations.But now observe what has happened since.     The calculation was made &quot;on the assumption that Sugar remains at its present price f*Qrb. Cuba of 10 cents per lb,&quot; with exchange at $3,40.     So far has this assumption been falsified that the f.o.b. price Cuba is to-day 16 cents, an increase of 3d. per lb..,while
2 i) itwhile on the other hand Exchange lias advanced to nearly fA with the net result that our supplies will cost us l;*d per lb. more than we anticipated.Thus It is clear that the uncertainties of the market and of Exchange must render of little value any calculation as to the date up to which our Reserve will cover loss on sales; and further that, whether the date he earlier or later is of little moment, if no provision be made for a Reserve at the close of the Commission1s operations.What I. think will probably give the Chancellor of the Exchequer the information he ought to have will be to state the case as follows0Assume that we continue trading until 31st ;-larch, 1921, under the following conditions,(which are those now subsisting, without for the moment any definite prospect of improvement), viz,Cuban Raw Sugar (f*o.b.) 16 cents per lb.Duty 2fd. per lb.American Exchange $4.Selling Grocery Prices 10do per lb. Granulated (with Cubes 10-Jd. and Soft brown sugar 9d, )Sugar for Manufacturing Purposes - Economicprice,.Domestic ration 8 oz*Stocks and Commitments 31st March 1921, 400 G0( tons, then our accounts would show a deficit of  10,800,000.Every penny added to our selling grocery prices will increase our reserve by about  5,000,000 per annum.Thus you will see that, on the basis of existing conditions, in order to find ourselves on 31st March, 1921, with a Reserve of  10,000,000 (the very least we ought to have) we ought to lose no time In advancing grocery prices by 4d per lbo(Intlld.)-   H.W.P.10th April, 1920.
3, Grosvenor Gardens,    S.W. 5th March, 1920.)     EraaOT OF PROPOSED OHAgggS IN SUGAR PHICBS ON THS FINANCE 0? THESUGAli   COHESION i  &apos;(1) Tho Sugar Commission is prepared to provide tho Sugar re-^uired to increase the Domestic Ration from 6 oz. to 8 oz. as from 15th March.(Z) if tho retail price to the Public be raised on March 15th, from 8d to 1Q&amp;. per lb., then we could maintain a Reserve &quot;fund up to 10th November, 1920, after which we should have a deficit.(It must be remembered that in previous estimates as to date of ex-laustion of the Reserve, the Commission had already allowed in respect of j$ugar used for manufacturing purposes, for an increase In the price ibo a Level practically with cost prioe;   so that the increased return of 2d. per lb. would apply only to Grocery sugar, or about one-half of the whole jonsumption.)(3) If the retail price of sugar were further raised on (say) 1st lay to llfd. then the Reserve Fund would not be exhausted until April 1922(4) The above calculations are based on the assumption that Sugar remains at its present prioe f.o.b. Cuba of 10 cents, per lb. (which with Ixchange at $3.40 means to us  70.5 per ton).    But of course there will le variations, and the probability is in the direction of a fall, rather ban of-a rise.    Perhaps the most important factor In the problem is the iuropean production of boot, of which no estimate can yet be formed.(5) Tho leave no room for a Reserve at the clostf of the Sugar Cora-iission&apos;8 operations.    But in view of the ore sent high prices at which ho Commission must purchase, and of the fact that decontrol can hardly e contemplated until a fall in prices taxes place, the building up-of a leserve with which to meet the cost of liquidation is a necessity, if the frohequor is not to be drawn upon;   and in the opinion, of the Commission ^e amount of such Reserve should not be less than  10.000.000.ih March, 1920.
