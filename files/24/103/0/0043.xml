figg IQOuTMT IS tk6 PROPERTY OF HIS BRITMHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVBRM3NTUSECRET.CP.-1043,CABINET. BRITISH MHRS STATISTICAL QOMRBMCB. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the lExchcquor (Previous Papers :- CP, 909 ana 1004).I strongly support the views put forward by tho Minister of Health in bis memorandum CP.999 in regard to tho Report of the Statistical Conference which has been circulated to tho Cabinet by tho President of the Board of Trade (CP. 1004) and particularly in regard to,the recommendations contained in the Report relating to the suggested establishment of an Imperial Statistical Bureau-. I feol convinced that the proposals contained in the Report, have not yet been sufficiently examined and I agree With Br* Addison in thinking that the subjects dealt with ought to be thoroughly considered in detail by a small Committee of officers conversant with the work of the statistical Departments before tbo Cabinet is asked to oome to any decision.     I would suggest that the personnel of the Committee might be as followsSir Alfred Watson, Government Actuary (Chairman)*Sir J*G, Beharrell, D.S.0^, Ministry of Transport,Mr. A.W, Flux. Board,of Trade.Mr. H.7. Reade, CaB., Board of Customs and Excise.Mr. H*Rm Coates, Board of Inland Revenue.Mr. S.P. Vivian, Ministry of Health and General RegisterOffice, anda representative of the Ministry of labour.(Intld.) A.C.(treasury. S.W* April 10th. 1920.
