0Mr IDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT&quot; IS, THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIA MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.&quot;oal Government Employees and Trade Unions L.G..25.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.1, My colleagues will probably have notioed the newspaperreports of a case at the Bow County Court, where an employee of the Poplar Borough Council sued them becau30 the Council refused to extend to him a bonus which had been paid to other employees, the ground of their refusal being that he was not a member of a Trade Union.    The County Court decided against the Plaintiff, but leave to appeal was given.Numerous communications have reached me about this case, and there have been questions in the House.    As the incident is symptomatic of the attitude of several local authorities recently elected, I think it necessary to bring the whole position to the notice of the Cabinet,2* The present situation is briefly as follows(a) At the recent Local Government Elections a number of Councils were returned with a Labour majority;(b) Some of these Councils, and some Boards of Guardians, as, for example, at Poplar, have endeavoured to impose two rules upon their employees - (i)   That all applications for increases of salary are to be made through the Trade Union or Association representing the officer or workman concerned;(ii)   That increases of salary by way of far Bonus or the merging of War Bonus in salary should be conditional upon the officer or workman being a member of a Trade Union or Association, or becoming a member within a specified time,(c) The present powers of the Ministry of Health to regulate the position are as follows(i)   In the .case of Boards of Guardians the existing Orders empower the Minister to regulate the amount of salaries payable to officers, but it is doubtful whether this extends to servants and manual employees.    An amending Order under the Poor Law. Acts migtro be issued, but I am advised there is some doubt as to the feasibility of this procedure.(ii)   In the&apos; case of Local Authorities, other than Boards of Guardians, our power of control is less direct, and we could probably only review the action of the Council through our auditor who could question any item of expnediture as either &quot;unlawful or unreasonable&quot;,(d)   The action of the Poplar Board of Guardians has definitely come before the Ministry of Health for consideration and the Cabinet may wish to know the. facts, :.The/
-The Board of Gu^rdiane passed a Resolution that subject to the approval of the.Ministry of Health they proposed to merge, all existing War Bonus Into salary, but they informed their -employees that this would be conditional upon the officer or workman being a member of a Trade Union or Association, or becoming a member within a-month of the.date of the notification. The reply which *he Ministry of Health sent indicated that the Department did hot consider that the time was ripe for merging War Bonus into salaries; but that in any event, &quot;while.the Minister did not dissent from the view put forward by the Guardians of the advantages, of collective negotiations, he is definitely of opinion that a local authority should not differentiate between the lumbers of their staff upon any ground other than the services rendered tt the local authority by the several members of the staff, or-make their conditions of service depend in any way upon such a consideration as membership or non*membership of a Trade Union.lt   On receipt of this letter the Guardians, did not rescind their Resolution, Subsequently, when adopting,ihe increases under certain awards which had been made they reiterated their proviso that all future awards and increased,Of salary granted by the Board of Guardians should be conditional upon membership of a Trade Union or Association.In dealing with the issue thug, raised, it is necessary to differentiate in some resfoects between (a) the suggestion that all future applications for increases in salary shall be made through a Trade Union, and (b) the suggestion that increases of emoluments by way, e*g., of War Bonus, should be conditional upon membership of a Trade,Union.As regards1 (a), it is, I think, wrong that any man should be debarred from placing his individual claims before his employer; but I am conscious that this objection cannot be pressed far because&apos;the Government have blessed the principle of collective bargaining and Whitlay Councils have already been set up for the Civil Service and many grades of Local, Authorities employees * . .As to (b) I think the opposition must be pressed. A general bonus is made applicable to certain classes of  &apos; workers to meet the increased cost of living or otherwise to improve their position; and. then we find that a publicly elected body, because it happens to have Labour sympathies, refuses to pay that bonus to any employee who is not a Trade Unionist..   This ia. a direct infringement of the liberty of the subjeot, and.I think the Government ought to take steps to remove from any-local authority any such power of differentiation.This challenge to the individual liberty of the subject is an issue which in itself would. I think, justify the Government, taking action;    but the attitude adopted by these Labour Councils has another, and equally serious, aspect, namely,; its bearing on the attitude of permanent employees to popularly elected bodies who employ them.    If unchecked, the piicy of these Labour Councils will introduce a system wherein the conditions of employment are dependent upon the political colour of the employers, and thereby&apos;the employees, who ought to be neutral servants of any party, must be forced into the political arena.   My colleagues will, I am sure, appreciate, that there is a strong analogy between the servant of a Local Authority and the Civil Servant.&apos;    In my judgment it is essential that thery should not be. involved in political activities, and I think the need for maintaining in anyeventuality/
MINISTRY OF HEALTH. .       c addison&apos;;eventuality the essential services of the country must limit the extent to which these employees can safely be allowed to organise industrially,    The action of the Labour Councils in these cases seriously prejudices the position of both parties,;, &quot;W&amp;* For thi&apos; foregoing reasona I ask my colleagues .to.consider whether.Parliament should not be asked to take steps to remove from local authorities the power of making the discrimination which is the basis of their,action in these caseso . I am advised that it may prove&apos; difficult to draft a measure which would be effective, but I think the attempt should be made and I should be glad of a Cabinet guidance upon&apos;the.point.
