(P From Viceroy, Uth April 1920.&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Win iiih^jwiiiii&quot;.&quot;,1 ^ *&apos;(Repeated to Tehran.)(Received 16th, 2 p.m.)43&apos;7 Sf Please see Cox&apos;s telegram No. 188 of 8th April. Afghan envoy to Teheran. We have no information regarding his instructions beyond that contained in Grey&apos;s telegram No. 86 of 6th April repeated to you. Amir has recently made reconciliation between Sunni and Shiah great feature of his policy, and we have no doubt this will be main burden of Envoy&apos;s message. He will probably seek to sow suspicion between Persians and ourselves and may also represent that salvation of Persia lies in alliance with the Bolshevists as liberators of East from Western imperialism and capitalism. His policy is, however, more likely to be pan-Islamist and pro-Turk than pro-Bolshevist. We can, of course, take no exception to efforts to bring about increased friendliness between Persia and Afghanistan for so long as this does not involve unfriendliness towards ourselves.
