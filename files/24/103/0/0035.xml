ANNEX     1*SECRET.SUyPTuMMIAHY NOTE ON THE 1X13CUTT0N OF THE TREATY OF PEACE WITH TURKEY.The Greek Government has charged mo to Inform the Versailles Allied Military Committee that it is ready immediately to occupy the whole of Thrace in an effective manner with its own forces, which, moreover, it considers sufficient for the purpose.The forces in question would includej-(a) The 9th infantry division at Xanthi and in Eastern Macedonia;ft) One recently formed infantry division, (probably a marching division) constituted in Eastern Macedonia;&quot;(c) The Seres infantry division, in Eastern. Macedonia;(d) Two cavalry regiments, in Eastern Macedonia. Of these troops, the two first named divisions andthe cavalry are completely mobilised;   the Seres infantry division iB in course of mobilisation, which will be completed in ten days&apos; time.The occupation of both Eastern and Western Thrace would, of course, retain its present inter-allied character, as -was mentioned in my note of Iv!arch 19 respecting the military collaboration of Greece with a view to the execution of the Treaty with Turkey.Once the occupation has been effected, we believe that certain measures, as for instance the immediate disarmament of the Turkish population, the banishment of a few prominent persons taken as hostages, etc., would enable the Greek troops of occupation to be reduced to two divisions;   the infantry division, which would   ;^thus/
thus become available might then be sent to TreblzonA, &quot;whiobhas bean mentioned as base for the Armenian corps of occupation,     To sum up, as a preliminary to Allied action in Asia Minor, military occupation of the wholeof Thrace would offer incontestable practical advantages, and possibly also moral advantages, the Turk being, above all, a fatalist by nature.My Government further charges me to take this opportunity of stating that, if the Allies require it, itwill be possible to mobilise one or more of the four infantry divisions which are now on a poace footing (three infantry divisions - 3rd, 4th ana 14th - of the Second Army Corps, plus the Cretan division).I would finally venture to point out that, xui&amp;er the conditions set forth above, the difference/between the present Allied forces intended to operate in Turkey and those considered necessary by the French Staff at yesterday&apos;s meeting of the Allied Committee would entirely cease to exist, and this without taking into account the Armenian troops.As a reminder, I would mention that there are:-6 Greek infantry divisions at Smyrna;1 infantry division (the 8th) in Eparus, which is being maintained there;all seven mobilised.In conclusion, of the 14 infantry divisions which at ^       present compose the Greek Army, ten are at war strengthand. of that number nine are at the immediate disposal of the Allies for the execution of the Turkish Treaty.(Signed) lUCTIVAtf, Colonel.r i s.27th March, 1920.
ia Minor, soale 1:1,000,OOO0In the event of its being considered necessary to hav8 recourse to means of coercion in order to compel Turkey to accept and execute the Treaty of Peace now being prepared by the Supreme Council, Greeoe might furnish military assistance of such considerable strength that she alone would be able to impose the treaty on Turkey.     She would be all the more able to do so if operating in collaboration with her Allies.To state the matter more clearly, Greece, who at present disposes of eight infantry divisions at war strength - each numbering 15,000 men - two of which 1 are in Thrace and six in Asia Minor, could operate as follows:- .....(1) In Europe.    Greece could relieve the Allied. JVrenoh troops in the first place by replaoihg forthwith the greater part, but not the whole, of the force now ocoupyjag,; Western Thrace.Their total replacement would obviously present no difficulty;   but in view of the. lack of sufficient. ,,,. guarantees on the part of Bulgaria, the maintenance61 the present inter-alliod character of the occupation of Western Thrace would be an essential precaution.    For this same reason, it is necessary that two small English and Italian detathments should be maintained there. As a further precautionary measure     an inter-     at. allied post might be established on eaoh of tho threeprincipal/Map required: M.nor, soale 1 English edition, 1916.NOTEREGARDING THS TREATY OF PiSACS WITH TURK3Y.ICOLLABORATION    OF    GRB2CE.
principal. -frontier---passes^    (To the-^rl^^^^^ Gumu3;ina, and to the East -o^-Ortaxiof).finally, similar measures might he taken in Vfestern Thrace when the time came to impose the Treaty on Turkey; the second of the two Greek divisions might then occupy Eastern Thrace and thus release part of the Allied troops whioh are stationed there.It is of course understood that this whole extension of tho occupation of Eastern and Western Thrace could not be undertaken without previous consultation of the Greek Government. ,* -(2) In Asia Minor.    The Greek troops might co-operate here, at two distinct periods.First phase;    Apart from any inter-allied action with a view to imposing the Treaty on Turkey, it is necessary that the Greek Army in Asia Minor should be authorised to operate freely forthwith against the enemy with which it is confronted;    (20,000 to 22,000 men, 8,000 to 3,000 of whom are regular troops, and all the rest irregulars). This action would be limited to the zone defined belowOn the South, by the course of the Meander, from its mouth to its sources near Ushakton the North, by the Musluk chains (30 kilometrestEast of the head of the Bay of Adramyti, Uzunza Yaila (between the towns of Balikesri and Soma) Demirji, Simav and Jibrail;on tile Bast by the mountainous mass of the Murat Bag which stretches between the two lines described above.Within this zone and during the above-mentioned operations tho Greek G.H.Q. would have disposal of all the railways, without exception.On this oondition, and bearing in mind:(a) that the Greek forces are more than four times superior in number to the enemy forces with whioh they are confronted, and especially that   &apos;    M/
(b) their moral is quite excellent ( a largo number-oi&apos; reservists whose class had j^oa rol eased. &apos;   having asked to remain in the ranks;,it may be considered highly probable that, save forunforeseen circumstances, the Turkish forces before Smyrnawould be overwhelmed or captured.    &apos;In any case, the occu-pation within a very short period of tne upper valley of theHermos would he absolutely certain.     Even supposing thatthe enemy withdrew unscathed to his base, the Entente couldderive great profit from this operation;   as a matter of fact,this set-back of the Turkish  drees on the Smyrna frontwould immediately divert to the upper valley of the Hermosall the available Turkish troops within suitable distance(for instance in the region of Ismit, Angora and Zonia). -In this wav, the Entente might occupy more easily than if theoperation in question hud not taken place, certain strategicalpoints, as for instance the region extending- along theIsmit-Afium-K&amp;rahissar-Halep line, and the Sski-shehr-Angorahranch line.But in regard to this, we must now discuss the second phase of Greek collaboration.Second -chase:-    After havinsr occupied the zone ex-,       -.......- - -...... -....... --tending as far as the mountain block of the Murat Dag, the Greek Army in Asia Minor, starting from this region (in particular Balikesri and Ushak) raipht occupy:-(a) with one division, the region extending betweenthe peninsulas of Bithynia and Troas (N. iff.part of the&apos; vilayet of Broussa) in order thus to be able, if necessary, rapidly to link up with the two divisions which will be in Thrace and one of which, as has been said, will occupy Eastern Thrace;(b) with four divisions (one infantry division remainingat Smyrna itself) the district surrounding Afriun-Karahissar, so as to join up from thence with the Allied troops both on the north and south, starting from Ismit or Adana-Konia (Franco-British^
British-1 tali an troops) the number&quot; oi Vhxcl .v, ooli yvu may he estimated at about 60,000 men.With regard to this latter operation it may be noted that the material and moral conditions of the two opposing forces can be summarised as follows(1) the present total strength of the Turkish regular and irregular forces in Asia Minor (both on the Smyrna and Armenian fronts) is 60,000 men, according to information obtained by the Greet Government.The Allied strength in Asia Minor nan easily.be brought up to 150,000 men.     On the other hand, the enemy war material is very limited and cannot of course be replaced; that of the Allies is inexhaustible.(2) The Allied forces, who are in possession of the railheads of all the railways, can operate towards Afriun-Kara his sax concentrically and sifaultanecusly   co-ordinating their efforts;   in the case of the enemy, on the contrary, such action is impossible-     In the first 7lace. the forces in Thrace cannot pass over into Asia; and secondly, SO,000 men on the Armenian front cannot take part in the principal action, since the distance  rom Jteaermo to Afriun-Karahissar ; is more than 1,000 kilometres, which would necessitate a march of two or three months.It may further be noted that it is improbable that eventhe enemy forces in Cilicia can return noftliwards, since they would than leave the road open to the Army of the Levantand would thus be caugut between two fires, apart from thebarrier to their advance which might be formed by the italian troops at Konia.     To sum up, more than 100,000 organisedAllied troops would be -opposed, to 20,000 or 25,000 NationalistTurkish troops, lacking every necessary.I_(5)/ &apos; \
iZ) Last point;   any new attempt at mobiliaatij&amp;o ry .he Turkish troops: on tho Smyrna front is doomed in advance to oomplote failure.As a matter of fact, so much information has been collected near tho Smyrna zone of occupation - not mere indications but tangible proofs - as to the desperately low moral of the Turkish population ana its effect on the troops already mobilised by Mustafa Kemal, that no anxiety can continue to exist on this head.On the contrary, there is   nothing to prevent the recall to the colours of several young Greek classes, who are at present on unlimited leave ana whose moral, as already mentioned, is beycnd praise.With this divergence of material and moral conditions, the occupation by the Allied troops of the whole of Western Asia Minor ana of a considerable part of Central Asia Minor, which, as is well known, comprises the richest provinces of the future Turkish State, will be effected with the greatest ease, but at the same time the Entente will thereby have secured the necessary pledge to enable her to impose the Treaty of Peace on Turkey.(Signed) BACTIVAH , Colonel.Paris.19th March, 1920.

The occupation of Kurdistan is not mentioned, no decision having been communicated,to the V.A.M.C with re-gard to the future status of that country.   Furthermore, neither Syria proper, Palestine, nor Arabia have been men-tloned, the execution of the Treaty of Peace with regard thereto having apparently been dealt with elsewhere.

It will, therefore, be indispensable:^5)(a) To give her immediately the assistance      of an Allied force capable of enforcing evacuation by the Turks.   In view of the size of&apos;this territory and.of its hilly nature, and of the work to be undertaken for the purpose of assuring communications, this force should be estimated at a minimum figure of 4 infantry divisions.(b) To furnish her as quickly as possible with the1).Material not taken away; belonging to the principal Turkish armies which opposed the Russian Army of the Caucasus in this regions2), 1(3;000 men, inruffIciently armed and without material, 3).

means of organising and developing her own forces (instruc-tors) armament and war material).In order to assure the transport of the Allied forces to Armenia, as well of the supplies of foodstuffs and material required by them and by the Armenian troops, a base should be creoted (a) at the port of Trebizond, which gives access to the Erzerum district, and (b) at the port of Ba turn end, in Georgia, in order to hawe the use of the Batum-Tiflis-Erzerum railroad.An agreement as to the use of these bases and communi-cations should first be made with Georgia-.To sum up. the forces required to assure the taking possession cf the territory to be ceded by Turkey or to be neutralised, can be reckoned as follows?.-Thrace   ......,* t . *......      4 infantry divjU Ul CllViJ t  (  i t  (  i   t  i&apos;  (  i  t  &quot;  t  t I   &apos;  I M /oSmyrna ------.     3        &quot;        &quot;Northern frontier of Syria 4 &quot; &quot; Mesopotamia ............     2        ,f        &quot;Armenia .....4        &quot;_&quot;Total:-     19 infantry div:II.Even if possession is taken as indicated above, this will be insVvfficiont to render the enemy powerless..

Its communica-tions would be wKh Alexandretta or Kerslna,2)-The Naval representation *es have advised against block-ade of the coast of Asia Minor, as it would be Ineffective, difficult to carry out owing to the length of coast-line, and liable to aggravate the uncertain state of affairs already prevailing with regard to provisioning1 Constantinople.3),The Italian representative pointed out that it would be wise to consider a reserve of about 4 I.Dsj, which would if necessity arose, give the strength necessary to break an enemy attack in force on any part of the vast front occupied by the Allies *Taking the above remark into account, the total Allied forces to be provided would thus amount to about 30 diTii&amp;onf,would find it difficult to exist and to move,.  Tho end in view might be more usefully assisted by a strongly senured&apos;hold on vital portions of the Ottoman Empire, in order to deprive the enemy of hi8 contingents and their material resources and communloations.Occupation of the region bounded on the east by the Haldar-Pasha-Alexandretta line, and perhaps of the Angora railway, would answer this purpose.   The following forces would be required, viz:-
&apos;     &quot;.6. &apos;nr.(a) Taking, possession xf the ^errm.tory ref^erred to and disarmament of the enemy could he undertaker, success sively or simultaneously * -The first of these alternatives would present serious drawbacks, such as leaving liberty of action to the enemy,, and allowing the possibility of fresh massacres by him among non-Moslem populations-It would also have the effect of prolonging the^duration of Allied intervention, as transport of troops from&apos; one theatre of operations to another would necessarily involve great delay, owing to distance and to the slowness of communications.It wculd; therefore, appear desirable for operations to be as ranch as possible undertaken simu1taneously in the variousf zones and for preparations, to be proceeded with at once, in order that the Allies might be able to act immediately and profit by favourable weather, should the Turkish Government refuse to sign,, ratify, or carry out the Treaty.(b) To organise and carry out these operations me-thodically, it would further be desirable:** To place aM Allied troops operating in European Turkey under one particular command;To place under one general command all Allied troops required to operate concentrically from the Eosphorus to the ffiaurus.The forces for Syria-Cilicia, Mesopotamia and Armenia should, by reason of their special tasks, have a separate command, whilst co-operating generally with the troops in Asia Minor when these shall be within their particular zone,Finally, the Supreme Council of the various Govern-ments should create a High Command, in order to co-ordinate action undertaken in theatres of operation which will be-many and varied.
In order to carry out the programme set forth above, the Allies now have the following forces on the spot, viz,*-Prench forces .,. 5 ; Incomplete I.Ds,(including Syria-cilicia).British forces.    4 &quot;        n   fl (     &quot; Mesopotamia).Italian forces I.D.Greek forces     ... 9^&quot; &quot; (6 in Smyrna; 3 in Europe),Total    TSTY*T)s^ of which W would have to bebrought to full strengx-hoSome 27 divisions are required to carry out this pro-gramme, which would mean the addition of a further 8 infantry divisions,In the present circumstances, neither Prance, Great Britain, nor Italy can he asked to provide these reinforcements0Greece could cily do so in part., by putting into the line all available troops from the Interior, which would have to be mobilised afresh (i*o,, 5 IJ)S&apos;)0It should be pointed out that Greek effectives already represent about half of the Allied forces now available in Turkish territory, both in Europe and in Asia.,?More extensive use of the Greek army in operations against Turkey would, moreover, probably incense the nationalist and anti-foreign feelings of the Turks and give to the struggle such a desperate character as would greatly increase its difficulties.)If the Entente confined itself to the exclusive use of its available forces (19 IuDs) it would, therefore, have to limit itself to the partial execution of the pro-gramme under contemplation, i!?e.:-Maintaining find consolidating such occupation as has already been carried out;Taking possession of territory which is to be nou-tralised or to be ceded by&apos;Turkey in Europe or in Vastern Asia Minor;
Seizing the system of communications of this latter portion of the Ottoman Empire.In these circumstances,. however; the position of Armenia would not bo settled, nor yet the clauses reducing Turkey to powerlessness from the military point of view,, as that State would still be able to occupy Armenia and to recruit and feed its forces, as well as to oppress minorities, in all the central and eastern portions of Asia Minor..This Is as much as to say that execution of the Treaty cannot be assured in Its entirety     and more especially in eastern Turkey in Asia - without the Intervention of Allied forces in greater strength than that at present available, and which the United States of America would if necessary be asked to supply...Great Britain..

If enforced in certain important but entirely Moslem centres, for instance, It would.in fact run the risk of being In opposition to the fundamental principle of recruiting set forth above;   the tendency of this principle is, on the contrary., to make the composition of the gendarmerie and police correspond to *.he ethnical and religious conditions of each region oridistrict.As a result of the preceding remarks;*   (1) Article 15 should be completed by the following paragraph:-&quot;The provisions of the two preceding -&quot;ing paragraphs apply both to the re-&quot;cruiting and distribution of the senior &quot;and junior cadres and to the recruit-&quot;ing and distribution of the men&quot;.(2) Chapter V, Article 20. should be altered as follows:-Title: Instead of Customs Officials, local Police&quot;, read&quot;Customs Officials, local urban and rural Police, Forest Guards&quot;.Article 20:   add a fourth paragraphworded
wordad as follows: -

"In each administrative district " the local ?arbar police and rural and 

"forest guards shall be ?ecruited, "officered and distributed according to "the principles laid down 1.1 the case "of the gendarmerie in Article 15 "(second, third and fourth paragraphs)".

Provisions relating to the Islands in the AEgean.

Proposals contained in Letter A.J.63 of March 4 from British Secretary if Supreme Council.

On February 21, 1920, the Supreme Council approved  the demilitarisation of the islands of Lemnos, Imbros, Samothrace, Tenedos and Mitylene and of the islands in the Sea of armara.

It appears desirable that the islands mentioned above should include the Island of ?luskonisi and the unnamed  islets adjacent to the islands in the AEgean referred to above. 

OPINION of the Military and Naval Representatives.

The islets adjacent to the Isalnds of Lemnos, Imbros, Samothrace, Tenedos and Mitylene are of no interest from the naval and military point of view.

There is no objection to the demilitarisation of the Island of Muskonisi, provided the line marking the southern limit of the demilitarised zone in the Straits be extended along the southern coast of the Gulf of Adramyti as far as the western extremity of the peninsula,of Tuz-Burnu.




articles 1. 8 and 22 o 27 of the Draft prepared by the Corn-it tee for the Ad-linlstratlon of aterways, the Straits. Stfid the Sea of Marmara.OPINION  of the Military and Naval Repree ratatives.The Naval Representatives, after discussion of the articles referred to In the margin, have unanimously expressed, the following opin5oas, with wto,ich the Military Representatives asstoiate them-selvesj-*DRAFT REGULATIONS FOR THE STRAITS.It is impossible for the Naval &apos; advisers to agree and to express an opinion on the proposed regulation until they are aware of what is understood by &quot;freedom of the Straits&quot;*Does this mean freedom of navigation for warships and merchant vessels both in war-time and in time of peace, without distinction of nationality?If so5 the text submitted entails numerous restrictions of that freedom, the object and limits of which it would    i appear necessary to define.Commi ssion.   It would seem that the ordinary role of the Commission is not consistent with its title of High Corn-mission&quot; and the power given it by Article 8 of requisitioning the assistance of naval and military forces0The most logical form of organisation would probably be to have High Commissioners(who

Venizelos* memor-andum of March 8 are open to certain objections.
