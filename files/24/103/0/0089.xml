The Cabinet will remember that while the Act of 1915 as amended and modified by the Act of April 1919 remains in force until: Lady Oay 1921, the Act of December 1919 which repealed the provisions of the earlier Acts as to Orders for possession and substituted new provisions remains in force only until 1st July next.    Such legislation as may be nCoessary-&apos; must therefore be passed before the end Af June0on pages 13 and 14 of the Report/ a copy of which is attached to this memorandum.trlcticn Acts should be continued for a further period of three years, subject however to an increase inrentsshould be made in two stages *    They recommend an immediate increase of 30$ on the pre-war rent exclusive of ratesc -  It is calculated that an Increase of 30$ on the rent exclusive of rates is equivalent to 22$ of tne &quot;standard rent&apos;1 where the landlord .pays the rates. fho gcmmittee propose a further increase of another 10$ on the pre-war rent exclusive of rates in 12 months time, making a total Increase of 40$ on the irent exclusive of rates or 29$ on the standard rentoThe Committee !s recommendations are summarised the Committee recommend that the Rent. Res-and rates of mortgage interest;..The Committee propose that these increases
In the case of mortgage interest the Committee propose an immediate increase of ifl on the pre-war rate and a further increase of      dm a year1 s time;.The first ojaostion^ upon which it is necessary to obtain a Cabinet direction is the amount of the increase in rent to be permitted.The Committee point,out that the cost of re- -pairs has&apos; increased by 2f times the pre-war cost and the immediate increase in rent which they propose is only sufficient to cover the Increased cost of repairs and other outgoings, together with the permitted increase in mortgage interest.    The increase in rent recommended is to bo conditionsl upon the repairs being actually executed, the landlord being given a limited time within which to carry out the work.It appears to me that the Increases proposed by the Committee are amply justified toy the increased cost of repairs, etc and that any lesser increases would be prejudicial to housing.    As I pointed out in the Memorandum which I submitted to the Cabinet before the Committee was set up, the existing res-trictlons on house rer*t operate adversely upon the general housing question (l) by discouraging private enterprise in house building, (2) by keeping down the general level of rents and thereby increasing the deficit of the State assisted housing schemes, and (3) by making it difficult for house owners to execute necessary repairs At the same time I recognise that If the increases proposed by the Committee are accepted there is a danger that they will be followed by a widespread demand for increases in the rates of wages. The Cabinet should note that Mr-. Hallas, M.P., the nominee of the Labour Party on the Committee,, has signed the Report subject to a reservation in regard to the amount of the increases.    He proposes that the
total Increase on pre-war net rent should not exceed 30$ and that this increase should be made in three equal stages.Tho geeend question upon which a cabinet direction is needed relates to the proposal of the Committee to ex-tend the Acts to houses of a higher rental than those which are now protected.     The Committee suggest that ,the Acts should be extended to dwelling houses where the standard rent does not exceed in London  105, in Scotland  90 and elsewhere &amp;7S, thus trebling the limits pres-cribed by the original Act which were doubled by the Act of April, 1919,    The Committee appear to recognise that there is no logical justification for fixing the limits at the precise figures suggested by them.   But the same criticism may be made in regard to the limits taken under the earlier Acts *    I have no doubt that in whatever form the Bill be introduced many amendments on this point will be moved *    But unless a strong feeling is expressed in Parliament I should propose to accept the recommenda-tions of the Committee on this point.A third question which arises is that related to the possible extension of the Acts to business premises. The Committee devoted much attention to this subject.   In the end, while expressing the fullest sympathy with the grievances of tenants of business premises and recording their opinion that steps should be taken to check profiteering in such premises, the Committee came to the,.conclusion that tlje provisions of the Rent Restriction Acts were unsuited to this class of property and that the issues raised fall within the scope of a measure of a different type,    I understand that the Committee had In mind a measure on the ljnes of the Landlord and Tenant Bill which was drafted on my instruct ions, when I was Minister of Reconstruction and of the Town Tenants bill &apos;e
which has been introduced on various occasions by private members.    The tiommlttee quote the evidence they received from witnesses representing the Town Tenants League to the effect that although the War had accentuated their grievances, these grievances arose prior to the War and could not be removed by the mere application of the Rent Restriction Acts to business premises.    Theso witnesses are quoted as stating that suoh a remedy would only deal with the fringe of a vast problem and would nSt satisfy their demands in respect of continuity of tenure and compensation for improvement which add to the letting value of the holding and compensation for disturbance.I understand that Lord Salisbury personally took strong exception to the proposal that the Acts should be extended to business premises and I have -no doubt that if the Government were to override the recommendations of his Committee on this subject he would offer strenuous opposition when the Bill came before the Houso of Lords. The difficulties of extending the Acts to property of this class would, undoubtedly be very great.     If the protection af afforded by the A0ts were limited to business premises of the same rental as dwelling houses which are protected the -igrievances of tenants of business premises of higher rentals would still remain a - On the other hand I oannni) suppose that the Cabinet or Parliament would agree to extend the protection of the Rent Restriction Acts to the tenants of highly rented properties, in the City of London and other . commercial centres.. Further, the long-standing grievances of which bodies such as the Town Tenants League complain would remain unremedied* 1 gi^d^sposed therefore to,,,suggost for the consideration of the Cabinet that the Landlord and Tenant Bill might be revived and perhaps referred to a Select Committee which would seem to

I must, however* stipulate.that If such a course be taken a Bill of such a nature should be placed in the charge of the Law Officers and not of the Minister of Health.I do not think It is necessary at this stage to trouble tho Cabinet with the minor modifications of the Acts recommended by the Committee.    They appear to me to be useful suggestions and well designed to remove difficulties which have been experienced in the operation of the existing Acts.

A Committee was appointed by the Minister of Transport to consider and repor to him upon the question of the taxation of, and regulations affecting, Road Vehicles. The Committee was constituted as follows: Sir Henry Maybury,K.C.M.G.,,C.B.  Director-General of Roads, Ministry ofTransport (Chairman).Sir George Beharrell, D.S.O.    - Director-General of Finance and Statistics,Ministry of Transport.Sir Philip Nash, K.C.M.G., C.B.  -  Director-General of Traffic, Ministry ofTransport.Sir Thomas Berridoe, K.B.E.      - Royal Automobile Club.Mr. E.

Elliott, C.B. -  Police Authorities.Mr. C. W. Tindall -        -  Agriculture.Sir Harcourt Clare        -        -  Local Authorities.Mr. F. Pick        .... London and Provincial Omnibus Owners&apos;Association.Mr. W. Rees Jeffreys     -        -  Society  of  Motor  Manufacturers   and traders.Mr. W. H. Pascoe -        -        -  Board of Customs and Excise. Mr. j. S. Williams -        -        -  Treasury.Mr. J. S. Pool Godsell, M.B.E., Secretary.The terms of reference were as follows :To enquire into and report as to the following matters in relation to the Regulation and Taxation of Road Vehicles.(1) Taxation and Revenue, including an expression of opinion as to the effect of the removal of the existing motor spirit duty on the price of petrol. (2) Registration and Licensing. (3) Design, construction and weight. (4) Identification. (5) Speed limits. (6) Roads:(a) The effect of self-propelled traffic.(b) The question of safety of other traffic.(c) Application of section 20, Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916.An interim majority report, signed by 12 out of the 13 members, together with certain reservations, is set out in Appendix I.A minority report by the remaining member is set out in Appendix II.It will be observed from the majority report that the broad principles of the Committee&apos;s proposals are as follows : (i) Abolition of the motor spirit duty.(ii) A new method of assessing the licence duty to be paid on mechanically propelled vehicles, viz. : (a) Motor cycles according to category.(b) Private motor cars on horse-power.(c) Commercial goods vehicles on unladen weight.(d) Hackney vehicles on seating capacity.(e) Other commercial and agricultural vehicles on unladen weight.If a true comparison is to be drawn between the effects of the proposed and the existing methods of taxation both these principles must be borne in mind.In the case of all motor vehicles, except those of private owners, the licence duty has hitherto been either nominal or non-existent.As the average consumption of petrol remains fairly constant, and accurate accounts are kept by the proprietors, no difficulty should arise in working out the saving that would be effected by the abolition of the Motor Spirit duty and comparing this with the amount of the licence duty proposed to be imposed.
The case of privately-owned motor cars is different. The licence duty has been substantial, and as it is direct there is a tendency on the part of the owners to regard it as the only duty, and to over-look the amount paid indirectly on the petrol consumed. Hence the obvious comparison drawn will be between the existing and proposed licence duties, which appear to show a very large increase in the case of private cars. Bat this is fallacious, and in order to arrive at a proper comparison it is necessary to add to the existing licence duty the amount of duty paid on the petrol consumed (namely Qd. per gallon), and to set off against the proposed licence duties the saving that will be effected by the decrease of 7d. per gallon in the price of petrol consequent upon the abolition of the tax.In order as far as possible to show the real effect of the proposed change in the case of private motor cars, a comparative table has been prepared by the Ministry of Transport, and is set out in Appendix III.APPENDIX I.DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON THE TAXATION AND REGULATION OF ROAD VEHICLES.INTERIM REPORT.AS TO TAXATION AND REVENUE.To the Right Honourable Sir Eric C. Geddes, G.C.B., G.B.E., M.P., Ministerof Transport.Sir,I. Arrangement of Report. The Committee have now completed their investiga-tions concerning the taxation of road vehicles, and have the honour to present this Interim Report, containing their conclusions and recommendations. The Report consists of three parts and au Appendix. Part I., &quot; General Principles,&quot; contains the general views of the Committee upon this question of taxation. Part II., &quot; Details of Proposals,&quot; deals with the basis and details of the Committee&apos;s proposals and the manner in which they recommend they should be carried into effect. Part III, V Scale of Duties,&quot; shows the rates of new licence duties recommended. TheAppendix consists of a Budget showing the estimated receipts from the new duties, and the estimated immediate requirements of the Ministry of Transport for road purposes.Part I. General Principles.2. Object to be attained. The problem before the Committee was the raising of an annual net revenue, provisionally estimated at 7,000,0001., which, after payment of the contemplated contributions by the Central Government towards the maintenance of the first and second class roads, would still leave in the hands of the Ministry of Transport a sufficient sum to enable a substantial measure of new road construction and road improvement to be undertaken forthwith.3. Revenue to be derived from Road Vehicles. This revenue was to be raised by taxation, direct or indirect, of road vehicles, and in particular of motor vehicles. Having regard to the bad state into which many roads have fallen during five years of war, and to the gain which must accrue to users of the roads if they are restored speedily, represented by a reduced cost of maintenace and a lessened wear of tyres, there is considerable inducement to such users to accept this in principle, especially as the Chancellor of the Exchequer finds himself at present unable to provide the money out of any other source of revenue. If roads are to be repaired and improved the users of the roads will have to make a large contribution. This was stated to be the position. It was also stated that the Chancellor considered that the Petrol Tax was not a satisfactory means of providing the revenue required.4. The Committee recognise that in view of the financial needs of the country they cannot but acquiesce in the view expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, although contrary to the true opinion of many of the members. These members think, that having regard to the importance of cheap transport facilities to the prosperous economic life of the people, it is unsound in principle to place any special tax upon transport agencies which in the nature of things must largely be passedu (37)10654 wt 870  g 33  3000  4/20 a 2
forward in higher rates of fare or charge. While, therefore, they realise the necessity for such a tax at this time to meet these urgent needs, they look forward to,, an opportunity of re-opening the whole question when conditions shall have improved. The Committee recommend that the whole question of the incidence of taxation in relation to transport facilities shall be reconsidered from the widest aspect at an early date. In this connection, the Committee would refer to the recommendations eon-tained in paragraph 6 of the Report of the Departmental Committee on Road Locomotives and Heavy Motor Cars (Cd. 5 of .1.918) that the increased cost of improving and maintaining roads should be equitably adjusted between the local rates, the National Exchequer, and. the users of the roads.5. Regard for the financial needs of the country similarly prevented the con-templation of any remission of existing taxation. On the contrary, the depreciated value of money, or conversely the enhanced expenditure on roads, called for additional taxation.6. Exchequer Grants. The Departmental Committee on Local Taxation, in their Report (Cd. 7315 of 1914) in proposing to abolish the assigned revenues system, recommended in effect (paragraph 156) that in lieu of the balance remaining available from the Exchequer contributions for highway purposes, Exchequer grants should be given in respect of first and second class roads. This recom-mendation only emphasises and confirms the principle adopted in the final Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation (Cd. 638 of 1901, page 29), to which the Government was intending to give effect by means of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1914 (Bill 251), which was only withdrawn by reason of the war. In a House of Commons paper (212/1914), (&quot; Statements explaining the Proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Financial Statement on Monday, May 4th, 1914,&quot;) the amount of the proposed Exchequer Grants in the first complete year, 1915-16, to roads in England and Wales, was estimated by the Treasury at 2,480,000/. If that Bill had become law, the contribution from the National Exchequer, without additional motor taxation, would now have been in excess of 5,000,000L per annum.Under the proposals now recommended the whole of the increased contributions towards roads will be borne by the owners of mechanically-propelled vehicles, and not by grants from the Exchequer. The Committee desire to emphasise the fact that they consider this should only be regarded as a temporary arrangement due to immediate-necessity to provide monies for roads and to the existing financial conditions, and that at the earliest opportunity the Exchequer should provide out of general funds a fair and just proportion of highway expenses, whether under the assigned revenues system or under any modification of such system that may be adopted by the Legislature in the future.7. The charges, imperial and local, on motor vehicles are various. There are registration fees, licence duties on motor cars and special licence duties for hackney carriages, as well as other special fees for road locomotives. In addition, and constituting the principal source of revenue, there is the motor spirit duty levied on imported petrol.8. Objections to Motor Spirit Duty. The burden of this report turns upon the retention of this motor spirit duty or the substitution of some alternative means of taxation for it. The Committee have had the advantage of learning from the Customs Authorities the practical and growing difficulties connected with the collection of this duty and the allowance of rebates.   These appear to fall under three heads : -(a) Practical Operation, by reason of the difficulty of collection occasioned by the system of rebates.(b) Principle, by reason of its failure to cover all liquid fuels used for mechanical traction..(c) Scope, by reason of its application to imported fuel only. .      .     ....9. The Committee were predisposed to the opinion that these defects might have been largely remedied by the withdrawal of rebates in favour of a flat rate of motor spirit duty with a revised schedule of licence duties, by the establishment of special surcharge licence duties for those forms of mechanical traction, not dependent upon petrol, and by the reimposition of an excise duty ori home produced fuel.      1  :   .   ;10. The Committee realise, however, that the objections in principle to the continuation of the petrol tax will rapidly grow more apparent, and although there
is not general agreement by all the members of the Committee that the practical difficulties are such as&apos;to justify the immediate withdrawal of the tax, yet there is general agreement that the time will come, at no distant date, when it will be a physical impossibility to impose a tax upon motor spirit used for internal combustion engines which is not also applicable to a variety of industrial and domestic purposes. The evidence of the Deputy Government Chemist, with which independent expert opinion was in agreement, appeared conclusive upon this point. The Committee have been advised that the consideration of the only alternative open to them in this connection, namely the imposition of a graduated duty upon all imported hydro-carbons and carbohydrates, is not within the scope of their reference.11. Effect on Price of Withdrawal of Motor Spirit Duly. The Committee have&apos; considered what effect the withdrawal of the motor spirit duty would have on the price to be charged by the supplier to the user. The Chairman having consulted the Petrol Companies, has an assurance from them that if the duty of 6cZ. be taken off they will immediately reduce the price to the public by Id., the additional Id. representing consequential savings resulting to the suppliers. There is, however, no guarantee that the price would not speedily rise again. In this event, the substitution of alternative means of taxation would have the appearance of an additional burden upon petrol users, but it is submitted that this would be appearance only, for the real cause of the rise in price could not be other than a corresponding rise in the wholesale price, or in the cost of freightage and distribution, all of which include profits. The petrol duty is not in itself a determining factor, except in so far as its inclusion in the price results in additional interest and commission charges which the suppliers pass on to the consumers. The duty is levied per gallon, and the commodity is bought per gallon, so that there is no adjustment of duty to be made.The price of petrol to-day is governed solely by demand, which has outrun supplies. The market is a closed one in that there is an absence of effective coin-petition. The effect of competition would not, however, be to make the suppliers pay the duty, but could only be to induce the suppliers to take a lower rate of profit.For the reasons stated above and elsewhere in this Report, the Committee regret that they are in disagreement with the following extract from the Report of the Central Committee on Motor Fuel under the Profiteering Act, 1919 (Cd. 597): &quot; We have considered the effect of the present import duty upon the price of petrol, and we are of opinion that, under existing circumstances, users of petrol in this country would not be likely to obtain the full benefit of a remission or reduction of this duty. So long as any special taxation is thought necessary in the case of motor cars we consider a tax on motor fuel to be more equitable than a tax on cars.&quot;12. At the same time, the Committee feel it incumbent upon them expressly to record their view that the adoption of a substituted means of taxation for the motor spirit duty should be concurrent with the adoption of State policy with regard to petrol supplies first, and petrol prices second, Avhich will secure to users petrol in adequate quantities on the most favourable terms possible in relation to current world price, controlling all such elements in the price as come within the range of Government action. They recognise that the price of petrol is not susceptible to complete control by any Government Authority, and think that the most ready means to ensure a satisfactory fuel position would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage in every practical manner the production and use of alternative motor fuels, and the development of home and empire produced petrol, benzole, and power alcohol. Unless such action be taken forthwith they fear that the combined effect of additional taxation and rising prices of motor spirit will impose so great a burden on mechanical road transport that it will have a most serious effect on the industry, restricting its usefulness by increasing still further the cost of transport and agricultural operations.13. Reasons for Committee&apos;s Recommendations. It is only proper to state that a majority of members of the Committee approached the inquiry with a belief that a system of motor fuel duties would prove to be the only fair one by reason of its being an approximate measure of the user of the road by any motor vehicle, but as investi-gation proceeded most of the members representative of motor interests were gradually  if reluctantly-^convinced that the anomalies under any such system of duties must, in the near future, become more numerous and serious than any which are anticipatedu  10664 B
Category. Horse Power.Passenger Seating capacity. Unladen Weight.under a single tax system based on the vehicle, such as is recommended in para-graph 17.14. The principal advantages of a system of motor fuel duties are that the charge (a.) is approximately proportionate to the user of the motor vehicle consuming dutiable fuel, (b) is payable by small instalments, and (c) affords protection to home produced motor fuels. Its obvious disadvantages are (a) that users for traction purposes of paraffin, benzole, shale spirit, gas and other substitutes escape taxation, (6) that fraudulent practices over rebates are difficult to detect, and (c) that the Road Fund is inevitably deprived of an increasing proportion of income that should accrue.15. The principal advantages of a single tax system based upon an agreed classi-fication of mechanically-propelled vehicles are that it is (a) clear in its incidence, (6) applicable to all types of vehicle, and (c) difficult of evasion. The obvious disad-vantage is that the lower the annual mileage, the more the taxation cost per mile, but a scheme of quarterly licences has been devised which will largely meet this objection where seasonal causes govern the mileage run.1C. The Committee considered numerous other suggested bases of taxation. The only one which showed any prospect of providing a possible solution was a tax on tyres. After careful investigation they were forced to the conclusion that such a tax was impracticable, and that a single tax based on the vehicle is the only feasible alternative to a motor fuel tax.17. Vehicle Duty adopted. The Committee accordingly recommend the adoption of a single tax based on the vehicle in accordance with the scale of duties set out in Part III.18. Bases of Assessment of Vehicles to Duty--The rates of duty shown as applic-able to the various types of vehicle are considered to represent as fair a division of the burden as the Committee can devise. Any departure from the general level of rates for one class or type would necessarily involve corresponding adjustments in the rates for other classes or types. It will be observed that the main features on which the duty is based are as follows : Vehicles. Basis of Assessment.(a) Motor Cycles &amp;c.(b) Private Motor Cars(c) Hackney Motor Vehicles(d) Commercial Goods Vehicles19. The Committee have adopted three categories of motor cycles, with a maximum unladen weight limit of 7 cwt., and have placed the respective duties at the lowest annual rates of duty that appeared feasible in view of the difficulties of making provision for the issue of quarterly licences for motor cycles.20. With regard to the horse power basis for private cars, the Committee do not recommend any alteration in the existing Treasury (R.A.C.) rating, but it will be observed that the scale now proposed is much more finely graduated than that at present in force. Having regard to the refund hereinafter recommended (paragraph 25) in respect of old engines, and the proposals to issue quarterly licences and to permit licences to be transferred with the vehicle, it is considered that this scale is as equitable a one as the Committee,can devise.21. In the case of hackney vehicles, it is felt that seating accommodation provides a fair basis for taxation. In this connection it must be also borne in mind &apos; that two scales are recommended, one for thickly populated districts where a heavier passenger traffic and a more frequent use cf the vehicle exist, and the other for less densely populated areas. -22. As to commercial goods vehicles, unladen weight is the fairest indication of load capacity and consequent demands upon the roads, and such vehicles are, therefore, more highly rated per ton than if the basis were declared or estimated total weight of the vehicle and its load.23. Rebates. -Careful consideration has been given to a number of suggestions and applications that have been made with regard to rebates to certain classes of user, similar in character to the rebate now granted to Medical Practitioners. These included not only Medical Practitioners and Veterinary Surgeons, but Clergymen, Road Surveyors,
Commercial Travellers, and Relieving Officers. The Committee are unable to recommend any such rebates, and consider the principle involved an undesirable one. The real ground of these applications is, that the cars are used for professional or business purposes, and admittedly they are so used extensively. When owners of commercial vehicles were entitled to a rebate from the petrol duty, there were grounds for considering rebates for those owners of private motor cars which were largely used for professional and business purposes. Now that the principle of rebate has been abandoned by the Committee in respect of commercial vehicles, no argument can be advanced for continuing rebates in respect of particular classes of private motor cars, nor, under the scale of duties set out in Part III., would the transference of such private motor cars to the commercial class ordinarily afford any advantage to their owners.24. While the Committee are opposed in principle to rebates, there is one case, namely that of private cars, the engines of which were constructed prior to 1013, for which they recommend an allowance of 25 per cent. The rating of those engines according to the Treasury (R. A. C.) formula is considerably higher than that of a modern car developing the same horse power and the tax would, therefore, be correspondingly high. This concession is considered expedient in order not to hamper the continued use of cars of obsolete types at a time when the supply of new cars is not equal to the demand.25. Bases of the proposed Duties. The Committee, in recommending the single tax system as the alternative to a fuel tax, consider that (a) the entire proceeds (less the costs of levying and collecting) should be devoted to maintenance, improvement and construction of roads and bridges;(/;) it should be the sole tax or levy for imperial or local purposes to be imposed on the use of mechanically-propelled road vehicles.,As to (a), they received the assurance of their Chairman that this is in accordance with the policy of the Government, except as regards the payment of the.COO,O0OL now guaranteed annually to the local authorities in lieu of the proceeds of the carriage licence duties in the standard year (1908-9). The Committee feel that this sum of 600,600L, which is paid to the local authorities not for roads but for general purposes, ought not to be borne by the Road Fund if it can be provided from any other source. If it is not possible to do this at present, they recommend that the matter should be adjusted, without prejudice to the local authorities, on the next occasion when the Imperial subventions to these authorities are revised.With regard to (ft), the Committee assume that the tax on fuel used by mechanically-propelled vehicles will be abolished, and they recommend that in respect of such vehicles all payments to local or police authorities for registration or for licensing as hackney vehicles should be included in the new duties when they come into force, the costs incurred by local or police authorities in connection with the registration and licensing and supervision as hackney vehicles being borne by the Road Fund. On this point the Committee wish to make it clear that the rates of new licence duties set out in Part III. have been settled on this basis and accordingly will require revision if any other charges, duties, or fees should be payable.26. Position of Motor Omnibus Undertakings. The Committee desire to draw attention to the fact that at the present; time a. number of statutory and private omnibus undertakings-are paying or being pressed to pay to road authorities sums of money in respect of maintenance and adaptation of roads. over which they rim their &apos;buses, and to point out that, in their opinion, if a scheme of taxation as recommended in this report is adopted, such demands and payments should cease, unless the circumstances involve abnormal costs.  ...........;  ......27. Power Alcohol. The Inter-Departmental Committee on various matters concerning tlie Production and Utilisation of Alcohol for Power and Traction Purposes (Cd. 213 of 1919) recommended that-&quot;having regard to the exemption of home produced benzole and shale motor spirit from the motor spirit tax (Excise), power alcohol, when produced in the United Kingdom, be correspondingly exempted, and that, having regard to the scope for earlier large production in the Empire overseas, importation of power . alcohol be permitted free of duty.&quot; .&apos;The Committee are of opinion that, in the event of any duty or excise being charged for administrative or fiscal reasons on&apos;power alcohol or other new motor fuel orb t
mixtures thereof used for road traction purposes, such duty or excise shall be recoverable in full by any consumer who has paid the statutory vehicle duty.28. Revision of Rates of Duty. As previously stated, the new scale of duties is devised to provide monies required for roads. These requirements will vary, and, in the absence of practical experience, it is difficult to estimate accurately either the financial results of such taxation or the rate at which it will increase with the development of motor road traffic, or, on the other hand, the total amounts which will be required for the roads from year to year. Under these circumstances the Committee consider that the proposed scale cannot be regarded as permanently fixed, but should be subject to annual revision, and they recommend that to enable this to be done satisfactorily, a small Committee should be appointed under the Ministry of Transport (on which the different road traffic interests should be represented) to take into consideration the requirements of the roads and to report annually as to the revision, if any, which may be desirable. The same Committee, with suitable representation, could act in an advisory capacity with regard to the levying and collection of the duties as set out in Part II.29. Carriage Licences and Motor Drivers&apos; Licences. There are three items which are not taxes on mechanically-propelled vehicles, namely: (a) Carriage duties upon horse-drawn vehicles.(b) Fees for motor drivers&apos; licences.(c) Penalties to be recovered for keeping vehicles without proper licences.As to (a), no change in the present rate of tax is recommended.With regard to (b) and (c), these sums are at present received and retained by the Local Authorities, but it is recommended that they should, in future, form part of the monies to be made available for roads, and that the whole costs incurred in connection with the issue of the licences and the recovery of the penalties be treated as part of the general costs of collection and paid out of the Road Fund.30. Legislation. The Committee recognise that, to give effect to some of their recommendations, new legislation will be necessary, and they propose to. address themselves to this subject immediately and make recommendations thereon. ;31. Date from which recommendations should take effect. The Committee are of the opinion that a convenient and, in fact, the only practicable date for bringing the new scheme of duties into operation is 1st January, 1921. In addition to administrative difficulties, as the single tax compounds the petrol duties and the existing carriage duties, it obviously would be inequitable to introduce the new scheme during the course of the present calendar year, during some months of which the petrol duties have been paid, and in respect of which licences for private motor cars and cycles have already been taken out. Moreover, it is desirable in present circumstances, that owners of mechanically-propelled vehicles should have adequate notice of the change in the system of taxation.32. Summary of Recommendations. The following is a summary of the recom-mendations contained in this part of the Committee&apos;s Report with regard to the proposed single tax system.(a) that a single tax based on the vehicle in accordance with the scale of duties set out in Part III. be adopted (para. 17).(6) that the principle involved in the allowance of rebates is an undesirable one, and should not be continued (para. 23) except in the case of private cars, the engines of which were constructed prior to 1913, in respect of which there should be an allowance of 25 per cent. (para. 24).(c) that the entire proceeds of the proposed single tax system (less certain expenses and payments to Local Authorities) should be devoted to maintenance, improvement, and construction of roads and bridges (para. 25).id) that the proposed single tax should be the sole tax or levy for imperial or local purposes to be imposed on the use of mechanically propelled road vehicles (para. 25). -(e) that all payments to local or police authorities, for registration of vehicles, and the licensing of hackney vehicles, should be included in the new duties when they come, into force, the costs incurred by Local or Police Authorities in connection with registration and licensing and supervision as Hackney Vehicles being, borne by the Road Fund (para. 25).
(/) that, if the scheme of taxation is adopted, no further payments should be made to road authorities by statutory and private omnibus undertakings in respect of maintenance and adaptation of roads over which buses run, unless the circumstances involve abnormal costs (para. 26).(g) that in the event of any duty or excise being charged for administrative or fiscal reasons on power alcohol or other new motor fuel or mixtures thereof used for road traction purposes, such duty or excise shall be recoverable in full by any consumer who has paid the statutory vehicle duty (para. 27).(h) that a small Committee be appointed under the Ministry of Transport to report annually as to the. revision, if any, which may be desirable in the proposed scale of duties and to act in an advisory capacity with regard to the levying and collection of the duties (para. 28).   .(i) that fees for motor drivers&apos; licences, and any penalties recovered for keeping vehicles without proper licences should form part of the monies to be made available for roads, and that the whole costs incurred in connection with the issue of the licences and the recovery of the penalties be treated as part of the general costs of collection and paid out of the Road Fund (para. 29).(j) that the proposed new duties should come into force on 1st January, 1921 (para. 31).33. Conclusion. In conclusion the Committee feel that this Report would be incomplete without a reference to the invaluable assistance they have received from Mr. W. Rees Jeffreys. At every stage of their Inquiry he has placed his great knowledge of this difficult subject unreservedly at the Committee&apos;s disposal regardless of time or trouble, and has attended Meetings in opposition to the advice of his medical advisers.   The Committee also desire to record their indebtedness to: Mr. F. H. Owers, the County Accountant of Essex.Mr. A. Collins, the City Treasurer of Birmingham.Mr. F. N. Smith, of the General Post Office, andMr. E. A. Lidbury, of the Customs and Excise Department.. These gentlemen, at the request of the Committee, have advised them as to the practical administrative difficulties likely to arise in the carrying out of various suggested schemes and as to the best methods to adopt to facilitate smooth administra-tion. Their practical knowledge of the present method of licensing and registration has rendered their advice invaluable.Part II. Details of Proposals.1. Basis of New Scheme. It is considered that any new scheme of taxation should embody as far as possible the following principles : (a) The system adopted for the levying and collection of the duties should be the same for the whole of the United Kingdom.(6) The County Councils and County Borough Councils with the co-opera-tion and assistance of the Post Office should be the authorities to undertake the actual levying and collection.(c) Licensing and Registration should be combined, and the new scale of duties should include all registration fees.(d) The costs incurred in connection with levying and collecting the duties by the Local Authorities and Post Office, together with the cost of registration, should be defrayed out of the proceeds of the duties.(e) As the principle has been conceded that the whole proceeds of such taxes, including the proceeds of motor drivers&apos; licences, subject at present to the deduction of certain prior charges, shall be devoted to road maintenance and construction, the Ministry of Transport should be the Government Depart-ment responsible for the supervision of the levying and collection.(/) It should provide so far as possible for easy and automatic levying combined with a small cost and the minimum of inconvenience to the motoring . community.2. Details of the Proposed Scheme. The details of the scheme now recom-mended as complying with the principles set out in the above paragraph are : (a) The duties throughout the United Kingdom to be levied and collected by the County Councils, County Borough. Councils, and the Post Office
(6) The issue of fixed yearly licences expiring on the 31st December in each year for motor cycles (licences for the last quarter to continue to be one half the full annual rate) and also for vehicles paying a nominal duty of 5s.(c) The issue of fixed yearly and fixed quarterly licences on payment of a premium of 20 per cent, above one quarter of the yearly tax, in respect of all other mechanically-propelled vehicles (excluding tramcars). Yearly licences to expire on the 31st December, and quarterly licences to expire on the 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December.(d) First licences in respect of all motor vehicles to be taken out with the Local Authority in whose area the vehicle is kept, who will issue to the licensees: (1) The licence, to be a card -of a distinctive colour, which will indicate thereby when it expires, and to contain, necessary particulars as to the name and address of the owner, registration number, horse power, unladen weight or seating capacity of the vehicle, and the amount of duty payable.(2) A book, somewhat on the lines of a Post Office Savings Book, containing full particulars in detail with regard to the vehicle and the name and address of the licensee, and particulars of registration.(e) The licence to be always carried on the vehicle in a conspicuous place where it can be seen by any passenger or when the vehicle is stationary by any police or taxation officer, and to be protected against damage by rain or other causes.(/) First licences to be renewable at any authorised Post Office on produc-tiou of the expiring licence and the book. The Post Office to issue a fresh card and enter in the book the date of renewal and amount paid, and to notify the Local Authority of such renewal.(g) If the licence is not renewed, the book and card must be forthwith surrendered to the Local Authority by whom they were issued.(h) If the vehicle is transferred, any current licence may be transferred &apos; with it, but the next licence must be taken out with the appropriate LocalAuthority who will re-register and issue a new book.(i) Changes of address of the owner to be notified to the Local Authority by whom the current licence was issued. If in consequence of any such, change of address the vehicle is to be kept in the area of another Local Authority, the next renewal of the licence must be made with the latter Local Authority who will re-register and issue a new book.(j) An owner of a private car who proves to the satisfaction of the Local Authority that the engine of such car was constructed prior to 1st January, 1913, to be entitled to a refund of 25 per cent, of all duties paid thereon from the date when the new duties come into force.Observations on the application of the principles enumerated in paragraph 1 to detailsof the Scheme set out in paragraph 2.1. As to (a) and (6). Uniformity of Levying and Collecting. The existing duties are now levied by the County Councils and County Borough Councils in England, Wales, and Ireland, but by the Customs and Excise in Scotland, the licences being issued through the Post Office, though in Scotland they are issued by the Customs and Excise officials also.The proposed transfer of the existing duties of the Customs and Excise officials to the County Councils and County Burgh Councils in Scotland, would lead to uniformity throughout the United Kingdom.2. As to (c). Combining of Registration and Licensing and abolition of Registra-tion Fees.-The present system of registration has been found quite unsatisfactory in practice. Further, it causes considerable inconvenience to the owners of mechanically propelled vehicles, as they have to register with the Local Authorities, and take their licences out at the Post Office. The combining of registration and licensing into one process would enable an efficient system of registration to be devised and avoid the existing inconvenience to the motoring community. The new scale of duties has been settled on the basis that it is to cover all taxes, charges, and fees to be paid in respect of mechanically-propelled vehicles, including the fees now payable in respect of regis-tration. The combining of licensing and registration, and abolition of the present registration fees, will require further legislation.
u3. As to (d). Costs of Levy and Collection, &amp;c. At the present time the Local Authorities in England and Wales receive a fixed grant towards the cost of collection which is entirely inadequate, with the result that the more efficiently an authority performs its duties the greater the loss it sustains. In Ireland the Local Authorities receive 5 per cent, of the duties collected. The whole costs should be paid out of the proceeds of tho tax. These are estimated at 300,0002. per annum, but may exceed this sum. Further, all costs incurred in connection with registration, the licensing of hackney vehicles, and the issue of motor drivers&apos; licences should be similarly borne.4. As to (e). Duties of Ministry of Transport. As the proceeds of the duties are to form a Road Fund, it is considered to be desirable that the responsibility for the supervision of the levying and collection of these duties should be vested in the Minister of Transport, and that to assist him to carry out these duties, a small standing Advisory Committee (to include representatives of the Local Authorities) should be appointed by the Minister so as to ensure efficiency and uniformity through-out the United Kingdom.5. As to (/). Advantages of Scheme. Under the scheme proposed, no vehicle can be on the road, unless a licence is in force for it, without the fact being advertised by its not carrying the proper card. This will render evasions very difficult, and thereby reduce the costs of levying and collecting. The convenience to the public of being able to obtain licences at Post Offices is retained, .so far as renewals are concerned, thereby also widely distributing the large amount of work which will have to be done consequent upon the addition of licensing of commercial vehicles, and the introduction of quarterly licenses. The owner of a vehicle avoids the trouble of separate registra-tion, and the registration system will become efficient. Further it is hoped that the scheme may be adapted so as to check the traffic in stolen motor vehicles.General Ohservations.Many suggestions and recommendations were considered before the present scheme was adopted, including-(a) The issue of moveable quarterly licences ;(6) The issue of quarterly licences for motor cycles;(c) The issue of yearly licences with a surrender value in respect of tho period unexpired at the date of surrender;(d) A system whereby licensees made deposits on first taking out licences ; such deposits to be forfeited on breach of the regulations ;(e) The allowance of a discount or discounts to private owners who take out licences for more than one car.Whilst many of these suggested systems presented attractive features, it was found to be impracticable to incorporate any of them because they are opposed to the fundamental principles of taxation, or involve insuperable administrative difficulties, or are in fact of no material advantage to the motor vehicle owner.Part III-Scale of Duties.Scheme of Taxation in respect of Road Vehicles to provide Revenue for State Contri-bution towards the Cost of Road Maintenance and Improvement under Section 17(2j of the Ministry of Transport Act, October 1919.General Notes applicable to the whole Scheme.(1) All licences to expire on fixed dates: Yearly Licences on the 31st December, and Quarterly Licences on the 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December.(2) A vehicle used for different purposes shall be liable to duty at the highest rate payable for any of the purposes for which it is at any time used during the current licence period.(3) Fees now charged by Local Authorities on registration and transfer of vehicles to cease to be payable.(4) The &quot; Rate Suggested &quot; below is the full annual rate.B 4

RIDER BY Mr. W. REES JEFFREYS.I have signed this Report subject to the reservations set out in Part I., but recommend the following modifications of detail which would in my view, and for the reasons explained, make the proposals more equitable and more generally acceptable.Rate per Unjt of Horse Power.(1) As a temporary measure and for the following reasons that the rate proposed for private motor vehicles foe reduced from 11. to 15s. per unit of HP. for the first year of the operation of the new scale of taxation.Since the rates mentioned as proposed to be applicable to private motor cars, hackney vehicles, and commercial goods vehicles were originally formulated the prices of motor spirit have advanced by over 20 per cent. While in the case of commercial and hackney vehicles the increased running costs can, in the main, be passed forward to the consuming public, there is no such possibility in the case of the private motor vehicle the owner of which has not only to bear the high initial outlay which is to some extent maintained by the import duties applicable to private motor vehicles, but must face himself the burden of heavy running costs.The result of a rate of taxation as high as 17.. per unit of H.P. combined with existing prices of motor spirit and initial cost will restrict the use of private motor vehicles, and this restriction will in turn react seriously on the British manufacturing industry which has laid itself out for large production.It is hoped that in the course of two years prices will be more normal but until such conditions are resumed some consideration should be given to the private owner and the British manufacturer and trader.The Committee of Revision proposed in paragraph 28 of the Report can of course at any time advise an increase of the duty or on the other hand if the total yield of the taxation is greater than is anticipated, they can recommend the continuance of the lower rate and extend a similar reduction to the rates applicable to hackney and commercial vehicles.Petrol Tax.   (May-December, 1920.)(2) That from the date of the Budget Resolutions in 1920 until 31st December 1920, a flat rate of 4id. per gallon shall be imposed on all imported motor spirits and that the system of rebates so far as motor vehicles are concerned shall be abolished.The abolition of rebates will go a long way to meet the official objections to the petrol tax and reduce the cost and labour of collection. Further a flat rate of tyd. a gallon for the remainder of the current calendar year will anticipate by a few months one of the objects of the new scale contained in this Report, viz., to divide the burden of the taxation more equitably than at present between the owners of private vehicles and the owners of commercial and public service vehicles on whose account the more costly works of road reconstruction are required. Incidentally the price of commercial motor vehicles has not been affected by reason of the operation of an import duty.(Signed)     W. REES JEFFREYS.13 note BY SIR THOMAS BERRIDGE.With some reluctance I have signed this Report as setting forth a method&apos; for dealing with what is really an emergency situation. I am still of opinion that the method of taxation proportionate to user, by means of a tax on liquid fuel, is by far the fairest and best, and notwithstanding all the difficulties which exist, this method of taxation should in my opinion be further examined. Inasmuch as the proposed single tax cannot come into operation until 1921, it is in my opinion desirable that the petrol duties should be continued until the end of the present year, the proceeds being restored for Road purposes, but that all rebates should he abolished.(Signed)     T. H. D. BERRIDGE.31sfc March, 1920.
RESERVATION BY MR. J. S. WILLIAMS.I have signed the Report, with which I am in general agreement, subject to the following comments : (1) The principle that all forms of road transport should make substantial contributions towards maintenance and improvement is, in my opinion, sound, and its application should not be limited to the period of existing financial conditions.(2) If the Imperial Subventions to Local Authorities are to be reviewed in the future, I consider that any readjustment of the 600,0002., guaranteed to the Local Authorities in lieu of the proceeds of the carriage licence duties in the standard year 1908-9, should not have the result of a charge against the Exchequer.(3) I consider that the expenditure of the Road Fund, from year to year, should be kept within the income which will enure to the Road Fund if the recommendations of the Committee are adopted.(4) The Establishment costs of the Roads Department of the Ministry of Transport should, in my opinion, be charged against the Road Fund. This was the procedure in the case of the Road Board, as provided in section 12 of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act, 1909.(Signed)     J. S. WILLIAMS.APPENDIX.ESTIMATED BUDGET.

APPENDIX II.MINORITY REPORT BY MAJOR STENSON COOKE.(Secretary, The Automobile Association and Motor Union).After careful consideration of the arguments raised in support of the removal of the petrol duty and the substitution of taxation, per unit of horse power for private motor vehicles, I am satisfied that these proposals are not only unsound in theory, but in practice will operate in an unreasonable and inequitable manner. As representing a large body of motoring opinion I am, therefore, compelled to dissociate myself from the Views of the Committee as embodied in their recommendations.I am convinced that the proposal to remove the petrol duty and substitute a heavy initial tax at a time when the whole motoring industry and community is in an unsettled condition is directly opposed to the interests of the country, and will have a disastrous effect on the development of motoring, particularly when, for instance, such tax will in effect almost quadruple the amount at present payable on a moderate priced utility vehicle.In dissenting from the decisions of the Committee, I am influenced by such considerations as : (a) That despite the proposed heavy increase, which presumably is intended to include the petrol tax already paid by the motorist, the Government are clearly unable to give any guarantee that when the duty is removed the petrol groups will give the consumer the benefit of any permanent reduction in price.(6) That the payment of a heavy initial tax- regardless of the extent to which the vehicle is used will operate unfairly : (1) Upon owners of low priced cars of moderate speed. (Powerful cars, costing four times as much as the cheap low pow*ered car usually owned by the motorist of moderate means, will actually pay less in taxation).(2) Upon persons owning two or three cars, only one of which is on the road at a time.(3) Upon the large number of owner drivers who, by force of&apos; circumstances are, throughout the whole year, only able to use their cars occasionally or at week ends.(c) That this special taxation of motorists is a road tax, but on the unit system the amount of tax paid bears no true relation to the extent to which the road is used.(d) That the removal of the petrol duty automatically withdraws the preferential treatment rightly accorded to Benzole, the chief home produced fuel, and thereby, strengthens the already powerful grip of the petrol groups upon both industry and user.(e) That the heavy taxation proposed will discourage motoring, resulting in a reduction in the output of new cars and the restriction of the use of those already existing, with a consequent loss of revenue.As I understand it, the object of the Minister of Transport in calling together representatives of the industry and the user was to find the best means of obtaining the maximum revenue with a minimum of hardship and irritation to those who have to pay. I am firmly of opinion that neither of these objects will be attained by taxation of the character recommended by the Committee, and in expressing that view I have also in mind the fact that it is much easier to collect a tax accepted as reasonable by the tax payer than to force upon a&apos; particular section of the public a tax which is resented as arbitrary and unfair.Not only do 1 disagree with the principle of the scheme recommended, but I question the method upon which the amount of the individual tax is arrived at, particularly in relation to private motor vehicles. The total sum required for road purposes is stated, and the individual tax is calculated on an estimate of the total number of vehicles likely to be in use at Midsummer this year (when the output of cars will still be restricted). It is, however, the intention that the proposed new taxes will not be operative until 1921, in which year the number of vehicles will have greatly increased and the individual contribution to the total sum required would be much smaller.
In spite of the arguments raised, I still maintain that as long as this specialtaxation of vehicles for road revenue is existent, there is no possible justification for &quot; imposing the whole burden of such taxation on one particular class of road user, and that all classes of vehicular traffic should contribute their proper quota for road purposes.In conclusion, I cannot too strongly urge that any increased taxation should be imposed by the continuance of taxation on imported motor spirit on a flat rate basis (excluding all rebates, and thereby reducing the cost of collection to a minimum) plus the reasonable readjustment of the existing vehicle taxes and accompanied by such necessary amendments as (a) the issue of quarterly licences, (b) the transfer of licences from one owner to another where a car or motor cycle changes hands, and (c) abatement of tax on old cars.I submit that by this means only is it possible effectively and justly to impose this special taxation, the chief essential of which is that each individual tax should be proportionate to, and directly governed by tho extent to which the vehicle uses the road.(Signed)     STENSON COOKE,Secretary, The Automobile Association 31st March 1920. and Motor Union.
