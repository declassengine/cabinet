Comparisons are being made as, for instance, between miners and the spinners or the dockers and the tramwaymen. Industrial peace, therefore, is not to be hoped for at present.Of the Easter Conferences that of the Independent labour Party has attracted moat attention.   There will be either a split -in the Party or a definite move of the whole organisation to the Left.   Its numerical strength is infinitesimal as compared with the whole body of Trade Unionists.The success of Iky Day in this country is not assured.  As it is a Saturday a certain number of men may absent themselves from work for the half day, but the strike is unlikely to be general.Strong language is being used by a certain section of ex-Service men and a number of blinded soldiers have already started on a march to London in the hope of getting the Government to give State support to the blind.Besides being in trouble with the staff, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is pressed for paper and is borrowing from other firms.   5)he first consignment of paper from Sweden arrived a week ago.   The transaction is being traced.   It will probably be found to be partof/
of the subsidy promised &quot;by Lenin&apos;s Government.The activity of Sinn Feiners in this country has broug the natural result of a growing hostility against Irishmen&quot; on the part of British lahour.   On M&amp;roh 89th some five &apos; hundred discharged soldiers oreated a disturhance because ai Irishman had insulted one of their comrades.There eeeras to he a growing tendency towards Communist: action among the Sinn Fein extremists in Ireland. The rscei cattle-driving is- mixed up with a demand by.the labourers ft a share in the land.
THS COAL MINESThe Government offer has broken up whatever unity there was among the miners...  Mr. tfrank Hodges and most of the responsible officials of the Miners1 Federation advised aooeptance but a majority of the*-rank and file in South Wales will probably vote against it.   The Syndicalists in South Wales are very busy and if they are not receiving material support from Russia the moral support is shown by a letter written by Ichitoherlne, in whioh he says that the Khondda Valley miners should be given financial aid by the &quot;English Communist Party&quot;f and by the anxiety of the Soviet Government that Robert Smillie should be a member of the Trade Union Delegation to Moscow.   The same letter states that Soviet Russia is fomenting revolutionary movements in England, France and Italy during the present Bpring and recommends strikes aa the best means of overthrowing the Capitalist system.In the Lancashire district an overwhelming majority against acceptance of the Government offer is believed to be certain.  Although the miners1 funds are low, the men think that the strike would be a very short struggle and that the Government would have to capitulate.  No doubt the fact that cotton operatives are earning as raudh as  9 a week is greatly- &quot;&apos;&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;&quot; &apos;,&apos;   .       * i&apos;. jr&apos;.:,;   y,-   :&apos; &apos;. ^  &apos; &apos; - [ .,&apos;    J : .   :- &apos; ,V ;tvi&apos;(   &apos;i &apos; -  ; .; .;  ;     . . 1 -. V;&apos;&apos;.  .&apos;&quot;        X &apos; tMi * - i i -    :&apos; &apos;:v:-       -l*&apos;-influencing them.The Warwickshire miners are also rather turbulent and will abate nothing from their demand.In Northumberland, Bur ham, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Horth Staffordshire, South Staffordshire and Worcestershire it is believed that the majority will vote for acceptance.A small majority of the Yorkshire miners will probably vote for it; the leaders are greatly afraid of a strike in the present depleted state of their exchequer.Although/
Although the Scottish officials have recommendedrejection it is not certain that a majority of the rank   j1and file will vote in support of them.It may he useful to.give here the approximate member-ship and funds of the various Associations.Name of Society            Membership		FundsDerbyshire Miners1 Association i	46,000	Durham Miners&quot; Association	112,000	 150,000Lanarkshire Miners1 Coinrty Union	50,000	  70,000Lancashire &amp; Cheshire Miners1 .

If May Day is a sucoess it will be because it is a Saturday and men who would not sacrifice a whole day&apos;s pay may absent themselves for a half day.   Mr. lansbury is urging that no evening papers be printed on May Day or morning papers on May End.The Communist International in Amsterdam has issued a call for an international general strike on May Day in support of peace with Soviet Russia, but this is not likely to carry much weight with workers in England. .TRAPS UNIONS AND THE CO-OP RATIYE movement the first annual meeting of the Joint Counoil took place on March 27th at the Memorial Hall.

1      IThe Press has given a prominence to the Independent Labour Party Conference which it scarcely deserves.   The actual membership of the Party is approximately 45,000 ani though there may be a number of sympathisers who have not actually joined, the total of members and sympathisers is infinitesimal fraotion of British Trade Unionists.   The&quot;Forward&quot;/of the London Sooioty of Compositors. Very little business appears to have been done, though speakers such as ErnestBevin, who was announced as &quot;the dockers&apos; ICC.&quot; (&quot;Killer oi4Capitalism&quot;), Fred Bromley and George Lonsbury did their best.   Bovin made his usual demand for a &quot;General Staff for Labour&quot; to provide a commissariat scheme for the country. , ,The Co-operative Societies believe that their sales fc; 1920 will exceed  100,000,000 as against  89,000,000 in 19 The net profit of  130,688 was carried to the reserve fund There was a large increase in the Banking Department, fvid^ my Report Uo. 37 of the 15th January last.).   The total acreage of farms owed and worked by Co-operative Societies] is 9,790, but the department showed a loss of  17,966. 8s,There was much hostile comment on the report of the Boyal Commission on Income Tax about the liability of the Co-operative Societies; a special Defence Fund is being &quot;formed and Members of Parliament are to receive protests -   from every part of the country.The Cardiff Branch has an Educational Committee vii ich expected largely to increase the membership locally.The Shop Assistants&apos; Union is^to have a ballot of its members on the question of amalgamating with the Union of Co-operative Employees.THE IU DEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY        THE MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL
&quot;Forward&quot; is not far wide of the mark when it writes inits current issue:&quot;Let us keep in remembrance the fact that the only International presently&apos; understood and appreciated by the bulk of the working class, was held a fortnight ago, when England beat Scotland by 4 goals to none.&quot; 1\On a card vote the Conference decided, by 529 votes to 144 to withdraw from the Second International, and rejected, by 47S votes to 206, a proposal to affiliate with the Third.The apparent victory of Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, who opposed affiliation to the Third International, has not solved   his difficulties, for Lenin1s lieutenants in Holland are throwing cold water on the plan of building up yet another International.   These extremists, who are in Lenin&apos;s pay, say that the foundation of anew International &quot;can have no other result but to weaken, to clog and to hinder revolutionary action in the proletarian masses and thus to hold back the formation of the Soviet system and the establishment of a Dictatorship of the Proletariat in Europe and in America&quot;.   They are particularly angry with the Independent Labour Party&apos;s demand for the autonomy of each nation within the International, for this, they say, would mean the repudiation of &quot;the disciplined and centralised action of the workers of&apos;all countries.&quot;THE BRITISH SOCIALIST PARTY CONFERENCEOn April 4th and 5th the Annual Conference was held at Bethnal Green under the Presidency of Councillor Vaughan, the local Bolshevik Mayor.   The speeches were frankly revolutionary but the value of the resolutions was summed up by George Deer, the extremist, as &quot;Utopian&quot; and &quot;moonshine and waste of time&quot;. By sixty votes to twenty-four the Conference passed a resolution deferring the question of withdrawing from the Labour Partyuntil/
until the dissensions regarding a United Communist Party were at an end.Here again the Press gave undue prominence to the Conference.There was a curious incident during the Conference. John MoLean rose and made charges against the leaders of being police spies; he further cited the money spent on young Bothstein1s education at B&amp;lliol and hinted that he was an agent provocateur of the Government.   It was decidei to hold a secret meeting of the Executive to investigate the charges.   At this meeting McLean argued quite temperat and with some superficial logic that the money, received by Theodore Rothstein and Albert Inkpin was Government money: he cited incidents that could only be explained on this hypothesis, and he challenged them to produce evidence of the source of the money,   In reply, Inkpin assured his hearers that every penny came either directly or indirectly from the Soviet Government; that it came by secret couriers to him and that he handed it on to Theodore Rothstein.   The Communists have been slow to realise, what was patent to everyone else, that John McLean is the victim of the monomania of the &quot;hidden hand&quot;, and they are now reaping a harvest of suspicion from their loyalty to him.   McLean&apos;sf obsession is quite likely to break up the Communist movement, for he has a large following in Glasgow and in season and out of season he gives vent to these denunciatio The Executive of the British Socialist Party has warned Lenin of John McLean7s mental state and in future the Soviet Government will not have relations with him, though he is still their official representative in Glasgow.   He is of that temper whioh will become more uncompromising if any attempt is made to silence him.FEBLIUG/
PEELIHG AMONG EX-SERVICE MENMi-pay......mm+mmmmmwmmm .uw tBii-in^uwi^niwi-iKOfwii &apos; - *.......mm i.h,.*mi-iniw-Mm     &apos;*The firBt Annual Conference of the National Union of Ex-Service Men at Birmingham was attended by ISO delegates, and if one may judge by the violence of the language used by some of the delegates tho National Union is drifting rapidly to the Left.   Glasgow delogates even suggested that in order to show the Government that they meant business they should adopt the methods of the Sinn Foiners in Ireland (Che &quot;Red Flag&quot; was sung and arrangements appear to have been made for a demonstration in Hyde Park on April 18th. It transpired, however, from a statement of the Chairman, that the members are more ready with speeches than with money and that the financial position of the Union is very unsatisfactory.Woolwich, hitherto a storm centre, has been fairly quiet during the week, perhaps owing to the absence of Prank Gildon, the arch-agitator.In South Wales and Coventry there is a good deal of support for the proposal to amalgamate the National Federation with the Comrades of the Great War.The actual position of the revolutionary International Union of Sx-Service Men is difficult to appraise.   The head office in London at 95, Minories, is to be closed but, on the other hand, it is claimed that two new branches have been formed in London and two more are projected at Stepney and Hackney.In four recent reports mention has been made of EX-LIEUTENANT NICHOLSON, who has been distinguished for the violence of his language.   The life history of this man is interesting.   Frederick George Joseph Lister Nicholson was born in 1884 of(well-to-db parents and is well educated, buthe/
ha appears to he quite lacking in the moral sense.   At thoage of fifteen he married an actress who divorced him.   He  4then wont to America hut returned and married another lady,who also divorced him.   When quite a boy, in association with another man, he broke into his motherfs house and threatenedher with a revolver, so terrorising her that she gave himinto custody.   Ho than Joined tho 7th Dragoon Guards and sawservice in South Africa, where he loBt his right eye.   the following criminal convictions are recorded against him:October 21st, 1903    ..   Bound over at tho South LondonSessions for burglary.April 25th, 1910   .....   Fined for stealing a vegetabledish, for common assault and for refusing to quit licensed promises at Fareham.February 6th, 1911   ...   Hampshire Assizes, eighteen months&apos; hard labour for stealing) a diamond brooch.Ho returned to this country about 1917, stating that he had served with the Australians in Gallipoli, where ho was wounded and treated in a hospital in Malta.   Enquiries were made by his friends and no verification of the statements could be obtained.   When next seen he stated that he had been an Observer in the Royal Flying Corps, but this could not be verified and some people believe that he was a civilian clerk attaohed to the Flying Corps at Uxbridge.On the whole, it seems not unlikely that the Service Associations will decline in membership and eventually disappei as men get absorbed into the ranks of labour, and, much as thi is to be regretted from some points of view, it is better than the present tendency to absorb revolutionary doctrines.HANDS OFF russia the interest in the Russian question has declined and my correspondents report that the best anti-Bolshevik propagandaw
is coining from the refugees and repatriated prisoners.A pamphlet entitled &quot;The Photographic History of the Bolshevik Atrocities&quot; is attracting attention in South W&amp;les.   It contains reproductions of photographs brought baok from South Russia, and strikers were heard to remark that they &quot;did not know them &quot;blighters had been doing anything like this.&quot;LABOUR COUNCILLORSMy Yorkshire correspondent reports that the Urban District Council elections in his area have resulted in a failure of the Labour candidates.   Only about one-third of the electors went to the poll: the organised workers were at a football match and the shopkeepers and middle classes generally had taken to heart the lesson given them by the Municipal suocesses of Labour last November.   In Leeds Mr. T. B, Duncan, the Lord Mayor, has not been a success; he has committed the unpardonable crime of lecturing his own Party and they are furious with him.   On the other hand, at Bradford the Labour Councillors are doing well, and Leach, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, an Independent Labour Party man, is proving himself an able administrator.STATE MAINTENANCE. OF TEE BLINDLabour extremists have been exploiting the discontent among the blind with such success that a march to London from all parts of the country has been arranged &quot;to call attention to the shameful way the blind have been treated by the Government.&quot;   The blinded men intend  0 oall on the Prime Minister.   They are timed to reaoh London on April 25th.   They are to be provided with free meals andcollections/
collections are being made on their behalf.   The Plymouth and Lancashire contingents have already started, j One of them said, &quot;We are going to ask Labour to use the j ^ strike weapon In our behalf.&quot; jMr. Ben Purse, President of the National League of thi\ Blind, is a man of extreme views.THE KATIOBAL UfllOM Off TEACHERSIA large number of teachers have been drifting towards Labour.   In view of the Influence which these men and womes have over their pupils their trend towards the Left is of great importance.   It is due almost entirely to the question of pay.&quot;THg &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;The crisis in the staff of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; still continues.   The first anniversary was celebrated by a dinnel on April 1st, at which Tom Mann and Prank Hodges were present.   Mr. Lansbury stated that his recent visit to Russia had made him more &quot;Red&quot; than ever before.For some time the office has been reduced to borrowing! paper wherever it could be got, but last week it received &apos; 333 bales from Gothenburg.   The transaction is being traced in Sweden but no doubt it is part of the subsidy given by Lenin.   There was a curious incident last week when the Stepney dockers refused to unload a cargo of paper for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; because it had been loaded by non-Union labour in Holland during the dock strike.   One of them remarked, &quot;It does seem funny to me that this vessel, loaded by blackleg labour, &quot;should have as its only cargo rolls of paper for our own Labour newspaper.&quot;Mr. Lansbury has written an instructive letter toLitvinoff/
Litvinoff, in which he says, &quot;I wonder if it would he possible to get a statement out that the dictatorship of the minority is only a temporary business.   You see, people on this side are trying to argue that a new governing class ,  has arisen in Russia and that you will beoome simply a kind of clique, with the mass of the people objecting to obeying your orders.   In effect, of cpurse. this is true, but it is only a transitional business and it wants saying in an authoritative way by one of you that this is so.&quot;TBSODOREi ROMSTBUr*Rothstein is reported to be giving a weekly subsidy of  20 to the Glasgow Socialist Research Bureau.  He is also believed to be giving  7. 10s. -d. a week to Walton Kewbold ! and his wife to lecture to Independent Labour Party branches.SlgNJglg m 0R3AT BRITAIN jCouncillor Ryan has informed Glasgow that all arrangements for the conference of branoheB of the Irish Labour Party in Great Britain at Gateshead on April 11th are complete.   Messrs. James Roe, John Devine and Thomas Murray have been elected by ballot to represent Glasgow. They have been instructed to vote in favour of the Irish Labour Party remaining apart from all British political parties, including the Labour Party and the Scottish Division of the Independent Labour Party. ,1My correspondents report that only about 200 Sinn \Feiners left Glasgow for Ireland at Easter; they came chiefly from Paisley, greenock, Hamilton and Glasgow.   The looal hotheads threaten that if the present situation in Ireland continues, they will organise raids and place injeopardy/      f
Jeopardy the lives of prominent Glasgow Parliamentarians who have publicly expressed their opposition to Sinn Fein, The older men, however, advise restraint and patience.From Liverpool my correspondents report that the      * Easter exodus to Ireland was smaller than usual; the feeling of Englishmen against Irishmen in this area is growing: they allege that Irishmen can always get a job whereas they are dismissed.   On March 28th there vms a disturbance at Middleton, when some 500 discharged soldier demonstrated outside the house of an Irishman whose son ha insulted and struok one of their comrades.   The Irishman ii question had not served with the Forces.From all over the country reports are received that the membership of the Self Determination League is growing,The Irish in London consider the Home Rule Bill &quot;so much bluff&quot; for America; In whose eyes it will justify england action subsequent to the passing of the Bill. The membership of the League is considered satisfactory but it is badly in need of organisers and speakers.De Valera is reported to have left the United States and to be on his way to Ireland or some European destinatipIRELAND4The past week was again a very bad one and the state o the country, apart from the Province of Ulster, which remains quiet, appears to be rapidly drifting from bad to worse.   The police are unable to cope with the situation and the military are unable at present to afford adequate . assistance in country districts.Up to Friday morning. April 2nd, over one hundred outrages had been specially reported, but this number is far short of the real total and many incidents, of course, are not reported to the police at all, the suffererspreferring/
preferring to bear their misfortunes in silence rather than run the risk of additional intimidation and outrage, and to this must now be added the Easter orgy of incendiarism.The situation is probably quite beyond the more moderately inclined of the Sinn Fein party and there are no signs of improvement.The inquest on Alderman Thomas MaoCurtain, late Lord Mayor of Cork:, attracted a great deal of attention all the week and was fully reported in all papers.   The Sinn Fein party is sparing no effort in the endeavour to make it falsely appear that the murder was oommittei by the police and feeling is running very high.&quot;Old Ireland&quot; and the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot; appeared as usual during the week.   The latter apologises for its non-appearance last week &quot;owing to circumstances which for once were too many for us&quot;.   The tone of both papers, particularly the &quot;Watchword of Labour&quot;, is extremely bad, and the latter is to be seized wherever found.   Both these papers are now printed in Salford.There is no change in the industrial situation but the general tendency of the present situation is towards Bolshevism.Ex-soldiers in Ireland are said to be throwing in their lot with Sinn Fein owing to their grievances about pensions and allowances.
