Offensive.A message was received from Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, on the 22nd March quoting General Turner as stating that a secret service agent had reported the. Bolsheviks to be preparing their Fleet for sea to harass Finnish and Lettish ports in order to enable them to impose unfavourable peace terms.   Although the reliability of this report could not he gauged it was a contin-gency that should be guarded against and General Turner asked what action the British Fleet would take.     Senior Naval Officer, Baltic added his opinion that/ taking into consideration the defenceless state of the Baltic provinces on the Sea, the Soviet Government should be informed that such action on their part could not be tolerated by the Allies, and that the handing over or effectual, disarmament of all the Bolshevik ships should be insisted on before any negotiations were entered into with the Soviet Go-fcern-ment on other matters.Senior Natfal Officer, Baltic, further asked if the orders in force last year as to the action to be taken on meeting Bolshevik Men-of-War or Armed Auxiliaries at sea i.eM that their intention should be assumed to be hostile, should still be acted upon.In reply the following telegram, No. 993 was sent to Senior Naval Officer; Baltic&quot;Pending further instructions which will be sent you when Cabinet decision ha3 been reached,, previous orders are to hold good.You are requested to report the earliest date on which you consider it may bar possible for vessels to moVe out of Kronstadt or Petrograd,&quot;In reply to the latter part of this message, Senior Naval Officer, Baltic, wired that Kronstadt wa3 usually open for icebreakers between 7th and 18th April and to ordinary ships 7 to 10 days later.&apos;     Petrograd wa3 open two or three weeks after Kronstadt.Exchange of  risdrfrers.TAGUS,&apos; escorted by THA1IET sailed from Hango for Southampton on the 26th with the first batch of British repatria-ted from Russia.

The fighting may at any moment assume more than local importance,   Mr.Tallents states that unless Allies or League of Nations exercise prompt pressure to secure conclusion of a just peace between Poland and both Lithuania and Bolsheviks, the eventualities of next month would appear certain to lay the foundation for a series of new wars.The War Office has instructed Officers of the Baltic Mis3ions that they are not to take part as advisers in the event of a conflict and that it is essential that nothing shall inter-fere with Foreign Office control of our policy.   The Missions will be gradually reduced and tho3e remaining appointed as advisers to F.O.

The Fjinnish Minister of Foreign Affairs has asked unofficially whether it could be arranged th^t British Warships should patrol the Gulf of Finland until a conclusion of peace with Soviet Russia.    Ice conditions are reported to be rapidly becoming favourable for naval movements.MED ITEKRANSM AND BLACK SEA,Constantinople.A report from G.H.Q., Constantinople, dated 19th March, states that the town continues quiot, and the Naval and Military precautions have been relaxed with the exception of special patrols and guards.Many important political arrests have been effected.In reply to a telegram asking what Naval steps he would propose to enforce Peace terms in the event of Turkey refusing to accept them, and if measures could be taken to exer-cise pressure by blockade, the Commander-in-Chief has/replied  .    *
replied that lpreseure by blockade of Asia Minor is not reoommendfid xor the^following reasons *-Demands on Allies for ships, especially patrol craft, would be exorbitant and length of coast line so great that blockade would only be partially effective.Trading and industrial communities, chiefly Greeks and Armenians, would be principally injured.The Turks have few wants.   During the last five years they have been practically blockaded by sea, and with resources of interior could withstand a further period without distress.Blockade by us would bring about cessation of food supplies.from Asia Minor to Constantinople and Western Europe and present economic situation would become still more difficult.Turkish form of retaliation to all vexatious or repressive measures by us would be persecution of Christians.Other forms of Naval action are destruction of Turkish Fleet and Naval war mo,terialy seizure and occupation of Turkish Islands and, in conjunction with the Military, control of the more important Turkish Ports.It has been proposed to the French  ,../3 rnroent that ensral Franchet dfEsperey shall command all Allied troops in Turkey in Europe., exclusive of Constantinople, and that General Milne shall command in Constantinople itself*General Milne is to inform General Franchet d? Esperey that he regards Thrace as entirely the latter*s s &amp;ere of action and takes no responsibility there.The Grand Vizier has forwarded to the High Comraiss-ioners a protest against the occupation of Constantinople. The protest is based on the absence of justification, as no disorders existed or could have been anticipated in any part of Turkey where Allied forces were sufficiently strong to prevent thenu The movement in Anatolia, according to the note, owed its origin to the Greek occupation and its consequent horrors, but was further intensified by the rumours of the intension to create a big Armenia and a Greek Pontus.The central Government disapproves and disavowes the excesses committed in this movement., for which it was not responsible and which it was unable to control in conse-quenoe of the circumstanees arising out of the prolonged armistice conditions and the limits placed on its authority.General Frawratd^sperey wishes to blow up the guns of the Coast defence batteries on Gallipoli peninsula and has asked if the Inspector General of Allied troops in Turkey in Europe has. any objection to the French Navy doingtfcAs* General Milne has replied that neither he nor General Wilson think the time for this destruction has come.The Eskishehir force is now being withdrawn thus leaving the Anatolian railways entirely in the hands of the ,-. Nationalists,   The question of food supply at Constantinople therefore becoming serious.Thirteen prominent Turks arrested bp the Allied on the occupation of Constantinoftle have been despatched to Maltain/
f - 4 jiin H.M.S. &quot;BKBCf&quot;,In spite of the denial issued by the Azerbaijan Government and confirmed &quot;by the po.rte, Admiral do Ro&amp;eck is con-vinoed that an understanding exists between Azerbaijan and the Turkish Nationalists,   lie is opposed to the Azerbaijan Government being supplied with war material of any sort so long as their Army is controlled or instructed &quot;by Turkish Officers,Refupees,Telegraphing on 22nd March Commander-in-Chief reports that the situation at lTovorcssis.V. is developing very rapidly and the Senior Ha^al and Military Officers are despatching ships full of refugees and sick and wounded who cannot be left to the Red3. Action is being taken to provide a camp at lEudros for 10,000, made up of 2,000 wounded and 8.000 families of Officers and men and compromised officials.    Commander&apos;&quot;in-Chief asks that camp equip-ment and provisions be sent from Ssypt and is sending to Mudros a delected portion of the British Military Mission on return from Novorossisk to organise and start camps.The attitude of the Egyptian and Cyprus authorities in refusing to receive refugees is adding to the difficulties of the Commander-in-Chiefa    The Treasury object to supply funds for maintenance until questions have been decided whether joint Allied responsibility is to be undertaken.   Meanwhile sanction has been given to appropriate  10;000 Foreign Office funds to meet immediate needs of situation,&apos;and question of future maintenance has been placed before Council of Amba^oad^rs, Paris.    Colonial Office has wired Cyprus asking that every endeavour be made to assist the Commander-in-Chief8 and to receive refugees if reasonable provision can be made for isolation of infected cases.    The fall of Novorossisk will further add to the congestion.Naval Policy^Instructions were sent to the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean on 25th March, that the Cabinet had decided that the British navy is not to take offensive action against the Soviet Government but that this decision does not apply to any measures necessary to ensure safety of Mission and evacuation of refugees under Mackinder guarantees    The French Government, acting on Supreme Councilfs decision of 24th February, have instructed. Admiral de Eon that assistance can be given only to the frontier states in the event of Bolshevik attack and that no further support is, to be given to the Volunteer Forces.Crimea,No material change.    Denikin proposes to assume command, but confidence in him is undoubtedly siiaken even amongst fighting troops and therois much intrigue against him in the Crimea,,    It is suggested that he should hold the Crimea and commence negotiations with the Bolsheviks.     This suggestion has been communicated and ackowledged by Denikin.OAS?IAN,G.0,C. Mesopotamia wired 10th March that it-was reported that Admiral Sergeieff intended to make Enzeli a sub-base for Caspian Fleet,   Permission has been asked from the Persian Government to allow Officers and families, about 700, to enter Persia via Enzeli,   Persian Government reluctant to give permission and ask whether this could not be arranged via Baku and Batcunu   Admiral Sergeieff left Enzeli on lot!
