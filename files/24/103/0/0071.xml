From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,10th April 1920.(Received 12th.)4537. 10th April. Continued friction between Malleson and Grey at Meshed, created situation which is clearly detrimental to interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and we have therefore been compelled to recall Malleson to India. Fuller papers follow by post. While there is no doubt fault on both sides we consider simultaneous recall of both would be disturbing element in situation and leave very bad local impression.Moreover, Grey enjoys confidence of Governor-General, whereas Mallesons relations with him are exactly opposite, and it is most desirable in present juncture to retain goodwill of local Persian officials.2. We are replacing Malleson by Brigadier-General (? Leslie), now Inspector-General of Communications in East Persia, who will take over command and administration of all troops at and beyond Meshed in addition to assuming charge of Mission. No alteration is contemplated in intelligence work (corrupt group) by present Intelligence Staff under General Malleson.
