T    ^ &apos; 349IMS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT * I SHOOT.CABINS T. fjPROPOSED   MINISTRY   OF   MIHSSA HOTS by the   President   of   tho   Board   of   Education. irIn CP.513 and 604 the President of the Board of Trade suggested that, among other things, there should be transferred to a Ministry of Mines and Minerals -A. Functions now exercised by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as regards the Geological Survey and Museum and Mining Research.B. Functions no?/ exercised by tho Board of Education as regards Mining Education.The attached Notes A. and B. set out in detail the reason which, in my viow, males it undesirable that either of these seta of functions should be transferred to the proposed new Ministry.As regards A*, it seems to Lie essential that the work now being done by the Government in connection with the Geological Survey and Mining Research should be kept independent of all considerations of commercial exploitation or administrative application and thut accordingly this should continue to be-done by the Central Research Department of whose &quot;disinterested&quot; attitude there can be no doubt.As regards B-, I feel that, apart from the important question of principle involved in taking cut of the hands ofthe Central Department supervising Education of all kinds the responsibility for the education required by a particular Industry, there are practical difficulties inherent in our Educations! System which would make it most undesirable to transfer powers exercised by the Education Department to a Ministry of Mines.0 (^. 1094(Sgd)H. A. L. FISEER.Board of Education, 16th April, 1980.
NOTE ON THE MEMORANDUM BY THE&apos; &apos;PRES1D&apos;ENT 0p THt? goAtii) 0&apos;f TRADE ON THE PROPOSED   &apos; MINISTRY 0.^ MINES AND MINERAL:. AND ON THE AOCOMPANDING RECOMMENDATIONS,&apos;I.GEOLOGICAL ggRVgY ASP, MUSEUM *  &apos;   V(I) Views of the Coal Conservation Committee,of the Ministry of-Reconstruction. -The Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade proposesto transfer the Geological Survey and Museum 16 a new Ministry of mines and Minerals;     and in support of this proposal a passage fromthe Report of the Mining Sub-Committee of the Coal ConservationCommittee of the Ministry of Reconstruction is quoted in the&quot;Recommendations&quot; appended to the Memorandum.     In this passagethe Sub-Committee recommended that (with certain exceptions)all government functions with regard to Mines-should be&apos;transferred toa Ministry of Mines and Minerals.    But,in the paragraph of theirReport which immediately follows the passage quoted in the Board ofTradefs &quot;Recommendations&quot; the Sub-Committee declared explicitly:-&quot;The principal exception to the transfer we recom--mend is the Geological Survey which we think should betransferred from the Board of Education to the Committeeof the Privy Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-. search.    The results of .its work would then form partof the growing body of knowledge and information whichit is the special functions of that Department to create,co-ordinate, and place at the disposal of all otherDepartments&quot;. ...   * -&quot;-The recommendation which.the Coal Conversation Committee made,after full consideration of mining requirements and of the func-tions and work of the Geological Survey,and Museum, Was that&apos; these services should be transferred to the Department- of scientific and Industrial Research, not to a Ministry of Mines.     The Govern-ment adopted the CommitteeTs recommendation.     The transferencerecommended by the Committee was carried out on 1st November last--1- and/
and the Department of Scientific and Industrial &apos;Res-earch is now actively engaged on the development of the work of the Survey in directions which have been suggested within recent years.&apos;(ii) C ons icier at i ons affect ing J:he proposed transfer&apos; of theQeuljgioal Survey from the Research Department to a Ministry of Mines,(a) The fundamental duty of the Geological Survey is to obtain, record and publish information as to the geology of the whole country.    &quot;This is essentially a research for general purposes..     In it, observation, investigation, and congelation have to be, carried out in such a way as to provide not merely results, of immediate use but also, information which may be of value in future in directions at present unforeseen.(b) The results of the work of the Survey are in request for many-purposes other than those - of.mining - e.g. in questions affecting water supply, disposal of sewage      agriculture, foundations, roadmaking, railway and canal construction^(c-) The primary Field work of the.Survey is indeed pureresearch.   The Survey Maps&apos;and Memoirs are not confined to mining areasj   for economic as well.as for scientific purposes, they are equally necessary in- other districts.(d) These Maps and Memoirs take-note of existing or possibleeconomic utilisation of the mineral resources to which they apply.    Special attention is given to the investigation andrecord of matters of economic importance and special publica-tions are issued with reference to these;   e.gB in Sanitationand Water supplyj   and on Mineral Resources.It is, however, recognised that the Survey should keepmore continuously in touch with mining and quarrying industries;In particular it is desirable that the surveys of mining areas should be subjected to revision in the light of additionalgeological information obtainable in the course of currentmining operations or by periodic re surveys...   The Staff of the survey/
Survey has hitherto been insufficient to meet these require-ments adequately and proposals for its increase in this respect were made on the conclusion of the work of the Royal Commission on Coal Supplies (1905).     Such proposals have recently been revived and have been formulated after examination by the Geological Survey Board under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, e)        In its work the Geological Survey co-operates closely with geologists in all parts of the country and with mining engineers and others connected with mining.    Experience of many years has shown that, with rare exceptions, the assistance which the officers of the Survey receive in this way is afforded most readily.     It is of high value in relation to the scientific and economic results of the activities of the Surrey.   The facilities and help which a Survey recognised as a research and record institution, thus receives at all hands, would not be accorded, with equal freedom to a Survey working under a Department con-cerned in the exploitation, development and utilisation of mines, or in the supervision of mining practice in relation to Regulations and Control.II.MINING     RESEARCH.(iii) Considerations affecting the proposed transfer of Mining;&apos;  Research from the Research Department to the Ministry of Mines.(f)        The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research holds a Parliamentary grant-in-aid of  1,000,000 from which grants may be made to encourage the establishment of Research Associations by Industries or groups of related Industries, It would not be easy to exclude Research Associations which may be established hereafter by Mining industries from participa-tion in the benefits afforded by the grant of  1,000,000 held by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.(g)
It Is desirable that the Department of Sc^ntific andIndustrial Research should continue to make provision in itsannual estimates, where necessary, for the continuance of scientific research affecting Mining industries for thereasons set out below.     These reasons are based upon theexperience gained by the Advisory Council In the four.years during which it has been at work.(i)   If the organisation of research for public pur-poses is to be effective and economical it is necessary to arrange for a central clearing house which will be cognisant of the general lines of research undertaken by different   Departments of Government, and a central body connected therewith capable of undertaking or organising research which can best be conducted by one agency in the Interests of all.(ii)   If e Department were, to combine the function of organising scientific research with that of dealing with the exploitation or commercial development or administrative application of,the results which may be obtained by the research, it would constantly be called upon to settle questions of profit.and expediency arising In the course of administration,, which would certainly be thought to affect, even if they could In practice be prevented from influencing the scientific findings for which the Department would be responsible.
X*   The quostion of r^one^a! prlncinlc^    The Machinery of Government Committee came to the conclusion (paragraph 18,page 8) that the distribution of departmental duties should be guided by a general principle,.     They were of tho opinion that distri-bution according to the nature of the service to be rendered to the community as a whole is the principle that will load to the minimum of confusion and overlapping.    The residual overlapping that must be accepted as inevitable can be met by systematic arrangements for Collaboration between Departments jointly interested in particular spheres of work.    Of education, in particular, the Committee say that the Ministry of Education should be predominantly concerned with the provision of education, wherever and by whomsoever needed.In the existing distribution., this principle is not fully observed;   but the Commit/tee (paragraph 12, page 55) did not exclude the possibility that at some future time the Board of Education might be found to be the Central Authority best qualified to assume the entire or tho main responsibility for the administration of the educational services for which at present other Departments may be answerable to Parliament.An out and out transfer from the Board of Education to a   , Department of nines and Kinerals would directly contravene the principle recommended by the Machinery of Government Committee.2. Practical Obstacles to Transfer. Apart from the above objection on grounds of principle to an out and out transfer, very serious practical difficulties stand in the way.EI;TCLQ,SIJREiuiBtMEMORANDUM ON THE SUGGESTION THAT THE POTTOS OR DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION IN REGARD TO MINING EDUCATION SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO A DEPARTMENT OP EINES AND MINERALS OR SHOULD BE EXERCISED OR PERFORMED BY THAT DEPARTMENT CONCURRENTLY OR IN CONSULTATION r:ITH THE BOARD OF EDUCATION..
(p.) Mining Educationt as the Board arc concernod with it,may be divided into -&quot;(i) the vocational and general education of youngpersons in the Mining Industry, which Is usually carried onin Evening Continuation Schoolsj(ii) the vocational education:of older persons engagedin the industry which is usually carried on in the TechnicalSchools, and to some extent by University Institutions havingMining Departments;(iii) the vocational education of persons aspiring topositions of professional or semi-professional standing in theindustry, which is carried on in Technical Schools and inUniversity Institutions *There is one institution in South Fales which is exclusively concerned with Mining Education and is under a Governing Body representing Mine Owners and no one else.     There are one or two small Institutions in the Midlands which, are exclusively concerned with Mining Education, but these are provided and maintained by County Councils as Local Education Authorities responsible for all types of Education,     Such important centres of Mining Education as the llTigan Mining and Technical School, the Stoke-on-Trent School of Science and Technology,&apos; and the Cornwall School of Metalliferous Mines at Camborne are Institutions which provide other types of education, e,g,, in all three there are courses in Engineering for students who are not necessarily connected with the Mining Industry,     In these important centres of Mining Education,, tho staffs and other resources of Departments of Science and Engineering are used to supplement those of the Departments in Mining in order to provide the comprehensive courses that Mining Engineers, for example, are accustomed to attend. Evening Continuation Schools again, where - the lower grades of Mining Education are carried on and, in particular, where young persons engaged in the Mining Industry are taught, generally offer
instruction in other subjects as well as in Mining subjects,, and in some cases younger students divide tho time they give to conttaSfcqgtheir education between subjects directly con-ncctod with Mining and subjects of general education which arc not so connected.(b) The technical and administrative difficulties of Isolating Mining education in su$h circumstances as those described above, as a matter to be removed from the purview of the Board to that of another Department, are obvious and formidable.(c) Further, It must&quot;be romembored that a very great proportion of the Mining education which Is now offered is provided and maintained by Local Education Authorities.    Those bodice-are extremely reluctant to come into relations with other Government Dcp-departments because the multiplication of such relations adds to the difficulties of their own administration.5* Treatment of Mining Education by the Board of Education It is not - claimed that Mining Education is either fully efficient, or that there is a fully &amp;evcljcrpc4^ysdxmL. For the purpose-aC?- , Ijnpjwis^pe^ &amp;rr&amp;Laf two-expert Inspectors with ample experience ir the Coal Mining industry.    The services of those Officers aro for the present directed mainly to (i) advising Local Education Authorities in whose areas the Mining Industry is carried on, and through thorn, tho teachers who instruct Mining students, as to the curricula, equipments, etc., of tho Centres of Mining instruction;   and (ii) encouraging tho Authorities to appoint Organisers to bo specially responsible for the dotailod supervision of the Centres and for the extension of the provision already existing by the opening, of now Centres *    The training of teachors is also receiving attention.    An experiment designed to improve the efficiency of tho existing teachors Is being conducted undor tho direct super-vision of the Board at r-Tormanton and at Stoke-on-Trent,    For the present. It is difficult to find other teachors of young
persons engaged in the Mining industry than professional teachers., but the training offered is available for persons engaged in the industry, should any such desire to obtain some knowledge in the methods of teaching.     The Board are always ready to consider suggestions put forward on behalf of the industry, for the improvement of Mining education, but so long as tho country must look to the Local Education Authorities for the supply of Mining Education in Technical Schools and other local centres, the Board is tho central Authority most likely to bring about improvement and development-.4. Relations^with other Government Departmentsc(a) In existing circumstances,     The Home Office now deals with tho qualifications of persons employed in various capacities in Mining, and in this connection has constituted a Board of Mining Education,     The candidates in these Examinations have, as&quot; a rule, studied Mining in Institutions supervised and aided by the Board of Education,     There is not at present any formal system of collaboration, between the two departments, but informal consultations take place at the instance of cither Department,(b) If a Department of Mines is established.     If the proposed new  Department is established exercising wider powers than those of the Home Office, the Board&apos;s Officers would not merely accept the obligation to work in consultation with it, but rjould welcome tho opportunity of continuing and developing the informal relations that now- exist,&apos;    No statutory provision is necessary, and experience docs not&apos;suggest that there Is any advantage in defining by Statute or by Order a duty to collaborate.    The Board, at least, would&apos;cheerfully accept such a duty In.tho interests of efficient education^
