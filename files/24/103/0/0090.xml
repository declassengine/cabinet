QABIHE T.PROPOSED ARMAMENTS COMMISSION. &apos;   &quot;T^rPPSFlEAOUB OF NATIONS,Note by the President of the Board of Education covering Report &quot;by the Representatives&apos; of the AdmifaTty&apos;,&quot; War&quot;Offico and Air Ministry.In the absence of the lord President of the Council it has devolved upon mo to invite proposals from tho: three Fighting -Departments for the constitution of the permanent Commission upon Armaments to be formed under the provisions of Articled of the Covenant of tho League of Nations...  It is, I think, desirable that the Cabinet 3hould approve the. attached Report of the Committee of representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, and Air Ministry before it is submitted to the. next meeting of the Council of the League, v?hioh is to be held in Rome on May 7th.I have only one observation to make on the Report, which appears to mo to be in all other respects excellent.     The Report contemplates that tho Commission upon Disarmament should be entirely composed of the technical officers representing the Fighting Services.     I taice the view, v;hich is I believe widely held abroad and more .particularly in the smaller Countries, that if the Armaments Advisory Commission is composed solely of soldiers, sailors and airmen,,the tendency will be rather in favour of an increase than of a diminution in the present standard of armaments and that, in consequence, it is desirable that there should be a civilian element On the Commission.Accordingly I would suggest that each Nation represented^ on the Council of the League should be invited to contribute Cue ^   civilian and three military members to the Standing Commission.&apos;(Signed)     H.A.L.PISHER,16th April, 1920.
.   ADMIRALTY *10th April, 19EO.Sir,I have the honour to inform you that, in accordance with your request, the representatives of the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry have met for the purpose of drawing up proposals for the constitution, of.the Permanent Commission to advise the Council of the League Of nations, as laid down in Article-IX. of the Covenant. * -.I enclose our Report, observing that we have come to agreement on the subject without difficulty and are unanimous in our proposals.I have the honour to be,Sir, .   .Your obedient Servant,&apos; (Signed)     ARTHUR 0ALTHORP3.Admiral representing the Admiralty.The Rt. Hon.Herbert A.L. Fisher, M,P, . &apos; L.L.D,.-,PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION *
PROPOSED CONSTITUTION OF THE PERMANENT COMMISSION_TO ADVISE THE COUNCIL&apos;, AS LAID DOWN IN ARTICLE IX-OF THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS,TITLE-i itARMA1MTS ADVISORY COMMISSION.&quot;The above is suggested as the most suitable, in that it conforms with the wording of Article IX, of the Covenant and indicates the &quot;advisory&quot; nature of the Commission.2. CONSTITUTION OF COMMISSION,..... .....-iiwmii &quot;limn .......     o&apos; . ......-..... ..................To consist of three distinct Sub-commissions, Naval, Military and Air,It is proposed that each Member of the League represented on the Council shall, If so desiring, have a representative on each Sub-commission.     In addition, when it is considered that any other Member of the League is directly interested in a subject brought up for discussion, a representative of that Member should be invited to attend all meetings on that subject and to take part in the discussions.5.&quot; CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMISSION.It is considered that the Commission Is competent to formulate its advice to the Council with one of its own members in i^he chair., and any idea of havingja civilian head of the Commission is opposed.    A civilian head woul&apos;. &apos;,ynly cause duplication of work by/adding
3.   (cont)    adding an unnecessary link to the chain, and would ^ not alter the advice given by the technical officers.Moreover, the fact of the Commission being only advisory to the Council implies that the responsi-bility for all decisions will rest with the latter.The Chairman should, be chosen alphabetically (French) in rotation from those Powers which are permanent Members of the Council. He should be -changed monthly, subject to the decision of the Commission that he may remain as chairman longer when necessary to conclude the discussion of any particular subject.4,     ACCOMMODATION OF COMMISSION,It is preferable that all Nationalities of the Commission should have joint office acconmoda-tlon in crde-r to facilitate the &quot;interchange of full and frank information&quot; undertaken by the Covenant (ArticleVIIi),    Any confidential . instructions and cipher messages which may be necessary should be sent through the diplomatic, or other national representative at the headquarters^ of the League,If it were decided that each nationality should have separate accommodation there would be a danger of losing touch with other nationalities, a tendency.to work separately in closed compartments and the possibility of engendering suspicion./5. PROCEDURE
PROCEDURE,......&quot;Lr&quot;  On the great majority of questions it will be convenient for the Commission to sit as three Sub-commissions (i,e. Naval, Military and Air) each con-si Bering its own subjects *    The chairman of the respective Sub-commissions should be chosen in a similar manner to the chairman of the whole Commission.In cases vdiere all throe Bub-commissions are concerned the reports should be forwarded to the Council by the Commission as a whole.Subjects concerning only one or two of the three Sub-commissions should be dealt with by the Sub-commission or Sub-commissioms concerned - in the latter case by the two Sub-commissions sitting jointly - and the report^ should be rendered direct to the Council. The Council can then decide whether they will deal with the matter on the Sub-commission1s report, or, if they prefer, they will refer it back to he considered by the whole Commission.when two of the Sub-commissions are sitting jointly their Chairman should be the senior of the two Chairman.secretarial the three Sub-commissions should each have a . permanent secretary, who should be provided, from the permanent Secretariat of the League,    \then the Commission sits as a whole the three secretaries should form a joint secretariat.Interpreters, translators, etc. should also be pro-vide d from the permanent Secretariat of the League./7 RECttMUDATIOHS
EMENDATIONS OF IMF COS*?.IISSION.As the Commission is advisory it is considered :  that its recommendations should not be governed by the voting of its members.    That is to say, if unanimity is not obtainable, majority a.,xi minority reports should be rendered, and it should be stated which nations are in .favour of, and which opposed to,.any recommendation.SIZE OF STAFFSIt would be undesirable to attempt to set up any independent staffs at the headquarters of the League. The permanent representation of each Member of the League oh the Commission should consist only of the senior Naval, Military and Air representatives and their personal atatffs, other staff officers being sent to the headquarters of the League as and when required.It is thought that the number of officers on each Sub-commission (see para 5.) permanently at the League Headquarters^ should not exceed four of any nationalityAs regards the British section of the Commission it is anticipated that the heads will require frequent personal consultations with their own Government departments, whose views they represent..     hen absent on such occasions their place will, however, be taken by a staff officer of adequate seniority..It is intended that the present head of the British Naval section of the Commission shall combine with his duties those of a Home Command.
9.   SALARIES. AND ggggggg-Tho salaries and expenses of the staff provided from the permanent Secretariat of the League should he charged to the League, hut the Governments concerned should pay the salaries, travelling and subsistence expenses of their representatives on the Commission and all the personal and technical sta&apos;ff which they may require.16.    REPRESENTATION 03? THE BRITISH EMPIRE,The British Section of the Commission should represent the British Empire, the necessary liaison with the Dominions being maintained in London.(Signed)     ARTHUR CALTHORPE.Admiralrepresenting the Admiralty.   .(Signed)     0.
