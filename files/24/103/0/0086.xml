While this unrest cannot be contemplated without concern, the divisions in the ranks of Labour itself, especially extremist labour, make concerted action more remote. While tho leaders are quarrelling among themselves the rank and file are in arms against their officials.   If the maxim divide et impera had been consciously applied it could not have been so successful as the state of disunion that has come by accident,The various Extremist Societies are very short of funds. The rise in the cost of paper and printing has hit them hard.The general strike in Ireland has been closely watched by British Labour.   A section of the railwaymen in England threatened sympathetic action. -The movement in France for internationalism among discharged soldiers is evoking some support from the more revolutionary ex-serv?ce bodies in England,   One of the proposals emanating from France is that ex-soldiers should destroy their medals and decorations.
SCHISM IK THE LABOUR WORLDAt no time in the history of the Labour movement have there been such disunion end jealousy as at the present.   The leaders are quarrelling about politioal and industrial questions and the rank and file are full of bitter complaints against,their officials.   Fortunately recrimination and distrust are most rife in the members of the extreme Left and when persons of this quality fall out the prospect is brighter for the great body of Society.The feud regarding the Third International is being waged in the Press and on the platform; Mr, Arthur Henderson, M.PM has used the columns of the &quot;Daily Herald&apos;1 to attaok the papers1 policy in this respect, while Miss Sylvia Panlchurst employs the same medium for attacking the Labour organisations.   The Independent Labour party is sharply divided, and a section of the Socialist Labour Party including McManue, William Paul and Thomas Bell, former editor of &quot;The Socialist&quot;, has broken away and demands separate representation at the &quot;Unity&quot; Conference. Messrs. Macdonald and Snowden are striving to maintain their leadership of the Independent Labour Party, but Mr. Snowden is critioised*for his attacks on George Lansbury and is accused of having injured the cause of socialism by letting the ruling classes into the secret of the quarrels between the various labour factions.&quot;The Socialist&quot; declares that &quot;the Independent Labour Party like Mahomet&apos;s coffin hangs between heaven and hell and belongs in its heart   of hearts to the Labour Party.....   It is not a true party .... it is a political &apos;dog&apos;s breakfast&apos; and such a diet the working class of this country can never digest.&quot;In the midst of this controversy Mr. Ramsey Macdonald
mm    2    w.has suddenly discovered that &quot;the block vote is against the true Independent Labour Party spirit&quot; and laments that &quot;one of the Third International Federations had gone the length of attempting to secure a block vote of all the branches attached to it.&quot;   This pronouncement is remarkable, in view of the well-known tactics of manipulation employed by the Independent Labour Party in the past.Underlying the quarrel about the International is doubtless the fear of events in Russia; ;,che leaders know that industrial conscription may be the death-knell of communism and even of nationalisation.An instance of industrial friction is provided by Messrs Thomas and Bromley; the latter is reported to have said that he will return the presentation from the National Union of Railwaymen of &quot;a gold medal and a vellum,, address in a  50 gold frame&quot;, and expressed his opinion of big leaders &quot;who are O.B.E.S and God 3:nows what,&quot;For some time sections of the railwaymen, as well as the miners and transport workers, have been attacking their officials.   In South Wales Frank Kodges has been the object of vituperation and the Transport Workers&apos; leaders are much incensed by the outbreak of sectional-strikes.   On the other hand some local committees say the&apos;Transport Workers1 leaders had no authority to make a general settlement without consulting them and are blaming the officials.Jealousy between workers in the different industries is immeasurable.   The railwaymen consider they are worth as much as the dockers, and unskilled trades claim that the dockers are unskilled; in any case they are inclined to regard the suggested dockers&apos; rates as a rainimimi&quot; &quot;The Law Clerks Federation and the&apos;National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs are taking action on this basis,&apos; and Lancashire miners are looking covetously at the spinners&apos;j: wages/.i
wages.   Even the police are reported to he weighing their new scale of wages against the recent advances in the scales of manual labourers.THE RAILWATMDiscontent with the last railway settlement is rapidly growing amongst the rank and file.It is reported that the London District Council of the National Union of Eailwaymen has decided to demand that the Executive Committee of the National Union of Railwaymen , should call the Triple Alliance together at once for vhe purpose of supporting the Irish workers then on strike. Mr. W. T. A. Foot is naturally the moving spirit who has been so prominent in connection with railway strike arrangements.Local District Councils are endeavouring to get Branches to &apos;go slow&apos; from Hay 1st to secure an increase of  1 a week.   The question is to be submitted to Branches and reported to a Special Meeting on April 21st with a view to a co-ordinated policy.Foot says that it is the duty of the Councils to promote discontent and that this is a grand opportunity.   He points out that if the Great Western Railway alone !go slow&apos; goods will be sent by the London and South Western Railway and so defeat their object.   All must &apos;go slow&apos; together, and the idea is in support of the Liverpool motion . repudiating the last railway settlement and suggesting a national &quot;working to Rule Book&quot; movement from.May.1st.A Deputation will wait upon the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; shortly to organise meetings on Irish matters; it is suggested that the Central Hall be used and meetings be held all over london to/
***     jj^i    **.to intimidate the Government.   In the London District Council, by 74 to 6 votes, Standing Orders were suspended to consider the matter,TBS COST 0?? LIVINGThe wave of discontent which always follows any increase in food prices is surging high at the moment. The additional cost of bread&apos; and bacon are the chief causes and too much stress casnot be laid on the importanc of the question.   There have never been such extensive demands for increased wages and the dissatisfaction may easily assume a revolutionary character.THE HOUSING question there is still considerable discontent regarding housing difficulties and some feeling is shown regarding the appeal for &quot;Housing Bonds&quot;.   The, workers consider that the State should finance- the housing schemes.- A National Conference of Labour Women is to be held in the Memorial Hall on April 21st and 22nd, when housing will be the main issue. 1There is a proposal to hold a Tenants&apos; International Congress in Prance this year and the Scottish Labour Housing Association has instructed Councillor David Xirkwood to collect data regarding Scotland.THE CO-OPEPATWill MOVEMENT   ....During Easter divisional councils of the Co-operative Wholesale Society were held at London, Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Melton   Mowbray, Cardiff, Bristol and H Workington.   Some 2,500 delegates attended these meetings which were devoted chiefly to co-operative business.The/
sThe proposal to levy income tax on Co-operative Societies has caused oonstornation in the ranks and every effort is being made to arouse indignation.rOOLWICH ;The election of to. Jack Mills, II.P., for Dartford, has created a vacancy in the office of Secretary to the All Grades Committees which is to be filled by Ex-Sergt. W. Cash, an Arsenal mechanic.   Cash is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World and was at one time notorious in the United &quot;States.   Ee is said to be unpopular with the unskilled and semi-skilled men.   In the violence) of his utterances he&apos; at least equals Mr. Mills; he was elected a member of the K.81 i onal Cour- c 11 of the National Union of - Ex- Serv ic e Men at the recent Birmingham Conference.Frank Oildon is still in the provinces but has written to Woolwich to say that-he will have the full support of-the National Union of Ex-Service Men in his demands on behalf of the discharged men at the Arsenal.Voting at the Arsenal is reported, to be. unanimously in favour of a strike on Mejy Day, but on April 11th Arthur MaoManus reproached the local workers, for lack of combination. He scid that the various departments refused to pull together and urged them to combine as the workers on the Clyde and in the North had done.   There they had organised so well that they knew exactly how much food was required for tht various towns and arrangements had been made whereby when the next strike occurred they could, if the South worked on the same lines, cause the revolution to be the real thing.The Post Office workers in Woolwich are.reported to be very dissatisfied and to be holding meetings at the Office of the &quot;Pioneer&quot;.PEELING/
mm     6     mmFEELING AMONGST EX-SERVICE MENIn view of the developments at the recent Birmingham Conference of the National Union of Ex-Service Men, interessees^ attaches to an article in which Raymond Lefebre, Vice President of the Republican Association of French Ex-Service Men, of which Henri Barbusse is President, states that the following French organisations have &quot;already adhered to the principle&quot; of the International of Ex-Service Men: the Republican Association of Ex-Service Men (100,000 members); the Working Men&apos;s Federation of Wounded Soldiers; the Ligue des Poilus; the League of Ex-Service Men of the Guise district; the Association for mutual Aid and Protection of the Wounded Soldier; the Association of War Widows and Dependents.The Franco-German Association of Ex-Service Men of Geneva, the Internationaler Bund of Berlin, the Lega Proletaria fra Mutilcti of Italy, the National Austrian . Union of Prisoners and Marines and the Ex-Service Association of Ghent are reported to have responded to the appeal for an International.   In Great Britain the National Union of Ex-Service Men and the International Union have signified their support.The first International Congress has been fixed for May next.   This International movement need not be taken seriously in this country for in addition to the usual , resolutions condemning war and advocating increased $ !^f;pensions, there is one emanating from the French Republican   1 Association which proposes tha,t,every member shall discard and destroy his medals.It is rsnorted that new branches of the National Union JL&amp;sjSof Ex-Service Men have recently been formed at Aberdeen, Leith, Bathgate, Cowoaddens, Clydebank, Edinburgh, Motherwellandl/
and. Wishaw, Carmarthen, Port Talbot, Skewen; Ferndale, Porthcawl, Bryn, Fulham, Paddington, Dulwich, Isleworth, Greenwich, City of London, Chepstow, Clithero, Exeter, Newcastle-under-Lyne, Raynham and Ipswich,   A new branch is also reported to be in process of formation at Belfast. The membership of the Union, however, as distinct from the number of branches, appears to he declining.The International Union of Ex-Service Men is preparing for a propaganda campaign throughout Ayrshire; the moving spirit is a man named M1 Clymont.   In Edinburgh the union is also active and efforts are being made to arrange a large meeting of unemployed sailors, soldiers and civilians.   The subject of the meeting is given as &quot;the solidarity of Ex-Service Man and Workers generally, to fight for the right to live&quot;.   The workers expect to establish a branch of the Union as a result of this meeting.There is some discontent amongst Bx-Service men at Newcastle regarding the appointment of a new seoretary to the local War Pensions Committee who is believed not to have served with the Forces.   Five hundred members of the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors, Soldiers and Comrades of the Great War have passed a resolution demanding an enquiry.I. G. Telling, the organiser of the National Union of Ex-Service Men for South Wales, has been places on the list of Parliamentary candidates of tho Independent Labour Party It is claimed locally that the interests of the two organisations are identical.iBXTBEMIST FINANCESAlthough the official balance sheets of extremist societies do not Show the subsidies received from foreign sources in the form of salaries or otherwise, they serve as/
m*$    3    **as an indication of financial instability.   The British Socialist Party shows a deficit on the General Fund for 1919 o-f  355. 5s. 6d., and thore was a loss of  620. 8s. 8$ on &quot;The Call&quot;.   Cash at bank and in hand was only  127, 14s. lid.   It is interesting to note that the literature sales for the year amount to  900. 14s. lOd, Expenses for lectures and meetings were  619. 14b. 5^-d. Only the subsidies received from abroad through Inkpin and Rothstein Keep the Party solvent.The balance sheet of the Central London Council of Shop Stewards and Workers1 Committee, which is audited by J. Thurgood, who is the secretary of the &quot;Social Soviet&quot; movement, shows an excess of liabilities over income of  23. 15s. 9d. for the last quarter of 1919.   Of this sum  20 is due to the organiser as salary; the cash in hand is  7. 10s. lid.   Since December last, the debt has increased to the sum of  50.Sylvia Pankhurst also has&quot;financial worries and wrote recently;-&quot;I have been looking into the accounts of the Peopled Russian Information Bureau and find that there is only about enough to keep it going for a week and as I am terribly pressed to meet expenditure of the press at present, I am greatly concerned.&quot;I really am most worried at the prospect at the moment. I wrote to Sweden but perhaps not so urgently as I might have done.&quot;We have shed so many one time friends with a little money that we do not find it so easy now as at one time to raise money and I am obliged to try to get every penny I can for the, press just now, so the prospect of the Bureau also being In trouble for money is alarming.&quot;MARCH OP BLINDED MIMy correspondents report, that the various contingents of blinded men who are marching are receiving much sympathy from all classes,   ^he men intend to hold a demonstrationin/
^ 9 - 313in Trafalgar Square on April 26th, end to march to Downing Street the following day.   They say that if the Prime Minister is abroad they will await his return.THE POLICE STRIKERSEx-P.C, George Wilson is still soliciting financial aid for the National Union of Police and Prison Officers.   He informed the Cardiff branch of the Electrical Trades Union that the various districts of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation had contributed  2,500 and the Executive  200 and that the Merthyr Miners had made a levy of Is. per member.MISS SYLVIA PANKHURSIThe obvious fatuity of her ceaseless activities is affecting Miss Sylvia Pankhurst.   It is reported that she is on the verge of a breakdown and that her actions and sayings are at times irrational.   Her present desire is to organise the working class   districts by streets, having Captains and Committees and to get the women especially to act together, to gain an influence with them and to spread amongst them a knowledge of communism and the Soviets.        ...She intends to give more attention to organising work,and to the preparation of literature for the London district, as she thinks that amongst the dockers and shipyards workers, as well as amongst other.sections, there is a field that should be cultivated. ART 0TBRISKOn April 14th the private residence and business offices of Art 0&apos;Brien,&apos;the President of the Gaelic League of London anfe one of the leading Sinn Feiners in this country, were &amp;*&amp;rched jnder a warrant from Bow Street. - It was known that he had been providing arms for Ireland and had been in correspon-dence on this subject with the organiser of the murders in Ireland.   Re seems to have been   expecting a raid, for nothing incriminating was found. S.H./
S. R. HAM SONOn April 10th Hanson, who was mentioned in my Report No. 9 of 26.6,19. for a conviction in respect of insulting words and behaviour in Hyde Park, was stabbed in the back bj a man who resented a speech made by him at Hammersmith. Hanson is a member of the Industrial Workers of the World   , and his assailant claimed that his speech was an incitement to revolution.The case has been remanded until April 22nd, as Hanson was too seriously injured to appear.THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;It is now reported that the lakh of rupees presented*to Tilak in 1915 on his 60th birthday was transferred by him to the &quot;Rerald&quot;.   The medium was the Home Rule for India League, and the money was ear-marked for propaganda work in England on behalf of the League.Mr. Lansbury is now making a tour of the provinces, speaking in support of Soviet Russia; his meetings in Scotland are reported to have been largely attended.   He visited Mr. Smillie and informed him that the Bolsheviks are anxious for him to visit Russia as soon as he is well.THE ANARCHIST PRESSAnarchists in the East .3a d are trying to stimulate their movement by the resuscitation of &quot;The Workers1 Friend&quot; which will be published monthly as the organ of the Yiddish section.   They are, however, handicapped by poverty and hope to raise money by means of concerts.&quot;Freedom&quot; is also in low water financially; the sales are reported to be decreasing every month.SOT/
SINN FEIN IN GREAT britain on April 11th some 5.000   poople attended a meeting of the Irish Eoonomic League in St, Andrew&apos;s Hall, Glasgow, and an overflow demonstration of about 1,000 was held in an adjoining street.   The speakers were W, Soars, editor of the &quot;Enniscorthy Echo&quot;, who has recently been active in Lancashire and on the Tyneside, Arthur Griffith,   Professor Boin Macnelll, J, H, Campbell, Soottish organiser of the Independent labour Party, and Seamus 0&apos;Keefe, the blind orator.   The speeches covered the usual ground, although tho chairman, Thomas Macdonald, announced that the Irish Republican loan had not so far received the necessary support,   J. R, Campbell stated that the Independent Labour Party was prepared to take any action Mr. Griffith might suggest to further the oause of Irish independence.   Thirty-four priests were on the platform, and a company of Sinn Fein volunteers were lined up and marched out of the hall &quot;with military precision.&quot;During the week all the Sinn Fein Clubs in the Glasgow area held memorial services for the &quot;martyrs&quot; of Baster Week, 1916.   At tho Thomas Ashe Sinn Fein Club, Anderston, a memorial mass was held for the execuied - Irish leaders. A body of about 500 persons wearing badges and Sinn Fein armlets attended.My correspondent states that Sinn Fein is making great headway in this area and is receiving the support of the advanced Labour and Revolutionary bodies.   Nine out of every ten Irishmen appear to be Sinn Feiners or supporters in one form or another of the movement&apos;, which is tho most active of all the revolutionary societies, and its adherents openly advocate militant measures to defeat the Government.- There/
There appears to be a c-considerable body of Clan-na-Gae men working at Leith i)stocks and friction exists between them and the Sinn Foiners in Edinburgh.   It is reported that hal a dozen Glasgow Clan-na-Gael men are going on a mission at an early date, some to Ireland and some to Manchester and Leeds.Cathal 0*Shannon, who has been living in London and was advertised to address meetings under the name of Conor Hayes, was arrested on a warrant on April 11th and handed over to an escort.During the week, meetings of the Irish Self-Determinate League and of the Gaelic League in London and the province!; have been well attended and it is reported that liberal subscriptions have been made to the propaganda funds.   The Sinn Feiners have recently been particularly careful about matter for publication and maintain comparative silence regarding the Home Rule Bill.It is said that between February 21st and March 31st Ithere was an increase of 1755 in the membership of the Iril1Self-Determination League.   Eleven new branches have been 1 opened: four in Manchester, two in South Wales and one eacl in London, Leeds, Liverpool, $forth West Lancashire and Tyneside during this period.   The total membership is 90lff and the branches number 98.   Branch contributions and donations during this time amounted to  340. 5s. 5d.The leaders of the Sinn Join Movement in London,\how are reported, to be quarrelling amongst themselves. E. OVTierney wishes to send out many members to distribute bills in order that they may be arrested and JIm advertise the movement, but his colleagues will have nothl* vl&quot;&apos;&apos;,% ffijjto do with this plan.It/     : I
It was stated recently at the Chandos Hall that de Valcra is going to Italy to make representations regarding the Irish Republic to the Vatican and to appoint counsels in the various towns.On April 4th the speaker at a Sinn Fein meeting in Wallasey strongly attacked the Labour Party for its attitude towards Ireland,My correspondent reports that Irishmen in Liverpool do not anticipate outrages locally as there are more Orangemen than Sinn Peiners in that district and the feeling between the two factions is very bitter.   The Irish Labourers are less active than the Post Office and &quot;ixcise clerks and the school teaohers.   It is possible, however, that in the event of a local dock or transport strike, the Irish element would act.During the last six weeks some four hundred Irishmen have arrived in Widnes from Ireland and have found work. My correspondent reports that the ebb and flow of Irish labour is usually in accordance with the employment available.An enthusiastic Irish demonstration was held at Bradford on April 11th; Father Blessing, a local priest, and Father (VDonnell, the Australian chaplain, delivered anti-British speeches.   The latter was particularly violent.IRELAND .A.general strike was declared on Tuesday, the 13th instant, as a protest against the continued incarceration of the men on hunger strike at Mountjoy Prison,   The National Irish Labotor Executive decided that the general protest strike was to continue indefinitely; at first it was to have been a strike only for 24 hours.   Tho strike was fairly complete in all parts except North East Ulster, where the majority of the workmen remained in.Captain/
Captain J. R. White has again been getting himself into trouble.   He was arrested for attempting to address soldiers on guard at Mountjoy.There has been no improvement in the state of the Provinces during the week.   The number of outrages reportei up to Friday amounted to nearly one hundred.   Ulster, however, remains quiet.   There were a few cases of burning vacated Royal Irish Constabulary Barracks in this Province but this appears to have been the work of two or three extremists in different localities and not the wholesale incendiarism by large crowds as in the other Provinces.Of the outrages reported the vast majority are directly due to Sinn Fein, though in the Province of Connaught these assume an agrarian rather than a-political] complexion and there have been a number of cattle drives and cases of firing into houses, due to agrarian motives. This movement, it is to be feared, shows a tendency to spread into the midlands adjoining Connaught.On the morning of April 9th,- three Constables cycling from Rear Cross to Newport for Petty Sessions were ambushei by a party of about 20 men.   Constables Finn and McCarthy I were shot dead.   Their comrade, severely wounded, managed I to reach Newport.There v/ere a number of other cases in which the polio were fired at and wounded in Carlow, Kerry and Mayo, but fortunately no lives&apos;were lost.In the&apos;South and West the police have as much as they can do to protect themselves and their barracks and there is little protection for life or property. Intimidat for political, agrarian and even motives of private rancoij is rampant. -Collections for the Irish Republican Loan, which isto/
to olose on let May, still continue.   In County Cork not 20$ of the money thus collected is said to have been willingly subscribed.A certain amount of extreme Socialist and Bolshevist literature is no doubt in secret circulation amongst the small Sooialist party and the extreme element of the , Irish Transport and General Workers1 Union, but no revolutionary speeches have been recently delivered as far as the police are aware,There are indications that many Sinn Peiners are getting tired of the movement, but fear of the consequence may preyont them leaving the movement at present,Pour men have been arrested during the past week in Dublin for having arms in their possession.Throughout the country 50 rebels have been arrested as being implicated in outrages or connected with the Irish Republican Army,On the morning of April 14th Detective Kells of the Dublin Metropolitan Police was shot in the street.   No arrest has yet been made.
