The Soviet System in Russia in Theory and inPractice.The fact that the Bolsheviks in Russia have succeeded in establishing and maintaining their system of government has caused considerable surprise and not a little uneasiness in many quarters. The fear that the social revolution which has been effected in Russia may break out in other countries is a perfectly natural one, especially in view of the persistent Bolshevik propaganda and of the social unrest and economic misery which at the present time prevail generally throughout the world.It may be worth while, therefore, to consider some of the causes which have contributed to the apparent success of Bolshevism in Russia, to examine shortly the work so far accomplished by the Soviet Government and to try to form a just estimate of the attitude of the Russian people towards the communistic rdgimc advocated by Lenin and his followers.]The Rise of the Bolsheviks.The rise of the Bolsheviks to power was the direct result of the failure of Kerensky to cope with the difficult situation which followed the collapse of the ancien regime. The Cadet Party which engineered the revolution of March 1917 was, like the party of the Gironde in the French Revolution, unable to direct the forces which it had unloosed, and Kerensky himself was a political adventurer who entirely lacked the courage and determination without which it was impossible to guide the policy of his country. The corruption and feebleness of the Czar&apos;s Government had brought the Russian armies to the verge of disaster and in order to insure the stability of the new Government it was necessary either to set to work to restore the confidence of the troops or to break off relations with the Entente and to come to terms with the Germans.Kerensky was incapable of adopting definitely either of these policies. He first allowed the discipline of the troops to be under-mined by the institution of the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Councils and by abolishing the death penalty for mutiny, and then decided upon the resumption of offensive operations against the Germans which ended in the catastrophe of Tarnopol. This fresh military disaster precipitated his downfall and led to the Bolshevik coup d^tat which wholly changed the character of the Russian Revolution. The deposition of the Czar was a political event of the first magnitude; it abruptly changed the form of government in Russia from an autocracy to a democracy. The defeat of Kerensky by the Bolsheviks was even a more far-reaching upheaval because it led to a complete transformation-mation in the whole social and economic life of the country.When the Bolsheviks overthrew Kerensky&apos;s Government, the situation in Russia was desperate. The army was in a state of almost complete dissolution, the central authorities had lost all control in the provinces, the State was almost bankrupt, the country was threatened with famine and industry was practically at a standstill&apos; Kerensky had been prolific in promises, but he had effected no seriousWt, 3239/S.P.D.

reforms. He had promised peace with Germany, social equality and the land for the peasants, but he had continued the war, raised a new bureaucracy from the Cadet Party and temporized about the disfcri-bution of the great estates among the peasantry.It is not surprising, therefore, that the cry that the Revolution was in danger was a popular one, and that the Bolsheviks who knew what they wanted and were prepared to carry out their policy without hesitation were able to overturn so easily Kerensky&apos;s feeble adminis-tration. Their leaders were determined men of marked ability, and possessed with an implicit faith in the cause which they advocated. They preached class warfare and from the first moment that they took over the reins of government they set to work to put in practice the principles of socialism about which Kerensky and his friends bad only prated and postured.Conditions in Russia favourable for the Bolshevik Revolution.All the conditions prevailing in Russia in the autumn of 1917 were in favour of the Bolsheviks. After the collapse of Czarism there was no longer any compelling force strong enough to bind together the various races which formed the Russian nation, nor was there any tradition or sentiment of corporate unity among the different sections of society of sufficient strength to maintain the existing social order against a determined attack based upon arguments which must always appear attractive to the vast majority of human beings who have neither the knowledge, nor indeed the inclination, to detect the fallacies which lie at their root. In no other country in the world was the ground so well prepared and ready for such a radical change of the whole social system as that advocated by the Bolsheviks.*The ignorance and poverty of the great bulk of the population, the comparative smallness of the middle classes, and the selfishness and lack of any sense of responsibility displayed by the majority of the nobility and land-owning class, all contributed to render easy the task of the Bolsheviks. They promised a new heaven and a new earth to the poor and downtrodden and it is not surprising that the latter were ready to accept the gift offered to them at the expense of an unpopular minority. They gave the country peace and the people were too anxious for the termination of hostilities to care whether or not the provisions of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk were a cause for national humiliation. The old order had been responsible for a disastrous war; the Bolsheviks gave peace to Russia. The old order was worn out and utterly discredited and so the doctrines of Bolshevism a gospel o  class warfare preached with fervour and resolution among the disorganized mob of defeated conscripts who were returning hungry and disillusioned to their homes-carried the* In an interview with Mr. Ransome, Lenin, when speaking of the prospect of a revolution in England, is reported to hare said: &quot; But certainly it would be much more difficult in England. Your big clerk and shopkeoping class would oppose it, until the workmen broke them. Eussia was indeed the only country in which the revolution could start. And we are not yet through our troubles with the peasantry. /See Six Weeks in Russia in 1919,&quot; by Arthur Ransome.
spirit of revolution and disorder into the farthest corners of the Eussian Empire.The Bolshevik Programme.The avowed aim with which the Bolsheviks began their rule in Eussia was the destruction of the Capitalist State, because their contention was that in any State where capital was predominant a small group of persons the landowners, manufacturers, bankers  must hold &quot; millions and hundreds of millions of town workers and rural poor in slavery and bondage; compelling them to toil, sweating them and throwing them on the street as soon as they become useless and worn out and incapable of being a source of further profit to Lord Capital, .... Every capitalist State is in reality one vast economic unjon. The workers toil-the masters enjoy themselves. The workers carry out orders the masters lord it over them. Such is the state of things called capitalistic, which the capitalists and their servants the priests, intellectual classes, Mensheviks, socialist revolutionaries and the rest of that fraternity, are inviting the workers and peasants to obey.&quot;*According to the Bolsheviks private property over land and the means of production are the two causes,which lie at the root of the tyranny of the bourgeoisie, and consequently they began their reign by issuing decrees for the abolition of the private ownership of land and for the transference to the State of all live stock and agricultural appurtenances, as well as of all banks, factories, railways and all other means of production or transport.!But the mere expropriation of the ruling classes was insufficient to insure the final triumph of the workers and peasants. It required a more complete break with the past to annihilate the former system of government, to shatter the bureaucratic and military machine, to establish the proletariat as the ruling class and to prepare for the communistic rtgime.In the constitution of the Soviet Kepublic it was therefore laid down &quot; that now, at the decisive moment in the struggle between the workers and their exploiters, there can be no place for the latter on any. governing body. The power must belong completely and exclusively to the working masses and to their true representative bodies, the Soviets of Workers&apos;, Soldiers&apos; and Peasants&apos; delegates.&quot;! In order to secure the supremacy of the workers and to render more effective the dictatorship of the Proletariat, it was further decreed that the workers alone should be entitled to carry arms and that there should be a complete disarmament of the propertied classes.Having destroyed the basic organization of the old State, the Bolsheviks proceeded to lay down the principles of their new State. They declared that the Bussian republic was a Socialist Community of all the workers of Bussia; that all authority within the republic* See &quot;Programme of the Communists&apos; (Bolsheviks),&quot; by N. Boukharin,published by the Group of English-Speaking Communists in Russia.t See &quot; The Declaration of Rights of the Exploited Working Class,&quot; confirmed by the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets in January, 1918, together with the &quot; Oonsti-tution of the Soviet Republic,&quot; ratified by the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, 10th of July, 1918.% See &quot; Constitution of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic,&quot; Part 1, Chapter IV, seotion 7.[2766] B 2
was vested in the entire working population of the country repre-sented in the Urban and Rural Soviets; that the supreme authority in the republic belonged to the All-Russia Congress of Soviets and during the time between its meetings to the Central Executive Committee; that the Church was separated from the State, the school from the Church, and that freedom of religious and anti-religious propaganda was assured to every citizen; that, in order to insure to the workers effective liberty of opinion, the production and circulation of all newspapers and other printed matter were free, and that the workers were at liberty to form associations among themselves; that it was obligatory upon all citizens to work on the principle &quot; that if anyone will not work neither shall he eat&quot;; and that the workers and poor peasants would be given free education by the State.Except possibly for the provision insisting that every citizen should work, it is clear that the Bolshevik programme must from the first have appeared extremely attractive to the average working man in Russia, and it is not surprising, therefore, that the political cry &quot; All power to the Soviets&quot; soon became a popular one, because, in theory at any rate, the Soviet system of government implied that the whole executive and legislative power was in the hands of the Proletariat.The Soviet System of Government.The only qualification which is laid down for membership to a Soviet is that every member must be a worker and not an &quot;exploiter&quot; of the work of others. A whole class and this the only educated class in the country is thus deliberately dis-franchised.The Bolsheviks claim that the Soviet democracy consists of workers organized so informally that for the first time in history the people as a whole are learning how to govern.* It is quite possible that there is considerable truth in this assertion because there can be no doubt that the Soviet system of government in which the electoral units for both local and central administration are committees of representatives of agricultural, industrial, military and other groups, does, in appearance at any rate, provide an opportunity for the mass of the population to take a wider and more direct share in the government of the country than is possible where the electoral unit is merely a territorial district. In this connection it must also be remembered that the Bolshevik Constitution provides a chain of Soviets, as the smaller Soviets send their delegates to larger Soviets, with the result that a representative from a factory soviet, a trade* &quot; The Socialist character of the Soviet democracy that is, our proletarian democracy in its concrete particular application consists first in this: that the electorate comprises the toiling and exploited masses; that the bourgeoisie is excluded. Secondly in this, that all bureaucratic formalities and limitations of elections are done away with j that the masses themselves determine the order and the time of elections and with complete freedom of call. Thirdly, that the best possible mass organization of the vanguard of the toilers-of the industrial proletariat is formed, enabling it to direct the exploited masses, to attract them to active participation m political life, to train them politically through their own experience. In this way a beginning is made for the first time to get actually the whole population to learn how to manage,&quot;  Lenin.
union soviet, or a military soviet may quite well find himself sent on as a delegate first to the sub-district or city soviet, then to the district soviet and then to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets. The Soviet system, therefore, would appear to open the way for men of talent, and it certainly is an important factor in the political education of the Russian people. Whether or not the system would work smoothly in a country where there was more real freedom than there is in Bolshevik Russia, in which class interests, political dissen-sions and local interests were allowed to prevail, is open to doubt. The Bolsheviks have solved these problems summarily by insuring that the whole political power is vested in one party. The elections to the Soviets appear to be more or less formal in character. There is no secret ballot, and the electors are either overawed by the presence of armed Communists or are made to understand that only the votes of Communists will be considered valid. In spite of these obvious limitations to freedom of opinion, it is tolerably clear that the Soviets are popular among the Russians and that even if the present Bolshevik rigime came to an end or had to modify its political ideals, the Soviet system of government, in some form or other, would remain. Meanwhile it is probably no exaggeration to say that it is to the institution of the Soviets that the Bolsheviks largely owe their retention of power.*Centralization   of   Executive   and   Administrative Authority.Although in theory each Congress of Soviets, formed from the various Soviets in cities, sub-districts and districts, has the entire executive and administrative authority within its area, and the All-Russian Congress of Soviets is the supreme repository of power throughout the whole country,! the Bolsheviks soon realized that, if they wished to maintain the influence of their Government, the central control must be made stronger. This central control has been secured by the institution of a Soviet of Commissariats, a body which is supposed to be subordinate to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, but which has the power to issue decrees that have the force of law, and is composed of the chief members of the Govern-ment with Lenin as its president. It is thus a sort of Executive Council. Members of this body are sent to all parts of the country as representatives of the Central Government, who work side by side with the local officials, and no doubt, to some extent at any rate, succeed in co-ordinating and regulating the work of administration.* &quot; Many peasants and a few workmen are dissatisfied with the Bolsheviks. No peasant, no worker, but is passionately determined to preserve the Soviets. And, knowing that the Government whioh would succeed the Bolsheviks, whatever its political complexion, would certainly suppress the Soviets, they are all ready to defend the Soviets.&quot; See &quot; The Socialist Soviet Republic of Russia: Its Rise and Organiza-tion,&quot; by Captain Jacques Sadoul.f A soviet is a committee of representatives of industrial, agricultural, military and casual groups. In a city there is a central soviet which is formed from delegates of the smaller s.oviets. In the country each area is divided into a government and sub-divided into districts and sub-districts. Each sub-district is divided into smaller districts. There are district and sub-district Soviets, and there is a district conference of Soviets formed from delegates from tho town and country Soviets in the sub-district. The city Soviets and district soviots have legislative powers within their own districts, and every city and sub-district has its own executive organization of commissariats.
The creation also of a Central Executive Committee of the All-Kussian Congress of Soviets considerably strengthened the central control of administration. This body, which consists of about a hundred members and of which Kalinin is president, is supposed to derive its powers from the Congress, but, as the Congress only meets occasionally and the Committee is always in session, the Committee is really the supreme legislative power in the country, inasmuch as its statutes have the force of law.Bureaucratic tendencies of the Bolshevik system of Government.At the, outset of their reign the Bolsheviks aunounced their intention of destroying the corrupt and all-encroaching bureaucracy which had been so powerful under the Czars. It is clear, however, that their cumbrous and complicated machinery of government could not be conducted without an efficient bureaucracy, and, just as Bepublican France adopted the Napoleonic organization of adminis-tration, so the Bolsheviks appear to have carried on the system of government which existed under the ancieti rSgime. Their intention, no doubt, is to employ in the future only members of the proletariat in official positions, but up to the present they have been obliged to employ the old officials in the same way as they have had to avail themselves of the services of the officers of the old army and of the old members of the secret police. Thus each department or com-missariat is administered by a number of ,paid officials who are non-political, but who are usually opposed to the Bolshevik rSgime and are only compelled by necessity to remain in their offices. The Bolsheviks have had no hesitation in establishing a police supervision over their bourgeois employees which explains to some extent the efficient working of their civil service. A system of espionage has been established by the Chrezvychaika   a secret police organization formed to check counter-revolutionary plots, speculation-lation, administrative offences and sabotage which has been one of the most effective means of maintaining the Bolsheviks in power. The excuse for the employment of this form of terrorism put forward by partisans of the Bolsheviks is that in a period of revolution and internal disorder a Government is forced to avail itself of every weapon which can counter the plots of its enemies. It is said that the powers of the Chrezvychaika will cease as soon as the counter-revolutionaries have been definitely defeated, but this does not alter the fact that the Bolsheviks have made use of a weapon which has always been associated with the worst forms of tyranny.Agrarian policy of the Bolsheviks.On the 25th of July, 1918, an enthusiastic foreign admirer of the Bolsheviks* had the courage to write that the land problem had been solved by the Soviet Government by the simple method of expropriating-priating the estates oE the Crown, of the Imperial Family, of the Church and of the landowning classes generally and distributing tliem* Captain Jacques Sadoul, who was at that time a member of the French Military Mission to Russia.
* &quot;The formation in the Tillages of the committees of the poor .... showed that the working classes of the towns, which united last November with all the peasants for the purpose of destroying the chief enemy of free, labouring and Socialist Russia-the landowners-had advanced from that problem to another much more difficult, historically much higher, and really Socialistic. This was to stimulate in the villages, too, the understanding that the great agrarian revolution, the November proclamation abolishing private property in land and socialising it, would inevitably remain a mere paper reform if the town workmen did not awaken to life the village proletariat, the village poor, the labouring peasantry, which constitutes the enormous majority, which, in common with the &quot; middle&quot; peasantry, does not exploit hired labour, and is not interested in such exploitation, and which, therefore, is capable of advancing and has now done so-from a joint struggle against the landowners to a joint proletarian struggle against Capital itself, against the exploiters who rely on the power of money. In other words, having liberated Russia from the yoke of the landowners, it has now proceeded to the creation of a Socialist commonwealth.&quot;-Lenin, December, 1918.among the poorest peasants, either to be cultivated individually by the new owners or collectively by the village. In December of the same year, however, Lenin, in a speech addressed to the &quot; First All-Eussian Congress of Land Departments of Soviets, Committees of the Poor and Communes &quot; was forced to admit that the agrarian policy of the Soviets was meeting with considerable opposition, and that&quot; the battle to secure the conquests of Socialist Eussia and the communal tilling of the soil would have to be fought step by step and yard by yard.&quot;The problem before the Soviet Government, after the expropriation of the landowners, was to arouse among the poorest classes of peasants the spirit of revolt against the exploiters of their labour and so to carry on in the agricultural districts the war against capital which had been so successful in the towns.  In order to awaken &quot; class consciousness&quot; amongst the labouring peasantry, therefore, committees of the poor were established in the villages throughout the length and breadth of Soviet Eussia, which were soon transformed into village Soviets charged with the duty of organising the new Socialist r&amp;jimc on the basis &quot; of all authority to those who work.&quot;* But the task of convincing the small peasant proprietors in Eussia of the desirability of a communistic ownership of land has not been an easy one, nor does it appear that even the poorest among the peasants have shown any inclination to surrender the land of which they have taken possession.  The rural population as a whole seems to have displayed a persistent opposition to the Bolsheviks not so much from any objection to the Soviet form of government as from a rooted objection to the socialization of land.    The incessant requisitioning of cattle and foodstuffs which the Government has been compelled to make in order to feed the population in the towns and the Eed Armies has also been a profound source of annoyance to the peasants and has probably been the main cause for the constantly recurring peasant risings.   The Bolsheviks at first apparently tried to force their system of communal farming upon the peasants, but, with their usual sagacity, they soon dropped this policy.   They admitted that the transition to the collective form of land holding, to communal tillage, to Soviet husbandry must be a gradual process. From that time onwards, therefore, their policy has been one of persuasion, and, whilst instituting wherever possible Soviet farms and communal tillage in order to demonstrate to the peasants the
advantages of scientific farming on a large scale,* they have ceased to use any methods of compulsion in the furtherance of their pro-gramme of land socialization.. It is quite possible that the Bolshevik contention is right and that, as the great estates have been broken up and private capital has been abolished, the only alternative to peasant proprietorship is some system of State ownership, or of State control. So far, however, the Bolsheviks have failed in their agrarian policy.   At the Seventh Conference of Soviets, held last January, the President of the Council of Popular Economy confessed that the peasantry were still opposed to the new land system, and that the antagonism between town and country was as strong as ever.  He stated that the peasants were unwilling to supply food for the industrial population and that it was only by threats of punishment that they could be induced to make the necessary deliveries.   The representatives of the local committees went even further and stated that the peasants hated the Bolshevik Commissars more than they used to hate the police officials under the old regime.  They informed the Conference that the peasants were determined to re-establish normal conditions, and to regulate the question of the ownership of property in their own way.  Meanwhile they absolutely refused to accept the paper-money in circulation as the notes had absolutely no value.The Nationalisation of Industry.Just as in their agrarian reforms the aim of the Bolsheviks has been the gradual transference to the rural Soviets of the development of the land and the general control of agriculture, so has it been their policy to give the management of factories and workshops to the workmen and to the various organizations of the Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Government. The supervision of factories by committees of workmen which had already been carried into effect before the October revolution, in order to prevent capitalists from making secret reserves of fuel and raw material, to check speculation, and to safeguard the interest of the employees, was considered by the Bolsheviks wholly insufficient in view of their policy of the expropriation of private property and the nationalization of the means of production. They realized, however, that to insure the smooth running of the wheels of industry and to carry out their scheme of making every manufacturing unit part of* The Soviet Government in J918 allocated the sum of one milliard roubles for agricultural improvement, the money to be allotted in districts where communal tillage was put in force.&quot; Our bounden duty is to direct the forces of applied science to the end that the most backward industry, agriculture, should be put on a new track, should be rebuilt and transformed from an occupation carried on upon lines of routine aud tradition .... into an iudustry based upon the results of experimental and- applied science. .... Those who think that after this war we can attain to a restoration of pre-war conditions, that wo can restore the systems and methods of farming which prevailed hitherto, are mistaken. . . . The war has created such appalling ruin that small private farms have now neither working caltle, stock nor implements. We cannot go on any longer with this criminal dissipation of labour. ... Life itself is bringing the toiling peasantry face to face with the question of passit.g to communal tillage as the only way of restoring the civilization ruined and broken by the war as the only way to escape from that darkness, ignorance and oppression to which capital has hitherto condemned tbe whole mass of the rural population.&quot;-Lenin.
a great whole, it was not enough that every large factory should have its own board of management consisting of workmen belonging only to that particular factory.*  Their object was gradually to build up &quot;a workers&apos; management of industry formed from the top of the ladder to the bottom,&quot; and to develop an organization of industry which should embrace all production and should be based upon a general plan by which an exact account might be kept of all national requirements and reserves for the benefit of the whole working com-munity.  The management of a particular factory in Soviet Russia, therefore, is not entrusted entirely to the workmen of that factory. The board of management is composed of workers delegated by trade unions of the special branch of industry by the Soviet of Workers&apos; deputies and by the local Soviet of Public Economy.  Above this hoard of management there are the district and regional Soviets of Public Economy, special committees which represent whole branches of production or commerce (e.g., the Centro-textile, Centro-sugar Com-mittees), and finally there is the Supreme Soviet of Public Economy, which in practice appears to regulate or to attempt to regulate the whole of the industrial life of Soviet Russia.There is no doubt that the Bolsheviks have done all in their power to increase the productive power of the factories, and they are never tired of preaching to the people the necessity for higher discipline, greater skill and harder labour.f&apos;  It is fairly evident from their recent mobilization of lahour that they have failed to induce the working classes to do more work and it is also clear that they have been obliged to call in the services of expert managers belonging to the bourgeoisie to supervise and to control the work in the factories.   Reliable reports with regard to the Iproduction in many of the larger factories show that the output has almost invariably been reduced, and that industry in many of them is at a standstill.  At the same time it should be borne in mind that when the Bolsheviks came into power the industries of Russia were in a deplorable condition; that until comparatively recently civil war has been in progress; that transport of commodities and raw materials has been almost impossible; and that Russia has been practically isolated from the rest of the world.  It is conceivable that, in a country where the people are as backward and illiterate as they are in Russia, if more normal conditions could be restored,* &quot; Some of the workers who are not sufficiently imbued with class-spirit, argue as follows: We are here to take our factory into our own hands and there is an end to the matter. Before, the factory was the property, say, of Mr. Smith; now it is the property of the workers. Such a point of view is of course wrong and closely resembles dividing. Indeed, if a state of attairs came about in which every factory belongs to the workers of only that particular factory, the result would be a competition between factories .... and .... we have again the old familiar picture .... capitalism would soon revive.&quot; &quot;Programme of the Communists (Bolsheviks) &quot; by N. Boukharin.t &quot; Economic improvement depends on higher discipline of tho toilers, on higher skill,.efficiency and intensity of labour and its better organization. In this respect our situation is especially bad, and even hopeless-if we should take tho word of those whoare frighteued by the bourgeoisie.....The Russian is a poor worker in comparison withthe workers of the advanced nations, and this could not be otherwise under the regime of the Czar and other renmunts of feudalism.   To learn how to work-this problem the Soviet authority should present to the people in all its comprehensiveness.....The possibility of Socialism will be determined by our success in combining the Soviet rule and the Soviet organization of management with the latest progressive methods of Capitali3m.&quot;-Lenxv, .
the Bolsheviks might be able to carry Out their policy of the nationalization of industry, provided that it could be made com-patible with the introduction of foreign capital and foreign competi-tion, without which any restoration of Russian trade would appear to be impossible, and provided also that their methods of education were successful in convincing the people that the adoption of their economic system would really ensure a systematic distribution of products and the abolition of unfair trade profits and speculation. Up to the present time, however, there is no sign that the Bolsheviks have succeeded in making popular their industrial policy. At the Seventh Conference of all the economic Soviets which was opened on the 7th of January, 1919, at Moscow, it was frankly admitted that the policy of nationalization had led to speculation and1 the rise of prices, and that production generally had diminished 70 per cent. &quot; I am obliged,&quot; declared Krassin, &quot; to say that life shows itself stronger than the Communist doctrine, and while people do not recognize that it is absolutely impossible to re-establish economic life under the Soviet regime, such is the fact.&quot; Lenin himself also had to confess that the collective direction of industry by all sorts of Soviets would not give the quick work which was necessary.* After three days&apos; discussion the Conference decided that the eight hours&apos; working day must be increased to one of ten or twelve hours; that the powers of the councils in factories must be greatly reduced; and that obligatory work must be seriously enforced upon all sections of the community.It is clear, therefore, that in their industrial just as in their agrarian policy, the Bolsheviks have had the courage to face facts. They have had no hesitation in reversing their whole social system in order to meet a grave emergency.Banking and Finance,It is undisputed that the Bolsheviks found the finances of the country in a state of hopeless chaos,f and that the civil war which lias been in progress throughout the whole course of their regime must in any case have made the confusion worse confounded. At the same time, it is doubtful whether a system of finance and banking such as that advocated by the Bolsheviks could ever be successful. An admirer of their policy has stated that the Bolsheviks assign to financial questions the importance they merit by subordinating them always to political and social questions a system of finance which seems to imply that the Bolsheviks spend vast sums of money upon their schemes of social and industrial reform without first con-sidering their cost or finding out whether they possess the means necessary.to justify the expenditure. Their object has been to make all banking the monopoly of the State and to effect a complete* &quot; It is necessary for us to agitate for popular economy and industry exactly as we hare agitated for the army. The principle of collectives musb yield to the regime of tho government of particulars; the development of popular economy will come to us,we shall lead it home.....It is necessary to work energetically to reduee the powersand duties of the factory committees and to give the direction to particular chiefs, who will naturally be Bolsheviks.&quot;-Lenin.t One of Kerensky&apos;s high officials, when asked to draw up a list of goods urgently required from England, is reported to have written, &quot; Above all, machines for printing bank-notes!&quot; See &quot; The Socialist Soviet Republic of Russia,&quot; by Captain Jacques Sadoul.
alteration and simplification of banking transactions by transforming the banks into an apparatus for uniform accounting and general book-keeping. Their intention is to abolish taxation as soon as the financial stability of the State has been secured by means, of its obtaining a complete monopoly of all trade and com-merce, but, until that desirable state of things has been established, they maintain that they have acted rightly in imposing forced levies upon the bourgeoisie and in exacting taxes from the people. * Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks their proposals for collecting taxes from the peasants have proved less generally popular than their system of levies imposed upon the capitalists, and the nationalization of industry and commerce has been a complete failure. The Commissioner for Finance, Kretinski, was forced to admit at a recent meeting of the Conference of Soviets that for the last year and a-half there was a deficit of 511 milliards. He stated that there were many milliards of roubles in circulation, that the value of paper money was decreasing every day, and that, if production were not increased, the value of such money would soon be less than the cost of making and printing the paper. The financial position of the Soviet Government, unless it can secure assistance from foreign financiers, would appear to be desperate.Education.The educational policy of the Bolsheviks, which is clearly laid down in their programme, consists &quot; in transforming the school from being the instrument of the domination of the bourgeoisie into an instrument for the abolition of the class division of society, into as instrument for a communist regeneration of society.&quot;! Although their avowed object has been to develop the propaganda of com-munist ideas on a wide scale in order to educate a generation of Russians capable of establishing the principles of communism, it is clear that during their rSgime much has been attempted to improve educational facilities generally. Education has been made free and compulsory for children of both sexes up to the age of seventeen; a system of pre-school institutions such as creches, kindergartens and homes has been established for small children, as part of the Bolshevik scheme for the social development of women; whilst in order to stimulate the intellectual development of the workers and peasants, adult schools and technical classes and new universities have been formed, and financial assistance has been given to assist proletarians to attend them. It is said that whereas formerly there were only six universities in Russia, there are now sixteen, and that* &quot; We are extremely backward in the collection of taxes in general and of wealth and income taxes in particular. The levying of contributions on the bourgeoisie-^ measure which in principle is undoubtedly acceptable and deserving proletarian approval shows that we are in this respect still nearer to the methods of conquest (of Russia) from the rich for the poor than to the methods of management, But, to become stronger and to make our position firm, we must adopt the last-named methods; we must substitute for the contributions exacted from&apos;the bourgeoisie steadily and regularly collected wealth and income taxes, which will give more to the proletarian State and which require of us greater organization and better regulated accounting and control.-Lenin.f See &quot; Programme of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) &quot; adopted at the 8th Conference of the Party, Moscow, 18th-23rd of March, 1919.
new polytechnics are being opened by the local Soviets in most towns. It is also said that the number of students in the universities has increased enormously in spite of tho difficulties of food supply, which prevent many would-be students from coining to the towns.* The number of libraries in Eussia has also been increased since October 1917.There is little doubt that the desire for knowledge has been awakened by the Bolsheviks among the.Russian people, and that they are endeavouring to the best of their ability to inculcate their political doctrines by means of the education of the rising generation as the most effective means of achieving their communistic ideals, fOrganization and Administration of Justice.By laws passed on the 24th of November, 1917, and the 21st of February, 1918, the Bolsheviks suppressed the old Courts of Justice, courts-martial, police magistrates, attorneys and barristers and replaced thern by a system of &quot; People&apos;s Courts&quot; appointed according to the maxim &quot; the judges must be elected from the working masses and only by the working class.&quot; There are local, district and regional peopled tribunals, the members of which are elected by the various Soviets, and there is also a Supreme Court of Judicial Control at Petrograd which has been created for the purpose of laying down uniform rules of procedure. The members of this Court are elected by the regional- tribunals. The ostensible aim of the Bolsheviks is to induce all workmen without exception to assist in the administra-tion of justice and &quot;to substitute the system of punishment by educational measures.! They claim that they have conceived a system of justice which is simple and avoids delay; that they have already effected a fundamental alteration in the character of punishment by the introduction of conditional verdicts on a wide scale, by applying public censure as a form of punishment, by replacing imprisonment by obligatory labour with the retention of freedom and by applying the principle of appointing judicial tribunals from among fellow workers of the accused person. There is not sufficient available evidence to show how far there is truth in these contentions, but it is clear that the Bolsheviks have not relied upon the &quot;W&quot;orkmen&apos;s Courts in dealing with opponents of their government. Extraordinary Commissions of Justice were set up in Petrograd and Moscow which exercised an unlimited power and were responsible for the wholesale execution of all enemies of the republic. It is perhaps not possible to judge a judicial system during the course of a revolution, but it is equally* See &quot; Six Weeks in Russia in 1919,&quot; by Arthur Ransome.t &quot; To satisfy the thirst for enlightenment of the Russian people, the free expansion, under the driving impulse of the government, of theatres and workshops or Red Army Clubs has been markedly noticeable. Every district of a great city, every little provincial town has its newspaper, its lecture halls, its lectures, concerts and dramatic performances, organized by the educational section of its Soviets,&quot; See &quot; The Socialist Soviet Republic of Russia : Its Rise and Organization &quot; by Captain Jacques Sadoul.J &quot; It is not sufficiently appreciated that the courts serve to attract all the poor to administration (for judicial activity is one of the functions of State administration) ; that the court is an organ of the rule of the proletariat and of the poorest peasantry; that the court is a means of training in discipline.&quot; Lenin.
impossible to approve of a judicial system which has a different code of laws for different sections of the population^Religion.The Bolsheviks began by decreeing the separation of the Church from the State and there does not seem to have been any general opposition to their policy, which was indeed the policy of the bourgeois democracy represented by the Government of Kerensky. The aim of the Bolsheviks, however, was the destruction of religion and this they have found a much more difficult task.f At first they endeavoured to close the churches and carried on a merciless persecution of the priests. They soon discovered that this policy defeated its own purpose, that &quot; offending the religious susceptibilities of believers &quot; led only &quot; to the strengthening of religious fanaticism.&quot; The Russian Church which was in many ways a corrupt institution and had before the revolution lost much of its influence among the people speedily gained strength as the result of persecution and showed an obstinate determination to use its influence among the peasantry against the Bolshevik Government.The Bolsheviks, if reports are to he relied upon, have now ceased to persecute the clergy and have allowed the churches to be reopened. It is said that the congregations are large and steadily increasing and that the Church which is now entirely supported by voluntary contributions has emerged victorious from its ordeal. If this is the case, the Bolsheviks so far have failed signally in their struggle with religion and it will be interesting to see whether their system of secular education will succeed in breaking the power which the Church has now regained in Russia.The Red Army.After the conclusion of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bol-sheviks were forced to reorganize the army in order to suppress the counter-revolutionary forces in Russia. The authority of their government was challenged and Lenin and his adherents, if they wished to maintain themselves in power, had to prove themselves stronger than their opponents. The real basis of the Soviet Govern-ment, therefore, is force, just as it is of any other Government. The Bolsheviks have proved themselves as ruthless and determined in the organization of their army as in all their other work.  They soon* The Bolsheviks before they came into power adopted the cry &quot; Down with capital punishment!&quot; &quot; Immediately they seized power they started killing off their opponents, and, when reproached with the contradiction between their precept and their practice, cynically answered,&apos;This is not capital punishment; it is fusillading.&apos; Tho official massacre, in revenge for the assassination of TJritsky and the attempt on Lenin&apos;s life, of some 3,000 hostages, who had nothing to do with those deeds or their doers, werelong after the &apos; abolition&apos; of capital punishment.....The Bolsheviks make no pre-tence of having stopped killing whoever is opposed to their policy.&quot; See letter of John Pollock in &quot; The New Europe,&quot; 18th of March, 1919.t &quot; The aim of the (Bolshevik) party is finally to destroy the ties between the exploiting classes and organizations for religious propaganda, at the same time helping the working class actually to liberate its mind from religious superstitions and organizing on a wide scale secular and anti-theological propaganda. See &quot; Programme of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) &quot; adopted at the 8th Conference of the Party, Moscow, 18th-23rd of March, 1919,
resorted to compulsory service, and, when they found that their troops lacked discipline, they had no hesitation in adopting in its full rigour the military code of the old Russian Army. &quot;When they discovered that they lacked leaders for their troops, they compelled officers of the old army to serve in this army, and it is no doubt largely owing to this fact that they have succeeded in defeating their enemies. At first service in the Red Army was extremely unpopular, especially among the peasantry, and at one time the desertions from it reached enormous proportions. Gradually, how-ever, esprit de corps was established. The men were well clothed and fed in spite of every difficulty, and the Array is now the real prop of the Soviet Government, for it is upon its discipline and example that the continuance of the Bolshevik regime largely depends.* Its energies are now being diverted from righting to productive work, and, if the Bolsheviks can succeed in maintaining its discipline and loyalty now that internal peace has been secuied, the present mobilization of compulsory labour may prove successful. Up to the present time there seems to have been no serious attempt at general demobilization, which tends to show that the Bolsheviks are either nervous of losing the support of the army in being or are afraid of allowing so many men to return to civil life when economic conditions throughout the country are so bad.Present Situation in Russia.The Bolsheviks have now succeeded in crushing their domestic enemies,. in making peace with some of their neighbours and in obtaining an indirect commercial recognition from the Allied Powers. In would, however, be a mistake to take it for granted that their success&quot; must necessarily imply that their system of government is popular in Russia or that in its present form it will become a perma-nent institution. Reports with regard to general conditions in that country and dealing with the state of mind of the people are now beginning to accumulate, and, although these reports are often conflicting,! it is possible to draw some conclusions from them which are probably more or less correct.It is clear that, for the time being at any rate, there is no party in Russia which is strong enough to oust the Bolsheviks from power.* &quot;The Eed Army represents at present a formidable power under the complete influence of the Soviet Government. It must be borne in mind, however, that it is not a Bolshevik but a national army, built up on strict discipline and capable leadership. It has all the former Eussian officers who waited for Allied help, but, out of sheer necessity, have been forced to join the Red Army. The Army is considered to be better than in the time of the Czar, as only capable and energetic men are selected as leaders.&quot;  From a recent report from Russia.t It is difficult to sift truth from fiction; it is even more difficult to distinguish between political propaganda and honest conviction, for almost all the pictures drawn of Russia to-day are either painted in too black or in too rosy colours. Thus the evidence of some of the British officers who have served in Russia and who have lost confidence in the manners and methods of the anti-Bolshevik leaders, and also that of the political tourists and journalists who have been the guests of the Soviet government-meht, would make any unprejudiced person believe that the vast majority of the Russian people are thoroughly contented under the rule oi Lenin and his adherents. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence to the contrary from sources equally reliable which goes to show that the rule of the Bolsheviks is hated by the people and that it is only by means of a reign of terror unexampled in the annals of history that they have succeeded in maintaining themselves in power. The truth, as usual, no doubt lies between these two extremes.
&apos; . - - &quot;The White Forces have been completely dispersed and the various parties, representing less advanced ideas of government than those of the Bolsheviks, lack leaders and are utterly disorganized.  It is also tolerably certain that the Soviet Government, although it may not be popular, is looked upon by the people as their strongest defence against the forces of reaction and against foreign interference.  The failures of all the anti-Bolshevik risings have been due far more to a fear that their success would mean the restoration of the old order than to any affection for communism felt by the people.  In other words, the determination of the Russian people not to lose the fruits of the Revolution does not mean their acquiescence in the policy of the Bolsheviks. On the contrary, it seems almost certain that the remnants of the bourgeoisie and the intellectuals and practically the whole of the clergy are definitely hostile to the Bolsheviks, and that the great majority of the working classes, especially the peasants, are far from accepting their communistic programme.  The Bolsheviks remain in power because they possess the energy and determination which is conspicuously lacking in any of the other parties in Russia, because they have obtained control of the whole machinery of government and because they have the support of the Red Army. They are faced, however, with a situation of great difficulty, as economic conditions in Russia, owing to the collapse of industry and commerce and the breakdown of transport facilities, are such that the country is threatened with absolute ruin.   That the Bolsheviks realize the gravity of their position is proved by the Herculean efforts which they are now making to remedy the evils which have been brought about largely by their own financial and economic methods.  They have tacitly had to admit the failure of many of their most cherished reforms and have been obliged to postpone indefinitely the realization of their ideal Social State.  They have not succeeded in converting the peasants to their communistic system of land tenure; they have been compelled to transfer the control of factories from committees of the workers to bourgeois specialists; they have failed to suppress religion; they have been forced to exact from the workers a twelve hours&apos; working day and to impose upon the Russian people a merciless system of compulsory labour; and finally they have had to resort to the old system of military discipline and the services of bourgeois officers in the Red Army.It is evident, therefore, that the Bolshevik leaders are opportunists who realize the necessity of adapting their policy to circumstances. They know exactly how far it is safe for them to try and impress their political ideals upon the people and, when they are convinced that they have failed to do so in any particular case, they have no hesitation in drawing back and waiting for some more favourable occasion to attain their object.Their strength lies in their political sagacity, their knowledge of the Russian people and their opportunism and adaptability. If they can succeed in making peace with foreign Powers and in restoring the economic life of Russia, there is no apparent reason why they should not remain in power, provided that they continue to act with discretion and do not attempt to force the whole of their communist creed too violently upon the people.  They stand as the champions
of the Eevolution. They have awakened in the people an interest in the political development of the country. They have removed many of the grievances which were prevalent under the government of the Czars. They are in a minority so far as their Communistic con-ception of the State is concerned, but the Bolshevik minority includes many of the ablest and most ambitious men in Itussia-it is led by an oligarchy which appears to have the driving force to carry out its programme and the political adaptability without which any Government based on force alone must eventually end in failure.His MAjBsn&apos;s Stationer?
