This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty s Government. ---------- &apos; 1THE CABINET,(I      Violations of the peace treaty by Germany.MEMORANDUM BY THE GENERAL STAFF. (Circulated by the Secretary of State for War.)1. Marshal Foch was invited recently by the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris to enumerate the several points which, in his opinion, constituted violation of the Peace Treaty by Germany.2. The most important of these points, reviewed by Marshal Foch up to the 10th March, are set forth in the Appendices attached to this Note Appendix A. Private letter of Marshal Foch to Field-Marshal Sir H. Wilson,dated 20th March, 1920 ; Appendix B. Marshal foch: letter to the President  of  the Ambassadors&apos;Conference, dated 19th March, 1920 ;and are summarized as follows :-(a.) Armament. Up to 10th March the Germans had not surrendered any portion of their war material. They claimed to have destroyed certain material and agreed to hand over lists; but no Allied supervision over the results of this reported destruction has been possible.The examination of fortified works to be retained by Germany under the Peace Treaty, and of artillery ammunition supplies for these works, has not been carried out owing to obstruction by the German Government.The inventories of non-German war material in Germany have been clearly insufficient and could not be accepted.(b.) Effectives. As reduction of the strength of the German Army to 200,000 men has not to be carried out until 10th April, no definite violation of the Treaty yet exists ; no progressive demobilization of effectives has, however, been attempted. On the contrary, the introduction of unauthorized formations, Einwohnerwehr, Sicherheitspolizei, &amp;c., have provided fresh cadres for the reception of trained classes released after the war.(c.) Commission of Control. The German Government have failed to make good the facilities guaranteed to the Commission of Control by the Peace Treaty. On the contrary, there have been numerous cases of ill-will and insult to A]lied officers whilst fulfilling their duties on the Commission.3. Other infractions by the German Government of the Peace Treaty, reported by Marshal Foch in separate communications (not attached) to the Ambassadors&apos; Conference, are: (a.) Export of war material. Violations of the Peace Treaty, especially as regards the export of war material co Holland, have been reported almost daily.(b.) Air and Naval Glauses. Cases of non-fulfilment of the Treaty are quoted.(B20/159)   100  4/20  H&amp;S  8094wo01545149
4. Doubtless the difficulties, as regards disarmament, experienced both by the German authorities themselves and the Inter Allied Commission of Control have been considerable, and have not been lessened by recent events in Germany.Still the fact remains that Marshal Foch&apos;s indictment is a very serious matter. Germany has disregarded the authority of the Supreme Council and is encouraged to do so by the indecision of the Allies as to whether or how they intend to enforce theThe result of this situation is that the Allies on the Rhine may be faced at any time by a formidable German army either under a reactionary militarist or under a Bolshevik militarist.General Staff,War Office,7 th April, 1920.
APPENDIX A.My dear Marshal and friend, I send you herewith 1. My speech delivered at my reception by the Academy, of no special importance, but followed by M. Poincare&apos;s reply, which is very interesting from a historical point of view.*2. My letter as President of the Committee of Versailles, drawn up in agreement with that Committee, in reference to the execution of the Treaty by 10th March.If you study this letter attentively, together with the collection of documents accompanying it, you will . see that  (a.) The disarmament of Germany has not been effected. The enemy acknowledges being in possession, on 10th March, of 12,000 guns, in addition to those belonging to the troops to be maintained, and to those which constitute the armament of the fortresses to be retained, which he estimates incorrectly at 3,000.Thus Germany still acknowledges possession of 16,000 to 18,000 guns, that is, a sufficient number to supply a strong army, superior to any that we could oppose to him for some time to come.(b.) The demobilization of the army is equally incomplete, for, owing to the institution of the Einwohnerwekr, the Sicherheitspolizei, the Reichswehr, &amp;o, they have cadres and units for the reception of the numerous trained classes returning from the war, giving a total which Avould rapidly place this army in a position superior to ours, as 1 mentioned above.(c.) As you see, the non-fulfilment of the Treaty with regard to these points of. the military clauses (as well as in those referring to aviation)&apos; places the Entente in a position of actual danger, which I consider it my duty to point out. Moreover, the declarations of Chancellor Bauer to the National Assembly are proofs of this, since they show that the programme of Kapp&apos;s Cabinet included measures of revenge within a short period.A Germany not disarmed, as at present existing, is a serious danger. We must, without any delay, obtain thu disarmament; that is my programme.Believe me,Ever yours, (Sd.)     J. FOCH.* Appendix 13,APPENDIX B.-Allied Military Committee of Versailles. Staff.-Marshal Foch,President of the Allied Military Committee of Versailles.To the President of the Ambassadors&apos; Conference.By a resolution dated 10th January the Supreme Council authorized the Allied Military Committee of Versailles &quot; to act as Counsel to the Allied and Associated Governments upon military questions connected with the execution of the Treaty with Germany.&quot;The 10th of March, fixed by Article 169 of this Treaty as the limit for the surrender to the Allied Powers of all German war material in excess of the authorized quantities, marks an important date in the execution of the military clauses. Consequently, the Ambassadors&apos; Conference applied to the Allied Military Committee of Versailles for information as to the extent to which the German Government has fulfilled, up to the date of 10th March, the obligations imposed upon it.Considering the execution of the Treaty as a whole, and without losing time over the military clauses of secondary importance enumerated in the attached collection T)f documents, I shall confine myself to demonstrating below the results obtained as regards the essential clauses of this Treaty : The disarmament of Germany.The reduction of the strength of the German Army.Up to 10th March the Germans had not surrendered any portion of their war material to the Commission of Control.They at first declared that the &quot; surrender &quot; was of no importance, that the Allied Powers were only concerned with the destruction of the material, and that they themselves were carrying out this destruction, without any supervision. Upon repeated protests from the Commission of Control, they decided, only a few days before 10th March, to hand over lists of the material which they claim to have destroyed, and of that still awaiting destruction. But, owing to the delay with which these lists were rendered, it was not possible to&apos; verify them, and the Commission of Control had not obtained possession of any material.In fact, by 10th Marcht one of the essential parts of the Treaty had been violated. Germany was not disarmed within the period of 2 months which had been fixed.Paris,(4 bis Bd. des lnvalides). 19th March, 1920.
As regards the reduction of strength of the German Army, in accordance with Article 163, the reduction of this Army to a strength of 200,000 men is not, it is true, due to be completed before 10th April, therefore no accusation of actual violation can be made on this subject. But it is obvious that, in order to attain the required figure by 10th April, the German Government should have carried out a progressive reduction of its military forces from the time upon which the &apos;lreaty came into force.Now, by 10th March, nothing had occurred and no diminution of these establishments had been effected. On the contrary, the Germans were increasing. their so-called police forces, and endowing them with a military organization distinctly forbidden by Article 177 and in flagrant contradictiou to Article 178, which &quot; forbids any measure of mobilization or leading to mobilization,&quot; they have established real reserves, under the names of Einwohncrwehr and Zeitfrciwillige.By its Resolution of 1st December, the Supreme council had already warned the German Government that these formations were distinctly opposed to the Treaty, and that they must be disbanded on its coming into force. Not only have these formations not been disbanded, but they have been constantly increased up to 10th March.The German Government has made no reply to the repeated reminders of the Commission of Control. A secret instruction, which came into our possession, proved, moreover, that the aim of these organizations  to be concealed from the Commission of Control was the re-establishment of German military unity.Thus, not only has the German Government failed to take suitable measures to conform with the clauses of the Treaty within the required period, but in spite of the protests of the Supreme Council and the Commission of Control, it has clearly violated them.As we see. the provisions of the Treaty, whether concerning disarmament or the reduction of strength, have, up to the present, remained a dead letter.The warnings or injunctions addressed by the Supreme Council, or by the Commission of Control have remained ineffectual. The opposition of the representatives, of the German Government to the working of the Control has been constantly increasing, from the coming into force of the Peace Treaty up to 10th March, culminating in the violent attacks mentioned in the letter of 12th March, No. 405/1, addressed to the President of the Conference of Ambassadors.On 13th March the military coup oVEtat took place which obliged the Commission of Control to suspend all operations.As regards the air clauses, the exportation and destruction of aircraft material with reference to which several memoranda were addressed to the German Government by the Supreme Council in 1019 -have continued, and since 10th January, 1920, air forces have been employed upon various pretexts, aircraft material has been manufactured and exportation to varions neutral countries has been notified.In view of these facts the Allied Military Committee of Versailles must take cognizance of the fact that the German Government, owing either to weakness or to connivance, has violated the Treaty in its essential clauses, and reports accordingly to the Conference of Ambassadors.(Sd.)
