J   &apos; Tblr T.....r,    -      -of,1,-,, j.......,.;oh.u       yv/,        ,SECRET.     For the Information of &amp;embers of the Board.WEEKLY APPRECIATION OF MATTERS OF NAVAL INTEREST,     No. 69.iFor the week ended 10th April. 1920.BALTIC.Senior Naval Officer, Baltic telegraphed on 9th April that he was making enquiries as to ice conditions at Eelsingfors with a view to visiting the Gulf of Finland next week.     Orders have now been sent that no visits are to be paid to Finnish Ports or other ports in the Gulf of Finland pending further instructions.Repatriation of British.The 5th batch of British for repatriation is due to reach Hango on 14th April, but as space on board DONGOLA does not permit of this batch being separated from the previous ones, it will be necessary for quarantine to be carried out at Terijoki, and the batch will therefore not be ready to sail until 28th April at the earliest *Orders have therefore been sent for D0NG0LA to sail for Southampton as soon as possible.    She will be sent back to Baltic for the 5th batch.H.M.S. &quot;VOLUNTEER&quot; will escort D0NG0LA as far as Copenhagen,Esthonia*Professor Piip, Head of the Esthonian Delegation in London, states Esthonia hopes later to create a small navy for coast defence purposes, and asks whether an application for British advice and assistance would be sympathetically received.Baltic Trade.The Bolshevik Representatives have arrived at Copenhagen. Mr-. Wise and five members of Economic Council left England on 5th April for Copenhagen,   Visas for Bolshevik Delegation are valid for 14 days, but period will be extended if desired.. Finland,The Constitutional Laws Committee of the Diet has approved the Bill to confer self-government on the Aaland Islands.The War Office has decided to withdraw the East FinnishMission.Baltic States Peace Situation.Chicherin has wired stating that it is exorbitant to demand evacuation of Petchenga and Karelian town previous to armistice, as this would imply that Russia was&apos; a defeated country.   Soviet has $   since further stated that they are willing to commence negotiations - on 10th April to conclude peace and immediate armistice; they refuse to evacuate Petchenga and Sahnijaervi, but consent to abstain temporarily from occupation, of Karelian towns.Negotiations will probably take place at Rajajoki. Finland has informed Poland that they wish to conclude peace jointly with Poland, but if Finland, on political grounds, internal or external, finds herself compelled to make peace without awaiting result ofRusso-Polish/
Russo-Polish negotiations, Finland, reserves to herself the right of concluding separate peace, keeping Poland informed of negotiations!Lithuania *Soviet replied 3rd April that they accept proposal to commence negotiations, and suggest Moscow and 15th April as place and date *North Russia.In repljr to further requests to assist the icebreaker &quot;S0L0V2I B0DIMIROVITCH&quot; the Foreign Office has replied that it would appear that the best moans of affording relief is in Soviet hands. The &quot;Times&quot; reports 8th April that the icebreaker &quot;KUZMA MINIM&quot; now at Tromso, Norway, will be utilised for relief purposes.     In a,  W/T message dated 8th April, the Bolsheviks state that an icebreaker has returned to Archangel after a cruise bringing 15,000 seals.    This proves that their W/T is either lying or that their frantic appeals are purely propaganda tactics.MEDITERRANEAN AND BLACK SEA.Foreign Office have been Informed that the Admiralty concur in the proposal of the British High Commissioner at Constantinople that Allied men-of-war should be stationed at Turkish Coast towns with a view to giving some security to the Christians in the interior. The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, has been instructed to make the necessary dispositions accordingly.   On 4th April it was reported that the situation in Constantinople remains quiet.General Denikin and his Chief of Staff, General Romanovski, were received at the Russian Embassy, Constantinople on their arrival on 5th April.   General Romanovski was assassinated there by some persons unknown.General Denikin and his family are being sent to Malta in H.M.S. &quot;MARLBOROUGH&quot; en route to England.Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean proposes the following naval action in the event of the refusal of Turkey to sign the Peace Treaty :-(a) The destruction of the Turkish fleet and all nasral war material - the closing of the college and barracks, and disbanding of the personnel.(b) The seizure and, occupation of all Turkish Islands.(c) Control of the;important Turkish seaports in conjunction with the military.The presence of Allied men-of-war will in any case be necessary at most of the seaports. a&amp;   non-Moslem communities press to the coast in time of danger.   With naval support and aircraft it would not be necessary to provide large garrisons.The British High Commissioner, referring to reports that the Peace Treaty Is again to be delayed, and that the United States Government is pressing for the expulsion of the Turks from Constan-tinople, represents that further delays are most inadvisable.   He considers that all the advantages of the success which,has been achieved by the occupation of Constantinople will thus be lost.   The Nationalists have received a severe blow? and it is most desirable that the present opportunity for the presentation of the Peace Terms should be seized.has beenIf the peace terms are as drastic as/foreshadowed, the necessity for the use of force cannot be avoided, and it is   there -fore very desirable that action should be taken when the   Nationalists are discouraged and disorganised. ,   If the terms, on the other hand,arc/
are to be ameliorated it will $till be possible to&apos; form a moderate bloc round the Sultan, who will accept them rather than plunge Turkey into another war, which could only end In the complete ruin of the country *The most essential features, if the latter policy Is adopted, would be to give satisfaction to the Turks in regard to Smyrna and Adrianople.The Allied High Commissioners consider the objections to the resumption of trade between Turkey-and Germany outweigh the consideration of stimulating German exports in order to facilitate &apos; reparationiAdmiral de Robeck points out that Bulgaria has ratified the Treaty of Peace, and. the Commissioners are recommending that ihs she should be allowed to export to Turkey cereals, meat, etc., of which she may have a valuable supply in certain circumstances.General Franehet dFEsperey has been informed that W.O. consider Thrace within his zone, and has replied that he considers the Conventions regulating the Inter-Allied Command in Turkey as still in force.The following views of our High Commissioner are concurred in by Canmander-in-Chief, Mediterranean and G.OoET, in C. Constan-tinople.     It is almost inevitable that following the announcement of decisions assigning Turkish Thrace or Smyrna to Greece massacres will occur in the Interior.   The Allies at Constantinople are entirely powerless to prevent these, and the only Allied force available in Asia &quot;Minor Is the Greek Army of Occupation, whose advance would infinitely increase the danger.If drastic terms, including in particular (l) the main-tenance of Greece in Smyrna and cession to them of Thrace, (11) the extension of an Armenian State into Asiatic Turkey are to be imposed the only certain way to protect the Christian minorities is a military occupation by Allied forces other than Greek   of the whole of Anatolia and Thrace. &quot;&quot;As this is imposeible the protection of Christian minorities in Asiatic Turkey is impossible.   Much could be done by&quot;stationing      &apos; men-of-war at all coast towns, thereby attracting Christians to where they could be more easily protected, and fed than in the interior.Another measure suggested is to announce that the Allies themselves will punish any officials guilty of massacres or failure to stop them.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, considers the presence of Commodore Fitzmaurice at Smyrna necessary until the future of that town has been settled.Measures to enforce Peace Treaty.The measures necessary to enforce the Peace Treaty with Turkey have been considered at Versailles and the following recommended :-1. To maintain and consolidate the present occupation.2. To take possession of tho territories Turkey will have to cede in Europe and western Asia Minor.3. To control the railway systems of Anatolia, i.e., from Eaidar Pasha to Alexandretta, and eventually the extension to Angora.Forces available for these purposes in the areas concerned are 19 divisions. 9 of vhich are Greek.if/
wanted.Fiume.The latest available information in tho possession of the British Military Mission at Abbazia is to the&apos; effect that d&apos;Annunzio is expected to declare a Republic of Plume at any moment, and is only hesitating as to the territory he wishes&apos; to include and the action he will take subsequently.Tlie Head of the Mission is sceptical but thinks something may be browing.   D&apos;Annunzio has apparently exho/usted his popularity, as well as the commodities of life, at Fiume.Danube.Captain J. P. Warton, CM., CBE., RN., Senior Naval Officer, British. Naval Forces on the Danube, took over command of &quot;LADYBIRD&quot; at Galatz on karch 18th.Crimea*The evacuation of Russian troops from the Black Sea Coast to Crimea continues.On 1st April a counter attack repulsed the ^dissapointed near Perekop.   On the Chongar front a Red Armoured train was repulsed.On 3rd April it was reported that the Reds had mounted guns on the Taman Coast opposite Kerch and heavy fighting was in progress *   On the Perekop front the Whites had occupied Preobrajenka capturing 2 guns and. prisoners.The Bolsheviks are reported to be concentrating for an attack on Perekop and Chongar.   They have mounted guns on Taman Peninsula, opposite Kertch, and command the Straits.   The Bolsheviks have issued a proclamation to the Officers and bluejackets of the Black Sea Fleet that if they surrender ships intact, a full amnesty will be given.   The Commander-in-Chief, reports that stops are being taken to prevent Russian warships falling into enemy hands in connection with Russian proposals previously reported of removing all ships of value to Ismid and Varna, but the above proclamation will make the problem more difficult, as even the average mind perceives that&apos; the end has come.General  range1 lias given his views of tho situation to Commander-in-Chief and General Keyos, which are briefly as follows :-That since H.M. Government propose to withdraw all assistance if struggle be prolonged, then Great Britain is morally responsible for the&apos; safety of the Volunteer Army and refugees in Crimea.   That negotiations should be undertaken by H.M. Government with Bolsheviks for amnesty for all ranks, that they should, be allowed to return homeand/If Armenia is to be considered, 8 more&apos; divisions areIt is considered undesirable to increase the Greek forces.4. Naval forces to be available to assure a hold over the Turkish islands and to control, in co-operation with the military, the ports of :-Trebizond Karesund Mudania      Sillvri.Risen Sinope PandormaSamsun Ismid  &apos; RodoSto5.&apos;Blockade of the coast of Asia fcinor is set aside as inefficacious and difficult to work and likely to Increase the present precarious situation regarding revictualling the neighbourhood of Constantinople.
and guarantees given that they will not bo molested or terrorisede That a refuge shall be found for all those who consider themselves dishonoured in accepting amnesty from the enemy.   Finally, that when agreement is reached, two months should elapse before the Crimea is turned over to Soviet to enable all dispositions to be carried out, and that during this period Allies should continue to give all necessary supplies for Army and population.   The Commander-in-Chief and Generals Bridges -and Keyes have wired, differing only in detail, that in view of situation H.iu. Government should take all necessary steps to safeguard Crimea until fi al negotiations are completed with Bolsheviks as to future of Volunteer Army and Crimea.A small Mission under General Percy remains in Crimea which will be reduced to a minimum consistent with efficiency. General Percy asks for free hand to act as he considers best to meet new situation.Refugees.This question is now temporarily settled pending decision as to future of Crimea and action which will then have to be taken.Caucasus .The Bolshevik line runs in vicinity of Tuapse, thence along foothills South of Vladikavkaz, 15 miles South of Grozin and from there to about 15 miles South of Petrovsk.     There has,been a xxi rising at Berbent.   Up to the present there is no indication of Bolshevik advance across the Caucasian chain.Telegraphing on 6th April, C-in-C reports that from information obtained from Red prisoners, it appears likely that after completing operations against Volunteer Army at Tuapse, Red Army will undertake operations against Georgia and Azerbaijan.   C-in-C, asks whether, In the event of Bolsheviks marching by coast road, it would be in accordance with Allied policy to stop them.   He has been Informed that if they attempt to use the road to Batoum measures should be taken to stop them.General hjlne wires that situation in Batoum is becoming more critical daily.   The threat of Bolshevik advance is disquieting. Italian and French troops of Inter-Allied garrison show no signs of materialising.   General Milne therefore asks that following points may be made quite clear :-(l) Are Allies going to back Trans-Caucasian Republics with material f(2) If s6, when and whence can this material be delivered In time to be of use ?(3) Are Allied going to try to prevent advance of Reds int&quot; Georgia by force of arms ?(4) Do allies intend to defend Batoum only ?It is further pointed out that if Caucasus be overrun by Bolsheviks, direct touch will be made with Turkish Nationalists, wit-consequent danger to Persia and elsewhere.   If we decide to hold Batoum, then Georgia will mere probably be against them with us. Already they are talking of stopping all railway communication with the town.   The food question in Batoum is acute, and it is absolute!; essential that supplies should, be sent before 15th April.About 3,000 of Brdcli1s troops have arrived at&apos;Poti where four Russian Volunteer ships have assembled to embark them. TheGeorgian /
Georgian Government have^rcfused to release these ships and have stated that any action to effect their release taken by British men-of-war would be considered as a hostile act. C-in-C has asked ivir. V/ardrop for an explanation of the Georgian attitude.On 9th April it was reported that Georgia had agreed to release these ships.CASPIAN.The situation in the Caspian is not clear.   On 2nd April G.O.C^-Mesopotamia reported arrival at Snzcii of 13 ships and 3 barges of Volunteer Fleet, but that 11 ships and 2 barges had left, the remainder leaving on 3rd April.   The Fleet had probably gone to Baku to negotiate with Azerbaijan.     Admiral Sergeiev is agreeable to hand over Fleet to British, but very averse to handing it over to Azerbaijan or Persia.   On 8th April it was reported that 2 ships, the &quot;AUSTRALIA&quot; and &quot;CHASOVOl&quot; had gone over to the Bolsheviks at Krasnovodsk.   On 9th April Captain Busben, who has relieved Admiral Sergeiev, arrived again at Enzeli with 15 ships and has accepted fu3,l terms laid down.   Landing has been suspended pending further orders.   General Dratsenko with his troops, who were reported to have been disarmed at Baku arid sent to Elisavetpol, is now stated to be making for Enzeli for repatriation.Two Naval 4-inch guns&apos; which have arrived at Basrah are being sent up to Enzeli. Ivir. V;ardrop reports 3rd April that two Bolshevik destroyers have been seen in the Caspian.&apos; SIBERIA.On 1st April the last units of the American Expeditionary Force with General Graves and his staff left Vladivostok for the United States.     There is no news as to the progress of evacuation, but Vlaclivostock is reported to be still very congested.ITALY.The Naval arsenals are to be divided into two groups, one for the building and repairing of merchant shipping, the other to carry on building and repairing for the navy.   Spezia is to be purely naval, Pola partly naval and partly mercantile, being already provided with building yards, slips, dry docks, workshops etc., Venice, Naples and Castellamare will be mercantile.ROUMANIA.Captain Bowring, D.S.O.,- R.N., left London on 30th March for Bucharest in response to a reqiiest from the Rumanian Government for an officer to study and advise upon the Rumanian naval require-ments and to discuss the various offers of naval assistance made by this country.Peace Pourparlers are continuing between Rumania and the Soviet Government of Russia.   An unconfirmed report has however been seen to the effect that the Bolsheviks have decided to take the offensive against Rumania in the Spring.MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE *Irish Unrest.Carriglee. Coastguard Station was raided at 0115 .28th March and 4 rifles, 2 Morris Tube rifles, 8 revolvers and 2 Very!s Light pistols were taken.     About 20 men carried out this raid. The arms had been under water for 14 months and are not likely to be of much use.ADMIRALTY, S.W.I.15th April, 1920..   ft
