(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.)Prime Minister*On December 10, 1919, the Cabinet sanctioned the publication of the First Volume of the Official Naval History, and decided that the question of publishing subsequent volumes should be postponed for further consideration after the publication of the ^irst Volume.At the Conference which recommended this course to be followed, it was agreed that the question of continuing publication should depend to a large extent on the reception by the Press of the First Volume.This volume was published on March 11, 1920, and has now been reviewed by all the leading London and ProvincialPapers *From the extracts from Press Notices attached it willbe seen that its reception is all that could be desiredand to quote Mr. A.H. Pollen in the &quot;Universe&quot;:,fIt is not the Author&apos;s business to raise contro-versies but to quiet them, and read in the light of his mission the book is admirable.&quot;The sales to faster (three weeks) amounted to 2, 50scopies.The Second Volume of the Naval History can be got ready for Press in a very short time, and It is desirable that a decision should be now reached on the question of further publication.(Sd.)

if&apos;HISTORY OF THE GREAT WAR, Based on Official documents.ilAVAL   OPERATIONS.vol. I. ---by---Sir Julian S. Corbett.PR*l&apos;SS   NOTICES.&quot;It will generally be admitted that no better choice could have been made than that of Sir Julian Corhett to prepare the Official History of Naval Operations during the Great War;   and If any doubt could be entertained on that point, the choice has been abundantly justified by the instalment of the work now given to the world in this masterly volume ......     In our judgmentSir Julian has accomplished his extremely difficult task with very great skill.    The difficulty of the task is, indeed, in large measure concealed by the skill of its accomplishment,   No naval historian has ever had to paint on so large a canvas.   None has ever had so intricate and far-reaching operations to describei,&quot;-The Times.&quot;When he was commissioned to write a history of the naval operations of the great war, he must, however, have found himself confronted with a ser5.es of problems as embarrassing In their complications as they were delicate.   The triumph   that word is not too strong - which he has achieved in his first volume, lies In the atmosphere of detachment which he has created, and which pervades every one of the 436 pages.   The reader might, indeed, be beguiled into the belief that the events described happened scores of years ago, and that Sir Julian Corbett has in fullness of time gathered together all the official documents, and then in leisurely fashion balanced statement against statement, and Admiralty telegram against Admiralty telegram, in order to be assured that he was doing justice to the great men who had already been gathered to their fathers It is full of secrets,being based upon documents which were jealously guarded while the war was in progress and with which the majority even of naval officers are not familiar.    The pen of the historian is not that of an official apologist, but of a writer who is the outstanding contemporary student of naval history, and accepts full personal responsibility for the form and character of the narrative, as well as for the opinions expressed ......     In the body ofthe volume are printed a number of maps, plans and diagrams, and It is accompanied by a case containing eighteen other maps and charts.     It may be doubted whether any history has ever appeared with so many^aids to the. reader as this one dealing with the naval operations during the early months of the war.   But, never-theless, it is to be obtained at a price placing it within reach of all who would know the truth about the events which occurred between the opening of the war and the battle of annihilation off the Falklands.   - Daily Telegraph.&quot;It Is in many ways a remarkable production.   No one hence-forth can pretend to realise what the naval operations were, still less to dogmatise concerning them, without first mastering this book ........      Sir Julian Corbett1a industry,skill and mastery of subject in a very great and complicated task are beyond praise.       He has amassed and mad^ available a vast array of matter culled from Innumerable documents
documents, and his book has permanent value.   *   .   .   . .    ItIs published i&quot; excellent format and with its admirable maps, at a price unparalleled in its modesty.&quot;&quot;-   Daily Ghrpnlcle.&quot;No man save Sir Julian Corbett could have written the, official history of the naval side of the war with the same scholarly thoroughness and .romantic interest.&quot; --  ftA.ly,^ew.%?,&quot;In accepting the task of writing the hia tory of the naval operations of the war he entered upon one of the greatest and most complicated labours to be achieved by the historian, and at a moment when the nearness of the events to he described necessarily makes their true proportion difficult to discern.     Sir Julian Corbett&apos;s presentment is admirably clear and of extraordinary interest.&quot; - Morning Post.&quot;The Government was well Inspired when it authorised the Historial Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence to direct the publication of a work descriptive of the Naval Operations of the War, and to entrust it to Sir Julian Corbett ......    With conscientious care and goodjudgment he has arranged his material, and, where he describes the organisation of the patrols and such matters, and describes the battles of Coronel and the Falklands, probably no future historian will go beyond him. ......     the author has been careful to make known tho extraordinary complexity of the problems the Admiralty had to solve, and the vast movements it had to control.     With all its inevitable limitations, which must be a greater source of regret to the author than to his readers, the volume is of the highest value.   It is essential to all those who wish to know what the Navy did in those critical times.&quot; - jPaily ^a&amp;hic.&quot;This volume is a valuable lead in the history of the war because it surveys so briefly such a vast arena and so many elements in the war, yet the author seems not to have missed a single point of importance,     He dovetails the different sections with such finesse that it reads smoothly, and presents a complete picture of the period of the first four months of the war.     * v , 9 e .     Sir Julian Corbettfs book is a plain, simple, unvarnished tale of a great period in our history, and should be widely read to understand what this nation passed through in the early period of the war. As a survey of that period it is masterly,&quot;      Lloyd&apos;s List.&quot;It is an astoundingly dextrous account of situations as tangled and of operations as complex as can well be con-ceived.     Sir Julian handles the hundred intricacies of his task with the&apos; easy mastery of the prestidigitator.   He may have thought that we knew something,of the problems that faced the.Admiralty in August, 1914.     This volume multiplies our knowledge by ten.   Yet it leaves us less confused, more sure of the main outline, than we were before.    The mere enumeration of the operations described makes it almost incredible that the story can be told in so&apos; short a compass as 436 pages.     It is a panorama of infinite detail, and its incidents cover happenings in every sea.     It makes one&apos;gasp to thinkrof the. study and work involved.   One can but be grateful for the miracle of this achievement.    There is no doubt about it that this Is a very, very skilful book.     And - it will achieve &quot;its purpose perfectly.     But we must remember, and always remember, that Its purpose is to present in a/popular
popular, readable form a non-controversial, official story of the naval war.    How deftly the author can deal with delicate matters is shown by the handling of the two blunders, thanks to which the Goeben got into the Dardanelles and the intrepid Cradook was sent to the tragedy of Ooronel.&quot; -Sunday Times.&quot;The operations are carefully described, and all who read may understand.    There is material, indeed, in this hook to enable every reader to form opinion, and, in some oases, even judgments of his own.     The evidences are ample. The book, indeed, is in many ways wonderful.    The author haB accomplished a great task exceedingly well, and the admirable volume of maps adds immensely to the value of a very remark-able work.&quot;       The Observer.&quot;The book is uniquely interesting and valuable.    Those who hope to find any sensational revelations will be dis-appointed   .......    The exigencies of space inhibit morethan a word of appreciation for the author&apos;s masterly analy-sis of the general situation      political and strategical as it existed on the eve of the war.&quot;   -   Pall Mall Gazette.&quot;The first volume of Sir Julian Corbett&apos;s history of the war at sea, prepared from the Admiralty records for the Committee of -Imperial Defence, is profoundly interesting. The author&apos;s lucid End dispassionate works on the past history of our JSavy had shown that he was specially qualified to record its greatest undertaking, and his new book is all that we had expected it to be as a narrative, even if some of his occasional remarks and deductions may provoke dissent -......   We must commend the Government or the publishersfor issuing the book at a low price, for such a book deserves countless readers.     It shows more clearly than ever before the supreme value of the British flavy to the Empire and to the Allies in 1914.     In all the Seven Seas the Kavy was busily engaged during the critical weeks following the declaration of war, and our military operations as well as our overseas trade depended entirely upon its ability to play its part, the naval actions of which, the public heard at intervals were , mere incidents in a vast and world-wide scheme of operations which Sir Julian Corbett is the first to describe in accurate detail.    Readers of the &quot;Campaign of Trafalgar&quot; know that Sir Julian Corbett is at.his best in expounding naval strategy. The great merit of his new book consists in the explanation of the general strategical position of the war on land and -sea.   The author enables us to see, almost- from &amp;ay to day, how a complex,of problems was viewed by the Admiralty, and how many conflicting demands had to be met out of resources which, though large, were inadequate for a %orld war . .     . . . .   We shall look with great interest for the continuation of the story.&quot;    The Spectator.&quot;We are ^leased by being able to report confidently that it ie well with  unaffected thanks.    The mere material form of the volume is excellent.    Good paper, good type plenty of maps, or, rather, charts, and a copious index combine to make a capital example of the thing called, a book.&quot;*he. Field...&quot;The merit of Sir Julian corbetts work will be better appreciated as time goes on. .... He has brought together anabundance/
&quot;The style is so admirable In its clearness, and the events so sha^p with interest, that most readers will read the book fromjcover to cover./ - The Lancett&quot;It is not a disparagement, but a description of the book, to say that it is the best example yet&apos; of Government propaganda.   This does not diminish; it adds to its interestJ and simply because it gives us a vast deal of information, &apos;not only rightly denied during the war., but successfully concealed until the publication of this volume It is not the author&apos;s business to raise controversies, hut to quiet them, and read in the light of his mission the book is admirablei&quot; - -  ffite Universe,&quot;The first volume of his work, which takes us- up tfe/ and includes, the Falklands battle, justifies the highest&quot;/ expectations.   It is frank,and candid to the British people, more than generous to the foe, and so lucid in its treatment of difficult and complicated problems that it may lead to a disastrous increase In the number of people who feeltheftn selves competent to express authorative opinions upon questions of naval strategy.   .   .   .   .   .   .   But the deepestand mofet lasting Impression his words create is of the immensity and complexity of the problems which beset the British Admiralty in its task of making the seven seas safe for all the Allies.   .   *   .   .   .   .&apos;   The volume/ of maps whichaccompany the letterpress will be found of the greatest assistance.   We look forward with eager anticipation to the appearance of the volumes dealing with the later dove-lopments Of the naval part of the war.&quot;   - -   The Tablet.&quot;His story has little of the official notej   It is lucid, full, judiciousj and In the best sense popular.   It clears many matters which have been obscure, it justifies the , Admiralty against many ignorant criticisms.   Above all, It Increases our pride in the achievement of the Navy in fact , of perils far beyond any which their predecessors knew.&quot; - -Church Times.&quot;We have only taintly indicated the absorbing interest and the value of sir Julianas narrative, and his continuation of the record will be eagerly expected.   The fine series of&apos; maps are an illuminating and most serviceable adjunct to theJpoo\t$&quot; - - Christian World.&apos;&apos;abundanoe of information and In the arrangement and pre-sentation of it has shown great skill.   The general public will appreciate the lucidity of the narrative end its scholarly style.   In. a record produced under such circum-stances it was not to be expected that any definite line would he taken with respect to certain vexed and controver-sial questions which have arisen out of the events dealt with. The aim of the author has evidently been to provide the materials from which his readers can draw their own conclu* sions*&quot; -* Army &amp; Navy Gazette,
&quot;A wise choice was made in selecting Sir Julian So Corbett to write, that section of the Official History of the War dealing with naval operations,   A naval expert might.have represented a schoolj     Sir Julian is a recognized student of naval affairs.11 - - The Yorkshire Poso0&quot;He omits nothing and distorts nothing .....    .Sir Julian&apos;s acoount of the escape of the Goeben is full, precise and careful, and one gathers from it that really no-body was to blame, and that it could not be helped.   Then the real Sir Julian peeps out timidly for a moment, observes that after all it was a very bad business, and hurriedly Subsides.   &apos;;.   *    ,    .    .   By the aid of abundant maps, some in the volume and others in&quot;.a separate case, one is able to follow out the&apos; very involved world-wide movements that Sir Julian details with a closeness not hitherto approached by any writer.   One cannot go far into the book without having light thrown on something formerly obscure.&quot; - -/ Sheffield Daily Telegraph.&quot;The official history of the war has not been long in making - - or beginning to make - - its appearance-   To-day is issued through the firm of Longmans Vol,I of the history of the naval operations.  -It:is: from the hand of Sir Julian S. Corbett, our principal authority upon the Trafalgar campaigns and the part borne by tho Navy in the Seven. Years&apos; War, whose work at the Naval Staff College has done so much for the present generation of naval officers; and at the outset it ought to be said that he and the publishers havo combined to produce a volume for the general public as distinguished from one appealing merely to historians and naval experts.   At 17s 6d net, the price of the volume and the accompanying case,, of maps must be pronounced remarkably lowj while the author&apos;s&apos;/stylet *^Official History of tho War1 is a phrase which sets the spine appropriately shivering, with its reminiscences of professional exercises in suppressing the truth and suggesting the false, all very excusable as a measure of war, but far removed from the cold, dispassionate judgments at whi^h history aims but rarely realises.   The anticipated shiver is unnecessary.   This book may describe itself as official history, but it is not; not a bit of it.   How could it be?   An official history would mean the deliberate pro-nounceraont of the Admiralty-through one or other of its organs, presumably its staff, on the conduct of the naval war, but as often as not it is the policy of the Admiralty itself which has to be appraised.   And that perhaps is the most im-portant, as it is certainly for the public the freshest, part, of the historian1s task.    ....   .   *    c   This history is only^&quot;half official, hot to be confused with semi-official, which too often means propaganda in its most invidious form.   The Admiralty has supplied the official;material, and Sir Julian Corbett has exercised Upon it an independent judgment.   It is a happy combination, not only because Sir Julian Corbett   -is unfettered in his appreciations, but because his habit of mind enables him to&apos; avoid the welter of dry and technical detail which is the besetting offence of many professional military historians.   If this is an official history it is not very far from being a popular history also, in the best sense of the word. .    .   It must not be supposed- &apos;that the reader will find in this book ground for large or frequent criticism of the Admiralty.   He will find many occasions for praise and admiration.&quot; - -.Manchester Guardiant
stylt, though sobtr and studiously fret from piotur&amp;squeness, is equally free from difficult technicalities and from controversial matter.&quot;   Birmingham Post.&quot;As one might have anticipated, the book far and away surpasses in interest all unofficial narratives.   It is a chapter ef England*s history which no Englishman or women ought to leave unread.   Not to have done so will be to have out oneself *ff from one of the most thrilling narratives of peril and adventure taat have ever, in the world1s history,fallen to the lot of the historian to tell. . .....There is the romance of the sea in every chapter, such romance as no previous sea writer has probably had at his disposal. To the Englishman who is proud of his navy, and of the men who spend their lives upon the waters, volumes such as these should be among the most treasured possessions of his literary shelves.&quot;       Eastern Evening Mercury.&quot;Of the disaster tff Coronel, when Admiral Cradook, overwhelmed by the superior squadron of Von Spee, perished in the Good Hope, and the Monmouth, maimed.and helpless, was driven to the bottom, Sir Julian1s account makes one tingle with pride for the spirit of the navy,&quot;     Nottingham Guardian.&quot;It is therefore a work of the very first importance, to which we must look for the correction on official authority of many of the erroneous ideas that have gathered round some if not most, of the operations of the war.     In the choioe of. their naval historian the Government have been distinctlyfortunate..... . . .   In Sir Julian Corbett we have notonly a judicious and accurate historian, but a writer who by virtue of a nervous and jtrresting style can, while in nowise relaxing from the dignity which befits a work of this type, infuse some life even into the dry bones of statistical detail.&quot;     Western Morning News.&quot;The first volume deals largely with the immediate pre-war period, and is chiefly notable for Sir Julian corbetts masterly analysis of the pre-war situation, political and strategical.&quot;      Western Daily Mercury.-  &quot;It is the work of Sir Julian Corbett, for many years a distinguished member of the small band of civilian investi-gators and authorities who have earned for Brita;;^ such reputation as she possesses in the study and chronicling of war upon land or sea.&quot;   South 7/ales Daily post.&quot;For all practical purposes it is an authentic and definitive .*&amp;count.The Admiralty may be congratulated on the expedition zijsy have shown in having such an account prepared.     .....   They may be congratulated, too, ontheir choice of a historian.   There is no one better fitted than the. author of &quot;The Campaign of Trafalgar&quot; to deal with such a subject.   He possesses in an eminent degree the sea sense rainforoed with vd.de and minute knowledge of naval history, and his eloquent and dignified pen is able to give an intelligible and proportioned view free from technicalities and thoroughly readable.    The magnitude of the taslc might well have affrighted a Macaulay, but Sir Julian Corbett shows himself master of it in its minutest details as in its wider bearings.&quot;   The Scotsman.,
&quot;It le to the general reader, wo imagine, that those volumes are intended to appeal, and it is certainly the general roader who ought &quot;to buy them, react them and ponder them if he wishes to understand how events were shaped, to make the Europe that is and the Europe that will be. . . .. . .   His history is indeed a jopdel of what such a hiatory- -should he.   There is no heat and/eloquence, only a sober record of fact, omitting nothing, glossing over nothing, striotly impartial and even generous * rising once or twice to some thing approaching emotion *is ho dwells on a sacrifice like Cradook&apos;s at Coronel or whole-hearted admiration as he chronloles von Speefs resolve to fight off the Falklands.&quot;Glasgow Horaid.&quot;The text of Volume I, takes us to the battle of the Falklandsj December 1914, and intensely interesting it all is with its mass of maps, plans, charts and diagrams illustrating the text.    As the whole vork is compiled from Admiralty official documents its accuracy may be guaranteed. There is. of course, nothing critical or controversial, just a very lucid narrative of facts as they happened.&quot; -Edinburgh Evening News.&quot;The 1Offioial History of the War1 has made a promising start with this volume, and Sir Julian Corbett is to be complimented on the way in which he has carried out a difficult task.   The numerous excellent maps and^good index are of the greatest use in understanding the operations, and in these days the modest prioe and the excellent &quot;get-up&quot; of tho book ^should help to commend it to many readers.&quot; -Aberdeen B^ee Press.
