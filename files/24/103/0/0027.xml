With reference to the General Stiiff memorandum on the Turkish Peace Treaty, dated the 1st April and circulated to the Cabinet by the Under Secretary of State lor War on that date, the General Staff submit the following comments on the report which has now been received from Marshal Foch on the military measures necessary to put into execution the Treaty of Peace with Turkey in certain eventualities.2. Turning first to the two notes by the Greek Military Representative enclosed at the head of Marshal Poch&apos;s report, the General Staff are struck by the discrepancy between the first note, dated the 19th March, and the second, dated the 22nd March, which was presumably handed in to the Marshall Commission after the first disclosure of the Greek case had been checked by the Greek Government.(a.) The first note places eight Greek divisions at the disposal of the Allies, six in the Smyrna area and two in Thrace. It undertakes a limited Greek liability in Thrace, though it arranges for Greek troops to overrun the whole area of Greek ambitions there and in Anatolia. Weak Allied detachments are to assist the one Greek division which in Western Thrace is bo consolidate the Greek position vis-a-vis Bulgaria, while the second available Greek division in this theatre is to relieve the Allied (French V) troops in Eastern Thrace.At the same time Allied interests are to be served and Turkish opposition terminated by the penetration of Greek troops into &quot; the richest provinces of the future Turkish State &quot; (vide last paragraph of Greek note of the 19th March).No reference to the protection of minorities in the interior of Turkey is traceable.(6.) In the second note Bulgaria drops out of the picture, and a third, partially mobilized Greek division, is discovered for use in Thrace, while it is represented that one or more of four divisions which are stated to remain on a peace footing in the interior of Greece can be mobilized at the disposal of the Allies, if required. The period necessary for mobilization is not indicated nor is it said whether the necessary equipment and transport are forthcoming. However, the Military Representative is now prompted by his Government to undertake the responsibility for the complete occupation of Thrace with three Greek divisions (including one partially mobilized) and two cavalry regiments unaided by Allied troops, as against the four infantry divisions considered necessary by Marshal Foch.That the nature of this occupation is intended to be severe is signified by the suggestion that one of the Greek divisions might be detached to Trebizond after the first measures have been put into force in Thrace.Mention is now made of the Armenians, where their interests coincide with the local interests of the Greeks. But it is not stated how far, and with what transport, the Greek division from Thrace is prepared to penetrate into the Armenian hinterland of the Greek Pontus, nor how the lives of the Armenians in Cilicia and the eastern vilayets are to be safe-guarded during the operations.Nor, in recommending a simultaneous advance into Anatolia, which it is claimed would attract the Turks towards the Greek forces based on Smyrna, is the probability mentioned that the actual effect of this advance might well be to head the Turks in no uncertain temper towards the Armenian vilayets. The elastic guerilla nature of the Turkish opposition which would be encountered and which has been emphasized by Marshal Foch, does not appear to be fully appreciated.It is also remarked that the note of alarm for his own situation, recently sounded by the Greek Commander at Smyrna in his representations to General Milne, is now dropped.(B20/166)   100  4/20  H&amp;S   8111 wo
(c.) In short, these Greek notes confirm the anticipation of the General Staff, expressed in paragraph 5 of their memorandum of the 1st April, that the present juncture would be seized by the Greek Government to offer their troops for the coercion of Turkey from the incentive of territorial gain, rather than of the enforcement of a just, even if a severe, peace, which it is assumed the Allied Government desire.8. Turning now to Marshal Foch&apos;s recommendations, the General Staff should point out that, in accordance with-information which cannot have been available at Versailles when the report was drafted, the mobilization of Jaffar Tayar Bey in Thrace, alluded to in a footnote on page 2 of the report has not been successful and has been repudiated by the Constantinople Government, as far as opposition to an Allied occupation is intended. None the less, the General Staff endorse the Marshall&quot; estimate of the number of troops required for the occupation of Thrace. It must be remembered that the defeat of the Turkish forces is not the sole factor in the situation, for the occupation and administration, without undue bloodshed, of the scene of bitterly conflicting national interests is involved. Nor must the strong distinction drawn by the Turkish Government between an Allied as opposed to a Greek occupation of Thrace be overlooked.If it is decided to permit an occupation of Thrace, by a force containing a majority of Greek troops, the General Staff are in complete agreement with Marshal Foch regarding the necessity of placing the Greek troops, in Thrace under an Allied commander. And they consider that they should further be supervised by Allied officers if incidents, such as accompanied the original Greek landing at Smyrna, are to be avoided.4. To assist consideration of the estimate of the forces submitted by the Versailles Commission as necessary, under the terms of reference, together with the number of troops actually available and the dispositions recommended, the attached Table A has been prepared.This summarises Marshal foch: report. It should be noted that the Marshal does not appear to have been satisfied that the Greeks can actually place more than nine divisions in the field (three in Thrace and six in Anatolia), and on this understanding the four Greek divisions stated to be on a peace footing are ignored in the table.Nor is account taken in the table of the four divisions which the Italian General Staff think may be necessary over and above Marshal foch: recommendations.5. The General Staff concur in the note at the bottom of page 1 of the report, that consideration of operations in Kurdistan, Syria proper, or Palestine, is not covered by the terms of reference. But they would observe that the probability has to be envisaged of outbreaks in these countries, aimed at the establishment of Arab independence, under cover of Allied distraction in Turkey. This would have the inevitable effect of increasing the strain on the military resources of France and Great Britain at a time when there are no reserves available and the European, and Home situations are unsettled.6. The General Staff take the above into account, and are in complete agreement with paragraph 3 of Marshal foch: report regarding the necessity for simultaneous operations, which must&apos; not unduly prolong the Allied intervention.Nor can they overlook the necessity that when once operations have been inaugurated they must be brought to a complete conclusion. There can be no half measures. They therefore are in complete accord with the Marshals recommendations regarding the number of divisions necessary to enforce the Turkish Peace Treaty as at present outlined, as well as with the remarks regarding the employment of Greek troops in Turkey, and with the conclusion of the Versailles report.Finally, they would draw attention to the enormous amount of land and sea transport which would be involved in the operations, and it is not known whence this would be forthcoming..7. If, however, it is still decided to raise troops and pursue a plan of campaign on the lines of Marshal Foch&apos;s recommendations, the General Staff are in agreement regarding the necessity for setting up an Allied Headquarters under a Supreme Commander. The command of the subordinate groups would be a matter for adjust-ment when once the plan of campaign has been approved.General Staff,War Office,7th April, 1920.
