IIEUOEAHHJU OIT THE i^OOifl^iMTIOlIS OB&apos; the ADVISORY COIESTESE OH&apos; LOIIDOH T:,:u\FFIC,The Advisory Committee on London Tr&amp;ffio presided over by Mr, Kennedy Jones have now presented their report.    They recommend as a measure of extreme urgency the creation of a London Traffic Authority. Such a Body was suggested by the Royal Commission of 1905 and by the two Select Committees which have since dealt with London Traffic questions and the Advisory Committee consider that it is necessary for the comfortf convenience, health and financial Interest of the public, It has therefore been recommended four times in 15 years.The Advisory Committee point put that under tho existing United powers of control, with their present form and distribution, it is Impossible for them to put forward proposals for the introduction of extensive traffic reform, these powers &quot;being quite inadequate either effectively to alleviate existing conditions or to offer any hope of permanent improvement.Moreover the traffio facilities of London are no longer equal to the demands put upon thorn.    Hew tube&apos; railways are required, new tramways extensions which will make for greater carrying capacity:   a more scientific development of omnibus traffic, and a just and true perception of the proper function of each &quot;form of transit in order that wasteful competition may be avoided and each used to its highest efficiency^The need for the creation of a Traffic Authority is rendered the more urgent by the serious financial
condition of the London Traffic Undertakings at the present tine.Composition &amp; Statutory Position of the Authority.The Advisory Committee recoiiimend that the Traffic Authority should be appointed by Parliament as a permanent statutory Body under the Ilinister jxf Transport to deal with all matters connected nith London Traffic in the Metropolitan and City Police Areas, and. that it should bo composed of three members, including the Chairman.     The Advisory Committee point out that the situation has been changed since previous Bodies reported, by the appointment of the Minister of Transport with wide powers of traffic control, and they consider that the Traffic Authority should be responsible to the Minister of Transport who would in turn be responsible to Parliament.     The Minister Would delegate to it the powers essential to the proper control and regulation of London Trafficj   and the Authority would ,   also exeroise such other powers as may by Order in Council be transferred to the minister of Transport and delegated by him to the Authority.In order that the powers of the Authority may be adequate the Advisory Committee express the hope that Parliament trill consent to grant to the Minister of Transport certain essential-additional powers.   (3oe Appendix 2 of the Meport)The expenses of the Traffic Authority would be included in the official estimates of the Ministry of Transport and its work would thus come before Parliament in the ordinary way.
m   3 , -Relations with Local Authorities.The Advisory Committee state that in their recommendations the existing powers of Local Authorities are respected, subject to guidance and the minimum degree of interference from the Traffic Authority, where, considerations compel the treatment of the traffic problem from the point of view of the community as a &quot;tfhole.    The main point affecting the poviiers of Local Authorities is the abolition of their power of Veto of tram routes under Standing Order No,22.&apos;&quot;I must however point out to the Cabinet that in m$r opinion the Local Authorities will raise very strong objection to the proposals.    These in effect involve the creation of an overriding authority which will be in a&apos; position to stop their private Bills if they do not conform to the policy of the Authority, and which will take from them their much valued power of Veto which they regard as an essential municipal prerogative.The financial position of the Local Authoritiesiwill not however be prejudiced as the Bill setting up the Traffic Authority will have to contain provision for making grants or loans or recouping losses on any services ordered by the Traffic Authority under the Minister of Transport.Relations with Transport Undertakings.The Advisory Committee propose that the Traffic Authority should deal with the co-ordination in the public interest of all London passenger transport
undertakings, and for this purpose the Authority will require power to stipulate the density of service and the hours of wording for all forms of passenger transport, to define omnibus routes, and require the execution of works necessary to obtain through rtinning of tramcar-2:   it is also proposed that the Traffic Authority should have power&apos;to require extensions of Tramway, Oronibus. local railway and tube services where necessary, as well as such co-operative working as conditions allow....&quot;   It will be necessary to make provision for an undertaking- to recover the loss If g,uy incurred by reason of an order given by the Minister under these powers, i..e. to amplify clause IV of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919,Interim Hep oriraenda t ion *Until the Traffic Authority is established by Act of Parliament the Advisory Committee are of opinion that the existence of an Advisory Committee to the Minister of Transport, assisted by a Technical Committee representing every interest, should be continued.(Signed)   EFJO GEDDBS.,9th April, 1920.
