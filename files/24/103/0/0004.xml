CABDW.l^emorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.r present herewith the Report of the British Empire statistical Conference held at the Board of Trade from 20th January to 26th February last.The resolution of the Imperial Y/ar Conference (10th July, 1913) which expressed approval of &quot;the proposal to hold a Conference of Statisticians after the war&quot; added &quot;that such Conference consider the establishment of an Imperial Statistical Bureau under the supervision of an Inter-Imperial Committee1&apos;. The recent Conference accordingly examined this question with much care anil the most important part of the recommendations of its Report to which I desire to direct the attention of the Cabinet relates to the scheme drawn up for the establishment of an Empire Bureau,   The carrying out of the project would involve the provision of the funds necessary for the maintenance of the Bureau by joint contributions of those carts of the Empire which may decide to support the proposal. If all the Dominions and India and the principal Colonies, as well as the United Kingdom  should contribute &apos; .&amp;. &apos;sum of about  16 000., rising quickly to about  27,000, yearly wuild, it is estimated, represent approximately the contribution of. this country.   The Report has, accordingly, been forwarded to the Treasury and the attention   ) of that-Department has been directed to these proposals.In view of the support given to the proposal for setting up an Empire Statistical Bureau in the Conference itself and in the course of public comment on the proceedings of the Conference, I desire to recommend that the Government of the United Kingdom should declare in principle its adhesion of the proposal subject to the condition&quot; that &quot;the Governments of India, and the self-governing Dominions should decide to support it. These Governments should be consulted without loss of time and, should they notify their approval of the proposal,I propose that an Inter-Imperial Committee&quot;should be set up to proceed: with the necessary formal preliminary work leading up to the organisation of the Bureau, ana to examine more closely the cuestions of star.: and expenses.The recent Conference presented a large number of recommenda-tions dealing with special groups of statistics, both in their general and in their technical aspects.   I understand that my colleagues who are concerned with&quot; the work of the Census and Allied statistical work desire to present to the Cabinet their views on the proposals of-the Conference which concern that work. I desire to suggest that the Report of the Conference be . commended to the favourable consideration of all the Government Departments to whose work the resolutions of the Conference relate, and that it be formally transmitted to the various Dominion and other Governments within the Empire, both those directly represented at the Conference and those of the Colonies and Protectorates not indiViduallv so represented.R..S.

BRITISH EMPIRE STATISTICAL CONFERENCE. January 20th to February 26tflJ 1920.Part I.-Report of the Proceedings of the Conference.The first conference of Government officers dealing with statistics in the British Empire assembled in London on January 20th, .1920. Twenty-four meetings of the Conference were held, and, in order to deal with detailed work in con-uection with the principal subjects arising for discussion, committees Avere appointed to examine such details. These committees were, in addition to a General Purposes Committee, die following: -(1) A Committee to prepare a scheme for a British EmpireStatistical Bureau; (2) A Trade Statistics Committee ;(3) A Committee on Statistics of Agricultural Production ; (4) A Census Statistics Committee ;(5) A Registration (Births, Marriages and Deaths). Com-mittee;(6) A Committee on Colonial and Protectorate Blue Books ; (7) A Committee on Prices and Index Numbers; (8) A Labour Statistics Committee ; (9) A Financial Statistics Committee.The Committees have held numerous meetings, appointing in some cases sub-committees to deal with special points, and most of the resolutions annexed to this report have resulted from their recommendations after consideration by the Conference.The Conference has had the advantage of the assistance of Sir Henry Rew, K.C.B., throughout its consideration of agricultural statistics. Mr. L. J. Kershaw, C.S.I., C.I.E., of the India Office, one of the official representatives at the recent Labour Conference at Washington, was good enough to afford valuable information in regard to the International Labour Organisation provided for by the recent Treaties of Peace, and Professor Bowley attended to discuss questions relating to trade statistics on which he had given evidence before the Dominions Royal Commission. At the discussions relating to statistics of migration vt Conference had the assistance of Mr. Haldane Porter, Hi- Majesty&apos;s Chief Inspector in the Aliens Branch of the Home Office, and of representatives of the Oversea Settle-ment Committee. In addition to the formal meetings of the Conference at the Offices of the Board of Trade&apos;, a meeting with Sir Eric Druinmoncl, Secretary General of the League of Nations, was held at Sunderland House on February 17th, in order to discuss the relations of the contemplated Empire organisation of statistics to the plans Avhich the League of Nations Secretariat are preparing for an International statistical organisation.a (33)10170  Pk 2767  2000   4/20  E &amp; S A 2
The Conference desires to express its great regret that, as a consequence of severe illness, Mr. E, II. Godfrey, one of the Canadian delegates, was from an early date unable to assist at its deliberations. The delegates have learned with pleasure that lit has made great progress towards complete recovery.British Empire Statistical Bureau.Among the resolutions adopted by the Conference the first place must bo given to those which deal with the question of a British Empire Statistical Bureau. The Conference has pro-nounced unequivocally in favour of the early establishment of such a bureau, and of its thorough equipment with the means of undertaking the important work which, in the opinion of the Conference, cannot be carried out by any other means.In making this recommendation the Conference has been mainly influenced by the Following considerations : Before the war, it had already become evident that there was a great need for some central organisation to obtain,  co-ordinate, and  unify statistical  information relating to all parts of the Empire.   The experience of the last five years has fully demonstrated the disadvantages resulting from the lack of systematic statistical investiga-tions and of complete and comparable records relating to Imperial resources and development, while the heightened sense of unity and common interest between the various parts of the Empire, which the war has inspired, has strengthened the desire for the creation of a central Statistical Bureau.   For many years the Board of Trade have prepared and published summaries of the principal statistics relating to the various countries of the Empire, hut the Conference was of opinion that these publications were inadequate for a proper and complete survey of Empire conditions.   The proposed bureau would not merely summarise the records, but would apply the analytical methods which have been developed by the advance of statistical science to the examination of the material and the presentation of the results.The defects in Imperial statistics, and the need for improved organisation, were fully recognised by the Dominions Royal Cominisi lor., and in paragraphs 672-679 of their Final Report (Od, -S &apos;(of 1917) they dealt with the matter at some length, their c( conclusion being that the creation of a central bureau is eminently desirable.It is with this sjjecific object in view, and in accordance with the recommendation by the Dominions Royal Corn-mission and the resolution adopted by the Imperial War Conference of 1918, that the present Conference was called together.
The Conference has, during the course of its sittings, surveyed generally the entire range of public statistics available in the Empire and has $found that a very large body of valuable information already exists, &apos;but that, owing to the lack of co-ordination, much of it is not readily available for the objects sought to be realised.The primary object of establishing the central bureau is to enable effect to be given to the decisions and recoin-mendations of the Conference, and to ensure the realisation of its proposals relating to the co-ordination of the statistics of the British Empire. It is clear that, unless such an institution is set up, the work of the Conference will be to a large extent ineffective.This result would be clue, not to lack of loyalty to the .&apos; Conference on the part of its members, but to the absence of a suitable organisation through which the necessary cohesion might be secured. A central bureau would further serve as a connecting link between the first conference and any subsequent conference which it might be decided to convene, and would ensure continuity in the statistical work resulting therefrom.The proposals put forward by the Conference for the con-stitution and functions of the bureau are aimed at establishing it on a basis which would ensure its efficiency, and would enable it to command the respect and confidence not only of the Statistical Departments, but also of the Administrative Depart-ments, in all countries of the Empire. Further, the Conference was strongly of opinion that the bureau should not be, and should not appear to be, dependent upon the Government of any one country.The Dominions Royal Commission suggested that an Empire Statistical Bureau might conveniently be placed under the authority of the Imperial Development Board, which the Corn-mission desired to see established. That Imperial authority has, however, not as yet been created, nor does there yet exist an Imperial Secretariat responsibility to which might have secured the primary objects aimed at by the Conference. The Conference has, accordingly, proposed that the Bureau should be controlled by a special Council, established by Royal Charter, and has suggested that, in order to emphasise the Imperial character of this Council, the President should be the Prime Minister of the United, Kingdom, in his capacity as President of the periodical Imperial Conferences. With a similar object in view, the Conference would have desired that the Director of the proposed bureau should be appointed directly by the Crown; a mode of appointment which would be peculiarly appreciated in India and in some of the self-governing Dominions. It was represented to the Conference, however, that this would, in effect, mean that the appointment would be made on the advice
of a Minister of the United Kingdom and would not, therefore, have the essentially Imperial character which formed the object, of the proposal.rJme Conference,therefore, while desiring to emphasise the objects in view, does not desire to press for the exact procedure outlined in the resolutions, if it should be found that these objects can better be attained by other methods.The money necessary for the maintenance of the bureau should, in the opinion of the Conference, be provided by joint, contributions from the various countries concerned in its. establishment.Statistics of Foreign Trade.In dealing with trade statistics the Conference, while appreciating the desirability of. securing the utmost possible degree of comparability, and even of uniformity,  in the statistics prepared, has recognised that differenpes of conditions exist which form a real obstacle to complete uniformity, and, therefore, it is not in all cases to be desired that this obstacle should be surmounted.   While recommending the compilation of trade statistics for the calendar year in all countries of the Empire, the Conference recognised that there may he special reasons in some cases for maintaining a different year for general purposes.   Similarly, in reference to the mode of valuation of imports and exports it has been recognised that Customs legislation must override statistical considerations., but the Conference has recommended that a uniform method should, if possible, be adopted in order to produce comparable statistics, even though it may he necessary to maintain another method of valuation for Customs purposes.   In the registration of imports and exports by countries, again, it was recognised that, in some countries, the manner in which local trade is-conducted makes it difficult to secure the precise informa-tion which is desirable, and the Conference has recommended that, in such cases, an attempt shorn1 d be made to add to the existing record a further record on a basis suitable for Empire comparisons.   If additional statistics can thus be secured, it. may be found that, in a few years, the obstacles to uniformity of methods are being gradually overcome.   A special recom-mendation has been made that all trade returns should be accompanied by explanatory notes dealing particularly Avith those points in which, as divergences of practice may reason-ably arise, it is desirable that the precise methods adopted in the returns should be clearly defined.   This principle  of prefatory memoranda to statistical returns has also been endorsed by the Conference for general application, that is, in connection with subjects other than trade statistics.
Agricultural Statistics.^The Conference has examined at considerable length the deficiencies in existing statistics of agricultural and pastoral production, and has made a series of recommendations aimed at improving this important branch of public information. Resolutions indicating the mode of determining the values to be shown in any general survey of agricultural production have also been presented to and adopted by the Conference, which, has, further, expressed the opinion that a quinquennial census of agricultural and pastoral production should be taken to supplement annual returns where these are not already complete. So far as possible, the year 1920-21 should, in the opinion of the&apos; Conference, be adopted for one of the series, and, even if it be necessary in. some cases to defer the inquiry so as to cover the year 1921-22, it is recommended that the succeeding census in the series should relate to 1925-26.Census of Manufactures.With reference to manufacturing production as well as to agricultural production, the Conference has expressed a view in favour of a quinquennial survey in those cases in which annual statistics are not obtainable.Census of Population.The enumeration of the population is another subject regarding which the Conference has expressed a view in favour of a census every five years at least, and, though a uniform census day has not been suggested, it has been recommended that the census should in all parts of the Empire fall within two months of April 15th. In view of the fact that in some cases the census enumeration is made on a de jure basis, the Conference has recommended that the information to he obtained should include sufficient particulars to permit the preparation of figures showing the aggregate de facto population of each sex.The Conference has examined and adopted recommendations with respect to the classification of the population by industries and by occupations, with a view to securing that these classifications, which are needed for purposes other than that of the population census, should be arranged on the same lines in all cases in which the numbers are required for Empire comparisons, and further, that even wiriiin any one country, classifications by industries for the purpose of the population census, for the purpose of the census of production, in connection with unemployment statistics, and for other purposes should he on a uniform basis. The Conference has also expressed the view that, in the&apos;interest
of continuity of statistical policy, the legislation uncle]-.which, in each part of the Empire, the census of population is taken should be permanent, in character.Registration of Births and Deaths.Resolutions have, in addition, been adopted in favour of securing more complete information in connection with the registration of births and deaths so as to enable the social structure of the population to be more completely examined. The detailed resolutions passed by the Conference show the nature of the recommendations.Emigration and Immigration.The Conference, impressed by the desiiability of securing adequate statistics of the movement of persons from country to country, has specified a minimum range of information regarding migrants by the use of which population estimates for intercensal years may be made more reliable.Statistics of Prices.The measurement of changes in the general level of prices in the wholesale markets, and of the purchasing power of money in retail trade, has attained an importance which the Conference has recognised in a series of, resolutions expressing the need for the maintenance of records of prices and for the regular preparation of index-numbers of price movements. In this, as in other fields, it has drawn attention to the undesirability of attempting a formal identity of practice in computing such index-numbers, believing that the most accurate measurement of the movements in each country -affords the soundest basis for tracing the relative changes in different countries. At the same time, a general principle has been enuuciated, and it is hoped that the calculations made in the various countries will be maintained in accordance therewith.In view of the changing character of the requirements of modern communities, the Conference has advised that a periodic revision should be undertaken of the standards in accordance with which the several index-numbers are computed, due regard being given, in a manner prescribed in the resolutions, to securing continuity in the records. Further, believing that misunderstanding can best he avoided by frank and precise explanation of the procedure by which the index-numbers are obtained, the Conference recommends that full details of the methods and of the data employed should be made public in a readily accessible form.
Financial Statistics.The field of Financial Statistics was recognised to be so vast that no attempt at its complete survey could be made in the time at the disposal of the Conference. It has, accordingly, been found practicable to make recommendations only with reference to certain subjects of immediate importance. These recommendations, too, relate not to conclusions reached by the Conference itself from the examination of data already available, hut to the desirability of investigations being under-taken by the proposed Empire Bureau. The subjects specially selected for such inquiries include budget and debt statistics of national, provincial, municipal and other local governments within the Empire, the national wealth and the distribution of property and income, currency: movements, the movements of capital from country to country, and the fluctuations in value of stock exchange securities. The Conference has, further, recommended that monthly bank returns, generally similar in form to those proposed in the recent, Report of the cunliffe Committee, should be obtained and published in each country.It was also decided to recommend that the preparation of statistics relating to other financial corporations, and to each class of insurance, should be undertaken by the proposed Bureau.Statistics relating to Labour.Statistics relating to Labour problems, apart from their importance to every advanced community, will he required in connection with the activities of the International Labour Organisation established under the Peace Treaty. The Con-ference recommends that the countries of the British Empire should not await the demands of the International Labour Conferences, but should, without delay, systematise and extend the statistics already prepared and utilise them for the purposes of the British Empire.Power to obtain Statistical Information.Where the necessary &quot;authority to obtain statistics of public importance has not already been provided, the Conference recommends that the matter should receive attention with a view to remedying the defect.Statistics of Colonies and Protectorates.The opportunity provided by the Conference has been utilised to examine the form and content of the &quot;Blue Books&quot; prepared in the various Colonies and Protectorates of the British Empire, and a report on the subject has been presented: to the Conference by a committee which devoted much time and
Mechanical Tabulation.The delegates have, on several occasions during the meetings of the Conference, inspected different types of tabulating and calculating machinery in use in Government offices and else-where. The Conference recognised that advancing require-ments for statistical information render the use of mechanical calculating appliances and of sorting and tabulating machinery not only advantageous but essential in dealing with many classes of returns. The opportunities afforded for examining such appliances have been of much service to those in whose work the introduction or extension of their use affords a promise of increased efficiency combined with the greatest economy obtainable.Scope of the Work of a Statistical Office.In view of the appearance in official documents of suggestions that statistical work is limited to the simple collection and com-compilation of figures, the Conference ,has regarded i.t as desirable to emphasize the fact that the arithmetical work of a statistical office constitutes only the preparatory and less important stage of the Avork of such, an office, and that if this principle be ignored the more important services Avhich thorough statistical work is capable of rendering to the community will be sacrificed.Procedure and Results of the Conference.The resolutions of the Conference have, in most cases, been adopted without a dissentient voice. When an opposing view has been pressed to the vote, there has been in no case any substantial number of votes recorded against the proposition as ultimately submitted for decision. In those few cases in which the opinions of delegates appeared at first to be almost evenly divided, further discussion enabled the Conference to arrive at conclusions with substantial unanimity. - &apos; &quot;&apos;The delegates desire to place on record that quite apart from the actual resolutions which have been formulated and adopted, the Conference has had great value in furnishing opportunitycare to the examination of tlie details. This report is com-inended by the Conference to the Governments concerned for their ^favourable consideration. A recommendation has also been made for the establishment, in any Colony or Protectorate not possessing an adequately organised statistical office, of a Statistical Council to be charged with the general supervision of the collection and compilation of the statistics of the Colony or Protectorate. The Conference has recommended this proposal for the consideration of the Colonial Office.
for an exchange of views between the representatives of the different countries, and of the different departments of the Home Government, in reference to the work in which they are engaged.   The discussions, formal and informal, have not only thrown new light upon conditions and difficulties peculiar to each section,  but have evoked  mutual sympathy and have, above all, enabled the magnitude of the interests that all sections of the British Empire have in common to be appreciated, and revealed the ties which bind together the Statistical Departments.   While the resolutions adopted aim, in the main, at co-ordination and cohesion in form, the Con-ference has succeeded in securing to a pronounced degree, on this the first occasion on which its members have had the advantage of direct personal intercourse, a mutual confidence and a desire for mutual co-operation.   If one thing has been noticeable more than any other in the proceedings of the Conference, it lias been the desire of each representative, while emphasising quite naturally his own point of view and exercising his own judgment, to bear in mind the interests and conditions of parts of the Empire other than his oavii, and to be content, in order that a common ground of agreement may be reached, to give up some points that, for his own purposes, he would like to retain.   The Conference believes that its members will return to their ordinary work with increased keenness and interest.Convinced of the great benefit which has been afforded by the Conference to the statistical work of the countries con-tributing to it, the delegates desire to record their opinion that it would be of advantage to summon a similar conference to meet after a suitable interval, not more than five years, when in addition to a review of the field of work which has engaged the attention of this, the first Conference, opportunity may be taken to deal with a number of important subjects omitted or not fully considered on the present occasion.On behalf of the Conference,A. W. Flux,26th February, 1920. Chairman.
% PART II.TEXT OF THE RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THECONFERENCE.Section I.-The proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau.The Conference, having fully considered the question of the establishment of a Statistical Bureau for the British Empire, has adopted the following series of resolutions : The Establishment of a Statistical Bureau for the British Empire.1. There should be established in London, at the earliest possible moment, a Central Bureau of Statistics for the British Empire, adequately equipped and staffed, for the purpose -of obtaining, collating, examining and publishing statistics which/ bear upon the conditions and resources of the Empire, the common interests of its members and their relations with the rest of the world.Functions of the Bureau.2. The general function of the Bureau should be to obtain, co-ordinate, analyse and publish statistical information relating to the whole of the British Empire. Such statistical information would cover, hut would not be limited to, the following:  Demography, Labour, Industrial and General Social Statistics, Production, Commerce (foreign and domestic), Transport and Communication, Finance (including Currency and Banking) and Public Administration.In order to perform this function efficiently the following methods would be adopted: (a) The Bureau would in the first place receive copies of all official statistical reports prepared within the British Empire and preserve such reports for reference in its library, becoming thus the central repository of statistical information, for the Empire.  It would be in a position to obtain special data from time to time from the officers concerned, and would also arrange to be supplied with copies of all forms of inquiry used by any statistical authority within the Empire for the purpose of securing statistical material. (6) The examination of the statistics collected in the various units would indicate what variations in form, or additions, were desirable in order to render the results comparable, and to facilitate, the preparation of the publications for which the Bureau would be responsible. From time to time, therefore, the Bureau would communicate suggestions to the statistical authorities concerned for their consideration within
the limits imposed by statutory or other local con-ditions.   The Conference nas every reason to believe that suggestions made by such a Bureau for the amplification or improvement of statistics would be adopted whenever practicable, (c) If organised as suggested below, the Bureau would ordinarily be in direct and constant touch with the Central Statistical Office, if any, in each country, and might also communicate, when desirable, with other statistical departments.   It would thus provide the co-ordinating link between the various statistical organisations throughout the Empire, and would be a body to which all statistical offices in the Empire could refer.   It would be in a position to furnish advice as to methods for the tabulation, mechanical or otherwise, the analysis and the presentation of statistics.   The Conference believes that the profes-sional assistance obtainable from a Central. Bureau of tliis character would he much appreciated and Avould prove of great value. (d) The Bureau would endeavour to co-operate with any other bodies engaged in collecting statistical material from the various parts of the Empire in such a manner as to ensure that there should be the least possible overlapping or duplication of statistical work.Publications of the Bureau.3. The Bureau should undertake a series of publications of the following character : -(a) An annual statistical review of the Empire, in arrange-ment following the lines of the official year-books already  published   in various Dominions, which would not only bring together the statistics supplied by the various countries of the Empire in a correlated and aggregated form, but would contain interpre-tations based upon or illustrated by the statistical data included in the volume, and would survey the resources, development and activities of the Empire. The Conference is convinced that the value of such a review will be largely due to the presentation of an authoritative statistical survey of the Empire within a moderate compass, and therefore recommends that the year-book should be limited to a single volume of convenient size, even at the sacrifice of detail.(b) Annual   abstracts of  the more important   Empirestatistics, and quarterly abstracts designed to provide the most recent data available in regard thereto.(c) Periodical monographs embodying statistics of trade,production, transport,  communication, population,.
labour and industries, finance, or any other matters which may be found desirable for the purpose of assisting the study of social and economic conditions and progress in the Empire.Incorporation and Constitution of the Council.4. A Council should be incorporated by Royal Charter, consisting of (a) the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who should be President in his capacity as ex-o/Jkio President of the Imperial Conference ;(6) members nominated by the several Governments assent-ing to these resolutions in the following proportions, viz., United Kingdom, 10 members; India and the self-governing Dominions, 2 members each ; Colonies and Protectorates, 2 members ; one of the members so nominated should be Vice-President of the Council and should preside in the absence of the President.Functions of the Council.5. The functions of the Council should be (a) to exercise, on behalf of the Governments which itcollectively represents, responsibility for and control over the general administration of the Bureau;(b) to control the expenditure of the Bureau, and to beresponsible for that expenditure to each of the Governments contributing thereto.6. The Council should appoint a permanent Advisory Committee, which should include not less than 12 members of the Council, and the Chairman of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau. The Advisory Committee should have power to co-opt other persons as occasional members, including, for example, representatives of economic, commercial, industrial, and financial interests in important parts of the Empire.Functions of the Advisory Committee.7. The functions of the Advisory Committee should be-(a) to assist the Director by affording him the benefit of informed outside opinion as. to the value of statistical work already undertaken or recom-mendecl to be undertaken in the interests uf the Empire;(6) to keep the Director in touch with the various official, commercial and financial interests of all parts of the Empire ;(c) generally, to advise the Director in connection withthe discharge of his duties.
Directing Stall of the bureau.8.-(a) The Bureau should consist of a Director, an adequate number of chief professional assistants, and such other technical and clerical assistants as may be necessary for the efficient conduct of the duties entrusted to it; and should be organised by and be under the personal supervision and control of the Director, who should be responsible for its conduct to the Council.(b) The Director should be both an expert statistician and a man of approved administrative and official experience and. ability; and should be appointed by the Council after consul-tation with the Governments assenting to these resolutions.(c) The appointment of any person to be Director should be made subject to review in such manner and at such times as may best secure that he commands the continued confidence of the Council and the Governments represented thereon.(d) The emoluments of the Director should be at least equivalent to those cf the Permanent Secretary of a Department under a Secretary of State of the United Kingdom; and the emoluments of his chief professional assistants should he at least equivalent to those of officers of the grade of Assistant Secretary in such a Department. The term emoluments should include consideration of pension rights.(e) The Director should be Chairman of the Advisory Committee.Interchange of Staff.9. In order to effect an actual and effective liaison between the Central Bureau, India, and the various Dominions, the Director of the Bureau should endeavour to. secure some members of his staff for determinate periods from the statistical staffs of Indian and Dominion Statistical Offices, by arrange-ment between himself and the chief statistician of each country, with the consent of the Government concerned : and similarly, officers of the Bureau may by arrangement be seconded for work in the Indian or a Dominion Statistical Office, subject in all cases to the payment by the employing office of such suitable allowances, in addition to salary, as may be agreed upon as being equitable in the circumstances.Preparation of Royal Charter.10. The Conference is of opinion that if the scheme for the establishment of the British Empire Statistical Bureau be approved by the various Governments of the Empire it would be of advantage that representatives in London should be appointed without delay after such approval to settle all necessary details in connection with the preparation of the Royal Charter.Note,-The Conference does not wish the outline of the work and scope of the Bureau, which it has indicated above, to be regarded as in any sense a final determination of the matter,
since it ft fully aware that modifications may he necessary from time to time, and that development and extension are certain. The Conference suggests, however, that the constitution of the Bureau should not be altered in any material points for a period of at least five years from the date of the present Conference, and that, if practicable, a further Conference, similar to the present one, should then be held, to review the work of the Bureau and to consider whether any changes are desirable in its constitution or functions.The Conference, while not in. a position to make a close estimate of the initial annual outlay for the maintenance of the Bureau, is of opinion, that a sum of about 30,000L will be required for the first complete year of its existence. A con-siclerable part of this sum will be for the provision of necessary equipment and of the essentials of an adequate technical library.The money necessary for the maintenance of the Bureau should be provided by joint contribution from the various countries concerned in its establishment, in proportions to be agreed upon. For example, one basis of apportionment before the Conference gave the following figures:        ^11. The Conference desires to place on record its opinion that the functions of no statistical office can be exercised properly when limited to the initial work of collecting and compiling figures. The Conference is agreed that the pre-scription of so- narrow a function has resulted in the past, on the one hand, in a tendency to an unintelligent massing of undigested statistical material, compiled at a considerable and often wasteful expenditure of labour and money, and on the other hand, in a failure to render information which is of value readily available for public use.The Conference, therefore, accepts the view that a statistical office should include within its functions : (a) The presentation of the results of its compilations primarily in such a form as clearly to indicate their essential elements, with or without supplementary detailed information, which, though necessarily secured in the process of compilation, need not be published unless it serves a sufficiently useful purpose.United KingdomIndiaCanadaAustralia     -        -New Zealand South Africa -Colonies and Protectorates .16,000 4,000 3,250 2,000 1,000 1,750 2,000Section II.-General Statistical Work. Functions of a Statistical Office.
(b) The utilization of the special knowledge and experience gained in the course of the work of tabulating the statistics, and the critical analysis of the results in such a way as to indicate most clearly their value and significance.(c) The elimination in every section of public statisticsbrought under review of those elements which when properly examined are found to serve no satisfactory purpose.Publication of Questionnaires.12. The Conference recommends that statistical offices, when reporting the results of any census or other statistical inquiry, should publish the more important questionnaires used in connection therewith. By this means the value and signifi-cance of the tables presented in any report can be more accurately assessed not only by members of the public but by other statistical offices interested.Voluntary aud Compulsory Returns.13. The Conference affirms its opinion that the accuracy of statistical information secured by means of voluntary or optional returns is open to serious doubt. The Conference therefore recommends that whenever a Government calls for statistics on any subject or series of subjects it should confer the necessary statutory authority upon its officers for their collection.Colonial and Protectorate Blue Books.14. The Conference has received from the Blue Books Com-mittee a report, dated February 24th, 1920,.making detailed comments and recommendations as to the form and content of the Blue Books prepared in the various Colonies and Protector-ates of the Empire, and the Conference recommends the proposals contained in this report for adoption by the Governments concerned.Improvement of the Statistical Organisation in certain Colonies and Protectorates.The Conference recommends for the consideration of the Colonial Office: 15. That in all Colonies and Protectorates not possessing an adequately organised statistical office there should be insti-tuted at the earliest possible moment a Statistical Council comprising: (a) the Colonial Secretary;(o) the Collector General or the principal Customs Authority ; (c) one or two other officers of standing and experience ;to deal with all questions affecting the statistics collected and compiled in the Colony or Protectorate.a  10170   &apos; R
16. That, subject to the general control of the Colonial Office, the proposed Statistical Council should be the medium by which the recommendations of the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau are carried into effect in each Colony and Protectorate.17. That the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau should provide facilities for enabling any officer nominated by any such Statistical Council to acquire a knowledge of modern methods of statistical practice and technique.Section Ill-Trade Statistics. Statistical Year for Trade Purposes.18. Having reviewed all aspects of the matter the Conference is of opinion that, for the purposes of general Empire com-comparisons, the calendar year should be adopted for trade statistics for all parts of the Empire; and that, except where there is some strong objection arising from local conditions, the adoption of the calendar year for this purpose should be general.Valuation of Imports and Exports for the purpose of Trade Statistics.19. The Conference has ascertained that the existing methods of valuing imports in the various countries of the Empire fall into three main divisions, between which important differences exist. They recognise that these differences are largely due to varying fiscal legislation, and that reasons of fiscal policy may delay, if not entirely prevent, the alteration of the systems now in force, but they consider it extremely desirable that a uniform method, of valuing imports and exports should be adopted throughout the Empire. They urge, there-fore, that for statistical purposes, even if the maintenance of a. separate record is involved, imports should be valued as at arrival in the importing country, exclusive of landing charges (c.i.f.), and exports as at the place of dispatch, from the exporting country, including loading charges (f.o.b.).Registration of Imports and Exports by Countries.20.-(a) The Conference considers that it would be of advantage if, in addition to statistics on any other basis, statistics of imports&apos;classified under countries of origin were available throughout the Empire.(6) The Conference recognises, however, that it is impracticable-able for all parts of the Empire to adopt the same principle as regards the countries to which imports and exports are credited. It recommends that inquiry should be made in those parts where at present only countries of shipment are recorded as to whether it would not be possible to classify imports under countries of origin or of consignment; and exports under countries of final destination.
(e) In all cases where it is found possible to adopt a new classification of foreign trade by countries, records on both the old and the new systems should, in the opinion of the Conference, be continued for a sufficient period to ensure the continuity of comparable records. .Distribution of Staple Commodities.21. The Conference recommends that special studies should he made, either by the British Empire Statistical Bureau or Otherwise, of the distribution of staple products of Empire origin.Uniform List of Countries.22. In order to ensure uniformity in the geographical limits assigned to the various countries which are distinguished for the purpose of trade statistics, the Conference, recommends that the &quot; List of Countries and Ports &quot; used in the United Kingdom,, with the periodical list of amendments thereto, should be supplied to the principal statistical authorities throughout the Empire, and the classification shown therein should be generally followed, whether in full detail or in a condensed form.Transit and Transhipment Trade,,23. The Conference is of opinion that records of Transit and Transhipment Trade, in which the two categories are clearly distinguished, should be kept throughout the Empire.Uniform Classifications of Imports and Exports.24. The Conference, having examined the.scheme prepared by the International Conference held at Brussels in 1.910 for the uniform classification of import and export statistics, and other suggestions laid before it with the same object, does not consider that any single scheme could usefully be recom-mended for adoption by all parts of the British Empire, but regards it as highly desirable that, in order to facilitate aggregations and comparisons of trade statistics throughout the Empire, several schemes of classification should he prepared, under which the more important commodities could be arranged with reference to the particular object in view. Alternative&apos; classifications might be based, for instance, on the origin of the commodities, on their component materials, or on their purpose or use. It appears to the Conference that this work could best he undertaken for the British Empire by the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau, which would be in possession of the statistics to he compared and in communication with the countries concerned.Imports and Exports of Precious Metals.25. The Conference does not think it desirable at the present time to recommend any change in the methods adopted by the different countries of the Empire for recording imports and exports of gold and silver bullion and specie.B 2
Government Stores.26. The Conference recommends that imports and exports on Government Account, whether recorded separately or not, should be shown under the ordinary headings in such a manner that the total imports and exports of each article are brought together.Parcel Post.27. The Conference recommends that imports and exports by Parcel Post, and by Registered Letter Post when the nature of the article is disclosed, should, if possible, be so classified as to be assignable to the proper import and export headings, as well as to the countries involved.Explanation oi Basis of Trade Returns.28. The Conference considers it of the utmost importance that all trade returns should be accompanied by prefatory notes explaning the basis on which the statistics are compiled, with special reference to the following among other points: (a) A definition of the statistical year, and a statement ofthe trade period actually covered by the tables.(b) The scope and nature of the statistics, e.g., whether&quot;imports&quot; represent total imports, including goods warehoused under bond, or &quot;net imports,&quot; &quot;re-ex-ports&quot; being ,deducted or &quot;imports for home con-sumption &quot;; and whether &quot; exports&quot; represent domestic exports only or include &quot;re-exports.&quot;(c) The manner in which special classes of imports and exports are dealt with, e.g., Government stores and material for public works; imports on behalf of foreign, diplomatic, and consular officials ; passengers&apos; and settlers&apos; effects, dutiable and free; ships&apos; stores; goods sent or received by parcel post, dutiable and free; fish caught in territorial waters ; bullion and specie ; precious stones ; containers and packing-materials.id) The system of classifying commodities by classes, groups, &amp;c.(e) The countries to which imports and exports are credited, i.e.:Imports-whether to-(1) Country of origin, (2) Country of consignment; or (3) Country of shipment. -Exports-whether to (1) Country of consignment or final destination; or12) Country of shipment.
(/) Methods of ascertaining and verifying the descriptions and quantities of imports, exports and re-exports; whether weights specified are gross or net; units of quantity and value used, especially where they deviate from imperial standards ; methods of valuing imports, exports, and re-exports respectively.(g) Special returns included, e.g., dutiable goods warehousedand delivered for home consumption, for ships&apos; stores,, or for exportation; stocks in bonded warehouses;, customs revenue from import and export duties, fines,, &amp;c.; trade of particular ports or districts.(h) The explanation of any special terms or contractionsused in the returns.Indication of Office responsible for Trade Returns.29. The Conference considers it is desirable that intro-ductory notes to trade and other returns should be signed or accompanied by an indication of the office responsible.Issue of Monthly Trade Returns.30. In the opinion of the Conference it is desirable that each colony and protectorate should issue monthly a statement showing imports into and exports from that colony and pro-tectorate where this is not already done, it being left to each colony and protectorate concerned to issue the statement in such detail as seems necessary.Section IV.-Production Statistics.The Conference has adopted the following recommenda-tions: (A) Statistics of Agriculture and Fisheries. Agricultural and Pastoral Production.31. In view of the high importance of statistics of agricul-tural production in regard to food and raw materials, it is desirable that the various countries of the Empire should attempt the systematic collection annually of statistics of areas devoted to agricultural and pastoral production, numbers of live stock and, as far as practicable, of agricultural and pastoral productions.Forests and Forest Produce.32. The systematic collection of statistics regarding the forest areas in the various countries, as far as ascertainable, and of the annual outturn of timber and all other forest produce should similarly be attempted.Quinquennial Census to supplement incomplete Annual Returns.33. Where and so far as complete annual.returns of produc-tion may not he practicable, the annual statistics should be
supplemented by a complete census of the total quantity and value of agricultural and pastoral production at least once in five years. &apos;Prices and Seasonal Movements.34. Price quotations of agricultural produce and state-ments of crop movements during the season should be collected periodically at appropriate intervals in all parts of the Empire, the frequency and basis of the record being arranged in agree-ment with the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau.Crop Forecasts.35. Crop forecasts should, where possible, be made for the more important crops in each part of the Empire.Reports on the foregoing Subjects.36. The proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau should not merely collate and tabulate the material recei ved under the foregoing resolutions, but should also undertake its co-ordina-tion, analysis and publication with such reports thereupon as may be found desirable.Fisheries.37. Statistics should be obtained in as full detail as possible of the annual production of the inland and sea fisheries of each part of the Empire.Returns of Stocks.38. The various Governments should, so far as possible, obtain for official use, and for transmission to the proposed statistical bureau, periodical returns of stocks of the principal agricultural and pastoral products and the course of supplies ; Birch statistics should not be published without the consent of the Governments concerned.Land Tenure and Irrigation.39. On the formation of the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau immediate steps should be taken to secure: (i) definite information and statistics as to-(a) the main outlines of systems of land tenure and land settlement;(b) systems of irrigation ; and(ii) estimates of the extent of land capable of being broughtinto agricultural and pastoral use,and the Bureau in publishing this information in a co-ordinated form should present a general analysis and survey of the statistics available, the systems in vogue, and generally in regard to questions affecting the occupation and development of the land viewed from the broad standpoint of the British Empire.
Agricultural Values.40. Returns of the total value of the agricultural and pastoral production of each part of the Empire are required to enable calculations to be made of (a) the value of the products to the producer;(b) the commercial value of the products to the country. 41. The best basis for ascertaining the value to the produceris a system of returns from each occupier, but where this is impracticable, the valuation of the total produce should be made from the best statistical data available.4?. In the calculation of the products which go into consump-tion, deductions should be made&apos; from the gross produce for such of their products as are used by producers for feeding of stock, for seed, or for manure.43. The commercial value of farm products should be as nearly as possible based on the wholesale prices ascertained at the markets nearest to the points of production.44. The complete valuation to be made quinquennially should relate to the actual production in the year of the census.Seasonal Variations of Agricultural Production.45. The variation from the average production in the year of the census should he calculated from such statistical data as are available.46. Where satisfactory returns of the actual production of a crop are not available, the seasonal variation of production for any year should be calculated from the data obtained from typical areas.Similarly, where complete returns of other agricultural products are not available, calculations should be made on the basis of special inquiries in a limited number of typical areas.Agricultural Year.47. The year to which the quinquennial census relates should be. so far as possible, the same for all parts of the Empire, and it is suggested that the 12 months commencing 1st September, or the agricultural year most nearly approxi-mating to that period in each country, should be generally adopted.Date of Quinquennial Census of Agriculture.48. A quinquennial agricultural census should in any case coincide, so far as possible, with a population census, and a census should, if possible, be taken throughout the Empire for the year 1920-21, and if that is impracticable, in 1921-22 ; the following census should in any case be taken in 1925-26.
(B) Statistics of Mining and Quarrying.49. Statistics of production, labour and finance of mines and quarries, and cognate subjects, should continue to be obtained in each country to the fullest extent possible, and the question of co-ordinating the whole or any part of such statistics shculd be undertaken by the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau in co-operation with the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, so as primarily to avoid the duplication of returns and the duplication of the work required in the aggregation thereof.50. (a) The value of mine products for statistical purposes should he that at the mine itself, regardless of any treatment that the product may undergo after leaving the mine.(b) For the purposes of statistics of production, mining production should he distinguished from reduction, smelting and other refining or treatment processes, statistics as to which should he included in statistics of factory production.51. Where local conditions in any country preclude any-such clear distinction, the statistics should definitely indicate the method of statistical presentation adopted.52. Where legal powers do not exist for securing statistical returns from mines, such powers should be provided, in order to secure adequate returns not only as to output, but as to&apos; machinery employed, the conditions and terms of labour,, accidents, and other cognate matters.(C) Statistics of Factory Production.53. Endeavours should be made in all parts of the Empire to obtain, annually if possible, or otherwise quinquennially, com-plete statistics of industrial (factory) production./)4. The question of the scope of inquiries into industrial production should be referred to the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau for advice.Section V.-Population Statistics.With reference to the Statistics of Population the Conference adopted the following Resolutions:  (A) Population Census. I-GENERAL. Census Period.55. That in the opinion of the Conference a decennial census is insufficient for modern statistical and administrative purposes, and that it should be the aim of the census authorities within
the Empire to take a census at intervals of not more than five years.Census Day.56. That all censuses within the Empire should he taken in the same year. That, while it may be desirable to secure uniformity in geographically associated portions of the Empire, the suitability of the date for the country concerned, having regard to its local requirements, is in general of more import-ance than absolute identity throughout the Empire, provided that the range of variation in respect of the several census dates is limited to a period of two months before or after the 15th April.De facto Population.57. That the procedure of each country should be such as to render available the total de fccto population of each country by sexes.Permanent Legislation.58. That in order to secure continuity of statistical policy in regard to censal and intercensal statistics it is desirable that census legislation in each part of the Empire should be placed upon a permanent basis.II-PARTICULARS OF INQUIRY. Divorce.59. That if particulars as to &quot; divorced &quot; persons are not separately ascertained it is desirable that such persons should be returned as &quot;widowed.&quot;Fertility.60. That in the case of each census authority proposing to obtain fertility statistics the arrangements should be such as to secure, in a closely comparable form, in addition to the ages of husband and wife: (i) Duration of marriage.(ii) Total number of children born alive.(iii) Total number of children still living.Uniform Classification and Listing.61. That the adoption of, uniform systems of classification and listing of industries and of occupations for census and other statistical purposes within the Empire is of the utmost importance.Occupation and Industry.62. (i) That in order to secure information as regards both industry and occupation, provision should be made on the census schedule for a separate reply on each subject.(ii) That it is desirable for Empire purposes to record particulars of unemployment.
Aliens.63. That the census authorities of the different countries of the British Empire should give special attention to the inquiries to be made with reference to aliens and persons of alien origin, with a view to securing as complete knowledge of such persons as possible.Infirmities.64. That in the opinion of the Conference the information hitherto obtained through the census with regard to infirmities has proved unsatisfactory.III.-PRESENTATION OF RESULTS. Classification to be based on defined System.65. That the classifications referred to in Resolution No. 61 should be based on two lists, the one of industries and the other of occupations, each heading being defined and given a reference number, and the headings should be so arranged as to be capable of grouping into classes according to a fixed and defined system.Basis of Industrial Classification.66. (i) That the basic principle of the industrial classifica-tion should be the product or type of service, and that of the occupational classification,- the process carried out, and the material worked in.(ii) That as regards the industrial classification, the principle of arrangement under the following heads be adopted, subject to any modification found necessary after detailed consideration of the further sub-division of these main groups. It should be a function of the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau to endeavour to define suitable sub-groupings of the main groups so as to provide for a uniform presentation of industrial statistics for Empire purposes.The main groups : 1. Primary production, including   agriculture, mines,fishing, forestry, &amp;c. 2. Secondary production, including treatment of rawmaterials and including manufacture. 3. Transport and communication, posts, telegraphs, &amp;c. 4.. Trade and commerce.5. Public administration, defence and professions. 6. Domestic services. 7. Other industries. 8. No industry.Basis of Occupational Classification.(iii) That, as regards the occupational classification, it is possible to present a tabulation in some such degree of detail as is given in the annexed illustration of the tabulation of metal workers (see pp. 29-30).
Applicability of the United Kingdom Classification to other parts of the Empire.(iv) That upon any agreement by the United Kingdom authorities with regard to the details of an occupational classifi-cation being arrived at, the results should be forwarded without delay to the various census authorities of the British Empire for their adoption, if found suitable.Glossary of Occupations.(v) That a complete descriptive glossary of occupations, with an alphabetical index in addition, should be prepared so soon as opportunity permits. Such a scheme could not be undertaken during the present Conference, and should normally be a matter for the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau.Presentation by Age, Sex and Conjugal Condition.67. That in regard to the presentation of statistics of (1) population and (2) births, marriages and deaths, thedistribu-tion should be shown by single years of age, in combination with sex and conjugal condition, in all parts of the Empire where the information is obtainable. This is. intended to apply to statistics of entire countries and not necessarily to sub-divisions thereof.Standard Death Rate.68. That for the purpose of comparability throughout the Empire it is desirable that the standard death rate be obtained on uniform lines by reference to common population distributions according to sex and age, the determination of both of which distributions might be referred to the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau.(B) Registration.Improvement of Vital Statistics.69. That subject to administrative requirements which are the more immediate objects of registration (births, marriages and deaths) machinery, it is desirable : (1) That all birth registers should contain a record of tjie age of each parent and the number of children previously born to the same marriage, distinguishing between those living and those dead. - (2) That statistics of still-births should be compiled in all parts of the British Empire wherever feasible. (3) That the conjugal condition of deceased persons shouldbe recorded in all death registers. (4) That the international classification of causes of death, as revised from time to time, should . be adopted for the purposes of tabulation of deaths.
70. (i) That the present system of open certification tends to prevent candid statements of the causes of death and thus introduces a systematic error into death statistics.(ii) That the error would he eliminated by a system of confidential certification.71. That in view of the national importance of vital statistics these statistics, wherever practicable, should be further developed by recording at birth registrations particulars as to the occupations and nationalities of parents, and the sexes and ages of their previous children, both living and dead, and at death registrations the occupation and nationality of the deceased and the sexes and ages of his (or her) children.Annex to Resolution 66 (Hi).Metal toorkers (not precious metals).Managers, superintendents, foremen, to a special heading unless a definite skilled trade is stated.

All other skilled workers in metal to be classed to other skilled workers.All unskilled workers and labourers to be classed to unskilled workers.All workers whose degree of skill is not known to be classedto-Miscellaneous workers (degree of skill unknown).(C) Migration.The Conference recommends: 72. That it is highly desirable that adequate statistics should be available showing clearly the movements of persons, both British and Foreign, between the various countries of the Empire and between the Empire and Foreign Countries.73. That in view of the fact that a general population census of the Empire will be taken in 1921, it is advisable that any systems which may be found practicable in order to achieve
the end advocated in Resolution No. 72 should be brought into effect before 1921, so that reasonably close estimates of population may be made whenever required on the basis of the census figures, the records of vital statistics, and the new records of migration.74. That the particulars required for records of migration should be secured, so far as local conditions permit, in the form of an individual record furnished by each person, which experience has shown to be a simple, accurate, and effective method of securing the requisite information.75. The information to be obtained should include information as to sex, conjugal condition, age, occupation, nationality (present and original), country of last permanent residence, and country of intended future permanent residence, the interpretation of permanent residence being left to the various Governments concerned.Section VI.-Prices and Index-Numbers.Retail Price Records.76. The Conference affirms the necessity for maintaining and publishing at not less than monthly intervals in every country of the Empire a systematic record of the retail prices of staple commodities, certainly the great staple com-modities, consumed as food or for other domestic purposes. The range of articles can with advantage be as wide as is found practicable, even though the utilisation of prices for such purposes as the calculation of index figures dealt with in resolution No. 78 may be limited to a narrower range.The Conference also recommends : Price Records for past Years.77. That in countries which hitherto have not made such systematic collections of prices special investigation should he directed to securing corresponding data for earlier years, not only for the purposes of records but for comparison with price variations in succeeding years.Fluctuations in the Purchasing Power of Money..&apos;. 78. That in each country of the British Empire a monthly index-number of retail prices be constructed which shall show, for that country the changes in the purchasing power of money.
Explanation of the Methods employed in the Construction ofIndex-Numbers.79. That in all cases in which an Index-Number is first issued or is revised by a Government Department, it should be accompanied by a statement of the methods employed and the data used in its construction, giving sufficient detail to permit oE its reconstruction by a reader; but that when subsequently issued a reference to this statement, together with a statement of fresh data employed would meet all essential requirements.Commodities selected need not be identical for all Countries.80. That in obtaining price-indexes for the different countries of the British Empire the list of commodities whose prices serve as the basis should, for each country, be selected so as to give the most representative index for that country that can be secured for the particular purpose in view, and that it is not desirable that the list should be identical and co-extensive for all the countries and for all purposes.Method of constructing Index-Numbers.81. That the index-numbers should be so constructed that their comparison for any two dates should express the proportion of the aggregate expenditure on the selected list of representative commodities, in the quantities selected as appropriate, at the one date&apos;, to the aggregate expenditure on the same list of commodities, in the same quantities, at the other date.Adjustment of Index-Numbers to provide for changes in the character of National Consumption.82. That in view of the changing character of the national consumption in many countries, it is desirable to revise, from time to time, say at decennial intervals, the list of commodities and appropriate quantities on which Index-Numbers are based, and that when such revision takes place the Index-Numbers should be calculated on the. basis of both the old and the new list for the year in which the change occurs, and, if possible, for at least two years preceding and two years following the change.Section VII.-Labour Statistics.Labour Statistics should be compiled for the Empire as a whole.83. The Conference is of opinion that with respect to any statistics required to be obtained by the different countries having representation at any International Labour Conference, the material obtained by the. countries of the British Empire, being in any case communicated to the proposed British Empire
Statistical Bureau, may conveniently be prepared for pre-sentation to the International Labour Ofhce through the agency of the Bureau in any case in which direct presentation of the statistics is not specially desired by the Governments concerned.The Conference is further of opinion that information, the application of which to redistribution of labour may present advantageous opportunities to citizens of the Empire, should be available for Empire purposes not later than for general international purposes.Need for Improved Presentation, &amp;c, of Labour Statistics.84. The Conference realizes that the pressure of modern industrial conditions necessitates a far closer and more accurate study of statistics of labour than has been accomplished hitherto. It realizes that large quantities of statistical data have been secured in some cases, but affirms its opinion that with few exceptions the presentation of such data has left miich to be desired. It is of opinion, therefore, that, notwithstanding the fact that fundamental differences in local conditions make direct world-wide comparisons impossible, special attention should be given in the British Empire to this field of statistical inquiry, and accordingly recommends that statistics of as complete a character as possible should be obtained in each country of the British Empire bearing on the rates of wages and the earnings of workpeople, the hours of labour, the causes, duration and mode of conclusion of strikes and lock-outs, on employment, including unemployment, on industrial organisation, and on all other matters with a bearing on current labour conditions in so far as they are capable of statistical treatment.Definition of what is meant by &quot;Labour.&quot;85. The Conference recommends that these inquiries should extend not only to the conditions of labour in industrial estab-lishments. but also to those of commercial, agricultural, maritime, and other employment.Section VIII.-Statistics oS Finance. Budget and Debt Statistics.86. In the opinion of the Conference the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau should compile a statement presenting the budget and debt statistics of the Empire, with the items arranged in such groups as to facilitate comparison between different countries of the Empire. This statement should include national, provincial, municipal, and other local budgets.Statistics of Income and Capital.87. In view of the high importance of statistics of income and capital as indices of national welfare, the Conference
t    33recommends that wherever taxes on income or on estates of deceased persons are in force in the Empire, there should be prepared from the information available, either annually or at suitable intervals, such detailed statistics as are possible, with the object of throwing light on the national wealth and the distribution of property and income.Paper Currency and Bullion and Specie.88. In the opinion of the Conference it is desirable that there should be compiled for the various countries of the Empire the fullest information available relating to amounts and descriptions of currency in use, amounts of the note issues in circulation at fixed dates, stocks and movements of coin and &quot;bullion, and all other cognate details bearing on currency.Movements of Capital.89. In view of, the importance of tracing movements of capital into and out of each portion of the Empire, the Con-ference recommends that the proposed British Empire Statistical. Bureau should, for the guidance of the statistical authorities throughout the Empire, devote special attention to the study of the problem of identification and measurement of such move-ments, and should explore possible sources from which fresh, statistical material bearing on the question may he obtained.Monthly Statement of Banking Operations.90. The Conference considers that it is desirable to collect and to publish monthly statistics relating to banks on the basis of the standardised balance sheet recommended by the Cunliffe Committee adapted, so far as necessary, to the circumstances of each country.Note. The following is the form recommended by the cunliffe Committee: 10170
Proposed Monthly Statement to he published by Banks.Statement of the Average Figures of the Weekly Balance Sheets during the Month ofLiabilities.Sj   s.   d.   &amp;d.Capital:  Registered Subscribed Paid upReserve Fund -Current, Deposit, and other AccountsAcceptances  - -Endorsements, Guarantees and other obliga-tions -Notes in Circulation -Assets.Cash :-(1) Coin, Bank and Currency-Notes, and Balances with the Bank of England(2) Balances with London Clearing Agents and with other Banks, Bankers or Banking Companies in the United Kingdom(3) Items in transits.19d.

Index-Numbers of Prices of Securities.91. The Conference is of opinion that financial statistics should be regarded as including variations in the prices of securities, and that there should be constructed index numbers for various classes of securities grouped in such manner as&quot;may bring out the; full significance of each group.Financial Operations of Credit Institutions other than Banks.92. The Conference considers it desirable that statistics bearing on the financial operations of insurance, land, mortgage, investment, trust and financial companies generally should be included in the conspectus prepared by the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau so far as useful comparisons are possible.Insurance Companies and Friendly Societies.93. In &apos; the opinion of the Conference statistics of the operations of insurance companies and friendly societies should be obtained and published, so as to exhibit for each part of the Empire the facts relating to each branch, of insurance separately, e.g,, life (ordinary and industrial), accident, sickness, fire, marine, &amp;c. \Section IX.-Acknowledgments.94. The Conference wishes to place on record the invaluable assistance so ungrudgingly rendered by Sir Henry Rew, K.C.B., in regard to the resolutions connected with agricultural statistics.95. The Conference desires to record its appreciation of the generous hospitality extended to its members by the Government Hospitality Fund.96. The Conference desires to express its sense of in-debtedness to the assiduous labours of the Secretaries to the Conference, who have, by their untiring efforts, contributed in a notable degree towards rendering the deliberations of the Conference effective.97. The Conference expresses its appreciation of the eminent services rendered by its Chairman and its admiration for the way in which he has conducted the meetings and has condensed the point at issue in such form, that decisions could be readily arrived at.
.  APPENDIX I.Report of the Committee appointed to examine Colonial and Protectorate Blue Books.The Chairman, British EmpireStatistical Conference. Sir, 24th February, 1920.1. We understand that the task entrusted to us by the Conference was mainly that of considering the Report of the Colonial Office Committee of 1917-18 on Colonial Blue Books and the subsequent correspondence between that Department and the Board of Trade, and of making recommendations as to the form and content of those blue books.2. We have held six meetings, during which we have con-sidered those questions with due regard to the views expressed from time to time by the Conference on the various branches of statistics contained in &apos;the blue books, and in our delibera-tions we have made use of the experience which several of our members possess of actual conditions in the Colonies and Protectorates.3. We recognise that in most cases the blue books con-stitute the repository of the leading statistics as to the position and progress of the Colony, but we observe that they also contain returns which are not of a purely statistical character. We have not thought it within our province to attempt rigidly to discriminate between the matter which can be regarded as purely statistical and that which has mainly an administrative value. We have accordingly placed on record our views on each of the chapters of the blue hooks dealt with by the Colonial Office Committee without endeavouring to distinguish between statements which are mainly of value to the admis-trator and those which are of interest to the statistician. Many sections of the blue books which, may have small value for the purposes of comparative statistics may be regarded by the local administrations or by the Colonial Office as of considerable importance for other purposes and the recommendations which we make below must be subject to over-riding considerations of this nature.4. It may be well to point out that, whilst in considering the Blue Book Committees Report, we have had in mind the desirability of some standard to which all Colonies should conform so far as possible, we recognise that allowance must be made for local deviations from any standard in view of the varying conditions of Colonies, which range in size from a few square miles to vast territories, which differ in climate from semi-arctic to tropical, and which may cover huge uncultivated areas or may possess a highly intensive system of agriculture. It would be unreasonable to require from Colonies whose blueAPPENDICES.
books are prepared in manuscript only returns identical with those required from Colonies which already possess a well-developed system of Ideal statistical publications. Whilst, therefore, it is our duty to lay down some standard, we feel it necessary to point out that considerable latitude must be allowed in its application to individual Colonies. Such local deviations from the standard are matters for discussion in each case between the Colonial Office and the Board; of Trade, or the new British Empire Statistical Bureau if and when it comes; into being,5. In dealing with the subject-matter of the Blue Books Oommittee&apos;s Report, we have found it convenient to take seriatim the recommendations made in Appendix I. on pages 10 etseq. of that report. ..    . .6. As to the recommendations under the heading &quot; general,&quot;&apos; we agree that it is of importance that the1 sections of the Blue Books dealing with (a) Imports and Exports, and (b) Shipping,1 should be published promptly without waiting until the remainder of the returns are ready. We think that no Colony should find any difficulty in completing these returns by the second week in February in each year, as proposed by the 1917-18 Committee, but if in any individual cases this is impracticable the delay should not be great. The preparation of the section dealing with production and natural resources should be pressed on so as to follow the sections dealing with-imports and exports, &amp;c., as soon as possible. 57. We have devoted considerable attention to the suggestion that the utility of the Blue Books might be enhanced by the reduction in size from folio to octavo. We observe from the enclosure in the Board of Trade letter of July 25th, 1918, to the Colonial Office, that there are objections to the proposed change, and we realise that in some of the smaller Colonies there may be technical difficulties in the way of reducing the size of the Blue Book. On the whole, however, we do not dissent from the conclusion of the earlier Committee, provided the change is not made compulsory.8. The recommendation that the calendar year should be adopted for all returns of trade statistics has been accepted by the Conference.9. In. Colonies where local currencies are in operation we think it desirable that sterling values should be shown in all important totals and in summary tables, the rate of conversion^ being based on twelve monthly quotations. Provided this average rate is clearly shown, we see no reason why individual items should not be entered in local currency.10. We agree with the recommendation that the standards of weights and measures used in all returns should be, so far: as the oustom of local trade permits, the;weights and measures adopted in the trade returns of the United Kingdom. ;.
11. We are in agreement with the proposal of the Colonial Office Committee that the term &quot; United Kingdom,&quot; should he substituted for &quot; Great Britain,&quot; and that the term &quot; Other parts of the British Empire &quot; should replace the term &quot; Other Colonies.&quot; If, however, the Conference consider it desirable that separate figures should be given as to direct trade with Ireland, we do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining the requisite figures for publication.12. We also find ourselves in accord with a proposal which has been referred to us by the Committee on Trade Statistics, that the records of imports and exports should show not only total imports and total exports, but also imports for consump-tion in the country concerned and exports of its own produce. We also consider that returns of direct transhipment trade (i.e.,, of trade which is not registered as imports and exports) should he furnished if possible. :  .13. Turning now to the detailed recommendations as to the contents of various sections of the Blue Books, we find ourselves in agreement with the recommendations of the Colonial Office Committee under the heading of&quot; Taxes, Duties, and Other Sources of Revenue,&quot; and with those under the heading of &quot; Revenue and Exjienditure.&quot; The proposal under the latter heading as to the entries &quot; brought forward &quot; at the top of the page and &quot; carried forward &quot; at the bottom of the page seems, however, a matter of detail which can be left to individual Colonies to decide. As to &quot; Assets and Liabilities,&apos;&quot; the form proposed in Schedule B, page 18, of the Colonial Office Committee&apos;s Report seems quite suitable. Similarly, the Schedule C, as to &quot; Public Debt,&quot; will give the main relevant particulars ; but we suggest that the fourth column should be transferred so as to become the eighth, and that the heading &quot; When incurred and for what cause&quot; should be modified to read &quot; When incurred and for what purpose.&quot; We endorse the recommendations of the previous Committee in regard to the headings &quot; Military Expen-diture &quot;and &quot;Public Works,&quot; but we see no reason why Colonies which find it useful for local purposes to give complete returns for smaller items of expenditure under the latter head should not do so. Tho recommendations as to &quot; Political Franchise and Council and Assembly &quot; are also endorsed.14. We have devoted.some consideration to the desirability of retaining in the Blue Books the sections often very bulky-which relate to &quot; Civil Establishment &quot; and &quot; Officers who have given Security for the Discharge of their Duties.&quot; The value of these returns is mainly administrative and not statistical, and, in our view, therefore, the question of their maintenance and their inclusion in the Blue Book, or in a separate publication, is one for the Secretary of State for the Colonies to determine after consulting the various local Governments.15. The recommendations as to &quot;Trade Commissioners and Correspondents&quot; &quot;Foreign Consuls,&quot; and &quot;Population &apos;and Vital Statistics and Miscellaneous Numerical Returns&quot; and
as to the &quot; Ecclesiastical Return,&quot; call for no criticism from us, but we wish to point out that statements of population and vital statistics should follow any general lines which may be laid down by the Conference for returns from the various parts of the Empire generally.16. As regards the return dealing with &quot; Education, News-papers, and Reviews,&quot; we are of opinion that it is not necessary for statistical purposes to show the total attendance at each school, and we think that totals for each class of school should suffice. We are in accord with the other recommendations under this heading, and with those dealing with &quot; Government Publications, Newspapers, cfec.&apos;&apos;17. We agree with the recommendation headed &quot; Currency, Banking, Weights and Measures&quot; hut in Colonies where wide fluctuations occur in the rate of exchange, we recommend that monthly quotations should be shown in the blue book.18. In considering the recommendations in the paragraph headed &quot; Imports and Exports &quot; we have been guided mainly by the observations in the enclosure in the letter from the Board of Trade to the Colonial Office of 25th July, 1918, and by the resolutions of the present Conference as to trade statistics. We have examined certain draft tables submitted to us by the Board of Trade, and, subject to the following observations, we recommend their adoption as the standard forms for the returns of external trade in the blue books. In tables 1 to 4 the words &quot; including parcel post&quot; should be deleted; a new table (16) should be provided to furnish particulars of transhipment trade ; in table 9 the columns headed &quot;duty&quot; are unnecessary; a note should be added to table 10 showing that certain imports, other-wise dutiable, are admitted duty free on special grounds (e.g., as being imported on Government account, &amp;c.); table 12. should be extended to cover imports as well as exports.[Note-In the Model Tables annexed hereto (pp. 44-59) the foregoing recommendations have been carried out.]Generally, we approve of the various suggestions as to trade statistics in the Board of Trade memorandum referred to ; they appear to us to be largely covered by resolutions of the Conference or by recommendations in the present report, but it may be well to mention that, as regards the enumeration of articles in alphabetical order, we accept the Board of Trade view that the arrangement of items in the Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom&apos;8 should serve as a guide pending any revised grouping which may be proposed by the Empire Statistical Bureau, if and when it comes into being.19. We endorse the views of the Colonial Office Committee as to. the form of the returns in Blue Books dealing with 11 Shipping.&quot;20. We are also in accord with the proposed arrangement of returns as to &quot; Agricultural, Cultivated andUncultivated Lands,* A new system of classifying Imports and Exports in the trade Returns of the United Kingdom came into force on 1st January 1920.
Wages, &amp;c, and Manufactures, Mines and Fisheries,&apos;! but these should he in accordance, so far as local conditions permit, with any general recommendations of the Conference. We fear, however, that some of the returns proposed by the 1917-18 Committee may prove too elaborate for adoption without modification in many of the smaller Colonies.21. We append a copy of a letter (with Model Tables) from the Home Office on^ the subject of Crimi7ial Statistics, and approve the recommendations which it contains (see pages 60-62).22. We do not regard some of the details shown in the returns as to &quot;Hospitals,&quot; &quot;Lunatic Asylums,&quot; and &quot;Charitable and Literary Institutions,&quot; as having any statistical value, and the desirability of retaining them for administrative purposes is a question for the Colonial Office.23, We endorse the recommendations of the Colonial Office Committee as to &quot; Savings Banks and Friendly Societies,&quot; hut we suggest that, as regards savings banks, a note should be inserted stating the maximum amount which may be deposited in any one year, and in any one account.24. We see nothing to object to in the recommendations under the headings &quot; Meteorological Observations &quot; and &quot; Harbours.&quot;25. We endorse the recommendations under the heading &quot;Railways, Canals, Roads, Telegraph and Telephones, Post and Telegraph Statistics,&quot; but we are of opinion in regard to roads suitable for motor traffic that the total mileage only need be given. We are also in agreement with the recommendations under &quot; Steamship Services,&quot; but would suggest that this heading might be extended to include any regular air services which may he established in the future.26. The utility of a general alphabetical index on the lines of that contained in the Mauritius Blue Book and recommended by the Colonial Office Committee is obvious.27. We have also considered generally the other recom-mendations in the Report of the Colonial Office Committee of 1917-18, and its appendices, hut as they relate mainly to matters which are only indirectly connected with the work of the Statistical Conference, we do not think that observations are called for from us.We should like, however, to associate ourselves with the recommendation that the Blue Books should be carefully examined at intervals by a small standing committee, and we suggest that the Colonial Office might take advantage from time to time of the presence on leave of responsible officers from the Colonies and Protectorates to co-operate in the work of the proposed Committee of Examination.28. As a final remark on the documents submitted to us for examination we would observe that the recommendation as to migration tables contained in the last paragraph of the Board of Trade memorandum enclosed in the letter to the Colonial
Office of 25th July, 1918, appears to be adequately covered by earlier resolutions of the present Conference.29. We hesitate to submit for the approval of the Conference a series of recommendations covering One by one the points of detail which we have discussed, and we suggest that the Con-ference may be ready to dispose of the numerous points raised by passing a single resolution in the following terms: &quot; The Conference has received *from the Blue Books Committee a report, dated 24th February, 1920, making detailed comments and recommendations as to the form and content of the Blue Books prepared in the various Colonies and Protectorates of the Empire, and the Con-ference recommends the proposals contained in this report for adoption by the Governments concerned.&quot;30. We feel that in order to give effect to these proposals it will be necessary to strengthen the existing machinery for dealing with statistical matters in certain of the Colonies and Protectorates, and we accordingly submit for the consideration of the Conference the following further resolution: The Conference recommends for the consideration of. the Colonial Office: 1. That in all Colonies and Protectorates not possessing an adequately organised statistical office there should be instituted at the earliest possible moment a Statistical Council comprising: (a) The Colonial Secretary ;(b) The Collector-General or the principal CustomsAuthority;(c) One or two other officers of standing andexperienceto deal with all questions affecting the statistics collected and compiled in the Colony or Protectorate.2. That subject to the general control of the Colonial Office the proposed Statistical Council should be the medium by which the recommendations of the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau are carried into effect in each Colony and Protectorate.3. That the proposed British Empire Statistical Bureau should provide facilities for enabling any officer nominated by any such Statistical Council to acquire a knowledge of modern methods of statistical practice and technique.On behalf of the Committee,W. J. Glenn y J. T, Pratten, (Chairman). &apos;Secretary.

ANNEX No. 2 TO REPORT OF THE BLUE BOOKS. COMMITTEE.Criminal Statistics.Statistical Branch,Home Office, Whitehall, London, S.W., Dear Sir, 5th February 1920.. Youit note to Mr. Waller with regard to the tables of Criminal Statistics in Colonial Blue Books has been referred to me. Unfortunately I have been away for a few days and was therefore unable to reply by Monday last. Perhaps the following suggestions may not be too late to be of use to you. It would be very advantageous if the Colonial figures could be made comparable with United Kingdom statistics.I. observe that offences are shown in all four annual tables in the Jamaican Blue Book. 1 suggest that the titles of the offences be given uniformly in the first column of each table.  In the English, Scottish and Irish Criminal Statistics indictable offences are designated crimes, and all other infractions of the law are termed offences.  Lt would be convenient to observe this distinction in the Colonial figures, including the statistics for Colonies to which the legal difference does not apply.  It is not necessary for the Colonial figures to be given in such minute detail as in the English tables, but it is highly desirable that there should be no ambiguity as to the nature of the crimes and offences included in each of the several groups. A booklet&apos;;::&quot; of instructions containing classified list of crimes and offences is supplied to police authorities for their guidance in preparing the returns of crime; possibly a similar classified list might be of assistance to Colonial Officers when compiling statistics, and it would ensure uniformity in the statistics for different Colonies. I enclose a copy of the instructions&apos;&quot;&apos; to police authorities.I may mention that in the present tables for Jamaica the large figures for &quot; other offences,&quot; &amp;c., in each table need subdividing and defining.I do not feel able to suggest suitable groupings for the offences I think that must be governed by the peculiar con -ditions of each Colony, and.perhaps the most convenient course would be to leave it to the Colonial Officers, on the under-standing that whatever grouping of the offence is found desirable, the terminology, classification, and arrangement of the English statistics must be adhered to. The grouping of the headings should be uniform through all the criminal tables of a Colony.*,Not printed iu the present document.
I enclose drafts of revised headings for the four annual tables, reduced to three, which would probably occupy three pages as at present. I have not suggested any form for the comparative table, but it is generally understood that the most useful tables of this character are those showing for each year the number, of each description of crime committed, or the-number of persons dealt with or convicted for each description of offence, and that figures relating to results, procedure, &amp;c, are of less value.I may mention that the Treasury Committee on Official Statistics recommended the adoption of the calendar year for all statistics except financial statistics.1 am, dear Sir,Yours very truly,(Signed)     W. J. Farrant.
