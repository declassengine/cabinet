Military Secret.1351From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,mi March 1920.4018.   Secret.   Malleson wires between 18th March and 23rd March : 1. Bolsheviks have temporarily abandoned idea of sending troops to Baku owing to the unsatisfactory reply from Azerbaijan and lack of control of Caspian, and are concentrating troops on the line Askabad-Merv, where they are reported to have 22,000 men (? and) at least 300 machine guns, 2-4 armoured trains, and 25 armoured cars. Morale of troops on the whole good. Garrisons west of Askabad have been reduced to small proportions. Some of the troops in Merv are ear-marked for Kushk, and others for Sarakhs-Pul i-Khatun frontier.2. Transport in Askabad consists of 1,500 camels and some motor transport.3. Near Bajgiran Bolsheviks have established posts close to ours, and few stray shots have been fired by them. On. 20th instant one of our patrols was fired on without result east of Bajgiran.4. There is much talk of invasion of Persia in Askabad and Merv. The idea is not openly supported officially, but some officials are known to favour it. Most active supporters are Persian Bolsheviks backed by number of Turks, including Kasim Beg, who have recently arrived from Tashkend. Frunze, who reached Askabad with Eliava on 18th, is said to have encouraged leaders of this movement. The prevailing rumour is that invasion of Persia is to commence on 15th April, and that considerable number (corrupt group) troops are shortly coming from Tashkend for the purpose. There are already some Persian Bolshevik troops in Askabad who are being armed by Bolsheviks with miscellaneous collection of rifles.5. Notice issued by Persian officials in Daragaz, that there was no need to fear Bolshevik invasion as Persia was neutral, is laughed at by Bolsheviks as sign of weakness.6. Bolsheviks are circulating leaflets about necessity of freeing Persia.-7. There is also much talk of British invasion of Trans-Caspia not only in Trans-Caspia, but also in Meshed, Kuchan and elsewhere, where it is put about by Caucasian Turks who are apparently in touch with Askabad.   Malleson considers this is being clone to provide excuse for aggression.
