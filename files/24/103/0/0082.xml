N^/^^^^^^^^Iemorandura by the Shipping Controller. a. The memorandum by the Minister of Transport of March 31st(CP.1000) urges that the Cabinet decision under which the cost cf the coastal subsidy scheme is borne by the Ministry cf Transport on a Special Vote should be reversed tn the grounds that that Ministry has no control over the allocation of ships int$ the coasting trade, or over ships when they are in that trade;   also&apos; that the Ministry has no voice in the amount to be paid by way of subsidy.    The memorandum proposes that the present scheme should continue for four weeks from March 31st, and should then take the form of a direct subsidy to coastwise shipping administered by the Shipping Controller,2,        The -present scheme was drawn up by the President of the Board of Trade, the Shipping Controller, and the Minister Designate of TCays &amp; Communications to carry into effect a decision of the War&apos; Cabinet of the 4th July, 1919,    It was admittedly bad In principle, but was the best temporary expedient that could be devised to meet an emergenoy In view   ef the fact that Railways were carrying traffic at heavy loss and attracting traders to railway routes instead of steamship, which would net run at a loss,3,    ,    The Public Notice explaining the scheme stated that &quot;in &quot;consequence of the withdrawal cf coastwise steamers a large volume &quot;of traffic has been diverted from sea to rail with the result that &quot;the railways are now burdened with traffic which they have not &quot;previously carried,   s  s  it  There is urgent necessity to use to Hhe full the coastwise services, but they can only,be re-establishedjf&apos;&quot;on a pre-war footing by being assured of a reasonable amount cfIi iiregular traffic,   a  s  *   To meet these difficulties the War Cabinet have given directions to the Railway Companies that no &quot;goods which have been imported foreign, or which are intended for&apos;Lxnort foreign, shall be carried by rail between points which can;    be/
&quot;&quot;be effectively served in whole or part by coastwise carriage&quot;. Schedules of traffic were to be prepared and tqoods Included in theseschedules were to be carried coastwise at current freights and charges,-the difference between those current freights and charges and the amount of the corresponding railway rates being refunded by the Railway Executive Committee or their agent to the trader by whom the payment had been made,4, The object of the scheme   being to divert from the railwaystraffic which they were unable to carry, and the main cause of the-trouble being that the railway rat^s were too low, it was a natural arrangement that the oost should be borne by the Railway Vote.5, The amount of the refund is fixed by the scheme itself asbeing the difference between the current sea freight and the current railway rates, and the only financial control required or possible is to see that the proper amounts are charged.    The work of checking therefund claims Is carried out by local Committees consisting of-representatives of the Railway Executive Committee, the Canal Control Commission and the Port Authority, as well as of the Ministry of Shipping.    The machinery for checking the amounts of the refunds works satisfactorily,&apos; and there is no reason for disturbing the present arrangement so long as the scheme remains in operation.6,* The present position due to the operation of this schemeand to other causes,. Is that, including steamers carrying coal, there has been during recent months much more tonnage engaged in the coasting trade than ever before, but owing to the slow turn round in the ports there Is a loss in efficiency of at least one-third. All the berths of the regular coasting liners are occupied, and these vessels are fully employed.    Comparative figures of cargoes carried only exist in the oase of coal, and there is now, notwithstanding enormous detentions, as much coal being carried coastwise as before the war, viz:- about 1,600,000 tons per month.    This result is of course due not to the coastal subsidy scheme but to the special effort made
made to meet the coal emergency.    Nevertheless it shows that the statement that the coasting tonnage is not pulling its weight is not well founded.7.    There is more tonnage in the coasting trade than can be effectively used there in the present congested state of the-ports, but this condition is not one of the stable equilibrium, for if the coastal subsidy were withdrawn it Is certain that a great deal of the traffic which has been diverted to the steamers would again be attracted to the railways by the lower rates which still prevail on land,8.    The main cause of the difficulty has been throughout the artificially low level at which railway rates have been kept, and the recent increases that have been made in those rates have not made it possible for the coasting vessel to compete on . anything like terms of equality with the. railways.    The railway rates, which were competition rates, have not been raised to the proper level.   The Railway Rates Advisory Committee considered this question carefully but &quot;reluctantly came to the conclusion&quot; that they could riot deal with the anomaly at this stage.-9.    More than half of the cost of transport by sea is made up of terminal charges (wharfage, , cartago,- etc,) over which the Shipowner has no control, and If the new 16/- a day Is given to the dockers these terminal charges will be increased.   The cost of carrying tea by sea from London to Manchester is 80s9 10d. per ton, of which 44s. lOd. consists of terminal charges, and 36s* 0d* is the sea freight.   The revised railway rate i3 70s* 6d. or 10s. 4d* per ton less than the sea rate. *10.    It is impossible for a transport trade which is subject to the fluctuation of the&apos;labour and other markets to compete with another transport trade whose rates are fixed at an artifi-cially low level, and if the coasting trade is to continue topull
pull Its load and do its fair share of the transport business of tho country this inequality must be redressed,,11.    The remedy proposed in the ministry of Transport Memorandum, that a subsidy should be giver, to the coasting ships, implies that the inequality is to be continued but be balanced by a payment from public funds, and does not touch the cause of the trouble.    Shipowners themselves do not want a subsidy, as they -know its dangers;   and the suggestions in the Memorandum that Shipowners are unbusinesslike, given to profiteering, and are not pulling their load are not very consistent with a proposal to pay them public money.12&apos;t    Another remedy which has been suggested is that the whole of the railway system and the whole of the coasting trade should be placed in one hand with absolute power to send goods, by rail or sea as may appear best in the general interest1.    Apart from the fact that the control of shipping comes to an end with the Defence of the Realm Regulations at tho end of August, the experience of the war gives no reason to hope that a permanent solution can be found in this direction.   It would bo folly,15.     Probably there is no one complete remedy, but we can reasonably hops for a return to a state of stable equilibrium under which the coasting trade will do its part without any payment of any kind from the State if it is possible to reduce in some4measure the handicap which is now placed on that trade by artifi- , cially low railway rates.14.     It may not be an easy task, as the general body of traders will be opposed to any rise in the railway rates between ports, and the tendency of the good railway official must always be to attract traffic to the railway from the steamer; but it i3 believed that the only possibility of a permanent solution lies in this direction, and it ought to be possible for a Committee on which both shipping and railways were represented to settle from time to time what the railway rates between ports should be having regard to the ascertained cost of carrying the goods by sea&apos;,,
15i     If it is decided to examine the question from this point of view, it would he to the interest of tho railways that the present coastal subsidy scheme, should be continued for a short time while the examination is being made..(Signed)   J*P. MAC LAY,April 15 th 1920.
