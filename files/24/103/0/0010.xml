This document is the property of His Britannic Majestys Government.THE CABINET.THE VICTUALLING OP CONSTANTINOPLE IN THE EVENT OF A BREAKDOWN ON THE ANATOLIAN RAILWAY.MEMORANDUM BY THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.In the absence of the Secretary of State for War, I circulate herewith, for the    0152 consideration of the Cabinet, a Memorandum by the General Staff on the responsibility    5465 for feeding the population of Constantinople in case that city is cut off from its source of supply in Anatolia.PEEL.$1st March, 1920.With reference to telegram &apos;No. 232, dated the 15th March, from Admiral de Robeck, High Commissioner at Constantinople, of which a copy is printed below, the Army Council desire to point out that, in the event of Constantinople being cut off from its food supply, it will be utterly impossible for-the War Office to assume responsibility for victualling the civil population at Constantinople, which is estimated at about \\ millions.In view of the effect which it is anticipated will be created in Turkey by the publication of the intended terms of peace, the Army Council are unable to guarantee that General Milne will be able to retain the detachment at present situated at Eskishehir. If, as it appears to be anticipated, Constantinople will, as a result, be blockaded in respect of food by the Turkish Nationalists, the Army Council suggest that the Allied Governments should be consulted with a view to some organization such as the Supreme Economic Council being set up in order to undertake responsibility for the maintenance of the population of Constantinople. This seems advisable both in 1 order that the War Office may not be called upon to assume a responsibility which they could not discharge and of which it is undesirable that the British Government should alone bear the heavy financial burden.Decipher.   Admiral de Robeck (Constantinople).Despatched 15th March, 1920, 7.30 pan. (No. 232.) (Received 16th, 10 a.m.)Very urgent. General Milne is withdrawing all British troops from Anatolian Railway to vicinity of Constantinople, except the detachment at Eskishehir which he proposes to maintan there for the present. French troops, which were guarding French railways in Asia Minor, have already been withdrawn, and Italian battalion at Konia will also withdraw.It is consequently possible that traffic on Anatolian Railway may break down. Interruption will place Constantinople in very difficult situation with regard to food supply and every effort will be made to keep line open.At present there are approximately 19 days&apos; supply of wheat and flour in the town, with another 10 days&apos; supply due by sea within next fortnight. Further developments must depend on situation and cannot at present be foreseen.(B20/1B8)   100  4/20 H&amp;s  8091wo
