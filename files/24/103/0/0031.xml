Communications throughout the Empire, and I hope that it will receive early consideration by my colleagues.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,7th April, 1920.The urgent necessity for the improvement of Imperial telegraphic communications is generally admitted, and a wireless network is one important means to this end.The question which calls for immediate settlement is how this network is to be provided. There are only two agencies which can undertake such a scheme one the State and the other a Commercial Company such as Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company.There is at present in being a Committee the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee appointed by Lord Milner to consider the technical aspects of an Imperial wireless network, and it is understood that their report may he presented within the next month or two. On the other hand, Marconi s Wireless Telegraph Company, having already studied these technical questions, have submitted a considered proposal for an Imperia) wireless telegraph network which they are prepared to provide, man and maintain entirely at their own expense. They offer to pay to the State 25 per cent, of the net profits of the system, to hand over to the State at the end of 30 years the whole system free of cost and to complete 30 trunk stations within 3 years of the date of the grant of the necessary licences.In view of the terms of reference of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, their report can only contain recommendations as to the particular system of wireless to be adopted and the stations, which on commercial or strategical grounds, it appears desirable to erect, and estimates of traffic, capital cost, revenue, &amp;c. But Marconrs Wireless Telegraph Company have at least as great technical and indubitably greater practical knowledge of the purely wireless questions involved, while the stations they propose to erect would form such a complete network that it is most unlikely that the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee could usefully add to the number of stations suggested by the Company.The submission of the Marconi Companys proposal has therefore profoundly modified the situation which existed when the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee was appointed, and a decision on the main question as to whether the Imperial wireless telegraph network is to be provided by the State or by a commercial, company is one that brooks no delay.The acceptance of the Marconi Company&apos;s scheme would no doubt give the. Company something in the nature of a monopoly for a limited period, but at the same time the Empire would obtain without expense and at a comparatively early date the - wireless network which it is agreed is urgently required. In the present state of the country&apos;s finances it would be most difficult to defend the expenditure of the very large sums of public money which would be required to complete the scheme as rapidly as the Company undertakes to do, and the only possible course, if erection by ihe State(B20/107)   100  4/20  H&amp;S  8112wo
were decided on, would be to spread the expenditure over a considerable number of years and thereby again postpone the completion of a scheme which has already been subject to very serious and regrettable delay.Since the very early provision of this network is a matter of great importance, I would urge that the question should be considered by the Cabinet without delay.The two main factors in the situation are : (a.) Time. &apos; (6.) Money.From the point of view of the Empire the balance of advantage appears definitely to rest with the Marconi Company&apos;s proposal, which I recommend should therefore be accepted.
