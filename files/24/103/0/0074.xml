0f 274Kis 3?Y:znir.&apos;: Wi :\jcc/ty&apos;G Government.* CABIN S T.!RADE MONOPOLIES BILL AND PROFITEERING ACT (AMENDMENT) BILL* Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,It will be remembered that when tho Profiteering Aot was introduced in August 1919 an undertaking was givon that it would eventually be followed by legislation of a more permanent character,   fIn pursuance of this undertaking a Combines Bill was prepared and considered by the Cabinet Committee on   Trade Policy towards the end of last year but it was felt that the time was not then rip9 for such a measureo    Tho introduction of a Bill to amend the Profit-earing Aot was also considered, but it was finally decided to introduce at tho moment only a short Bill extending the duration of the   Aot for three months *    This was passed, tho understanding being that an amending bill would be introduced before the expiration of this further period.In view of the strong&apos; fooling now pervading tho country on tho subject of profiteering and tho power cf trusts and monopolies - a feeling which has been aocentxi-atod by tho publication of the Reports of Committees which have been appointed to make investigations in certain trades - I think it is impossible to delay any longer tho introduction of definite measures.     Indood tho matter is now one of urgency.After oareful consideration, I have oome to the conclusion that the only possible way of dealing with the situation is to introduce z% the samo time two separate measures? tho first and most important, a measure embody^ ing the permanent policy of His Majestyrs Government in relation to trusts or monopolies, and the second (in view of tho approaching end of tho Profiteering Aot, which expires on 19th May) of even greater urgency, a Bill to emend the Profiteering Act in suoh a way as to strengthen its provisions, and to make it more generally efieotiveoDrafts of these two measures are annexed hereto with short explanatory notes, and I should be glad to have tho sanction of the Cabinet for thoir simultaneous introduction into Parliament at the earliest possible date0RVSfcHOKKH.14th April, 1920,
This Bill, which is intended to embody the permanent policy of Lie Majesty1s Government as to Trusts end Trade Combinations, has &quot;been drafted in the light ef the experience gained in other countries and is modelled to some e::te.it on the general principles in regard to monopolies which are contained in the Railway and Canal Traffio Acts and the Patents and Designs Act, 1919,It will be remembered that Section 3 of the profiteering Act gave the Board of Trade certain powers for obtaining information as to, and investigating&apos;, the operations of Trusts and Combinations, but this provision Is not suffi-clent as a permanent measure and it is desirable to make more adequate provision for dealing with the problem.In view of the increasing tendency towards combination in many branches of industry it is most desirable that the Government should keep in touch with the development of such organisations and be in a position to publish the facts where it thinks that course advisable,   Both the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy (over which Lord Balfour of Burleigh presided) and the Committee on Trusts (appointed by the present Minister of Health when Minister of Recon-etruotion) recommended that permanent provision should be made for this purpose.in the belief that publicity would be a useful deterrent against possible abuse of monopoly powers.But it must be recognised that combination is an inevitable outcome of modern economic conditions, and can be very beneficial, and therefore it is desirable (1) that the administrative action to be taken should not be such as to imply any hostility on the part of the State to combination as such,, and should.-Jje limited to enquiry within olearly defined limits and.Wpablioily,? and (2) that the control imposed should be judicial, not administrative, and direated to restraining combinations and monopolies * :u from practices which will generally be regarded as objectionable.Clause 1 of the Bill therefore gives the. Board of Trade power to enquire into the nature, extent and effect of any monopoly or control exercised over any trade,, industry or business and the methods by which it is exercised.   The clause further gives the requisite powers for such enquiries as may be necessary and provides that information obtained shall be treated as confidential, subject however to the power of the Board to publish a report of the results of an enquiry if they think fit.Beyond the mere power - of enquiry it is felt that there should be some machinery by which redress may be obtained against what is in fact abuse of monopoly powers as defined in Clause 2 of the Bill;   and it is accordingly proposed that powers should be given to a quasi-judicial body, such as theRailway/I. TRADE MONOPOL IBS BILL.
Railwej and&quot;Oanal Commission, to hear complaints, whether-made &quot;by the Board of Trade or an a grieved party., and where there lias been an abase of monopoly power, to give an injunction against Its continuance.   Where the effect Df the monopoly is to oharge unreasonable prices, it is Provided that in such a ease the Commission may prohibit charges in excess of such reasonable, prices as may from time to time be approved by them,If the experience gained in connection with the Hallway and Canal Traffic Acts should be found to apply to the ease of other forms of monopoly, it is improbable that the above provision will in fact have frequently to be enforced.&apos;  The existence of the provision would in most oases be a sufficient deterrent,Power is given to the Board of Trade as well as to aggrieved persons to make complaints as it is doubtful whether any private person or persons would ordinarily have sufficient means to carry&apos;on an action against a -powerful trust,As regards the procedure before the Commission the provisions of the Hallway and Canal Traffic Act, 1880, will In substance apply.   Experience lias shown that the Commission, whioh has a judge *as chairman and persons with suitable technical qualifications for its other members, has worked w$ll in the particular sphere in which it was established and it is thought to be the most suitable body for the present purpose both because of its constitution and because of the ^decrease in the , work which it now has to perform.R.S.Borne,14th April, 19 80.

Trade Monopolies.DEAITOjP ABILLFor obtaining information with respect to trade monopolies and for restraining abuses thereof.CII.   (2.)9th April 1920.
iia mopiwRwcx amendment bill.In considering the attached draft of the Profiteering Amendment Bill it should he remembered that in profiteering the Government arc faced with an evil which, though probably small as a cause contributing to the increased cost of living, is yet in its psychological aspect of very considerable importance. It Is therefore essential that the Government should, do every--thing possible to check profiteering but it is at the same time of tho utmost importance that wo should do nothing to injure or impede the reviving trade on which ultimately depends the removal of the real and effective causes of the increased cost of living.The Bill is the result of most careful consideration as to (a) How best (having regard to the vital condition referred to above) tho existing powers of tho Government may ho strengthened; and(h) What nmendments have been shown to he necessary as a result of the 7 months experience of actual working of the Aot,So far as Trusts and combinations are concerned, it is proposed to take permanent powers in tho Trade Monopolies Bill, and therefore no new provisions relating to trusts etc, are included in the Profiteering Amendment Bill,The most important provision in the present Bill is in the first olavase which is designed to obtain the help of trade organisations In regulating prices for particular classes of goods.     In the caso of most trades public control of prices &apos; would involve a species of investigation and inspection which would he very costly to the Nation and very ineffective In result. It is hoped to secure the assistance of the Councils of the Woollen and Cotton Trades as well as others in regulating theftr own profits.Clause 1 accordingly gives the Board of Trade power to approve schemes submitted by persons engaged in a trade for the limitation of profits obtained from the manufacture or distri-bution of an article or class of articles,    Fhero a scheme has been so approved, rates of profit not exceeding such rates as are allowed&quot; under the scheme are not to ho deemed unreasonable for the purposes of the Profiteering Act,Clause 2 (1) extends the provisions of the Profiteering Act 1919 to the lotting on hire of articles and the offering to let articles on hire, a provision which was approved by the Trade Policy Committee,    It may, however, be pointed out that the further provision to extend the clause to the letting of furnished dwellings and lodgings which was likewise approved, has now been dropped&quot;as it is understood that the Committee which is dealing with the Restriction of Rents Acts have made recommendations in favour of dealing with this matter under the Restriction of Rents Acts,&apos;Clause 2 (2) givos the 13card of Trade power to extend the provisions of the Profiteering Act to any process of manuf acture or to the repairing,, dyoing, cleaning or cashing of articles.    As instances of high charges not covered by the Profiteering Aot Inits
its present form, there may be cited uoot repairing and laundry work tClause 2 (3) deals with, the definition of profit contained&apos; in the proviso to Section 1 [Z\ of the Profiteering Act and restricts that definition by making the rate of profit tho rato of net profitsMost of the refining provisions of the Bill are designed to. meet difficulties of more or less importance that hare teen oncoTtotored in the working of tho Act and it is . porhaps unnecessary to doal with thorn in detail.    Clause P is designed to afford protection against the victimisation of a person lodging a complaint against a particular trader.It is difficult to estimate very closely the expenses likely to be incurred under the Bill, tut on the basis of past oxperi-ence they are not likely to be heavy.   It must be vWaeiabered, however, that it may be necessary for the Board of Trade to. , undertake prosecutions against large concerns.   In such case the board expenses may be considerably increased.It is proposed that the Profiteering Act aS amended &quot;by this Bill should remain In foroo until 81st December.,. 1920.K.S.E3EBIB.14th April, 1920.
