(A.J. 120).This Report was considered by the Conference of Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Office, London, on Thursday.

*  (b) that Lord Ourzon, as Chairman of tho Conference, should bo asked to represent to the Council of the League of Nations at tho meeting to be held, towards the end of tho first week in April, the desirability of maintaining a small Inter-allied force of all arms in the town of Batumi for the safta of.the moral effect it would have, to main-tain order, and to ensure &quot;the free transit of oil and complete freedom of trafficsThe Conference took note that Colonel Chardigny accepted the proposed boundaries of the now State of Armenia as suggested by the Armenian Commission, and provisionally approved by the Conference at their meeting the previous&quot; day.Up to the present these clauses have been withheld from the Drafting Committee owing to tho large number of provisos to the decision, but as the London meetings of the Supreme Council are now coming to an end it has been thought advisable to communicate the decisions as they stand in order that the Drafting Committee may prepare the necessary articles as regards the boundaries of Armenia, on the assumption that these decisions will not be upset *For the assistance of the Drafting Committee I enclose extracts from the British Secretary&apos;s Notes of the Meetings of March 25th. nnd March 26 th-I have the honour to beSir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)M.P.A.

&amp;   A.J. 120*This report has been agreed upon by the Italian and British representatives on the Armenian Commission.    Owing to pressure of other work end the necossity for an early meeting, it has not been possible to consult the French and Japanese representatives *March 84th 1920i
The Commission appointed to report on the formationof the future Armenian State have the honour to submit the annexed draft clauses for inclusion in the Turkish Treaty,These Articles are based on-the Commission^ first report as already submitted to the Council, but may have to be altered for the reasons and to tho extent explained below.One point of capital i2nportance has moreover necess-arily been omitted, i,e,, the extent of the responsibility that might be assumed^ or the assistance given, by the League of Nations,- On March 12th, the Supreme Council telegraphed an enquiry in this sense to the League then meeting in Paris, On March 16th, the Secretary of the League explained that a special sitting of the League would be necessary for tliis purpose, and that he proposed to convoke one for the 6th April,     Meanwhile the League would, before coming to a decision, require more precise information of the Armenian desiderata.     These specifications have already been obtained from the Armenian Delegation and forwarded to the Secretary General of the League,     In view, therefore, of the capital importance of securing, if possible, the co-opera.tion of the League of Nations, the Armenian chapter of the Treaty cannot be completed until the League has had time to pronounce,Meanwhile, circumstances have arisen which make it necessary for the Commission to suggest the possibility of reconsidering their first report on several points.The/
The first point is the proposed creation of the Free State of Batoum,    The Commission were unanimous that this area should be as restricted as possible,     When, therefore,*   General Milne recommended a limit/50 kilometres wideby 20 deep, the Commission were prepared to accept.it asthe basis to be worked upon by the eventual Inter-AlliedDelimitation Commission^     This acceptance was due to three considerations,(1)   The necessity for a defensible frontier:(2)   The desire to limit commitments especially if Allied troops were to be retained at Batoum for any length of time:(3)   The feeling that a small area was essential if the League of Nations was to be induced to accept the responsibility^The probability has now to be faced that the Leagueof Nations will not in any case assume this task.     If,therefore, as is probable, it is not intended indefinitelyto maintain the Allied garrison now at Batoum, it wouldappear that the solution of the Free State must be abandoned.This entails a recasting of the recommendations of theCommission.While &quot;the impossibility of a free state would be in some respects regrettable, there are also advantages in the altered plan now submitted.     It had been considered necessary to give to Armenia direct contact with the Free State, and this - especially on the adoption of General Milne&apos;s line - involved throwing into Armenia more of Batoum province than would be compatible with future harmony between Armenia and Georgia, on which their respective existences must largely depend.&apos;It is now suggested that only the Chorok Valley and that of the Imer Kheri should be allotted to Armenia as a corridor to the sea.     There should be a free port (not a
free state) at Batc-urn, but tho town, and all the province except the Chorok Valley, would go to Georgia, under express conditions that would ensure freedom of transit both to Armenia and Azerbaijan,    There are signs that the local population are almost as hostile to Georgia as to Armenia, but it would be impossible to constitute a separate entity here except under the League of Nations, and Batoum would more naturally fall to Georgia than to any other claimant.This solution would render amicable relations - and eventually federation - possible between Armenia and Georgia, for it would compensate Georgia for not obtain-ing the Chorok Valley and Lazistan, both of which they claim.The first report of the Commission had provided for an autonomous state of Lazistan under the nominal suzerainty of Armenia.     This provision may now be dropped., and Armenia might be thus reconciled to losing the por-tion of the Batoum province which she had hoped to obtain. There would be ample justification for this.     The Lazes are in no sense a national unit or community and the creation of Laz autonomy may well create what has never existed hitherto, viz: a &quot;Lazistan question&quot;.    Moreover, the pressure of Moslem Turkey eastwards along the sea-board toward Batoum would be encouraged.     The Lazes have no greater claim to autonomy than the other Minord-ties in the new Armenia, and, like these Minorities, their, rights and interests can be adequately safeguarded by the Minorities Treaty which Armenia will have to sign beforeshe/
&amp;Yie takes over her new territory *One point only is left uncovered by these new pro-posals, viz: the communications between Erivan and Batoum by the Kars^Ardahan road.     This road was, under the first report of tho Commission to have fallen to-Armenia as far as the frontier of the Batoum Free State, As shown already, this involves giving too much of Batoum province to Armenia,     Under the new proposals this road will be in Georgian territory between Ardahan and Batoum,     Communications can, however, be assured to Armenia under the article guaranteeing her access to Batoum*     Moreover, if the Inner Khori Valley be included the construction- of a road from Ardahan to the Chorok Valley appears not impossible.ARMENIA/
