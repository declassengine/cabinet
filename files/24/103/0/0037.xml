At present the ice on coast near Terijoki shews no sign of moving.K.k.S. CATSEA1Y.The examination of the wreck of this vessel has been delayed owing to heavy weather.     Naval Attache, Copenhagen wires, that future salvage work will be expensive.   He has therefore been instructed to forward estimate but not to enter into any definite contract with salvage companies *Peace Progress.,    The Warsaw Peace Conference continues.   The Polish Governments policy Is stated to be that anything In the nature of an armistice with Bolsheviks is to be avoided &quot;and onlyncon-clusion of a rapid peace contemplated.   Negotiations with Soviet will open on April 10.     Finnish Government have stated that negotiations with Soviet for an armistice on April 10th are proceeding.Lettish peace delegates will leave for Moscow aboutApril 8th,Lithuania has also informed Soviet that they are prepared to conclude peace with tin em on basis of full recognition and adherence to   ethnographical frontier.EsthoniaThe economical situation   remains critical owing to the immediate adverse effects of tho peace with the Bolsheviks, theprincipal/
- 2 -principal ones being      la Enormous increase in cost of living owing to Jews buying up all food stuffs oriO selling at a large price to Bolsheviks. 2. Lack of fuel and materials &quot;v.rich has&quot; brought about considerable unemployment amongst the deuobilisef1. soldiers.The harsh treatment of the remnants of Yudonitch&apos;s army by the Government reflects this state of affairs, and,, poll 11-cally, tends to causa an orientation towards the extreme Inft.We must, from a Naval point of view, appreciate this new attitude should the question arise of using Estbonian portsfor demonstration purposes against tire Bolshevik fleet.     There is every reason to believe that esthonia will rigidly enforce the secret clauses of her peace treaty with Soviet Hussia in denying herports to foreign warships a     Herman Zaltz is reported to be the&quot;&quot;new Chief of Staff of the Esthonian/f orc e s.Ifeva 1The Lsthonian Government have approached H.h. Government with regard to their de jure1 - recognition.Trade.Krassin, head of the Bolshevik trade delegates to the United kingdom, has arrived in Stockholm,   tome of the members of his committee remained behind.   The difficulties with Finland over free passage in Finnish territory were overcome satisfactorily on the Soviet Government agreeing that the solution of the Petohenga controversy would not be in any way prejudiced.     If Soviet Government intend sending the remainder of the original delegation, H.M. Minister at Ilelsingfors strongly deprecates passage across Finland and urges that Esthonia route be used. Krassin is reported to have definitely stated that the trade dele-gation represents the Soviet Government, as the Co-operative Societies are entirely under Government jurisdiction.   Krassin leaves for Copenhagen to confer with hitvinoff on April 6th.   The Bolsheviks state that delegation is not to proceed lo England without Litvinoff.      Mr. the and five members of the Economic Council left on April 5th for Copenhagen to meet the Bolshevik delegates.Finland.The political situation is reported, to be critical. The majority of the new Government with the exception of M. Hoisti, (Progressive) and M. Lavonius, (Progressive), belong to the pro-German parties of the Right.   These parties are in close touch with General Mannerheim, who is reported to have gone over to the pro-German side during the last few months and is now decidedly anti-British.The late Government which was really a Coalition, fell owing to being forced to the left over the peace-with-Russia question and the amnesty to the Red Finns, thus alienating the Right and Centre.   The political situation demands attention from the Admiralty point of view, as the question of naval bases, should the Bolshevik fleet become aggressive in the spring and summer of this year, will   be seriously affected.   The general trend either to the Right (pro-German) or to the Left, (pro-Bolshevik) is distinctly hostile to British interests, although the desire for commercial facilities with the United Kingdom will have a balancing tendency.Sweden.H.ivi. the King of Sweden or eposes leaving Sweden on April 7th to spend Dome weeks in the South of France.

Chicherin has been informed that the quickest method of relieving the iue-breaker would be to acquiro the coal on board the s.s. &quot;KILDIIm&quot; lying at a Norwegian port and to send out one of the icebreakers in Soviet hands, such as the &quot;POJARSKI&quot; or &quot;CAN/eA&quot;, the Bolsheviks having reported in their ft/T that they captured 4,500 tons of coal at the fall of Archangel.   It is reported that several officers of the late   Russian army of Northern Government who surrendered to the Bolsheviks on the evacuation by General Miller of -Archangel are to be tried for their lives by a Soviet Tribunal.   II.M* Govern-ment points out to Soviet Government that.this is in direct viola-tlon of the terms of Soviet amnesty offered to these men and hope that the report is incorrect.The refugees from MURMANSK and ARCHaNGEL are reported to be in   camp at TrondjhCn, Norway, and at Lahti, Finland.   They are being well treated at the former place, but complaint is made to H.k. Government that at the latter place the sanitary conditions are very bad and that,the Finnish Government treat refugees as int erne d pr i s oner s .Generals Miller and Skobelstein, late of the Northern army, are reported to- be tainted with Bolshevism *Russan. internal jconditions *       *Corroborative reports continue to be received shewing clearly that the Soviet Government is faced with complete break-down of all economic machinery clue to war exhaustion and. lack of - transport. The apathy of the general public continues to grow more marked, the only sentiment shenn being a desire for peace and utter boredom with Red and White alike.MEDITERRANEAN AMD BLACK SEA.11* 11 * Government decided, in view of the AmeclTrade Policy with Russia and&apos;the defeat of Denikinls forces who only hold the Crimea,,the holding of which is problematical owing to the possibility of the inhabitants turning over to the Bolsheviks, that General Denikin was to be advised to make terms with the Bolsheviks at once, and that if he refused to do so no further support o^ assistance in any shape or form should be given him*   On the other hand H.k. Government would be prepared to assist in the nego-tiations and to afford him and his chief supporters hospit-ality in this country *The Admiralty, in accordance with this policy, instructed the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean that no assistance was to be given by K.M. ships to Denikin to enable him to prolong the struggle * The Commander-in-Chief was also instructed to take tho necessary steps tp prevent any Russian warships falling into Bolshevik hands should Sevastopol fall.Novorossisk was captured by Bolsheviks on the morning of 27th inarch. 0ri the evening of fcarch 26th fighting was proceeding .in outskirts,   at this tire, under cover of fire from British and French Ships, the embarkation of 2nd Royal SGots and the Iviission in s.s. &quot;EAROVER&quot; was completed without casualties.     Later that night &quot;HANOVER&quot; left for Theodosia to land a portion of the Mission for the Crimea and then to proceed to Constantinople.General/

Army was got away by road. forGeneral Denikin left/Theodosia in a Russian destroyer.The \.ar Council at Sevastopol on 4th April accepted Denikinfs resignation after Grange1 had pointed out the uselessness of further prolonging the struggle.   Mangel was appointed in Denikin&apos;s place, and he has been instructed to make best terms possible   with the Bolsheviks through the Allies.     Denikin and his Chief of Staff are on their way to Constantinople on boardlt Vi   o      &quot; c;rp&quot;&apos; a tyq :. cmll ri *XA * 1j .

Commander-in-Chief reports that it is hoped to remove these also to the Crimea.   The Crimea is reported quiet but dangerously short of food.About 30,000 of Kuban army are at Tuapse and a portion of the Don army with 12 pounders are endeavouring to make Tuapse over the hills .   The Bolsheviks are at Maikop and advancing towards Tuapse.   It,is stated that they intend marching by the coast road to Batoum.Azerbaijan.Due to the collapse of the Volunteer Forces, Azer-baijan asks for a definition of Allied policy in the event of aggression by the Bolsheviks, which they state from reliable information to be intended.   If a promise of moral support is not forthcoming Azerbaijan will most probably attempt to come to terms with Bolsheviks *Georgia oifGeorgian Government state thet/they attempt to with-draw troops from Batoum province it will mean the fall of the Government?   Georgia evidently wishes to occupy Batoum as well as Poti in order to strangle other Caucasian States:.   General Milne suggests that H.Iu. Government should send an ultimatum to the Georgian Government demanding immediate withdrawal from the Batoum Province.Caspian *Mr. Wardop wires that Petrovsg has been abandoned. Six ships are now at Enzeli, but weather prevents communication with them.   Admiral Sergieff says that he is willing to hand over control/to   the British but not to Persia or Azerbaijan.

ADMIRALTY, S.W.I. 8th April, 1920.SIBERIA.Czechs should he clear of Chita in a fortnight and all concentrated at Vladivostock by 2nd May.   The latter place is already becoming congested due to delay of American ships. German P/W are being repatriated in Japanese bottoms and the &quot;SCOTLAND MRU&quot; sailed on harch 31st for Hamburg with 22 Austrians and 1,018 Germans.Voltscheovski1s troops are rapidly disintegrating, due to desertions.There are reports, of encounters between Japanese and local troops due to tho strained relations between Japanese and Russians.   Japanese state that they will allow no one to penetrate into zone controlled by them, but will maintain attitude of non-interference so long as their troops are not attacked.Two Commissars, Vilexiski and Yansen, have arrived at ? Irkutsk and Vladivostock respectively, apparently invested with authority from Moscow to negotiate with China, America and Japan.The &quot;YAKUT&quot; and &quot;OREL&quot; arrived at Hong Kong on March 26th and the &quot;OREL&quot; sailed for Singapore on April 2nd*H.K.S. &quot;CARLISLE&quot; sailed from Vladivcstock for Nagasaki on April 1st.ITALY.It is stated that Admiral Andrews, with the  U.S.A. cruiser &quot;PITTSBURGH&quot; and four destroyers, has been ordered to remain in the Adriatic, using Spalato and Venice as his bases. It had been expected that this Squadron was to be withdrawn.g I U M E.An Englishman who has lately been&apos; in Plume states that the remaining so-called loyal crew of the &apos;DantoJ (Dread-nought) is not paid by d&apos;Annunzio, but by the Italian Government. This crew includes the Admiral and his staff.   The admiral, although 1 loyal&apos;, frequently has tea with d&apos;Annunzio*Commander Rizzo, the great naval hero,, and d&apos;Annunzio&apos;s right hand man, is now in Rome, and on being asked if he would return to Plume, said &quot;He hoped he would never see that pcrcrb again&apos;&apos;.&apos;A report dated 14.3.20 states that d&apos;Annunzio     has about 10,000 troops at his disposal. Senior officers are very fewo   A crisis is undoubtedly, fast approaching. The Blockade instituted by the Italian Government is making itself felt, and the town will soon be reduced to extremity.   The inhabitants are very tired of a situation which is the economic ruin of a once flourishing port.Even&apos;if Flume were annexed to ftaly the majority of the inhabitants believe the former prosperity will never return. Both railways from Fiume run through Jugo-Slavia, pnd they fear the latter will construct a new port further south and put on prohibitive tariffs.D&apos;Annunzio is believed to have been in communication with the Bolshevist leaders, and says he has arranged for an out-break in the Balkans if force is used to turn him out.   His remarks as to dying before surrendering may not be all bluff, but any threat from the sea would endanger his position with the towns-people.The Italian Government is trying to keep its word, and its blockade is, in fact, succeeding.   But the Italian Military Party is, at least, sympathotdrJfcowards d^Vnnunzio, and to the East of Fiume the blockading Government troops and d^nnunzio^ troops are so disposed as to form a 1st and 2nd line respectively against Jugo-Slav attack.MISCELLANEOUS HOME INTELLIGENCE.Shipbuilding at Barrow.A sister ship to the &quot;SCYTHIA&quot; has been laid down at Vickers1 Yard.   Several other Cunarders are expuCted&apos;&quot;to be laid down in the near future.
