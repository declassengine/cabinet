Military Secret.1356From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,9th April 1920.(Received .10th.)4473. Part I.-(I) Malleson telegraphed 3rd April, repeating Tehran, that agents had reported following Bolshevik garrisons on Merv-Kush line on 17th March : Takhta Bazaar, 3,000 men, 1-1 guns. Tashkcpri, 4,000 men. Yulatan?, 1,000 men. Kushk, to which access was impossible, was locally said to have garrison of 1,000, with two aeroplanes and many guns.(2) On. 6th April he telegraphed report of agent from Merv, dated 27th March, according to which there were 13,000 troops between Merv and Kushk, and 8,000 from west of Merv to Askabad.(3) On 4th April garrison of Askabad was 2,000 men with three aeroplanes and three armoured cars and three batteries.(4) Malleson considered concentration on. Kushk line w^as due to fear of Afghan designs, while Bolshevik preparations on North-East Frontier of Khorasan appeared to be purely defensive, as no collection of transport or abnormal numbers are reported there.(5) On 27th March there were 700 camels and 50 (corrupt group) guns in Merv. Collection of more transport was proceeding, probably to supplement railway to part II. (6) Kerki, 13th March. The garrison now numbers 2,200. There are, as usual, twro theories with regard to this influx of troops. One is that it is feared that Afghans intend to seize territory along Oxus frontier, and that these troops are intended to guard against Afghan aggression. The other theory is that these troops are to support their Afghan Allies in the approaching renewal of war between England and Afghanistan. The first theory is the one generally held, and agents remark on significance of fact that the local Bolshevik authorities regard the Afghans with suspicion, whilst Afghans on their side comment bitterly on the fact that the Bolsheviks have failed to make territorial restorations which were promised last year.As a sign of strained relations, it is further to be noted that Afghan merchants have now stopped coming through.Part III.-- (7) Along frontier, between Termez and Kerki, minor Bolshevik posts are being strengthened and regular patrols are sent out.(8) At date of report the telegraph line from Karshi to Kerki was within about 8 miles of Kerki. The railway from Karshi now runs as far as Nowidi, which is two stations from Kerki.(9) Amicable relations exist between Bolsheviks and local Bokharan officials. Local Bokharan (? peasants) have a preference for dealing in new Bolshevik paper money.   Supplies are plentiful and relatively cheap.Kushk.
