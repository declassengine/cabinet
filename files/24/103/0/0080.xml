(P 2934) From Viceroy, ttth April 1920.(Received 14th.)42G S. Afghanistan. Malleson has sent us precis of speech delivered by Amir at Kabul February last, of which printed copies are being circulated in Afghanistan :--&quot;The present state (? of the) Mahoinedan world is distressing. May God avert ruin. Empire of Turkey in a critical state. End of Khalifat desired by. European Powers. The friendship of Afghanistan desired by England, but that is impossible so long as England&quot; seeks Turkey&apos;s destruction. That Indian Mahomedans are taking-firm stand for Turkey is an occasion for joy. Shankat Ali and (group omitted) Ali say unless Khalifat is settled according to Mahomed an wishes then Jehad or migration is only alternative. In this matter Hindus also associate themselves. They, too, are willing to migrate. All such will be welcomed by Afghanistan. The Afghan nation cannot tolerate settlement of Khalifat question by infidel Powers. If the Afghan nation and the whole of the Mahomeclan world hesitate at this crisis to (corrupt group) their lives for faith, then Islam is dead. Put that cannot happen. &apos; I am ready to sacrifice my life ; let all Afghans be likewise ready.&quot;I ought to express hope that Obedulla will refrain from wounding the feelings of Islams. !Malleson adds circular Has caused no excitement in Western Afghanistan. An Indian returned from Kabul adds ihat speech was delivered on anniversary of murder of late Amir, i.e., 20th-21st February ; that printed copies were posted in all public places in Kabul and caused belief that Amir would proclaim Jehad.
