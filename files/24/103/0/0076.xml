I note with the greatest misgiving the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. 1064 that the price of sugar should immediately be raised by 3d per pound02,   I understood that it was agreed by the Cabinet Committee on the decontrol of food that the increase in the price of sugar by 2d per lb. at that time oontemplatod and sinco carried into effect should be compensated at the time of the Budget Statement by an-announcement from the Chancellor,of a very considerable, reduction in the duty.3,   I feel very strongly that   the duty should be so reduced as to enable the price of sugar for the domestic ration to be kept at l/- per lb94*   In this connection I would draw the attention of the Cabinet to the fact that the price of sugar has quite recently been increased from 8d to lOd per lb., and that the price of broad and flour was Increased on the 12th inst.As a result of these increases and   of the contemplated further increase in the price of sugar to l/^. per lb. the food index figure for May 1st may be estimated at 148 as against 133.2 for March Iste These figures take into aooount anticipated seasonal decreases during tho period March 1st to April 30th In the price of dairy products*5* Every penny added to the price of sugar adds, on the scale adopted In official calculations, about 2*5 points to the food index figure.Ministry of Pood, CHARLES A, McCURDY?14th April 1920.
