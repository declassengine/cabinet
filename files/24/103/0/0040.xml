General.The Court of Inquiry concerning Dock Labour.The report of the Court of Inquiry^ into the conditions of. employment of dock and waterside labour, which was issued on the 31st March, is a document of much importance. This Court of Inquiry was set up under Part II of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, which provides that where a dispute exists or is apprehended the Minister may appoint a Court of Inquiry to report on the matters at issue. A report of a Court of Inquiry is not an award of a tribunal which the parties have morally bound themselves to observe, but consists of an impartial statement of the merits of the particular dispute with recommendations as to its settlement which are put by the Minister to the parties for their consideration. It may be noted that the report was signed by the chairman and all the members with the exception of Sir Joseph Broodbank and Mr. Frederick Scrutton, though Mr John Smethurst makes certain vital reservations. The remarks of the Court in so far as they affect dock labour as such, and the contribution which they make to the solution of the problems specifically connected with dock labour, are referred to in Part II of this Report, in connection with the Registration Schemes of the Ministry of Labour. In addition, however, much of the Report has a general interest in so far as the problems dealt with* The Court consisted of the Rt. Hon. Lord Shaw of Dunfermline (chairman), Sir Joseph .0. Broodbank, Sir Lionel Fletcher, and Frederick Scrutton, Esq., all of the National Council of Port Labour Employers, Harry Gosling, Esq., C.H., Ben Tillett, Esq., M.P., and Robert Williams, Esq., all of the National Transport &quot;Workers&apos; Federation, A. Pugh, Esq., Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, and John Smethurst, Esq., Federation of Master Cotton Spinners.(01981)  150 4/20  h&amp;s Y
are largely to be met with over the whole field of industry. It is to this aspect of the Report that it is proposed to call attention here.The Court begins by pointing out that the true and substantial case presented by the dockers, was based upon a broad appeal for a better standard of living; &quot; By this is not meant a right to have merely a subsistence allowance, in the sense of keeping the soul and the body of the worker together, but a right to have life ordered upon a higher standard, with full regard to those comforts and decencies which are promotive of better habits, which give a chance for the development of a greater sense of self respect, and which betoken a higher regard for the place occupied by these workers in the scheme of citizenship.&quot; The Court approves of this view, and states its opinion that the time has gone past for assessing the value of human labour at the poverty line. The Court recom-mends the establishment of a national minimum of 16s. per day on the basis of the National Agreement for the 44-hour week, and it points out that &quot;there does not seem to be for some years what might be called a reasonable expectation of a substantial cheapening of the cost of living.&quot; It, therefore, holds that in these circumstances the question of a sliding scale does not arise. The Court thus adopts the principle that wages should be standardised now at a level which will secure a satisfactory standard of life, even at the present high cost of living, without any stipulation that if and when the present cost of living falls wages shall fall in proportion.In drawing attention to the question of the effect which, this minimum rate for dockers might have on other industries, the Court is careful to point out that at present the docker, who comes under the ordinary denomination of a casual worker, works on an average only eight half-days out of the eleven, and his weekly wage would thus be not  4 8s., but  3 4s. Thus the Court contends that as matters stand in the dock industry, the comparison with other industries fails at the crucial point, namely, that in those industries steady employ-ment prevails, where dock labour is in a very large proportion uncertain labour. This matter, namely, the effect that the wage of 16s. per day may be expected to have on other industries, is dealt with in some detail in the minority report by Sir Joseph Brood-bank and Mr. Scrutton. They point out that under the recent national railway settlement the minimum wages of porters at goods depots are fixed at from 57s. to 61s. a week of 48 hours, and they ask whether the railwaymen who work alnogside dockers on the same class of work, many of them for the same employer, would be content with their present settlement. They also contend that, if the recommendation of the Court were adopted, the dockers&apos; minimum wage would be raised considerably above the level of many grades of skilled workmen, and would inevitably lead to such workmen throughout the country agitating for corresponding increases in their wages. This raises the whole question of the relationship between wages levels in different industries. Even as it is now practically impossible over the major portion of industry to have unrelated wage levels in the same trade in different localities, so it is becoming every day more impossible to have unrelated wage levels in different trades, and to regard the problem of a wage settlement in any particular industry as related to that industry alone. It is, of course, true, as the Court points out, that dockers&apos; employment at present is mainly casual, and, therefore, their actual weekly earnings do not compare so favourably as at first sight appears with those, say, of railwaymen and skilled workers who have the real and great benefits of establish-ment or permanence. But these benefits are not usually assessed at their full value by the men who enjoy them, and they feel aggrieved when workers in another industry, which they had been accustomed to regard as definitely on a lower grade than their own, obtain higher wages than they do.From a wider standpoint the most important parts of the report are not those which deal with the immediate question of wages, but those in which the problems of casual labour and output are surveyed. The Court points out that it became plain as the Inquiry proceeded that the question of the minimum wage could not be dissevered from these two other problems which directly bear upon it.With regard to the evils of the casual system, the Court expresses itself in vigorous terms, and states its opinion that labour frequently or constantly under-employed is injurious to the interests of the workers, the ports and the public, and that it is discreditable to society. &quot; It undermines all security and is apt to undermine all self-respect upon the workers&apos; part. Society,will not tolerate much longer the continuance of the employment of human beings on those lines. Since the war casualisation has reached the dimensions of a serious social disease.&quot;As a remedy for this disease the Court suggests in the case of the dock industry a system of registration for all workers at the docks, and that the daily wage system should be abolished and a system of weekly payment of wages inaugurated; and it records its views in favour of the adoption of the principle of maintenance.   These measures would impart, in
Paet II. Departmental.Port Labour : Registration Schemes.The Report of the Court of Inquiry concerning the wages and conditions of employ-ment of dock labour speaks in emphatic condemnation of the casual nature of dock employ-ment, and places in the forefront of the list of remedies for this evil the registration of port labour. &quot; The beginning of the remedy, and the condition of it, is a system of registration of all workers at the docks.&quot;  The recommendations of the Courts therefore,* The detailed recommendation is as follows:We recommend that a scheme of maintenance should he at once jointly considered and after its effect on the ordinary rates of pay has been estimated, the parties by agreement should fix permanent standard rates of pay.(01981) Y2the view of the Court, steadiness to the industry as a whole, together with great improvement in its conditions. It would become a matter of interest both for the Port and for the employers that all the available labour on the register should be employed so as to avoid a mere deadweight of pay to casuals. With regard to the workmen themselves, admission to and retention on the register would become an object of just effort; and it would equally be an object of effort on their part when once on the register to adapt themselves to the requirements of the Port and rise from the maintenance list on to the list of full employ -ment. The minority report also recommends51&apos; that a scheme of maintenance should be jointly considered. These recommendations are of great significance in view of the demand which is being extensively made by Labour that the maintenance of the unemployed should be a charge upon the particular industries to which they belong.In connection with the problem of output, the Court is of opinion that various causes, in addition to the reduction of hours to 44 per week, have contributed towards it, and draws attention to the responsibility of Government departments for congestion at the Ports. The Court also draws attention to the responsibility for loss of output which is shared by port authorities and employers, and notes in particular the absence of confidence between employers and employees derived in the main from the men&apos;s memory of conditions which existed in the past, whose evil effects still undermine their confidence in the employers. The Court then deals in some detail with the responsibilities of the men themselves. It points out that apart from isolated cases of breach of contract, there are breaches of contract of wide and general scope, one, failure to give the contract time, the other, a deliberate slowing down of work. Both of these types of breach of contract are extremely serious, and they have an effect, which the outside public fails to realise, of lessening the output of work to such an extent as, in the opinion of the Court, to increase materially the charges upon industry and the prices of supplies to the people. In the opinion of the Court it has been established that the 8-hour day, agreed upon in settlements based upon the National Eecommendation of the 7th March, 1919, has been improperly, and in violation of the bargain, reduced by one hour, owing to the chiselling off, so to speak, of fractions of time at the beginning and end of each half-day. The Court also points out that there is now, arising not from exceptional causes, but as part of a deliberate policy, the adoption in not a few cases of a system of slowing down of output. The Court strongly condemns &quot; ca&apos; canny &quot; which, it suggests, means that time is adulterated just as in the case of a merchant who would make up weight by moistening his sugar or mixing it with sand.In order to increase output, the Court has certain remedies to suggest. It is of opinion that the labour situation might be ameliorated and loss of output might be avoided if direct representation were secured for labour on the governing bodies in all the ports of the kingdom. It also recommends that a Joint Standing Industrial Council with district councils and works committees should immediately be formed for this industry, and it suggests that this Council would be the proper body, failing private agreement between the parties, for reaching a decision upon other matters connected with the conditions of employment of dock labourers, which were originally referred to this Court. The Court also suggests that consideration should be given to the extension of the system of payment by results where practicable and desirable in this industry, and it is also of opinion that the introduction of labour-saving machinery would contribute to the increase of output. A notable feature also of the Courfs treatment of the difficult problem of output is its reiterated appeal to the honour of the men. It insists that such breaches of contract as failure to give contract time and deliberate restriction of output are dishonourable, and it expresses a confidence which has not been echoed in all quarters that an appeal to the honour of the men will not fail.
should do much to strengthen the hands of the Ministry of Labour, which, since the armistice, has been pressing steadily, and not without success, for the general adoption of such a system. The work which has been accomplished has depended entirely upon the attainment of agreement on the subject between employers and employed. Discussion has been carried on through the Port Labour Committees, composed of representatives of employers and workpeople in equal proportions, and even after agreement on a scheme of registration has been secured by the Port Labour Committee, its application in practice has depended upon the voluntary support of the workpeople and the employers of the port, for the Port Labour Committees have no statutory authority. Under these conditions progress has perhaps been slower than was desirable,-but has nevertheless been substantial. Over twenty ports have accepted registration schemes and have either put them into operation or are on the point of doing so.*The latest and the most important success with which the Ministry has met is the acceptance, for the Port of London, of a scheme of registration on the lines of that recom-mended by the Committee under Mr. Justice Roche, to which the Court of Inquiry make reference. The negotiations necessary to secure the adoption of this scheme have been prolonged. Mr. Justice Roche&apos;s Committee advised the adoption of a system of registration at the close of August, 1919, but recommended that before attempting to form a general register of dock labour, a register of employers should first be formed in order to ascertain what measure of agreement on the subject existed in the Port. Negotiations with the London Port Labour Committee showed that there was a substantial agreement between both the employers and the workpeople that some system of registration was necessary, but that there was some division of opinion as to the representation of the Ministry on the committee to be entrusted with the arrangement of the scheme. Accord-ingly a special joint committee, known as the Port of London Registration Committee, was formed, the Ministry being represented only by one of the joint secretaries. It was eventually possible to show an ample measure of agreement among the employers, and the committee found themselves in a position to submit a registration scheme which follows closely on the lines of that recommended by Mr. Justice Roche&apos;s Committee. The scheme provides for the issue, by the Registration Committee, of a metal, tally to every recognised docker in the port, and preference for employment will be given to tally holders. The rules agreed upon provide that tally holders will be expected to follow their employment regularly, and that, on revision of the register from time to time, the , names of those considered not to have fulfilled this obligation will be removed. Thus, almost simul-taneously with the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry, agreement has been reached in the Port of London on a question which has been under discussion for many years. It is expected that the scheme will come into operation early in June.The general experience of the Ministry in connection with this step towards decasual-isation will serve to illustrate some of the difficulties which are likely to obstruct the work which the Court of Inquiry recommend. Objections to registration have been made from time to time by both sides. At Glasgow, for example, prolonged efforts to introduce a registration scheme broke down before the opposition of the men, although the scheme was recommended to them by the executive of their union, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers, and was supported in principle by the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation. A mass meeting, early in November, 1919, proved hostile to the scheme from the beginning, apparently on the ground that it involved undue interference and that it might lead to the payment of wages weekly. At Goole, on the other hand, it has hitherto been impossible to introduce a scheme on account of the objections of the employers. The union represen-tatives on the Port Labour Committee submitted a scheme based upon the model scheme circulated by the Ministry, but the employers appear to have been alarmed by a speech alleged to have been made by the secretary of the union to the effect that, under any scheme which might be suggested, he would close the port to all labour except union men. Modifications of the scheme proposed failed to meet the objections of the employers, who eventually refused to discuss the matter further with the workpeople.Even where a scheme has been introduced by agreement, it has proved on occasion difficult to maintain the atmosphere of goodwill required for its operation. At Grimsby, for example, which was one of the earliest ports to adopt the registration scheme, difficulties arose in July, 1919, with the local union, which was one of three represented on the Port Labour Committee. This union decided to abandon the registration scheme, ostensibly on the ground that it had failed to achieve decasualisation. Union rivalries and some discontent over the administration of the out-of-work donation scheme seem, however, to have played a large part in the decision.  The difficulty proved sufficiently serious to* Some schemes include the use of surplus stands or other special offices in the docks for the better distribution of labour.
Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.*Miners.The progress of the negotiations arising out of the wages demand of the Miners&apos; Federa-tion of Great Britain is noticed in all papers, but with two exceptions, it cannot be said that the miners receive very enthusiastic support. The &quot; Nation &quot; and the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; however (27th ult.), were under the impression that the Government was pursuing a policy of deliberate provocation, and in this connection the &quot; Nation &quot; repeated the idealistic theory of the M.F.G.B. policy propounded by Mr. Hodges at the Trades Union Congress. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; drew a parallel between the negotiations with the miners and the railway strike of last autumn and hinted that the Government, for political purposes, was desirous of a stride. It is interesting to note that this paper unreservedly condemned the attitude of. the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, and adopted the view that the South Wales demand resulted from the deliberate policy of the extremists to secure the eventual bankruptcy of the mining industry. The events of the succeeding week showed that these alarms were somewhat previous, but the &quot; New Statesman &quot; (3rd inst.) kept to its opinion of Government policy. &quot;Wiser counsels have prevailed with the Government and the hot heads who desired to provoke a stoppage by refusing concessions have suffered defeat.&quot; The &quot; New Age &quot; (25th inst.) maintained its critical attitude and concluded that the miners had achieved a position of maximum unpopularity and maximum disadvantage.Trade Union Movement.The notable feature in the Labour and Socialist Press for the week ending 27th ult., was a concentration upon matters of Trade Union organisation. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; (13th ult.) announced a series of articles on the subject of Trade Union machinery, but the first of these articles was entirely devoted to a description of the legal position of Trade Unions and a complaint of the jurisdiction exercised over the internal economy of Trade Unions by the Registrar of Friendly Societies. In its issue of the 27th, however, this paper dealt in various articles with the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation, the Boilermakers&apos; Society, and the National Sailors&apos;and Firemen&apos;s Union. The South Wales correspondent of this paper dealt with the machinery by which the rank and file might control the S.W.M.F. He stated that the South Wales Socialist Society, when originally formed, was intended to unify the rank and file movement, and to gain control over the S.W.M.F. machinery. This attempt hitherto had failed owing to the fact that the district delegates proceeded to South Wales Miners&apos; Conferences without having had previous unofficial consultation, and thus the S.W.M.F. Executive were able to play off one district against another and to determine the decisions of the conference. It was stated that a new rank and file organisation was being formed and this correspondent of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; gave details of the scheme which he favoured. The organisation would be confined entirely to miners, and its purpose would be to determine the tactics to be pursued in order to precipitate a revolution and the methods to be adopted for the running of the mines if and when the revolution occurred. It would be based upon local branches, geographical in character, who would elect representatives to District Committees. These District Committees would each send one member to a small Central Committee, the purpose of which would be to co-ordinate the policies of the various District Committees, and* This Part deals with the papers for the fortnight ending April 3rd.necessitate the withdrawal of the registration scheme then in force, and continuous negotia-tions since August of last year have even now only just produced the acceptance of a reconstituted committee and a prospect of agreement among the unions on a new registra-tion scheme. Difficulties of a less serious kind have occurred in one or two of the other ports which have accepted registration schemes. The causes are generally, as at Aberdeen, the failure of certain employers to give priority of employment to registered workers, or, as at Dundee, the withdrawal of one party or the other in this case one of the employers&apos; associations from the scheme to which they had previously adhered. At Kings Lynn trouble has arisen through a difference of opinion as to the right of certain individuals to registration. The thorny problem of timekeeping has also given rise on occasion to some difficulties. It is plain, therefore, that the introduction throughout the country of universal registration in ports, docks and harbours, as recommended by the Court of Inquiry, will not prove a simple task, if purely voluntary methods are to be adopted. But the Ministry of Labour have already broken the ground, and their work is not without promise of ultimate success.
apparently to act as an official opposition to the S.W.M.F. Executive in South Wales Miners&apos; conferences. It was recognised that, though in normal times and for normal business this rank and file organisation would be conducted on fully democratic lines, yet in times of crisis the small Central Committee must lead and must be in a position to act on its own initiative. The scheme of organisation would also provide in a limited degree for extension to other industries and to other parts of the country.The second article on this subject in this paper was on the Boilermakers&apos; Society, in which Mr. H. Pollitt complained of the autocracy of the Executive Committee of this Union. He pointed out that the Executive Committee was in absolute control of all finance and therefore of all disputes, that there was no machinery in the constitution of the Union to provide for a general conference to formulate policy, and that the journal of the Society was so controlled that no criticism of the Executive Committee could appear in it. Mr. Pollitt recommended that local rank and file vigilance committees should be formed to supervise and criticise the working of the official machinery of the Union. The value of these criticisms is lessened by the fact, that Mr. Pollitt&apos;s knowledge of the rules of the society is obviously inadequate.The third article was on the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union and did not contain any constructive suggestions, but confined itself to a criticism of the limited objects of the Union as outlined in the rules, and of the practical permanence of the Union&apos;s President and General Secretary, and to a personal attack upon Mr. Havelock Wilson.Two articles in the &quot; Railway Review &quot; (26th inst.) on the machinery of the N.U.R. may also be noted in this connection. A typical leading article warned railwaymen that little progress could result from sectional impatience and stated the policy of the Union as being &quot; massed bargaining in the direction of equation of payment for similar work.&quot; An unofficial correspondent (Mr. G. Yates), recapitulated the current complaint that the machinery of this Union is too cumbersome to allow the governing bodies of the Union to be in proper touch with the rank and file of their members, and propounded a scheme whereby these defects might be remedied. The scheme, briefly, provided for the formation of unofficial grade organisations, based upon local grade meetings, to provide a means whereby the policy of the rank and file of each grade might be impressed upon the official organs of the union.This criticism of Trade Union machinery in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; may, perhaps, be connected with the Trades Union Congress decision against direct action. The complaint that this decision was that of Trade Union executives and officials rather than of Trade Union members is common to all the articles appearing in that paper, but the &quot; Railway Review &quot; article would appear to show that this feeling against the unwieldy and undemocrative of much Trade Union machinery is of a more fundamental character. Unofficial internal organisation may be required in a great industrial Union as a supple-ment to the official representative machinery, if these unions are to be properly conducted according to the wishes of their members.A feature of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; for some time past has been a series of notes by a trade union correspondent, who describes himself as &quot; Jack Cade.&quot; In the issue of this paper for the 25th ult., he makes some desultory remarks upon trade union policy and suggests that trade unions should endeavour to make their strikes serve a somewhat wider and nobler purpose than mere wage increases. He makes two specific proposals, the first that an attempt should be made in each case to widen the area of the dispute, &quot; so that not one craft nor one shop, but the whole of the works from labourer to foreman and clerk is swung into the demand &quot; ; the second proposal is that, to the demand for wages, there should be added a demand for control together with a claim for the remedying of all out-standing grievances, &quot; control should include the right to shop committees, and the right to elect foremen and supervisors.&quot; The ideas of this writer would seem to be very similar to those of the trade union critics of the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; and &quot; The Call.&quot; In the last issue of this report,* his remarks on Joint Industrial Councils were noted. It may be observed that the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; (26th inst.) criticises these remarks as being based upon incomplete observations. It is claimed in this latter paper, that the National Wool (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council has proved itself to be a very useful body, and it is urged that the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; correspondent^ remarks on the limitations of trade union leaders were unjust and untrue.The Labour Movement.The imminence of the annual conference of the Independent Labour Party, when the papers reviewed this week went to press, robs the discussion on the merits of this party and, especially, on the question of its international affiliations, of much of its value.   The* 24th ult., page 158.
&quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; (3rd inst.) attacks the I.L.P. and Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, while Mr. Macdonald outlines in the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (1st inst.), for the benefit of an anonymous &quot; young member &quot; of the I.L.P., the principles which should guide the policy of the party. In this latter article, the most notable point is Mr. Macdonald&apos;s insistence upon the fact that the I.L.P. proposes to bring about the social revolution by changing opinion. Mr. George Lansbury&apos;s return from Russia is the occasion of much comment, none of which is favourable either to Mr. Lansbury or to the &quot; Daily Herald.&quot; Mr. Philip Snowden, in the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; takes this opportunity to formulate a series of criticisms on the Third International, while Mr. P. G. Gorle, in &quot; Justice,&quot; attacks the Labour move-ment in general, and Mr. Lansbury, in particular, for their attitude towards the Soviet Government. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; (3rd inst.), with reference to the Prime Ministers speech, on the 27th tilt:, vigorously denies that the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; is the &quot; official organ of the Labour Party.&quot; . &apos;Nationalisation.An interesting light is thrown upon the problem whether the recent mines nationalisa-tion campaign has succeeded or not in its purpose, by articles in the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; (27th ult.) and the &quot; Clarion,&quot; urging that the M.F.G.B. should concentrate more than ever upon nationalisation propaganda. Mr. Emrys Hughes, in the former paper, corn-plains that the S.W.M.F did not show sufficient enthusiasm in the recent campaign. His particular charge is that the S.W.M.F. refused to organise any Sunday meetings. The report of the Board of Trade Inquiry into Industrial Assurance receives considerable notice, and is made the basis of a demand for the nationalisation of this class of insurance business. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; (27th ult.) devotes an article to outlining a project for the nationalisation of railways.Government Policy.The Army Estimates for the financial year 1920-21 are noticed in the &quot; New States-man &quot; and the &quot; Labour Leader.&quot; The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; devotes a leading article to a criticism of their size, while, on the other hand, the &quot; New Statesman &quot; would appear to be convinced of their moderation. This paper believes that it is a misfortune that the Labour Party has no coherent policy on Imperial and military questions, a belief which is well supported by the character of the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; article.The amendment passed in Committee to the Unemployment Insurance Bill, allowing approved societies under the Health Insurance Acts to administer the Unemployment Insurance scheme receives considerable attention, and is universally condemned. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; believes that this amendment, unless it be deleted on the report stage, will be fatal to the Bill.The final report of Lord Desborough&apos;s Committee on the Police Service is taken by these papers to mean the centralisation of the Police forces. Surprise is expressed that the Labour members of Lord Desborough&apos;s Committee should have signed the report and the results which might follow from the putting of its recommendations into operation are somewhat imaginatively outlined.The &quot; &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; (3rdinst.) is much concerned at an anticipated increase in the rents of working class houses and recommends the formation by women of &quot; street committees &quot; to resist any increases. Such, committees, it appears, are also intended to form an effective part of the machinery of the coming revolution.*Foreign Affairs.The events in Germany are noticed in all papers, but the comments of these papers all sutler from lack of reliable news as to the course of events and as to the real matters at issue. The &quot; New Statesman &quot; concludes that the history of the coup d&apos;etat shows that a general strike, when used for the defence of democracy, is the most powerful weapon yet devised. This is the only general comment upon the general strike which appears. Mr. Philip Snowden, in trie &quot; Labour Leader &quot; (1st inst.), returns to the question of increased output and insists upon the fact that increased production is an immediate necessity if Central Europe is to be saved from starvation. He thinks that in this crisis academic discussions on theories of production are out of place. He acknowledges that increased output may benefit the capitalist, but &quot; the only way to save Europe is by bringing food and raw materials and machinery to the famine countries.&quot;
Part IV.-General Topics.General Survey of the Situation.The general situation is much more quiet than it was a fortnight ago, when it was disturbed by a large number of wage demands in important industries, and the prospect of reaching a settlement on all of these without a strike seemed somewhat remote. During the past fortnight, however, a settlement has been reached on all the matters on which the Transport Workers&apos; Federation was negotiating, and the agreements have been received with satisfaction on the whole, although local strikes have taken place owing to opposition to the tramway settlement. From the latest information, it seems probable that the ballot vote of the miners will show a majority in favour of acceptance of the Governments offer.The Easter week-end saw a large number of annual conferences of trade unions and socialist parties. The main subject of interest at the conferences of the latter has been the question of their International affiliation.The Unemployment Position.The reduction in the number of .H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged for the week ended the 26th March, 1920, was 13,025 compared with a reduction of 12,572 between the 12th March and 19th March, 1920. The number of H.M. Forces policies remaining lodged at the 27th March was 237,626 by men and 2,882 by women, making a total of 240,508.82,843 unemployment books remained lodged by workers under the Unemployment Insurance Acts at the 26th March, making a reduction of 5,271 since the 19th March. At the previous week there were 60,709 books lodged by males and 27,305 by females.At the 19th March, 337 policies remained lodged by short time workers of which 280 were in the insured industries (chiefly in engineering and ironfounding) and 57 in the un-insured. At the week ended the 12th March there were 467 short-time policies remaining lodged, compared with 1,420 a month ago.At the 26th March, the Employment Exchange live registers showed 301,897 men, 50,208 women, 20,142 juveniles, compared with 322,616 men, 51,487 women, 20,527 juveniles a week ago, and 369,802 men, 53,20T women, 22,030 juveniles a month ago.Increased Production.The Ministry of Labour has set up a Committee to consider and advise as to the best means of securing the greatest possible production consistent with the permanent well-being of industry and of the employers and the workpeople engaged therein. The Committee is as follows : Sir Stephenson Kent, K.C.B. (chairman); Mr. I. Haig-Mitchell, Lieut.-Col. D. Paul, C.M.G. (Government representatives); Mr. A. A. Purcell, Mr. G. H. Stuart-Bunning, J.P., O.B.E. (T.U.C. representatives); Sir Thomas Robinson, M.P., and Sir Allan M. Smith, K.B.E., M.P. (Employers&apos; representatives). It is also provided that additional representatives will be appointed two by employers, and two by workpeople -to represent any particular trade which may be under consideration by the Committee. The first trade to which the Committee will give attention will be the building trade, and the Ministry of Labour is in communication with the National Industrial Council for the Building Trade with a view to the nomination of representatives to act as members of the Committee while matters concerning the building trade are under consideration.The Miners.;,: The miners throughout the country are at present considering what attitude they should adopt towards the Governments offer. It was decided at the delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, held on the 29th March, to take a ballot of the Federation on the following terms : (1) Are you in favour of a stoppage of work to enforce the claims put forward by the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain on behalf of their members for an advance in wages of 3s. per shift flat rate for all persons over 16 years of age, and Is. 6d. per shift flat rate for all persons below 16, to commence as from the 1st March ? (2) Are you in favour of accepting the Government offer of a 20 per cent, advance on gross wages, excluding war wage and Sankey wage, with a guaranteed flat rate of 2s. per shift advance for persons of 18 years and upwards, Is. per shift for persons between 16 and 18, and 9d. per shift for persons below 16, to commence as and from 12th March ? The ballot papers are returnable to the offices of the Federation on or before the 14th April, and the result of the vote will be announced at a national conference of
(C 1981)Z.the Federation to be held on the following day. It is noteworthy that neither the executive nor the delegate conference made any recommendation with regard to acceptance or rejection of the Governments terms. The Federation has issued a statement which is being circulated throughout the country, explaining the effect of the Governments pro-posal. In various districts conferences of local executives or of delegates have been held to consider the matter. A special delegate conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federa-tion, held at Cardiff on the 1st April, strongly recommended the South Wales miners to vote against the acceptance of the Governments offer. A conference of Scottish miners&apos; delegates, at Glasgow, on the 2nd April, agreed to accept the recommendation of the Scottish Executive to advise the miners of Scotland to reject the Governments offer. A special conference of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners&apos; Federation has passed a recommendation in the same sense. The executive committees of the Durham Miners&apos; Federation and the North Staffordshire Miners&apos; Federation have decided to advise their members to accept the Governments offer. No definite recommendation has yet been made by the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Association, but Mr. Herbert Smith, at a meeting of the Yorkshire Miners&apos; Council, on the 1st April, stated that the Yorkshire officials who had been engaged in negotiations advised the Council to recommend the acceptance of the Governments offer.The strongest opposition to the acceptance of the Government offer undoubtedly comes from South Wales, and it is clear that the possibility of sectional action in that coalfield is causing grave anxiety to the officials of the M.F.G.B. Mr. Frank Hodges, in the &quot; Daily Herald,&quot; on the 1st April, made a strong appeal for national unity among the miners in accepting the terms, and maintained that those in tH more favoured districts who would advocate sectional action were unworthy of the confidence of the rank and file. The writer of &quot; South Wales Notes &quot; in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; gives an account of a report on the series of conferences of the M.F.G.B., given by Mr. A. J. Cook, a South Wales miners&apos; agent, who throws some interesting sidelights on the disharmony that existed at the conference. He.points out that the reason for the strong opposition of the Welsh delegates to the percentage offer is that it is entirely foreign to the policy of the Welsh miners, and if it were accepted, it would mean the undoing of several years&apos; pro-paganda. There is a movement in South Wales to carry propaganda into other coal-fields, in order that the South Wales programme shall not be held back by &quot; reactionary &quot; leaders in other districts. There is also a widespread demand in South Wales, to which attention has previously been directed in this Report, for the abolition of control and a return to the method of regulating district wages by district prices.Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement.A special conference of trade unionists and co-operators was held on the 27th March in London, and was presided over by Mr. T. B. Naylor, the Chairman of the London Joint Advisory Council of Trade Unionists and Co-operators. Mr. E. Bevin stated that,, in view of the Prime Ministers declaration against the Labour Party.a commissariat scheme for the whole country should he prepared for application at any opportunity. He wanted to see a trade union general staff, not organised for strike purposes alone, but for research, and other purposes of that sort, so that, when the capitalist system broke down, Labour would be able to set up a co-operative commonwealth. Mr. B. Williams moved a resolution condemning the Coalition Government for its active support of profiteering businesses, and urging that democratic co-operative methods combined with nationalisation of indus-tries should be adopted with a view to controlling trading companies in the interests of the community. Mr. W. T. A. Foot, Secretary of the London Council of the N.U.R., has published in pamphlet form a scheme for solidarity between trade unions and the co-opera-tive movement. This provides for strike pay of 24s. a week to be paid in goods rather than in money on a system of vouchers to be honoured by any London co-operative store. The scheme pre-supposes that the trade unions will pledge themselves to give financial support to the co-operative movement and that every trade unionist in the country will become a co-operator.. The Control of the Liquor Trade.The labour campaign for the public ownership and control of the liquor trade has been pursued vigorously since it was inaugurated at Carlisle on the 8th November, 1919. Mr. J: H. Thomas, M.P., is Chairman of the Committee, which is fully representative of the Labour Movement.   A large number of conferences, attended by delegates from trade
unions, co-operative societies and working men&apos;s clubs, have taken place ; and they have been addressed by, among others, Messrs. J. H. Thomas, J. R. Clynes, C. T. Cramp, John Hill, Frank Hodges, George Lansbury, R. B. Walker, Sidney Webb, Miss Margaret Bond-field, Miss Mary MacArthur, and Miss Susan Lawrence. A large amount of literature has been distributed in the form of handbills and leaflets and many pamphlets have been sold and circulated.   Several district conferences have been arranged to take place in April.Amalgamation.A joint meeting of the executives of the Friendly Society of Iron Founders, the Associated Iron Moulders of Scotland and the Amalgamated Society of Core Makers has declined for the present the proposal of fusion with the new Amalgamated Engineering Union. It is reported that the United Garment Workers&apos; Union and the Scottish Tailors and Tailoresses Union have both now secured the requisite majority in favour of amalgama-tion. The new union will be called the Tailors and Garment Workers&apos; Union. The Sheffield Trades and Labour Council have decided unanimously to amalgamate with the Sheffield Federated Trades Council. -Training for Women. A meeting was held on the 30th March to discuss the methods of administering the money allocated to the Central Committee on Women&apos;s Training and Employment by the Executive Committee of the National Relief Fund. The Chairman of the Central Committee is Lady Crewe and Miss Mary Macarthur is the lion, secretary. It is proposed to establish local interviewing committees in London, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Cardiff, and Bristol, and similar arrangements are under considera-tion for Scotland and Ireland. It is hoped that the Committee will be able to afford training for 5,000 women at an average cost of  .100 per head. Manual training is excluded from the scope of the scheme.Trade Union Topics.North Staffordshire Underground Colliery Firemen&apos;s, Shotlighters, and Overmen&apos;s Association. A recent meeting of this Association insisted that whatever concessions were granted to any class of worker in or about the mines must apply to the shotlighters, firemen and other men of that class. These men were not going to be placed in the category of minimum wage men. Their duties were laid down by the State and they were not content to be classed with any other body of workers.National Union of Railwaymen. Leicester No. 2 Branch of this Union protests against the proposal to have clerks in the head office who are members of organisations other than the N.U.R. The members of the branch fear that the proposal will lead to bureaucracy. The Newbury and Peterborough No. 4 Branches of the same Union request the executive to fix a date after which members should refuse to work with non-unionists.Union of Post Office Workers. At the first annual conference of the Union of Post Office Workers to be held in May the Executive Council will propose the institution of a strike policy as a permanent plank in the programme of the Union to be backed by a strike fund of Qd. per week per member. The resolution adds that, in order to secure the success of the Post Office strike policy arrangements should be entered into with other trade unions for concerted and common action. The Executive also submits a resolution on the general programme of the Union including full civil rights, joint management of the Post Office, an improved standard of life for the workers, maxima to be reached by steeper increments and in shorter periods, the abolition of the classification of offices, equal pay for equal work, irrespective of sex, a 38^-hour week of five days, and improved pensions. Bradford proposes that this conference &quot; instructs the executive to approach the Triple Alliance regarding the creation of a Quadruple Alliance in the event of the plebiscite vote on the subject of a strike fund being decided in the affirmative.&quot;Professional Workers. On the Provisional Council of the National Federation of Professional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Workers, the following Associa-tions are represented : Railway Clerks&apos; Association.Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen. Shipbuilding, Engineering and Steel Commercial Staffs&apos; Association. National Foremen&apos;s Association. Amalgamated Managers&apos; and Foremen&apos;s Association.
Scottish Foremen&apos;s Protective Association.National Association of Supervising Electricians.National Union of Dock, Wharves and Shipping Staffs.Shipping Clerical Staffs&apos; Guild.Variety Artists&apos; Federation. .National Union of Clerks.Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries;Commercial Travellers&apos; Association.National Union of Co-operative Officials.Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and Allied Workers.National Amalgamated Association of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks.National Orchestral Association.Electricity Supply Commercial Association.The Middle Classes Union has been increasingly active, but its functions appear to be exercised mainly in the political and municipal sphere.Ex-8ervice Men.Committee on Employment. The Minister has appointed a Committee, consisting of equal numbers of representatives of employers, trade unions, ex-Service men&apos;s organisa-tions, and the Ministry of Labour, to consider the best means of facilitating the re-employ-ment of ex-Service men and to make recommendations to the Minister. The members of the Committee are : Mr. T. W. Phillips, C.B.E. (Ministry of Labour) (chairman); Mr. J. A. Barlow, C.B.E. ; Mr. F. Bramley; Mr. E. J. Brown ; Mr. James A. Crerar; Mr. D. M. King ; Mr. D. S. Marjonbanks, C.B.E.; Mr. I. H. Mitchell; Mr. E. L. Poulton, O.B.E., J.P. ; Mr. A. A. Purcell; Mr. J. F. Ryan, O.B.E. ; Captain Donald Simpson.Conference of ex-Service Men. The Minister of Labour and Colonel Sir James Craig, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions, met on the 29th March representatives of the National Association of Sailors and Soldiers, the Comrades of the Great War, the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, and the Officers&apos; Association, to consider the establishment of a Standing Joint Committee whose objects would be : (a) to assist organisations of ex-officers and ex-Service men in their task of securing to their members and to ex-Service men of ELM. Forces generally full information as to the rights and privileges conferred upon them by the Crown and Parliament, and the enjoyment of such rights and privileges ; (b) to provide machinery for consultation between the Government and ex-members of H.M. Forces upon other questions affecting ex-Service officers, men and their dependents. A draft constitution for the proposed committee was discussed, and the representatives of the several organisations undertook to consult their executives as to the appointment of permanent representatives upon the Standing Joint Committee.National Union of ex-Service Men. It is now reported that this Union is affiliated to the International Bureau of ex-Service men&apos;s organisations, and is to be represented at the forthcoming conference of ex-soldiers unions of France, Germany, Austria, Italy,, and other countries.Independent Labour Party.The annual conference of the I.L.P. opened at Glasgow on the 4tli April. 415 delegates were present. A presidential address was delivered by Mr. Philip Snowden. The most important subject of discussion at the conference was the question of the international affiliation of the I.L.P. A resolution was moved by Mr. Heron (Preston) instructing the National Administrative Council to withdraw from the second International. He main-tained that all now realised that the Second International was dead, and they had to decide either to affiliate to the Third International or to form a new International. To join Moscow, he maintained, was not to follow a will-o&apos;-the-wisp, but an experiment which had succeeded. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald pleaded for further inquiry before a definite decision was reached. The position here was not the position in Russia, and people who began by assuming that it was were simply playing at nursery politics. Mrs.. Philip Snowden opposed withdrawal from the Second International, and maintained that it could be influenced in the right direction by the I.L.P. and the &quot; now International-minded &quot; Labour Party. After further discussion, a vote was taken. Voting was by card, and on the question of withdrawing from the Second International the figures were as follows : for withdrawal, 529 ; against withdrawal, 144. The conference then pro-ceeded to vote on the proposal to join the Third International or to invite the Swiss party(C 1981) Z 2
to arrange for a consultation regarding the possibility of re-establishing one all-inclusive International.The result of the vote was : for immediate affiliation to Moscow, 206 ; for further consultation, 472. The resolution which was thus adopted by the Conference is as follows : This conference endorses the decision of the National Administrative Council to invite the Swiss party to arrange for a consultation regarding the possibility of the re-establishment of one all-inclusive International for the purpose of formulating a basis for an International which, while making a quite definite pronouncement of our Socialist objective, would allow the national sections to adapt their policies to the differing political and industrial conditions in their various countries ; and that after consultations and inquiries are completed, a special conference be called to consider the report.This decision is an important one, which, from the standpoint of the I.L.P., indicates that it is unable at present to accept the doctrines of the Third International, but that it is definitely convinced that the path of progress does not lie with the present Second International. The future of the Second International would seem to be very doubtful. The only important parties which now remain in it are the British Labour Party, the Belgian Labour Party, and the German Majority Socialists, all of which are considered particularly reactionary by the Left Wing Parties. What Socialist parties are now aiming at is some mediating influence to retain what they consider good in the Second, while incorporating what they consider good in the Third. It may be recalled that the decision of the recent French Socialist Congress at Strasburg was very similar to that of the I.L.P. It decided to withdraw from the Second International, not to adhere immediately to the Third, but to promote a mediating conference, as had formerly been suggested by the German Independent Socialists.British Socialist Party.The ninth annual conference of the B.S.P. took place at Bethnal Green on the 4th and 5th April. This Party is affiliated to the Third International. A resolution was passed pledging the branches and members of the British Socialist Party to do everything in their power to bring about a complete cessation of work on May Day this year as an expression of the solidarity of the British workers with the Russian Soviet Republic. Resolutions were passed reiterating the adhesion of the Party to the Communist platform, and an amendment declaring that political action should be continued in conjunction with the rest of the workers was defeated ; but a resolution was passed postponing the question of withdrawing from the Labour Party. On this matter, the position of the B.S.P. is peculiar. Though its views are very much at variance with those of the Labour Party, it is anxious not to lose the affiliation to that Party which it secured in 1916.International Labour Office.The meeting of the governing body of the International Labour Office, the first sessions of which were reported upon in the last issue of this Report, concluded on the 26th March. A general discussion took place on the proposed inquiry in Russia. It was decided to accept the suggestion of the League of Nations to nominate a worker and an employer as members of the Committee of Inquiry which is being sent by the League. Nevertheless, the governing body did not consider it possible that members so nominated could be members of both Commissions. It was resolved that the International Labour Office Commission should be confined to the objects assigned to the International Labour Organisation by Part 13 of the Treaty of Peace. The Commission will consist of twelve members, two proposed by the Government members of the governing body, five by the employers, and five by the workers&apos; members. An International Commission to study the question of emigration has been set up to consist of a chairman, six Government representatives, six employers&apos; representatives, and six workers. Nine of the eighteen members will be from European,. the remainder to be from extra-European, countries. Arrangements for the International Labour Conference for 1921 were also discussed, it was resolved that the Conference should take place early in that year at Geneva, the following subjects to be included in the agenda : (1) Steps taken in various countries to carry out the decisions of the washington and Genoa Conferences. (2) Agricultural questions.(a) The adaptation to agriculture of the decisions of the Washington Conference as to hours of work, unemployment and the protection of women and children;
D. J. SHACKLETON,Secretary.All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to :-Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London. S.W. 1.(b) Technical agricultural training ;(c) Hygiene;(d) Right of agricultural workers to form trade unions ;(e) Protection against accidents, sickness, invalidity and old age.(3) Industrial diseases.(a) Disinfection of wool infected with anthrax; (6) The use of white lead in painting.(4) Report of the Commission on Emigration.(5) Revision of the composition of the governing body and any necessary alteration in. the statutes.
