&apos; ipysSnint Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade &quot;\*. \\ and the Secretary for Scotland.ffTA^E&apos;!!! to extend Part IV of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894,to Scottish fishing vesselsThe Bill extends to Scotland tho provisions of tho Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, which deal with fishing boats, Scotland having hitherto been expressly exempted in certain respects from their operation.The Scottish Office, the Fishery Board for Scotland, and the owners of Scottish fishing vessels have for many years asked for this extension, and it was reported that the men&apos;s Unions also wanted it.    The Board of Trade sent an experienced officer to visit the Scottish fishing ports at the end of last year with instructions to go into the matter fully, and. he found that all parties, owners, shippers and fishermen were generally in favour of the extension.The effect of the extension will be to bring Scottish fishermen under the discipline sections of the Merchant Shipping Act and to provide for the. settlement of disputes between Scottish skippers and fishermen by Superintendents of Mercantile Marine Offices4    It will require agreements with the crews in the case of Scottish trawlers of 25 tons and upwards, together with an account cf wages for.each man and &quot;a certificate cf discharge.The Bill makes an alteration in the law which is desired by the Scottish fishing industry, and is not likely to be opposed*    We ask for sanction to its introduction.R4So HomeRobert Munro7th April, 1920*
