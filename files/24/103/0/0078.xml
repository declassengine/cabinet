Hl&apos;8 OrltanKis P^S^fi^*I22&amp;OREL,(P 2805)/&apos;Vojh Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department,13th April 1920.riority A.Your telegram No. 296 S., dated 13th March. Afghanistan. I do not think question of arms will present insuperable difficulty in event of satisfactory treaty of friendship. If effect of treaty is to restore British control in substance, if not in name, over Afghan foreign relations, export of arms could be justified under Article 1 of Convention, permitting signatories to export arms for their own requirements. If, on other hand, treaty crystallises Afghan independence, it will be open to Afghanistan to adhere to Convention and thus become eligible under same article to be supplied with arms for Governmental purposes.   Foreign Office concur.As regards Nepal, Foreign Office agree that export of arms is permissible. Question of Tibet still under consideration.
