0P. 1015__^^^t^laie to the Cabinet a Memorandum on a ease in which dispute has arisen betweenJndia Office and the Ministry of Shipping.   1 should be glad if my colleagues would consider the advisability of nominating one of their number to act as arbitrator in the case,E. S. M.6th April 1920.f)Rates of Freight to be Paid to the Ministry of Shippingby the India Office.Indian Office Memorandum.The decision of the Cabinet is required in connection with the question of the rates of freight to be paid to the Ministry of Shipping by the India Office on stores, the property of the Government of India, shipped to India between (a) The 1st January 1918 and 15th December 1918.(b) The 16th December 1918 and loth February 1919.The rates were fixed in advance by the Ministry of Shipping on estimates of the cost of carriage for the periods in question, and were to bo applicable to all Government stores shipped during these periods.   The basic rate was 125s. per ton for period (a) and 75s. per ton for period (b).The India Office contends that these rates are high and that fair basic rates would be 75s. per ton for (a), 60s. per ton for (b).Pending settlement the India Office has. only paid two-thirds of the freight claimed for period (a) and nothing so far for period (6).As regards period fa), the India Office contention is based on the following grounds: (1) Directly the rate was promulgated oral representations were made to the Ministry of Shipping that it was far too high, but these were disregarded.(2) The Ministry of Shipping admit that when fixing the rate they overlooked the fact that the freight on Government of India stores would be paid out of Indian revenues, and that these revenues would suffer if the rate fixed was too high, whereas under the system of account set up by the Ministry any excess of freight paid out of the Imperial revenues on behalf of departments chargeable thereto would come back to those revenues through the Ministry of Shipping. It is on this ground that the India Office urges that the rate for Government of India stores should be based on actual costs and not on an estimate.(3) The rate of 125s. fixed by the Ministry of Shipping depended largely on two factors : (x) the estimated average time occupied by vessels on the round voyage to and from India ; and (y) the estimated proportion which, on an average, the tonnage carried would bear to the full capacity of the ship. Under (as) the voyage period was estimated at 160 days, and under (y) the tonnage carried was estimated at one-third full outwards and full homewards. The India Office maintains that actual figures during 1918 will show that the voyage period was estimated too high and the tonnage carried too low.(4) The actual experience of running prize and detained ships for the Government of India points to 75s. being a fair rate. This is confirmed by information obtained confidential -tially from one of the Conference lines of steamers trading between the United Kingdom and India, and is borne out by the opinion of shipping experts who have been consulted orally. In arriving at the rate of 75s. the actual running cost of prize ships was taken, and the extra cost which would have been incurred had they been employed as regular cargo liners was added thereto.(5) The rate of 125s. per ton was charged to the India Office for such stores as steel - and iron, light measurement, joists, tin plates, and many other stores, but, during the same period, rates of 60s. to 90s, per ton, less 5 per cent., were being charged for similar cargoes to private shippers.   Such stores formed no inconsiderable part of the India Office consignments.The India Office case in regard to period (b) is based on the arguments put forward respecting period (a) as modified by the fact that by 15th December 1918 marine war risks had been nearly eliminated. The India Office is advised and considers that 60s. would be a fair all-round rate for all descriptions of ordinary stores, including steel, light measurement, &amp;c, during the period (b).At present, and since March of last year, for steel, light measurement, &amp;c, the India,Office pays only 47s. 6cZ. per ton, and for rails only 40s. per ton.While it is considered that the rates suggested, namely, 75s. per ton for period (a) and 60s. for period ib), are equitable, the India Office proposed in November last as a compromise the substitution of 83s. M. and 75s. respectively.As the Ministry of Shipping decline to accept this compromise, the India Office asks that - the average cost of carriage may be ascertained from the actual figures relating to the voyages made in the two periods, and the rates adjusted accordingly.India Office,Whitehall,10  1227     106 4.20
