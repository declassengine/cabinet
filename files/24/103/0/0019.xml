Joi9    rn^m......S,iLS OF SUBlvL.RIKWS TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.Admiralty Memorandum for the Cabinet,J I  \ 3On the re commendation of the Admiralty it was decided by the Cabinet Finance Committee on October 8th.1919 that Submarines should net be sold to Foreign Governments.2,,-       Since this decision was taken it has become apparent that the British policy in favour of the abolition of submarines is unlikely to be generally adopted*    The United States of America have 40 Submarines under construction at the present time, and there is no indication that they intend to adopt the policy of abolition. In France, opposition to the British proposal is very strong, and 10 ax-German Submarines have been added to the French Navy in order to obtain the consent of the French Government for the destruction of the remainder,,3 In these circumstances the Admiralty ask that thequestion may be reconsidered, and that approval may be given for the sale of two Submarines to the Greek Government inIcompliance with a definite request which haE been receivedP4t- The Head of the British Naval Mission at Athens, inforwarding the proposals of thn Greek Government for the purohase of warships, including two submarines, states that if Greeoe is unable to obtain Submarines from this country it is anticipated that the ord^r for these boats will b* placed in France.(IhtId.)
