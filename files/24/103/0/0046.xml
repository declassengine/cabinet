:   DocyTwnt is the property his ::/:c&apos;:v.\v)&apos;.z iv.i.l3sty&apos;s Government.Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.India Office, Whitehall, My clear Hankey, 9th April 1920.With reference to the resolution of the British Empire Delegation, dated 20th January 1919 (B.E.D., 2nd Minutes, page 7), I submit: (1) A memorandum on the proposed peace with Turkey for circulation to theCabinet and the British Empire Delegation. (2) A copy of that memorandum for submission to the Peace Conference from . ; which those passages of purely Imperial concern have been omitted.. Yours sincerely,E. S. Montagu.The Draft Peace Treaty with Turkey.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.1 invite attention to the clauses of the Draft Peace Treaty with Turkey which have been circulated during the past few weeks. They are admittedly provisional,&apos;^&quot; and I should be failing in my duty, both to India and to the Cabinet, if I refrained from pointing out in the time that is left the disastrous consequences which must result if they are adopted in their present form.There can he no question as to the canons of criticism.(1) The Treaty must conform exactly to all pledges given. (2) It must impose a peace that can be enforced and may be reasonably expected to endure.This much we owe to the world ; bat we owe it also to our own peoples that the peace should not be disruptive of the Empire.I must emphasise our pledges, for it is beyond contention that the Prime Ministers speech! of 26th February had changed the basis of argument. Before the delivery of that speech it had been argued that the declaration was only an offer to the Turks. The argument was one against which I had consistently protested, but had had to recognise as a possible basis of negotiation. It has now been swept away, and with it must go any admissions that may have been based upon it.We now know that the declaration of January 1918 was a pledge, and we have to fulfil it. More, as the Prime Minister has clearly shown, we have to satisfy the Moslems of the Empire that we are fulfilling it. If the British word is not trusted it would be &quot; fatal &quot; for us- a solemn appreciation of the situation to which there can be nothing to add.I ask, then, that these canons be applied to certain broad proposals in the Treaty.II. Firstly, Thrace.   We are pledged not to deprive Turkey &quot;of the rich and &apos; renowned lands of Thrace which are predominantly Turkish.&quot;  The proposal of the Conference is to deliver the whole of Thrace in Turkey to Greece.Addressing the Khilafat deputation, the Prime Minister said: &quot; It is very difficult to get the facts about Thrace, but I have got before me here the Turkish census and the Creek census about Thrace. There is very little difference between them. According, to both of these the Mussulman population in Thrace is in a considerable minority. If that is true, and the principle of self-determination is to be applied, the whole of Thrace would certainly be taken away from Turkish rule.&quot;* &quot; Lord Curzon pointed out that all the decisions of the Conference were provisional in character and subject to the approval and sanction of the Supreme Council.&quot; Extract from notes of a Conference of Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers, dated 29th March.I &quot;That declaration (of national war aims in January 1918) was unqualified and was very deliberate. . . . This was not an offer to the Turks. . . . We gave a solemn pledge and they (the Mahomniedans of India) accepted it, and they are disturbed at the prospect of our not abiding by it. . . . There is nothing which would damage British power in Asia more than the feeling that you could not trust the British word. That is the danger. &quot; Of course, it would be a fatal reputation for us.&quot;  Prime Minister, 26th February.10   1281-1     100 4.20 A
I venture to think that there has been some mistake ; and that the figures supplied to the Conference were not based on the Turkish census, but were extracted from the Memorandum by M. Veniselos, the most interested of all witnesses. They are dated 1912, and are understood to class as &quot;non-Turk&quot; persons described as &quot;Bulgarian-Moslems &quot; and. &quot; Greek-Moslems.&quot; This last argument is one which I can hardly follow, and certainly distrust. Are Dutch-Americans and Italian-Americans less Americans than Irish-Americans and Scotch-Americans ? Is it inconceivable that Turkish nationals, though originally of foreign descent, may prefer to remain Turkish ? But assume that the racial classification is correct, there is still no reason whatever to believe that the so-called &quot;Bulgar&quot; Moslems and &quot;Greek&quot; Moslems would opt for Greece. Indeed, there is reason to the contrary. Not only is the Mussulman generally more susceptible to ties of religion than race, but we have a historical precedent particularly in point. Cuinet (Vol. I., page 809) writes of Konia : &quot;An sud du vilayet on rencontre bon nombre de musuhnans qui out emigre &quot; de la Grece apres la guerre de lTndepen dance ; ils parlent le grec en famille ; leur &quot; fernmes out conserve le type grec tres prononce.&quot; These are the class of people who swell M. Veniselos&apos; non-Turk lists. On the other hand, there is the over-whelming conviction among Moslems that the Turks are in the majority ;* there is distrust in the Foreign Office of M. Veniselos&apos; claims; there is the positive acceptance! by General Milne, in November 1919, of the Turkish figures for 1914; and there is Admiral do Robeck&apos;s recent telegram (received-7th April, No. 348) pointing out that the Turks claim to form GO per cent, of the population of Eastern Thrace and to own 85 per cent, of the land.   The figures quoted by General Milne are :--&quot;Adrianople Vilayet.-Turks, 362,000; Greeks, 225,000; Armenians, 19,500. Total. 685,500.&quot;It has been agreed that the Moslem world must be satisfied of our good faith-If the census is to-refer back to the pre-Balkan war days 1912, then this must be announced and an opportunity given to the Turks to prepare a statement on this basis.The Khilafat deputation were assured that the same principles which were applied to defeated European Powers would be applied to Turkey. In the case of the German and Austrian Treaties doubtful figures were carefully verified before final decisions were taken. In some cases plebiscites were arranged even though reason-ably accurate records were available. We are hound to be equally scrupulous in our dealings with Turkey. But it is submitted that the evidence on which the proposals regarding Thrace are based is totally inadequate to support the conclusions drawn, and can cany conviction to no one. On the contrary, the most recent and only reliable figures show an overwhelming majority of Turks over Greeks for Western and Eastern Thrace. If, therefore, we are to avoid the &quot; fatal reputation for breach of faith, the future of Thrace must be reconsidered.III. The pledge applies equally to Smyrna. Turkey is to retain lands pre-dominantly Turkish. But what is proposed? The Smyrna Commission recommend the handing over to Greece of 18 kazasj, or districts, of which on their own figure not more than five contain 60 per cent, and upwards of Greeks, while not more than 11 in all contain a majority of non-Turks. And even as regards these there is no evidence that the Greek inhabitants would not prefer Turkish to Greek rule. It is said that there are some who are so hostile to their compatriots as to be actually helping Mustapha Kamal. To these 111 districts, six others, admittedly Turkish, have been added in order to secure a strategic frontier for the 11)1 so-called Greek districts.   And of these six, two contain over 80 per cent..of Turkish population.No one is more sensible of the services of Monsieur A^eniselos than I: and the services^&quot; of his countrymen in the war call for no comment. If the circumstances,of his&quot; people were comparable to the circumstances of the other nations whom we have just liberated, or are about to liberate, no one more gladly than I would assist in the liberation. But such liberation must be effected within the.terms of our pledge ; and any promise that may have been made to Monsieur Venizelos must be conditioned by* Appendix I. * Appendix II.t There are no figures available for the district of Nif. ^ Appendix III.II The figures are not above suspicion. Whereas, with the exception of Smyrna, the population is -shown as either Greek or Turk, Cuinet shows that 25 years ago 17 of these villages had in addition to these races &quot; others,&quot; i.e., Jews, &amp;c, all of whom in this table have become &quot; Greeks.&quot; In four of the eleven, 47 o/0 or more are admittedly Turk.*i\ Appendix IY.
o that pledge.   If the liberation of 11 can be secured only by the enslavement0 of six, then we must forego the liberation.But the fact of our promise is not the only argument. 1 would urge that no peace containing these provisions can bo permanent.&apos; The Turks are not likely to submit without fresh bloodshed to the surrender of Smyrna this making of the man the master, and of the master the man they will never rest while Smyrna is irredenta. Again the fruits of victory may go to Greece; but the blame and the burning hatred will be laid up for Great Britain. A friendly Turkey profits us : an incensed Turkey will never cease to foment trouble in India. These proposals then are desperately inexpedient. Further, we are warned on every hand that they are impossible of achievement, and will provoke renewed massacres of unprotected Christians. Admiral de Robeckf in Constantinople, the War Office J in London, Marshal Foch in France are united in this, that the peace which is contemplated cannot be enforced without many more troops than those now available. And whence are they to come ? Not from India. The Government of India will be bound to recall even those troops which are being employed during the armistice. I submit that we cannot find the 20 to 30 divisions we are told are necessary. The proposals in my judgment not only do not constitute a fair interpretation of the pledge, but are not politic, expedient, or practicable.IV. Armenia and Chaldsea. Whatever be the frontiers eventually accepted, there must remain Christians under Moslem and Moslems under Christian rule. The settle-ment, therefore, should be such as to give to neither reasonable cause for bitterness against the other. It is now certain that no Power will accept a mandate for Armenia; it is therefore essential that the new republic be on friendly relations with her Western neighbour. These conditions are possible only if the frontier&apos; of Armenia is drawn east of Erzerum. Any other alternative will provoke continuous warfare in a region in which the Allied Powers cannot be expected to operate.Similarly the safety of the Chaldaeans depends on the settlement of Kurdistan ; and, unless Turkey is friendly, Kurdistan will be disturbed. The extension of the frontiers of Armenia which is at present contemplated will, I am convinced, prove a source of grave danger to those very communities whom it is desired to protect.V. I do not wish to burden this memorandum with detailed criticisms, many of which will disappear when these general protests are accepted. But the following points cannot be altogether passed over : (lj The provisions in the minority treaty regarding Turkish property in &quot; Greece &quot; require modification. The only persons fully protected are such minority bodies as are Greek nationals.   The Turkish majority is not-protected.$ &quot; They (Turks) will be entitled to retain their immovable property in Greek territory ; they may carry with them their movable property of every description.&quot; It is monstrous that no Turk should be entitled to retain his movable property in his homelands now to be transferred to Greece. Assurance of life and liberty.is insufficient.(2) Whereas mosques,jj cemeteries and other Mussulman religious establishments are to be &quot; protected,&quot; it is only &quot; buildings set apart for Moslem worship in the town of Aclrianople &quot; which are to be &quot; inalienable.&quot; The insertion of this latter clause cannot fail to occasion grave doubts as to the adequacy of the contemplated protection. It may be thought that 1 am meticulous and distrustful of the Greeks. I would call to mind the words of M. Scialoja at the morning conference of Ambassadors on 29th March, when, referring to the land proposals of Mons. Veniselos, lie said : &quot;The reforms Afons. Veniselos had in mind almost amounted to confiscation, which might take place very rapidly.&quot; As to the dealing which minorities may expect under Greek rule, I would refer to the contradictory recommendations of the Greek delegation in regard to proportional representation.   They pressed^ for it in* Vide terms of Greek Minority Treaty. Adequate protection is afforded only to Turks who accept Greek Nationality.   CP. 985, dated 29th March.t CP. 967, dated 26tli March, also telegrams dated 25th March, No. 285, and 1st April, No. 317 :-.&quot; If peace terms were appreciably less drastic than those above indicated, it might even now be-possible to pursue policy of Bloc round Sultan composed of elements ready to accept them rather than risk complete ruin likely to result from further armed struggle with Allies.&quot;X &quot; Appreciation by the General Staff of the present situation &quot; dated 15th March, also Memorandum, dated 1st April.g Article 3, Minority Treaty (CP., dated 29tli March). -II Articles 14 and 15, Greek Minority Treaty.&apos;[ CP. 912, dated 19th March, &quot; Observations by Greek Delegation.&quot;A 2
* I.C.P. 87, dated 27th March.t CP. 897, dated 18th March.Turkey, but they refused it in Adrianople.&apos;:::&apos; . . . . &quot;A. system of proportional &quot; representation might be regarded as inapplicable even in the newly acquired &quot; territory seeing that the populations there are unaccustomed to elections of any kind.&quot;(3) The treatment of Smyrna.! Turkey is to be allowed &quot; suzerainty&quot; ; suzerainty is defined as the flying of a flag on one fort. At the end of two years of Greek pressure, the Smyrna Parliament is to be allowed to opt to enter permanently into Greece. She is not to be allowed to opt to return to Turkey. Hardest measure of all, there is to be a customs service between, the Smyrna area and the remainder of the Turkish territory. The proposals appear to take away from Turkey the one great port that is left to her, and to place a customs barrier to strangle her trade. I can-not believe that the proposal to give these districts to Greece will be persisted in. If it is, and this further proposal is approved, then Turkey may well decide to struggle to the death.   For these proposals spell economic death.(4) The Treaty contemplates mandates for Syria, Mesopotamia and Palestine. Had there been fulfilment of the original intention to provide mandatory powers for all the new States into which Turkey is to, be dismembered, I should have agreed. But since there is to be no mandate for Turkey proper, the term has come to be interpreted as involving subjection. I would submit that in order to avoid any suggestion that our occupation is permanent, designed for exploitation, or is in any way annexation in disguise, it would be far better to. take the opportunity we desire of inaugurating the new regime and of establishing a reign of order by establishing Governments in these countries and concluding with them treaties under the terms of which we offer and they accept our help.(5) The financial clauses show signs of hasty drafting, e.g. (a) Article 1.0. State property which is not &quot;registered&quot; should pass to the new State as well as registered. It is doubtful whether all, or even most, State land in Mesopotamia is registered.(b) Article 15. I note that it is proposed to fasten a financial burden on Mesopotamia with effect from 1st March 1920, and this without consultation of the Minister responsible.(c) lb idem. Under the economic clauses Mesopotamia is to pay to the Baghdad Railway Company, or its representatives, the value of the Mesopotamian section of the line. Under the financial clauses it is also to be responsible for repayment of the debt created to finance the railway. In other words, the new State of Mesopotamia is required to pay twice over.(c) Article 1.6. I protest most strongly against the elimination of a Turkish representative from the Council of the Debt. There has always been such a repre-sentative, and no reason is advanced for the proposed change.I have dealt with these points, great and small, in separate detail, and explained the resentment which each is likely to provoke. If all are allowed to stand, the cumulative effect will be infinitely greater. I am forced to the conviction that these proposals will find little support in this country; and in the East will result in an upheaval, the end of which it is impossible to forecast.VI. These criticisms have been destructive.   My constructive suggestions are (1) That we should keep our pledge by leaving Thrace, including Adrianople,to the Turk. ^J.(2) That we should leave Smyrna to (**eek sovereignty.(3) That after a careful analysis of the population as it is to clay, we should force Turkey to arrange for local autonomy for Thrace and Smyrna, which will give the Greek and other non-Turk communities under the Turkish flag full citizenship and representation in proportion to their numbers on all executive, legislative and judicial bodies.(4) No annexation, disguised or direct, but National Governments in Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.Finally, I think that something should be said in the Treaty to make clear our attitude towards religious questions. Silence will be misinterpreted ; and the Treaty should be accompanied by a declaration that the Allies are not concerned with the religious authority of the Caliph, or with any arrangement of a religious nature which bis Moslem folloAvers in any State, whether of old or new Turkey, may make with him of their own accord.
* Minutes 13 B, and P. Conference, page 2&apos;.[Appendices.VII. I feel that I owe a word of explanation as to why the case put forward in -this memorandum is submitted thus at the eleventh hour and was not put before the Conference when in session. It will he remembered that the British Empire Delegation&apos;11&apos; decided that the Commission which was to consider the administration of all the territories of old Turkey was to contain a member of the Indian Delegation ; and as the Peace Conference which has been working in London during the past seven weeks is the lineal descendant of that Commission, it will naturally be expected that the Indian Delegation has been represented.   The Conference will be as astonished asI was, on return from convalescence, to find that the representative whom I had appointed had been consistently refused a hearing on these points. The reasons for this refusal are still to seek, but the fact remains that the opportunity to present these facts at an earlier stage has been denied me.Conclusion.VIII. I am glad to note that, so far as I am aware, and despite the Allied occupation of Constantinople, the Allies propose to leave the Turkish capital in the Turkish Empire. Any other decision would have been unthinkable, and I have not the slightest doubt that the wholly ill-founded rumour that the British Government had ever decided otherwise, and that the Allies were going to decide otherwise, was largely responsible for the deplorable massacres which have recently taken place in Asia Minor. The retention of Constantinople is a part fulfilment of the Prime Ministers pledge; but I must confess to grave uneasiness as to the atmosphere of reluctance with which it has been done.There are two possible courses open to the Allies. They could destroy Turkey, remain obdurate to the appeals of those who took so large a share in the conquest of Turkey, and face the consequence in the East; or they could make the peace upon the principles on which it is alleged to be founded, and, whilst meting out punish-ment for an unprovoked war and liberating those to whom we are pledged to give the. freedom they themselves demanded, grasp the magnificent opportunity to help a new Turkey on to its legs, shutting their ears to those nations who, under the guise of liberation of minorities and of races, look for an extension of their own prestige and territory, those who, while uttering sentiments of humanity and disinterestedness, seek for oil concessions, those who, while expressing sympathy with the difficult position of Mohammedans throughout the world, doubt their sincerity and calculate on their impotence. But the course which cannot be justified is to make a peace wdiich falters between two policies and attempts to compromise irreconcilable premises.Twice in the recent history of Turkey has Turkey looked to Great Britain for assistance. After the deposition of the old Sultan it was British diplomacy that threw the Turks into the arms of Germany. Germany duped them into a disastrous war. After the armistice once again we had our opportunity. It is not too late to take it.E. S. M.9th April 1920.
Reference No. I.C.P. 89.Extract from Notes of a Conference of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors heldon Tuesday, 30th March 1920.Mr. Vansittart said the Turkish figures for the Kaza of Adrianople were-53,000 Moslems, 36,000 Greeks, 15,000 miscellaneous (including Bulgarians).The figures of British experts were practically the same, only increasing the disproportion slightly against the Bulgarians. There was one point, however, on the frontier itself where there was a Bulgarian majority.Lord Cnrzon observed that the figures given not only militated against the Bulgarians, but for the Turks against the Greeks.Mr. Vansittart said the answer to this contention Avas that if the area to the South was to he Greek, it was strategically undesirable to leave the Turks on the Greek flank. If Greece was to go to the Chatalja lines she must have Adrianople. He quoted the following passage from a letter he had written to supply Mr. Lloyd George with data for his meeting with the Khilaphat delegation: &quot;The figures for Thrace are based on M. Venizelos&apos; figures for 1912 : Eastern Thrace (including half of the Sanjak of Chatalja) Greeks 313,000, Turks 225,000.&quot; Portion of Western Thrace ceded by Bulgaria Greeks 48,000, Turks 118,000 ; total, 361,000 Greeks, 343,000 Turks.&quot;These figures are taken straight from M. Veniselos, but differ slightly from his total, (1) because he excluded Xanthi as practically already assigned to Greece; (2) because he included Ortakeui, which remains Bulgarian; (3) because he included the whole Sanjak of Ghatalja, and at best it is only possible to give him half, i.e., up to the Chatalja lines. I must in honesty draw your attention to the fad that these figures are partisan, and they do rot probably represent the entire truth. Our Geographical Section calculates for Western and Eastern Thrace up to the Chatalja lines Turks 365,000, Greeks 292,000.&quot;These, however, are 1914 figures. Those of M. Venizelos are 1912; between these two dates come the Balkan Wars, when many Greeks were expelled, and this is to some extent borne out by the figures of our Geographical Section, which makes the Turkish totals almost identical with those of M. Venizelos, while making the Greek totals considerably less.&quot;The inference was that there might have been a Greek majority in the whole area before 1912, as during the Balkan Wars a vast number of Greeks had been expelled.APPENDIX II.General Milne&apos;s Estimate of Turkish Population, November 1919.Vilayet.
