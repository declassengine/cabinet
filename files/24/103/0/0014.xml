This document is the property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.absence of the Secretary of State for War, I circulate to the Cabinet the ote by the General SCaff on the Treaty of Peace with Turkey.PEEL.The War Office,1st April, 1920. :myWO.CyKNERAL STAFF MEMORANDUM ON THE TURKISH PEACE TREATY.11 &apos;&apos; With reference to Memoranda circulated by the Secretary of State for War tp the Cabinet on the 24th December, .1919?and 6th January, 1920^..... 1. The General Staff consider it necessary to draw attention to telegram No. 285,, da fed the 25th March, from His Majesty&apos;s High Commissioner at Constantinople to the foreign Office. While endorsing in every respect the tligh Commissioners appeal for an early decision, they, at the same time, must represent that there would seem to be little advantage in speeding up the proceedings of the Peace Conference merely with a view to an announcement for an announcements sake, and that more harm than good will be done to the British Empire by the premature disclosure of terms which there Eu-e ,no available means to enforce.2. Therefore, the General Staff would draw particular attention to the intimation conveyed by Admiral de Robeck in the above-mentioned telegram, that terms less cjrastic than those which have been indicated to him and offering the prospect of a peace tolerable to the Turks, might be secured without a further armed struggle between them and the Allies, which he appears to consider otherwise inevitable.The High Commissioner in his telegram refers to previous telegrams in which he has, indicated what he believes to constitute tolerable peace terms in Turkish eyes. It is not.known exactly to which telegrams he refers, but it is assumed that his telegram No. 176, dated the 29th February, is intended. This may be taken in conjunction with the identic telegram from the British, French and Italian High Commissioners, No. 211, dateotthe 10th March. &quot;,.i .,&apos;.,:3&apos;. It appears that the terms, to be tolerable to the Turks, should recognize Turkish sovereignty over Smyrna and Eastern Thrace, including Adrianople, and suzerainty over a substantial portion of the Eastern provinces of Asia Minor.i 4. In the ordinary course the General Staff would not feel it either proper, or incumbent upon them, to raise any question on what is primarily a political matter. Marshal Foch has, however, been asked what military action will be necessary to enforce the proposed peace terms, and the General Staff believe that the opinion of the Commission,presided over by the Marshal/closely coincides with their own as.regards the forces required, the strength of which it is understood is so great that there is no probability that the Allied Governments can provide them.5. They think it possible that, inspired by their special ambitions, the Greeks,, wdiose Army is the largest concentrated force available for operations against Turkey, may suggest that they are in a position to carry out the task without other Allied reinforcements.In their opinion such an offer, if accepted, would merely have a local effect, and further Greek ambitions without improving the general situation, while the situation of the Christian minorities and Armenians in remote parts of Turkey would be aggravated beyond hope of relief.6, The fact that they are unable to recommend military action on a large scale with the Allied forces as at present constituted and disposed in the Near East, and that the blockade cannot be effectively applied to Turkey, combined with the fact that the first shadow of the peace terms has resulted in the withdrawal of Allied military detachments from the Anatolian Railway, appears to justify the General Staff in suggesting that serious attention should now be paid to the representations of the political advisers in Constantinople, and that it may not yet be too late to reconsider the terms which it is proposed to impose upon Turkey, unless His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to face a further call for troops. There are now no reinforcements available, and indeed our military resources are strained to a dangerous, extent in meeting our existing commitments.(B2Q/160)   100  4/20  H&amp;S  8104wo
7. Though all reports agree that the invasion of Anatolia by Greece is the greatest source of irritation to the Turks, who consider it a dishonourable breach of the Armistice, it is the future of Armenia which most concerns the General Staff. They regret that they are now. in view of Marshal Fpch&apos;s opinion, unable to contemplate the present plan for the formation of an Armenian State as a practicable policy. It is true-that steps are being taken to provide armament for the Armenians, but there is now &quot;no guarantee that these arms will ever reach them without the assistance of a military expedition, nor is there any likelihood that they can arrive before the middle of May at the very earliest. Months must then elapse before the armament can be distributed and the personnel trained. During this period Armenia will be exposed to Turk and Tartar attack, while the Turks will remain in the territory which has been promised to her. Even after she has been armed, her power to establish or even to defend herself has yet to be demonstrated. In short, the General Staff fail to see how the State of Armenia, if it is to include any part of the former Turkish vilayets, can be established without the goodwill of Turkey, which can hardly be obtained if the present proposals are pursued.8. It appears, therefore, to the General Staff that the best interests of Armenia demand that her representatives should be told frankly that her existence as a self-contained State, if she desires to absorb any territory formerly Turkish, can only be guaranteed under Turkish suzerainty; there seems no reason why this should affect the interior economy of the intended State and it is believed that if these facts were once faced most of the difficulties connected with Armenia would disappear. The Turkish force at Erzerum might actually be withdrawn without an Allied expedition, while it might even be possible to secure a more favourable position for Armenia in Cilicia where they are now dependent on French protection, which has proved ineffective in spite of the comparatively large forces used for the purpose.9. The General Staff, who are concerned only with British interests, have no desire to labour the Greek question, but desire to record their opinion that there will be no satisfactory settlement of the Turkish question and consequently no reduction in British responsibilities until Greek ambitions are curbed. It follows that the Turks should retain their administrative position in, and access to Adrianople while Smyrna should remain under the Turkish flag unless the Allied Powers are prepared to make greatly increased forces available and to undertake operations on a scale sufficient to secure the practical elimination of Turkey.10. To sum up, the General Staff are of the opinion that to persist in the present proposals for peace with Turkey with existing forces at the disposal of the Allies is to risk a great blow to British prestige without any corresponding return and probably to cause massacres of Christians and Armenians on a scale unprecedented even in Turkey. 1The remarks of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the Conference held on the 29th March, when he stated that &quot; the decisions of the Conference are provisional in character and subject to the approval and sanction of the Supreme Oouncil,&quot; indicate that the opportunity for a revision of the Treaty has not yet passed; and this expression is strengthened by telegram No. 260 D., from the Foreign Office to Admiral de Robeck, dated the 30th March, in reply to his telegram No. 285, mentioned above, which gave rise to this paper. 1 ;;iGeneral Staff, c   : rThe War Office.1st April, 1920. &apos; !
