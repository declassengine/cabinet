SUPREME  COUNCIL.TURKISH FINANCIAL COMMISSION.Note by the Chairman covering revised Financial Clauses for insertion in Treaty of Peace with Turkey.At a meeting of the Conference of Foreign Ministers and Ambassadors held on the 4th March, 1920, the Draft Financial Clauses were referred back to the Financial Commission with a view (1) to the consideration of the question of reparations for minorities of Turkish subjects of non-Turkish race and to hear evidence on the subject from M. Veuizelos; (.2) to. drafting a clause regarding currency in the Smyrna area to be included in the part of the Treaty relating to that area; and (3) to reconsidering generally the question of reparations.We submit a separate report regarding minorities (A.J.-10.F&apos;), from which it will be seen that the Financial Commission are unanimously of opinion that no special provision for reparation for minorities should be included in the Financial Clauses of the Treaty.We have drafted and communicated to the Smyrna Commission a clause relating to currency in the Smyrna area.We have leconsidered the general question of reparations, and have attempted to define more clearly (a) the meaning of the word &quot; nationals &quot; and (&amp;) the nature of the damage for which Turkey is to make reparation.We have taken the opportunity to make various small alterations, all shown in italics in the reprint, which seemed to us desirable, and which do not in any way alter the intention of the draft as originally submitted.B.

[This SdCionorit ia the Property of His Britamyc Majestys Government.]       g 1[SECRET.iiKevised Draft Proposals for the Financial Conditions of Peace with Turkey.(After consideration by Supreme Council and Council of Foreign Ministers, and with, modifications, in italics, since suggested by the Financial Commission.)The Ottoman Government recognises that by joining in the war of aggression which Germany and Austria-Hungary wage against the Allied and Associated Powers, it has caused to the latter losses and sacrifices of all kinds for which it ought to make complete reparation.On the other hand, the Allied and Associated Powers recognise that the resources of Turkey are not sufficient to enable her to make complete reparation.In these circumstances, and inasmuch as the territorial rearrangements prescribed by this Treaty will leave to the Turkish State only a portion of the revenues o  the former Ottoman Empire, it is agreed that all claims against the Ottoman Government for reparation shall be waived by the Allied and Associated. Powers, subject only to the provisions of the financial and economic clauses of this Treaty.The Allied and Associated Powers, desiring to afford some measure of relief and assistance to the Turkish State, have agreed with the Turkish Government that a Financial Commission shall be appointed, consisting of one representative of each of the following Allied Powers, which are specially interested, viz., France, the British Empire and Italy, with whom there shall be associated a Turkish Commissioner in a consultative capacity; with the powers and duties set forth in the following articles.The Financial Commission shall take such steps as in its judgment are best adapted to conserve and increase the resources of the Turkish Government.The Budget to be presented annually by the Turkish Minister of Finance to Parliament shall be submitted, in the first instance, to the Financial Commission, and shall be presented to Parliaments in the form approved by that Commission. No modification intro-duced by Parliament shall be operative without the approval of the Financial Commission.The Financial Commission . shall supervise the . execution of the Budget and Financial Laws and Regulations of the Ottoman Empire. This supervision shall be exercised through the medium of the Turkish Inspectorate of Finance, whose appointment shall be subject to the approval and who shall be placed under the direct orders of the Financial Commission. The Ottoman Government undertakes to furnish to thisArticle 1.Article 2.[2752]B
Inspectorate all facilities necessary for the fulfilment of their task, and to take such action against unsuitable officials in the Financial Departments of the Govern-ment as the Financial Commission may suggest.Article 3.The Financial Commission shall,&apos; in addition, in agreement with the Council of the Ottoman Debt and the Imperial Ottoman Bank, undertake by such means as may be recognised to be opportune and equitable, the regulation and improvement of the Turkish currency.Article 4.The Ottoman Government undertakes not to contract any internal or external loan without the consent of the Financial Commission.Article 5.The Ottoman Government engages to pay for all loss or damage suffered by civilian nationals of the Allied and Associated Powers, as defined below, in respect of their persons or property, through the action or negligence of the Turkish authorities during the war to the date of the ratification of this Treaty, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty.Article 6.All the resources of the Turkish Government, save revenues conceded or hypothecated to the service of the Ottoman external debt (see Annex- I), shall be placed at the disposal of the Financial Commission, which shall employ them, as need arises, in the following manner: (i.) The first charge (after payment of the salaries and cm-rent expenses of the Financial Corn-mission and of the ordinary expenses of such Allied naval and military forces of occupation as may be maintained after the date of the ratification of this Treaty in territories re-maining Turkish) shall be the expenses of the Allied naval and military forces of occupation since the date of the Armistice of territory remaining Turkish, and the expenses of Allied naval and military forces of occupation of territories ceded under this Treaty by Turkey to a Power other than the Power which has borne the expenses of occupation.The amount of these expenses and of the annuities by which they shall be discharged will be determined by the Financial Commis-sion, which will so arrange the annuities as to enable Turkey to meet any deficiency that may arise in the sums required to pay that part of the interest on the external debt for which Turkey remains responsible.^ii.) The second charge shall be the indemnity which the Turkish Government shall pay, as above, towards the claims of the Allied Powers for loss or damage in respect of their persons or property suffered by their nationals, as defined in Article 52 of the Economic
Clauses, through the action of the Turkish Government during the war, due regard being had to the financial condition of the Turkish State, and the necessity for pro-viding for the essential expenses of its administration. The Financial Commission shall adjudicate on and provide for payment of all claims in respect to personal damage. The claims in respect to property shall be investigated, determined and paid in accord&apos; ance with the Economic Clauses of the Treaty (Article 28).The Financial Commission shall fix the annuity to be applied to the settlement of claims in respect of persons as well as in respect of property should the funds at the disposal of the Allied and Associated Powers (Economic Clauses, Articlp 28) be insufficient to meet this charge, and shall determine the currency in which the annuity shall be paid.Article 7. .Any hypothecation of Turkish revenues effected during the war in respect of obligations (including the internal debt) contracted by the Turkish&apos; Government during the war is hereby annulled.Article 8.Turkey recognises the transfer to the Allied Powers of any claims to payment or repayment which Germany, Austria, Hungary or Bulgaria may have against her, in accordance with Article 261 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, and the corresponding Articles of the Treaties with Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.The Allied Powers, on the other hand, agree not to require from Turkey any payment in respect of claims so transferred.Article 9.No new concession shall be granted by the Turkish Government either to a subject of the Turkish State or otherwise without the consent of the Financial Corn-mission.Article 10.Powers to which Ottoman territory is ceded shall acquire without payment all property and possessions situated therein registered in the name of the Ottoman Empire and of the Civil list.Article 11.The High Contracting Parties agree that Powers to which Turkish territory is or has been ceded, by the&apos; arrangements concluded after the Balkan War or the present war, shall participate in the annual charge for the service of the Ottoman Public Debt contracted before the 1st November, 1914.The Governments of the States of the Balkan Penin-peninsula signatories to this Treaty to whom such territory has been or is so ceded agree to give adequate guarantees for the payment of. the share of the annual charges allotted to them, respectively.
For the purposes of this chapter, the Ottoman Public Debt shall be deemed to consist of the Debt heretofore governed by the Decree of Mouharrem, together with such other loans as are enumerated in the first Annex to this chapter.Loans contracted before the 1st November, 1914, will be taken into account in the distribution of the Ottoman Debt between Turkey, the States of the Balkan Peninsula, and the new States set up in Asia.The distribution among the States receiving territory shall be effected in the following manner: -(a.) Annuities arising from loans prior to the 17th October, 1912 (Balkan Wars), shall be dis-tributed between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan States receiving territory (in-cluding Albania).(b.) The residue of the annuities for which the Ottoman Empire remains liable after this dis-tribution, together with those arising from loans contracted by that Empire between the 17th October, 1912, and the 1st August, 1914, shall be distributed between the Ottoman Empire and the States to which territory will be ceded by the stipulations of the present Treatv of Peace.Article 13.The general principle to be followed in determining the amount of the annuity to be paid by each Power, to which Turkish territory is or has been ceded, is that the amount shall bear the same ratio to the total required for the service of the Debt as the average revenue of the ceded territory bore to the average revenue of the whole Empire (including in each case the yield of the Customs surtax imposed in the year 1907) over the three financial years 1909-10, 1910-11, and 1911-12.Article 14.The Financial Commission shall, as soon as may be after the ratification of this Treaty, determine in accord-ance with the principle mentioned in article 9 the amount of the annuities referred to in that article. The decisions of the Commission shall be communicated to the High Contracting Parties at the earliest date possible after the coming into effect of the present Treaty.The Financial Commission shall fulfil the functions provided for in article 134 of Treaty of Peace with Bul-Bulgaria.Article 15.The annuities assessed in the manner above provided will be payable as from the date of the ratification of the Treaties by which the various territories were ceded and, in the case of territories ceded under the present Treaty, from 1st March, 1920, and shall continue to be payable (except as provided below by Article 22) until the final liquidation of the Debt. They shaD, however, be proportionately reduced as the loans constituting the Debt are successively extinguished.

On each new creation of re-venue or of indirect taxes approved by the Financial Commission, the latter shall consider the possibility of entrusting the administration thereof to the Council for the account of the Ottoman Govern-ment.*The administration of the Customs shall be under a Director-General appointed by and revocable by the Financial Commission and answerable to it. No change in the schedule of the Customs charges shall be made except with the approval of the Financial Commission.The Council of the Debt as above constituted shall remain in office until such date as the bondholders have given their consent to its fusion with the Financial Commissio7i; such consent shall be sought as soon aspossible, with a view to the fusion of the two bodiestaking place not later than the expiry of the presentterm of the Council.Article 17.The Commission has authority to propose, at a later date, the substitution for the pledges at present granted to bondholders in accordance with their contract or existing decrees, of other adequate pledges, or of a charge on the general revenues of the Ottoman Empire. The Allied Governments undertake to consider any proposals the Financial Commission might then have to make.-Article 18.-All property, movable and immovable, belonging to the Administration of the Ottoman Debt, wherever situate, shall remain integrally at .the disposal of that&apos; body.The Council of the Debt shall have power to apply the value of any realised property, for the purpose, of extraordinary amortisation either of the Unified Debt or of the Lots Turcs.
The Turkish Government agrees to transfer to the Financial Commission all its rights in the Reserve Funds and the Tripoli Indemnity Fund.Article 20.A sum equal to the arrears of any revenues heretofore affected to the service of the Ottoman Public Debt within the territories that remain subject to the Dominion of the Turkish State, which should have been but have not been paid to the Council of the Debt, shall (except where such territories have been in the military occupation of Allied forces, and for the time of such occupation), he accounted for and paid to the Council of the Debt by the Turkish Government as soon as in the opinion of the Financial Commission the financial condition of the country shall permit.Article 21.The Council of the Debt shall review all the transactions of the Council which have taken place during the war, and any disbursements made by the Council which are not in accordance with its powers and duties, as defined by the Decree of Mouharrem or otherwise before the war, shall be reimbursed to the Council of the Debt by the Turkish Government so soon as in the opinion of the Financial Commission such payment is possible. The Council shall have power to review any action on the part of the Council during the war, and to annul any obligation entered into by the Council which in its opinion is prejudicial to the interests of the bondholders, and which was not in accordance with its powers.Article 22.Any of the Powers who by this Treaty are to contribute to the annual charge for the service of the Ottoman Public Debt may, upon giving six months&apos; notice to the Council of the Debt, redeem such obligation by payment of a sum representing the value of such annuity capitalised at such rate of interest as may be agreed between the Power concerned and the Council of the Debt.The Council of the Debt shall not have power to require such redemption.Article 23.The sums in gold to be transferred to the Allied and Associated Powers by Germany and Austria under the provisions of Article 259 il) and (2), and (4) and (7) of the Treaty with Germany, and under Article 210 (1) of the Treaty with Austria, shall be placed at the disposal of the Financial Commission.Article 24.The sums to be transferred by Germany in accordance with Article 259 (3) of the Treaty of. Versailles, shall be placed forthwith at the disposal of the Administration of the Debt.
The Ottoman Government undertakes to accept any decision that may be taken by the Allied Powers in agreement when necessary with other Powers regarding the funds of the Ottoman Sanitary Adminis-tration and the former Conseil superieur de Sante and in respect of the claim, of the Conseil superieur de Santi against the Turkish Government, as well as regarding the funds of the Lifeboat Service of the Black Sea and Bosphorus.The Allied Powers hereby give authority to the Financial Commission to represent them in this matter.Article 26.The Turkish Government agrees with the Allied Powers that the German Government is hereby released from the obligation incurred by the latter Government during the war to accept Turkish Government currency notes at a specified rate of exchange in payment for goods to be exported to Turkey.from Germany after the war.Article 27.The High Contracting Parties agree that, so soon as their claims against the Turkish G overnment as estab-lished in this chapter of this Treaty have been satisfied, and the pre-War Debt of the Ottoman Empire has been liquidated, the Financial Commission shall determine. The Turkish Government shall then consider in con-sultation with the Council of the League of Nations whether anv further administrative advice and assistance should in the interests of Turkey be provided for the Turkish Government by the Powers, members of the League of Nations, and, if so, in what form such advice and assistance shall be given.Article 28.The legislative measures required in order to give effect to the provisions of this chapter will be enacted by the Turkish Government and by the Powers concerned within six months from the date of the signature of this Treaty.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, March 27, 1920.

Turkey now possesses a paper currency in place of a pre-war gold currency. At present rates of exchange the   T. paper no longer represents the pre-war ratio of the   T, gold to the currency in which the ioans were subscribed, and in which the interest and the amortisation payments have to be paid in Europe according to the contract terms of the loans. (See Article 1 of the &quot;Decret-Annexe &quot; of September 1903 and Loan Contracts, passim.) The definition of  T. gold in these columns does not signify that the provisions for the coupons and sinking funds are to be made in gold, but that the figure in  T. has to be calculated according to such rate of exchange as will enable the bondholder to be paid in the currency to which he is entitled.
i851. The Commission shall establish its-own rules and procedure. The annual Chairman shall be in turn the French and British and Italian Delegate.

Turkey undertakes to grant to the members, officers and agents of the Commission full powers to visit and inspect at all reasonable times any place, public works, or undertakings in Turkey, and to furnish to the said Commission all records, documents and information which it may require.3. The Commission shall be entitled to assume, in agreement with the Turkish Government and independently of any default of the latter in fulfilling its obligations, the control, management and collection of all indirect taxes.4. No member of the Commission shall be responsible, except to the Government appointing him, for. any action or omission in the performance of his duties. No one of the Allied Governments assumes any responsibility in respect of any other Government.5.
