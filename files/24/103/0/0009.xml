The advance of wages offered by the Government will reaot very seriously on the whole industrial position.Labour is not stable:   apart from the Miners, the Railwaymen and Tramwaymen are talking of a strike and the workers in nearly every industry are demanding increased wages.   Great mischief is reported to hate been done by the statement in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; that the Government intended to blockade the Coal,Miners and had troops ready for the purpose.   The statement was promptly denied in the House of Commons, but men are saying, &quot;The Government dare not go into Court; they would be shown up.&quot;Outdoor meetings will shortly begin, but there appears to be a reaction against extremist speakers in Hyde Park and elsewhere.it important conferences will be held at Easter and the Independent Labour Party may be committed to a more extreme policy as a result.The Transport Workers1 Federation has sent  1,000 to the Dutch Workers on strike and has refused to handle tho cargo of Dutch ships.There is a crisis in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; offices:   the staff is demanding higher wages and the contributors wish to sign their articles, like the Editor-in-chief.   Mr. Lansbury told the Soviet Government that his present losses are 51,000 a week and that they were increasing with the rise in the cost of paper.A rising of tho Sinn Fe inert? in England and Scotland is unlikely.   There aro reports of an intention to carry murder into this country, but they aro not confirmed.
tPHB COAL MIHSRSThe negotiations between the Government and the miners have been fully reported in the Press; ft &quot;ballot is to &quot;bo taken on the final offer and returned by April 14th.  A general strike seems less likely than was the oaso when the first offer was made, hut the possibility of a strike in South Wales must not he ignored.   Some thousands of miners are striking at present in South Wales and Northumberland for trivial grievances and there la a general atmosphere of tension.  At the same time, the funds of the various associations are so depleted that an extended strike would entail considerable hardship; the Easter holidays will also have a sobering effect, as the men will spend most of their money.It is probable also that the Bookers&apos; Interim Report will steady the miners, in that it will give them mere confidence in negotiation.RA HWAYMBN   &apos;The Southern Federation of District Councils of the National Union of Eailwaymen, of whioh W.T.A. Foot is the moving spirit, has been considering strike machinery.   It wants to have a Central Strike Committee in constant session in London, with four Sub-Centres situated at Croydon, Eaton, Chatham and Wimbledon; other Sub-Centres are to he set up to cover the whole area not more than fifteen miles apart.   In the event of &quot;the necessity arising&quot; the Secretary shall set the machinery going and secure not less than five motors for communication and transport.  Ihe first issue of leaflets shall he sent to the Branches while the train service is still running. Indoor meetings are to he held for women only.When these proposals were discussed it was explainedthat/
that during the railway strike in September the Tube and Metropolitan Railways were not picketed and men contrived to get in bj? back doors; in future pickets will be provided for all entrances, for it is reoognised that speedy and efficient picketing is the essential factor in a successful strike. ......    ^      - . ^   .. /Groat difficulty was experienced In housing the Strike - Committee last September and consequently they had to accept hospitality from the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;.   Therefore the Rw,ilwayraen are now looking for a house in the Unity House district, which will be a residence for Mr, Poot and provide two big rooms for the use of the Strike Committee when required.  Meanwhile the Branches are. being Urged to form their own Strike Committees and prepare lists of cyeli and motorists.PROFITEERING&quot;Socialist War Points - The Best Jobberies of theWeek&quot; are the headings,of an article in the current numberof the forward&quot; dealing v/ith high prices.   The effect maybe judged from the following extracts4. &quot;Home butter, highest price under control -2/8 per lb. &quot;Home butter now decontrolled -5/6 per lb.linseed oake, highest controlled price,  19   , 15/- per ton.  Since decontrol,  25; per ton.Coffee, highest controlled price, 1/6 per lb.   Since decontrol, 2/  per lb.Under control, barley was 67/-- per.quarter. A month after decontrol it was 95/Z per quarter.Veal under control xms 10^d. per lb.  A month after decontrol it was 3/- per lb.&quot;HP MIIMM.M&quot;Wool profits pre-war - Id. per lb., Wool profits to-clay - 13d. to 43d..per lb.&quot;
&quot;Shipping freights to River Plate in 1914 -11/-.   To-day, 140/-,Shipping freights under Government control were 107/-; under decontrol they rose to 170/-.&quot;&quot;Do you know, Mrs. Housewife and Mr. Worker, that the Ministry of Munitions is holding up  600,000,000 worth of food, toxtiles, leather, timber furniture, pottery, tools and machinery?And it wonft p^aoe these goods quickly upon the market lest it reduce prices and Capitalist profits.&quot;&quot;The Call&quot; deals with the same subject in &quot;The Powder Magazine of Rising Prices&quot; and says:-&quot;Two main staples of food are to he again increased:   sugar at onoe by Ed. a lb., and breaa in a few days hence......It will not surprise us at any moment if this matter of food and price3 leads to an explosion that will end profiteering once and for all.   Beneath the apparently calm surface, a powder-magazine ia preparing.   The governing class are sitting on the safely valve.   They have made their preparations for suppressing any outbreak on the part of the exasperated working olass, hut happenings in other lands show that when the workers mean business they are like an avalanche that sweeps all before it. Every increase in prices is a challenge to the whole working class:   they will pick up the gage - one day.THE CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENTIn view of Mr. Lansbury!s recent statement that Co-operation is Communism put into practice; interest attaches to a leaflet which is being extensively circulated by the Co-operative Wholesale Society.   It is entitled, &quot;Towards the Commonwealth&quot; and states, &quot;Capital is the motive power necessary to the achievement of the practical work of Co-operation..Without capital w* cannot obtain our own fields for the production of raw materials, acquire our own factories, have our own warehouses and offices necessary to distribution, secure our own means of transport......Past experience has proved that as long as capital remains tied up in the hands of a few people the massob suffer all kinds of wrongs.   The remedy is for the WORKERS TO BECOME THEIROWN/
OYW CAPITALISTS........To raise capital and control it on sound Co-operative lines provides the safest and most effeotive way of changing the existing order of production and distribution, of trade and commerce11, so the oiroular urges all workers to take up Co-operative Wholesale Society BondsoTRADE VHIOHS AND EXTREMISTSThe distrust of recognised Trade Union leaders whioh extremists all over the oountry are oontinually trying to foster amongst the rank and file, is shown by Harry Pollitt in the &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought11 of March 87th.   In an article entitled &quot;She Autocracy of the Boilermakers&quot; he declares that;&quot;The whole Trade Union machinery is infinitely more cumbersome and reactionary than the Parliamentary procedure at Westminster, and It Is high time that the Left Wing comrades considered whether it would not be better to attack the existing system from the inside than to leave the reactionary Trade Union leaders a ffree hand.&quot;&quot;$hat is typical of the Boilermakers, Se typical of nearly every big Union in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation.   The question then arises, Jiow can this be altered?  I want to suggest that the time has arrived when Vigilance Committees should be formed in each district by the rebel members, of Trade Unions.   They could formulate a common policy, expound this policy at their branches, and would thus secure a far greater effect than could be got by different members proposing different policies in branches of the same Union.&quot;On March 24tb Pollitt told a Herald league meeting at East Ham that he thought there were sufficient men in the Army and flavy to counteract and win over the remainder for a revolution, whioh would oome suddenly; the revolution would start not in London but in the Northo   He also stated that the Shop Stewards movement had been smashed ly methods whioh he did not think it politic to divulge, but that it was by no means dead.THE/
m   5   -THE IABOUB PARTYTho following resolution has been forwarded by the birmingham Central Labour Party to the National executive of the Labour Party for consideration by the annual conference at Scarborough on June 32nd:-&quot;That this conferenoe heroby instructs the National Labour Party executive to take the opinion of all affiliated organisations upon the desirability of creating a large fighting fund for Parliamentary contests.  For this purpose all funds for candidates be pooled, including&apos;those of affiliated bodies and individual donations, to the National Party and to be under the control of the National Kxeoutive,  All candidates must have at least a twelve months1 Party membership, and be eligible for a candidature apart from financial considerations either personal or by any organisation.   List of such candidates to be issued to local Labour Parties-, whioh shall have free ohoice in selection, apart from candidates&quot; . organisations.  After selection by the&apos; Labour Party in the constituency and endorsement by National Executive, a sum proportionate to the size of the constituency shall be ear-marked from the pool for such approved candidature,&quot;TEE KING*S VISIT TO THE NORTHHis Majesty was present at the Grand National on Friday last.   The crowd was larger than has ever been recorded and its spontaneous and enthusiastic welcome was very remarkable.  On Saturday His Majesty visited the Ministry of Labour Training Centre at the City Hall and the Ministry of Pensions Hospital at Grangethorpe and in the afternoon witnessed the viotory of the Manchester team over Liverpool on the Manchester City Football Ground,   The crowd . numbered 35,000 people and nothing could have been more impressive than their wolcome,The interest taken by the Zing in a game which is nearer the heart of the people of the North--than any politioal question has done immense good,EASTER/
EASIER CONFERENCESThe Easter week-end will be the occasion of several Labour conferences:   the Independent Labour Party will meet at Glasgow on April 3rd, 4th and 5th; the National Union of Ex-Service Men will meet at Birmingham on the same days, and the British Socialist Party in London on April 4th and 5th.As already indicated in these reports, the main issue at Glasgow will be the question of affiliation with the Third (Moscow) International;.with this question is bound up that of the relations between the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Party.   In this connection it is reported that Saklatvala, who is exceptionally active, has received  50 from Theodor Rothstein, Leninfs Agent, to force a change in the Executive of the Independent Labour Party,   The Executive is said to be distressed by the number of rebels in the Party ranks.The agenda for the british Socialist Party Conference are frankly revolutionary; a resolution in the name of the Executive Committee asks the conference to reiterate &quot;its adhesion to the Communist platform&quot; and declares that &quot;the time has arrived for the abolition of the capitalist ordeir of sooiety and the establishment of the Communist Commonwealth.&quot;Albert Inkpin and George Deer, who went, as British Socialist Party delegates to the Strasbourg Conference, are reported to be in Germany  and to have the intention of going on to Russia.The Conference of the National Union of Ex-Service Men will probably devote most of its time to the scheme for &quot;back pay&quot;. MAT/
An innovation haB been made for the May Day meeting at the Albert Hall on May 1st:  a charge of Is. 3d. will be made for admission to all seats other than the gallery.   The three pence represent the &quot;amusement&quot; tax.A comprehensive resolution will be moved from the various platforms in Hyde Park; it covers housing and slums, transport, amnesty for all military prisoners, employment, endowment of motherhood, equal pay for men and women, universal pensions, abolition of the Aliens Restriction Act, state support and control of the blind, high prices and oontrol, recognition and support of the co-operative movement, withdrawal of troops from Ireland, the &quot;atroolties of capitalist governments everywhere&quot;, solidarity of the workerB of all countries and affiliation to the Third International and peace with Soviet Russia.Coventry has secured the services of five extremists &apos; to speak at the May Day demonstrations&apos;; they are Arthur McManus, W. Mellor of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, Skene McKay, defeated Socialist candidate for Harapstead at the last General Election, W, McKinder, who has been trying,to expose profiteering in wool, and R*C* Wallhead of the Independent Labour Party.,   It is reported that a general holiday will he taken by all organised workers; a flag day is being arranged to raise funds for the construction of a4new Trades Hall.Mr, John $ill. General Secretary of the Boilermakers, is urging all the Tyneside workers to take a general holiday and a demonstration is being arranged at Newcastle.YORKSHIREMy correspondent sends the following satisfactory report on the Yorkshire area:-MAY DAY CELEBRATIONS
&quot;I have been around the numerous centres during the week but except for the usual small cliques of the faithful at the Independent Labour Party and other branoh olubs, there have been no meetings.&quot;&quot;Most of the branches are having social functions to end the indoor season and get ready for outdoor propaganda during the summer.   As an example of how dead matters in the revolutionary camp are, I had pro( on the afternoon of the 27th when I had a long conversation with the editor of the local Labour papexj at Leeds.   He confessed to me that things were absolutely dead in Yorkshire, and it wanted an earth-quake to shift them.   He told me that it is with great difficulty that matter for the paper can now be gathered.   The old anti-war stuff is worked out; people have been so inured to loss of life, catastrophic happenings, etc., that they are imperviotf to agitation re the horrors being perpetrated in Hungary and the state of Central Europe generally, andl the definite blow to any revolutionary action by the Trade Union Congress after all the promises made all last outdoor season and up till now at the indoor gatherings, have caused a feeling of not in our time&apos; even amongst the erstwhile enthusiasts.&quot;Confirmation of this report has been received fromSheffield, where it was announced on March 21st that the weekly meetings in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers&apos;Institute, which have been the centre of revolutionaryagitation in the city, will cease owing to lack of funds.GLASGOW TOWN council the meetings of the Glasgow Town Council have for some time been characterised by great disorder.   The Labour element is turbulent and does not attempt to work with its opponents, and on more than one occasion Councillors Shinwell and Zirkwood have been suspended.   In the case of the former, this occurred again on March 24th, when Shinwell ordered to leave the chamber, shouted, &quot;These capitalist hooligans, supported by the lawyer fraternity, are adopting tactics of the boomerang type.   The day is coming when, whether by direct action or other action, you will got it in the neck.   We will have none of your middle class ideas. You have battened on us long enough.&quot;  On his departure     ij Kirkwood rose and addressed his colleagues as &quot;wolves and tigers.&quot; THE/- n
fTHE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;As stated in this report last week, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; published on March  5th an exceedingly mischievous article entitled &quot;Government Plot to Blockade Mining Villages&quot;.The effect on Labour of the article, which was followed up the next day, cannot possibly be exaggeratedand incalculable harm has already been done.   I quote thereport of a well informed correspondent who is at presentin South Wales:&quot;I have been making very full enquiries regarding the effect of the 1 Herald&apos;s1 articles on a blockade&apos; of minors in the event of a strike and in my opinion it is hardly possible to convey in writing to any one out of the area the real harm they have done and the ugly temper they have raised, particularly the article of March 86th whioh repeats and attempts to confirm what was said on March 25th.   I found the men scrambling more or less for the paper this morning on the first shift and at the second and it was obvious that special efforts had been made to get this paper to the pits early.&quot;The remarks I heard generally were. &apos; The &apos;Heraldf dare not say this if it was not true&apos;.   &apos;The Government can only deny it in Parliament but dare not go into court, they would be shown up.1&quot;Meanwhile all is not well with the Staff of the&quot;Herald&quot;.   The superior members are discontented at notbeing allowed to sign their articles as Mr. Lansbury doesand find Mr. Lanebury very difficult to work with, whilethe subordinates are demanding higher pay.   There isabsolute efidenoo that in Moscow Mr. Lansbury told theSoviet Government that the paper is losing  1,000 a wee*.and that the loss would be greater as the cost of paperrose.   He did not want to accept a money subsidy but he wanted paper for which he said he would pay a smallcommission on the understanding that .he would pay off hisdebt gradually.   On thiB Frederick Strflm was instructed tosupply him with 500 tons valued at present rates at  25,000.Under/
Under this disingenuous arrangement, he was able to deny that he had received &quot;an ounce of paper,&quot;SINK gBIH IN GREAT BRITAINIt is reported that a conference of branches of the Irish Labour Party of Great Britain is to be held at Gateshoad on April 11th; invitations aro being issued by Councillor Kyan, of that town, who is supporting the Iris] opponents of McLoughlin in Glasgow.As the result of the exposure of a possible rising on April 5th, a special meeting of the Scottish Sinn Fein Executive was held at Glasgow on March 24th.   About 60 delegates were present and a resolution was proposed to th! effect that &quot;tho Irish Volunteers in Scotland proceed to Ireland as originally arranged on receipt of orders from headquarters.&quot;   An amendment urged that as the authorities were now on the alert the present time was inopportune for departure.   This amendment was carried by 30 votes to 25. My correspondent, adds that the Volunteers do not relish active service in Scotland, though ready and willing to fight in Ireland.In South ftaies the Irish Self-Detcrmination League is not making very great headway., although a new branch may shortly, be formed at Aber Bargoed.Mr. Sears, 1*1.P.; has returned to the Lancashire distri and addressed a meeting of about 600 people at Oldham on March 22nd.   Mrs. Sheeny Skeffington, Mrs. Connolly and Mr. Sean Maclntee, M.P., also spoke.   Mrs. Skeffington advocated &quot;guerilla warfare&quot; in preference to a rising in Ireland and in thiB country.   The meeting was held under the auspices of , tha Irish Self-Determination League.The various Ir,ish Clubs in the Leeds district are much concerned about the arrest of William 0*Brlen of the IrishTransport/
Transport Workers and at the meetings held instructions hare heen issued to send resolutions of protest to local M.Ps. and the Labour Party.The &quot;Workers1 Dreadnought&quot; has advocated the formation of an Irish Communist Party, but the secretary of the Cork branch of the Irish Socialist Party replies in the current issue. &quot;The Irish people are a^t war with England and the whole energies of the race, regardless of class, will be thrown into the struggle.&quot;   Sean MoLoughlin, on the other hand, states that an Irish Communist Party has been formed, with the object of establishing a &quot;Workers1 Republic.&quot;There are many reports current of an intention of extending the policy of secret murder to England, hut though precautions are being&apos; taken there is at present no evidence to support this.   There are also reports that American and Australian deserters are employed in the execution of the murders, but all the evidence so far is conclusive that the murderers are - Irish.IRELAND&apos; *There is no outward change for the better in thegeneral situation; the number of outrages which havetaken place during the week is still very high and thepolicy of attempting to intimidate the police byassassination is being continued.   There are, however,one or two points which deserve attention:- .1.   --Reports show that the extremist leaders realise that the Government is resolved on stamping out the armed forces of rebellion.2. * Attempts are being made by the rebels to ^strengthen the idea in the country that Ireland is at war with England by pretending that.the armed bands of ruffians that are at present committing outrages are patriots carrying on guerilla warfare against an Army of Occupation.With/
With regard to 1,, the arrest of many of the most dangerous members of the Irish Volunteers is having its natural result of disorganising the system and discouraging the faint-hearted; the knowledge that the extremist, leaders are gradually, hut inexorably, being rounded up and deporte and the fact tiut the necessary information forchis end is being obtained by the authorities in spite of all efforts at intimidation, are beginning to tell. The result is that the extremists are forced to devise fresh methods of outrage and revolt or lose the allegiance of their adherents. In this connection numerous reports are being received of arrangement being made for simultaneous attacks on police baaracks, or even of a rising. Nothing definite, however, appears to hav been decided yet.With regard to 2., an order was recently issued in &quot;An toglaoh&quot; (the official publication of the Irish Volunteei that In future no raids for arms should be made on private houses without express permission from Irish Volunteers G.H4 Apparently the Sinn Fein Executive have found that such raids are having a bad effect in the country and are likely to lead to murders such as occurred lately in Wexford; they hav? therefore, attempted to prevent such raids and in their place organise systematic raids on police barracks, thus hoping to strengthen the feeling mentioned in,point 2.During the past week 40 rebels have been arrested as be Implicated in outrages or connected with the Irish Republican Army.&apos;    1 - .Mr, S. K, Ratoliffe, who has recently returned from a lecturing tour in America, speaking at a Fabian Society Meeting on Friday, said do Valera did not create a great impression in America - not nearly,so much as Sir Horace Plunket did - nevertheless the idea of an Irish Republic appeals to the American mind, and the number of public andoivic/
civic functions given to tho Irish Republican leader in America was astounding.   The speaker reminded the audience that it is futile to try and hide the hard facts that America is getting sour against Great Britain over the Irish and other questions and that the American people have taken offence over the drawing up of the Paris Peace Treaty.Be Valera has lately lost ground in favour of the extremists Cohalan and Devoy and he will probably soon i-etum to Ireland.It has now transpired that the Constitution of the Irish Bepublioan Brotherhood, a very well drawn document, has Just come into our hands.   It shows that the organisation consists of an inner and an outer body.   The inner appears to carry out murders and executions:   the outer &quot;military&quot; operations such as attacks on police barracks.   Officers of the outer body belong to the inner, whose proceedings are unknown to the great body of the Volunteers who are believed to number 110,000.
