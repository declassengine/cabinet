This document is the property oi His Britannic Majestys Government.THE CABINET.TRAVELLING   CONCESSIONS FOR RELATIVES VISITING GRAVES OF THE FALLEN IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.With reference to the request for travelling concessions for relatives to visit graves in France and Belgium recently put forward by a deputation from the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers and the Comrades of the Great War, received on 6th February by the Prime Minister, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on the financial consequences and on the serious administrative difficulties which such concessions would inevitably entail.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.The War Office,12th April, 1920.1. The French Railway Companies, at the request of the French Government, have agreed to grant a reduction of 50 per cent, on railway fares to relatives visiting the graves of fallen French soldiers.2. A request for similar travelling concessions for those relatives of fallen British officers and men who wish to visit their graves in France and Belgium was referred in March, 1919, by the British Government to the Railway Executive Committee, who replied that they were unable to meet the request. There is evidence that this decision caused great disappointment to the relatives concerned, and it is anticipated that pressure will be brought to extend to relatives of fallen soldiers in this country travelling facilities similar to those now in operation in France. It will be remembered that this was one of the questions specially raised by a deputation from the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers and the Comrades of the Great War, which was received by the Prime Minister on 6th February. Prior to the reception of the deputation, however, the question was discussed at a Cabinet Conference, when it was agreed that, while the present time was premature for arranging visits of this kind, it might be possible to grant facilities later.3. A concession which has been suggested is that a reduction of 50 per cent, on the third class fare from the relatives&apos;&quot; home to the port of landing and return be granted to two near relatives (parent, wife, child, brother, sister) of an officer or soldier buried in France or Belgium. This is to apply also to members of the various Dominions and Colonies in respect of the journey from England to the port of landing in France and back, should they visit this country en route.4. In considering the question of making such concession, however, the following points should be observed : (i.) The British proposal differs from the French practice in that the former contemplates that Army votes should defray half the cost of transportation, whereas in France the Government pays nothing.(ii.) Assuming that there are half a million graves in France and Flanders, and that 40 per cent, of the relatives concerned take advantage of the concession, it is estimated that the additional charge to Army Funds will be 500,000/. for travelling only.(B20/117)   100  4/20   H&amp;S  7983 wo
(iii.) In order to ensure that only those properly entitled should have the benefits of the concession, an expensive and elaborate machinery would have to be set up to verify claims, with some form of local identification of applicants, and a register in a central office to see that the grave actually existed and that it had not already been visited. Without a system of control, many would abuse the concession in order to obtain a cheap trip to France.(iv.) The War Department would find it difficult to refuse to safeguard the interests of the relatives when travelling in a strange country whose language they do not speak, and, in order to control their movement, a complete machinery may have to be created in France, analogous to but largely more complicated than that devised for the movement of reinforcements to the field armies. Embarkation staffs, railway transport officers, reception hostels at ports and railheads in France, together with Administrative Staffs to control the operation of this organization would all be necessary. The establishment of such machinery would materially delay the military evacuation of France, and would, including the cost of the actual transportation, involve an expenditure of 2,000,000?.(v.) It would be difficult to refuse similar concessions to relatives desirous of visiting graves in Salonika, Mesopotamia, Egypt, &amp;c.
