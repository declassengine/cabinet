^r1^^^ JThle. Document Is the Property of &apos;[- .127lnn    V u        His Bri&quot;&apos;:britannic MajeoVs Government.T circulate to my.colleagues copies of telegrams which have recently been received from the Government of India.E.S..M. -8th April 1920,From Viceroy, Home Department, 25th March 1.920.The hartal on 19th March passed off quietly.   As far as our reports go, which are still incomplete, the Hindus participated to a large extent.   Hartal was orderly. Shops in Delhi and elsewhere opened in evening.   Traffic not generally stopped. Government servants did not remain away from work.   Day observed as fast by Mohamedans and public meetings held in evening in important cities, fiery speeches though less fiery than might have been expected being delivered and resolutions passed.   Calcutta resolution of continuance of disloyalty not everywhere accepted, e.g., Patna.   Success of hartal due to personal efforts of leaders, but signs becoming manifest that violence of Calcutta resolutions causing some alarm to Mohamedans ,.in other provinces, Punjab, United Provinces (except Abdul Bari&apos;s clique), Bihar and Orissa and especially Bombay.   In Bombay proposed boycott of British goods is disliked by local Mohamedans on commercial grounds, presence of Aga Khan also has steadying effect.   Gandhi is opposed to boycott.   Extremist Hindus under Tilak have held aloof.   In United Provinces violence in Upper India and elsewhere has produced counter manifesto from Shia Mujtahids of Lucknow denouncing Khilafat agitation for importing  considerations of temporal power into purely religious question since according to Shias Sultan of Hum and Shah of Persia are. neither Khalifas (successors) of the prophet nor religious leaders.   At the same time Extremists very active, Shaukat Ali in particular urging Mohamedans in Government service to leave it and Abdul Bari preaching Jehad.    Prime Ministers reply.to Khilafat deputation being published.    We have just received secret report of important meeting held at Delhi on 22nd March, attended by among others following Hindus : Lajpat Rai, Gandhi, Malaviya, Patel, Tilak, Khaparde; also following Mohamedans: Ajmal Khan, Dr. Ansari, Abdul Kalam Azad, Abdul Bari, Kiclwai, Shaukat Ali, Nawab of Dacca.   Object of meeting was to consider how the Calcutta Khilafat resolutions should be followed up in the event of Turkish peace terms not being settled to satisfaction of Indian Mussalraans.   It was decided to begin with pushing of Swadeshi movement.   Gandhi next explained plan of non-co-operation,; including resignation of Government titles and honorary offices, to be followed by resignation of service by Government and domestic servants and later by boycott of army and refusal to pay taxes.   Abdul Bari said Mohamedans could not wait for this and must go in at once for Jehad and Hijrat.   Abdul Kalam Azacl said that time was not ripe for Jehad and Hijrafc was impossible.   Lajpat Rai suggested immediate, beginning of boycott movement and inducing Mussulmans leave service of Govern-ment and private service of Europeans.   Progressive steps suggested by Gandhi generally accepted, and a committee consisting of Gandhi, Lajpat Rai, Ajmal Khan, Shaukat Ali, and Abdul Kalam appointed to draw up scheme of complete programme in the.event of minimum of Moslems not being accepted.   This will be signed by. all-leaders while Lajpat Rai and Abdul Kalam will supervise its being put into practice.2. Some evidence that union of pan-Islam ism and Bolshevism, an accomplished fact in Central Asia, has its counterpart in India. Existence in India of Bolshevism emissaries not open to doubt, and sympathy in some Moslem circles with Bolshevism evidenced by proposed resolution at Bombay-Khilafat conference that it was not in the interests of Mahomedans to oppose Bolshevism in India or in any part of Asia. Resolution disallowed but most of delegates reported to have favoured employment of Bolshevism as weapon against British. Labour unrest favourable to.propagation of extremism.   Government servants also being affected.From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 30th March 1920.350 S. Secret. Khilafat agitation. Letter from Begam of Bhopal, dated 15th March, represents that assurances given by responsible ministers were understood to :mean that Ottoman Empire was in no danger of dismemberment, and that dignity1 of Sultan as religious head of Islam would not be impaired, and protests against the present agitation in England as to future of Constantinople and cognate questions.   She10  1250     100 4.20
apprehends that dismemberment of Turkey may lead to proclamation of Jehad, and urges lenient treatment of Turk. Temporal power, she says, has always been regarded as necessary qualification of Khilafat. Nizam of Hyderabad writes in similar terms, dated .16th March, urging that any departure from strict observance of promises made during the war will-be regarded as an outrage.Copies of these letters, which were written before publication of proceedings of recent interview between Prime Minister and Indian Khilafat deputation, follow by this wreek&apos;s mail.From Viceroy, Rome Department, 31st March 1020.Following is weekly telegram. The Mohamedans who took part in secret conference at Delhi reported last week proceeded, at once after conference to Meerut to the third sitting of provincial Khilafat Conference. Gandhi announced Delhi leaders&apos; plan of action in case of unfavourable Turkish settlement consisting of three steps: first, renouncing Government titles and civil employments; (2) renouncing military and police employment; (3) refusal payment of taxes and Government dues. At present, however, movement not apparently gaining strength. Press and public opinion concerned with two main events of the week: (.1) publication of Congress report of Punjab disturbances ; (2) Prime Ministers speech to Khilafat deputation. Former welcomed by Extremist Press as true statement of case moderately presented but Leader, Allahabad, points out its limitations in absence of anyone to represent, Government viewpoint, and of cross-examination of witnesses, and criticises Congress Committee for perfunctory examination of Satyagraha doctrine and its effect in producing the trouble that arose. Prime Ministers speech not well received except by English Press; described by Extremists as disappointing and even provoking, while Moderates have expressed their opinion that it will not satisfy Indian opinion.In continuation of our telegram of the 21st ultimo, and my weekly telegram of the 25th March.
