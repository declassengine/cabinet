TThis Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government. 271---------^----------- ,Restitution in Specie under the Treaties of Peace.V memorandum by the President of the Board of Tradem**w  M*W W*Vt*MMfl W MM - ** *W V** **. MMG^^rtiole 297 (f) of the Treaty of Peace with Germany provides that whorovor a national of an Allied or Associated Power is entitled to property which has been subjected to a measure of transfer in German territory and espressos a desire for its restitution, his claim for compensation in respect of damage due to the transfer shall be satisfied by the restitution of the property, if it still exists, in specie.   In ouch caso, Germany is to take all necessary steps to restore the evicted owner to the possession of his property free from all encumbrances and burdens with which it may hare been charged after the liquidation,&apos; and to indemnify all third parties injured by the restitution.Requests have boen received from some Important British concerns whoso Branch establishments in Gormany were transferred by the German Government that this paragraph should be applied for their benefit, failing which, tho German concerns which have taken over their Branch businesses will be In a very favourable position in competing with them in Germany with the aid of their plant and organisation and oven their trade marks,In certain oases in which the business has been transferred as a going concern, a rc*-transfer will not present groat difficult ties,   Tho Gorman Government are understood to bo in favour of handing back tho business in such a case in order to reduce the amount of pecuniary compensation payable to British nationals, an4 in one instance of an important concern, an arrangement of this nature has already been made voluntarily with the permission of the Board of Trade.   In other oases, however, restitution of businesses which have boon liquidated, or property which has been sold, would be a matter of tho greatest difficulty and complication.   The Treaty, however, ma&amp;os no distinction between classes of case provided that restitution is actually possible, and it would not be possible for His Majesty1s Government while preferring tho applications of some British nationals to refuse to put forward
those of other British subjects.The insertion in the Treaty of the provision in question was proposed at the Peace Conference by the French Delegation and was I accepted by tho British representatives having regard to the fact that in France liquidation of German property had not been resorted to during tho war,     It was felt, however, that It would be unjustifiable to require the provisions for restitution in specie to be applied for the beneff.It of British nationals seeing that the liquidation of British property in Germany had only been adopted by the enemy in view of the measures taken by ourselves and followed closely the lines of those measures.    Paragraph (g) of Article 297, which reserves the right conferred by the previous paragraph to owners who vasre nationals of Allied or Associated Powers within whose territories legislative measures prescribing the general liquidation of enemy property were not applied before the armistice, was inserted for the express purpose of excluding this country from tho purview of paragraph (f),We are now advised by the Law Officers, that the legislation in the United Kingdom did not prescribe the general liquidation of enemy property within the meaning of paragraph (g), and that that paragraph does not in consequence serve as was intended to exclude British nationals from the benefit of paragraph (f).   The Law Officers state, however, that it is for His Majesty1s Government to decide whether the right of restitution provided for by paragraph (f) is to bo exercised, and that in the event of the Government deciding not to support the claims of British nationals for restitution In specie, there are no legal means by which British nationals can challenge this decision.-.I am of opinion that having regard to the fact that t he Treaty provisions were drafted with the clear intention of excluding British nationals from the benefit of restitution In specie, the Government should, decline to exercise the right which has in point of fact been conferred, and should leave the re-transfer of businesses where this is reasonably possible to be
arranged by voluntary agreement. The interested parties in this country, however, will not unnaturally, protest strongly against such a refusal to demand for them the restitution for which they have applied, and I should be glad to have the decision of the cabinet upon the matter.
