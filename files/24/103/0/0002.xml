I would point out, however, that it is impossible to move the 4,000 people at present in Regent1s Park to Acton where there is only accommodation for the 000 at present there, or, . indeed (so far as I am aware) to any other outlying part of London, and that it is obviously un-economical to keep 800 people separated from the main body of their Department when an adjustment affecting 200 staff belonging to another Department would bring the whole of my staff engaged on the actual issue of pensions under the same roof, leaving those employed on work closely connected with the actual issue, at Baker Street.. My object would not be met by transferring the Acton Staff to Baker Street and vice versa.L. WORTH INGTON - EVAN S. 31st March,, 1920.
