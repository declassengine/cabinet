CONFIDENTIAL W i^LJrThi3 Document is the Propel&apos; cf NA-^-^V)His Qr;,ji;-;.i. j Majesty^ Goverrnrieiic,Referred to Committee of Home Affairs^^J^S^^ IMPORTATION OF PLUMGg (PROHIBITION) BILL.-f Memorandum by tl.p President of the Board of trade^.I would refer to the memorandum which was submitted by my predecessor to the Home Affairs Committee and considered by the Committee on March 15th (CP. 852) with regard to the Plumage Bill introduced in the House of Lords by Lord Aberdeen. This Bill has passed rapidly through the House of Lords without amendment and the question,therefore, arises as to the attitude to be taken towards it by the Government when it reaches the House of Commons,     On the whole I am not prepared to recommend that it should be taken up as a Government measure in view of the length and importance of the Government&apos;s programme of legislation for this Session.     I am, however, disposed to suggest that as tho approval of the measure of the Government has been already announced in the House of Lords in pursuance of the decision of the Home Affairs Committee, it would be desirable if possible that some facilities should be given for * its passage through the Commons.    Unless some time can definite-ly be set apart for its consideration it will, I fear, have little chance of passing and we aro I think committed to doing what we can to help its promoters.Further consideration of the Bill has shown that oertain amendments will be required the principal of which is one designed to give effect to the wishes of the Customs, who have expressed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer their unwilllng-ness to be responsible for prosecution of persons found to be in possession of unlawfully imported plumage.     I propose to . communicate with the promoters of the Bill with a view to settling in concert with them, the terms of the amendments which rfhould be moved when the Bill is considered in Committee,R,S, HQRNE31st March, 1920.
