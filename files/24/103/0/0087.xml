General. Nil.Part II.-Departmental.Employment Exchanges : The Employment Position.The &quot;first quarter of 1920 has seen a marked recovery in the position as regards employ-ment, conditioned largely, it would appear, by the settlement of the strike among the iron moulders and the absence of any subsequent strikes on a large scale. The improvement, as indicated by the number of applicants for employment registered at the Employment Exchanges, has been very marked. On the 16th January over 592,000 persons were registered at the Exchanges. By the 1st April a steady decline had reduced the number to 359,000, a decrease of 233,000, or over 39 per cent. In this total, workers in the insured industries bear a rough proportion of one to two in the uninsured industries. The total may be taken as indicating for the. whole of the workers of the country an approximate unemployment rate of 2 per cent., as measured by the Exchange registers. A similar calculation for the middle of December, 1919, shows a rate of 3*4 per cent. There would appear to be good prospects, unless a recrudescence of labour unrest occurs, that this progressive improvement in the position will be maintained for some time to come.(c 1986^  150 4/20 h&amp;s 2 A
Throughout the first three months of the year the Employment Exchanges main-tained a steady average of platings, the limits being in round numbers 27,900 during the week ending the 9th January, and 22,300 during the week ending the 18th March.The decrease in unemployment has been mainly confined to men. The decline in the men&apos;s register during the latter months of 1919 was interrupted by the railway strike and the moulders&apos; strike which, by the 16th January, had nearly raised the live register for men to the same total as that at which it had .stood at the beginning of August, 1919. The actual total on the 16th January was a little over 510,700. By the 1st April it had fallen to a little less than 290,500, a decline of 220,000 or over 43 per cent. The number of women registered, on the other hand, which had been falling throughout the last quarter of 1919, and was little affected by the moulders&apos; strike, has for some time remained prac-tically constant. The total of women registered slightly exceeded 51,000 on the 16th January, and, after some slight oscillation during the interval in an upward direction, stood, on the 1st April, at a little over 47,000, a decline of only 8 per cent. The withdrawal of out-of-work donation for civilian women late in 1919 has produced a very small decline in the register, while the effect upon the,men&apos;s register, so far as it can be detected, seems to have been equally negligible. The registers of juvenile workers, both as regards boys and girls, have shown the oscillations which were to be expected in consequence of the school-leaving age having been fixed at definite periods, but, on the whole, have shown a tendency to decline slightly.The most unfortunate feature in the situation still remains the predominance of ex-Service men among the unemployed. Of 302,000 men registered on the 26th March, over 237,500, or roughly 78 per cent., were ex-Service men receiving out-of-work donation. Allowance must be made for the fact that the number for demobilised men is still increasing by a substantial figure each week. Between the 1st January and the 31st March over 217,000 men have been released from the Forces. It would seem, however, that if the rate of absorption is still being maintained, no very marked improvement has as yet taken place. On the other hand, in a very large proportion of cases, the period of unemployment of these men has as yet been comparatively short. Over 74 per cent, are still claiming donation under the original scheme, and have therefore not yet been unemployed for 56 days since their policies became available. The recent extension of the out-of-work dona-tion scheme to meet the case of unemployed ex-members of the Forces who have exhausted their present policies should, moreover, be of great value in tiding over the period of difficulty until the situation has improved sufficiently to enable their absorption into industry. This extension provides for ex-members of the Forces whose original policies expired on the 24th November, or who had at that or any later date exhausted their right to donation under the original scheme, or its extensions, a further grant of donation at the rate of 20s. a week for men and 15s, for women, to be drawn during a period not exceeding 12 weeks, and between the 1st April and the 30th July.Part III.-The Labour and Socialist Press.The Socialist Movement.The subject which attracts the greatest attention in the papers reviewed this week is the annual conference of the Independent Labour &quot;Party at Glasgow. It is a proof of the predominant importance of this party in English socialism that criticism of it and its leaders in the more extreme papers &quot; The Call &quot; and &quot; The Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot;  takes up greater space than, and is given precedence over, reports and appreciations of the British Socialist Party Conference which took place at the same time. The Socialist Labour Party also held a conference at Carlisle during the Easter week-end but its proceedings have not yet been disclosed.The I.L.P. papers themselves devote more attention to reporting the proceedings of the conference than to commenting upon its decisions. The &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in a leading article, expresses supreme statisfaction that the resolution in favour of immediate affiliation to the Third International was defeated ; had this resolution been passed, the official opinion of this paper is that the &quot; one clear glowing light of International Socialism would have been blotted out.&quot; Mr. ramsay Macdonald, in &quot; Forward,&quot; shows greater appreciation of the practical result of the decisions with regard to International affiliation. &quot; We have cut ourselves off from every international connection ; the Swiss conference is doubtful now; we must start afresh to start an international contact.&quot; More interesting, however, is the criticism upon the machinery of the conference made by
Mr. Macdonald and the &quot; Mertliyr Pioneer.&quot; Mr. Macdonald regrets that many delegates were sent to the conference instructed to vote in accordance with previous branch decisions without reference to the course of discussion at the Conference. &quot; The I.L.P. must not become a mere machine like the T.U.C.&quot; The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; however, criticises the unwieldy character of the conference, and thinks that the ultimate national gathering of the party should be confined to representatives from the divisional conferences. The practical meaning of these bomplaints is obvious. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald wishes to have a representative national assembly of the Party which will be guided in its decisions by the opinions of the national leaders. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; wishes to make the national conference a meeting of delegates, whose opinions will have been pre-determined by divisional conferences, in which the national leaders do not take part. Both Mr. Macdonald and the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; complain of the branches of the Party : Mr. Macdonald on the ground that they tend to arrive at decisions without full information and succumb too easily to the extremists ; the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; because they do not arrive at definite enough decisions on the questions at issue. &quot; Many branches divided their votes and cast them in mutually negating blocks.&quot;&quot; The Call &quot; and the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; are of course very critical of the I.L.P., but the only point worthy of special note is a criticism in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dread-nought &quot; of the extremists of the I.L.P. Mr. C. H. Norman stated at Glasgow that &quot; more favourable circumstances for the sudden establishment of the dictatorship of the pro-letariat never existed than at the time of the railway strike last year.&quot; This assertion the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; vigorously denies. &quot; The masses were by no means prepared to set up a dictatorship at any time last year ; there is a great deal of hard educational work to be done before we shall be ready for that.&quot;The Trade Union Movement.A noticeable feature of last week&apos;s Labour and Socialist Press was a concentration of discussion upon matters of trade union organisation. This feature, so far as the more extreme writers are concerned, may be connected with the decision of the Trade Union Congress against direct action in support of mines nationalisation. While the decision of the T.U.C. on this matter was still more or less open to doubt, these writers, on every possible occasion, contrasted the Labour Party with the T.U.C. always to the disadvantage of the former. Since this decision, which showed that from the extreme point of view, the T.U.C. was as bad as the Labour Party, criticism of the Labour Party has been forgotten and has given place to a series of appeals over the heads of trade union leaders to the trade union members who elect them. &quot; The Call,&quot; this week, urges all workers to down tools on 1st May in order to secure a Ml peace with Russia and diplomatic recog-nition of the Soviet Government. The workers are urged &quot; not to bother about their trade union leaders.&quot; The South Wales correspondent to the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought &quot; urges the miners to strike, on the ground that they are never likely again to have a better chance of ruining the industry. In this paper, a further instalment appears of the article on the National Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Union. This instalment is of no greater value than the previous one. The positive suggestions made are that the powers of branches should be increased and that the general meeting of the union should remove from office the present officials. The &quot; New Age &quot; is also joining in this movement; &quot; we would appeal to the rank and file of the producers and consumers of the country over the swollen heads of their over-paid leaders.&quot;Some comments upon recent wage movements and methods of negotiation occur in the&quot; New Statesman,&quot; &quot; Justice,&quot; the &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; and the &quot; Democrat.&quot; The &quot; New Statesman &quot; considers in a special article the majority report of the Court of Inquiry, under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, into the claim of the National Transport Workers&apos; Federation on behalf of dock employees. This paper believes that this report is a document of importance comparable to the reports of the Coal Industry Commission last year, and proceeds to discuss its effect on industrial peace. Only if employers are prepared to change the attitude they have hitherto maintained, and to recognise that the conditions of the workers must be fundamentally altered, does this paper think that such reports as these will make for peace. The principle must be recognised, thinks this paper, that &quot; the worker who belongs to an industry has a right to expect from that industry a constant maintenance, whether full and continuous employment can be provided for him or not.&quot; Rigorous application of this principle has, of course, been responsible for the hostility of this paper to the Unemployment Insurance Bill. With this somewhat academic criticism of the report of Lord Shaw&apos;s Court of Inquiry may be contrasted Mr. Bevin&apos;s appreciations of the method of the inquiry, as given to a representative of &quot; Justice.&quot;&apos;(0 1986) 2 A2
Mr. Bevin is sure that the new method of investigation is all to the good. He lays special stress on the daily publicity which can be given to the proceedings. &quot; The evidence is given in sufficiently easy stages for the men concerned to assimilate the facts.&quot; By this publicity/ too, &quot; the men come to understand the difficulties present in all negotiations for wage advances.&quot; In so far as industrial peace is disturbed by the difficulty trade union leaders have in keeping in touch with their members, and by the difficulty the men have in appre-ciating the technical processes of wage negotiations, an argument directly opposed to that of the &quot; New Statesman,&quot; may well be based on these opinions of Mr. Bevin.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; discusses the wage position in the cotton textile industry. It shows that in practice there is very little difference between the separate demands that have been put forward on behalf of cardroom workers, spinners and weavers ; and expresses the opinion that the operatives should have made a joint application. The cardroom workers are especially condemned for introducing into the matter the question of a new standard of wages. &quot; Negotiations with reference to a new standard will more conveniently be entered upon when no question of an advance or reduction is in being.&quot; The trade union correspondent of the &quot;Democrat&quot; refers to-the recent award of the Industrial Court with reference to wages in the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades.* He regards this award, quite erroneously, as meaning the adoption by the Court of the principle of &quot; payment by results &quot; and then proceeds to compare it with the preference shown by the Government in the negotiations with the miners for percentage advances on list prices over flat-rate advances. He concludes, therefore, that the Industrial Court, in the engineering award, was administering a policy laid down for it by the Government; and then proceeds to attack the Court. &quot; Members of the Court are now servants to the State, whose mandate they are expected to obey while in office ; the Court has ceased to be representative of employers and employed and has become a State organ.&quot; It has been noted in previous issues of this report that this writer, in his criticism of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Bill, frequently bases his arguments on entirely false foundations.Foreign Affairs.The events in Germany are noticed in many papers, but it is obvious that considerable difficulty has been met with by the Socialist and Labour Press in constructing attacks upon the Government. The &quot; Nation &quot; mitigates the &quot;redness &quot; of the Ruhr Valley, reproaches our Government for its rumoured responsibility for the provision of the Peace Treaty which allows Germany only a small &quot; professional army,&quot; and suggests that had the French government occupied the Ruhr Valley, its operations would have been more intelligible. This paper is still in ignorance of the situation of the various armies of occupation on the Rhine. The &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; which is always more optimistic in Foreign than in Home Affairs, believes that in the Ruhr Valley there has been a genuine nascent communist republic of the Moscow type. This paper assumes that the English, French and German Governments are all in alliance against this workers&apos; movementf and somewhat hysterically appeals to Allied workers not to allow this imagined conspiracy to succeed.Other.It is so very rarely that writers to the Socialist and Labour Press show intimate knowledge of Government publications, that it is worthy of note that the &quot;British Citizen,&quot; in an attack upon the London traffic combine, makes considerable use of the report of the Director-General, Finance Department, Ministry of Transport on the Underground Electric Railway Companies, which was published as an appendix to the Report of the Ministry of Transport Advisory Committee on London Transport.! The conclusion of this paper is that a most searching inquiry should be made before the London Electric Railway Companies (Fares, &amp;c.) Bill be passed into law.The fact that some of the greater ship-owning companies are, in some cases, proposing to build oil-burning ships, and, in others, proposing to convert into oil consumers ships built for coal fuel, appears to have attracted some attention in both mining and shipping circles in the Labour world. This possible reduction in the demand for coal is used in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; as an -argument in favour of the proposition that the miners must strike now or never. The same fact has been used by the Seafarers&apos; Joint Council to controvert the argument that a 48-hour week on board ship is impossible because of lack of seamen and lack of accommodation.* Award No. 180 of. this Report p. 183.f Miss Sylvia Pankhurst arrives at this conclusion more readily because of a failure to use a map of Germany in preparing her article. J Cmd. 636.
Part IV. General Topics.The General Situation.The general labour situation is again unsettled, owing to the large number of wage demands in important industries which are under consideration. The London District Council of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives is reported to have made a demand for new rates of 3s. per hour for skilled operatives and 2s. Qd. for labourers, which would involve increases of about  2 per week over present rates. The N.U.R. has lodged a demand which will be considered by the Central Wages Board for an all-round advance of  1 per week for conciliation grades. The tramwaymen, after sectional strikes, are reiterating their original demand for a national increase of 10s. per week, and the matter is at present being discussed by the Joint Industrial Council. Negotiations are continuing on the demand of the bakers for a national increase of 15s. per week. Postal workers held a meeting at the Albert Hall in support of their claim for an advance of 10s. per week. The Workers&apos; Union has demanded a minimum wage of  4 per week for municipal employees in London. Many other classes of workers are also demanding large increases.The general unsettlement is increased by events in Europe and in Ireland. The development of the general strike in Germany and the subsequent events were followed with close attention by Labour, and the general strike in Ireland has been hailed by the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; as a signal example of the success of working class solidarity. &quot; Direct action,&quot; it says, &quot; has been put to splendid use, and it has won a splendid victory.&quot; Such events as these undoubtedly contribute to the development of unrest in this country.The Industrial Court.The Engineering and National Employers&apos; Federation has protested to the Industrial Court against award No. 180 in the engineering and foundry trades on the ground that it is irregular and ultra vires. The grounds of protest are that the Court appear to have based their award on the principle that the remuneration of the various classes of workpeople should, in ordinary circumstances, &quot; depend on the value of the work done, and this depends on the state of the market and the demand for the products of the workshop,&quot; and further, that in paragraph 16 of the award, the Court state that they have given consideration to the wages movements in other industries in comparison with those which have taken place in the engineering and allied trades. The Federations state that no evidence was given on this point, and that it was not within the scope of the references to the Court. The Industrial Court have replied that before issuing the decision the Court had the matter under very careful consideration, and came to the conclusion that a decision in the terms chosen wTas well within their powers. The Court further state that they have given the matter further consideration, but see no good reason to alter the opinion which they have expressed.Unemployment Insurance Bill.The amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Bill made in standing committee to allow approved societies under the Health Insurance Acts to administer the unemploy-ment insurance scheme has aroused the strongest opposition on the part of the Trade Unions. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress have sent a unanimous request to the Government that this amendment should be struck out on the report stage, otherwise the committee would advise the Trade Unions to boycott the Act. The Parliamentary Committee of the Scottish Trades Union Congress have passed a resolu-tion protesting against the amendment and calling upon the Labour Party to use every effort to defeat &quot; this sinister attempt to undermine the Trade Union movement.&quot; It is reported that the executive committee of the National Federation of General Workers has decided that if the amendment is not struck out, the members of the Trade Unions affiliated to it would be advised to refuse to pay contributions. Protests against the amendment have also been passed by conferences of the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, and of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, and strong opposition has also been expressed by Mr. James 0&apos;Grady, M.P., Mr. John Hill, Secretary of the Boilermakers&apos; Society ; Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., who regards it as a direct blow at the principle of Trade Unions ; Mr. A. Pugh, General Secretary of the Iron and Steel(C 1986) 2 A 3
Trades Confederation ; Mr. E. L. Poulton, General Secretary of the Boot and Shoe Opera-tives&apos; Union; and Mr. R. B. Walker, General Secretary of the Agricultural Labourers&apos; Union. On the other hand, a committee has been formed consisting of the following&apos; Members of the House of Commons to watch the interests of approved friendly societies :  Mr. G. Locker-Lampson (Chairman); Sir John Butcher, Sir Thomas Bramsdon, Mr. T. Davies, Mr. A. R. Jephcott, Major Reginald Blair, Mr. C. Jesson, Mr. A. R. Barrand, Colonel Raw, Mr. John Murray, Mr. R. B. Chadwick, and Sir Alfred. H. Warren (Secretary) and certain friendly societies have expressed the view that injustice would be done to them if the right to administer unemployment benefit were denied to them.The Co-operative Movement and Income Tax.Conferences have been arranged by the Co-operative Union to be held in various centres with the object of protesting against the proposals of the Royal Commission on Income Tax with regard to the taxation of co-operative funds.Profit-Sharing and Labour Co-partnership.A report on profit-sharing and labour co-partnership in the United Kingdom (Cmd. 544) has been prepared by the Ministry of Labour. The previous report upon this subject was issued in 1912, and the frequent inquiries for further information have shown that the time has come for another general survey of the whole movement in this country. The report shows that the number of schemes which were in existence at the 31st October, 1919, so far as reported to the Department, was 182, and the number of persons employed by the firms having these schemes was about a quarter of a million. These 182 schemes were the survivors of 380 schemes which had been started at one time or another since the year 1865, with an isolated example in 1829. Thus, more than half of all the known schemes have come to an end, the average duration of these abandoned schemes being about 8^ years. The greatest activity in the formulation of profit-sharing schemes was shown in the four years from 1889 to 1892. Other periods of activity in the profit-sharing movement have been in 1908 and 1909,1912-14, and 1919. It would appear in general that periods of industrial unrest are associated almost invariably with a strong wave of interest -in profit-sharing. While in every year a certain number of firms are unable to pay any bonus at all, the average bonus over a long series of years may be put at about 5 or 6 per cent., the equivalent of two or three weeks&apos; wages.Woolcombers? Bonus on Production.The Yorkshire Managers&apos; and Overlookers&apos; Society, at a meeting at Bradford on the 10th inst., approved an amended scheme for bonus on production in the woolcombing industry in Bradford. The scheme provides that the weight of tops produced by each firm during the excess profits duty standard years is to be ascertained and the hours in aggregate worked by the employees concerned is to be ascertained for the same period. The aggregate hours divided into the aggregate weight gives the &quot; pounds per operative hour,&quot; and this figure becomes the standard. The standard being fixed, each four weeks&apos; production is compared therewith and a bonus will be paid on any increased production in the proportion of 1 per cent, on wages earned for each 1 per cent, increase on the standard. In special cases, owing to entirely new or additional plant or other, circum-stances, certain firms may require to have the standard fixed on lines which would have to be agreed. It is provided that the operatives are to benefit to the extent of 50 per cent, of the increased weight obtained by reorganisation or introduction of special plant. Should any difference arise between the federations concerned and the unions concerned, or their members, regarding the administration of this agreement, and a conference between representatives of the federations and trade unions fails to reach an agreement, the question shall be referred to the National Wool (and Allied) Textile Industrial Council. Either party may, by giving one month&apos;s notice, convene a meeting of the parties concerned for the purpose of reconsidering the scheme, it being understood that the scheme be given a reasonable trial.Miners.A delegate conference of the M.F.G.B. was held on the 15th inst. to consider the result of the national ballot of the question of accepting the Government^ offer or striking

Triple Alliance.A meeting of the Triple Alliance will take place in London on the 5th May to consider questions connected with the development of the Alliance. At present all the constituent unions, namely, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain and the National Transport Workers Federation are intimately concerned with wage questions. The progress of the programmes of the respective unions will be reviewed at this meeting. It is also reported that questions with regard to the inclusion of other unions within the Alliance will be considered.Amalgamation.An important amalgamation is proposed between the five unions of blastfurnacemen in England and Wales. Negotiations have been going on for some time. The original proposal for amalgamation was made by the Eastern Midland District which suggested the fusion of the Cleveland and Durham and Eastern Midland districts. This was con-sidered a year ago and it was decided that if an amalgamation were to be promoted it would be better to include all districts in England and Wales. At the national conference negotiations continued on this basis and the joint executives have prepared a draft scheme. A ballot of the various unions is now to be taken and a recommendation has been made that the scheme should be adopted. The unions are : Cleveland and Durham Blast-furnacemen&apos;s and Cokemen&apos;s Association ; Cumberland and Lancashire Blastfurnacemen&apos;s Association; Eastern Midland Blastfurnacemen&apos;s Oreminers&apos; and Kindred Trades Association; Midland (Staffordshire) Blastfurnacemen, Cokemen, and By-Product Workers ; South Wales and Monmouthshire District Association of Blastfurnacemen and Quarrymen, Oreminers, and Kindred Trades.The second ballot of the Amalgamated Society of General Tool Makers on the question of joining the Amalgamated Engineering Union gave the necessary majority in favour of fusion. This decision will greatly increase the power of the Amalgamated Engineering Union as all the five societies which organise general engineering workers are now included in the scheme.Non-Unionism.At a meeting of the Cardiff No. 8 Branch of the National Union of Rail way men it was decided to support an effort to eliminate non-unionists from the railway services by asking the members to give the names of those known to them who are outside the pale of the Society to the Branch Secretary. At a recent conference of the Hereford Farmers&apos; Union and the Workers&apos; Union the delegates of the latter requested the Farmers&apos; Union to refuse to employ any non-unionist after 1st June. It was agreed eventually that both farmers and labourers should encourage non-unionists to join their respective unions.to secure the original demand advanced by the M.F.G-.B. The figures from the coalfields are of some interest and may therefore be given in detail: For Acceptance. For Strike.
Trade Unionism and the Co-operative Movement.The Scottish Labour and Co-operative Council has circularised all the labour and trade union organisations in Scotland, asking if they are in favour of a proposal that the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society should obtain full legal powers to establish a complete banking system.Trade Union Conferences.National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motor men and Electrical Workers. The biennial conference of this Union was recently held at Southport. Two hundred delegates representing over 40,000 members were present. The Report of the General Secretary dealt mainly with the question of the financial stability of the Society and especially the out-of-work fund. The General Secretary pointed out that if financial stability was to be assured, and if their union was to guarantee benefit to members who were bona fide out of work, there would have to be a tightening up of the rules or considerable increases in contributions. It was decided to increase the union contributions by 25 per cent, and the salaries of branch officials by 50 per cent. It was also decided to set up district committees for the purpose of regulating wages and conditions of work. The President stated that it should be the policy of their Executive to seek amalgamation with the skilled-side of the trade union movement and thus to secure for their members a status corresponding to the responsibilities of their craft. ,National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. At the 29th annual meeting of this Union the report of the National Minimum Wage Com-mittee submitting a scale representing an increase of not less than 125 per cent, over pre-war wages was adopted. The question of amalgamation with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees and the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union was considered. The Committee which was appointed some time ago presented a majority report declaring against amalgamation, but recommending that negotiations should be re-opened with the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees only. The minority report favoured amalgamation and suggested that a ballot should be taken on the question of amalgamation with each of the two unions separately. The Executive supported the majority report, but the conference adopted the minority report, and the ballot will there-fore be taken. A resolution was passed with regard to the setting up of Trade Boards in the following terms : &quot; This Annual General Meeting urges upon the Minister of Labour the desirability of setting up as quickly as possible under the Trade Boards Act, Boards for England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, with a Central Co-ordinating Board for the whole of the distributive trades with a view to dealing with the extremely low wages being paid to a large number of those employed, and that the rate of wages fixed by the Trade Boards should be based upon a normal working week of 48 hours or less.&quot;Resolutions were also passed in favour of the nationalisation of the coal industry and the socialisation of all forms of industry.Amalgamated Union of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers.  At the Annual Delegate Meeting of this Union the report of the Committee on the proposals for amalgamation with the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehouse-men and Clerks and the National Warehouse and General Workers&apos; Union was submitted, and it was announced that the ballot of members with regard to amalgamation would be proceeded with immediately. A number of speakers maintained that the Trade Boards which are being set up for the distributive trades were aimed at the trade unions and would bring down wages. This view is curiously different from that of the Shop Assistants&apos; Union (quoted above) with which this union proposes to amalgamate.National Union of Clerks. At a special conference of this Union held at Blackpool recently it was decided to develop the guild principle in a more extensive form with the object of enabling the guilds to exercise greater control over administration, and a form of decentralisation on geographical lines was adopted which will allow to the various districts of the Union more power in their own areas in administrative matters. The organisation of this Union was explained in some detail in this Report, page 81. The proposal to affiliate with the newly-formed National Federation of Professional, Technical, Administrative and Supervisory Workers was defeated by an overwhelming majority.National Federation of Law Clerks. At the annual conference of this body held at Birmingham it was decided to register the Federation as a trade union and it was announced that the Federation represents 7,000 members organised in 32 local societies.
All inquiries relating to this report should be addressed to : Intelligence Division,Ministry of Labour,Montagu House,Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.National Union of Journalists. The annual conference of the National Union of Journalists was held recently at Cardiff. It was decided that a ballot of members should be taken on the question of affiliation with the Trades Union Congress, and it was recom-mended that the Executive should transfer the funds of the Union to the Co-operative Bank. An increase of subscription was decided upon and a resolution was passed instructing the Executive to push forward at the earliest opportunity a revised programme for improving wages.National Union of Teachers. At the annual conference of this Union held at Margate, &apos; the most important subject of discussion from the standpoint of the Ministry of Labour was the question of the formation of a Joint Industrial Council. Mr. Thomas, Bromley, moved that steps should be taken to expedite the formation of Joint Industrial Councils-representing organised teachers on the one hand and the education authorities on the other, on the ground that Whitley Councils were a half-way to joint control and full partnership. An amendment was moved that steps should be taken to raise the status of the teaching profession by establishing it upon a self-governing basis with full partner-ship in both national and local administration. The amendment was rejected by a large majority and the resolution was then passed.National Association of Men Teachers. During the conference of the National Union of Teachers, a sectional conference of men teachers met and formally constituted a new organisation, namely, the National Association of Men Teachers, to protect the interests of men teachers and to resist the principle of equal pay for women.National Union of School Teachers. At the annual meeting of this Union, which represents uncertificated teachers, a resolution was passed demanding that the difference between the present scale of pay for certificated and uncertificated teachers should not be widened.Professional Workers.It may be noted that there are certain characteristics which are common to the societies mentioned in last week&apos;s Report as affiliated to the Council of the Federation of Professional, Technical, Scientific, Administrative and Supervisory Workers. These societies may be divided into, roughly, four classes (1) industrial and technical; (2) financial; (3) public services, and (4) professions other than the above. The characteristics which distinguish members of these associations are the following  (a) They are brain workers rather than manual workers ; (b) they are employed persons rather than employers; (c) they occupy positions of some responsibility and many of them control the work of others ; (d) their functions are such that they require in most cases long periods of special training, either academic or practical; (e) they occupy to some extent the position of a third party, distinct from employers on the one hand and manual labour on the other.Labours International Relations.The executive committee of the International Federation of Trade Unions met at Amsterdam on the 8th April.
