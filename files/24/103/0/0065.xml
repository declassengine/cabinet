ECRET,(1)   In connection with the memorandum on this subject by the Minister of Health (CP, 1001) circulated to the Cabinet on March 30th, I am in agreement with my colleague in his suggestion that the Government cannot take any definite action to prevent local authorities from imposing the stipulation on their employees that all applications for increases of salary are to be made through the Trade Union or Association representing the Officer or workman concerned.   It is considered that this would be the attitude of employers generally In respect of the demands of their employees,(2)   The real difficulty arises in the second consider-ation outlined by the Minister of Health,   In my opinion the local authorities have acted unwisely in stipulating that increases of salary by way of ,;;ar Bonus should be conditional upon membership of a Trade Union,   The proper and general attitude of an employer to his employees on this question is that of strict neutrality, and I concur in the view expressed in the reply sent by the Ministry of Health to the Poplar Board of Guardians as a result of their Resolution,(3)   Tho Introduction of legislation to restrict the power of the local authorities to differentiate between their employees would raise many difficulties, not the least of which would be, that when local authorities and employers made membership of a Trade JJnion a bar to employment, no departmental protests were made and no question of legislation was raised,   I think that the present attitude of tho Governmentshould/-1-
should &quot;bo the same as In the past, viz;-   conditions of employment are matters for settlement between the parties except in so far as it may be necessary by Act of Parliament to regulate those conditions generally for the purpose of protection as is dene by the adminis-tration of the Trade Boards Acts and the Factory Acts.(SB).
