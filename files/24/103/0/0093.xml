\Thh Doouiuoini is th. Property of His Britawiu Majesty s Government,Printed for the Cabinet.   April 17, 11)20.SECRET.[186981]MEMORANDUM.Foreign Policy and Inter-Allied Debts.1. A TREASURY proposal was recently submitted to the Cabinet that, irrespective of American action, we should wipe out the debts of our allies to us arising out of the war. It must be accepted that American co-operation in a general scheme for the cancellation of debt is out of the question for the present. But the Treasury view is that, even so, independent action by His Majesty ^Government would probably benefit us in the long run. The arguments put forward for this view were purely financial and economic, and the moment would now seem opportune for those more general arguments, which bear on the Treasury proposal, to be considered. The question whether His Majesty&apos;s Government, without waiting for a lead from the United States Government, should take the first step towards getting rid of the present load of international war debt is undoubtedly one which ought to be decided not merely as a matter of money profit or loss but on general grounds of foreign policy.2. These general considerations are outlined in paragraphs 8 to 14 below. For the sake of clearness the present position as between ourselves and the United States Government must first be shortly recalled.3. In April 1919 the Prime Minister transmitted to President Wilson and to M. Clemenceau a scheme, drawn up for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for the rehabilitation of European credit and public financing of relief and reconstruction. The main feature of this scheme, which was put forward as &quot; the constructive contribution of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the solution of the greatest financial problem ever set to the modern world,&quot; was the creation of 1,000,000,0001. worth of German reparation bonds, the interest to be guaranteed by the three principal allied and associated Governments and by certain neutral Governments. The objects of it were sympathetically looked upon by the Americans at Paris, but the scheme was received with horror at Washington. The essence of the American objection to any proposal of the kind lies generally in the swing back of the pendulum to the tradition of aloofness from European entanglements, and, in particular, in their dislike of our whole reparation policy. They are determined not to do anything which will help the European allies to extract more reparation from Germany. On this rock all sugges-tions for American help in European reconstruction have shattered and will continue to shatter Since last summer therefore the negotiations between the British and American Treasuries have been confined to the postponement of interest on the debt. Quite-recently, however, the Treasury have put on formal record, for the benefit of the United States Treasury, the British view as to cancellation, which had by that time been definitely dissented from by. the United States authorities. Their present view is as strongly adverse as ever.4. The question therefore is whether we should proceed to the cancellation of debt independently of the United States Government. It would mean, roughly, that we should continue to owe 800;000,000L to the United States, while giving up approximately the same sum*:i:&apos; owed to us. principally by France and Italy. Belgium has already received this concession.5. The economic and financial benefits to be expected if we retain our claim to-this sum are dubious. No arrangements have yet been made for payment by the. debtors either of interest or of principal, and there is no particular ground for believing that (with perhaps some small exceptions) any of them will ever be able to repay the principal. As regards our own debt to the United States, we are, I understand, proposing to create a sinking fund which will repay 28 per cent, by 1947. and the United States Government are undertaking the negotiations on the assumption that we shall offer similar terms to our allies. But shall we in fact get anything at all from them ?   The answer to this question must depend* The Russian debt of 520,000,000^. to us is not included. 53   [2914] &apos;
on a factor which no one can estimate with certainty, namely, the power &quot;of the French and Italians to raise money during the next twenty years or so. That power in turn depends upon- (a) political developments and (6) the capacity of these countries to rebuild their economic life. These are both unknown quantities. All that is certain is that, if we hold them to their debt, and refrain from a step which will go far towards clearing away the mass of paper now jamming the European &apos; economic machine, we decrease the chances of French and Italian recovery and increase the risk of political upheavals, in which our money may vanish in any case. Clearly our main interest is a prosperous France and Italy. The Treasury view is, I understand, that by renouncing our debt we stand to lose practically nothing except vexatious claims for money which we shall not get, and that a prosperous France and Italy are worth more to us in hard cash thau a claim for 800,000,0001, the justice of which is not fully accepted by the debtors.6. In the second place, it is not to the advantage of our export trade that these debts should be paid, unless payment is spread over a very long period indeed, for they can only be paid by decreasing French and Italian imports of British manufactures and by increasing French and Italian exports to us. The situation is fundamentally the same as that created by the payment of the indemnity by France to Germany after 1870, the results of which are well known. It may be added that, even if we have to shoulder the burden of paying interest and principal on our debt to the United States after having given up our claims on Europe, the situation will not be without advantages for our export trade in its competition with that of the United States.7. Such, in broadest outline, are the economic arguments for the Treasury proposal. What they come to is this. Unless something is done on a big scale, the situation is such that the international financial machine, without which European recovery is impossible, cannot easily start working again ; and, of all measures within the range of practical politit s, cancellation of the allied debts owing to this country is the only measure comprehei; ive enough in scope to give the necessary impetus to the machine.8. When we consider the bearing of the proposal on foreign policy, we pass from probabilities to at least one certainty. It is certain that a state of things under which our allies, who are impoverished while we remain relatively rich, have to discharge heavy obligations to us as the result of a victorious war, must promote bad feeling. It must be remembered that, as long as these debts remain, Germany is not much worse off, if at all, than France and Italy. True, she has to make reparation, but otherwise she has little or no external debt. And there is more. The connexion between the indemnities and inter-allied indebtedness is such that, in practice, the exaction of our debts from our allies will mean that we (if we except the United States) shall be the sole recipients of any benefits from German reparation payments. In addition, our allies must for years to come depend, France largely and Italy almost wholly, upon us for coal a position out of which it seems inevitable, for domestic reasons, that we should try to extract the utmost profit. This being the situation, it is hard to see how, if we insist on our debts, we can fail to lose our old position in the European system, which depended upon our being felt to be neither oppressive nor unjust9. If, on the other hand, we renounce our debts, we clear the atmosphere at once. We obtain the moral leadership of the world at a stroke. And we obtain it at a moment when it is a practical necessity for Europe that we should have it. For Europe cannot be restored, the problems of Germany and the rest of Central Europe cannot be solved, unless we are in a position to guide and direct our allies, and if necessary to exert pressure on them, in the problems of economic and political reconstruction of which the indemnity question forms part. If there is any force in the argument of the preceding paragraph, the cancellation of our debts is the pre-requisite to giving us the prestige without which we cannot hope to play the dominant political part marked out for us by our economic strength.10. The alternatives, in fact, are critical. France and Italy, bankrupt in victory, are sullen and disappointed. In the general disillusionment some step is now required which will strike the imagination of men and turn the scale towards contentment. It is not, as the Secretary of the United States Treasury has suggested, a question of exciting false hopes in improvident countries, but rather of doing something as a practical earnest that better days are beginning. Spiritually and psychologically the effect on the new Europe would be of incalculable benefit, and it is in our power to produce this effect at little, if any, material loss to ourselves. If, on the other hand, we refrain from this step, the prevalent conviction that we have always &quot; done well &quot;
o* We might, for instance, arrange for the actual writing-off of their debts to proceed pan passu with increases in the direct taxation imposed by Prance and Italy. ,out of wars will, for the reasons indicated above, crystallise into forms of extreme bitterness. No continental Government under present conditions is likely to be strong enough at home to resist the temptation to increase this bitterness and to use it for its own ends. We see this already in France. Whether we consider ships, or coal, or Syria, or the German question, the ground is strewn with inflammable material, and the surest way of preventing this material from piling up is to renounce our debt.11. The proper time for taking so momentous a step would require careful consideration, as would the conditions which should be attached to it. It is essential, if the full political effect is to be obtained, that the concession should not be made in an atmosphere of bargaining. We should cast our bread upon the waters and make it plain to the world that, whatever malice may insinuate, we entered neither upon the war nor upon the peace with sordid material ends in view. Such an attitude would he compatible with requiring from our allies suitable guarantees for a wise policy of financial reconstruction/ and with the issue of a solemn, warning that anti-British action will in future be tolerated in no field of policy.12. A secondary, though most important, matter for consideration is the effect of the concession on American opinion. The first impulse in America would almost certainly be to regard it as a characteristically &quot; slim&quot; move, designed to force the hand of the United States. This would undoubtedly be the official view, which would be supported at first by large sections of public opinion. The reaction, however, would probably soon come. For the moment the American conscience as regards Europe seems dead, but conscience does not die in so sentimental and idealistic a people; it is only numb; and, if the British action were presented on the loftiest ethical grounds, a revulsion of feeling would quickly follow, which would not merely improve Anglo-American relations, but would profoundly affect the whole American attitude towards Europe. The result might well be similar action on the American side before a year was out.13. From this point of view it is very desirable that, if we are to act, we should act in good time before the Presidential election campaign begins. Each party regards anti-British sentiment as one of its leading assets in the campaign, and it seems likely that this summer will see the two parties competing&apos; to exploit that sentiment with an intensity unprecedented even in the history of the United States. Here again is much inflammable matter, pregnant with dangers for us, which will lose their sting if we come forward with a policy seen to be generous and self-sacrificing beyond the possibility of cavil.14. It would also seem most desirable that, if we are to take this action, we should do so before the meeting of the International Financial Conference which is to take place next month under the auspices of the League of Nations.15. One question remains : Can this policy be made acceptable to the British tax-payer ? The difficulty is that none of the above arguments, even if they are sound, can be publicly expounded. Parliament cannot be told that France and Italy are bankrupt in any case, so that we should only be writing off a bad debt. It cannot be told that, even if the debt is not wholly bad, some sacrifice is required of us to avoid dangerous political developments between our allies and ourselves. It cannot be told that there is no other way to prevent the indemnity question from becoming a perpetual irritation. It cannot be told that the state of American opinion is full of danger. There is, however, one fact which in any case must be made public sooner or later  the fact, namely, that the best that the taxpayer can hope is to get a quarter of the debt paid in a quarter of a century. It seems possible that this depressing fact, coupled with the general economic arguments for remission, and with an appeal on the ground that a beau geste showing high constructive imagination is justly required of Great Britain in the interests of impoverished Europe, would make the proposal palatable to the country. The step once taken, our reasons could be explained privately to the City, to the city editors of the newspapers, and to responsible trade union leaders, leaving them to create the necessarv atmosphere.C. or KApril 17, 1920.   -
