(PaPe.r No. CP. 1100) . Note, by tho Acting Secretary to the Cabinet.The Chief Secretary for Ireland desires the introduction of this Bill at the earliest possible date.   In a letter to the Lord Wivy Real, dated April 16th from the Irish Office, it is stated ;The Bill proposes to remedy a number of grievances which are the subject of long standing cornplairts on the part of Irish under sheriffs and have become more acute recently owing to the increased difficulties in executing judgments and decrees in Ireland.   It also proposes certain reforms in legal procedure with a view to facilitating and expediting the realisation of judgments and decrees.-The proposals &quot;embody recommendations of a Vie e-r regal Committee of inquiry appointed on the 29th October 1918.   The Bill was prepared on the instructions of Mr..- Macpherson who promised to give legislative effect to the recommendations, and the draft has been sanctioned by the Treasury.The under sheriffs are much concerned about their present position, which is both difficult and precarious,, and if the Bill is not introduced some of them may resign office, a course which would be likely to cause serious inconvenience to the public.The Bill is non-controversial,  so far as this can be said of any Irish measure.(Sgd..)    T. JONES,Acting Secretary., Whitehall Gardens, s*W* 1-. 20th April, 192q.
