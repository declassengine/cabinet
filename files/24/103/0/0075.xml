mj nts document  53 the Property ofH*3 -&apos;   n   &apos; ti- &apos;! viYa C //crn merit. - O&apos;(P 2866) From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 12th April 1920.(Received 13th, 8.m.)Clear the line.Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 8th April. Afghan delegation. Apart from question of our frontier tribes in which we shall refuse to recognise any Afghan right of interference, points which delegates are likely to mention are Afghan consular representation in India, postal arrangements at Peshawar, trade concessions, use of title of Plis Majesty in addressing Amir, absence of reply from King to Amir&apos;s two letters, and possibly grant of subsidy, though it seems unlikely that this will be openly asked for : (1) Consular representation. We would refuse even to consider possibility of Consul at Peshawar in present circumstances, as he would inevitably form focus for intrigues, but inconvenience of official Afghan agents of Karachi, Bombay and Calcutta would be much less, and we should not object to our representative holding out hopes of permission to establish Afghan Consulates there in event of friendship treaty being negotiated, provided we receive fullest reciprocal treatment in Afghanistan, and any British Consuls established there are properly treated and allowed liberty of action.(2) Postal arrangements. We shall attempt to arrange a simple scheme for exchange of posts at Landi Kotal which will do away with the necessity for any kind of Afghan postal arrangements at Peshawar.(3) Trade concessions. We should be prepared to hold out prospect of (? remission of) Jths of Customs duty on goods transported from Indian ports in bond without breaking bulk and exported into Afghanistan, on lines similar to existing grant of rebate on goods sent by Nushki route to Persia, by Bhamo-Tengyueh route to China, by Hoshiapur-Leh route to Russia and Chinese Turkestan, and on all goods exported to Kashmir.(4) Use of title of His Majesty. We are sure that our refusal to recognise this title which was conceded by us to Shah Kamran of Herat, Shah Shuja of Kabul and to Habibulla will perpetuate needless resentment and irritation against us in mind of Amir and his advisers and we regard persistence in refusal as a mistake. We hope that if negotiations prove satisfactory this attitude may now be modified.(5) Amir&apos;s letters to King. If Afghan delegates point to absence of reply as proof of our unfriendly attitude we think our representatives might say that His Majesty has delayed reply owing to the very grave doubts felt by tho British Government regarding the real attitude and intentions of the Amir, and to fact that we have as yet no treaty of friendship with him.(6) Subsidy, Our representatives will not touch on this question and if it is raised we will refer to you again. Should Afghan delegates show sign of seeking help from us in developing their country our representatives will assure them of our readiness to help and they might, perhaps, especially mention immense possibilities of irrigation of Afghan Seistan from Helmand under expert advisers.Kindly telegraph clear the line, whether you approve of this programme Prospects of concessions indicated would of course only be held out in the event of conversations proceeding favourably, and our representatives would be careful to avoid all appearance of making concessions to insolence or bluff.o
