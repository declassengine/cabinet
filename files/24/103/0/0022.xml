This.W.*. A;:iiMilitary Secret. 1&apos;From Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of Stale for India, 1st April 1920.(Received 4th.)4209.   1st April.In our telegram No. 3721, dated 19th March, we suggested that official denial of any aggressive intentions on our part, coupled with withdrawal of bulk of Malleson&apos;s force from Meshed, might serve to allay Bolshevik suspicions and so arrest their activities on Khorassan border.Information which lias since reached us emphasises in our opinion desirability of adopting some such measure, irrespective of decision regarding withdrawal from Meshed.2. Recent intelligence establishes fact that bulk of Bolshevik force in Transcaspia is now concentrated in area Askabad-Merv. This may possibly be due merely to considerations of convenience, e.g., maintenance, accommodation, &amp;c, or to desire, to impress Persians and Afghans with show of force; but Malleson&apos;s telegrams, consistently indicates likehood of incursions by Mohammedan irregulars, and we&apos; cannot ignore fact that, given sufficient transport, Bolsheviks themselves are now in position to invade Khorasan in considerable strength should they wish to do so.- It is true that none of the wires we have intercepted has given evidence of such intention, but this is not conclusive, as Bolsheviks can always use land lines for important messages.However that may be, situation demands increased vigilance on the part of Malleson frontier detachments. And possibly collision is daily becoming less remote. As long as these frontier detachments remain (? this) position (and without them Malleson cannot well fulfil his role) (? at present) protecting Khorassan from Bolshevik aggression (? we must) accept risk of entanglement on the frontier which may at any moment-provide Bolsheviks with pretext for aggression against Persian and endanger safe withdrawal of our frontier detachments to Meshed. We have informed Malleson that safety of his troops must be his first consideration and that he is at liberty to withdraw detachments should he consider it is necessary to do so. On military grounds (corrupt group) effect of such withdrawal cannot fail to be very bad, but this in our opinion would be lesser evil than military entanglement on frontier.We would, however, press for precise definition of attitude which Malleson should adopt in face of Bolshevik&apos;s aggression, for situation has altered materially since his role was defined in your unnumbered telegram of 9th February 1919.3. This has become of special importance in view of recent message from Governor-General of Khorassan to his subordinate at Daraguz, which is referred to in our Foreign Department telegram No. 559 S., of 31st March (corrupt group), this message gives us valuable insight of Persian attitude towards possible Bolshevik aggression, but adds much to difficulties of Malleson&apos;s position. If message accurately represents views of Persian Government we become committed to quixotic policy of supporting Government which is not prepared to support itself, and in our opinion this alone would.justify our withdrawal from East Persia. But apart from this, neutrality of frontier officials in event of attack would seriously compromise position of our frontier detachments, who have hitherto relied on moral, if not active, support of local authorities. Jt is for consideration whether in these circumstances detachments should not be withdrawn to Meshed without delay.4. xAs general conclusion we anticipate that the longer Malleson force remains in Khorassan, the more embarrassing is its position likely to become. Retention, of force is. however, foreshadowed in Foreign Office telegram to Teheran No. 153, of 23rd March, and this being so we consider everything possible should be done to remove cause of Bolshevik suspicion of our motives and so prevent military collision on frontier. In our opinion public declaration of our policy denying absolutely all aggressive intentions would do much to clear situation, as this at present threatens at any moment to develop to our disadvantage.
