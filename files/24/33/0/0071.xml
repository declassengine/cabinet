XIV.(26 November, 1917).Mr Venizelos arrived In London on November 13.   His visit to Rome, Paris and London has naturally thrown into the background the ordinary course of events in Greece, and the Entente Governments have had the advantage of hearing at first-hand the facts of the situation.   Some of the events of the last three weeks may, however, be considered, since they have an Immediate bearing on Greece&apos;s relations with the Entente Powers.The End Of the Parliamentary Session.The Parliamentary session concluded on October 26.   To what was stated as to its activities in Report XIII some facts may be added which appear from   study of the debates In detail.     A large part of the time was taken up with discussion of the question of sending members of the Skouloudhis and Lambros Governments before a specially constituted High Court of Justice.   After an animated debate it was also decided that a parliamentary Commissien should be appointed, under the presidency of Mr Vellianitis, to, examine into the conduct of the members of the first Ghounaris Government, with the exception of Mr Zoghraphos,   They are to present a report within Wo months.     The Ecclesiastical Commission appointed to try anti-Venizelist bishops for their interference in party politics passed sentences of deposition and, in some cases, internment in monasteries on most of the 15 bishops accused.     Similarly, officials of the Court cf Cassation and other Courts of Justice
2who had been proved guilty of Illegal proceedings were deposed, end on October 18 the Government promised that the principle sf the immovability of such officials, which is guaranteed by Clause 88 of the Constitution of 1864, should be at once re-established. The question of King Constantine1s intrigues with the German Court was also, as usual, much to the fore, and the Government has now published in full In the press the 49 telegrams which passed in a private code between Athens and Berlin during 1916 and 1917.   They possess more historical than actual importance.Financial Measures.Apart from these questions of political controversy most of the time of the Chamber was taken up with discussion of the financial situation.   The measures required to meet the big deficit described in last Report comprise a tax on alcohol, in view of the fact that distillers have made large profits during the past two years.   The Government promised that this was only a war measure.     Similarly, a tax on war profits, especially shipping profits, was voted after a long discussion.   The Government admitted an amendment providing &quot;that this tax should not apply to profits of less thar 10,000 drs.&quot;     Two millions of the proceeds of the tax are to be employed in the constitution of a Ship-building Society, and 10$ for the relief of Reservists1 fiamilies;   but shipping firms will recover these moneys if they engage within five years to buy new ships of twice the value of the tax.   As to the general financial situation of Greece, M, Sergent, before leaving for France, Informed the Government that all Greece1s extra military expenses will be covered by financial assistance from her Allies In the fc^jrm of loans or advances.   The National Bank will be authorised to IsLue notes against the deposit of gold to Greecefs
credit in a French or British bank. The internal loan envisaged by the 1917 Budget will also be issued shortly with the approval of M. Sergent.Economic Distress.The lack of food remains the burning question.     The sale of the prime necessities of life has been made a Government monopoly and maximum prices fixed.   The bread ration is now 100 drams, and the authorised prioe for bread is 1 dhrakhmi per oka (9d for 2,84 lbs) The bread cards which have been issued also enable the holders to purchase a limited quantity of coffee and sugar, the prices of which have been fixed at 5.60 dre. and 3.20 drs. per oka respectively. The Government is importing into Athens from the provinces all such meat as is available.   Other questions, such as heating and electric light, are also serious.   By restricting the hours at which restaurants, hotels and other places are open the consumption of electric light has been reduced 35$.   The lack of wood fuel is very great and the capital is at present living from hand-to-mouth on such wood cargoes as arrive.   The question of the export of the currant crop, on which, according to the press, the British Commission and the Privileged Company have reached an agreement, apparently has not been definitely settled owing to the British Governments lack of available transport.    (During 1916-17 the total exports of currants were only half as much as during 1914-15.or 1915-16). The economic question is the only vital question at the moment in Greece, and on its solution depends alike the political and military situation.The Political Situation.Political unrest appears to be taking two forms.   On the one
hand there are the subterranean pro- Constantine intrigues, discussed in last Report.   There was reason to believe that German agents were still numerous in the country, and the Government has now (November 30) ordered the deportation to one c  the islands of 150 suspected persons, 15 of them Germans.   Presumably, the probably well-founded rumours which have been rife of an impending Buigarc-German offensive against Salonlki have been a valuable weapon in the hands of these agents, as they were for a long time in the hands of King Ccnstantine. -On the other hand, the Left wing of the Venizelist party (Socialists and Republicans) are by no means content with the present political situation.     A Socialist organ, the Erghatikos Aghon (&quot;The Labour Struggle&quot;), has been published for some weeks past in Athens, and frankly demands the introduction of a Republic. While it has not a pro-German tendency, it expresses Itself as against any active participation on the part of Greece In the war. Papers like the Rizpspastis openly attack King Alexander in violent terms and denounce the Monarchy.     This is not only extremely trying to the King, but is apparently very distasteful to Mr Venizelos and his saner supporters who are working for reconciliation. Unfortunately some handle is given to these attacks by the King&apos;s retention of Count Merkatis and other members of the Court entourage who are suspect.in Venizelist circles.   The King is, however, according to impartial testimony, honestly trying to carry out the new national policy inaugurated by Venizelos1 return to power. It is all the more important that he should openly dissociate himself from the agents of the&apos; old regime.   Only when this becomes clear to the nation as a whole, will things improve.   So long as &quot;aristocratic&quot; circles in Athens can still find reason to think that Alexander is merely keeping his father&apos;s throne warm, acceptance of the new regime
can hardly become general.   The more King Alexander openly shows his agreement with the new regime, the more will the Government5s hands be strengthened to restrain and discredit the violent agitators in the Venizelist ranks and to check the demand for whole-sale reprisals on anti-Venizelist partisans.The Government has probably acted wisely in at once proceeding to the mcbilieatietfi of further classes, comprising certain categories of the 1913A, 1913B and 1914 classes!  While this will hardly have been received with satisfaction, it is probable that little active trouble will be caused provided the food-supply question can&apos;be put on a better footing.Greecefe Relations with her Allies.No information is as yet to hand as tc the effects in Greece of the Italian defeats.   The cordial welcome extended to Mr Venizolos in this country can only have an admirable effect, for the Greeks are very susceptible t$ polite attentions of this kind. (The telegram from the Mayor of Athens, published in Saturday&apos;s press (November 24), is a procf of this).   Further, the speech of the Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs in the Hsuse of Commons in reply to Mr Noel Buxt$n has, as was anticipated, evoked a chorus of praise from the Greek press of all parties and clearly relieved the suspicion disseminated by unfriendly agents that this country could contemplate a peace with Bulgaria behind the back of, or to the disadvantage of, her Balkan Allies.26.11.17.
