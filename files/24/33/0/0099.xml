THIS DOmmiT is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAE11IC liAJESTT!sGOvERIIuEHT.SECRET. WAR   CABIITET,G.T..-2798.CAUSES OF DISCOHTI-ffT &amp; LABOUR UKRES.T. (Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson)*i circulate for the information of my Colleagues a Memorandum &quot;which has been submitted to me by the Editor-in-Chief of the War Aims Committee0       I think that Ministers who are making speeches in the country would like to bear in mind the points he maJkes as to the causes of discontent and Labour unrest vrhich provide Pacifist speakers with their opportunity for influencing opinion.(Signed) EDWARD CARSON.A   \2, Whitehall Gardens, s*x. 29 November, 1917.,
ft i$  1 3 iS -x)OU: &apos;M IS THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT-OTIC MAJESTY1 S.  GOVELtiMSNT.SECRET.Reports received from inquirers into the state of G.T.2798. - . .opinion iri Sheffield,   Barrow and Derby*     show that r while there is little direct Pacifist sentiment, acertain discontent with the present conditions of life is providing a field In which the Pacifist seed may be sown,.(1)     The lack of Housing accommodation in Barrow is one such cause,       and I am Informed that whereas the Government have undertaken to build 250 houses,   the work has not yet been begun, (2)     Both In Barrow and in Derby it is feared that the long queues of women waiting to obtain provisions from the shops will give rise to trouble when the bad weather begins,(3) In Barrow the shortage of beer Is mentioned as one of the chief grievances.       The public houses are sometimes chut on Saturday evenings owing to exhaustion of supplies,     and the men,    in a discontented frame of mind,    are left in the streets - where they easily become listeners to Pacifist oratory -   While In the public houses they are safe from this,    as the Pacifists are generally teetotallers who will not show themselves in these abodes of iniquity.       This sounds frivolous,   but I am assured that it is quite a serious factor in the situation.What has been said above applies generally to Sheffield also,O 1,   It is suggested that the Food Controller mightorganise central markets in large towns for the sale of staple articles of food in covered halls. It is- said that many Purveyors rather encourage the formation of
queues as a good advertisement for their shops. 2.    It is thought desirable that there should he a renewal of the pledge given by Mr. Asquith!s Government to restore Trade Union conditions after the War, and that the renewed pledge should be signed by the Prime Minister.pi    It is suggested that the strongest possible pledge by the Government to introduce Legislation dealing -with Housing,   Education;   Public Health and other social matters   -   if they remain in office after the war   -   might have a considerable effect in taking the wind out of the agitators1 sails.These obviouly cannot be questions with which the National War Aims Committee car, deal effectively without a lead from the Government,   and without binding myself to the actual suggestions made,    I hope some steps   may be taken in this direction. So far as I can ascertain,there is little direct evidence that a desire to end the War by c ompromise Is making any he ad?/ay, .   but present inconveniences and doubts as to the future are unquestionably tending to bring about a condition of affairs which might in time undermine the resolution of the people.(Signed; Gerard Flennes).
