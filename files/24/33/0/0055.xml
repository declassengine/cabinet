War Cabinet.I forward, for the information of the War Cabinet, a copy of a Memorandum, dated 23rd instant, by the Director-General of Movements and Railways, regarding the amount of shipping which will be required for the conveyance and up-keep of an American Army in France..(Sd.)   w.R. Robertson.C. X. G. S.War Office, S.v/.1. 24th November, 1917.
CtI.GtS.SHIPPING FOR AMERICAN ARMY.1, When the first American transportation Commission cameto this country in May last, I made out a memorandum for them estimating - &quot;based purely on British experience - the amount of shipping which would be required for the conveyance and upkeep of an American Army of 500,000 men (18 divisions) in Franee.I sent you a copy of my memorandum on the 2nd May. 2. During the last fey/ weeks the American Staff has beenengaged in considering the amount of shipping that will be required to transport to France and maintain 4 corps - say 965,000 men and 212,000 horses by the 1st May 1918,General Bliss has asked me to assist him in working out this problem, and to answer three questions, viz:   What additional shipping would be required in order to have -(1)     2 corps with auxiliaries complete in France by1st May, 1918, with 90 days reserve. (2)     3 corps with auxiliaries complete in France by-Is t May, with 90 days reserve. (3)     4 corps with auxiliaries complete in France by 1st May, with 90 days reserve.43. I attach a memorandum   which has been prepared givingthe answers to these questions.The answers have been arrived at upon the following facts and assumptions supplied to us by the Americans, viz:(a)     Number of American troops in France on 3lst Oct-ober, 1917, 112,000; horses 16,000; number of days reserves for the above - nil.(b).Not reproduced, as it is thought this minute will give the I7ar Cabinet all the information they require.(Initialled)     L;.R.R.
(b) The shipping now available for moving Amerijcan troops, horses and stores is capable of moving :-90,0G0 men 19,000 horses 364,000 dead weight tons of 1nl.li.tar7 st^ores^.(c) It was agreed to deduct 20^ for contingencies from the figures given in (b).(d) It was assumed that in the case of troop ships the turn round would be 7 weeks and in the case of horse ships 7-! weeks.(e) It was assumed as regards cargo ships that l/lO would work from the U.K. and that the turn round in their case would be 4 weeks, and that the remaining 9/10 would work from the U.S.A. and that in their case the turn round would be 0 weeks.(f) It was assumed that the daily scale of maintenance of all classes of stores imported in to Prance,  (excepting equipr ment accompanying units, horse vehicles, mechanical trans-port and air craft) should be 30 lbs per man per day as compared with 27.35 lbs for the British troops during the . last 6 months - See table A of memorandum.(g) It was assumed that the troop ships would take the whole of the equipment of units including those sent via U.K. and the horse ships the whole cf the horse vehicles.Basing our calculations upon the above facts and assumptions the answers to General Bliss&apos;s questions are set out in Appendix B cf the memorandum.Put shortly the answers are as follows : -(1). In order to h/tve ?. corps with auxiliaries complete inFrance by 1st May and 90 days reserve, it will be necessary: that in addition to what they now have available, the Americans should find 536,100 gross tons of shipping,\rl ) .
(2).      In order to have 3 corps with auxiliaries and reserves in Prance by 1st May it would be necessary for the Ameri-cans to find 1,735,300 gross tons of additional shipping. (3).      In order to have 4 corps with auxiliaries and reserves in Prance by 1st May the additional shipping required would be 2,740,700 gross tons.. 5. These are the answers to General Bliss1s questions, but Ihave ventured to work out on the same basis the answers to two supplementary questions, viz:(1A)     How much extra shipping would be required to bring and maintain 2 corps with auxiliaries and 90 days reserves in Prance by 1st May, to be followed by the 3rd corps at the same rate of importation, stating date by which the 3rd Corps would be complete.The answer would be   the 3rd corps   would be complete by the 15th August and the additional shipping required over that now available would be 764,100 gross tons. (2A)     How much extra shipping would be required to complete the 4th corps with auxiliaries and reserves following on after the 3rd corps In (1A) and by what date would the 4th corps be complete?The answer would be the 4th corps would be completed by the end of November, and the additional shipping required over that now available would be 992,100 gross tons.. (Appendix C).6. In bringing these calculations to your notice, I wish toemphasise two facts, viz:-(1) This is not my business, but having produced the memorandum of May, and having been asked by General Bliss to work out the answers to these questions, andhaving
having a good deal of the necessary statistical informa-tion in the possession of the Directorates of this Department, I thought it my duty to comply with the request.(2)      I do not pretend that the calculations in the memor-andum represent the true situationc   They have been most carefully worked out by very competent offioers on the data given by me, and it will be seen from para-10 of the memorandum that there is a possibility of at least 200,000 gross tons having to be added to the figures in para.4 and 5 above.   In any case, I consider the figures are on the conservative side, that is to say, any -corrections that may be necessary will add to the estimate of additional shipping required.I may add that General Bliss has told me I am at liberty to makeuse of the information he has given me.(Signed). W. Guy Granet. 25.11.17. DcGcMoR.
