Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. &apos;-&apos;-:JS&apos;\ BA17/0S1.\7eekly Report on Austria-Hungary.   XXI. (20th Hoyember, 1917.)The visit of Count Czernin to Berlin on the oocasion of a German Crown Counoil and the announcement that the Polish Question was the main subject of discussion has had a lively repercussion throughout Central Europe and has made the general public realise more clearly than before how inextricably the various national problems are interwoven and how increasingly difficult it is to solve one without the others.The proposed cession of Galicia to Poland in its bearing upon the Poles and Ruthenes (Ukrainians) has already been dis-cussed in the Weekly Report on Poland (November 24).    There is another, no lees important side to the question - namely, its effect upon the Dual system and upon the whole future of the nationalities of Austria-Hungary (and therefore indirectly of the Balkans).    The question at issue is thus nothing less then the complete reconstruction of Central Europe.If Poland were to be added as a third State to the Habsburg Monarchy, this would automatically bring the existing con-etitutional system to an end.    Under the Austrian constitution no cession of territory may be made without the sanction of a two-thirds majority in Parliament; and therefore unless resort is to be had to a coup d*etat, it is obvious that the Galician problem raises all the internal Austrian problems without ex-eeption, and places the Government in a more difficult political position than ever.     It is moreover certain that not merely the Austrian Parliament, whose claim to be consulted is unanswerable,
ilI- 2 -373but also the Hungarian Parliament will insist, and rightly so, upon being heard in the matter.     The German Reichstag is about to put forward a similar claim and perhaps to use the whole question aB a lever for asserting fresh influence in matters of foreign policy.     Thus quite apart from any question of con-suiting the representatives of the Polish nation itself, the statesmen of the Central Powers will find it very hard to avoid submitting any arrangement to at least three Parliaments for ratification.     This aspect of the question ie likely to be ventilated at the approaching meeting of the Austrian and Hungarian Delegations.     The press alike in Vienna, Budapest and Berlin is raising its voice more and more loudly against the settlement of such all-important problems by secret arrangements between the dynasties or even the Cabinets,and the running   amuck of the Lenin-Trotzky &quot;government&quot; is likely for both good and bad reasons to accentuate still further the growing aversion to such methods.In one sense the establishment of Trialism, as between Austria, Hungary and Poland, might seem to be an improvement, since in all matters of high policy two of the three States would tend to combine and place the third in a minority.     ISThether under such circumstances the Poles would hold with the Austrian Germans or the Magyars, would depend very largely upon the future policy of Germany towards her own Poles, upon the attitude of the Austrian Germans towards the Berlin Alliance, and on how far the domestic current comes to predominate among Poles and Magyars respectively. But quite apart from the introduction of a third partner, the change, would also vitally alter the relative position of Austria and Hungary.     Galicia is far the largest of the seventeen provinces, and the transference of her eight million inhabitants to Poland would reduce Austria to a population of about two millions less than Hungary, and, quite apart from its agricultural
and industrial effect, would completely change the existing proportion of financial burdens and secure to Hungary a certain primacy.     To the Czechs and Jugoslavs of Austria the change would be altogether intolerable, since by removing 120 Slav deputies from the Reichsrat it woud^. place the remaining Slavs in a distinct minority as against the Germans.    But even the Germans (exoept the extreme Jingoes to whose national intolerance this might appeal) do not fail to realise the disadvantages in-herent in a change which would gravely weaken Austria as a whole as against Hungary.At least one ingenious scheme is believed to be under oon-sideration with the object of avoiding these dislocations.    The relation between Austria and Hungary would remain unchanged, and Poland (viz: Russian Poland and Galicia) would become a sort of appendage to Austria only, under a special Personal Union between the Polish and Austrian Crowns: while to make up for this acoeseion of strength to Austria within the Monarchy a similar arrangement would be made for the creation of a unified Southern Slav State depending on the Crown of Hungary and corn-prising, in addition to Croatia-Slavonia, the Austrian province of Daimatia, the jointly-administered province of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the joint conquests of Serbia and Montenegro. So artificial and top-heavy a scheme is open to endless objections: but it is possibly regarded as the highest common denominator between the rival alternatives of preserving Ifcialiem or realising the various programmes of national unity.    The most obvious objection to it is that it ignores the Czechs: but this very fact makes it the more likely to appeal to the two dominant races, who might reckon on their capacity to isolate and hold down the Czeoho-Slovaks, if once the Poles and Jugoslavs had been dealt with.    The Emperor is known to be more sympathetic to the Poles and Jugoslavs than to the Czechs owing to the latter&apos;s intranslgeant
attitude during the war, and it is therefore possible that these feelings might tempt him to lend an ear to the scheme.jUnough is already known of the lines of discussion between Vienna and Berlin to make it clear that Germany&apos;s consent to an Austrian solution of the Polish Question rests upon Austria-Hungary &apos;s readiness to declare her de s in t er e s sement in the fate of Gourland and Lithuania, which are more and more regarded as German preserves.    The obvious assumption is that Germany^ complaisance to the Polish scheme has also been bought by very material economic advantages on more or less &quot;Central liuropean&quot; lines.     It is however rumoured that the German attitude is partly determined by certain highly secret negotiations between Berlin and Vienna, with ramifications reaching to both Munich and the Vatican.     If there is any truth in the story, there has been a revival of designs which undoubtedly existed in the middle of last century and which aimeu at securing for Germany a direct access to the Adriatic at Trieste.Austrian Slav Attacks on Hungary.     The debate to which the Polish proposals gave rise in the Austrian Parliament was the most important and far the most outspoken sinoe the sensation-al declarations of the four Slav groups on 30th Hay last.     It provided the CzechB and Jugoslavs v/ith an opportunity for abuse of Hungary and the Dual System, of which they took the fullest advantage,     Mr. Stanek, the president of the Czech Club, declared that Hungary as fortified by the Dual System &quot;personifies the idea of national barbarism&quot;, and that the truth   about Magyarisation was being concealed from the Emperor by his en-tourage.     Amid loud applause he asserted that &quot;the Hungary of to-day and its national and political system is the second jgreatest obstacle to peace&quot; (he obviously regards Anglo-German
rivalty as the first) and that no peace or recovery of Europe ie possible until &quot;on the ruins of the Dual Monarchy flourishing national States have been erected&quot;.     The Czech Socialist Mr. Soukup, while pleading for Ozeoho-Slovak independence, roundly declared that &quot;no one can expect the Czechs to recognise the Magyar frontiers for all time&quot;: while Father Korosec, President &apos; of the Jugoslav Club, demanded the fall of Dualism and &quot;the ^liberation of the Southern Slavs not only of Austria, but of &quot;Hungary also&quot;.     Other Slav deputies spoke no less openly.Magyar Protests.     Dr. von Seidler, the Austrian Premier, made a breif statement in the course of the debate, but confined himself to vague assurances that the Polish Question could not form an obstacle to peace.    The fact that neither he nor the President of the Relchsrat made any attempt to restrain the attacks upon Hungary or call their authors to order, still less to refute the arguments advanced, has caused immense indignation among the dominant class in Hungary.    The Budapest press is full of abuse of the Czechs, but also of very open attacks upon the Austrian Government.    The comment of Count Tisza - &quot;Is then everything possible in Austria?&quot; -   as also the announcement of his intention during the coming Delegations to refer to these &quot;absurd and impertinent&quot; attacks upon Hungary, were given great prominence.    Jurther public protests came from Count Andrassy and other leading Magyar statesmen.    The semi-official Pester Lloyd expended more than its usual volume of language upon the Czech y/arning that &quot;the Hungarian Government is playing with dynamite&quot;.The whole incident has accentuated the bitter feelings already kindled between Austria and Hungary by the latter&apos;s policy of withholding food supplies from her less well-stocked partner.     It is undoubtedly the resentment at this policy that explains the passivity with which the German parties watched
the Slav onslaughts upon Hungary.The mingled chauvinism, anger and alarm of Magyar political circles has forced Dr. Wekerle to take a strong line.     He had already informed Parliament   last October that he was requestingthe Austrian Minister of Justice to revise the Austrian Criminal Code in such a way as to permit action against all who attack Hungary!s territorial integrity.     It is of course obvious that such a provision will never obtain the sanction of the Austrian Parliament and therefore has no prospect of coming into force. So strong however is Magyar jingo feeling that Dr. wekerle has reaffirmed his intention of pressing for such a &quot;reform&quot;.    The Czech and even part of the Viennese press comments very sarcastic-ally on his prospeots of success.Dr. Wekerle had also stated publicly last October that he had a definite assurance from the Crown, that the Dual System would be fully suspected and that any such constitutional changes as might be introduced in Austria would in no way affect Hungaryls\ territorial integrity.     Since the Reichsrat inoident he has gone much further and now announces that the Crown has premised not merely to maintain the Dual System, but also to preserve inside Austria itself the existing Crownland boundaries.     If this really represents the mind of the Emperor-King and of his advisers in Austria, and is not a mere attempt to commit them in the sense desired by Budapest it can only mean that all serious idea of constitutional reform has been abandoned.    For while the solution of the various national questions cannot be completed without the removal of the Dual System, it cannot even be begun without the regrouping of the seventeen provinces on a racial basis.The controversy is only at its beginning, and there is no possibility of its being allowed to rest, since it strikes at the root of all the national problems which involved Austria-Hungary in this war, and is infinitely complicated by economic considerations.
Dr. Y/ekerle&apos;a Dilemma.     Meanwhile the Eun&amp;arianG-ovemment -remains in a state of latent crisis, and Dr. Wekerle is making every effort to. esoacp^,,-frcm -the deadlookTby the fusion of the governmental groups into a new and.-unifiedjparty.    But there is no escape from the ^diXemma that^the Government can only secure a majority in the present Parliament by compromising on vital principles and thus throw the few really genuine reformers over-board.Czemin&apos;s Peace policy.     An official communique of the flremdenilatt announces that there io no change in the peace policy announced by Count Czernin in his Budapest speech.     This is welcomed by various organs as a reassuring proof that it is not his intention to withdraw the offers which he then made, unless the enemy should accept^h^mjwithin a definite period of time.Reform in Croatia.     Meanwhile in Croatia the Serbo-Croat Coalition is reaping the reward for its abstention from all matters touching on foreign policy, and has been allowed to introduce its own $Tanchise Reform Bill.     The draft is now before the Diet and is very comprehensive.     All males over the age of 24 are to receive the vote; the constituencies are in-creased from 90 to 120: and the ballot is introduced instead of public declaration.    The calculation of the Coalition is that when this measure has once become law, it will once and for all become impossible for the Magyars to manipulate elections in Croatia, as they have so often tried under the old narrow franchise.     The national basis for Southern Slav resistance to Budapest will thus be greatly strengthened, and it will be safe to risk a new trial of strength.Duelling. The ISmperor has issued to the Army a prohibition of the practice of duelling. t/hile this is doubtless in part a concession to Catholic feeling, it also certainly tends to
