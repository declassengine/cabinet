G/2SPECIAL  IMQBAgBMonThe &quot;Flemish Movement&quot;   (Kov.  1. 1917)The so-called Flemish Movement is. for the most part, a demand for legislative reforms regarding the use of the Flemish language. It would, however, be superficial to define it within such narrow limits.     In order to grasp all its manifestations this agitation must fee considered as a complex movement aiming at creating, main-gaining and developing among the Flemish population, within the pol-ltiosl compress of the Belgian State, a Flemish life.     Its principal means of realisation being the affieial organisation, In the Flemish portion of Belgium, of a Flemish linguistic regime.The leaders of the movement believe that, in this way, they will develope the faculties of the Flemings as distinct from the Wall tone.     But it must be distinctly understood that the recognised leaders have no intention whatever of putting any obstacle in the way of the union of the two groups in the political union of the Belgian State.     The movement is in fact, a purely internal one and implies neither any anti-national tendency nor foreign interference.   To those in favour of the movement the reforms to which reference has been made appears the essential oondltion in the general improve-ment which they desire to see in the conditions of the Flemish working-class.    They wish to see that olass,intellectually and economically, on the same level as the Walloon labouring olass. It is possible that the alleged inferiority of the Flemings has been somewhat exaggerated by some of their enthusiastic leaders;
but there is n* doubt an element of truth in their contention that the education of the people can only yield its best results when it is given in their mother tongue aided by an intellectual  lite which sympathises with the movement.It is hardly necessary to say that this ideal has Aothing, even remotely, to do with TeutoniSm.In April 1916, when speaking of the alms of the war the German Chancellor outlined the policy of Germany as regards Belgium as ftllewe :-&quot;We will obtain sure guarantees in order that Belgium shall not become a vassal-state of England and Trance and shall not be used as an economic and military bulwark against Germany.     Germany cannot abandon to Latin influenc the Flemish people which has so long bean under subjection. We shall secure for them a sound development, according to their resources feun&amp;ed on the Flemish language and Oharsoter&quot;.This declaration is the key-note to what has happened and is happening as regards the Flemish movement, and it is well to under-stand tho German view on wfrich it is founded.     Their argument is briefly this.     The Belgian State is merely a politioal abstraction, and Belgium a cenglomeration of peoples stuck together through politioal oiroumstances which in themselves constitu^ a menace to German unity.     By invading Belgium in 1914 the German nafcl on merely hastened a course of events, namely the dissolution of Belgium, whioh in any case was imminent.     The German race oould not remain deaf to the cry of their racial brethren the Flemings.     Let the Walloons go to France and let the Flemings be gathered inte the great Teutonic fold.Heedless to say the German idea has been developed and propa-gatod by the army of unscrupulous professors which the war has shown, even to the most ignorant, that Gormany has ever at her beck

and call.    The propaganda has not neglected neutral countries.   In Belgium itself a Flemish Bureau (Tlamen Ausschuss) has been estab-liehed under the direct supervision of the German authorities. Newspapers skilfully digguised as genuine Belgian periedioals are published in Flemish by this Bureau.     Pre-war polemical pamphletshave been republished as well as cuttings from Belgian pre-warinewspapers and books.   In fact, anything whsch oan accentuate the pre-war want of harmony between the Walloons and the Flemings Is eagerly made use of.    Persons who have carefully followed the German propaganda regarding the Flemish movement state that the vast underground work undertaken by the Germans is almost incredible. Tho question is:   Has all this labour been productive or is it in vain?  Probably, on the whole, their efforts have been labour lost. In July 1915 the leaders of the Flemish movement who had escaped to the Netherlands published a manifesto in which they solemnly renewed the patriotic pledge of the Flemings to Bblgium.     Their colleagues in the cocupied districts signed a similar deolaration.But the German administration was not discouraged.     They aomwwhat changed their tactics.     General von Bissing collected all the demands for reform of the Flemish leaders and published a series of decrees stating that German^ was ready tc satisfy their aspira-tions.    But the Flemings knew better than to fall into the net, and by all means at their disposal they have shown that they will not aooept the realisation of oven tkeir dearest wishes from the op-pressers of their country.One of General von Bissingls decrees, viz. that prescribing the use of Flemish in the official intercourse between the inhabi-feants and the German Administration, it has been materially im-l^asible to resist.     But the transformation of the State University of Ghant into a Flemish.University has been a fiasco owing to the
absence among the Flemings of sufficient professors and studentsready to become the passive instruments of German tyranny.     InFebruary of the present year the leaders of the Flemish movementprotested against the Ghent University decree.     Von Biasing ignoredthe protest, but he could not ignore the attitude of both Professorsand students      As the institution of a^Flemish University at Ghentwas, before tho war, one of the mainjobjeots ef the FlemiBh movement,the conduct of the leaders in thus pretesting would, one would havethought, carried conviction even to the mind of a German General.Von Biasing at onoe proceeded to methods dear to the Teuton heart.He arrested Plrenne, the best known Belgian Historian, andFrederieq, one of the principal authors of the Flemish movement.one ofThe absence of all sense of humour in imprisoning/the men whose main object was to advance what the Germans are seeking to obtain was truly characteristic     It also showed that the Germans were encouraging the movement for their own purposes and in no way out of sympathy for the Flemings.While the above is the official view of the Flemish movement, there seems to be some ground for believing that outside the occupied territory the poison of separation is not altogether devoid of effect.     This is perhaps due to the fact that the population in the occupied region have daily oc^er proof that the movement is instigated by the Germans, while in France and among the Belgians exiles this is less obvious.     It is stated on reliaoe^ authority that during the summer of 1916 a Belgian Military Chaplain was oon-victed of unpatriotic propaganda work among the Flemish soldiers at the front and that something like a mutiny oocurred when he was condemned to be sent to a disciplinary corps.On. Feb. 4th 1917 some two hundred persons, ostensibly on their own initiative, opened a &quot;Flemish National   Congress&quot; at Brussels.
With a somewhat suspicious unanimity and haste this, body addressed a manifesto to the Flemings accompanied by a programme of reform established on the basis of the autonomy of Flanders.     They elected a Council of Flanders and proceeded to depute seven of   their number to go to Berlin and lay before the &quot;German Government tho details o  their scheme.     On March 3rd 1917 they were reoeived by the Chancellor of the Empire.    He dsew attention in hiB speech welooming them to the secular affinity between the two peoples and to tho &quot;via dolorosa&quot; through w^ich the Flemings had passed in history.     In their struggle with the Latin raoes both Germans and Flemings had loarnt that the same roads led to the same objects. The Emperor, he said, had a sincere sympathy with the Flemings and so far as the state of war and military necessity allowed, desired forthwith to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of those whom the deputation represented .    M. Bethmann-Hollweg then proceeded to state that the Governor General of Belgium wa8 studying the problom of how to assist the cultural and economic development of the Flemings with a view to complete administrative separation from tho T/alloons.     The linguistic frontier must as soon as possible separate the two races.It subsequently however transpired that these were no repre-sentative Flemings at all on th s deputation, and that the whole of this particular movement had been engineered by the German Government.Making allowance for suoh isolated acts of treason and for the undoubted existenoe of a number of foolish and hotheaded young men in Belgium whom the Germans have corrupted, the German arguments denying patriotism to the Flemings seems singularly inepjj.     It is stated on good authority (Mr. F. Passelecq, Directeur du Bureau Documontaire 3elge) that 80$ of the men on the Belgian front rsre

He adds that their officers are unanimous in stating that Flemings and Walloons live on tho most friendly terms and show equal courage under fire.General von Bissing is stated to have deolared that the Belgian character was an enigma.    Apparently the whole world can explain tha enigma except the Germans and their accomplices.
