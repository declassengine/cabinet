Storr (Secretary)Tho Committee had-for considerstion the same papers whioh they had before them at their 2nd. meeting.LONG RANGE   (1)     THE CHAIMiN said that the Committee, at tho last OFFENSIVE - Meeting, had gene Into the question of the Command of the QUESTION      Independent Bombing   Operationst but the discussion had OF COMMAND, been adjourned as both Lord. Derby and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were unable to be present at the Meeting,   At tho first Heating of the Committee they had decided on a policy and It was undesirable for tb.3 Committee to depart from any policy whi-oh they had laid down,   At the same time any objections/raised^- or suggestions made, by tho Commanders of our Armies in tho field and of our Fleets at sea must receive their most serious consideration   He thought that as soon, as the Air Bill became law, the independent offensive would be under the new Air. Ministry and consequently it should be distinct from G3neral Trenchari&apos;fs Command.SIR ERIC GEDDSS thought that if the Air Ministry was to come into being at once, then it should take charge of these operations, but it was very, important to fix a date&apos; when such operations would bo controlled by the Ministry:   until that d5*te he was inclined to think that Sir Douglas Haig -and General Trenchard must be permitted to control the Independent Long-range Operations.
-   -9 Q 40SIR WM, ROBERTSOM said that the Committee had decided \&apos;hat the independent Air Force should he under Sir Douglas fcig&apos;s Command,   This decision had been communicated to the  ield-Karshal, whose reply to the War Office (G.T, 379) was before the Committee,(The pertinent extracts from Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s letter in regard to this point were quoted in the Minutes of the previous meeting,)It was obvious that the FieId-Marsfcal must have a Staff Officer to run such operations, ana the point rras whether he should be General Trench arc or another Officer.,   Whatever might be decided by the Committee, he thought .that, in fact, General Trenchard was really the Officer whom Sir Douglas Haig would regard as immediately responsible to him.   As regards the Field-Marshalv s oijection to having a Naval Officer appointed as Second in Commandi the Field-Mr.rsh.al had suggested an alternative arrangement, as he thought that the appointment of an Officer as Second in Command was open to objection both in principle and in practice.   Sir William Robertson thought, however, that the Committee would be quite right to insist on their own recommendation being accepted.SIR ERIC GSILES thought the position of General Trenchard was comparable to that of -Army Germander who issued orders in his own name,LORD DERBY suggested that for the present, at any rate, the Independent Force should he under General Trenchera? but that the Committee should insist upon a Second, in Command being appointed, who should he a Naval Officer.SIR ERIC GEIDSS aareod with the first id art of.0 pro-posal and thought that the Field-Marshal might he informed that, in regard to General Trenchard, Sir Douglas Haig could do as he liked, but this was a temporary measure only until the Air Force came into being, when the long-Range Offensive would be directly under the Air Ministry, and that a date for the assumption of responsibility should he fixed.MAJ.-GEN. SALMOND said that       the Air Force could not become an Independent Force until the 1st July, the follow-ing year.SIR DAVID HENDERSON pointed out that there was to-day a separate Air Force at Oehey5 which must remain as a detachment under General Trenchard for the present.   The responsibility for its operations, however, would fall on the Air P0licy Committee, and he suggested that the Committee should appoint their own Staff Officer, who should serve under Sir Douglas Haig, to watch developments on behalf of the Committee and report from time to time, His own view was that the Air Force would not be in existence before the 1st January.SIR WM. ROBERTSON read extracts from a letter datedf theGer.id &quot;Gaii inenclosing a14th November, from the Chief France to the Secretary to the War Office, statement of the jl% roplanes and engines likely to be available for the formation of long-distance bombing squadrons next year.     The letter strongly recommended
that the-jrailawlrig...actioi.-^lioTild&quot;be taken Jjimiediately i -(a) Reduce the D.H.9 machines on order to the number required to produce and maintain 15 aquadrons and train the necessary personnel:(b) Try the BiH.P. en ;ine in the Bristol Fighter with a view to the rapid production of a fairly good machine with sufficient petrol for fairly long distance work.(c) Press on the designs of the machines and supersede the D.H.9 where necessaryThe letter further suggested tnat General Trenchard and Lti-Col. Newall should proceed to England about the 25th instant to discuss details.The Secretary was instructed to circulate copies of the letter to members of the Committee for their consideration at the next meeting.The CaAIRMAK said that it was very desirable to fix a date a3 soon as possible when the Air Staff should assume control of the Independent Operations,    de thought that the Field Marshal should conduct those   -operations in his own way as long as he was responsible, but when the new Ministry was formed and its arrangements had been completed^ the Independent. Offensive must be under that liinistry.    He thought it would be a good thing if General Trenchard and Colonel Hewall could be present at the next meeting of the Committee.riAJOPi GEN. SAL:WD undertook to let the Secretary know as soon as the date of General Trenchard1s visit was fixed.COi 1S0D0I-I PAINE, in regard to the question of a Second in Command, pointed out that by the time that Officer v/as appointed he would no longer be a Naval Officer, but an Officer of the Air Force.(2)     CO. jIOBOrOii PAI1TE reported that the Royal Naval Air Service was about 400 ratings short a week in its recruiting.   He had asked that they should be permitted to engage, as craftsmen, men of a higher category than B.I. as the latter broke down under any strain.   They had had to extend the period of training of E ratings from 2 months to 6, owing to the inferior class of work-men obtained,   They had a number of boys of seventeen who would not be sent abroad.ILaJOL GEN. 5ALL10NL said that t/ie Loyal Flying Corps wanted 7,800 women,  of whom 1,000 would shortly be available.   He thought an avenue should be left open so that when the Air Force was started, mechanics etc. could be brought over from the Army;    This might require special legal powers.
(a) COMMODORE PAtNE asked; if the Go-vernraent would approve the drafting of boys overseas.   Many boys were being enlisted in both Air Services and the position night be eased if they were made available for foreign service.. It was sometimes necessary also to send out pilots under 19.SIR DAVID HENDERSON said that it was intended to utilize the boys in the R,Fc.C. on Home Service to relievemechanics of full ago, stood that the age limit rating..ho would then go abroad.   He under-of 19 for officers was a Y/ar OfficeLORD DERBY thought that no legislation would be necessary, and further pointed out that the United States were prepared to send over mechanics ir large numbers.SIR DAVID HENDERSON thought that much could be done by exchange.LORD DERBY, Continuing,  said that the United States insisted that their mechanics should be kept separate and that the Ministry of National Service had agreed to thisDROMES.IrANISATION AIRHvICE. &apos;(3) LORD DERBY reported that the question of aerodromes badly needed looking Into.   There was a possibility, unless something were done, that all those whose cc&quot;&apos;:--iruction had been approved would be half completed when the time came and none actually finished.   -He proposed to set up a small interdepartmental Committee under an energetic man to keep the Air Policy Committee in touch with developments.   They had to settle whether they should proceed with the construe--tion of 82 aerodromes at once or whether this number should not be reduced.   All sorts of absurd orders were now being given and drastic action was necessary.  .(4)SIR WM. ROBERTSON reminded the Committee that Sir Douglas Haig had intimated his wish for R.F.C. officers with practical experience in France being allowed to give their views on the new Air Service, before definite d.ecisions were reached as to various matters affecting the Armies.SIR DAVID HENDERSON pointed out that the Air Organisation Committee had started under a considerable disadvantage owing to the fact that for the first two months after it came into being no representative on that Committee had been appointed by the War Office,    He said that he had repeatedly drawn the attention of the various officials at the War Office to this fact without effect,LORD DERBY said that if Sir David Henderson would write him on the subject he would at once institute enquiries in order to ascertain the reason for the delay enfthe part of his Department to appoint representatives of the War Office on the Air Organisation Committee.SIR DAVID HENDERSON undertook to write to the Secretary of- State for War on the subject. .THE CHAIRMAN,  in this connection,  said that heiiai g&apos; sthoTtghv r-here was much to be said for Field Marsha] suggestion that officers of the three services concerned snould be deputed to meet and to thrash out details before tne Air Ministry come into being.-
UBSTITOTIOK(5)   The Committee further considered the possibility p fl.C.0&apos;s and      of training Warrant Officers and Won-Commlssi oned 2$ FOR OFFICERS   Officers as pilots of the larger machines which, at S PILOTS. present, were only entrusted to Officers (Minutes ofthe Second Meeting).-IR POLICY.LORD DERBY reported that satisfactory progress *vas being made in regard to this point .(6)    SIR JOHN JELLICOE stated that, in his opinion, it was most important for the Navy to know exactly what was the policy of the Committee .     At present it appeared doubtful whether the demands made by the Admiralty for naval aircraft would be met .   He thought it essential that the Consulttee should lay down a policy to which the available sources of production should work.   It was impossible for him to formulate a bombing programme unless lie could be certain of setting a sufficient number of suitable machines .COMMODORE PAINE said that all the Rolls-Royce engines had been allocated, until July next year, to&quot;Largo Americas&quot; etc country wenc , everySofar as the resources of this firm was now working to its fullest capacity,   lie urgently supported the suggestion of the First Sea Lord that a definite policy should be laid down at once .   The need for such a policy was demonstrated by the lack of stability shown by the Departments concerned in formulating their demands , the nature of which changed almost every week .   Until some policy was definitely enunciated it was impossible for the Departments to work up x-o any programme .SIR DAVID HENDERSON pointed out that the responsi-bility of deciding priorities of output of aircraft of all kinds rested with the Air Board.LORD DERBY reminded the Committee that if any Departments had reason to complain of the allocations adjudicated by the Air Board, the question could always be referred for final decision to the War Cabinet.MR STAFF -OFFICERS ATTACH-:D TO THE 30MMITTEE.(7)IIR JOHN JELLICOE said that at the previousmeeting the Committee had recommended that two junior Staff Officers to be selected by the Admiralty and the War Office respectively, should be detailed to assist in the secretarial work connected therewith, In order to maintain a close liaison with the two Departments concerned.   He said that, acting on this recommenda-tion, he had brought with him to the Meeting, Commander Williamson, who was the Officer deputed for this purpose by theAdmiraltygointo the question inMilitaryLORD DERBY undertook to consultation with the Director-General of Aeronautics and General Trenchard and to nominate an Officer to represent the War Office, before the next meeting of the Committee.The Committee decided thatTheir next Meeting should&apos;be held as soon as the Director-General of Military Aeronautics had ascertained the date when General Trenchard and Colonel Newall would be able to attend ,2 , Whitehall Gardens , S.W. 17th November, 1917.
