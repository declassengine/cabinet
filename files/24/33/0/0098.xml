SIR GORDON HEWART (Solicitor General) explained that the question was one of expediency rather than of law. A statute does not bind the Crown, unless it is clearly stated to do so. Such a statement could be made in the case of the Munitions of War Acts either by means of a special clause in an amending Bill or by a Bill ad hoc.

SIR THOMAS BELL said the Admiralty did not wish to anticipate any pressure that might be exercised to make the Munitions of War Acts applicable to the Royal Dockyards. The men employed there were well treated; practically every award of the Committee on Production had been given effect to in the Royal Dockyards and in the event of an amendment (such as that of Mr. Hohler see G.T.2556) being brought forward on the next amending Bill, Dr. Macnamara was prepared to risk a defeat on a division.
MR. KELLAWAY felt sure that a defeat would be certain on such an amendment being brought forward; and Mr. Roberts and Sir David Shackleton concurred.

THE ADMIRALTY REPRESENTATIVES emphasised the special nature of the conditions in the Royal Dockyards, especially the rights to pension of "established" men who form 33 and a third per cent of the mechanics and urged that the Dockyard should not be brought within the operation of temporary war legislation such as the Munition of War Acts. They therefore supported the compromise arrived at in the agreement between Dr. Macnamara and Mr. Kellaway (G.T.2656).

MR. BALDWIN was also in favour of the compromise.

THE MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS &amp; MINISTRY OF LABOUR REPRESENTATIVES express themselves generally in favour of the incorporation in the next Amending Bill of an equivalent to Mr. Hohler&apos;s amendment.

On the assumption that the compromise should be accepted, the conference considered the question whether it would be well for the Government to await an amendment (as proposed in G.T.2656) or to put one down themselves ( as advised by Dr. Addison G.T.2691). It was agreed that the better course would be for the Government to put one down themselves, and put the ships on.

MR. BARNES observed that the subject under discussion was a small (but important) section of the large question of unification of Government Departments dealing with labour. He would consult with Lord Milner on the subject in relation to other aspects of the problem.

On the 26th. November, Mr. Barnes saw Lord Milner on the above subject when it was decided to report to the War Cabinet that a clause should be inserted in the next Munitions of War amending Bill, to the effect that the Munitions of War Acts should bind the Crown, without any exception in favour of the Royal Dockyards.
