Clemeaceau has formed his Ministry.met the Chamber, had awarm reception tfrom the whole House except the embarrassed and half-silent Socialists and get a vote of confidence by a majority 6f 418 - 65.    Eie declaration cf policy contained more of the usual Prenoh sonorous generalities than might have been expeoted from a Minister who has coma in as a man of action.    But at made some definite statements;   of which the first is that the Censor-ship will be limited to military and aiplomatio news and to news likely te disturb the peaoe of the country.     This means at any rate that the old system by which, for instance, M. Ribot never allowed any attacks on himself will be abolished;   whether ifr means that full criticism of diplomatic policy, suoh as the tr^Ljr with Italy, for which the Debate pleads, will be allowed, is ait clear.    Apparently the Press Bureau will, as in England, make suggestions and- leave responsibility to the Editors.   The second ie tkat all the aooused in the presenVaffaires&quot; will bo brought before Court Martial, and no $ore pacifist campaigns will be allowed.   The third is that Franco will &quot;follow England, Italy and America in a polioy of food restriojtiens&quot;.   M. Clemenceau, pressed to define his attitude in various matters, not only refused to bind himself by promises, but with characteristic courage went out cf his way to declare himself against international meetings atStockholm and elsewhere, to tell the Socialists that a Society of Nations eould not be formed in en hour or a day, as they seemed toimagine, and to refuse to act as/\&quot;udge in matters which must be left tc -;.Ae Courts.
So far so good.     He has got ever the first difficulty, the more serious part of ehich was not the meeting of the Chamber hut &quot;forming the Ministry.     The three groups of the Extreme Left, the Socialists, the Radical-Socialists andnthe Republican-Socialists formed a ^loc&apos; with ;a view to acting together and making a Clemenoeau Cabinet, or indeed any Cabinet exoept of the Extreme Left, impossible.     But the manoeuvre o&amp;mpletely failed before theffait accompli&apos;.    The Republican--Socialists deolined from the first to ostracise any individual by name, and the Radioal-Sooialists, when some of them were invited te join by M. Cldmenceau, gave their ooh-sent by a large majority.     So the Socialists were deserted.     Their5papers - alone, or almost alene in the Press, for even the Pays ill for giving him a fair trial - attacked E. Cldmenceay^violently, re-calling his diatribes against the Russian revolutionaries and even formerly against Mr, Wilson;   and they threaten to wreck his Cabinet in a few weeks.     The probability appears to be that thay have once more over-reached themselves.     The Gaulois even deolares that it was their veto which made M. Clemenoeau Prime Minister. Perhaps they are beginning to realise their mistake, for 25 of th*ir 96 deputies abstained from voting when the division came.     It is/ Icnewn that M. Clemenoeau tried to get Thomas to Join and that in jthe course of a friendly conversation which they had some little time ago Thomas did not himself reject the idea but said he must consult tfc&apos;p party.    When he did so he found the opposition too strong.    One cannot help moticing that as the Ministry is constituted Clemenceau, who is 76, is Minister of War as well as Prime Minister.     Is thexe-any possibility that he is keeping the former pest at his disposal in the hope of bringing Thomas In later?Meanwhile the oountry, as a whole, as represented by the Press,
and, it is said, even more strongly then the Press, welcomes the man who, in spite of all his faults of temper, in spite of a past .in which he has quarrelled with everybody, was felt to be the man most likely to have the energy and will, so sadly lacking to M. Painleve, so urgently needed for the prosecution of the war, for the control cf the Chamber, and perhaps above all for the fearless probing to the bottom of all the charges ofjtfceason, the relentless punishment of all traitors whoever they may be, and the speedy deliverance of the country from the atmosphere of doubt and suspicion which had hung over it since the first arrests four months ago.It seems that M. Poincare, who hes long been on the worst peo?ible terms with M. Clemenceau, to whom he is said to have given a written premise not to stand fcr the Presidency, first turned to&apos;M. Hene Ranoult, the leader of the E&amp;dical-Sooialiets.    It is to the Presidents credit that on Renoulfs refusal he aa onco allowed a common friend to arrange a reconciliation between himself and Clemenceau, and, though he resented bitterly having to accept,, his rival in the  residential Election as Minister of the Interior, he ultimately gave way on that point also.     M. Pams is a respeotable man of no importance, and, like too manp of the other Ministers is in f&amp;ot, nothing but C16menceauls man.     The Ministry is M. Clemenceau. The Press, which expected more originality, oomplains that the rest are obscurities or the usual &quot;mandarine&quot;.     There are no Socialists in it and no Royalists or members of the Right.     Its most notable figures perhaps ate M- Pichon, who ia Foreign Secretary for the fifth time in his career, M. Klotz, who remains in office as Minister of Finance, and M. Jonnard, who has been Governor-General of Algeria and later Minister for Foreign Affairs under Briand in 1910 but is best known now by his recent action during the crisis of the deposi-tion of the King of the Hellenes.     H. Leygues has been in five
Cabinets before, but perhaps his most remarkable achievment is to have written verses which so pleased a millionaire that he left the hapoy peet an immense fortune.&apos;    M. Jeanneney, who will act as Under Secretary to the Prime Ministers office in the closest relations with him, owes his position chiefly to his intimate friendship with M. Clemenoeau.     The only other names worth mentioningare panhaps are those of M. Lafferre, the new Minister of Education who is the head of the Free-Masons, and M. Sergent the Under Secretary of Finance, vvho is Deputy Governor of the Bank of France and has the reputation of being a man of great ability.     He is not in Parliament.M. Clfemenceau has always been something of an Anglophil and has many English friends.     This attitude and experience will of course &quot;be an advantage to the Alliance.     But it may also produce its difficulties.     Aa Lord Salisbury once said that M. Waddington, just because he was of English origin, had in doing business with ua to be more French than the French, so the French may expect M. Clemenceau having so many English friends to get as much as he can out of England.    Already the Frenoh Press has very generally mis-interpreted Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Paris speech to the extent of making it the basis of a demand for a single Generalissimo of the Allied or at least the Franco-British Armies.     The view that this General-isairao should be a Frenchman is, in French journalistic circles, differing in this,it is to be feared, rather widely from English military opinion, taken as obvious and axiomatic.     One of the worst offenders in this press campaign, as it may almost be called, is unfortunately K. Clemeneeau^ paper which, in An article not of course written by him but appearing after he was Prime Minister, indulges in a number of very disputable assertions in support of its demand for a French Commander in Chief.     It gives the credit of keeping the GermarLS^jcait of the Channel Ports in Nov. 1014 to Foch
vrho   it ;:Ue?e8, was then in command of English as well as French: end it sc..73 not c v:ord of any British General.     It declares, in apparent forgetfulness of the Offensive of Aptil 1917, th.\*t this method (of French Command) has always given the best results.      It declares that the French and Germans stand alone in modern war, ens tirely superior to all other nations;   and that it is the natural role of the French to teach their methods to their Allies and if necessary &quot;to impose them in a friendly way on those who do no  yet understand them &quot;.It is obvious that impertinences of this sort will not improve the spirit of co-operation between the two armies.     It i3 to be hoped, however, that very few copies of the article will find their way to the British Army, and that the emphatic declaration by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that he is &quot;utterly opnosed&quot; to this plan   of a generalissimo will give the whole agitation a much needed quietus.This is the less pleasant side of the French mind.     But perhaps, though we might expect more tact in its expressions, wo cannot be surprised that the French, whose military history is on a much larger scale than ours and whose  rmy has in the past carried its glory all Over Europe, should forget that our Army is now of an importance equal to theirs, and that, that being so, the countrymen of 1&apos;arlborough and V/ellington are not likely to welcome   a foreign command.   The offer, which their journalists make, of handing over the Sea Command to an English Admiral in Chief would be no parallel, even if it were practicable;   for the French Fleet is insignificant compared with ours.     A pleasanter subject is the enthusiastic praise lavished on Mr. Lloyd George and his speech by nearly all the organs of French opinion.     This is by no means solely inspired by the misapprehension above referred to.     The Prime Minister is very
popular in Prance and the courage and tiunzneaa of his speech delighted everyone and provoked eo:noarisons between the French and English oratory , the one so rhetorical, vague and flabby,  the other all nerve and sinew of vail and character.     &quot;Wh-;t lessons of energy&quot;, says the Pays, &quot;are offered to us by the English&apos;1&apos;, and proceeds to instance our small -7ar Cabinet, our tax on war profits, our punish-tment of &quot;profiteers&apos;, and other things.Now that France has got a man to lead her, a man who, as he showed in his reply on Tuesday night, can cpeak with a force and frankness like that of Mr. Lloyd George himself, there seems very little doubt that the country will rally with something approaching unanimity to his call for courage and endurance.     It is tired of the war, of course, - every body is in all countries - but a longing for peace does not, in France even more than in England, mean a willingness to accept any peace but the real and permanent one.     So far as can be judged, that is also the feeling of the Army.     The men are impatient with politicians who visit the front and make speeches about their joy in giving their lives for their -country.     They even hissed the President on one occasion.     They have no particular desire to die for their country and they want to get back to their homes and their private affairs.     But they will hold on so long as it is necessary. A very intelligent Anglophil Frenchman, who has served in the ranks both in the Infantry and in the Aviation Corps, has lately told one of our correspondents that the more educated men, who are chiefly in the Artillery and the Air Services, are very impatient with the politicians and are apt to say that if they had done their work as well as the soldiers there would have been peace before this.     He believes the Infantry, who are mostly peasants and rather inarticulate, will go on fighting to the end provided that their wives are all right and can keep the farms going.     He never came across any
organised pacifist propaganda in the *.rmy; and does not believe there is much pacifism or extreme opinion of   any kind.     But he thinks Cl menceau&apos;s reputation for the violent handling *f strikes may arouse suspicion, and he believes that :i strikes ocurred and strikers were shot the Army might do anything, even march on Paris.     His opinion on all these matters can only be taknn for what it is worthi and with reference to his last assertion information reaches us that there were attempts at sabotage in munition works last Friday, got up probably to frighten Clemenceau out of office:   but he showed no fear of the saboteurs and no doubts of the troops.    He told the leaders he would send troops, and they collapsed at once.     One other curious statement made by this French soldier as to opinion in the Army is that though he has been in the Army since 1914 and has been moved about from one corns to another a great deal he has never heard one soldier say he cared a button about Alsace-Lorraine.     They say fchey are fighting to&apos; get the Germans out of France, and when they have done that they will have   no further interest in the war.     There i seemg to be three things to be said about this interesting and \ .surprising statement.     First it can hardly mean nothing, but how much it means is impossible to say without knowing the man.     People commonly hear what they wish to hear and do not hear what they don&apos;t. Second,the soldiers con hardly judge what their feelings would be if they had turned the Germans out of France: victory is not the most easily satisfied of experiences.     Thirdly private soldiers are not likely to realise how possible it is that, if the Germans had been driven out of France and Belgium, there might be no need to do any more.   They might prove to be only too thankful to give Alsaoe-Lorrair and several other things to save themselves from being driven any further.   Anyhow if, as the writer asserts and other evidence confirms him, the moral of the Army is all right to-day, its attitude in the day of victory can be left to take care of itself.
