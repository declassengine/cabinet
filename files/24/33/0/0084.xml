The maximum quantity of coal we have ever indicated that we could ship in British vessels to Italy, and that on condition that she should maintain her ore shipments fully was 300 000 tons of which the British vessels in Italian control normally sufficed for about 100,000 tons leaving 200,000 tons for vessels directly loaded &quot;by us .The Italians have diverted a large &quot;block of coal/ore tonnage (already over 100,000 tons and this is rising up to some 300,000 tons) and this would bring our obligation down considerably through the loss of ore.We have, however, arranged to ship this month nearly 250,000 tons, representing an increase of about .50,000 tons in addition to waiving any withdrawal because of the loss of oreThe Italian diversions both of Italian        Neutral and British vessels under their control have resulted in the total shipments this month coming down to about 380,000 tons.This is in spite of the fact that we are diverting about 120,000 tons of British wheat to them.The American &quot;Government are also allotting a.bout 135,000 tons d.w. to the Italians, presumably largely for wheat.   We have enquired by cable but have no reply yet as to allocations.%e are arranging for f0Ur veesele -cUw, tons CONISTON 4,700JASON ; 10,000PALM BRANCH 5,, 000PSARLMOOE 5,000which are ready to load this week, to be allocated to Italy as an emergency measure.     This is being done at the expense cf our own Depots in the Mediterranean.   In addition 42,000 tons are also being allocated this week, and this represents all the tonnage at our disposal after the absolute minimum requirements of the other services in the Mediterranean have been met..The above steps should raise the shipments to over 400,000 tons which is about the average for the first seven months of this year.It is hopeless for the Italians to expect that the effect of sudden diversions by them without consultation and without allowing for the considerable American allocation can be cured within the month.French diversions offer little scope.   The great bulk ol French civilian coal goes by small vessels unavailable for Italy.Ministry of Shipping,27th November,, 1917
