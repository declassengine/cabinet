EKIIMPTIOW FROM MILITARY SERVICE OF SHIPYARD LABOUTIHRS IN CANADA.Admiralty Memorandum for the V/ar Cabinet.The passage of the Conscription Bill ill Canada renders it necessary that special consideration should be given to the case of porkers in shipbuilding and allied trades in Canada if the work of shipbuilding&apos;in that country is not to be seriously prejudiced.His Majesty&apos; s Government have made contracts which should result in the delivery before the end of the year 1918 fron Canadian Shipyards of35 steel merchant ships - 100,000 tons, 45 wooden, merchant ships-   83,500 tons.In addition to&quot;the above ships contracts were placed in Canada in February last for the delivery of :-100 drifters   - 10,000 tons. 60 trailers   - 16,500 tons.Schemes for a considerable extension of shipbuilding are now under discussion which it is h^ped will result in the delivery during 1919 of 66 stuel&quot;ships (208^000 tons) and wooden steamers amounting to 162,500 tons.Besides steamers building to British account in Canada there are building to Neutral account 9 steamers (47,000 tons)   which on corrpletion will, it is understood,   be time-chartered by His Majesty1 s Government for tho period of the war and six months after it.The fact that the United States Government will probably retain all vessels ordered by us in the United States makes the full development of shipbuilding in Canada all the more important, and it is vital that nothing should be done which would have the effect of restricting the output of the Canadian Yards.It is therefore suggested as essential that exemptions under tho Canadian Conscription Act should be granted to skilled workers in shipyards, marine engine shops and allied trades and to such proportion of unskilled workers as may be necessary to ensure the rapid progress of the work, and it is proposed that representations to this effect should be made officially to the Canadian Government,The matter is referred to the War Cabinet with a view to such representations being made with tho full authority of His Uajesty^ Government.n 1h i(Signed),   2.
