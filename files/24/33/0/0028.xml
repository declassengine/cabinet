The losses of British, Allied and Neutral ships and the serious failure of the French and Italian harvests this year have created a tonnage situation of great gravity,.   The position may be-briefly summarised as follows :-Great Britain during the war has lost about 10 million tons d.w. by war and marine risks.    She has lost net (after allowing for both building and captured ships) about 4 million tons d.w.    Taking world tonnage as a whole the gross losses may be taken at about 17 million tons d.w. and the net losses at nearly 9 million tons d.w.    Of these losses more than half have occurred during this year, some 9 million tons d.w, being lost already this year without allowing for vessels seriously damaged. (Detailed tables of losses are appended).Excluding vessels unsuitable for ocean-going trade, it may be said that the total world tonnage now amounts to about 45 million tons d.w.    Of this about half is British:   of the remainder about 3/5ths is Allied and 2/5ths Neutral.In a telegram sent to America in September, it was estimated that world building would overtake losses if America could build 6 million tons gross, or say 9 million tons d.w. per annum.    This estimate was based upon the experience of this year and made some allowance for marine loss, for obsolescence and for serious damage to vessels not actually sunk;     it was nothoweverIQTI.Tonnage throughout this memorandum is, in accordance with American custom, given in deadweight, except in the calculations of the tonnage for the American Army ?/here the tonnage is given in gross in view of the large proportion of vessels of a passenger type for which d.w. figures are misleading.
however designed to do more than overtake losses,i.e. it would not compensate for past losses or for future losses before the new programme matured. Since than losses have somewhat declined, but on the other hand the British building programme which it was then hoped might reach 4 million tons d.w. will it is probable, not produce more than 2f million tons d.w.   On the whole 6 million tons gross or 9 million tons d.w. is still suggested as the best standard for America to take.   It was explained in that telegram that the reason why it was impossible for Great Britain and the European Allies to build on such a scale as that suggested for America was that in the early stages of the war the immediate necessity was to increase armies,navies and munitions and the Allies&apos; strength has therefore been committed in these directions.   A much smaller effort directed to ship-building would have enabled them to outbuild submarine des-truction even at the present rate.   Fortunately it was just when merchant shipping became as vital a factor as armies,navies and munitions, that America, whose industrial and engineering re-sources are the greatest in the world, entered the war.As compared with the 6 million tons gross or 9 million tons d.w. America is said to be contemplating a programme of about 6 million tons d.w.   The actual programme forwarded to us, however, only provides for about 5 million tons d.w.The situation has been rendered still more difficult from the British point of view by the fact that nearly 900,000 tons d.w. of shipping which the British Government had ordered in America has been requisitioned by the American Government. This tonnage (allowing for delivery dates) would have had an importing capacity of about 2 million tons in 1918 and would have enabled Great Britain to give additional assistance to theAllies
A *38Allies to that extent.    It will be recognised that but for the foresight of the British Government in ordering these vessels early in* this year and many months before the American Government Shipbuilding organisation had been completed, the output of American yards this year and early next would presumably have been much less than it now will be.Great Britain is now providing France and Italy with over 2 million tons d.w. of British tonnage in addition to over i million tons d.w. lent to Hussia, the total for all Allies being about 3 million d.w.   This tonnage, if withdrawn into British service, would suffice to keep Great Britain&apos;s imports next year up to her imports for this year, so that the general position is that her tonnage is sufficient in spite of losses to maintain her own part in the war.   The difficulty arises through the necessity of helping the Allies in siite of those losses.   It is,however, obviously impossible for Great Britain to withdraw her tonnage from the Allies.   On the contrary, she is, in view of the extreme gravity of the position, endeavouring so to restrict even her essential imports next year as to enable her to continue her present assistance to her Allies, to replace British vessels lost in their service and also to provide tonnage sufficient . to help in meeting the increase in their cereal requirements through bad harvests, the latter meaning the conveyance of over 2 million extra tons and requiring a further tonnage of about 750,000 tons d.w.   If this should prove possible, however, it will only be at the most serious cost to this country.   If no further assistance be given to the Allies, British imports next year would be reduced from about 34 million tons to about 28 million tons (excluding oil fuel for Admiralty in both cases).    In considering these figures itmust
13A 4.must be remembered that British imports of food (which are capable .of little reduction) amount to about 15 million tons, that over 11 million tons consist of ore and munitions, and that a large proportion of the remaining imports are required for war purposes.   As compared with these figures, her pre-war imports amounted to about 54 million tons.   That is her imports, excluding food and munitions, which amounted to over 36 million tons in peace times, have this year fallen to about 6 million tons;   and 6 million tons must, as stated above, be taken partly off this figure and partly off the food and munitions requirements for next year even $$art from the con-veyance of the further 2 million tons: of cereals for the Allies-It is necessary to emphasise the fact that if in spite of the above facts and of the loss of the British ships building in America Great Britain is able to realise this programme, it represents the most extreme assistance it is conceivable that she can give and that it may be impossible to give assistance to this extent.Of about 27 million tons d*w. of British ocean-going tonnage at the beginning of the war, we have sustained a net loss of about 4 million d.w.    A further million tons is in the Yards for small and big repairs.    About 5 million d.w. tons are required for direct Army and navy services apart from indirect requirements such as munitions and about 3 million tons d.w. are in the service of the Allies.    Excluding vessels which are unsuitable for general work or are required for essential supplies of the Colonies, this leaves only some 9l million tons d.w. for importing work.     In order to make this contribution to the war, Great 3ritain has had to sacrifice her shipping interests, whole Linos built up formany
many years being completely destroyed,e.g. the Irince and Booth Lines between North and South America.   She has had to sacrifice her export trade, exports only being allowed so far as there is space available in outgoing ships sent to bring back essential imports.    She has already had to impose severe hardships on civilian interests, the use of petrol being for instance stopped for pleasure traffic, oats not being allowed except for horses engaged in essential work, and the supply of cotton for the main British industry in Lancashire being reduced to 60 per cent.    The further programme contemplated for next year will go far beyond this and will involve some industrial disaster and the absolute cutting off of many articles of foodstuffs ordinarily regarded as essential.In spite of these measures, there must,however, still be a serious deficit in the tonnage required for absolutely essential French and Italian requirements through the fact that France and Italy as well as ourselves have, had serious losses during this year.   France&apos;s own statement of her deficit of tonnage is about If million tons gross or 2,400,000 tons d.w. or 6 million tons of imports, which would still leave a deficit .of over 4 million tons after allowing for the extra assistance for cereals contemplated as above by Great Britain. It may, however, be perhaps fairly assumed that France could carry on if she had sufficient tonnage (in addition to that given by Great 3ritain for her increase in cereal demands) to keQp her imports for 1918 up to those for 1917 i.e. to compensate for the reduction in the carrying power of vessels under her own control through losses.   This means additional tonnage sufficient to carry some 2  million tons of imports in theyearMote.   Statements shewing the present disposition of British French and Italian tonnage are enclosed.
year or say 750,000 tons d.w* continuously employed.   Italy on a similar basis would require tonnage for some It million tons of imports or say 500,000 tons d.w.   This extra tonnage, amounting to some 1-j million tons d.w. can only be provided from American tonnage or from extra neutral tonnage ( in addition to what is not in war service and the vessels to replace future losses).   This figure (which is less than half the aid Great Britain proposes to give in spite of the loss o the vecsels building in America and would mean a contribution by America of only some -g- million tons in addition to those vessels) must be-taken as a low figure which would still involve very considerable hardship and risk for France and Italy as well as for Great Britain.It is suggested that America should aim at providing for an average continuous employment for France and Italy or for Great Britain (which would thereupon give equivalent tonnage to France or Italy) not less than If million tons d.w. excluding oilers .ind meeting her own military requirements with the balance.     It is hoped that \ million tons of this can be given at once, and the rest providedas
142A 7.as the American shipbuilding programme develops.The tanker position is somewhat different, Great Britain has throughout made it clear that,   while she could transport her own supplies although not all the Allies1 supplies without assistance, she had insufficient tank Vessels for the supply of oil fuel to the IJavy,     In consequence of this deficiency, it has been necessary to use the double bottoms of ordinary cargo vessels (to the extent of about 100,000 tons a month)   to carry oil fuel, which is uneconomical and means delay and the loss of an equivalent weight of ordinary cargo.    America,however, is relatively rich in tank vessels and in arranging to give additional ordinary tonnage to her Allies in spite of her own serious position Great Britain hopes that America will find it possible to provide, by requisitioning from commercial employment, sufficient extra tankers to make up the deficit and to reader nr.necessary the continued use of double bottoms.    Full particulars of the oil fuel and tanker position have been given to the American Government..hat is urgently needed is the immediate provision of 100,000 tons dcW. of tanker tonnage with a further addition of 200,000 tons d.w. as soon as possible.In considering the possibility of America accepting this position, it is necessary to take into account the American military requirements on the one hand and on the other the tonnage at her disposal now and during next year.Official information just received from the American Government states tho  American position at present to be as follows.
There is a total of 539 vessels under American Registry over 2500 tons d.w. aggregating 3,620,320 d.w. of which tankers represent 1,052,253.     As against this the Navy has (excluding tankers) 30 vessels aggregating 151,509 d.w. tons.     The Army has 103 of 848,894 d.w. tons, 48 vessels of 308,719 d.w. tons have been allotted to Allied Governments and 81 vessels of 501,705 d.w. tons are in private trade in the war zone.    American requirements for necessary supplies are estimated at 2-jj million tons d.w. excluding tankers, representing a considerable increase from the former figures which shewed a requirement for&quot;if million tons d.w. for imports from the Par East and from South America,It is stated that there are no vessels now capable of being withdrawn from present trades, and the American tonnage shortage on the above figures is given as 1^ million tons d.w. without counting about 1 million further tons which are being asked for by the Allies.The above figures of course do not include the small vessels under 2500 tons d.w*- which are presumably available to help in coastwise work, nor sailing vessels available for the same purpose.     Nor do they include neutral vessels employed in American waters of v/hich there are believed to be some f million tons d.w. mainly Norwegian.     In addition the Eastern imports can presumably be largely carried in Japanese tonnage of which it is understood something like 500,000 tons d.w. might be available.     In addition there is the possibility of bringing into employment refugee neutral tonnage that is now idle In American Ports which Is understood to amount to some   J to f million tons d.w.        There are also possibilities of interned vessels in South America being brought into use.     Beyond this there is, of course, the American new buildings.     By the 1st April this should, according to the present programme, give an extra million
rtons d.w.     Later the situation should improve rapidly, as new building from April to June should give a further l  million tons and from July to September a further l  million tons d.w. and from October to December a further lj million tons d.w.Some reference may also be made to British experience in connection with the statement that no ships are capable of being withdrawn from their present trades. This of course must be for America to decide and Great Britain has no desire, nor the necessary information, to criticise the estimate upon which this conclusion has been formed.     It may be useful to remark, however, that one of most remarkable things Great Britain has learnt In the war is the extent ibo which it Is possible, without absolute disaster, to cut off requirements that on first careful investigation appeared to be absolutely essential. Great Britain is more dependent upon imports than any other of the main belligerents.    She has to import 4/5ths of her wheat and In peace times imports nearly 20 million tons of foodstuffs a year.     Under the strain of the war, however, her Imports haves,, as stated above, bo en reduced from some 36 million tons excluding foodstuffs to some 8 million tons excluding foodstuffs and munitions and this figure must again be reduced for next year.     It was never anticipated earlier in the war that a reduction so drastic would be possible.     It is experience alone which has shewn that a country which (like America) has a large civilian consumption and (unliko America) is hampered by an inadequate home producing capacity could bear so big a strain. A careful examination by the British Government of the 50 million tons of imports coming in earlier in the war showed that only a little over 2 million tons were regarded as non-essential.     In  act, however, the determination to
continue her increased naval and military operations and to continue her assistance to the Allies has resulted in the immense further reductions shorn above and though there has been hardship and inconvenience there has so far been no actual disaster.     There are, of course, a very great number of imported articles which are both required for military purposes and are also used for civilian consumption.     The only practical way which Great Britain has found of economising tonnage in these circumstances is to start by actually withdrawing ships so ruthlessly that those left are quite inadequate for normal civilian consumption.     In the more important cases such as steel it has been found necessary to prevent any civilian consumption except through a specific licence given only on the ground that the proposed use was essential in the national interests.     It is suggested that in a similar way America might find some of the wool which she requires for military purposes by obtaining it from the wool cof.su.red by her large civilian population.     Nothing has been more strikingly shewn in the war than that civilian requirements can adjust themselves to reduced supplies when the necessity actaally arises through the withdrawal of vessels for military service to a very much greater extent than the best experts considered possible beforehand(     It may be hoped therefore that America will find that some further vessels than she now thinks possible may be rendered available from private employment for war services and the total tonnage shewn as above as available for the latter purpose may be increased accordingly.Against this tonnage there are the American requirements stated above, plus the additional Allied requirements also stated, a necessary provision to meet losses and above all the increased needs of the Army.
The needs of the Army are extremely difficult to calculate as the exact composition of American divisions, and the way in which they will be transported are unknown, and the provision for reinforcements and for hospital ships, which must of course depend upon casualties &amp;c, is in any case very speculative.It may be said generally that it takes 4 gross tone of shipping to transport a man. 8 gross tons to transport a horse or mule, and to supply one man from America would require 1 gross ton perpetually employed.       These figures, however, make no allowance for hospital ships, reinforcements &amp;c.A memorandum is attached showing the vessels required for different military programmes.     It has been ascertained to-day that much more exact information is now available as to the American arrangements.     A more precise statement Is now being prepared and will be substituted for this estimate which must be regarded as very hypothetical.     It will be seen on the assumptions that (1) wastage of personnel will occur at roughly 8^;- per month or 100$ per annum.(2) wastage of forces will occur at roughly Z\% per month or 30$ per annum, and(3) wounded or sick would be retained in Prance and only the permanently disabled men repatriated to America, the following tonnage 7/ould be required on different military programmes :-(The estimate Is designed to show the tonnage required to transport maintain and supply a given force, commencing Dec 1st 1917.     It does not take into account the numbers already transported, (a) if 400,000 men (including non-combatants L.of C. troops etc.) &amp; 70,000 horses in Prance by 30th April 1918, are to be in France by the 30th April 1918, the tonnage required would rise from about 1 million tons gross to 1,527,500 tons gross on the 30th April.    If no addition tfere then made to the force 544,500 tons gross would be sufficient to maintain the force and provide reinforcements.
(b) In order to have 800,000 men in France by the 30th September (including non-combatants L.of C. troops etc) and 140,000 horses) the tonnage instead of being reduced after the 30th April would rise gradually until by the 30th September it reached 2,072,000 gross tons.     If the force were not thereafter Increased, 1,089,000 gross tons would suffice to maintain the force and transport reinforcements.(c) If the force were thereafter increased to 1 million by the 31st December, 1918, (including non-combatants L*of C, troops,etc) and 175,000 horses, the tonnage instead of declining after the 30th September would increase till it reached 2,341,000 gross tonson the 31st December, the tonnage thereafter required for maintenance and reinforcements, if no further addition to the total force were made, being 1,358;000 gross tons.It is apparent from the above figures that with the tonnage immediately under American control and with her requirements as at present stated, America can scarcely do more than provide about I million tons d,w. for the Allies in the immediate future without definitely limiting her military expedition.     If, howewer, she can bring into use the neutral tonnage now lying Idle or out of war work, can meet her Eastern requirements with Japanese tonnage and can reduce her import requirements, e.g. by restricting civilian consumption, there is a reasonable hope that she could provide France and Italy with the minimum tonnage they require as described above and also make her military programme on the basis of having 1 million men in France by the end of next year with the aid of her new building.     Any such estimate, however, must necessarily be very hypothetical and to secure any margin it would be necessary that America should expedite building to the utmost possible extent and if possible raise the rate of output to the 9 million tons d.w. per annum previously suggested.X    The tonnage is given in gross tons as it is misleading tocalculate in d.w, where a large proportion of the vessels are of the passenger type.
Form of Co-operation between the Allies.The objects to be secured are of course(a) to make the most economical use of tonnage under the control of all tho Allies.(b) to allot that tonnage as between the different needs of the Allies in such a way as to add most to the general war effort and(c) to adjust the programmes of requirements of the different Allies in such a way as to bring them within the scope of the possible carrying power of the tonnage available.To secure these objects an International Board with complete executive power over common pool of tonnage had been proposed, but has been rojected for the following reasons :-It would be difficult for any country and particularly for America or Great Britain to deleg ate absolute power to dispose of its tonnago (which is the basis of all its civilian and military requirements) to a representative on an International Board on which he might be outvoted.    Such a Board moreover would not lead to administrative efficiency partly because the complete control of all tonnage can scarcely be well concontrated in one placo and partly because representatives upon it would tend to be at once out of touch with the actual administrative executive machinery and at the same time scarcely invested with sufficient authority to make reductions in the various supply programmes, munitions, food, &amp;c.It must be romembered that the problem of the allocation of tonnage is largely a problem of securing that the different requirements which make demands upon tonnage should be adjusted in the fairest and best way, and- that these requirements can only be so restricted by the experts in each olass of commodities. It is for instance impossible for any except the munitions expertsof
of the different Allied countries to deal with the restriction of the Allied munitions programmes within specified limits. In view of the above considerations the following principles were agreed on November 20th(a) That   America, France, Italy and Great Britain should all tabulate and make available to each other a statement showing in detail and as nearly as possible in tho same form each class of requirements for which tonnage is needed and secondly the tonnage now available and likely to be available in future through new building &amp;c.   Theso requirements having been classified (shewing the source of supply &amp;c.) and having been adjusted (l) to secure a reasonably uniform standard of adoquacy both as between classes of commodities and as between countries, and (11) to bring the total within the carrying capacity cf the Allies as a whole, would form the basis on which the general allocation of tonnage wouldbe determined.    The calculation would bo revised at convenient intervals in the light of losses, nev; building, war requirements and other factors in the problem;   hit it would be an essential feature of the sefneme that subject to such periodical reallocation each Nation should manage and supervise the tonnage under its control.(b) That all four countries should agree that the neutral and interned tonnage obtained through any channel and by whatever country should be used in such a way as to increase by an equal extent the tonnage in direct war services, the extra tonnage being allotted so far as practicable to the most urgent war need of any of the Allies.    The method of allocation must be worked out later, but it is important that the principle should te recognised that it is urgency of war needs and not the Method by which the tonnage has been obtained that should be the criterion.(c) f
(c) Steps to be taken to bring into war service all possible further tonnage, such as in South America, &amp;c. &amp;c.(d) Control over cargoes carried to be such as to ensure that they satisfy the most urgent war needs in respect of which the tonnage has been allotted.It is the intention in carrying out (a) and (b) above that Allied bodies for the different main requirements for food, for munitions and for raw materials should be formed on the model of the i/heat Executive, and it is hoped that America will be associated with these bodies.It is at the same time absolutely essential that for the proper interchange of views and information about the tonnage situation there should be an American representative in this coun-try as there arc already French and Italian representatives, who would act in the same capacity here as Sir Thomas Eoyden does for us in America.It may be convenient to add a short summary of the main conclusion indicated in this Memorandum and certain tables giving certain statistics in greater detail.
A rSUMMARY.The conclusions which appear to follow from tho above statement and from the recent discussions between American, French, Italian and British representatives are (1)   That America should aim at building at the rate of 6 million tens gross (i,e. 9 million tons d.w.) not 6 million tons dcw. per annum. (2)   That it is cf ertrerr.3 importance that she shouldsupplement the assistance .^iven to France and Italy by Great Britain by providing at least jt million tons d.w. i the immediate future and by raising this figure to an average of at least li million tons (including more than   million tons of British ships building in America.) (3)   That this is only possible without limiting her military effortj if she (a) takes every possible step to bring into war service neutral and interned vessels now idle or out of war service (b) obtains the maximum assistance from Japan (c) reduces her own requirements of imports (e.g. by restricting civilian consumption) and requisitions drastically from her own trade along the lines already adopted by Great Britain. That if she takes these steps, however, there is a prospect of her being able to transport and maintain an American Army of 500,000 by the early summer and of 1 million later in the year. (4) That Great Britain in promising further assistance to the Allies to meet their increased cereal demands, in spite of the loss to herself of the British vessels building in America, has done so in the hope that America will help with additional tank tonnage to the extent of rendering unncessary the further uneconomical use
of double bottoms in British cargo vessels for oil fuel for the Navy (100:C00 tons a month).   It is hoped that America will take steps to provide sufficient tank tonnage for this purpose and to meet the deficit in stocks by requisitioning tankers from their present commercial employment, 100,000 tons d.w. being immediately required and a further 200,000 as soon as possible. (5)   That America shomld, like ourselves, accept the principle that neutral and interned tonnage obtained through any channel and by whatever country should be used in such a way as to increase to an equal extent the tonnage in direct war services, the extra tonnage being allotted so far as practicable to the most urgent war need of any of the Allies.(6)   That in order to secure the necessary co-ordination and economy in the use of tonnage, America should appoint a permanent representative who can confer with the British, French and Italian Shipping offieialain London  as Sir Thomas Royden confers with the American Shipping Board,An International Shipping Board is not considered either desirable or practicable.   It is recognised that neither the American nor the British Government would be willing to delegate to such a Board the final allocation of their respective ships, and that the management of American and British ships cannot be centralized in one place. At the same time it is of vital importance that there should be the fullest possible interchange of information and views such as can only be obtained through the presence of an American representative in this country and a British representative in America.(7)   That the machinery for effecting the necessary economicsin all the various commodities requiring transport is..........-------- ... . ........./provided
provided through Allied Committees for each main class of commodity consisting of exports in that commodity.   That Committees should therefore be formed in London for other foodstuffs, for munitions and for raw materials on the model of the Wheat Executive; and that in view of the close relation of the work of such Committees with the general tonnage position and with American policy in the provision both of ships and commodities, appropriate American representatives should be associated with these Conmiittees. T%e following Tables are attached;-(1) Vessels sunk since the beginning of the War. (2) British Vessels sunk during 1917. (3) Present Employment of British Tonnage. (4) Approximate Disposition of Italien national Tonnage. (5) Disposition of French Steamships on 1st. June 1917. (6) Estimate of Tonnage required for American Military Requirements.Note . It will be realised that this memorandum has been prepared in order to elucidate the tonnage position and does not imply any view as to the extent of American Military assistance which i3 desirable.
