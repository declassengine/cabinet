is Document is mei    PENSIONS to WID&quot;&apos;-2S and DEPENDANTSof men shutvr cowardice.Extract from letter addressed to Mr. Barnes by theMinister of Pensions. ******************&quot;I welcome the sympathetic treatment accorded to these unfortunate widown and dependants.    At the same time I should have been glad to present a Minute to the War Cabinet had the opportunity of doing so been afforded me.In consequence of numerous representations frco public bodies, mainly Poor Law Guardians, the Question of provision for these poor people had for several days been engaging the earnest attention of my advi3er3 and myself, and I had alio^d, deoided, as a result, to make certain recommendations.The question. as to whether the dependants of pen who meet their death in these ci ^o instances shonlc1 hare ths :-,an:e recognition ss the Be of -Lsn who die figating for their jcrr..tvrities, bubis one primarily for the IfoTSl anc1 Military Autbo. from the aspect- which most directly affects this department, viz:- that cf administration, I should hare preferred to have created a distinction which, while not placing any dependant of a man shot for cowardice at any monetary disadvantage as compared with other dependants, would have established beyond doubt that pensions as cuch are a rev:&apos;a?-d for ser ^ioe and not merely grants paid in compassion to the relatives of a de-ceased soldier.
Ly idea wa3 to sanction compassionate grants &quot;through the agency of the Special Grants Committee in all these cases, the amount of these grants being just slightly less than those awarded to the widows and dependants of our heroes.I venture to put this forward as an alternative.    I think it has not only the merit of satisfying the necessi-tics of the case, but also the greater merit of discrim:na-ting between the man who deserts at the supreme moment and the one who prefers to make the supreme sacrifice rather than to risk national humiliation as a consequence of his c owa rdly co nduct 11
