MEMORANDUM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER. &apos;1 recently submitted to Lord Milner!s Committee aprogramme of imports of foodstuffs in 1918 totalling 13*056,000 tons.   This is 3^000,000 tons less than the estimated imports in 1917, and I made it a condition that I should have absolute priority both in tonnage and finance over all other needs up to this amount-.A failure either of tonnage or of finance makes the adequate feeding of the civilian population of the United Kingdom in 1918 impossible.I now submit, accordingly, a summary statement of the estimated amount of money required to pay for the necessary imports of foodstuffs into this Country, omitting cereals which are dealt with separately.The total amount shown Is 265,000,000 distributed roughly as shown in the attached table.To this total oaf money required must be added about  20,000,000 for foodstuffs (excluding refrigerated meat) required for tho forces abroad and not imported Into this country.   A further addition should be made to cover losses at sea yielding a total of about  300,000,000 altogether which corresponds to my restricted tonnage demand.
I desire particul&amp;rl^-to-emphatfi&amp;e the-fact^ that it is necessary that I should be reasonably sure that this money will be forthcoming.     It is impossible to do business in North America or anywhere else under the conditions as to finance now ruling,   I may refer, as an illustration only,to the difficulties that have arisen in regard to the supply of bacon, the shortage of which has already caused considerable unrest.     Bacon is not only a foodstuff of the highest possible value for the civilian population, but is regarded as an essential part of the Army ration.    Yet the whole of our purchases in the States (which is by far the most important source of our present supply) have been at a standstill since November 10 through lack of money. This stops supplies not only now but in the future because the packers will not  mite , bacon suitable for our market unless they are assured cf a sale. I have asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to provide 36,000,000 dollars for purchases of bacon in the States up to the end of the year? This is our minimum requirement.     The Chancellor finds himself unable to provide anything at all before the end of December, but has offered me 5,000,000 dollars to be paid after January.

The co-ordinated buying which we are doing has greatly helped the Exchange., and it seems to me unreasonable for the Treasury to take the line that they eannot finance my necessary purchases.It is impossible for me to carry on the work of Pood Control under these conditions.MINISTRY OP FOOD.27th November, 1917.RHONDDA.
