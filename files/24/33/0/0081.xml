/This Document is the Property ofColonel JonesHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]338From Viceroy, 21st November 1917. (Repeated to Tehran.) (Received 22nd November, 10.30 a.m.)Secret. Bushire-Shiraz trade route. Cox&apos;s telegram dated 10th November,.&quot; Have discussed matter(s) with Trevor while here.&quot; Position is that at present considerable amount of traffic is passing from Bushire to Shiraz via Shief, Angali, Shahbankar and Daliki, by which route the districts of the hostile Khans are avoided. Except therefore as regards Soper consignment the route question is not at the moment pressing. We cannot help thinking that notwithstanding any intimation which we may make personally to Farman Farma reserving our freedom of action we shall nevertheless in practice be tied by his proceedings and negotiations with the Khans.&quot; I may mention that I have just received a letter from Darya Begi, in which he writes that behaviour of Zair Khadhir and Shaikh Hussein continues to be so intolerable that unless he can be allowed and assisted to take some action against them he proposes to defer action and come to Bagdad. It appears that the said Khans, not content with preventing villages down coast from paying revenue have now sent threatening letters to headmen of villages of Bushire Island, for instance, Hallila and Rashire, demanding payment to themselves and not to the Governor under penalty of reprisals if they failed to comply.   I submit that this is the limit.&quot; Will it not be possible to let Darya Begi see what he can do ? He is confident that given support in material that he needs, he could dispose of the Khans. Even, as is possible, enemy were to retire to the hills and not await attack, Darya Begi would be able to demolish several of their habitations and shift Wassmuss. Any assertive action of this kind,that he took might be accepted as sufficient to save Darya Beg&apos;i&apos;s face and meet our requirements, and Farman Farina could then if still necessary be allowed to enter into relations with them.&quot; It would seem especially convenient to castigate these Khans, shift Wassmuss at this juncture as it would probably deter Niedermayer from joining forces with them shoidd he take southern route contemplated in Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 6th September. I trust situation will be reconsidered in the light of ,the above observations. Addressed to Foreign, Delhi, repeated to Bushire.&quot;Our views follow.4010.
