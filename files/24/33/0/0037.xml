From Sir P. Cox, 2)st November 1917. (Repeated to Foreign, Delhi, and Minister at Tehran.) (Received 22nd November, 11.30 a.m.)5200. My immediately preceding telegram. My reasons for not quoting remaining paragraphs of reply were, briefly, because 1 did not think they were of lively pertinence, and, secondly, because 1 could not quote them without making obstructive; criticism which, under the circumstances, 1 was anxious to avoid. Attitude of late Army Commander presented itself to me as follows : Mainly for the sake of adherence to academic principles, to which frequent exceptions have had to be (and will probably continue to have to be) made during this war, he considered it necessary to refuse ;i pressing request from responsible Government officials affecting immediate situation in Bakhtiari country in sphere of iiis Majesly&apos;s Minister, as well as in his own. It was for tin; latter reason that I felt bound to ask for orders of Government.Even if it were to become expedient on other grounds for tlx; despatch of troops to the heart of the Bakhtiari country in conceivable&apos; circuin-stauces, hardly seemed a practicable alternative course to tire presentation of 300 rifles to 111 khan i now. Moreover, the undertaking that troops would be despatched if necessary was [ ? ] dependent on the incidence of certain vague conditions, and the reference to a recent cast; gave me reason to think that it had, perhaps, been made without full consideration of what it. involved. Thus the instance to which allusion was made is the recent, visit of a small detachment of troops from Shush to quell a disturbance in the town of Shusliter, which is a town in theplains within the sphere of oil lields and within the range of our normal responsibilities during war. This simple measure is clearly no parallel to the despatch of troops for main-tenaiice of-vorder on A hwaz-Ispahan road, or for putting up opposition to pro-German elements in Bakhtiari country.Added to that the late Army Commander assured me in another connection, both before and after he recorded above1 undertaking, that he could not, at present spare a man for any side-shows.The view expressed by General Officer Commanding, Kafun Front, was that &quot;as happened last spring, the Hlkhani we support to-day may he in opposition to-morrow, and this is the drawback to distributing rifles in this manner.&quot;Zugmayer&apos;s diaries having proved Sardar Zaffar&apos;s friendliness to us, and it being the expressed opinion of the officials in best position to judge; (hat he is quite strong enough to prevent rifles falling into undesirable hands, it did not appear that General Officer Commanding Karun&apos;s remarks would carry -weight with higher authority, especially as they are inaccurate, for late lllkhani has never been actively hostile.
