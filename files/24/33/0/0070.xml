Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information. 5M/002Weekly Renprt on Denmark, II.(Nov.  23rd,  1917)Visit cf the King ef Sweden to Cocenhagen.His Majesty has been at the Danish capital accompanied by the Prime Minister and nroceeds at the end of November tf Christiania to attend a meeting of the Kings of the Scandinavian Countries and their Prime Ministers.     The fact that King Gustaf will visit the Norwegian capital is significant as this will be the first occasion since the separation of Norway and Sweden (1905) that the Swedish monarch has visited his former dominions.     In view tf the intense ill-feeling so long sxistihg between the two countries the visit is accaaimed by enthusiastic persons as a sign that the hatchet is buried.The exact object of the King Of SwedenTs visits is not clear. Recent events in Russia, the alarming progress of Germany in the Baltic, anarchy in Finland and, most important of all, the very serious food problem may well explain the desire of the Scandinavian Kings to discuss the situation.It is notorious that the Swedish const and a s40tion ef the1 of the upper class in th&amp;t country are strongly pro-German&apos;.     It is not impossible that the King of Denmark may be visiting Christiania to support his brother in oase of anything dangerous being proposed by King Oustaf for com&amp;on action by the Scandinavian Powers.     H.M.Minister at Christiania has warned the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs to keep clear of either a proposal for mediation between the belligerents or for Scandinavian resis-tance to the Entente.     The time chosen for the meeting certainly
ail)makes it appear as if the Swedish Government were afraid that Norway, by making a separate arrangement with the Allies might thus gain some advantage over her neighbours.Information from a reliable source in Denmark seems to ooint to King Gustaf being less favourably inclined to Germany than has hitherto been the case.     His Majesty however thinks that the probability of nussia making a separate peace increases the chances of Germany&apos;s ultimate success.     However this may be there is no doubt that the successes of Germany in the Baltic have considerably alarmed those persons in Sweden who are not fanatical partisans of the Central Powers.     At the same time the present Liberal-Socialist Coalition Ministry in Sweden (\ffera a guarantee against any pro-German schemes on the part of King Gustaf and the Activists meeting with public approval in his own country.Sir. R. Paget reports that in the opinion of the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs King Gustaf&apos;s visit has no speical object but is due to His Majestyfs desire to mark the solidarity of Scandinavian countries.The Icelandic fflag Question.This Controversy viz. Iceland&apos;s right or otherwise tr display a separate flag is now on the point of reaching its climax.Iceland which is already in possession if a separate legislature really aims at complete separation from Denmark, retaining only a common Monarch.     This aspiration has been growing for many years and has probably come to a head at the present moment from a desire not to be drawn into the war should Denmark be compelled to abandon her neutrality.     Dr. Knud Berlin, Professor of Law at the University of Copenhagen, in an article in the &quot;Kjobenha^n&quot; on Oct. 24. warns his countrymen that if Iceland carries the point
about the mercantile flag she will certainly obtain complete constitutional separation.     The fact that the King of Iceland happens alsovto be King of Denmark would be no guarantee against this eventuality.     He considers that the flag question shiuld be postponed until,by negotiations, the future relations of the two countries can be definitely adjusted.     Meanwhile, with coal at  14 a ton and an unlucky fishing season, Iceland is not happy.Food Problem, in Denmark.As in other neutral countries the question of the food supply is rapidly becoming of paramount imoortance.     On Nov. 15 the Minister of the Interior informed the Rigsdag of a series of im-portant Bills designed to meet the food shortage and the consequent dearness of living.     A maximum price for butter was foreshadowed, As this price was considerably below the current market price the State would pay the difference.     This would involve the State expenditure during the period Dec. 1. 17 to Ocr.31. 18 of nearly 33 million kronov ( 1.800.0001 Bacon, milk and c^eam would also be rationed.     A Bill was also presented for the payment by the State of subsidies to the communes to cover the heavy indemnities f*r the dearness of living which the communes have had to grant for fuel, public kitchens, the feeding of children etc     The State would pay back common Expenditure to the amount of 9 kronov (10/-)per head of the population.The shortage of horse fodder is causing great trouble, especially in the larger towns.     Prices have resen enormously, and to keep a horse costs about IE/- a day.     The reason appears to be that hay, straw, peas etc., have teen brought up in large quantities. Formerly fsrmers brought such produce to market, where the horses keepers purchased it as required.     Now the wholesale bujrers offer
it in train loads air huge prices.     few persons can afford to buy a whole load apart from the question of storage.     The Chairman of the carrier&apos;s Union had publicly stated that many horses are actually starving and therefore unable to do their usual work.A certain alleviation of the shortage tff food has taken place bytthe arrival o  enormous shoals of herrings in the Sound.     The daily catah has been about 35 tonsLighting Difficulties.The Paraffin Commission announced on Nov. 19 that in December and January next      pints of paraffin per month would be allowed to every homo in which there was no electric light.    In February the allowance would only be one pint and three quarters.     After that the the stock of paraffin will be exhausted and after Dec. 1 tradesmen and manufacturers will be unable to obtain paraffin for lighting shops etc.This shortage of oil will also affect a nember of Danish Light-houses and this will of course affect Navigation.Since Oct. 12 there has been early closing for places of public entertainment.An order prohibiting the export ef agricultural products, in-cluding pork, butter, eggs etc., was issued on Nov. 19.     The export -411, however, not be stopped, the Government simply desir-ing to control the exoort of provisions so as to obtain, by way at compensation the most needed commodities.     Export licensee will be granted on the recommendation of the Export Commission.Owing to the coal shortage several factories have clrsed down and the Germans are tempting trained Danish workmen, who are out of employment, tcaccept high wages in Germany.
- 5 *Correspondence between Lord. Robert Cecil and Professor Birk regarding Great Britain&apos;s volley tpward3 Denmark.TCommenting on this the &quot;National Ti&amp;ende&quot; says that Lord. R. Cecil&apos;8 letter strengthens the impression in Denmark that he has s^ympathy with small nations suffering from the war and would, when possible alleviate the conditionapf such countries.     Since his accession to office he has been much criticised by certain sections of the British press for too   much liberality in the BiockaSe policy towards foreign nations thereby prolonging the war. But he has constantly defended hie ptiicy in Parliament and tpenly asserted Denmark&apos;s loyalty to great Britain.     His letter was therefore received in Denmark with attention and good will.26. 11. 17.
