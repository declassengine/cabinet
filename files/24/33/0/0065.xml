MILITARY TRANSPORT  AMTRICAN LOOPING. .Discussions are proceeding with the American representatives as to the conveyance of American troops to France, and additional information is now available on which it is hoped to base more reliable estimates of the numbers that can be conveyed and the amount of tonnage which can be used for the purpose.5. RECRUITING..OF PQLTS IN U.S.A.AMD SHIPIOIT TO FRANCY&apos;This Department has been unable to- agree to the arrangements made without   the concurrence of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Shipping, for the conveyance of Poles from North America to France in Inglish Liners. The Foreign Office has been informed accordingly and counter-proposals have been made for the use of certain Russian tonnage to carry Poles, American troops and equipment etc., direct from the United States to France.6   CROSS CHANNEL LEAVE SERVICE.      Demands are being made to increase   the Cross-Channel leave service, and certain proposals hrve been &quot;agreed upon between the Ministry of Shipping and the War Office, but the question of escprt is still under consideration as the existing escort   is      ist
barely sufficient for the work at present carried on.7. ^PITnffiANI-AN im Off QCMTOQATtCftLThe Tarante route still remains closed, and shipment of troops to I gypt from Marseilles is proceeding.8  STTFFLF.S FOR BRITISH ARMY II I TALI.,,Arrangements for the supply as far as possible from France,.of the Fnglish Divisions in Italy are being made but certain direct shipments to Genoa have feeen provided at the request of the War Office^1 in view of the inability of the railways in France and Italy to carry everything necessary. 9 imm BEQUIPITIQiA decision, given in the Courts on the 15th instant, in the case of the China Mutual Steamship Company versus Maclay to the effect that the requisition of vessels under the terms of the Liner Requisition Scheme was invalid on the grounds that the letter.of requisition, in addition to requisitioning the vessel itself, purported to requisition the organisation of the Company for the purpose of managing the vessel, rendered it necessary for the Department to requisition in formal terms all the vessels engaged in Liner Service which are now being operated under the ;,iner Scheme.   This requisition was made on the 17th instant, the Liner Companies being kt the same time requested to inform the Shipping Controller y/hether they were prepared to give an assurance that thefwould co-operate in the management of the vessels in question.   &quot;Replies have already been received
in a large number of cases giving the assurance asked for, subject, however, in some instances to the reservation that in respect of the period covered by the original requisition all Owners are to be placed in the same position and that they will not be prejudiced in any way in relation to tiiose Companies which have not so far agreed to the arrangements which have been the subject of negotiations withthe Liner Companies.With regard to the legal decision that the original requisition was vitiated by the Mandatory form in which reference to the services to be rendered by the Liner Companies was made, it must be pointed out that it fed never been claimed, as supposed, by the Department,that the Shipping Controller had the power to requisition the services of the shipowners, and it is unfortunate that upon technical grounds the intention of the Department was defeated, because there was never any thought or desire on their part to assume powers which they knew they did not possess.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant.,(Signed) John Anderson.
