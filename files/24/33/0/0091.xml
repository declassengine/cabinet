(Memorandian by the Chancellor of the Exchequer)(l)      The first consideration is that these men are, ex hypotheai not regarded, as indispensable to the work of their Sopartraent The Post Office was prepared to let then go, and to fill their places, if at all, by temporary substitutes. (2)       They are only a small fraction of the conscientious objectors in the civil service who have been granted exemption subject to the condition that they undertake work of national importance.   The majority of such conscientious objeotorB find wtirk on the land, in factories, etc.   The Treasury ruling -the only possible one for administrative..reasons, apart from questions of equity - is that such men shall- be regarded as on special leave of absence without pay, the period counting neither for pension nor increment, and shall be left to earn the best rate of wages they can get for their services from their temporary employers.   The Treasury view has been that the man who happens - owing -to the decision of an individual Tribunal - to be allowed to remain in his old Department, where he is probably much more comfortable than his colleague who is sent to work on the land, should be given, as far  as possible the same terms, i,e. forego his substantive.pay and his pension rights, and receive instead the same rate of wages as would be paid to a temporary employee engaged from outside.It is submitted that it would be altogether unfair to to give the one CO. better terms than the other.Moreover, the Post Office proposal proposes to give their Conscientious Objectors better terms than the man who joins a Friends&apos; Ambulance Unit, or is serving with the Red Cross Society or St. Johnfs Ambulance Corps.
(3)    There is no compulkioiuabout the jjjoeittkii of these Conscientious. Objectors . * It was open to them to obtain the full benefit of &quot;Circular Terms&quot; by joining the Non-Combatant Corps, the members of which are treated, for purposes of civil salary, pension, etc., like members of the combatant forces, (4)    There is clearly no comparison between these men and those who are relieved from military service on grounds of domestic hardship, any more than with the men who are physically unfit for active service.   In both theea -wases the ground of relief is a circumstance over which - unlike his conscience -the man himself has no control.(5)     It is suggested that much of the Post Office difficulty is due to the fact that, when this question first arose inAugust 1916, they did not consult the Treasury as other Departments did.    The matter is one which clearly concerns the whole public service.In February 1917, the Treasury, having had their attention drawn to the matter by one or two other Departmsnts issued a general instruction on the subject.   The Post Office delayed raising objection until June 1917-(6)      No other public Department has raised any objection to the Treasury decision,, although the numbers affected outside the Post Office are probably small.Attention should be drawn to the filing expressed in the House of Commons in November 1916 on the case of Mr, Dickes, a Conscientious Objector who was allowed to return to duty,at the Admiralty as being work of national importance.   In deference to these expressions of public feeling, the Admiralty deemed it right to release him a /
second time for military service,   lickes was paia at that- time as a temporary employee in accordance with&apos;.a: Treasury decision.IThat will be the political effect when it becomes fcnown that Conscientious Objectors are not only being largely retained in the Public Service, but are being given specially generous terms of payr. etc.?In conclusion the Treasury hold strongly that there is no ground either of equity or expediency for giving these men,., rho though not regarded as iudisrens able to the Public Service, have been retained by accident in their Departments,. more favourable terms Jhan other Conscientious Objectors,. and submit that the decision given In the Treasury Circular is in accordance with public opinion generally throughout the country.,(Signed)     A.B0NAR LAW.Treasury Chambers,.
