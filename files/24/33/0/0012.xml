Unfortunately, the realisation of the earlier part of this scheme of new construction has been made impossible by the fact that steel to the required amount has not been available.Both the Controllers Report of the 6th July and the D.C.A.S. Memorandum which accompanied it made this essential point clear that the whole programme was conditional on a full aupply of steel and labour.Cent roller1s Report gara; 5a :     &quot;Steel is the principal Katerial which will cause difficulty.    Labour is the other difficulty, and the solution of both of these is essential if we are seriously to attempt to maintain a mercantile fleet&quot;.The same point that the whole programme was conditional and not absolute was made clear by the Controller at the War Cabinet Mo.180 on 10th July:-&quot;The Admiralty Controller pointed out that his programme depended upon steel and men being provided without delay, and that the fine weather was all-important in developing new works, etc. May in dealing with the matter would naturally materially affect forecast of output&quot;.As is evident from the above extracts, the possibilities of steel and labour had not at that time been ascertained.   This fact was recognised by the War Cabinet who appointed a Committee under Lord Curzon (War Cabinet No. 130 - 19b)    &quot;To examine the steel and labour situation having regard to the imperative requirements
of the Controller as set out in the report .......*&quot;&quot; V-     : - -Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee examined the supply of steel as existing at that date and the possible extensions.   The fact that during the summer months supplies were not forthcoming in accordance with the anticipations then held has definitely post-poned for a time the acceleration of shipbuilding.The Steel Production Department of the Ministry of 2&amp;mitions have now in part at least overcome their difficulties.   Output of steel, however, was very adversely affected in the latter part of?June and in July and August by strikes, holidays and by a lack of ore, and fell far below the quantity expected, and on which the estimates were based.The following table shews the Shipbuilding Programme as set out in June last with the steel said to be necessary for the realisa-tion of that programme.   The table also shews the actual output of tonnage to the end of October and the actual deliveries of steel.    For subsequent periods the anticipated supply of steel for building, fitting and repair of ships, which the Steel Production Department of the kinistry of jyfunitions agrees can be reasonably expected, is shevou    This depends, however, upon the shipments of ore from Spain and the Mediterranean being maintained to the amount of 550,000 - tons per month.    If the steel is forthcoming $he output of merchant tonnage shewn in the last column will be possible, provided also the labour dealt with hereafter is supplied, and a sufficient surplus of material will remain for warship production, Dockyard construction and other purposes (8,000-tons per week), and for merchant repairs and construction of auxiliary craft (6,000 tons per week.)

In view of the fact that the capacity of this country to produce steel will be strained to the utmost to meet the re-quirements as shewn in the table, and is even then insufficient for the required programme, it is urged that financial authority and diplomatic support should be given to the import of steel from U.S..A.It is probable that the U.S. will be better able to supply us with steel plates in the immediate future than in later months when her shipyards have been constructed and require plates for . shipbuilding.    It is proposed, therefore, to suggest to the U.S. that 20,000-tons of steel plates per month should be allocated for shipbuilding in the United Kingdom during the next six months. In support of this request and to assure her that the need of merchant ships is regarded as of absolutely first importance, it might be desirable to inform the U.S. Government that the War Cabinet at their meeting on Wednesday , 14th November, approved the recommendation of the War Priorities Committee in which the programme for shipbuilding had priority over the programmes for aeroplanes and airships, while the two aircraft programmes in their turn were so important as to justify a reduction in the output of other munitions, e.g., shell and rails.  The prime importance Of the shipbuilding programme was, therefore, clearly affirmed by the Cabinet.HE.The steel difficulties are being in part overcome, but with the more abundant supply of raw material the second necessary foundation for the shipbuilding programme - namely labour - must be provided at once if further postponement is to be avoided, and the more success that is achieved by the Steel Production Department the more labour will be needed for shipbuilding.   In the best year
on record - 1913 - the total production of shipping, bringing warships to a common denominator with merchant ships, was equiva-lent to 2,281,873-gross tons, while our programme requires an effort equal to the output of 4,500,OOO-gross tons.   It is evident that even when we hate expanded our steel, our machines, and our shipyards, and have simplified our type of ship, this increase of 97 per cent, above the peak of production reached by an efficient and fully developed industry, would strain the labour market even at a normal time.The merchant shipyards to-day are at least 20,000 men short of their normal complement.   They are burdened, in addition to the vast programme indicated above, by repairs on an unprecedented scale.  They are hampered by the fact that the men they have lost are in many cases their best.It is evident that however much the design of ships is simplified there are not in existence enough rivetters and iron-workers already trained to put together this great tonnage of ships1 plates -training, upgrading, dilution and piece-work are all necessary.Under all these circumstances, the only true statement of the position is that the yards from which this immense activity is required cannot be &quot;rationed&quot; - they must be fed to the full not only with material but with labour, and if any delay occurs in meeting this need the consequences will be disastrous.Until steel was forthcoming it was impossible to press upon the yards any scheme of labour saving.    A different situation supervenes when builders and their men realise that the pledge given by the Prime Minister to the shipbuilders and by the First Lord in Parliament is already in full operation, and that the capacity of the private yards must and will be used to the full if
we are to build enough ships.The shipbuilders already realise this fact.   They have had several interviews with the Minister of National Service, and have laid before him their present requirements so for as can be ascertained.   They have opened negotiations with the leaders of the Shipbuilding Unions to remove the prejudice existing against the use of labour saving appliances and against the greatest labour-saving appliance of all - namely payment by real Its.These negotiations promise success in the introduction of pneumatic rivetting on an extended scale, but on the subject of dilution the Shipyard Trade Unions laid stress on the necessity of the return to their homes and normal work of all their members at present serving in Home Forces, or invalided, or overseas if not y/orking at their trade.   Their Unions put this release as a condition precedent to further dilution.The shipbuilders consider, and in this thoy have the support of the Admiralty, that if by direct negotiation with their men they can achieve union in a policy to save labour and increase production, they will have taken an important step towards a full output of ships and a good understanding through the whole business of reconstruction;The complete demand for labour cannot for the moment be stated but with the improved supply of raw material 20,000 additional men are urgently required and the Admiralty press that this requirement and future requirements which will arise as steel increases, should have absolute priority above all other forms of recruiting.   If shipbuilding is considered vital to our continuance in the war, as is believed, then these men must come to the shipyards in advance of other services, and the Admiralty ask that orders be issued that
-men to the aggregate number of 20,000 of the respective classes .set out in the schedule hereto should be obtained at once as a first instalment of the requirements in the shipbuilding and marine engineering industries, and that the following resolutions should be approved :-(a) All men in the home or overseas armies who have been skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled workers in ship-building, shiprepairing and marine engineering indus*-tries and are not working at their respective trades in the Army to be transferred to the Army Reserve and sent back to the Employer in whose service they were before enlistment or recruitment.(b) Wounded and invalided soldiers and sailors with shipbuilding, shiprepairing and marine engineering experience to be similarly transferred.v(c) If sufficient men are not immediately forthcoming from sources (a) and (b), above, men suitable for work in shipbuilding and marine engineering to be withdrawn from Munitions work and any other available industries, such as tramways, railways, motor garages, etc.   In the first instance, it is suggested that 1,000 men should be drawn from these sources.It should be added that enquiries have been set on footboth with the R.N.V.R. and IUN.A.S. with the object of releasingworkers suitable for meeting the pressing urgency in theshipyards.(Signed)   A.
