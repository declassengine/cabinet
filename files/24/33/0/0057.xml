Neurasthenia and Shellshock.   A deputation of neurologists waited on the Minister on the 21st instant to lay before him some suggestions as to the treatment of neurasthenia.     The v.Tar Office have been considering the matter and had appointed a Committee composed of the members of the deputation to dray? up a report as to the adequacy of existing arrangements for dealing with cases of neurasthenia among serving soldiers prior to discharge and the Committee suggested to the Minister the importance of considering the treatment of neurasthenia- J 1both before and after discharge as a single matter.

The Minister received arepresentative gathering of makers of artificial limbs atthe Ministry on the 22nd instant, vho met at his request toconsider certain aspects of the questi on of the manufactureand supply of limbs.    The Minister explained some of thedifficulties which he considered required to be dealt with.He pointed to the diversity of the types of limb manufacturedand the absence at present of any standardisation, andannounced his intention ofinstituting an experimentallabor at tiry for the study of the best type of limb requiredwithfact that some of the additional accommodation provided has within the past three weeks been completed and become available for use., it may be convenient to summarise the position in regard to treatment of this disease *    The available accommodation prior to the institution of the Ministry for these cases amounted to about 300 beds in England and Wales. The following is the additional accommodation undertaken to be provided by the Ministry and the number of beds open up*to date:-Chalfont Cofcony, 3 Cottage Homes.

with the ultimate object of arriving at a standard limb which Me would then invite limb-makers to manufacture *     He proposed that the limb-makers should make use of this laboratory for the purpose of experimenting and testing new appliances which they thought promising and suggested that    representatives of the trade might be nominated to the Committee Of Management * The laboratory would also serve the purpose of a training school for disabled men in 1imb-makingi     The Minister finally invited the members of the Conference to elect a Committee to assist him in working out the proposal and this they agreed to do*    At a subsequent conference of the limb manufacturers a resolution was carried agreeing to produce the standard limb required by the Ministry. 15cG-eneral Schemes of treatment submitted etc.   Appendix IXcontains a report of the general schemes of treatment submitted by Local Committees or sanctioned during the week ended 21st instantc.    It will be seen from the report that during the week substantial additions have been made to the hospitals of which the use has been sanctioned to Local Committees at the rates allowed by the Instructions issued by the Ministry.16-* Individual Cases of Treatment *   The great bulk of cases oftreatment are under general schemes which have received approval, but a small number of cases requiring special treatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has not previously been given are submitted each week,     Buring the week ended (he 21st November 64 such cases were so sanctioned.17o Numbers under treatment;.   Appendix X shows the number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal TJarrant are payable.   It will be seen that 395 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended the 21st November and that 3178 men were under treatment on that date, as compared with 2881 men at the end of the previous weev- The
Tho Table shows also the nature of the disablements for ^hioh treatment was required, and it rill be seen that more than two-fifths of the cases have been of wounds or injuries &apos;2 per cent having been cases of paraplegia.     95 cases of neurasthenia arc under treatment at Golders Green and 33 of advances tuberculosis in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Boa-..r,ih London.

At the last meeting of their Committee it &apos;ad been decided, at the instance of the trade-unionists, that the. Instructor should receive from any employer for training disabled men, 15/- a. week in addition to a guaranteed weekly wage.      As these terms were very much more favourable, to tho Instructor than.those granted in other traces the Committee were asked to reconsider their decision and or the result revised terms, more in line with other tracer, were recommended.     Their recommendations will require the approval of the Executive Committee of the National Federation of Societies of the.Brushmaking Trade, (Appendix XI) / IS. Training under the Board of.Agriculture.(1) Scotland.:. As a result of an. interview with Sir Robert Wright:of the.Board of Agriculture, for Scotland, arrangements: have, now been concluded, whereby that Board have undertaken to arrange -for the training and employment of : disabled men in Forestry.   .&apos;. The work will in many cases be suitable for men in the first stage of tuberculosis, or men suffering from the effects of shell.shock and other forms of functional nerve disease.     A circular, is being issued toLocal
Local Committees drawing attention to the tanilities q^ferod^iAlready several large landowners have agreed to engage a number of the meru (2) England?The Board o  Agriculture (England) have been approached with a view to their adopting similar measures for England and It is hoped that such provision will be made at en early date. 20*   General Schemes of Training. Appendix XII*       Appendix XIIcontains particulars of Schemes submitted during the week from the Brighton, Bristol, Birminghari, Essex, Kesteven, Kenty Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle on Tyne, Oaford, Smethwiclc, Wimbledon, and WIgan Local Committees, and from the Mid. Ireland and South West Scotland Joint Committees.    In some cases further consideration it necessary, in others Committees were asked to supply further details, while courses In 31 subjects are sanctioned. 21* Individual Cages of Training.    During the week 94 cases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned, compared with 67 cases during the previous weeko      In 190 cases further information was asked for or modifications of the original proposals suggested. 221 Number of Hen under Training.    Appendix XIII shows that 65 men were admitted to and 10 discharged from training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported- as under training at the end of the week was 782.. 23* Trairtto; for Widows.   Messrs. Bourne c: Hollingsworth haveagreed to take a large, number of widows into their Establishment on the same terms as those recently offered by Messrs Debenham and Freebody, and referred to in paragraph   23 of last week!s report.A circular letter sent to the Local Committees asking them to state what in their opinion is the approximate number ofwidow^
widows who would seek trainining in their respective areas has been answered by 94 Committees.    A large number of the Committees have not found it possible to give any estimate but the general concensus of opinion would sppsar to be that owing to the great demand at present for women&apos;s labour, and; the consequent ease with which even untrained persons can obtain employment, there is no prospect of any large number of candidates for training coming forward in the immediate future * ^irminghcm  Birkenhead, and Waterloo - with-Seaf orth are the only Local Commit  ys who anticipate as many as 50 applications.     Pull provision is being made to meet the demand likely to arise when war work ceases. 24. Illustrated Lecture on Trainings- A lecture illustrated by lantern slides and cinematograph films has been prepared to show the work going on in the -various Training Centres, for the after-care of the disabled sailor and soldier.     Particulars are given in Circular No. 36 (Appendix XIV).     It is intended that this Lecture shall be delivered   by the Chairman or some official of the War Pensions Committee in each town, where these gommittees have been set up.    Where it is found desirable one of the members of the staff of the Training Department can deliver the Lecture.     Although the Circular has only just been issued, Lectures have already been arranged at Edmonton, Woodgreen, Brighton,,Newcastle on Tyne and Kingston on Thames, Dumfries, Cheltenham etc. 25. Popular Pamphlet on Treatment and Training.     An interesting little book telling hew soldiers and sailors disabled in the war are being restored at the national, expense is attached as Appendix XV.   The book gives a clear and simple account of the system whereby every effort is being made to restore men to health and of the generous allowances granted to the man and his dependants whilst he is undergoing treatment,but,
but its main object is to induce men to be trained. Undoubtedly many men are able to return to their former work and, at present, to hold their own, but there is a large number who, not being able to go back to their old work have entered upon jobs   which will come to an end with the war.    As soon as the able-bodied men return they will take the place of these disabled men, who will then in iarge numbers c^me upon this Department for training.     To avoid, as far as possible, the inevitable rush for training at the nnd of the war with the attendant delays and waiting lists, and   sole dopondoncG on a pension insufficient for full needs, and to help injured men to get into permanent work , te fore the great influx of the able-bodied, the book., strongly urges disabled men.to seize the present opportunity and apply to be trained by the Ministry.ORGANIZATION.26. Reports of Inspectorsc   Extracts from reports of Inspectors &amp;f Accounts for the week ended 21st November are contained in Appendix XVI,In the   North Y/est Area the Farnworth Local Committee has improved.    Dudley in the West Midlands, which has hitherto been well reported on seems weak in hemevisiting.In North Wales the organization and administration of the Carnarvon Local Committee needs bringing up-to-*datej Merioneth has been &quot;rescued&quot; from a &quot;terrible muddle&quot;, 7/hilst the Flintshire Local Committee is to be thoroughly overhauled in the near future.From Fifeshire comes a complaint that delay In approving training schemes puts men off, training; Ivirkcaldy is well reported onj Dumbarton local Committee seems well organised.    The estimates of the administrative expenses of the County Car low Local Committee are approved at what seems a conservative figure?
i  .        2482l4 Naval and Military War, Pensions etOo (local Committees) Bill.The scope of this Bill, which was last referred to in paragraph 35 of report XLXE,   has been enlarged along the lines discussed in the second reading Debate.    A copy of the Bill   as read a third time in the House of Commons and passed is attached as Appendix XVII.     The Bill as amended provides definitely for the inclusion in Local and District Committees of at least two disabled discharged men and also of a pensioned widow or dependant of a man who has died from causes arising out of war service..     Provision is also made for the inclusion of at least two disabled discharged men i&amp;  all sub-committees, appointed for any pan, of the area of a local committee and in all joint : committees.28. &quot;A good Press&quot; *     An Art icle w ritten primarily for the War Pensions Gazette but which might with advantage have a far more extended circulation, is-attached as Appendix XVIII. The purpose of the Article is to explain to War Pension Committees how to secure a good press and the essence of the advice is that these Committees should take the Press completely into their confidence.     Another point strongly urged is that whenever cases of grievance are alleged they should instantly be followed up and investigated,, and that the Ministry should frankly admit   mistakes when it has made them.     But the Article speaks for itself............. Staff etc  .29.   Appendix XIX shows an addition of 56 to the. staff.of the Ministry during the week, the chief increases being 31 to the tensions Issue Office and 17 to the Administration.   The . ... staff on the books of the Ministry now. comprises 293 ra3n.and 4,643. women, or 49.3.6 In all.The dan.ly percentage of absences during the week . was 23j, among the male and 43 among the female staff.
/Soldiers Award Brancho Reorganization.       The re*-organization of the work of the Soldiers Award   Branch, located at Chelsea which has been referred to in recent reports, is now being undertaken by Sir Woodburn Kirby, who nas most kindly placed his services at the disposal of the Minister.    Sir Woodburn Kirby, will be remembered, has already reorganized the Issue Office at Baker Street, and the improvements which he introduced there have led to greatly increased efficiency and acceleration of the work.Sir Woodburn took up duty at Chelsea on the 19thinstant.November 24th 1917.(Sd.)

The draft circular as amended was approved and it was decided to refer the same to the War Office for approval previous to its distribution to Local Committees *In connection with the matter referred by the Ministry to theSpecial Grants Committee as to whether discharged disabled soldiers shculd carry with them a record of the assistance granted them by Local Committees and some means of identifica-tion, which had been left over for further consideration from last meeting, it was decided that no cards should be compulsor and that there were objections to the suggestion which it was/SPECIAL GRANTS COMMITT&amp;EMinutes of Meeting held at 22, Abingdon Street, S.W. on Tuesday, 6th November, 1917.
felt would be distasteful to the great majority of discharged disabled soldiersa   It was, however, pointed out that Local Committees should recommend to men in their areas who were likely to leave the same for employment elsewhere to obtain a letter from their Local Committee to the Local Committee of the area to which they intend to proceed.Circular 20 from the Ministry regarding the establishment of ths Willis James Bequest Fund was duly noted, and it was decided that the signature of any two members should be sufficient on the Warrant for payment against this Fund, which will be administered by a section consisting of any two members of the Committee.A letter from the Secretary of the Pensions Ministry in reply to the representations of the Special Grants Committee regarding delays was read and duly noted.A question which had been referred to the full Committee by the Forfeiture Section regarding the forfeiture of Separation Allowance of Mrs3 Wootton, Case No*- 661, was duly considered and the Section!s decision in the matter approved.

APPEND.il     TT-y .INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATMENT AND ThAININGT.Payment of Pension on termination of Treatment or Training.page 14, Instruction 3b, Add the following proviso:-&quot;Provided that, if in any cases the Local Committeeare not informed before any period of treatment or trainingterminates, the Committee shall, as soon as they are so informed,cease payment of all allowances to the man and to his family and inklieu thereof shall pay to tho man each week the amount of thepension and children&apos;s allowances to which he is entitled untilthey receive, the ring-paper from the Pension Issue Office&quot;Note.   The foregoing modification of the Instructions is intendedto meet the difficulty whioh has been caused by delay in the returnof the ring-paper on the termination of treatment or training.   Thisdelay is mainly due to tho fact that the Local Committee cannot inmany cases be informed in advance of the date when treatment willterminate.   In any case, therefore where the Local Committ e areonly advised of the termination of treatment after such treatmenthas in fact ceased they should at once forward form T.R.2. to Pensionissue   ^Office, but they are empowered to pay each week to the manan amount equal to the pension to which he is entitled, instead ofthe allowance which he and his family   have been receiving duringtreatment or training, until they are f\ rnished by Pension IssueOffice with a further ring-paper for the man and a further book ofallowance forms has been sent to the Post Office.     The amount cfpension to which the man is entitled is notified to the Locala 58Committee in all cases on Form A ^The first payment by the Committee should be made on the first Wednesday aftor termination of the treatment or training.258
The Local Committee will note that the procedure -&quot;by-whioh the rangpaper is returned to the-Committee instead of to the man, as laid down in Instruction 36 is now restored, and the last paragraph of the Circular letter of the 29th -instant on this point is therefore cancelled.
TREATMENT AND TRAINING. OP DISABLED MEN.Orthopaedic Treatment.Modification of Instructions and Notes.Page 38 for the first paragraph the following should be substituted:-&quot;Treatment of discharged men in the-se hospitals Is for the most part out-patient treatment., -and where it. i-s so the man Bhould lie lodged in the neighbourhood of the hospital (see as to this, page 39).    In any case where special orthopaedic- treatment is required tho Local Committee should communicate with the officor in charge of the military ortiiopaedic hospital nearest the man!s homo and arrange for his treatment there, in accordance with paragraph 11 of tho Army&apos;Council Instruction 1531 of 1917, Where, howaver, special treatment at a military orthopaedic centro Is not necessary, the man should be sent to the nearest civil hospital which has the noceesary equipment.     The Local Ctmmittso will be responsible for all allowances to the man and his family and any necessary payments to tho institution&quot;. Page 49, paragraph (e) Delete this paragraph.Hot9. the foregoing emendments to the Instructions and Notes have been adopted in order to enable Local Committees to deal directly with orthopaedic cases without the intervention of the Ministry and to pay the allowances necessary in such cases.   The Ministry will not in future arrange for treatment or pay allowances in any case ef orthopaedic treatment.

Forty six were from the London area and twenty five from various Counties. Thirteen patients had been discharged at their own request and three had been sent to Down Sanatorium.   Ho had made arrangements foxtthe provision of 15 beds at tho Cottingham Sanatorium at Hull, (TajL.
(bl   Standard Pavilions:   Delay bad arisen with regard to the tenders for the standard Pavilions at Birmingham, St.  ; Helens and Bristol owing to an arrangement being oome to, that no tenders be made unless quantities were given.   This would ; now be done and the difficulty overcome.   A general discussion took place with regard to the Pavilions and their oost.   It was agreed to go into the natter fully when the tenders were in. The question of the method of payment by the Bed Cross Society for the first four pavilions was also discussed.   It was suggested that the Office of works might be asked to provide up to  8,000 and the Red Cross the extra (if any).   Sir Arthur Stanley said he thought this oould be done.Sir Arthur Bosoawen said he thought that the best course to adopt was to approach the Treasury direct for the cost of the Four Pavilions.   It was deoided to discuss the matter further at a subsequent meeting when the complete tenders were available,(c) Southampton:   a discussion took place with regard to the establishment of a Pavi&amp;ion at Southampton and iviajor Hartley was asked and agreed to confer with the Town Council of!-: Southampton and report to the Committee at a later meeting.(d) Exeter;   with regard to the provision of accommodation in Bxeter Dr. Chapman and Mr. Kitchen had visited two sites.He did not regard the Pinhoe Iao5a*ion Hospital site as being as suitable as Heavitree Isolation Hospital and recommended that a Pavilion should be erected at the latter place to provide the accommodation there.   The Committee agreed to the recommend-atlon and Major Hartley agreedto make the necessary preliminary arrangements and report to a subsequent meeting.(e) Manchester:   further provision was necessary for patients here and it was suggested that  4 beds should be provide^.   He had been in communication w$th the Hon. Bdwara Cozens Hardy who agreed that there was need for accommodation for advanced cases and thought that the Bolton Isolation Hospital at iiongworth was the most suitable site.   Major Hartley was asked and agreed to inspect the site and furnish a reportto the Committee.(t)   Papworth Hall:   Sir Geerge Bullock had been able to make arrangements that 50 German prisoners should be put to KOrk at this Institution and the necessary details were now being completed.(g) wales:   Major Hartley presented to the Committee a (report on his visit to the South &quot;w^les ^sanatorium and the Korth wales Sanatorium.   A copy of the report is hereunto annexed marked &quot;B&quot;.A general disoussion took place on the report and the quoeticn of workshops.   The Committee decided to adhere to their policy of training in connection with After care treatment and that it was preferable to have the Colony in South Wales where the majority of the men came from and would consequently be near their families and friends.   It was resolved that Major Hartley should arrange to meet Major Mitchell and Mr. D. w* Evans to disouss the matter and get out plans for workshops and report to a subsequent meeting of the Committee.(h) forestry:   The questions of providing i-orestry work for tuberculous patients and particularly at the forest of Deanwas

There were four pairs Qf cottages which oould be acquired for  260 per pair.   If the Ministry would provide the cost  1,040 the Authorities at the Colony would maintain and place them at the disposal of the Ministry so long as they were required.   Sir Harry; Haward pointed out that if the money was provided the Office of Works should lease the Cottages to the Colony authorities at a nominal rent on the understanding  &quot;thtt they were placed at the disposition of the Ministry.A general discussion took place on the Scheme and it was agreed that the treatment that could be offered in this way would be valuable.It was agreed to recommend to the Ministry that the Cottages be purchased through His Majesty1s Offioe of works and that a letter bo written to Mrs. Dimsdale informing her of the recommendation.(j)   Colchester Isolation Hospital, EssexChingforft Sanatorium, Easex,   A letter dated 20th November from the Chief Tuberculosis Officer Essex County Council was read relative to the desirability of establishing a Sanatorium in Essex and suggesting Chingford and Colchester as suitable sites.   It was resolved that as sufficient beds were at present provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board hospitals for advanced tuberculous cases in the Essex area there was no need at present to provide further accommodation and that a recommendation be made to the Ministry that the Tuberculosis Department Easex  County Council be so informed.4.   EPILEPSY:A letter datod 21st November from the Secretary of the   National Hospital, Queons Square, relative to providing accommodation for   Epileptic Paraplegic cases.

Horo when tho matter could be discussed fully and a report subsequently presented to the Committee.5.   LONDON JEWISH HOSPITaL:A letter dated 15th November from Mr. Edwin T.

. OitflCSRS BEOUPBBaTIVS HOSTEL;Sir George Bullock placed before the Committee an offer made through Mrs. Boys of a house near Hampstead &quot;to be used for Neurasthenic Officers.   It was resolved that as the demand for aooonuodation of this nature was being met at   westgate, Beokenham Junction which could accommodate 15 Officers there was no neooasity to establish another home until westgate was full.   Sir George Bullock agreed to communicate the decision to Mrs. Boys.
Deputation on the subject of the treatment of Neurasthenia.A deputation consisting Qf Doctors Head, 3uzzard, Maurice Craig and Professor Elliot Smith was seen by the Minister on the 21st instant.   Sir Matthew Nathan, Sir John Collie, Sir Alfred Pearce Gould and Mr, Hore were also present,Dr. Head explained the object pf the deputation. He stated that members of the deputation formed a Committee to whom the War Office had entrusted the task of examining the present methods of dealing with soldiers suffering from neurasthenia and the adequacy of the provision made for them.     The Committee had framed a report which has been submitted to the Director General and is now under his consideration.Dr,Head explained shortly the recommendations of the report.     The Committee had recommended that.in place of the present system under which soldiers suffering from neurasthenia qr shell-shock were retained some time in French hospitals and then relegated in many instances to Auxiliary hospitals in this Country for convalescent treatmentsuch men should be sent home as early as possible and placed In special hospitals devoted to the treatment of this class of case alonee    It was the view of the Committee that were these cases properly dealt with at the qutset a much larger number than at present might be cured within a considerably shorter time than that which no?/ elapses.With regard to the large number of men who have up to now been discharged on account of neurasthenia, Dr. Head suggested they were divisible into four classes, namely1.     The men who do not require further treatment, but who can take up work, though in most cases they can only d$ something less than a full days work,-    As regards these cases Dr. Head urged the Minister to impress on employers the duty of employing such men on half-time and said that at present it was next door to impossible to induce employers to take men on such terms,2.     The men who still require treatment either in or at an institution,3.     The men whose attitude Is directly antagonistic to treatment and recovery, the class which French medicine had recognised   under the title &quot;men of mauvaise volonte&quot;.4,     Men who after return to the ordinary conditions of civil life suffer relapse.The final point made by Dr. Head   was a strong criticism of the practice of giving monetary assistance to neurasthenic cases under the title of &quot;pension&quot;,     On behalf of the Committee he urged that the knowledge that a man had a pension induced him to believe that the attempt to cure him was directed tc reducing his pension and if he were cured and his pension reduced he regarded himself as wronged.The Minister in replying to the deputation intimated that his Department did attach the greatest Importance   to the, proper treatment of neurasthenia and he was now engaged in providing Institutions for the proper treatment :of these cases on the line which had been proved successful at the Golders Green Home Of Recovery. Any effort  in the direction of providing the serving soldier who is suffering from neurasthenia with appropriate treatment and at an earlier date than he received it at present would have his strongest support.     On two of the points made by the: Deputation, namely, as to the necessity for obtaining half-time work ror neurasthenics and forsubstituting
substituting the disablement allowances In place of pension, the Minister expressed his cordial sympathy, and as regards the former point he stated that he had already recognised the importance of not pressing a man In this condition to do more that he is able to do and so bringing about a relapse.      The Minister pointed out however, that much of the work of dealing with neurasthenics was of an experimental kind and that even if certain kinds of nervous complaints arising from Industrial stress or accident were common knowledge to neurologists before the War, the conditions created by the present War were new to the profession and their proper treatment must necessarily take time to elaborate.

Committees are now being held especially in connection with the Furniture Trade and Boot and Shoe Repairing,BbUSHMAKING.     November 15th, 1917,At the last meeting of this Committee the trade unionists put forward a scheme that the instructor not only should be guaranteed his weekly wage on the average of the last thirteen weeks but should in addition receive the sum of 15/- per week from the employer for training disabled men.   As these conditions were very much more favourable to the teacher than those in other trades the Committee was asked to re-consider their   decision and the following revised terms were suggested.Training in Brushmaking to be for a period of six months.1st to 3rd months no contribution from the employer.4th month employer to contribute 7/65th Month employer to contribute 10/-6th Month employer to contribute 12/6.As far as firms within the British Brush Manufacturers1 Association are concerned it was agreed that the teacher   should receive the whole output of the disabled man during the first three months and during the 4th, 5th and 6th months the whole output minus^ the sum of 7/6, 10/- and 12/6 respectively, per week.It is to be observed that these., recommendations havo not yet been approved by the Executive   Committee of the National Federation cf Societies of the Brushmaking Trade but they   are to be brought up at a meeting in the near future.

APPENDIX   XVI. ORGANIZATION BRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 21st November,1917,COUNTY OF CARNARVON LOCAL COMMITTEE.There are six Sub-Committees, each granted executive powers for dealing with Part II Regulations.,   No proper system appears to have been adopted with regard to Recoverable Advances.There are 820 discharged men on the Register, whioh is kept up to date.   Case-papers are only set up where a man applies for treatment or training, but a complete record is to be maintained of every discharged man in the County.Carnarvon Sub-Committee. *On visiting the local Post Office where the usual notice was displayed the official in reply was very emphatic in her statement that there was no Local Committee in Carnarvon.   There is -lack of co-ordination between the Local and District Committees,   it was arranged that the Inspector for North Wales should pay another visit at an early date.,MERIONETHSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Population 40,000.   Industries slate and agriculture. Seven Sub-Committees cover Petty Sessional areas.   Ir Recoverable Advances, the system Is-unsatisfactory.As regards Disablement, the Register is nok up to date and a case-paper has been prepared for every man in the County, numbering 330.*Great credit is due to the Secretary, Mr. Phillips, for the manner in which he has rescued this Committee from a terrible muddle.FLINTSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.,Population 95,000.   Industries steel, coal and agriculture. There are five District Committees with no power except that of making Emergency Grants.   The &amp;ecretary on being asked why these District Committeesr powers were limited stated, &quot;I am afraid to place the power in their hands, I know the weakness&quot;.With respect to discharged men, case papers are only maintained where an application is made by a man ffcr help, but this is going to be altered.   This Committee will be thoroughly overhauled at an early da e.KIRKSALPY LOCAL COMMITTEE.The work is well attended t)o and the accounts are well kept. There is nothing to call for special remark.
L i .0FIFESHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE. ........&quot; f.....&apos;     &apos;...... -......There Is nothing of special note to report except that men are sometimes sent for training in mechanical work at Cowdenbeath Technical School,   Frequently they leave for employ*-ment in munition works at very short notice, giving the Committee no time to advise the pensions Issue Office as to the re-issue of the Ring Paper;   so that there is a gap between the close of training and the recommencement of pension. The men complain about delay in getting approval to their training schemes with the result that they will not wait,and obtain employment, possibly of an unsuitable&apos;nature.DUMBARTON LOCAL COMMCTSB,In addition to the Local Committee there is a Sub-Committee of Finances and General Purposes.   This Sub-Committee deals with all applications requiring the sanction of the Local Committee and their decisions are submitted for approval at the Quarterly meeting of the Local Committee.   The County is divided according to parishes, nine in number, each parish has two District Committees, one for dealing with the care of wives and dependants, and the other for dealing with disabled officers and men.   Each Committee has a Secretary and Treasurer-   The Local Committee haa delegated to District Committees all powers and duties that can be delegated.   The accounts are well kept and are up to date.   There has been a gradual increase in the payments under 13(a),FARNWORTff LOCAL COMMITTEE.The irregular payments to which the Inspector drew attention at his last visit have now ceased, but there are still a few which will have to be reconsidered.The Inspector found that in many cases only 12/6 Is being paid where there are several dependants and a higher assessed dependence,   it does not appear to be generally known that Paymasters will pay more in these cases, thereby reducing the necessity for supplementary allowances, and he suggests that a reminder be sent to all Secretaries on the subject.Dudley local committee.The town is divided into two Wards with a Sub-Committee in each.   The work is uneven.   The weak point of this Local Committee lies in the home visiting, expecially of disabled men. The Regulations are observed and the accounts are well kept. Objection is taken to the dissection of accounts required by the Pensions Ministry Regulations and it is suggested that the dissection on Forms R.I., R,4,, and R,ll should be abolished.COUNTY CAR LOW LOCAL COMMITTEE.Administrative expenses amounting to  74 have been approved by the Local Government Board as expenses from 17th May 1917 to the 31st March 1918*   The expenditure for the Quarter ended 31st March last was  43, 15, 3&quot;, and  46, 1, 8, for the June Quarter.

Ministry of Pensions,Westminster House,Millbank, S.W. 1.November, 1917.[The, following article has been written for the War Pensions Gazette by Mr. Harcourt Kitchin, and has been printed in this form for the information and guidance of Local War Pensions Committees.]THE USES OF PUBLICITY.My purpose in writing this article is to explain to the Local War Pensions Committee how they may very materially assist the Ministry in securing what is known as a &quot; good Press.&quot; A good Press does not mean a Press which is merely complimentary and uncritical; that kind of Press is of no use to anyone and exaspe-rates those who conceive that they have grievances which need ventilation. A &quot; good Press &quot; is one which is sympathetic because well informed, which criticises freely when, with full understanding of the circumstances, criticism appears to be called for, but which does not indulge in carping or nagging. Newspapers have no wish to be unfair even to Government Departments notoriously uu-popular institutions and they can become quite friendly if satisfied of two things :-first, that a Department honestly is trying to carry out its duties in a humane spirit, and, secondly, that it puts forward no claim to infallibility. If the Pensions Ministry and its Local Committees will take the Press frankly into their confidence, let it know of their difficulties and of -what thev seek, however im-perfectly, to achieve for the benefit of discharged disabled men, for widows and for children and other dependants, and that they are(14201.)   Wt. 5883 Q 113.   30,000.   11/17.   d &amp; 8.   Q. 2.
2alert to examine into all grievances real&apos; or unreal-r^and to admit mistakes when they have been made ; then the Press will do its best to help them. I have been a newspaper editor and most other things connected with newspapers for nearly 25 years and I know my colleagues. Be frank with them and they will respond and be frank with you.My first suggestion to the Local Committees under which general title I include the large joint-area Committees for treat-ment and training, and the many Sub-Committees within county areas is that they should invite the representatives of the local newspapers to all their meetings. Large daily papers circulating in a district have not much space nowadays for reports of meetings of Local War Pensions Committees. Nevertheless, they should always be invited to send representatives. A skilfully condensed paragraph of a few lines is always worth having in a newspaper of wide circulation. The local evening newspapers should also be invited to send, and in my view, most important of all the weekly papers. The Local War Pensions Committees are doing work which is of wide public interest; their operations affect a great number of people who are the objects of public sympathy. If the general public are to be kept informed of their good work and how they are always trying to make that good work better, the Committees must sit with open doors and ask the representatives of newspapers to come in. They will get more space in weekly papers which specialise in local news than in big morning and evening newspapers which are compelled to take the whole world for their province. Therefore, while showing hospitality to the big papers, let the Committees never neglect the smaller weekly ones. I am aware that several Local Committees already do what I am asking all to do. Some neglect the opportunities for publicity which are at their doors. I would have them all realise that the public cannot be made to understand fully, and sympathise fully, except through the information supplied by the newspapers.When the representatives of the Press attend the meetings of Committees, let them be treated as members of a most responsible profession. Let them be handed all information which may be published, and informed of what should be regarded as confidential.
o not say toHhem : &quot;You must not report this or that; you ust.not be told this or that because it is confidential.&quot; Let them iow of everything -which is being done, indicating what it is not isired should be immediately made public. Trust the repre-ntatives of the Press and they will not let you down. Some of i newspaper men know more of what is being done at home and iroad than most of the members of the Government, but we do )t misuse our knowledge. The more we know - the better we can iderstand the reasons for secrecy, and the more certain we&apos; are to ;ep faith. Therefore I say, trust the Press, let its members know actly what you are doing and why you&apos;do it, treat them as orthy of confidence, and you will not be disappointed.Try always when giving information for publication to put it i a form which can be readily understood. Look out for the news &quot; value of information and supply it fresh and hot. &quot; News &quot; not like wine ; it does not improve by keeping.There is another most important means by which the Local ommittees may assist the Ministry to win the confidence of&apos; the rantry. From time to time letters or editorial notes will appear i newspapers dealing with the grievances of individuals dis-arged sailors or soldiers, widows or dependants against the ommittees or against the Ministry. It is almost inevitable that iere should now and then be cases of real hardship. The numbers E men, women and children with whom the Ministry seeks to deal e expanding by thousands weekly, and it is working with an ;temporised staff. Whenever cases of grievance are alleged they ill usually be anonymous they should be instantly followed up. lie editor should be written to at once by the Secretary of the jocal Committee in whose district the newspaper publishing an llegation of hardship circulates. He should be asked to put the -ocal Committees in touch with the writer of the letter, or the ispirer of the note, in order that full details for investigation may e obtained. No newspaper ever gives away the name of a mtributor or correspondent, but as a rule an editor will seek to ring a contributor or correspondent who states a case of hardship lto touch with the Secretary of the Local Committee who desires ) investigate it.   If those who allege grievances refuse to give
particulars then the editor should be informed at once. He wil not continue to give publicity to statements which are no supported by evidence. If particulars are given, then a fu] investigation should be made in the local records or in those o headquarters ; everything should be done which is necessary f0 complete elucidation.As soon as the Local Committee directly concerned has got tt the bottom of the alleged grievance or hardship, the result shout; be communicated at once to the editor of the newspaper in whicl the charge originally appeared. Whether the result is favourable or unfavourable to the Ministry of Pensions and its Committe should make no difference at all. The result should be com municated frankly and fully. If there has been a mistake mad: and a real grievance discovered then the immediate public assuranc of redress will inspire confidence. If the grievance is baseless, thei the public should be informed that its sympathies have bee played with. &quot;We cannot ask editors of newspapers to submi: allegations of grievance or hardship to the Local Committee before making them public though if we win their confidence w may in time arrive at this practical expression of it-but we cat show to the editors that we are eager to investigate any chargt against us and to plead guilty whenever the evidence points to oui guilt. The very worst thing which any officer of the Ministry oi of any Local Committee can do is to claim infallibility for himself, or for the Department.F. HARCOURT KITCHIN.
