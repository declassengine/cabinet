JT   ( &apos;A&amp;W/030DEPARTMENT Off INFORMATION INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.&apos;0WEEKLY    REPORT     ON     GERMANY 27 November, 1917.1,      The arrangements for the new German and Prussian Administrations have now been completed and, for the present, the prolonged orisis is over.     Count Eertling will meet the Reichstag and the Prussian Chambers during the next few days. It may, therefore, be convenient to givo a very brief summary of the position.If we look back at the whole course of evonts since the resignation of Bothmann Hollwag, it is impossible to doubt that thoy Imply very definite progress in Germany towards &quot;parliamentarism&quot;.    On the whole we must acknowledge that the crisis has for the moment been handled with more suocosa than was anticipated;   both the Government and the Parties seem to have shown unusual skill, and they have succeeded in bringing about an arrangement by which, if it is kept to, the Government may have the necessary support, not only of a good working majority in the Reichstag, but also In the ooun-try.    The points to keep in mind are first that the new Ohancellor, before acoeptlng office, coneultod the leaders of the Parties, and arranged with them an agreod programme, and secondly, that he hes boen allowed a free hand in selecting, his *two chief collaborators, both in tho Prussian Government and in the Imperial Departments of. State,    As a result, we find that, while the Gentro is represented in tho person of tho Chancellor himself, important posts have been found for leaders of the National-liberals and the Radicals.    As matters stand at the moment, the support of these parties,
therefore, has been secured;   the Socialists cf the Majority, unlike the Radicals, have declined to put forward a candidate for Government office, and content themselves with the Radical Vioe*OhanceJ.lor, Payer.They profess great hopes as to the result of all that has happened;   they take tbe view that a definite and irrevocable step has beon taken towards the parliamontarisation of the Government;   they reoord this achievement with great satisfaction, and at the same time, indulge in the hope that it will definitely turn to their advantage after the war. They expect one day to obtain by a General Election an absolute majority in the Reichstag, and then, if, as they profess to bolicve, the eontrol of tho Government has in fact been trans-ferred tc tho Reichstag, it will be they who will reap the in-.heritance.    The Liberal papers are slightly&quot; more cautious than the Socialists, and indicate that they are not without appre-hensions as to the fidelity of the Emperor and Hertling to their engagements.    The Hational-Liberals accept the new men, but take the line that the circumstances of their appointment will not constitute a preeedent, that parliamentarisation must not advance further, at any rate during the war.2.      The programme of the Government, as agreed on with the Parties, includes:(1)    Prussian Reform, 1.*. the introduction of equal, direct and secret voting.     (There is already universal suffrage in Prussia).(2)    The abolition of the worst restrictions on the rights of association.(3)    The creation of Arbeitskammern and legal reoog-nition of collective agreements between working-men and employers.(4)    Tho abolition of the politioal censorship, or at any rate the transference of it to the civil authorities.
Ihe second and third of these are, it will be noticed, points which chiefly interest the artisans;   the government has obviously been strongly influenced by apprehensions as to the attitude which might be taken by the soldiers and the munition workers, and, under pressure of tho necessities of the war, thoy ere prepared to go a long way in meeting their demands.     We hear, for instance, of a meeting between ludendorff and representatives of the Trade Unions, in which he showed himself very conciliatory.3.    By far the most important point in the programme it3, however, the reform of the Prussian Constitution;   it is to bo noticed that apparently reform of the Imperial Constitution is for the moment put in the background. If in truth it were established that the responsibility of the Chancellor to the Reichstag is now in fact reeog-nised, the one essential obstacle to parliamentary govern-meat is to be found in the government of Prussia;   if a Bill embodying the promises made by the Smperor, as King of Prussia, is In fact introduced and carried, the Liberals and the Socialists will be confident that the powers of reaction would have been definitely and perma-nently overthrown.    On this, then, all depends.    It is on this Bill that will be fought out the struggle whether the ultimate power in Germany is to continue with the Crown and the Prussian aristocracy;   any compromise will be difficult, and the whole future of Germany may depend on the course which events take.     It may be assumed that the Bill, which is to be introduced this week, will in fact embody the points mentioned above;   it cannot be assumed that it will pass the two Prussian Chambers with-out prolonged and bitter conflict.     Some suspicion has
been aroused by the fact that the Vice-President of ths Ministry, Friedberg, who will presumably have charge of the Bill, was, until recently, opposed to some of its provi-sions.     Suspicions have also been aroused owing to state-mentB that the Bill for the reform of the franchise will be accompanied by measures which will tend to strengthen the control of the Prussian Upper House;   in particular, it is stated that there will be given t6 it power of amending financial bills which it doos not now possess, and that the Itaperor will have tho right of nominating 150 members.4*    There remains the control of foreign policy by the Reichstag.    TO this the liberals and Socialists attach the highost importance;   they strongly adhere to the prin-ciple of non-annexation, whether in the form stated in the July Resolution, or in that of the answer to the Papal Note. On this point there is a serious difforence between them and the National-liberals who remain predominantly annexa-tionist, and will cooperate with the Conservatives.    Very strong criticism has already been aroused by the handling of the Polish question.    As will be remembered, a otate-ment was published in the press to the effect that the German and Austrian Governments had agreed that the Austrian Emperor should declare himself King of Poland, and that the German Emperor should assume sovereignty over Oourland and Lithuania.    This arrangement has been most severely oriticised, first on the ground that it is dia-metrically opposed to the principle of non-annexation, and secondly, because the arrangements were made without con-suiting the Reichstag.    There is much which is obscure about the whole affair, and if the statements were correct,
it is difficult to understand how the German Government were guilty of so gross a blunder, which has at once evoked in the strongest form the criticisms of the conduct of foreign affairs, which have been gaining strength through-out the war.The rule of the Bolsheviks in Russia is not welcomed in Germany; what the Germans want iQ a settled and orderly Government with which they can establish relations, and by agreement with which they oan ultimately reopen commercial and finanoial dealings; it is the Socialists alone who will desire any oordlal response to the present holders of bower.As to procedure, it appears that the Government will first of all introduce a Bill, for Prussian reform, and will then, on the strength of this, ask the Roiohstag tc vote the credits before anything else.5.      The whole situation is one of great interest and will have a direct bearing upon the conclusion of the war.    Obviously German policy is to make certain the necessary changes in the constitution which are long over-due, and if these are successfully carried through, they will then proclaim that thore is no longer any ground for the criticisms addressed against Germany that she does not enjoy self-government as understood among the Allies.    The criticisms made from outside have in fact met with a real response in Germany itself, and there can be little doubt that lerge portions of the nation beliove that they were not without justification, and aro anxious that they should be removed.    Already wo find the German press pointing out that the progress of the war, which is making Germany more democratic, is having a precisely opposite effect in England, America and franco, and there are suggestions
that very soon it is Germany which will be preserving the popu lar rights which have been lost among her enemies.27.11,17.28 ffov:Since the foregoing report was written, the German Wireless have circulated a short statement as to the contents of the Prussian Reform Bill.    Equal, direct and secret ballot is introduced for the Second Chamber.    The age at which the right to vote is acquired is raised from 24 to 25;   the resi-dential qualifications for the suffrage, whioh was 6 months, is now reisod to one year, and it is limited to those who have been Prussian citizens for at least 3 years.    The right of being elected remains as before limited to those over 30 years of age.     The Bill does not appear to contain any scheme foaj redistribution except that 12 large electoral districts are added;   this is presumably to meet the case of the largo towns which, under the present scheme, are much under-represented.The Bill also provides for a reform of the Upper Rouse.    The most important change appears to be that the number of members nominated by the King is raised from  * 45 to 160.
Appendix to AQW/030.DEPARTMENT 07 IJKHBUffXOJfHTELLXGENCS BUREAU.27 Hovember, 1017.THE   RESULTS   0V   THS   SEVENTH GERMAN    WAR    LOAN.The lists of the Seventh German War Loan closed on October 19th, 1917, after a month of very vigorous propaganda. The provisional total is announced at  622,900,000, but not all the subscriptions have yet been received from the Army and overseas, so the total will certainly reaoh  626,000,000. This is  31,000,000 less than the Sixth loan of Maroh 1917, $ but  90,000,000 more than the Fifth loan of September, 1916, and  17,000,000 more than the Third loan of September, 1915. A total of  3,639,600,000 has now been raised in the seven War Loans.Detailed figures, which are available, of the number of subscribers and of subsoriptions of diffsrent amounts, reveal a remarkable contrast with the previous War Loan,    The proportion of large subsoriptions is far greater in the present loan,- and there is an actual increase in the largest subscrip-tions - those over  50,000 - of nearly  40,000,000, in spite 9f the fact that the total subscriptions are smaller than &apos;in the Sixth loan.     It is here that the influence of inflation is most evident.    Small subscriptions up to  50 represent only 6.4$ of the total as compared with 11.8$ in ths Sixth loan, 9.3$ in the fifth loan and 11.2$ in the Third loan. The increasing hardships suffered by those with small incomes would be expected to result in a diminution in their capacity to subscribe to new War Loan issued.
To date Germany has covered by means of funded war loans  3,639,800,000 or 77.44$ out of the total Vote of Credit expenditure of  4,700,000,000.    It must be remembered, however, that the war oosts are continually swelling, and are now at the rate of more than  150,000,000 per month, and that her last tm Yotes of Credit have each been for  760,000,000.     There is a growing surplus of expenditure which cannot be met by means of war loans.    It is not known what total has been reached of Treasury bills outstanding, but there is every reason to believe that it is well over  1,000,000,000.     The inflation of the note issue is also increasing very rapidly.In the seventh Loan the number of small subscribers has fallen off considerably in comparison with the Sixth Loan, a fact which is explained by German newspapers as being partly due to the declihe in country subscriptions owing tc the proceeds of the harvest having not yet come in.    $he Frankfurter Zeitung admits quite openly that the country dwellers have not done as much as they ought in the way of contributions to the War Loan. It is interesting to note that subscribers of between  15 and  100 are fewer than in the Third, Fifth and Sixth Loans, while, on the other hand, large subscribers of over   5,000 are oon-siderably more numerous than in the smaller Sixth Loan.    The big munition firms are subscribing an increasing proportion of the succeeding war loans.    There seems to be a growing amount of evidonoe that many persons in Germany feel alarmed at the amount of war loan stock which they hold, and are seeking, by the purchase of large quantities of jewellery, by taking up mortgages in cities, and in other ways, to find an alternative investment for some of their money.^Hi&quot;Note: As regards the purchase of jewellery as a mode of investment, the Government has recently been calling upon owners of jewellery to dispose of it to the State, in exchange for Government scrip, and it is consequently probable that private investments in this form of property are diminishing.
IJote.   It has been pointed out that to some extent the increased issue of notes i3 probably due to the necessity for providing currency in the occupied territories;   to this extent the increase could not be corrootly described as being due merely to inflation.The German papers regard the Seventh War Loan as a very great success, and emphasise, with considerable justifiea-tion, the fact that the internal condition of the country, owing to the Chancellor oriels, to the scandals disclosed as to the mutiny in the fleet, etc, could hardly be considered favourable to the raising of a big loan.    The results of the Seventh War Loan are certainly significant as affording proof of the deter-mination of the German people to carry on the war and as showing that the internal credit of the German JEtopire is as yet not seriously impaired.    The financial position after the war is undoubtedly causing a great deal of anxiety, but so long as the army is still able to keep victories up its sleeve and produce them when wanted, and so long as it suffers no very disastrous defeat in the field, it does not seem likely that it will bo unable to obtain the funds necessary for the prose-cution of the war.The facility with which Germany is able to raise these great loans every six months is certainly remarkable, but it must be remembored (a) that the currency is very rapidly being inflated;   more than  250,000,000 of notes have been put into circulation since the beginning of 1917, and the total circulation now stands above  $8oo,000,00611^ ih) that the funds invested in the war loans are largely the proceeds of the pro-cess of liquidation of much of her national v/oalth during the war.    Her stocks of raw materials and manufactures have been used up and have not been replaced, her reserves of food stuffs have been consumed, her soil exhausted, her machinery and plant worn out.    The sole opportunity for the investment of much of
the liquid capital thus created has &quot;been the War Loans, in which are now locked up a very large part of the &quot;replacement fund&quot; which will he required by German industry and commerce after the war.    The making of these funds available after the war is one of the most urgent of the problems whioh the German Government will have to face after the war.    It has announced that it proposes to retain the existing Loan Offices for a oon-siderable period after the war, and to enable them, with the aid of the Keiobsbank and the whole banking system, to grant loans against war loan stock, to an almost unlimited extent, at a low rate of interest.    It Is true that it is quite possible that this could be done, but it involves an enormous inflation of the already inflated German currency., with a corresponding effect in depreciating its value both at home and abroad.The actual amount of new money received is appre-ciably less than appears from the official figures.    The Savings Banks contribute large sums to the loans, but before each new loan their clients are the largest sellers of old loan even at a loss.    It falls on the Heichsbank to maintain the market for War Loan, and it is the sole buyer on a large scale.     It accepts the stock of Banks old loans at     below issue price, and it buys officially as much as  50,000 daily on the Berlin Stock Exchange.    However, when the sales are more abundant, especially for the account of the Savings Banks, it does not hesitate to absorb an even greater quantity in order to prevent too much being offered on the market. Every obstacle is thrown in tho way of the public, if it wishes to dispose of War Loan.    If any one is in absolute necessity for money, he is sent to the Loan Offices to borrow on his War Loan;   If he id determined to sell, his orders are executed slowly and only for very small quantities.     Hence, in time of w*r, at least, the possession of war loan stock
is by no moans free from disadvantages;  while, on the other side, the Roiohsbanlc is compelled to have an ever increasing recourse to its note issue in order to maintain the market for old war loans.
