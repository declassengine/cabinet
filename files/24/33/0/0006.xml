5(This Document is ine Prr?4tnnic IVv-; Priority,From:   Brigadier General BallardJassy,19th November,&apos;7ToC.I.G.S.   Repeated M.A. Petrograd.30B.A.804.I have to-day had a long interview With General Berthelot. He drafted the following telegram with which I entirely agree.   He has sent it to the French War Office and has sent via French wireless a copy to you in my name.   I send this in confirmation. Pleaae. let me know your views.The interruption of communications with our representative in Petrograd makes me think that the Bolchevicks and the Provisional Government united are treating a separate peace which will some day cone as a surprise to us and which unfortunately will he hailed with joy &quot;by all Russian troops.   Already in the 6th Army, to v/hose had morale I have often called your attention, a division has abandoned its trenches and a Roumanian division has had to take its place.I am seeing General Tcherbstcheff to protest in the name of the Allied Armies against the criminal apathy and recognised incapacity of General Zurichoff, who command   the 6th Army.    I am asking for his removal as well as that of his Chief of the Staff and the Oommissaire of the Provisional Government attached to his army.If Russia concludes a separate peace or if the Russian troops simply abandon the front, the Roumanian troops alone v/ill not be able to resist the enemy&apos;s forces and the Government and Roumanian army will either have to make peace or retire to Besparabia. The King and the Government have decided to stand by the Allies to the end.   But if Russia makes a separate peace and continues to live in her present state of anarchy the passage of the Roumanian Army into Bessarabia seems to be impossible;   nothing having been prepared for this army1s reception it would certainly die there of cold and hunger.    Under the circumstances,  the only solution I eventually see is the disbandment of the Roumanian army after complete destruction of all arms, munitions of war and war material.   No capitulation would be signed.    The King and Government could withdraw and in this case it is probable that they would go to America via Vladivostock.To maintain as much as possible in Roumania an atmosphere favourable to the Entente, they might remain in the country surrendering to the enemy without conditions.   At present moment I am of opinion that the time has come for the Allies to abandon their policy of neutrality towards the internal agitations in Russia and that they must take action against the Bolchevioks by informing them that any measures tending to bring about this abandonment of the (? publication of) any transactions with the enemy, or even the (? covering) of these measures in the absence of any sanction will be considered as official treason.   I beg to ask you,, after having thought over the situation, to communicate to see your view on the whole of the above-mentioned points,    I am In entire agreement with General Ballard, representing the British Army in Roumania who is firing to his Government in the same sense as myself (?) to-day.
