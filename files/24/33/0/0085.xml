This Document is the Property ofColonel Joness Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)AIR-RAIDS,Provision of Cover in London.With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 3, I submit a memorandum with a covering letter from the Commissioner of Polioe on the pregress made in providing air-raid shelter.It will be seen that there is now bomb-proof shelter in London for about 300.000 persons and splinter-proof shelter for another million persons, but much of the splinter-proof shelter needs strengthening.     The Commissioner proposes that the work of seleoting and strengthening the splinter-proof shelter should be entrusted to the local authorities in the Metropolitan Police District, i.e. the Borough and Distriot Councils, subject to the oon-trol of the London Air-Raids Shelter Committee, whs are willing to accept the responsibility for the decisions which may be taken.     He also advises that the local authorities be permitted to requisition sand-bags for the above purpose up to a total of 2^- million bags, subject to the requisitions being endorsed by the President of the Shelter Committee.     The total cost of these bags is estimated at  25,000.The cost of providing further bomb-proof shelter is estimated at not less than  3 per head.     The Commissioner is of opinion that apart from cost it is impossible at the present moment to provide such shelter for the population of London and that it is not desirable to proceed further in that direction.The Committee appeinted by the Cabinet approve the above suggestions and reoommend -1.   That the local authorities in the Metropolitan Police District be asked to undertake the duty of selecting the air-raid shelters and strengthening them where necessary, subject to the directions of the London Air-raids Shelter Committee,2.   That for the above purpose the local authorities be authorized to requisition sand-bags up to an average of 20,000 bags per authority or 2^ million bags in all, the requisitions to be countersigned by the President of the Advisory Committee;3.   That in consideration of the local authorities providing thp -.. neoeBsary labour and supervision, no&apos; charge to be made for the bags.G. CAVE.&apos;7th November, 1917.
NEW SCOTLAND ..XAKD, S.W.1. ;&quot;  &apos;: :: - 13th November, 1917.Sir, ;    .. ,   .. ,. .; ,. , -In Memoranda which were submitted by. the Home Secretary to the War Cabinet, I represented that an Advisory Committee, tonsisting of Surveyors and Officers of the Rcyal Engineerst under the presidency of Sir Alexander Stenning, was at work making enquiries on the spot into the nature, amount and distribution of Air Raid Shelters.At my instance they have concentrated upon a typical area, viz. the &quot;K&quot; or Bow Division of tho Metropolitan Police -District.     As. this Division includes Limehouse. East and West Ham, the Isle of Dogs, Poplar, Bow, Forest Cats, Plaistow, Canning .Town, North Woolwich,., Ilford, Barking, Chadwell Heath and Dagenham-.it may be considered a typiaal area for it includes areas with a dense residential population of the working class which are oentres of industry, and areas.where the residential population are of the working class but which are not centres of industry.The Advisory Committee.^ treatment of this area may be accepted as applic able to all similar areas.Their recommendations in. respect of this area are complete., and are embodied in the several reports of their Sub-Committees.1 have, in the Minute accompanying this letter, set out briefly the points upon which the Homo Secretary will wish to have the&apos; directions of the War Cabinet.     Such directions, which will include Sanction for money expend-iture, are necessary, as, until the Local Authorities are assured that they will not have to shoulder the whole cost, they will not be willing to take further action.I have not data upon whioh to frame an.estimate of expenditure but assum-ing that the War Office will be able to sell these bags at 3d each - a million bags would cost 512,500.     If on the average each Local Authority is allowed to requisition for 20,000 bags - the actual number used up would only be about 2-jjf millitn bags costing  25,000.In the ciroumstanoes, the. War Cabinet may be willing to give personal sanction to a .supply of 2g- million bags issued by the War Offioe upon requisi-tions signed by Looal Authorities and; oountersigned by the President of the Advisory Committee.It oan be settled later what proportion of: the cost of these bags shall fail upon the local rates.I am,.he; Under Secretary &quot;of &apos;Sf h+p Home Office, S.W.I.   tateSir,Your obedient Servant,&apos; :    &apos; (Signed) E. R. HENRY,LBTTER FROM THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE.
The Advisory Committee consisting of Members of the Institute of Surveyors, all men *f standing in their profession and Officers of the Royal Engineers deputed by General Headquarters, Home Forces, have been assiduously employed since the 19th October,in making enquiry into the amount and nature of the Air Raid Shelter available in the Metropolitan Pelioe District.At my instance they have concentrated attention on a typical area known as the K or Bow Division which has a population .*f 724,000.     In the Metropolitan Police District there are 21 Divisions popularly knewn by the Alphabetical letters assigned to them.     Of these the K Division is one; from the Committee*s report a copy of whioh is attached, it will be Been that in their opinion the amount of Air Raid Shelter in this Division is adequate.    This report does not eay whether its distribution is satisfactory, but this Information for the whole area I am having compiled by obtaining for each of the 200 Station Areas conBtit** uting the Metropolitan Police District, a separate map or plan on which ic marked the site and the amount of accommodation afforded by the buildings selected as Air Raid Shelters.Air Raid Shelter is of two kinds - Bomb proof and Splinter proof.     The Tube Stations, 86 in number, the Blaokwall- Rotherhithe^ Greenwich and Woolwich Tunnels, certain Goods Depots, Warehouses and Faotories may be soheduled as bomb proof and the accommodation of this character now available is not less than sufficient for 300,000 persons and is on the whole well distributed.In addition there is splinter proof shelter available for another million persons.    Some of this accommodation may on oloaer inspection be rejected, but if it is rejected, it will be replaced.     It is safe, in my judgment, tc estimate that accommodation of this nature pronounced after inspection to be satisfactory will be available for fully on&amp; million persons.    Now while nearly all the splinter proof shelter provisionally scheduled is suitable, the Advisory Committee, represent that much of it will need strengthening.     They do not contemplate the need of structural changes being carried out or indeed anything more than providing sandbags to protect windows and other orifices.In connection with the use of sandbags it becomes necessary to decide what agency shall be employed to determine the number required in each local area and to undertake the task of placing them in position.For dealing with this work over so great an area it is obviously desirable to decentralise as far as possible, utilising any agency that may be in existence. The suggestion put forward is that this agency everywhere sheuld be the Local Authority, i.e. the Borough Council or Urbafc or Rural District Council.    These, in the aggregate, number 129.    The Surveyors to the Looal Authorities may not be willing t* assume the responsibility of deciding whether the shelters already aoheduled are suitable and sufficiently strong for their purpose.    The Advisory
Committee therefore are prepared to advise, thereby accepting responsibility for the decision arrived at.    They are further prepared to draw up t &amp; working rules for the guidance of the Local Surveyors laying down the requirements which must be.met by any building before it can be deemed suitable as an Air Raid Shelter, and it is hoped that if these rules and directions are well set mxt, the local &quot;Surveyors will be able to determine to thair own satisfaction, whether their buildings are, as shelters, satisfactory,, reserving for the judgment cf the Advisory Committee only a relatively small number of doubtful oases.In this connection it becomes necessary to settle what financial help the Looal Authorities will receive from the State, and what facilities will be provided to enable them to get the sandbags and other materials needed.    Unless some proportion of the expenditure is laid upon local funds it will be difficult to ensure economical administrationIt has to be borne in mind that it is in the poorest localities that the need for Shelter accommodation is greatest.     The determination of what proportion of the total expenditure should fall upon the rates is one for the Looal Government Board.     Pending their award the Looal Authorities might be told that they will reoeive a subsidy from the State to assist them in providing suitable shelters, the exaot amount of which ?;ill be duly notified to them.     As it is not desirable to have all these Authorities competing against each other for   sandbags in the open market, the suggestion is that the War Office be authorised to instruct Contractors to supply Looal Authorities, at a specified price with the number of sandbags requisitioned by them, their requisitions being countersigned by the President cf the Advisory Committee after necessary sorutiny.If the above proposals meet with the approval of the War Cabinet, steps can be taken to carry them out without delay. 1E.R.H.    ,    ..     -   13/11/17.
