(Secretary).TIE COMMITTEE had before them two communications from the Army Council and the Secretary of tho r.ar Cabinet -(1) G.T, 2621 dated the 9th November, 1917.(2) Army Council Memorandum fto.5/Bills/1494, and also a letter from the Ad jut ant-General to Sir Edward Cor son outlining the difficulties that would occur in tho admini strati on of discipline in certain cases where Airmen serving with an Expeditionary Force were subject to Air Force Ian and not military Law, and where the maintenance of discipline would be difficult in the event of it being necessary to try Airmen by Air Officers when Airmen are detached from Air Force units.The main argument submitted by representatives of the Air Force and strongly supported by ADMIRAL MARK KERR and COMMODORE PAINE was tnat if the amendment proposed by the Army Council were inserted in the Bill, the Air Force when serving with an Kxpeditionary Forco would be placed in a subordinate position tc the fiavy and the Army, whereas the whole object cf the Bill is to create a now co-equal force entirely separate from the ilavy and the Army.GM-IERAL SIR DAVID MIDERSOK pointed out that in his opinion it was essential to the discipline of tho future Air Force that discipline should be administered by tho Officers of the Air Force and that the ultimate authority shouldrest
rest with them.   The Military Commender-in-Chief would of course be over the Air Force Commander attached to him, and would have poorer to dismiss him, and under these circumstances he was of opinion that no difficulty would arise should the Bill remain as it stands.ADMIRAL MARK K&amp;RR stated that the Navy agreed with the position taken up by tho Air Board; they had had experience in the pant in&quot; tbe Navy bearing out wnat was stated by Sir David Vendorson. in the position formerly occupied by Eiwneer Officers.,   in times past these mhgineer Officers had no power to punish the men under them, and consequently discipline had not been satisfactory; now that disciplinary authority had been given to Engineer Officers matters \7cro much improved without in any way impairing the authority of discipline maintained by Naval Oificers under whom tne Enginoor&quot;Officers wore serving.C0I1I0D0B2 PAINS pointed out that the Royal ilaval Air Scrvieo in France had been throughout the war under the Ilaval Discipline Act, and not under the Army Act.   YJhile the IUKA,u. were Quito willing to be placed under Air Force Law, thov felt some mis-dying at&quot; being placed under1 i. OvJ. V   JJiAW -LORD HUGH CECIL pointed cut that nineteen-twentieths of Air Force Lawwas tho seme as Military Law but that tho additional twentieth was most important, this twentieth dealt specifically with Air offences, regarding which military officers had no ezpeuence, and which could only be tried with justice by Air For*e Officers.   In his opinion anything that tended to reduce the status of tho Air Force as a separate independent service from tho Army was mischievous.LORD CRAITFORD emphasised the point put up by the Ad jut ant- General, viz.   that cases mipht arise where men of the Air Force end the Army might be charged with -a similar offence, for instance, street brawling.   If tho amendment proposed by the Army Council were not inserted these men vrould have%to be tried by separate courts or separate officers for identically the same offence and different punishments iven in the two cases,   In his opinion this would be bad or the discipline both of the Air Force and the Army arid would load to groat confusion.In reference to what was stated by Commodore Paine, GENERAL SIR NEVILLE MACRSADY stated that from his experience as D.A.G. in France, there had been great trouble in Dunkirk end elsewhere owing to the fact that certain officers and men were under the Naval Discipline Act. while others were under the Army Act, and ho fearod that similar difficulties and friction would ariso by the establishment of Air Force Lag in addition to tho two other systems of discipline,LORD HUGH CFCIL thought that there might be a way out of tho difficulty if vide powers of regulation could be given to the Air Council, these regulations could be built up as a result of experience, and where it was found necessary to suspend Air Force Law in favour 0fMilitary
Military Larr in specific instances or classes of instances this could be clone under regulations by the Air Council acting in co-operation v/ith the Amy Council^T1S C0H,iITT32 decided to request Sir ITrcdorick Liddell todray an oruendiieiit for the purpose of giving effect to . this last proposal, for filial&quot; approval by Sir Ednard Carson, and tnat subject to suen&apos;approval recommended the moving of the amendment in the&quot;House of Lords0(Initialled). .\7,0-G,Secretary.2, Y/hitehall Gardens, 24th November, 1917,
