OPERATIONS *Prom: General Barter, Russia. &apos; Despatched- 28.11.17.Received 1,20 p.m. 28.11.17To:     C.I.G.S., Ear Office.Repeated Ambassador.&apos;Caucasus Military Agent. General Ballard, Roumania.No.1386.   Nov.25th.Quarter Master General informs me that Commander-in-Chief v.Test Front at Minsk has been arrested by front revolutionary committee Krilenko has arrived at Dwinsk and v*e hourly expect to hear that he has opened up peace negotiations with Germans.     It is considered certain that Germans will accept proposals. At these headquarters local troops and committees are loyal to General Dukhonin, though they are dissatisfied with his lack of decision and authority.   Measures have finally been taken to prevent Krilenko from coming here.South-Western and Roumania fronts are so, far loyal., as are Cossacks and Ukraines. but it is feared that if the north and west fronts conclude peace or armistice Roumania will at once make best possible terms she can with Germans, which will force Ukraines to compromise with Bolsheviks.     I am informed that a parlementaire from Roumania has already left Jassy for front. Arrangements have been made by the Commander-In-Chief to transfer these headquarters to. Kursk, accompanied by the local troops which number about a division.   Foreign Missions will be instructed to accompany him.
