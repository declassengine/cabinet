GERMAN CLAIMS OF SUCCESS OF SUBMARINE WARFARE DURING OCTOBER 1917.

Memorandum for the War Cabinet by First Lord of the Admiralty.

The following is the German Official report of the success of Submarine Warfare during the month of October: it was issued ? German Government through its wireless stations on the 23rd November :-

"In the month of October, by the War measures of the

"Central Powers, a total of 674,000 gross registered tons

"of mercantile ship-space for the use of our enemies has

"been sunk. The former successes obtained as a result of

"unrestricted Submarine warfare have been thus increased to

"7,649,000 gross registered tons".

An examination of these claims gives the following result :-

Actual Results. German Claims. Gorman Exaggeration.

OCTOBER 1917. GROSS TONS.

Sunk .. British 268,980

Allied 123,543

Neutral 54,207            446,730

Damaged.

British 74,564

Allied 18,436

Neutral 7,000             100,000

                          546,730                 674,000                 24%

Since

1st FEBRUARY 1917.

(Beginning of unrestricted Submarine Warfare).

Sunk British 3,142,766

Allied 1,000,577

Neutral 974.932

5,118,275

Damaged:

British 715,433

Allied 135,292

Neutral 131,000

981,725

6,100,000 7,649,000 25%

In making the above calculations, the British, Allied, and Neutral vessels damaged have been taken into account because the enemy has some text for thinking that they may have been sunk; but even then and owing? for losses by mine, the claims are overstated roughly by 25%.
