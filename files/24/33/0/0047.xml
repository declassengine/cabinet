209SJ:CRlfl.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BPV/021.Ueekly Heport on PoUmu.   XXI. (24th ITovember, 1*17.)The Central Powers and the Polish ftuestion.1.     The Crown Council which was held in Berlin on November 5 and admittedly dealt with tho Polish Question was alleged to have assigned Poland to Austria, Lithuania and Courland to Germany. Dementis followed.     These are the conclusions to be derived from the Austrian official statements about the results of the Berlin Conferences.ilo final decision haa as yet been reached in the Polish Question, but the German Government no longer vetoes a union of Ruosian Poland with Galicia.     This union, however, is not to be carried out unless this is the wish of the Polish nation.     Also the consent of wother factors&quot; is yet required - presumably of the German, Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments.2.     One oannot gather from the official Austrian statements whether or not vthe consent of the German Government is made dependent on a similar union being established between Lithuania, Courland and Prussia.     Dr. Adler, the leader of the German Socialists in the Austrian Parliament, declared it &quot;unthinkable both for political and strategical reason? that Germany should agree to a dynastic union between Austria-Hungary and Poland unless a similar connection is established simultaneously between Prussia, Courland and Lithuania&quot;.     He meant thereby to point out that the plans discussed at the Berlin Conference would raise serious obstacles to peace, as Russia can hardly be expected to
abandon Lithuania or Courland.     The Austrian Premier, Dr. yon Seidler, avoided entering upon the subject but assured the House that &quot;in no case can the Polish Question form an obstacle to peace, because violence is out of the question&apos;&apos;.It is obviously to the interest of the Austrian Government to dissociate the Polish settlement from the question of Lithuania and Courland, and to let the idea take root among the Poles that they will be free to establish a union of Russian Poland and Galicia - and thus,if there are any restricting conditions on such a union ;to kill them by silence.3.     German consent to a union of Russian Poland and Galicia means a sudden reversal of the policy which in one form or another had been steadily pursued by the German Government 3ince the outbreak of the war and of which the Acts of tfovember 5 and September 12, 1917, were the most significant expressions.     The disadvantages of such a union from the point of view of Germany are obvious.     A reunion of these two parts of Poland and national liberty within them, would settle Poland&apos;s claims against Russia and Austria, and render still more pointed and still more pressing her claims against Germany.     At the same time Polish influence would increase within the Ha,bsburg Monarchy, Germany^ only reliable ally.     She will need that ally also in future, for it must be clear to any thinking German that Russiafs collapse can be only temporary - nothing can destroy either the size of theRussian Empire or the numbers of the Russian nation.     Should \he-feclipseeellapnc last even for a whole generation, it can yet hardly enter as a dominant factor into schemes of which the effects will extend over centuries.     It may be that Germany counts on giving an anti-Russian front to the new Poland and through it also to the entire Habsburg Monarchy, by making Poland include East Galicia, Eastern Cholm and possibly also parts of Volhynia, all of them Little Russian land, and the White Russian province of Grodna.
But this idea is not a new factor; it has &quot;been present for the last two years.4.     Hoy/ then is? the sudden change to be e:qolained?    iTo answer or even attempt at an answer is to be found in any of the official or Bemi-official statements, nor even in the newspaper comment *It is however safe to assume that the action of the German Government is the result of an intricate oombination of reasons, and that it gambles on a oomplicated aystem of chances.     In the first place its consent is probably only half-sincere.    For one reason or another, probably with a view to striking a bargain on Central European Union, they may specially wieh to satisfy Vienna at the present moment and to get rid of the disturbing factor which the Polish Question hao been hitherto - Austria^ demands are known to havo been specially urgent during recent months. Still it very likely is part of the German calculation that the scheme will yet suffer shipwreck against one of the numerous rocks in its path.     It is further possible that now for the first time the Germans believe in the possibility of detaching Lithuania and Courland from Russia.     If they succeed in bringing these provinces within their sphere of influence, they v/ould naturally have to concede the Habsburg demands with regard to Poland, especially if these find acceptance from the Polea. themselves. Another facior of which the influence may have toldJi,n the matter is the Vatican, the German Catholics and Hertling.    The new German scheme is in accordance with Roman Catholio interests. Moreover the difficulties which are bound to ariee in Austria if in her Parliament dissatisfied Galician Poles Join hands with the other Slav nationalities cannot fail to have impressed the German statesmen, who during recent months may have recognised the practical wisdom of the past Aurnrian policy of gaining a free hand towards the other Slavs by bribing the Poles.     Lastly,
the development of Polish politics since November 5 1916 has un-doubtedly proved to the Germans that a semi-dependent Poland under a joint Austro-German protectorate may prove an even greater nuisance to Germany and an even greater danger to Austro-German relations than a Poland comfortably embedded in the Habsburg Honarchy.5.     Srom the polish point of view there is practically no exception to be raised to the new scheme as preaented by Count Caernin and Er. von Seidler.     The scheme is not to be forced on the Poles, but new possibilities are opened to them.    The mere fact that the idea of reunion between Russian and Austrian Poland should have been publicly admitted by the Central Powers   makes it practically a reality in international politics - the ilntente not being opposed to any degree of national reunion - and the joining of these two parts advances Poland a good way towards complete reunion.    Should the war in Eastern Europe be ooncluded under such circumstances that the Poles would have to choose between a semi-independent Kingdom without Galicia and under the joint protectorate of the Central Powers,, and a Poland consisting of Russian Poland and Galicia under a Habsburg, there can hardly be any doubt that they would ohoose the latter.    $ut if the war goes against the Central Powers, the fact that this proposal should now have been offered to the Poles can hardly exclude more favourable solutions.6.    The dark side of the soheme appears in its relation to internal Austrian and Galician politics.     It is the logical out-come of the policy initiated by Vienna and the Galician Poles during the period 1867-1873.     Austria gives freedom to the Poles and with it dominion over the Little Russians of East Galicia, as it has given to the Magyars their own freedom and dominion over the non-Magyar nationalities of Hungary.     In exchange the Poles deliver the Czechs and Jugoslavs into the hands of the Austrian
Germans. Little Russians (ujcrainians) of East Galicia willbe a hopeless minority in Pola.il. the Czechs and Jugoslavs in Auntria.     Hence these t^ree &quot;submerged nationalities&quot; violentlyoppose the scheme.\;hen the news from 3erlin reached Vienna, these nationalities at once demanded a debate in the Austrian Parliament, and rvere supported therein by the Roumanians and even the German Socialists. The Poles joined hands with the German Nationalist8 and Clericals in opposing such a debate.     But it was soon discoverer that the Polish-German combination, whioh Under normal circumstances can muster a slight majority in the house, was not present in Vienna in sufficient strength to do so on this occasion.     A debate had to be admitted.     In the course of it the Ukrainians made a passionate protest against being delivered into the hands of their &quot;hereditary enemies, the Poles&quot;, whilst the Czechs and Jugoslavs appealed to the Poles to ooncede to the Ukrainians that right to self-determination which they demand for themselves, and further not to abandon the Czechs and Jugoslavs, but to make common cause with them and to try to gain simultaneously liberty for all the Slav nationalities of Austria-iiungary.     The aoting President of the Polish Club ooldly answered that appeal by protesting against any connection between the Polish Question and the cause of the other nationalities, and asserted the Polish claim to the whole of Galicia.    Just as the representative of the German National-lets, he described the debate as untimely.    Having been unable to prevent it, the Poles and German iTationaliste shirked it.The Polish Club, which consists of five different groups, has not got a President at present,   but its five Vice-presidents, the leaders of the different groups, in turn hold office, each for one week.     It so happened that now the turn had come of M. Glombinski, the leader of the least numerous group, the National Democrats, who hold merely 8 out of 78 Polish seats in
the Austrian Parliament.     That the leader of those who claim to be the fiercest anti-Germans amon,., the Poles, should have found himself on the same side v/ith the German Nationalists adds point to the situation, aid shows whither Polish Imperialism is bound to lead.     And of all the Polish parties none is keener than the National Democrats on asserting Polish dominion over the Little Russians of Last Galicia.7.    The opposition of the Little Russian (Ukrainian) members deserves attention.    One of them was to confer with the Austrian Premier on some other question but on receiving the news about the Berlin Conference, he refused to do so, declaring that his nationality has nothing more to seek in Austria now that Austria wishes to &quot;deliver them into the hands of their hereditary enemies&quot;.    Their ohief spokesman in the debate in the Austrian Parliament on November y went even further and appealed directly to the Uitente to preserve the Ukrainians from subjection to the Poles: &quot;Vfe are not altogetherwithout hope........... It will not be by the Central Powersalone that the conditions of peace will be dictated........... andnot merely our own brothers (the Russian Ukrainians), but also the representatives of other nations, even of nations against whioh our soldiers are now fighting, will defend us againstviolence............M     uV/e are told,&quot; said yet another Ukrainianmember, &quot;that the Poles will ^rant us national autonomy.     Por five long centuries the Poles have had^to show their brotherly love.     It was an endless struggle, and this struggle will con-tinue if we are included in Poland.9It is certain that the Little Russians of last Oallcia will fight to the last man rather titan submit to Polish rule.
Russian Poland.8.     The Regency Council has been received with respect but without enthusiasm.     A year&apos;8 experience has taught people not to expect too much.     Prom the very outset it was generally recognised that the task of the Regency Council will be a very difficult one.     The question of choosing a Premier has supplied the first practical exampie.     The Regency Council twice put forward the demand that Count Adam Tarncvaki should be accepted for that office, but met each time with a German refusal.    Prince Alexander Drucki-Lubecki was the chosen man of the Germans, and for this very reason was unacceptable to the Regency Council, the vast majority of the Poles and probably also to Austria.     Finally, the Regents have put forward the name of M. Jan Kncharzewski whohowever does neither for good nor for bad stand on a level with Count Adam Tarnowski.    Kucharzewski iB a man of undoubted honesty and ability, a sincere adherent of Polish independence (for this reason he refused during the first part of the war to have any dealings with the Supreme National Committee of Galicia), but he is not a statesman and has hardly any practical experience of politics.     By his own-friends he was given the nickname of the &quot;virtuous paralytic&quot; - owin:; to an excess of virtue he can never make up his mind to take any strong action.   He is likely to pursue a policy of caution in relations with the Central Powers, and of conciliation towards all Polish political parties, barring the Rational Democrat party machine - he is a political and personal enemy of its leaders.     He himself had originally belonged to the national Democrat party, but left them when they entered into an alliance with the Russian reactionary groups.9.     The further course of politics in Poland will of course be dominated by the further development of the scheme for resuscitating the &quot;Austrian Solution&quot;.     The three Regents are
24.11.17.reported to have gone to Berlin and Vienna to discuss the situation. The work of creating the Polish Government and the nucleus of a Polish army is certain to continue.     The upper and middle classes in Poland will not allow themselves to be caught unprepared by peace when almost two million Polish peasants and workmen will return from Russia, men who will have seen the Russian Revolution, will have heard the cry about &quot;the land for the people&quot; and v/ill have imbibed many socialist ideas - even Bolshevism is growing in Russia also among the Poles.     If a government and an army are now formed in Poland, they are meant for war against the spirit of the Russian Revolution, rather than against Russia.
