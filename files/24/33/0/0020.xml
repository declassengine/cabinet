.--Victoria 8240/ ThtSTelegrams:-Growmore, Sowest, LoNDOX.777i aw/rf ^/ay, address all covimunications to :-The Director General.FOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1)21st November, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following report on the work ofthe Pood Production Department for the v;eek ended 20th November:-sioners indicate that improved yjeathcr conditions prevailed generally throughout the country last week, and that good pro-gress was accordingly made in ploughing and seeding as well as in harvesting roots and potatoes.    In the West of England, however, and in Wales, fog and the absence of drying winds have prevented the land from recovering from the recent heavy rains, and consequently in these areas ploughing was possible only on the lighter soils.Kent - The Committee have given directions for the ploughing up of 50 acres of land on the Hengrove Golf Course. Leicestershire - The Committee have been authorised to take pos-session of a neglected farm of 120 acres, of which 43 acres are arable, together with two adjoining arable fields of 12 acres. Part of the buildings will be uswd as a depot for horses and implements to be hired out to adjoining farmers for breaking up grass land.Lincoln (Kesteven) - A scheme has been sanctioned under which the Committee will take possession of 133 acres of grass land atThe Weather.The latest reports received from the District Commis-LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.Agricultural Executive Committees.
Hough belonging to- three -different farmers, and will farm the land themselves as a single unit.   97 acres of this land are held by a man farming at a distance, merely for the purposes of grass keep; and it was found impossible to get any part of the area broken up by the tenants.Northamptonshire - Two farms, which together comprise 230 auras, occupied by Messrs. Pain, Ltd. principally for the pur-pose of getting the ironstone, are in a very dirty and neg-looted state.   The Committee have been given authority to take possession of these farms, exclusive of 15 acres actually, being worked for ironstone, and of any other land which is likely to be so worked in the near future. Surrey - It having been found impossible to induce Lord Cunliffe to plough up 175 acres of land belonging to him which had been derelict for many years, the Committee have been authorised to take possession of the land and to let it at a nominal rent to a tenant who will reclaim it for cultiva-tion.Yorkshire, North Riding - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of 58 acres of arable land on a farm of 136 acres near Liverton.   The cultivation will be carried out by the incoming tenant at his own expense.   A change of tenancy will take place on 13th May, 1918, and the arable land would not be cultivated but for the above arrangement. Drainage of land - The Norfolk Committee are serving notices under the Drainage of Lands Orders for the cleansing of marsh-land ditches in various parts of the county, near Honing, Aldborough, Worstead, and Great Melton.   They have modified their orders regulating the flow of water through mills on the Waveney in accordance with the recommendations of the Depart-ment.Damage by Game - Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Norfolk and Westmorland, and under the Pheasants Order from Norfolk.
Offences against the Regulations.,- A farmer of 900 acres of land near Market Harborough in Northampton nire has been fined  25 and  5.8.0. costs for failing to comply with an order to plough up 35 acres of an outlying farm before 1st October, 1017.   The defence was that the harvest had not been completed in time and that the ploughing had been done since the date specified.   Mr. Walton of New House Farm, Etchingham, has been fined  50 and  10.10.0. costs for failing to vacate the farmhouse, of which the East Sussex Committee had taken possession on behalf of the Board.Determination of Tenancies - During the week 10 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad*farming in respect of 784 acres, and 3 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 199 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Demonstrations in Fruit Preserving - The demand for Demonstra-tions in Drying and Bottling continues.   The number given during the past week being 31.   Of the small Canning Stations established to demonstrate the value of canning as a local war industry, the station at Cheltenham is now dealing with 800 cans of fruit (apples) per day, and the accounts shew that work can be carried on at a fctfy margin of profit. Spraying - 8 manufacturers have agreed to produce and put on the market next year Knapsack Spraying Machines embodying im-provements suggested by the Department, and they have further agreed t&apos;6 sell machines at a uniform price.Large Scale Piulb Preserving   - Negotiations have been carried on with the British Farina Company which firm has selected mills at King&apos;s Lynn and Boston for the purpose of putting down plant for both Farina and Potato Flour.   This firm is also inspecting premises at Montrose, Dundee, Cambridge and
Belfast,     Similar arrangements are in course of negotiation withother substantial firms.The question of the use of buildings occupied by the Confectionery Trade for the manufacture of Potato Flour is under consideration.     The Trade is at present almost at a standstill, and if the premises occupied by it prove suitable, a large quantity of potatoes can be preserved.The Demonstration plant at Meux&apos;s Brewery is now in working order.Pulping^       Pulping still continues in the West of England and arrangements are being made for the controlled jam firms to take over the whole of the pulp made by the Department at cost price.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Arsenate of Lead.   Owing to the scarcity of lead, an enquiry has been made into possible substitutes for arsenate of lead for spraying purposes, but so far no substance has been found which is a satisfactory substitute.     In the circumstances, arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Munitions to release the estimated quantity of lead required for the manufacture of spraying materials.     As, however, the lead situation may become more serious, the Department is arranging for further work as regards substitutes. &apos;Canker Disease of Parsnips.   Experiments on this disease, which last season caused very serious losses, have been concluded. Investigations have shown that canker in the first instance is due to the surface tissues of the roots becoming ruptured during the growing season, and in the most badly affected districts, the trouble is believed to have been aggravated by neglect of liming, lack of proper rotation, and over-manuring.     Directions on the Subject are being issued for the information of growers. Feeding of Dairy Cows.   A leaflet on &quot;Economy in the Feeding of Dairy Cows,r has been published.     Leaflets have now been issued on the economical feeding of horses, dairy cows, calves and pigs. p leaflet on the feeding of cattle is being prepared.
Utilisation of Stray? in the Manufacture of Paper.     In connection with the expected large surplus of straw in 1918, enquiries have been in progress as regards the practicability of extending the use of straw in industry.     The two most promising outlets are in the manufacture of paper and strawboards.     The Ministry of Munitions are taking steps to encourage the use of straw in the making of strawboards.     As regards paper, this Department, in co-operation with the Royal Commission on Paper, is making enquiry as to the existing plant in possession of manufacturers capable of dealing with straw, and also as to the possible means of increasing the use of straw in the paper industry. Seed Testing Station.    Samples of seed for testing are beginning to arrive, and during the week 6 samples from wholesale merchants, 8 from retail merchants and 13 from farmers were received.LABOUR DIVISIOH. Soldier Labour.   During the week, 796 further men for the 1918 programme arrived at the Distribution Centres, making a total to date of 27,072 men supplied out of the 43,000 to be made available. Some of the men originally supplied for harvest work and now remaining for the 1918 programme have been reclassified during the week and accepted as skilled; making the total of so-called &quot;skilled&quot; men supplied 14,762 and unskilled 12,310.     Of these, 13,033 and 10,102 respectively are out with farmers.     The balance of unskilled at the Depots has increased during the week owing to the return of men no longer required who were engaged on harvest work, but steps are being taken to train these men and send them out again to farmers requiring assistance for the 1918 programme.Additional men to the number of 86 were supplied for tractor training, bringing the number of such men supplied to date to the total of 1,397.Horses.   Instructions for the issue of 215 horses have been sent out during the week, making a total of 3,634 horses to date.
Fr isoners of War.    One additional Agricultural Prisoner Camp was opened during the week, bringing the total number of camps up to 32, comprising in all 3,221 prisoners.     In addition, 553 prisoners are employed from the parent camps and 1,359 civilian prisoners have been released to undertake agricultural work, making in all 5,133 prisoners now employed in agriculture.     T*-o further schemes for the formation of camps were sent to the War Office during the week and additional prisoners are required at two of the existing camps.     The total number of new camps now under consideration by the War Office is 13, the number of extra prisoners asked for being 1,260.Foment Branch, /s a result of the Efficiency Test held last week at Eaton Parkj Cheshire, a number of requests have been received for ploughwomen.The organisation of village labour is having excellent results.     Reports are received from many districts that an increasing number of local women are working.     One gang in Wales has earned  75 during the season.     The chief difficulty in this area appears to be that the demand and supply often do not occur in the same district.      In the Old Colwyn district, for example, there are many women ready to work, but they are not required as the quarrymen help the farmers in their spare time, whereas In the Talycafn district there is a great demand but no supply.The following statement summarises the latest return ofthe women enrolled in the Women&apos;s Land Army:-In Training Centres............... 273On Farm Work......................5,786Employed by Forage Dept........... 417Employed by Timber Dept........... 156Waiting for references to beplaced in Training Centres.... 28Waiting for employment in Depots .. 41Waiting in their own homes........ 116Total 6,817
B&amp;CEAMICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position as regardsthe provision of tractors purchased or ordered by the Department:-Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees up to and including13th November ... ... ... 1,673Consigning instructions givendur.i-.ng the week     ... ... ... 77On offer to counties ... ... ... 29Consigned to Scotland   106&quot; &quot; Ireland      70     ... ...        _1781^960SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.     At the request of the Ministry of Munitions the importance of the manufacture of Nitre Cake Sulphate of Ammonia has been pressed on the manufacturers who are members of the Distribution Committee.     The shortage of Sulphuric Acid may necessitate the use of Nitre Cake early next year, but there are a number of technical difficulties which have not yet been overcome in the use of this material in the manufacture of Sulphate of Ammonia.   In the meantime it has been suggested to the Ministry that a circular should be issued to makers explaining the process so far as it is at present understood.Superphosphate.   The production of Superphosphate somewhat improved last month and amounted to about 40,000 tons, as against 28,000 tons in the preceding month.   The deliveries are still comparatively slew, and the stocks have increased from about 86,000 tons at the beginning of October to 104,000 tons at the beginning of Novemberj of these 45,700 were located in England and Wales, 9,700 in Scotland, and about 48,700 in Ireland.   The local distribution in England appears to have somewhat improved, and supplies are now available in the Eastern counties.   The Department is pressing the Ministry of Munitions in regard to the distribution, and a press notice is being issued, urging farmers to take immediate delivery. It is of great importance that the stocks at works should be
cleared rapidly, particularly in order to avoid congestion on the railways next spring, and the attention of Approved Agents and Executive Committees is being drawn to the point, potash.   The small cargo of Sulphate of Potash from Malta has now arrived safely.     The quantity already sold to Approved Agents is over 60 tons.The Approved Agents have now been informed of the arrangements made for the sale of flue dust, and a leaflet on the subject will be issued next week.     The quantity of flue dust which will be available is not known exactly, but It is anticipated that the demand will be appreciably in excess of the supply. Owing to the importance of supplying potash to the Irish Flax Crop, it has been arranged that the Issue of licences for the sale of potash should be temporarily suspended with a view to such potash as is available being diverted to Ireland.     It is proposed for the present to retain the raw flue dust for distribution in Great Britain.Stable Manure.   The Director of Supplies paid a visit to Aldershot and concluded an arrangement for the disposal of the manure from the Eelmoor dump by which 1/- per ton will be paid to the War Office for the manure, in addition to the cost of barging it to selected centres on the Basingstoke Canal.     The charge made to farmers will be 4/6 per ton on the Canal bank.      It is hoped that the Surrey Executive Committee will be able to arrange for the removal of a substantial quantity at these rates, but, at a meeting of farmers convened by the Hampshire Committee, the opinion was expressed that 4/6 was an excessive charge,  and that the farmers could not afford to pay more than 3/6.     This attitude on the part of &quot;the farmers in Hampshire is probably due to the very considerable supplies of manure which have already been obtained from different districts round Aldershot.
Seed meat of,the 1917 Crop.   Arrangements have been made to ship 10,136 quarters of seed wheat from English ports for France.   The number of parcels which have been rejected has reduced the quantity available for export to France, but no exact figure as to the total which will ultimately be available can be given at present. Seed Oats.    Preliminary enquiries have been made through the Wheat Commission as to the possibility of securing a portion of the Manx arop of oats for distribution as seed through the Department. Enquiries from a number of Agricultural Executive Committees indicate that the supply of seed is by no means plentiful and definite information is now being obtained as to the position from each of the Supplies Sub-Committees.Seeds (other than Cereals).   The difficulty with regard to the export of peas from America has not yet been finally solved. Pending a solution no licences for the export of peas from this country are being issued.Seed Potatoes. Arrangements have been made for the purchase ofpotatoes in Scotland now that the Seed Potatoes Order has beenissued. Information is also being obtained in Scotland and inIreland as to the quantities and varieties of second early &quot;seed&quot;which are likely to be available.- A large number of theAgricultural Executive Committees seem disposed to purchasesupplies through the Department under the Distribution Scheme.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board o^ Agricultureand Fisheries.
