This Document is the Property of : - s rritpnnic Majesty&apos;?. Government.)rm^l **Mm t0 thf Fork of the Board of Agr p/h f Scotland for week ending 21et November, 1917?iculture for&apos; The weather during the week has generally been favourable for agricultural work, and good progress has been made with ploughing arid wheat sowing.1. Bistrict Agricultural Committees.During the week a representative of the Board met and conferred with the Vest Perthshire District Agricultural Exeoutive Committee at Dunblane.2. Suorlv of Labour for Oatmeal Hills.In view of the abnormally large crop of oats harvested in Scotland this year, the Board are taking steps to secure an adequate supply of skilled labour to enable oatmeal millers to deal with the increased quantities of oats offered to them for milling.   The Board have been in communication on the subject with all the principal millers in Scotland and with the National Service Department.   It is hoped that arrangements will be made for the release of skilled millers from the Army.3. Supply of Soldier Labour for Agricultural Work.The Board havo informed Agricultural Committees that a separate form of application should be completed in respect of eaoh individual soldier applied for by farmers for agricultural work, in order that the Military Authorities may keep exact reoords of all men released for the purpose specified.4. Machinery and Implements &amp;o.(a) Tractors:   For the season 1917-18 all tractors likely to be required have been ordered and practically all have been allocated to Diatriot Agricultural Committees.   These are of six different types and the numbers and kinds are as follows:-Overtime...................... 10Tit&amp;n......................... 90Universal (Saunderson &amp; Mills) 7Vallie Junior................. 5Bur ford-Cleveland............. 2Moline........................ 1Total... 115(b) Ploughs:   Great difficulty has been experienced in getting ploughs forward to be used by tractors.   This is due largely to the unavoidable delay in getting shipping facilities for those whioh hare to be imported and the lack of material and labour necessary for those made in this country.   Up to 20th instant 53 Sellar three-furrow ploughs have been despatched to the different counties, while oneCase&quot;, one Saunderson &amp; Mills1 &quot;Universal&quot; and one &quot;Emerson&quot; have also been allocated.   In order to keep tractors working, 10 Self-Lift two-furrow &quot;Oliver&quot; ploughs hare been ordered but these will be replaced by three-furrow ploughs of the same make whenever the latter arrive in this oountry.(Q) Suoolv of Horses; In many districts either because of the nature or size of fields, horses will have to be provided to under-take tho increased cultivation.   Requests for these have come from Ross, Inverness, Elgin, Aberdeen, Forfar, Perth, Clackmannan, Stir-iing., Dumfries and Kirkcudbright.   Sanction has been given in all cases /
cases for the Committees to purohase suitable animals at an average price not exoeeding  80.    In several counties these animals are already purohaoed and are being employed in ploughing fields not adapted to tractors.(d) Implements and Harness:    Implements and harness have been purchased for the use of the horse teams.   As far as possible harness has been procured locally by the Committees so as to avoid depletion in any one area by placing one large contract,   whenever possible and where it is considered advisable suitable second-hand harnesshas been procured.   Swing ploughs and farm o*rts hare been furnished whenever desired by the Committees.   Committees in most cases have intimated their requirements of tractor-grubbers and cultivators and orders will be placed for these at once in the hope that these implements will be ready in gocd time for the Spring cultivation.(e) Special Committee of Implement Makers:   The Board have had under oonsideration the question of the additional supply of agri-cultural implements which will be required in connection with the increased area of land to be cultivated for the 1918 crop.   As a result of a Conference with the leading makers in the country a Committee has been appointed by those present at the Conference to consider generally the best means whereby the additional suppliec required can be obtained.    It is proposed to invite offers from makers throughout Scotland with a view to distributing the work of production as equally as possible.   The Members of Committee aro:-Mr Duncan Wallace of Messrs John Wallace &amp; Sons, Glasgow, Chairman. n R. H. IT. Sellar of Messrs G. Sellar &amp; Sons, Huntly and Alloa. &quot; T. S. Elder of Meears William Elder &amp; Sons, Berwick-cn-Tweed. &quot; W. Poole of Messrs A. &amp; J. Kain &amp; Company, Edinburgh. &quot; J. A, Hitohell, Secretary of the Scottish Vehicle Builders Association.With a view to securing the supply of a definite number of specified implements, application has been made to the Treasury for sanction to a guarantee to the I Manufacturers against loss of capital inrofct?&apos;? in the manufacture of any portion of this number which may be unfold after the harvest of 1918 and may require tc be carried over for sale in the Spring of 1919.5. Training of Tractor Drivers.The Board hare modified their previous arrangements (See Repori of 5th September) for training tractor drivers.    They have decided to cease operations at the Training School at Dalmeny and utilise the drivers already trained there and now at work with the District Agricultural Committees for the purpose of training new applicants. A bonus of 5/- per week will be given to drivers whose time is partially taken up in training new men; since it is anticipated that they would lose this amount of acreage bonus in respect of the time occupied.6 * ^ernJ^ojiuctLo.aJklt J-W .The Beard have received an application by a newly formed CoiamiUea of emo.loye::s&apos; and workmen&quot; s representatives for recogni-tion as the District Wagers Cornateee fsr-the Lothians and Peebles District and nave given motice in the Pross that they propose to certify this Gc-Jimitiee subject to consideration of any representa-tions which may be made to them within one month.
7 . Testing of Seeds Order. 1917 .This Order has been issued under the authority of the Food Controller after consultation with the three Departments of Agri-culture in the United Kingdom.    It provides among other things that samples of certain kinds of agricultural and horticultural seeds must be tested either at a private or Government Station before the seeds are sold or exposed for sale.   These tests are to be made in order that the seller may furnish to the purohaser before sales are completed certain particulars as to the purity and germinating capacity of the seed.    It is very probable that the majority of seedsmen in Sootland will prefer to send their samples to the Board&apos;s Station and as a matter of fact during the past few weeks since it became known that an Order cf this kind was under consideration several hundreds of samples have been submitted to the Board for testing.   As a result it has been found neoessary to add to the staff at the Seed Testing Station and to provide additional gerrainators and other equipment.    The Order dons not beoome operative until 1st January next but the present influx of samples is accounted for by the faot that seedsmen have already in hand considerable quantities of seed from which sales will be made after that date.Collection of Statistics and Returns relating to Agriculture.1. Annual Agricultural Returns. 4th June 1917.Two tables are appended showing the acreage of oats, potatoes, wheat and barley in each county in 1917 and 1916, with the increase or decrease.    In the case of oats the inoreased acreage is 3000 more than was estimated in April last.    In some counties the increase is less than was then expected, while in others it is much greater.   In the case of potatoes the increased acreage is 7,500 more than was estimated in April;   the estimates in this oase were however only approximate.   The decrease in the area under wheat is   less than half the estimated decrease.   No estimate was made in April of the acreage to be put under barley.2. Annual Estimates of the Produce of Crops.A table is appended showing the estimated total yield and yield per acre of wheat, barley, oats, beans and hay.   The previous estimates of the produce of wheat are confirmed, while the yield of barley has proved lees than was anticipated.   The oat crop is the largest on reoord, exceeding by 450,000 quarters the crop of 1890, which waB previously the beet, and by 920,000 quarters the crop of 1916.   The yield per acre, nearly 42 bushels, is also the highest on reoord.   The total crop of hay of all   kinds, 900,000 tons, shows a deorease of 135,000   tons as compared with last year, but it is generally of better quality.3. Monthly Estimates of Numbers of Live Stock.The tabulation of the returns for 4th November has now been completed, and a table is appended showing the estimated totals for this date as compared with those returned on 4th June and with the estimates for 4th October.Recruiting in Agriculture.1* Military Service Acts 1916.The number of certificates issued to date by the Board in connection with the scheme for vouching agricultural workers is as followa:-Areas /
Areas.Certificates Issued.Aberdeen212 59 744 641 856 17 2 117 483 15CAyr.............Berv/ick-on-T\veedxort George.....Glencorse.......Hamilton........Inverness.......Perth...........Stirling.-......Total34342. fteview of Inceptions Act.  1017.The number of cases brought before the Board up to 16th November was 1426;    certificates of exemption v;ere granted in 1200 cases, and refused in 122 cases.Women&apos;s Work on the Land-As mentioned in a previous report the Board obtained a grant of  10,000 in order to assist in providing additional Women Workers on the land in Scotland.   While the sum included provision for a limited amount of propaganda work in the way of public meetings, lectures, demonstrations etc.  it was also designed to pay the expenses of recruiting 1000 additional women workers under the scheme adjusted between the Board, the National Servioe Department ani the Ministry cf Labour.   A joint Committee consist-ing of 2 representatives from each of these Departments was set up tc advise, on the subject generally, and considerable success has attended their efforts up to the present.After about seven months&apos; work 912 women workers have been placed in situations.   The need for their assistance and the efficiency of their work are shown by the fact that up to the end of October last not more than 33 volunteers had claimed unemploy-rnent allowance and the total sum expended in such allowances was only  45, an amount very considerably below the Estimate.
