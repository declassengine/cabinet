:-/ES/660.SUGARY OF BLOOKADK IN QRi:ATIQN-A&quot;       -16th-^nd Nov. 1917.BLOCKADE POLIOY. This week there have heen several unoxpect-ed developments in blockade policy.   At the beginning of the week matters were in train for transferring the negotia-tions between Norway and the United States to Christiania and for bringing over delegates from Holland end Sweden to dis-ouss a general settlement of tho Dutch and Swedish questions in conference with the American Mission in London.   It had also been arranged thet the Danish negotiations should stand over until a settlement had been reached with Holland and Norway.      All this has now been reversed.     The Danish question is to be settled with the least possible delay, and Mr. Wilson has decided that all negotiations which involve the rationing of supplies from the United States must be conducted at Washington.     The American Mission have loft London for Paris and are not expected to return.   Nevertheless our invitations to the Swedes and the Dutch to send delegates to London have been allowed to stand.       An exchange of views with these delegates may be useful;   and representatives of the European Allies will be able to take part in the confer-enoe.In the new negotiations with the neutrals at Washington the United States authorities will be mainly influenced by their pressing need for tonnage.     They may make large con-cessions to the Danes and the Dutch in order to obtain a speedy settlement of the Shipping question.     The War Trade Board state that the tonnage which the U.S.A. at present oon-trol will be wholly insufficient, even if no further troops are sent to France after January 1st.     Sir G. Spring Rice recommends that a personal appeal be made to the President
before any hasty decisions, adverse to our blockade policy, have been taken at Washington.IA. It is difficult to say on what lines the negotia-tions at Washington with the Scandinavian countries will ultimately run.     The American Mission in conference with the Allied representatives in London discussed and formu-lated draft proposals for a Norwegian agreement which have been forwarded to Washington to Eerve as a basis for negotiations.     A similar draft for a Danish Agreement has al^o been despatched.     She Danish proposals would secure for the Allies 600fOOO tons of Danish shipping, but thoy involve sanctioning the export from Denmark to Germany of  ,500 horses per month, 6,000 head of oattle per week and 2,100 tons of fish per week.   No similar draft has been made for Sweden, but the French Minister at Stockholm has formulated a scheme which is approved by Sir E. Howard and by his United States colleague.   The scheme would secure to the Allies 40^,000 tons of Swedish shipping and at least half the total Swedish exports of iron ore.   To what extent these proposals are likely to bo modified in the course of the negotiations at Washington is quite uncertain.   But there are indications that the Northern neutrals will obtair. easier terms than were anticipated last week.   Captain Cold was informed by the War Trade Board before leaving Trashing ton that the only question likely to hinder a settlement between the United States and Denmark was the export of fats to Germany (52,000 tons) and the President is opposed to presenting anything in the nature of an ultimatum to Norway.The Germans are pressing the Danes extremely hard. Mr. Anderson, who has this week returned from Berlin, etatec that; Germany has demanded that Denmark shall cease all ex-
Illports to tho United -Kingdom and that the Germans have threat-ened to occupy Jutland, on the ground that tho Allies are planning to seize a naval base in Norway.   Meanwhile German exports to Denmark have dwindled for the moment Into insignifI-eance.The Agreement recently concluded between the Dutch and German Governments does not appear to be working smoothly. The Dutch Government have not fulfilled their undertaking to permit the export of horses to Germany, The Germans affect to regard this as a serious breach of faith. The Dutch, on their side, are exasperated by the failure of the Germans to maintain their deliveries of steel.The American Mission in London egreed to a proposal that Dutch shipping in United Kingdom end United States ports should be quietly and gradually requisitioned.     The War Cabinet have approved of this step;   but it is doubtful whether Mr. Wilson will concur.     The United States War Trada Board are prepared to support the suggestion, but have told Sir C Spring Rice that Mr. Wilson vail require strong grounds for the action and clear assurances that the proposal has been considered from every point of view, including Its possible military and naval consequences.There are indications that the Spanish Government may wilfully delay ratifying the Anglo-Spanish Agreement.   All the material points were settled long ago, but the Spaniards are reluctant to surrender the right of restricting or bus-pending their exports of iron ore to the Allies - the only bargaining counter which remains to them,   There also appear to be pro-German influences in the new Spanish Cabinet.   The King has stated that his Government will not sign the Agreement in its present form, and the Spanish Ambassador in London has been summoned to Madrid to discuss the matter.     We are In-
forming the United States Crovernment of these developments. The Spaniards are in need of important supplies from NorthAmerica, and wo must depend upon the United States to apply any pressure that our interests may require.ARGENTINE GRAIN.      President Irigoyen and his Minister for Foreign Affairs have both expressed their readiness to cooperate in working out a scheme for financing the purchase of the Argen tine wheat surplus for account of the French and British Governments.     Tho Argentine Government have not yet consid-ered the matter officially and the details have still to be arranged.:   1 ARK BXOHAHGE.     The mark exchange continues to fluctuate remark-ably on the Scandinavian bourses.     In Copenha en it was 41.5r on Nov. 14th and 45.00 on Nov. 15th.   It fell to 4^.50 on the 19th and rose again to 45.00 on the  .0th.   In Ohristiania the rate has steadily risen during the week from 40,50 on Nov. 14th to 44.50 on Nov^Oth.     In Stockholm it was 36.50 on the 14th;   36.00 on the 16th;   35.50 on the 17th and 38.25 on the 20th.     The Swiss rate shows greater steadi-nose.     It was 6 .50 at the beginning of the week and now stands at 65.75.losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period Nov. 16-22, 1917 inclusive.
