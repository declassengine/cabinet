I,  -oo0MiaST IS SHE PHOPaHTY OP HIS BRITAggIS MAJESTY1S GOTORHMBHI.306WAB CABIMT. THE jAVAL POSIflOH        FUTURE I.AVAL POLICY,It must always be anticipated that the High Sea Fleet may come out.     The pressure of public opinion in Germany, or economic pressure, may force them out, and the,Admiralty view is that the Grand Fleet must be kept, as regards all its units, at sufficient strength to engage the High Sea Fleet, should it come out, with reasonable prospect of obtaining a complete and overwhelming victory.The first consideration, therefore, is that the Grand Fleet shall not&quot; be weakened.   The second point, which is quite clear, is that unless we obtain more destroyers from some source, we must be prepared to face losses averaging, say, 250,000 tons a month, until at least May of next year. Our destroyers which have been doing convoy work are strained beyonr1 the limit both as regards personnel and material (v.&apos;ar Cabinet Paper G.T.2750)*   The evidence is clear that they cannot continue under present conditions without deteriorating, and we must therefore be prepared to see a considerable reduction in the number of escorting destroyers during the Winter.   This inevitably means heavier losses. . The point, therefore, Is whether the Shipping and Food Controllers are of opinion that, with a rate of loss averaging at least  50,000 tons a month, the nation can be adequately supplied with provisions, munitions and other essentials until June.    If this can be done, it is considered that the position will improve after June, 1918, and that the improvement will be-msteady and maintained.It is the opinion of the Admiralty that, we shall be stronger in 1919 than in 1918, from a purely naval point of view apart from any reduction in the efficiency of the2.769.
blockade that may he caused h$ the defection of Russia, Our naval policy during 1918 will include a very strong offensive against enemy submarines, both by the use of mines and surface craft of every description,  and will involve operations in enemy waters which will probably lead to considerable losses, but the losses will be mostly in small craft.   We should be, as we are now, prepared to meet the High Sea Fleet whenever it moves, we should maintain our hold on the enemy1s commerce, and we should adopt a strong aerial offensive against the enemy&apos;s naval bases and shipsin those bases.In order to assist the Mavy and the Shipping Controller there are certain steps which it is considered might be taken.The first is the stop, age of all unnecessary travelling by sea by ourselves and allies.   The second is the stoppage or at any rate substantial reduction,  in the numbers of officers and men of all nationalities who are travelling to and from overseas theatres of war on leave, especially during 1918.    Were this reduction effected, we should save on escorting vessels,  and the vessels thus saved could be utilised in relief of the destroyers engaged in convoy work which are now breaking down from overwork.In order to reduce   the volume of shipping passing during 1918, a system of compulsory rationing of the country is suggested for the consideration of the   Cabinet.   There is one direction in which, considerable relief to our naval forces would be effected, and this has been previously mentioned - viz,, the capture of the Belgian coast-line from the Germans, or it    control by gunfire from land so as to make it untenable at bases for small craft.There is one other point, and it is of supreme iraport-ance to the shipping situation, namely,  the provision of
ADMIRALTY,26th Wovernier, 1917the labour asked for by the Admiralty Controller for work in the Mercantile shipyards. Unless the Admiralty Controller^ requests are complied with, the improvement in the shipping situation foreshadowed after next summer is seriously jeopardised, and it is urged, with great strength, that the man-power for this purpose should he considered as of first priority requirement even ahead of men for fighting and even if it means the reduction in strength of our armies during next years
