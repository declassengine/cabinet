ACTION  TAKEN.Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The. following Orders as to maintenance of food supply have been issued (luring the week : (1) The Horse and Poultry Mixtures Order 1917, dated 17 November, 1917. prescribes the ingredients of horse chaff mixtures, horse corn mixtures, aud poultry mixtures ; it provides that no horse mixture or poultry mixture may be sold otherwise than by weight; it prohibits the sale by or on behalf of a maker of such mixtures at a price exceeding by more than 30s. a ton the actual cost of the ingredients used ; and fixes the maximum price on sales by a person other than the maker at the actual cost to him of the mixture sold phis such permitted addition as is set forth in the Order and ascertained by reference to the weight comprised in the sale.   The Order comes into force on November 22.(2) The Damaged Grain, Seeds, and Pulse (Prices) Order 19.17, dated 17 Novem-ber, 1917, fixes maximum prices as follows:  Imported feed wheat     - 72s. per quarter of 480 lbs.Damaged imported wheat     -      ODamaged imported rye -      -      -   65s. ,,     480   ,,Damaged imported maize     -     -) Damaged   imported and damagedhome grown seeds and pulse     -   65s.       ,, 480   ,,Damaged imported barley - - 55s. ,, ,, 448 ,, Damaged imported oats        -      -   41s.      ,,       ,,     330   .,Where any of the above articles have been mechanically treated the customary and reasonable charge for such treatment may be added to the price; where these articles are mixed the price of the mixture is to be the price of its cheapest component part. In the case of sales by recognised dealers the maximum prices on wholesale sales are increased by 2s. per quarter, and on retail sales by 4s. per quarter for not exceeding 7.V quarters, and 8s. for less than hall a quarter. For the purpose of this Order the term &quot; Damaged &quot; in relation to wheat, rye. bailey, maize, pulse, and seeds means such articles as are classed as damaged in the ordinary course of trade, and &quot; Damaged Oats &quot; means oats so damaged as to be unsuitable for feeding purposes without reconditioning by kiln-drying or other mechanical treatment. The Order comes into force on 17 December, 1917.(3) The Dredge Corn Order, 1917, dated 17 November, 1917, defines as Dredge Corn any mixture of cereals (whether grown together or not) containing more than one cereal as a main constituent. The Order makes it illegal 1o use on or after the 21st of November, 1917, any dredge corn (other than damaged dredge corn) except in the process of manufacturing flour, and fixes maximum prices for sound and damaged dredge corn. The maximum price of sound dredge corn which consists partly of oats is the Same as the maximum price for oats set out in the Grain (Prices) Order, No. 820, and the maximum price of such dredge corn if damaged is 5s. per quarter of 330 lbs. under the sound price. The maximum price of sound dredge, corn which does not consist partly of oats is the same as the maximum price for barley set out in the Grain (Prices) Order, No. 820, and of such dredge corn if damaged is 7s. 9d. per quarter of 448 lbs. under the sound price. Damaged dredge corn for the purpose of the Order means dredge corn which has been so damaged that the flour or meal which could be milled therefrom would not be fit for use in human food. The maximum prices come into force on the 17th November.a   (33)4299-4   Pk 1   7u   11/17   K&amp;S A
2(4) The Bacon, Earn and Lard (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, dated 17 November 1917, fixes the profits of all importers, curers, manu-facturers, primary and secondary wholesalers and retailers of bacon, ham and lard. Wholesale gross profits are lixed at rates varying from 3s. to 7s. a cwt., but the small secondary wholesaler is allowed a gross proiit iip to a maximum of Us. A retailer is allowed to make a gross profit of 3d. per lb. If he divides a side of bacon into cuts he may spread the proiit over the whole side, charging more for the superior and less for the inferior portions provided that an average of 3d. a lb. profit is not exceeded. The maximum retail price of lard is 2d. a lb. over the actual cost to the retailer. Every retailer is required to display in his place of sale a detailed price list of the various cuts and descriptions which he is selling. No charge for credit, delivery, packages, or wrappings is allowed. Food Coutrol Committees will be furnished with specimen schedules of prices of the various subsidiary cuts of a side of bacon similar to the schedules issued in the case of meat. A schedule of prices is attached to the Order. The Order fixes importers&apos;, curers&apos;, and refiners&apos; prices as from Monday, November 19th, wholesalers&apos;&apos; prices from Friday, November 23rd, and retailers&apos; prices from Monday, November 26th. The prices and profits fixed by the Order are provisional and subject to revision, as the result of further experience of actual costs.(5) The Sugar (Brewers&apos; Restriction) Order, 1917, dated 19 November 1917, restricts the kinds of sugar which maybe used in the brewing of beer (other than sugar in stock or in transit) to solid glucose, invert and caramelised products as therein mentioned, or any mixture of glucose and such products. It further restricts the amount of sugar which may be so used to certain specified percentages of the amount used in the year 1915 by the brewers or their predecessors in business. The supply of sugar, unless of the permitted kind, to a brewer for sale is prohibited. The [Sugar (Restriction) Order ceases as from October 1st to apply to brewers for sale in relation to the brewing of beer.(0) The Potatoes Order (Xo. 2), 1917, dated 19 November 1917, after reciting that with a view to encouraging the growth of potatoe.1 in the year 191 7, it was announced on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a minimum price of 0/. per ton free on rail or free on board would be guaranteed to growers for all sound marketable ware potatoes as delivered in lots of four tons or more, provides that where, pursuant to a bond fide contract for sale, a grower has in any month or other prescribed period delivered in lots of four tons or more ware potatoes grown by him he may apply in the prescribed manner for payment to him in respect of each ton so delivered of a sum equal to the amount by which the average selling price of all ware potatoes so delivered by him during such period falls short of the guaranteed price : Provided that potatoes sold at a rale below the base price shall be deemed to have been sold at tin; base price, that is, the rate per ton iixed by the Food Controller from time to time as the; base price for that area.(7) The Cream Order, 1917, dated 20 November 1917, prohibits the use or sale of cream between 8 December 1917 and 30 April 1918, except for the purpose of making butter or for other authorised purposes. The Order does not affect the use or sale before 15 January 1918 of preserved or sterilised cream made before 20 November 1917, or the consumption of fresh cream by children under the age of five years, patients in hospitals and other similar institutions, and invalids or other persons needing cream iii the interests of their health. Cream must not be sold for purposes of such consumption without a statement in the prescribed form verifying the purpose for which the purchase is effected.Control of Supplies and Pricks.Allied Purchases. Lord Bhondda has held further conferences with Dr. Taylor, the representative on special mission of the United States Food Administration.Mr. Hoover has cabled that his endeavours to secure the prohibition of the import of Portuguese figs into the United States, except under licence, and iu other ways
to improve the supply and regulate the prices of food commodities required for the United Kingdom, will be facilitated if favourable action is takeu by the British Government as regards the supply of tin to the United States.Financial difficulties still continue owing to the inability of the Treasury to provide dollar credits for the export of food stulfs from North America. Mr. Owen Smith cables that Sir Hardman Lever has been unable to give him any additional credits whatever for Bacon and Hams, and in consequence the British Mission lias been unable to accept more than a small percentage of the commodities offered for export, with the result that the packers will cease to manufacture ahead for British requirements.Mr. Hoover cables that machinery for dehydration of potatoes, &amp;c, can be manu-factured at once in America, but that orders should be given without delay. He adds that plants can be erected iu the United States to handle all kinds of vegetables and dried meats.Contracts have been closed in the United States for the delivery of large quantities of boneless beef, tinned corn beef, and butter.In consequence of representations from Mr. Hoover, Mr. Owen Smith has been instructed not to buy cattle cake in the United States for the present.Bacon, Hams and I,ard.-The arrivals of bacon from North America have been large, and a fair proportion has been allotted for distribution to the civilian population. The transference of lard to the Oils and Fats Branch is under consideration.Butter and Cheese.-Progress is being made with the scheme for butter distri-bution. Forms of application from retailers will be returned to this Department on the 22nd instant, and those from wholesalers on the 20th instant, stating their requirements, based in the former case on their trade in 1910, in the latter on application received from customers.Negotiations have been concluded for the purchase of the exportable output in New Zealand of butter and cheese during the period September 1st, 1917, to June 30th, 1918; the estimated amount of butter is 15,000 tons, and the price 157s. per cwt. f.o.b.; if any proiit is made on the sale of the butter in this country, the producers will receive half of it. The estimated amount of cheese is 00,000 tons at Kkl. per lb. f.o.b. for first grade, and 9^fZ. f.o.b. for second grade.Through the purchasing of the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive Mission, sent to the United States of America, 500 tons of butter have been purchased for immediate shipment, at 42i cents per lb. f.a.s. in New York, or approximately 225.S. per cwt. landed in this country.Coffee and Cocoa. The prices of these articles have risen considerably, and the question of their control is under consideration.Dried Fruits. The impossibility of making contracts at reasonable prices for the purchase of currants in Greece has been discussed with M. Venizelos, and it is hoped that some satisfactory arrangement will result.Satisfactory offers of In lian and Afghan sultanas have been received, and as the Ministry of Shipping are hopeful of placing freight at our disposal, we are endeavouring to arrange contracts for a certain quantity of sultanas.Figures have now been obtained- from all the leading manufacturers of their requirements of currants and sultanas up to January 31st, 1918, and arrangements are being made to release the quantities required by them.Feeding Stuffs. A small technical Committee, consisting of the expert members cf the Board of Agriculture, the agricultural advisers of the Ministry of Food, and representative feedeis of dairy and other stock, has been set up for the purpose of advising on a scheme for rationing the different kinds of live-stock throughout the country.Meat. Mr. P. B. Proctor has been appointed Assistant Director of Meat Supplies ; Mr. Procter was formerly Secretary to the Colonial Consignment and Distributing Co., Ltd., and to the Australian Chilling and Freezing Co., Ltd., and the Director of the Fitzroy Estates, Ltd.Oils and Fats. A Committee representative of the leather cloth, paint and varnish, linoleum, and printing ink manufacturers has met at the Ministry of Food to discuss the possibility of economy, in the manufacture of these articles, of oils that might be used for food. A total of 05,000 tons of such oils are now so used per annum, and it is hoped to reduce this amount by 30,000 tons, partly by the
Asubstitution of non-edible oils. The manufacturers of paint and varnish, printing ink, and linoleum have been notified that export of these articles must cease in future.Tea. The Indian and Ceylon Associations have now intimated that their Associations accept the offer made by this Ministry for supplies of Indian and Ceylon tea to be bought on the other side until 31 st May next. The conditions of the offer were that the scheme should be ante-dated to include all tea shipped from India or Ceylon on and after 1st November. Government tea should therefore be arriving early in January, though it will not be possible to commence distributing fill the end of January or beginning of February.As regards China tea, the Foreign Office has now waived any objections to its import, and the import Restrictions Department will no doubt also waive any objections, so that it should be possible at an early date to arrange for a limited amount of China tea to be bought on the other side on Government accouni and to be brought over here as Government tea, but the amount so bought will be limited by the amount of tonnage available, which will probably have to be in N.Y.K. boats.Transport and Cold Storage. Progress is being made with the erection and extension of cold storage in London and Manchester.The Director of Transport and Cold Storage has visited Ireland in order to inspect the existing cold storage, transport and ice manufacture. It was found that the manufacture of ice for the preservation of fish is inadequate, ami its increase; is being considered by this Department ; there is also a lack of cold storage, especially for eggs and poultry; the trade in these articles could be worked up by an increase of cold storage space, which it is hoped to arrange at a later date.Arrangements have been made with the Director of Cross-Channel Transport at Dublin, and with his representatives at Water ford, Cork and Belfast, for tin; increase of cbld storage and transport; these arrangements will obviate, the necessity for having direct representation of this Department in Ireland.Food Economy.Lord Rhondda and Sir Arthur Yapp opened the Scottish Food Economy Campaign at Edinburgh on November loth. They met the Food Control Committees of Edinburgh, Leith, and Midlothian at 3 o&apos;cloek, and at 7.30 p.m. a public meeting was held in the (&quot;slier Hall. Although 5,000 people attended the meeting there was still a large niunber (2,000) unable to gain admittance and an overflow meeting was arranged in the Synod Hall. The Lord Provost presided at the Usher Hall, supported by Lord Strathclyde, the Secretary for Scotland, and other influential leaders of political and public affairs. Lord Phondda and Sir Arthur Vapp addressed both meetings and as a result 7,000 applications were received for membership to the National League of Safety.On November Kith, Lord Phondda and Sir Arthur Yapp visited Glasgow and were entertained at lunch by the Glasgow City Business Club at the Trades Hall. A representative gathering of city business men, numbering over 400, gave both speakers a great reception. At 3.30 ]).m., Lord Rhondda met the Glasgow Food Control Committee at the City Chambers. At 7.30 p.m. a. large meeting was addressed at the St. Andrew&apos;s Hall. Representatives from 55 Trade Union Organisa-tions were present together with representatives of the various societies of the city.Lord Rhondda left Scotland on the Friday evening.   Sir Arthur Yapp gave further addresses at Glasgow and Edinburgh on the two following days.Local Authorities.The Food Control Committees (Scotland) Powers Order, 1017, dated 20 November, 1917, confers upon Food Control Committees in Scotland the power of enforcing within their respective areas the Orders of the Food Controller.The arrangements made for entrusting Food Control Committees in England and Wales with the enforcement of Orders are now complete. Lord Rhondda is, however, anxious that the services of the trained officers of local authorities who already have experience in this or similar work should be placed at the disposal of the Food Control Committees as far as possible for their assistance in carrying out these new functions, and that proper arrangements should be made for co-operation with the police and&apos; county council inspectors.   The Local Government Poard and Home Office are lending
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.In the present reports there are certain features particularly worthy of notice  [1) As suggested last week, the imports of tea show substantial, improvement. (2) The returns from bakers and retailers of flour again chronicle a larger consumption.   Due allowance having been made for the replenishment of stock and seasonal change, a further increase amounting to at least 3 per cent, remains as having occurred since the reduction of price. (3) Cereal imports continue to be low.Imports.The aggregate weight of imported foods (including tea and rice) as shown in Table A, was 154,500 tons last week as compared with 157,500 tons the week before, and 145,000 tons the average of the 6 weeks ended November 1.0th.Though the total has changed little from last week, there has been considerable alteration in the parts. ^Ylleat and flour amounted to 30,400 tons, a decrease of 44,000 tons ; barley increased 5,700 tons, maize 1,800 tons, and rice 12,300 tons, while oats fell from 18,100 tons to 1,100. These cereals together fell from 121,500 tons to 80,300 tons. About 143,000 tons weekly for the rest of the harvest year is necessary to maintain the 1916 level of consumption.The import of meat increased 6,800 tons, and of bacon and hams 3,300 tons. Heavy consignments of sugar arrived.   The average for this year so far is 27,800a   4299-4 Utheir assistance to bring the matter to the notice of the local authorities and the police, and secure whatever assistance may be possible from them.Protests against the constitution of Local Food Committees are still being received, but their number is rapidly decreasing. The few cases in which a Food Control Com-mittee has been improperly constituted, or in which the number of food traders exceeds the limit laid down by the Food Controller are being dealt with rapidly, and without serious difficulty. The question of the grouping of Committees is assuming increased importance. The position of the executive officers of Food Control Committees also reauircs consideration. Food Commissioners are now being consulted in regard to these points.Prosecutions.Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order. Prosecutions are pending against a number of brewers for brewing in excess of their permitted quantities. Under the Output of P)eer (Restriction) Act, 1910, the penalty-for excessive brewing was 21. for every barrel brewed in excess; but contraventions of the Food Controllers Order are treated as summary offences against the Defence of the Realm Regulations which suggest the imposition of a specific fine not large enough to act as a deterrent. Further measures are in contemplation for securing enforcement of this Order.Butter, Maximum Prices Order--A number of reported offences have taken place in various parts of the country, the lines varying from LI. to 10/.Food, Conditions of Sale.

tons, as compared with an average of 30,000 tons in the corresponding weeks last year, and 37,300 tons in 1913.4,9.67 tons of tea were received. The average for the 8 weeks ending Novem-her 17th, is 2,G10 tons, only 3 per cent, below estimated requirements ; but the low imports of the summer months have still to be made good.Consumption.Meat. At four principal meat markets the supply of Itome-fed meat in the week ending November 10th, was 1 per cent, above the average for October 1917, but 9 per cent, above the corresponding week last year (Table 13).The supply of fat cattle at 59 markets (Table C) was, in the week ended Novem-ber 14th, G per cent, above the previous week, but 11 per cent, below the average for October. For the third week in succession it was lower than in the corresponding week last year.The supply of fat sheep was the lowest for seven weeks and 8 per cent, below the average for October 1917, but it is still II per cent, above last year.There were 20 per cent, fewer fat pigs than last week, but the number has fluctuated greatly and no conclusions should he based on short periods.Of foreign dead meat (Table 13) the supply was low and little more than half that of the corresponding week last year.Bread. The preliminary summary of returns from bakers and retailers for the four weeks ended November IOth shows an increase of consumption of 3 per cent, over the previous four weeks. The level of consumption was the same as in May 1917. Last year consumption in the four weeks ended November I Ith was 2^, per cent, above that of the previous four weeks, and. the rise this year is therefore very little more than last. The sales in the most recent period this year are 2 per cent, above last year.The sales of bread are a truer index of consumption during the past few mouths than those of Hour, since the purchases of flour were probably curtailed in the period before the reduction of price on September loth and home stocks subsequently replenished. That this is the case is evidenced by the great changes in the quantities of flour sold in the Northern Counties of England, where home baking is prevalent. In the four Food Control Divisions whose headquarters are Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester, and Nottingham the sales of flour were 38 per cent, greater in the period October 14th to November 10th than in the period August 19th to September loth, while in the rest of the United Kingdom the increase was about 22 per cent.The index-numbers for bread and flour separately are : 		Used in	Bread. .

New Zealand butter is quoted at 231s. Qd. per cwt., a rise of 6s. over the previous week, but the price is 30s. (jd. lower than a year ago.   Cheddar cheese has risen 2s.Oilseed cakes show a substantial fall; on November 19th linseed and palm kernel cakes were at a lower price than at any date in the last six months.Stocks.Revised estimates for the recent harvest are now available and the farm stocks were ascertained on November 1st. The harvests of wheat and oats are given as 2 per cent, and 4 per cent, respectively above the former estimates, and barley as

The bean harvest is now estimated as 92,000 instead of 123,000 tons, and the pea harvest at 8 per cent, less than before.The farm stocks of oats proved to be smaller than was estimated and the total stock is now given as 2,984,000 tons on November 1st instead of 3,148,000 tons. It was 2,475,000 tons on November 1st, 1910. The stocks of barley, beans, and peas are also less than previously estimated, though they are still higher than 12 months ago.
