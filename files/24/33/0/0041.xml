SECRET.Nc. 545/25.G.Summary cf Operations, for October, 1917.British Force *On the approach of autumn, I decided that the troops which had been withdrawn from the Struma and Butkova valleys at the beginning of the summer should be moved forward again to the lower ground.    As a preliminary to this movement, and in order that the proposed line when occupied might be consolidated without undue interference from the enemy, it was necessary to clear the village of Homondos Southwest of Seres which was occupied by an enemy garrison of about one battalion. This operation was undertaken by the 81st In.fajn.try Brigade at dawn on the 14th instant and was entirely successful coming as it did as a complete surprise to tho enemy.   Some sharp fighting took place but by 0550 hours the 2nd Cameron Highlanders and 15th (Scottish Horse) Battalion Royal Highlanders were in possession of the village and had taken 155 prisoners and 2 machine guns.   80 dead Bulgars were subsequently buried.     A considerable quantity of correspondence was found at the Battalion Headquarters in the village which has afforded much useful information regarding the enemy system of defences, and thrown some interesting light on the state of his morale.On the night of the 14th/l5th the general movement forward was carried out without interference by the enemy, and the following line occupied as a front line of defence Gudeli Bridge - Ago Man - Hristian Kamila - Jenikoj -Nevoljen - Cucuiuk - Elisan - Cavdarmah and thence by Lozista along the foot of the hills to DoIran Lake.In/
2In the Strunk valley the main line will be along the river.Since the occupation of this lino, patrol actions have been of daily occurrence in the various villages in the Struma valley, in which losses have almost invariably been inflicted on the enemy.On the morning of the 25th October troops of the 82nd Infantry Brigade combined with Corps Cavalry raided the villages of Salman, Kispoki, Ada and Kakaraska south of Seres.     109 prisoners and one machine gun wore taken and 60 enemy dead counted, before our troops withdrew to our advanced lino.Our casualties in these operations were slight.Meanwhile, on the 12th Corps front, successful raids were carried out on October 6th on Akindzali, Karali, and Bulamac northeast of Lake Doiran, on October 9th against 0.3 west of tho Lake, and on October 23rd against the eastern slopes of the Petit Couronne.Both our own and the enemy artillery have boon generally active on this front throughout the month, and several successful destructive shoots have been carried out on located hostile battery positions.A special bombardment of hostile positions between Lake Doiran and the River Vardar was commenced on October 20th and continued for four days in ordor to divert attention from an operation which was contemplated by the French west of Lake Ohrida.On October 18th I received an offer from General Sarrall to take over the left Brigade sector of my front near the River Vardar.     I have accepted the offer, which is so far satisfactory as he proposes to put more heavy artillery in that area than I have boon able to do. November 10th has boon fixed as tho date of taking ovorhy
by the French.It is understood that the French plans for defenceand command of the Vardar sector are as followsGeneral Gercme will command a group to be known asthe ,!Groupev,ent Gerene&quot; consisting of122me D.I.

(58me Chasseurs a/p    )They propose tc make the Liayadag - Kara - Sinanci hillsand Smol hill and Bayaltza ridge irtc &quot;fortified bastions&quot;.Aviation.Our aeroplanes have been active during the month and have carried out many successful bombing raids against enemy camps and dumps on both fronts and on the Bales mountains.   During these raids they have frequently been attacked bv hostile machines but have always been able to hold their own until the 29th instant, on which date a strong formation of enemy scouts attacked them when carrying out a bombing raid on Cestcvo dump west of Lake Doiran,     Sharp fighting ensued and though our machines succeeded in dropping all their bombs on or near the dump, two of them were driven down behind the enemy lines. v;ith the arrival of the new scout machines now being sent, cur fighting power in the air will be effectively increased.Long distance reconnaissances carried out as far up the Struma valley as Jenikoj and to Gradsko on the Vardar river found no unusual enemy concentrations or movements.One of our kite balloons at Orljak was attacked onthe
the 27th instant by a hostile aeroplane and driven down. The balloon was destroyed. Communications.The Bralo-Itea route was opened on October 12th,     A site for a rest camp at Itea has been found and it is hoped that the camp will be in working order during November. On October 22nd owing to the heavy storms, the railway line between Salonika and Bralo was considerably damaged for a distance cf approximately 20 kilometres in the neighbourhood of Ekaterini.     By the 29th the railway had been sufficiently prepared to allow for a train being sent,Owing to the light construction of this railway line similar accidents must be expected during the forthcoming winter. The French naval authorities endeavoured to open a marine route to Arghia Ilarina near Lamia and kindly transported stores for us but this means of communication had to be discontinued owing to the impossibility of getting railway stock for the conveyance of troops and stores from Arghia Marina to Bralo.The difficulties of supplying, the right of our line at Stavros have been considerably accentuated during the month by constant interruption in the sea communications. Civil Labour.Owing to the frequent occurrence of difficulties with regard to civil labour employed by the allies due to misunderstanding among the labourers caused by the proclamations of the Greek authorities, by the interference of local Greek recruiting agents and by the fear of the labourers that they might afterwards be punished for not having served in the Greek army, Ireferred/
referred ths whole subject to the representative of the Greek Government in Macedonia, with the result that a conference was held at Athens, at which both French and British representatives were present in order fully to discuss the question.     A decree has now been published by the Greek Government proclaiming officially that all men of military age in the allied employ, up to the date of the publication of the decree, are not only considered as soldiers but that their service as labourers would count as service in the Army,   By this decree stability of employment and better discipline among the labourers will be ensured, while the future substitution of men of military age by men of non-military age will be facilitated. Health of the Troops.In spite of the fact that in October 1916 the fall of temperature commenced at an earlier dste thou it did during the past month the health of the troops has been better than during the same period of last year.     The admissions to hospitals and casualty clearing stations have been 124.5 per thousand of strength against 138*8 in October 1916 and the deaths .54 against 1.1 per thousand. No proper comparison can be made between the numbers remaining in hospital at the end of October 1917 and those remaining in hospital at the end of October 1916, as during October 1917 only 500 men were evacuated as compared with over 10,000 for October 1916.It is interesting to note, however, that the increased heat this year had its result in the number of admissions for malaria which were 39 per thousand for October 1917 as compared with 55 per thousand for October 1916.     The great decrease in the admission rate for such diseases asdysentery/
dysentery, diarrhoea and enterica is most satisfactory. Other Forces.operations west of Lake Ohrida with a view to clearing the Lin - Kjuks road and to draw the enemy from the direction of Resna.     The advance wa3 made in three columns along the Udunista - Lin road, the Hill 1704 -Radokal ridge, and west of the Slaimbi river respectively. The westernmost column succeeded in occupying Laktes, Debrova and the ridge northwest of the latter place taking a few prisoners, but the remaining two columns encountered strong enemy entrenchments and wire and were unable to make progress.     Bad weather then ensued, and, the Skumbi river being in full flood, General Sarrail decided to postpone the operations, which, however, he &quot;considers fulfilled their purpose as considerable enemy reinforcements were brought from the direction of liesna.from 2 kilometres N. of Udunista - Hill 1704 - Golik with the left flank on the Skumbi river east of Laktes S1 ab i n j a - Li mg a .iJo operations of any importance have been undertaken by other allied forces.On thic 19th instant French troops commencedThe French west of Lake Ohrida now holdline-3d.)
