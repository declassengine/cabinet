(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Mgjestyj Government.)lo21SECRET.Intelligence Bureau, Department of Information. ))   TOKLY   REPORT   6N   HOLLAND   II.*Nov- 20th* 1917 JTht Sand and Gravel Dispute.H.H.Government has plated before the Netherlands Government clear proof that the sand and gravel passing along Dutch waterways from Germany to Belgium are used for military purposes.    Up to the present no progress seems to have been made towards a solution of the difficulty except that the Dutch Government has now stopped the transit - the amount allowed to traverse Netherland territory between Oot. 15 and Nov. 15 (185040 tons) having passed through with the exception of 15.000 tons.So far as the Press is concerned there has been less comment onsides and the possibility of arbitration.yoanwhile the stoppage of the Dutch Commercial cables is Irrita-ting the people of Holland and if not making them pro-German is oertainly not increasing the popularity^ ef the Entente.It is certain that this agreement has produced a profound effect in Holland.    Before the United States threw In their &amp;ot with the M tent a the Dutch felt that they could always rely on Amerioa to counterbalance any action on the part of Japan likely to endanger Dutch interests in the East.    The Japanese-American Treaty has completely upset the calculations of the Netherlands Government and has raised the spectre of the possible loss ot the Indies.this question lately.    Such points adjhave been discussed are chief-rIf the credibility of the respective statements put forward by bothShe recent Japanese-American Treaty.
i22Holland which has long been nervous as to the future of her colonies now feels that her sheet-anchor has gont and that she must trust to her cwn resources or to the problematioal assistance of Great Britain.It appears certain that the Japanese, although they may nourrieh no immediate designs an the Butch Bast Indies, are trying to obtain a hold on trade in those regions.    They are flooding Jfcv* with spies and by enticing Javanese students to Tokio University are making use of the deadliest of all forms of propaganda.There is a good deal of unrest in the Dutch Possessions and this appears to take the farm, not of a desire to oast off all alien domination but of substituting for Dutoh rule that of a stronger P^wer.    That power is probably Japan.The Indies have for generations been the back-bone of Dutch Commercial prosperity and even the remote prospect of their lose fills the well-to-do classes in Holland with apprehension.The U. Boat Menace to Great Britain.Considerable interest has been aroused in Holland by the publi-eation in the &quot;Bieuwe Rptterdamsche Courant&quot; of an article signed &quot;Nautilus&quot; which claims that the German figures regarding the sub-marine campaign &amp;re more accurate than the British.     He states that unless Germany can be economically and militarily defeated before ?eb. l. 1919 no shipping space will be left for the food-supply of Eorjpe and that the Entente will have to give up the fight before the end af next year.    Briefly put Nautilus&quot; assumes that there are 300 German P.Boats and that of these 100 are operating at any given time.    Every U. Boat is assumed to oruise for a month at a time and ti sink 8000 Tons during its voyage.    This results in the yearly destruction of 10 million tone of shipping.    The Germans
give 5 million tons as the amount of shipping sunk in the first six months of the intensive campaign therefore &quot;Nautilus&quot; thinks that their figures are correct.Professor Niermeyer,.who traverses the figures given by Nautilus says that the numberfof the German U - boat fleet is a pure assump-tion.    Even supposing it to be aocurate that in the first sixmonths the Germans sank 5 million tons how can it be argued that innthe subsequent six months like results will be attained.     The weekly totals of ships sunk are deolining and this is admitted by the Germans.    Further &quot;Hautilus&quot; says nothing of the submarines lost although according to the British the number is very considerable.Professor Hiermeyer concludes that the submarine campaign al-theugh serieus is new so far in hand that it will not be the deciding factor in the war.The Italian Campaign,There is no doubt that the disaster which has befallen our Allies has produced a profound Impression in Holland.   Scepticism is expressed as to the possibility of Great Britain and France, begin able t* afford the requisite assistance in time.     The general   : view is that the best way tc help Italy would be a pewerfnl assault on the Western Front.     Even those papers whioh dt net oonsider the Italian defeat as an absolute &quot;debacle&quot; oonsider the prospect if net hopeless exceedingly gloomy.Debate en the Budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.l$r. Leudeun came in for a cco^iderable amount cf praise for his conduct j*f the foreign policy cf the nation since the outbreak of war;   but there was a certain amount of criticism as regards the
attitude of the Netherlands Government toward various questions ef Foreign Polioy.     Certain aambers enquired whether action was taken with the necessary emuhasis for the recognition of Dutoh rights when endangered by one of the belligerent pawstes or by the other and reference was specially made to the diffi-culties in respect of Netherland vessels at present in United States ports and of the food-stuffs purchased in America by the Netherlands Government.     Several members enquired whether during the&quot; negotiations concerning the importation of food-stuffs the Government had sufficiently drawn attention to the fact that during the course of the war the Dutch nation had given hospital-ity to a very large number of aliens belonging to the belligerent parties and had now offered suoh hospitality to thousands of soldiers without being obliged to do so by any international obligation.Some members stated that they would have appreciated a more straightforward action in regard to the Papal peace-proposal.There was considerable adverse criticism of the UetherlandsDiplomatic Service in regard to the laok of activity ef the Headsof Missions at some costs. Of the/ Other mose important mattero discussed wet the principal were the firing by the British upon German vessels in Dutoh territorial waters in Jufcy, the result of the negotiations with Germany as to the Dutch vessels torpedoed off Falmouth in Feb. 1917 and the revision of Prize Courts decisions.Holland and America.The question a  Ibsus between the U.S.A. and Holland has not progressed much further so far as apnears from the press. The U.S.Legation has issued a statement of the polioy of the War
Trade Commission with regard to hunker coal (Oct. 29) as follows&quot;The Commission does not aim at hindering commerce between other neutrals and neutrals adjacent to Germany, hut if vessels desire to uae U.S.A.coal they will not be permitted to do so for the continuation of a voyage, the consequence of which will be that the enemy is provided with or assis-ted in obtaining food-stuffs, fodder, er other goods.     A ship on her way to non-Enropean neutrals which calls at U.S.A. ports for bunker coal will not obtain the neoessary permit unless she Threes to return to the U.S.A. with a carge approved by the Commission or destined for a oountry other than countries adjacent to the enemy.     The Commission will gladly assist neutral ships to oontinue their voyages to S. America er non-European ports, but so long as it has not received the full information required of countries adjacent to the enemy with regard to their resources and needs, the Commission does not feel able to follow any other policy than that described above&quot;.According to the Telograf (Oct. 30) the negotiations withAmerica are proceeding favourably.Dutch War Credit.A supplemantary War Credit for 1917 of 160 million fl&amp;ffine ( 15 million) was submitted to the Second Chamber on Nov. 14.     It Includes 2.770000 florins ( 230.000) for the Air Servioe, 3.800000 ( 316.666)for the Automobile Servioe, and two ixema of 9^- million and 9.323000 florins for the improvement of certain zones for defence. A sum of  2.416.000 is allotted for artillery material.Gorman Attaok on Dutch Fishing Craft.There has been a bad instanco of an unprovoked attaok by a German submarine on a Dutoh trawler.     There was no warning and the Trawler was only 25 miles off the Dutch coast.     One boy was killed but after drifting for seven hours in a boat the rest of the orew was saved.     It is difficult to understand how the Germans them-selves can defend such useless and stupid barbarity which has needless to say aroused strong feeling in Hollamd which is reflected in vehement artioles in suoh papers as the Eandelsblad and Telegraf.
81. 11. 17Dr. A. Kuyper.It is perhaps not without interest that the former Prime Minister and head of the Calvinists recenlij celebrated his 80th birthday.    He is *he Editor of the ultra-Conservative and pro-Gorman newspaper the &quot;Standaard&quot; of Amsterdam.    The German Emperor sent Dr. iTiyper on the occasion an autograph note accom-paniod by a larpj bouquet of flowers.
