(Thi3 Document is the Property of Ei3 B7*;Tfennic Majesty^ Government)-- WAR    CABINET, I 0 4G.T.2732.COiL     ]?0R     ITALY,(Letter from Sir Rannell Rodd to Mr. Balfour, dated Hovemhor 13th, 1917).BRITISH EMBASSY,Ho. 825 Commercial. R0ME*Secret. November 13th, 1917.Sir,With referenco to my telegram 928 of November 13, I have the honour to report that the Minister of Transports has to-day sent a short memorandum on the dearth of coal in Italy, accompanied by a personal letter.Between July and October, he says, an average of 508,000 tons of coal arrived each month in Italy, made up of385,000 tons from England by sea. 79,000   &quot;       &quot;    England via Blaye. 44,000   &quot;       &quot;    America.This quantity, he says, if it could still be maintained would be less than the lowest requirements possible for the country during the winter months which he puts at 510,000 tons per month and computes as follows200,000 tons State Railways,25,000 tons State Offices, Workshops, Steamers, Private Railways and steamers belonging to private Companies.75,000 tons gas1 in the large towns in which it is not possible to reduce the Service to a lower point; also for the malting of benzol and toluol.20,000 tons for indispensable industries (flour mills,land draining plants, paper manufacturies,lime works, central electric stations, heating of hospitals, etc.160,000 tons for arms and ammunition factories.30,000 tons for the Royal Navy (viz. the half their monthly consumption).,Given, however, the absolute necessity with which the Minister has been faced (as explained in my telegram No.928 of November 13th and in my previous telegram No. 853 of October 22nd) of diverting a certain number of ships from the coal and metal carrying trade for the purpose of saving the country from a grain faminer it seems a certainty that the supplies of coal to Italy must fall during the winter very far short of the half million tons which were sent to her monthly in the
summer and autumn.    The Minister in fact calculates an average of 300,000 tons per month for November and December and since the depleted reserves of the State Railways and Royal Havy render them impotent to help the situation, there will, xii the winis of the Minister &quot;be no remedy except that of cutting off the gas from the large towns and closing down almost all the ammunition works&quot;.I have the honour to be with the highest respect,Sir,Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R3MIBLL RODD.The Right Hon.A. J. Balfour, CM., M.?., etc. etc
