THE following letter has been addressed by the French Ministre de 1&apos;Armeinent to the Ministre de 1&apos;Agriculture et du Uavitaillement after a conversation with me, in which it was suggested that M. Loucheur should take steps (1) to secure the allocation to the transport of steel promised by us to France of 250,000 of the 2,000,000 tons recently allotted to the transport of food for France and Italy; and (2) to promote drastic measures of food economy in France.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 23, 1917.My dear Colleague,In continuation of the interview which 1 had yesterday with you and M. Clementel, and in view of our coming meeting on Thursday, the 22nd November, I should like to call your attention to the following points :--The joint programme drawn up by M. Clementel in London with the English Government places the supply of food to the three Allied countries, England, France, and Italy, in the first rank of urgency, and merely lays^own the principle of co-operation as regards transport, especially in connection with the manufacture of munitions.The tonnage which must be reserved by England and France in order to secure the priority for food supplies should, from my point of view, have been allocated entirely from shipments on private account.As I said yesterday, and as Mr. Churchill also pointed out, this tonnage is going to be obtained in England, partly at any rate, by reduced transport of steel and nitrates.These two questions dominate the war, and they cannot be examined independently of the problems of food supply ; for even if it is true that we must eat before we can light, it is of no use to eat if we are to die crushed by the forces of the enemy.Therefore, though I must recognise the prior claim of food supplies, it is impossible to do so in the case of quantities so large as those which have been contemplated hitherto.Priority should be granted only to an indispensable minimum of food indispensable for life, which, as you know, should, in my opinion, correspond to 200 grammes of bread for the middle classes. For months past I have vainly asked the various Ministres du Ravitaillement to put this restriction into force, and I have been determined, ever since the Jast days of the preceding Cabinet, to obtain this request or to resign. I now ask you to impose this restriction at once, with the corollary of a corresponding reduction of the demand for tonnage made on England. In the same way, with regard to sugar and other articles of food, only an indispensable minimum must be granted priority, and drastic reductions should be made immediately, and alter this minimum, tonnage must first be allocated to steel and nitrates ; by the latter I mean those needed both for explosives and for agricultural purposes.I would ask you to consider from this point of view the figures which you intend to put before us on Thursday, and to do so keeping in mind the fact that next spring, if Russia no longer engages the Prussian divisions, we shall have to face the whole German army.Consequently, as the Commander-in-Chief has formally stated, we must be able to supply our armies with guns, munitions, and aircraft, and to do that we must have steel, copper, and explosives.   Therefore we must have ships.Just as I have always borne in mind as far as possible the claims of food supply, I must beg you not to lose sight of these considerations, which are essential to the progress of the war.You will agree with me that there must be no watertight compartments, and I consider that it is our duty, in all loyalty, without considering overmuch the obstacles which we may meet in our path, to examine together the common problem of tonnage.
