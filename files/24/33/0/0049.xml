(This Documej2l]iil2lfl2Ps^:;-^2, Ojoaen Ajrme* a Gerte BuiJ^iin^a^ 5th November, 1917.Dear Lord Derby,While thoroughly agreeing with the objects of the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Bill, I am advised that the drafting of Clause 1 requires reconsideration, as there is a danger at present that persons may co to the courts to concrcl the proceedings of the Commission by way of certiorarv or even compel the Commission to state cases for the opinion of the High Court on points of law under S.24 of the Arbitration Act 1889,. It is suggested to me that the last words of Clause 1, from &quot;and in&quot; assessing in L 19 to the end, should be omitted, and that these words should be substituted; &quot;and the decision of such tribunal shall be final and conclusive and not subject to leyiew in any Court&quot;.     I hope this point will be carefully considered before the bill is introduced as the danger appears to me a serious one.     I understand that attention has already been drawn to this point, or part of it, by Mr. Duke.Yours sincerely, -(Sgd.)   Christopher Addison.Hon the Earl of Derby, K.G., G.C.V.O.,- C.B., War Office,WHITEHALL, S.W.I.
Gen.lTo .16/3777.War Cabinet.Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Bill. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.With referenoe to War Cabinet 253 (5) the Memoranda prepared for the War Cabinet by the Chief&apos;;. Secretary and&quot;the Law Officers respectively (G.T.2195 and G.165) and also a letter dated 5th November 1917 from the ilinister of Reconstruction to me (of which a copy ia attached) have been considered,With regard to the points raised therein it is considered:-(l)   that the Bill ought to give Statutory recognition to the principle on which the Losses Commission have hitherto acted, and ought to refer in express terms to that principle, as, otherwise), there will nothing to guide the Tribunal as to the basis on which compensation is to be assessed.(2)   that any appeal or reference to the ordinary Court3 of Law should be excluded.(3)   that a tine limit should be fixed, either by the present Bill or by some more general legislation at the end of the war, within which all Claims for compensation under the Bill should be put forward.It is suggested, therefore, that the first clause of the Bill Bhould stand as drawn but that the following clause which ha3 been prepared by Parliamentary Counsel should be added:-&quot;Ho report, award, determination, order or other instrument made by or proceeding from the Commission shall be removable by any writ or process into any of His Majesty!s courts, and the proceesings and acts of the Commission shall not be liable to be interfered with or questioned by, or in any oourt or elsewhere by &quot;-ay of mandamus, prohibition, injunction, interdict or otherwise.&quot;This clause 7/ould appear to protect the Government against the risk of interference by the Courts of La*v with the awardu of the Losses Commission and, consequently, to remove the chief objections raised in the memoranda and letter now under consideration, but the- opinion of the Law Officers on this point ^ill no doubt be obtained.No clause providing for a statutory period of Limitation has been drafted as it is considered that the more convenient course would be that a general Statute of Limitations in respect of claims arising out cf the war should be passed after the termination of the war.Certain/
Certain amendments on points ef detail will be desirable but these can be settled when the principle of the Bill and its general form have been approved.DERBY.23rd SToveaiber. 1917.
