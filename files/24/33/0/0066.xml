Ooloai fesmIN ational Insurance (Part II.) (Amendment) Bill.MEMORANDUM.The National Insurance (Part II.) (Munition Workers) Act, 1916, which came into force on 4th September 1916, temporarily extends the scheme of compulsory insurance against unemploy-ment, contained in Part II. of the National Insurance Act, 1911, to munition workers and to certain trades specified in the First Schedule.&apos;5 Under this extension contributions from employers and workpeople will be payable for such period as the Minister of Labour may determine, not being longer than five years from 4th September 1916, or three years after the end of the war, whichever is the longer.Representations have been made with the object of excluding certain trades from the operation of the Act of 1916, mainly on the ground that in these trades some provision against unem-ployment is already made, and (the amount of unemployment after the, war will, it is contended, not be so great as to justify the rates of contributions payable under the Act. The Minister of Labour has no power, under the Act, to exclude from unem-ployment insurance any of the trades specified in the schedule.^ and clause 1 of the present Bill gives him the necessary powers.Under the National Insurance Act, 1911, the amount of benefit that may be paid is limited to one week for every five contributions. The proportion of benefit to contributions under this rule coulcL probably be decreased by administrative order, but there appears to be no such power to increase it, so as to give a larger amount of benefit in respect of a given number of contributions. Clause 2 therefore proposes to empower the Minister of Labour to vary &quot;the proportion.* The powers of the Board of Trade under the Acts relating to imemploy-ment insurance have been transferred to the Minister of Labour under the New Ministries and Secretaries, Act, 1916.6.1-4 a
