S &apos;    SHORTAGE OF BREAL5TUFFS,TTTTT^^^MOHAKDM BY THE FOOD CONTROLLER . 193!^ITj^Z^lir^3*P&apos;*1^ ......... .......-.......I desire to bring to the earnest attention of the Far Cabinet the extremely grave situation disclosed in the attached memorandum on the bread-stuff needs of the Allies which has been submitted   to me by the Wheat Executive.The memorandum shows that on Mr. Hoover&apos;s present est-imate the Wheat Supply of the world will fall short of the total requirements of the Allies by about 3,000,000 tons and that when all cereals available for bread are included, there will still be a shortage of over 2,000,000 tons  (or approximately 10$) to be made good by special measures.I concur in the measures proposed by the Wheat Executive and desire to urge upon the War Cabinet the absolute necessity of taking immediate steps to ensure:-(I) That the American Food Administration should arrange for the export of not less than 1,100,000 tons of bread-stuff grain from North America in each of  the three months December to February.(II) That the entire exportable surplus of the Argentine wheat crop together with Ig million tons of maize should be secured for the European Allies and that the necessary financial arrangements should be made at once to enable this to be done,(111) That the American Government should be pressed, as a natter of the first urgency, to arrange for the drying of enough maize-to make good any shortage in wheat shipments.Above all I desire to draw attention to the supreme importance of making every affort to increase the home production of food, and of making this increase a first charge upon the nation&apos;s resources in men, money, material and machinery.RHONDDA.Ministry of Food,22nd November, 1917.
l6th November, 1917.STA!!Wn^T BY THE WHEAT EXECUTIVE.As a result of discussions with Dr. Alonzo Taylor, the Wheat Executive realise that the estimates; on which they have hitherto based their programme, must be radically revised.Dr. Alonzo Taylor confirms the estimate contained in the telegram received from Mr. Hoover on the 10th November, that the exportable surplus of Wheat from the U.S-A. and Canada oombined will not exceed 3*620,000 tons, and Dr. Taylor also concurs in the view held by the Wheat Executive that this small total indicates that the U-S.A.imports of wheat from Canada will equal, or exceed, the TJ.S.A. exports of wheat.The programme on which the Wheat Executive have hitherto based their operations, which involves the shipments set out in Table 1, was made out on the assumption based on official estimates that the Burplus of Canada for export to Europe will amount to 4,000,000 tons, and of U.S.A. to 3*000,000 tons.   On this basis, after assuming that India will provide 2,000,000 tons, which the Government of India regard as the maximum export, and that 2f million tons will be obtainable from the Argentine, it appeared that 30j  of the total bread-stuff needs of the Allies, for whom the Wheat Executive make purchases, could be supplied by wheat, but on the revised figures, wheat will not be available in sufficient quantity to provide more than about 67%&apos;of this.total.The needs of the Allies are set out in detail in Table No.II, and are regarded by the Executive as the absolutely indispensable minimum.    It is true the figures are large, and the total is larger than in previous years, but, unfortunately, the harvests of France and Italy show an enormous reduction on previous years. A comparison of the position, after taking these importations into account with the total available in previous years, shows that the requirements arc on a reasonable level:-THOUSANDS OFMETRIC TONS:UNITED_KINGS OHWheat Crop    Import for bread Total1917-1916    1.219 *              6.088 7-3071916-1917    1.412                 6.233 7-845Average 1909-1913    1-623                5-880 7-503*   In addition one half barley crop (571,500 metric tons) is allocated to bread-making.FRANCEWheat Crop     Import for bread Total1917-1918    3-100               3-4-20 6.5201916-1917     5-041                 2.081 7-122Average 1909-1913     8.645                  1.188 9.833

It must be borne in mind that by increasing the proportion of cereals other than Wheat, an overhead increase is caused in the quantity of grain to &quot;be shipped, and the volume of tonnage required, Bince these grains , when milled, yield a lower percentage of flour.If the deficiency of wheat is to be made good, the total requirement of United Kingdom, France and Italy of maize, barley, and rye are raised to no less than 12,242,400 tons, and the attached Table No.iii shows that the total of these cereals available amounts to 9.763.000 tons or 2.479.400 tons less than the total requirements.   The only other large volume of cereals, suitable, for admixture in the loaf, in the world is Burmese rice, which cannot he relied on in quantity owing to the long voyage.The position disclosed is, therefore, an extremely serious one, both from the point of view of wheat alone, and of all cereals combined.   As far as wheat is concerned, on the revised basis, the quantity available for the consumption per head of the population of each of the three countries is worked out on Table Ho.IV attached.   The following is a summary of the result:-As far as cereals generally are concerned, it is difficult to find the source from which relief can be obtained, since oats are not suitable for admixture in the loaf in quantity.   The U.8.A. have an enormous quantity of Maize, but the quantity obtainable sufficiently dry to stand the Atlantic Voyage up to the month of March is strictly limited.   After the most careful and repeated enquiries from America, the quantity cannot be placed higher than the figures set out in Table No.I.   Shipments in a natural condition for a considerable period after that month are not likely to arrive in a condition fit for human consumption, though dried maize can be shipped.Bushel8 per head per annum.Average 1909/1913 United Kingdom   6.0 Prance 8.2Italy 6.2Cereal Year 1917/1918. 4.3   .4.24.1
Since thi3 is the only Grain available, it would appear essential, if sufficient food is to be forthcoming, that a new and comprehensive organisation for drying Maize should be set on foot at once in the TJ.S.A.The possibility of securing the Argentine crop also causes grave anxiety.   The Wheat Executive are aware that negociations are proceeding between the various Governments as to the provision of Finance in that country, but the position is that, at the present time, the Executive have instructions from the Treasury to make no purchases.   They cannot emphasise too strongly that even on the original estimates the entire Argentine wheat crop is necessary.   If the revised estimates are realised, privation for the European Allies is a certainty, even if ail the Argentine Grain available for export is secured, and any delay in shipment will gravely accentuate the position.The Wheat Executive desire further to call the attention of their Governments to the fact that they have been officially informed that the Argentine Government have granted Licenses to the Spanish and Dutch Governments to export 300,000 and 500,000 tons of Wheat respectively from the Argentine.    It would be a disaster if the amount of Wheat available for export from the Argentine by the Wheat Executive is reduced by 800,000 tons of Wheat for early shipment.The Wheat Executive consider it their duty to bring this grave condition of affairs to the attention of the Governments they represent, and they request the Governments concerned to secure:-(l)   That the American Focd Administration should make alloca-tionSi or other arrangements, in order that exports of bread-stuffs grain from Horth America should not fall below 1,100,000 tons during each of the months of December, January and February *(2)   That, in one way or another, it should be made certain, before the end of the present month, that the entire exportable surplus of the Argentine Wheat crop is secured for the European Allies, and not less than 1,500, 000 tons of Maize(3)   That the full power of the American Government should be applied to make arrangements for drying maize in sufficient quantities to make good, as far as possible,  any deficiency in Wheat shipments.The following figures, representing the percentage by which the arrivals of breadstuff cereals in each country by the end of December next will fall short of the minimum importation
requirements of that country, discloses vividly the *:ee&amp; for immediate action:-TJ.K. 20.8^ France l8.5/  Italy      22.2%In consequence of this deficiency, distribution is alres becoming an anxious problem, though substantial r-tc .:   c. from the last harvest are still held by farmers.J.
