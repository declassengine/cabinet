Colonel Jones[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]        3 0Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.X\ - &apos; FOOD PRODUCTION.iCj^Hl^^i^^    Board of Agriculture, England and Wales.Memorandum.I DESIRE to call attention to the urgent necessity of deciding the questions raised in the memorandum of the Board of Agriculture and the Food Production Department (copy annexed, marked (A.)).In June 1917, it was proposed to increase the arable area in England and Wales by 2,695,000 acres under corn, potatoes, and roots for the harvest of 1918, and a demand was made for the necessary labour, horses, fertilisers, machinery, motor fuel, and implements. The proposal was adopted as part of the land policy of the Government.Of this area, approximately 2,000,000 acres remain to be ploughed. The large arrears are partly due to the weather, but very largely to the failure to provide the necessary labour, horses, machinery, motor fuel, and implements.It may, with favourable weather, still be possible not only to maintain the existing area in cultivation, but also to add the 2,000,000 acres, provided that the assistance asked for is given. It is the lowest possible estimate. If the Cabinet decides that the assistance cannot be given, the proposal must be at once either abandoned or modified.Prices will greatly influence the increase or decrease in the production of home-grown food. . The second memorandum (B.), is therefore, from this point of view, important.R. E. PROTHERO.November 24. 1917.(A.)-FOOD PRODUCTION PROGRAMME FOR THE 1918 HARVEST.Statement of Present Position, Future Prospects, and Urgent Requirements.*1. The Food Production Department having reviewed the position of the agricultural programme for England and Wales for the 1918 harvest, the following statement of prospects and requirements is submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet.Ploughing Task.2. The original programme, which contemplated the ploughing up of 3,000,000 acres of grass land, was submitted to the Cabinet on the 20th April last, but was revised by the Department on the 14th June, when it became evident that there was no prospect of the requirements necessary to carry it out being forthcoming in time. The situation had also been modified by the fact that the Agricultural Departments for Scotland and Ireland considered that it would be possible largely to increase the production in those countries, and thus to lighten the task to be undertaken in England and Wales.* This memorandum deals exclusively with agriculture. A large addition to food supplies is anticipated from the cultivation of allotments and gardens, but as the requirement in this case for !abour and supplies will be very limited, it has not been considered necessary to set them out in detail here. A memorandum showing the steps which it, is proposed to take to increase production by spade cultivation, will be submitted separately.[1201] B
3. The revised programme aimed at increasing the area under the plough, as compared with the 1916 area, by (a) the breaking up of 2,050,000 acres of permanent pasture, and (b) the ploughing of 645,000 acres of temporary grass in addition to the area of. temporary grass which would have been ploughed in the normal way, making a total of 2,695,000 acres to be added to the area already under crops in 1916.4. The annual official &quot;Agricultural Returns &quot; show that, up to the 4th June last, the area of ploughed land had been increased by 278,000 acres over the 1916 area, thus leaving about 2,400,000 acres of grass land (permanent - and additional temporary), to be ploughed for the 1918 harvest. Of this area it is estimated that not less than 300,000 acres have been, ploughed by all agencies since the 4th June up to the present date, leaving a balance of approximately 2,000,000 acres which would have to be ploughed before the third week in April if the revised programme was to be carried out in its entirety.5. In view of the prolonged delays which have occurred in supplying labour and other requisites, and owing to the disastrous weather conditions of the last few months, it would be useless to contemplate any expansion of the revised programme, and indeed it will require an unprecedented effort to realise even the greater portion of it, and at the same time to cultivate the area already under &quot;the plough. On the other hand, given good normal weather for the next twenty weeks, and provided that the other requirements set out in the subsequent paragraphs of this memoran-dum are forthcoming as required, the cultivation of the existing arable area and the ploughing of 2,000,000 acres between now and the end of the ploughing season do not constitute so impossible a task as it might seem at first sight to be. Success, however, could only be achieved if adequate supplies of men, horses, and tractor fuel are promptly provided, sufficient not merely to make up the original require-ments, but supplemented so as to enable work to be overtaken which should have been done during the last six months, and which has not been done owing to the lack of these necessary means.6. A preliminary estimate has been formed of the maximum amount of grass ploughing which could be undertaken between now and the third week in April, and it is considered that under the most favourable circumstances 1,000,000 acres of grass might be broken up in that time by the fullest possible use of Government tractors, Government teams of horses, and sets of steam tackle in the hands of private owners. The latter would have to be kept in commission throughout the winter instead of being laid up in the ordinary way. It is further estimated that, if the weather proves propitious and every stimulus and encouragement are given to farmers, they might be able, with their own resources supplemented by labour lent to them by the Department, to bring into cultivation nearly another million acres. It cannot, however, be too strongly emphasised that this great addition to the area could only be accomplished if the weather and other conditions are in all respects favourable, and if not merely the goodwill but the enthusiastic co-operation of landowners, farmers, and labourers in the policy of the Government can be counted upon from start to finish.Tractor TroMsport and Fuel.7. In view of the prolonged delavs which have occurred in the delivery of tractors and other machinery ordered by the Department last spring, it is essential that immediate steps should be taken by the Shipping Controller and the Ministry of Munitions to speed up transit from America. Also that adequate supplies of fuel, spare parts, &amp;c, should be provided and reserved for all agricultural machinery, whether privately owned or in the hands of the Department.8. In the campaign to increase food production the essence of the problem is time. At present it appears to be impossible to reckon upon less than seven weeks&apos; interval between the date when motor tractors and ploughs are placed on rail by the manufacturers in America and their delivery to Agricultural Committees in this country. Seven weeks is one-third of the time between now and the end of the ploughing season, and drastic efforts should be made to shorten this excessive &quot; lag.&apos;&apos; In particular, special shipping facilities will be necessary to bring the Ford tractors and ploughs across from New York, and special railway facilities are required to ensure their prompt distribution to the counties after they have been erected at Manchester.9. Provided the necessary speeding-up in delivery can be effected, it is esti-mated that the number of Government-owned tractors available for work on the land
in England and Wales for the present time to the end of the ploughing season should bj not lesc than the following : To-day.;&apos;...:      , y.&apos; ( ... . . /. ... .... 1,550End of November... ... ... ... ... 1,750,,  ,, December... ... ... ... ... 2.000January  ... ... ... ... ... 2,500., February... . ... ... ... ^ ... 4,500March &quot; ... ... ... ... ... 6,000.10. For those Government tractors, it will be necessary to provide paraffin and petrol in the following quantities: 	Paraffin.	Petrol. *	Gallons.	Gallons.November	420,000	50,000December	480,000	55,000January February	600,000	70,000	850,000	90,000March	...    1,500,000	150,000April	...    1,500,000	150,00011. Contracts were placed by the Department several months ago to cover all the paraffin and petrol set out in the above statement. In the case of both paraffin and petrol, however, it will be necessary to allow the Department in March and April 1918 to draw quantities in excess of the amounts for which provision lias been made far those months, it having been found that the original estimate of requirements per tractor, was somewhat too low It must be pointed out, however, that the excess required for the months of March and April will be more than covered by under-consumption in the previous months. Moreover, the quantity of paratfin actually drawn by the Department up to the 1st November was 1,865,000 gallons less than the amount for which contracts had been placed and accepted for that period. The original total estimate should, therefore, not be exceeded.12. One of the most difficult and important matters, from the point of view of increasing food production, is the maintenance of tractors and other machinery in private hands, and the provision for them of fuel and spare parts. It is estimated that at the present time there are some 3,500 privately owned tractors in England and Wales, many of which are reported to be standing idle owing to the inability of farmers to obtain fuel. The Food Production Department is not charged with the responsibility of providing fuel for privately owned tractors, but it is obvious that an adequate provision of fuel for these tractors is essential if farmers are to undertake the task assigned to them.13. It will be impossible for farmers to accomplish their part of the ploughing task unless arrangements are made by the Petroleum Executive Committee, whereby privately owned machinery, which is vouched for by Agricultural Executive Com-mittees is assured of sufficient supplies.14. This question of tractor fuel is vital, and has reached a most critical stage. Mr. Long has warned the Department that the supplies for which contracts were arranged through the Pool Board several months ago, may not be forthcoming, or may have to be diverted to more urgent uses. He has further indicated that there can be no appeal against his decisions in this connection. If this be the position, it is necessary to point out the extent to which the fate of the food production programme is involved. Without adequate supplies the tractors cannot work. On the other hand, unless the tractors can be kept going, the programme must largely fail. In this situation it is for the Cabinet to decide whether its food production policy is to stand or fall, and it is submitted that the following are the only alternative courses: (a.) To abandon the ploughing programme, or so much of it as was to be done by tractors.(&amp;.) To put Food Production upon an equal footing with other war services (Navy, Army, Air, and Munitions), and to give its requirements, all round, priority over civil and industrial services.* The quantities of petrol shown in this statement include petrol for the use of the Departments cars provided in connection with the Tractor Scheme.
(c.) The Cabinet to use all its powers with the Departments concerned to get more oil imported, and to ensure that, when it arrives, the requisite amount is earmarked for food production. -Whichever course is adopted, it seems vital to act quickly, and it is suggested that (b) should be put in force at once, and (c) ordered immediately. On the other hand, if (a) is to be the solution, the decision must come from, and be promulgated by, the Cabinet. Otherwise the Board of Agriculture will be made the scapegoat, and will become the laughing stock of the Countjr Committees and the whole farming community.15. It will also be necessary for the Ministry of Munitions co arrange that more material and labour is supplied to manufacturers of agricultural machinery in this country.Horses.16. The limiting factor at present in the provision of horses to be operated by the Department for the 1918 programme (apart from the shortage of skilled plough-men), is the supply of harness, especially collars. There will be ready for issue by the end of November, 9,000 sets. After that date. 500 additional sets per week will be available up to the end of February, making in all, 15,000 sets. Every effort has been made to increase the manufacturing facilities, but so far, without success owing to the lack of skilled labour.17. With regard to the supply of horses, it is understood that the Army authorities are prepared to provide at once 4,000 heavy horses. Under the powers already possessed by the Department there should be no difficulty in acquiring a further 5,000 horses by the end of November, and, subsequently, 500 a week to keep pace with the output of harness. By requisitioning any surplus of farm harness there may be in England and Wales, it might be possible to acquire and equip a further 2,000 horses, making a total of 17,000 in addition to the 3,000 already at work.18. Arrangements will have to be made to obtain from the Army Forage Stores supplies of oats, maize, hay, and straw, for the horses being worked by the Depart-ment. These horses may have to be sent in gangs to districts where no surplus fodder is available, and the Agricultural Executive Committees must have power to indent on the Army Service Corps for supplies.Labour.19. On the 27th June last the War Cabinet decided that, in addition to the 22,000 soldiers supplied for agricultural work last spring who still remain on the land, 43,000 men (i.e., 21,500 skilled and 21,500 unskilled) should be supplied from the Army during July and August for the purposes of the 1918 programme in England and Wales.   The numbers actually received up to the present date are: -(a.) Skilled men        ... ... ... ... 2.500(b.) So-called &quot;skilled&quot; men ... ... ... 10,500(c.) Unskilled men    ... ... ... ... 13,000Total   ... 26,000From this it will be seen that only 50 per cent, of the men promised have been supplied to date, and of these less than 10 per cent, are really skilled.20. For the horses to be purchased and equipped by the Department up to the end of February, the additional number of skilled ploughmen required will be 8,500. Of these 4,500 could be employed between now and the end of November, and are therefore needed at once. The provision of skilled ploughmen is by far the most urgent need of the moment.21. Owing to the small number of skilled ploughmen supplied by the military authorities the Department has been obliged to set up training, schools to teach ploughing, in order to some extent to meet the deficiency. This is an unsatisfactory makeshift, and if the task assigned to the Department&apos;s horses is to be carried out it is essential that no time should be lost in supplying skilled ploughmen.22. It is further estimated that to staff the additional Government tractors which should be at work on the land before the end of March, 9,000 additional drivers
and tractor ploughmen (of whom a certain proportion can be women) will be required, and these will have to be trained as rapidly as possible.23. To carry on the cultivation of the additional land broken up and to assist farmers in cleaning their existing arable it will be necessary to provide unskilled labour (men and women) to the number of at least 31,000. This will not bring the total requirement over the figure originally asked for. Of these not more than 10,000 are likely to be required before the beginning of February.24. The following is a summary of the labour requirements set out in the above paragraphs: Skilled ploughmen       ...      8,500 j4&apos;500 imm^iately and the rest as soonr   &amp; - l   as possible.Tractor     drivers     and &quot;) m,    ,        c 01 -tipploughmen   ......      9,000 [ Th  ,bulk of these not required before31 000 I    February.Unskilled farm labour Total48,500   Of whom a proportion can be women.It must be remembered that of the above, 17,000 still remain to be supplied under the Cabinet decision of the 27th June last.Supply of Skilled Tradesmen.25. It will also be essential to provide or recall from the Army a small number of men possessing technical knowledge and skill if the programme is to be carried through. Under this heading is included such skilled tradesmen as blacksmiths, wheelwrights, mechanics, seedsmen, lime-burners, &amp;c.Arrangements respecting special Crops.26. It is esential that farmers shall receive at the earliest possible date an assurance from the Food Controller that reasonable prices will be obtainable next year. This is specially important in the case of the potato crop. From the point of view of insurance against scarcity, one acre of potatoes is equal to 2 acres of wheat, and at least 3 acres of oats. Moreover, the potato is particularly suitable for planting on grassland of good quality which has just been broken up, and every effort should be made to increase the acreage in 1918. In view of the serious possibility of food shortage in the coming summer, a special effort will have to be made to secure an exceptionally large acreage of second early potatoes. In view of the shortage of seed it will be necessary for the Food Controller to prohibit forthwith the use for human consumption of &quot;British Queen &quot;and certain other second early varieties. In the current year there was no minimum price fixed for second earlies, and as the price of this crop is always uncertain no substantial increase in the. acreage can be expected unless a satisfactory minimum price is fixed now for next year.27. Although the oat crop this year was large much of it is inferior, and there is at present a big demand for oats as fodder. It will, therefore, be necessary for steps to be taken to secure that an adequate supply of seed oats is available, and that sufficient of the Scotch and Manx crops is reserved for seed purposes.28. Provision will also have to be made for a larger stock of seed barley than was the case in 1917. Arrangements should be made to reserve a sufficient propor-tion of the barley in the hands of brewers until after the end of the sowing season. Barley is of special importance, as it is the last grain crop which can be sown.Fertilisers.29. It is not considered possible at this late date to provide for any quantity of fertilisers in addition to those which have already been arranged, or for which sanction has been given by the Cabinet.30. In the case of sulphate of ammonia, the Department has since last Spring estimated on receiving 220,000 tons for agricultural purposes. Apparently, how-ever, the consumption of sulphate of ammonia for munition purposes is expected to be greater than the Ministry previously contemplated, as the Department have recently been informed that only 180,000 tons can be counted upon for agriculture. This deficiency of 40,000 tons will have a very serious effect upon food production, and it is for the Cabinet to decide whether in the present situation the requirements [1201] C
of munition manufacture or of food supply, are to be given preference in this matter. 40,000 tons of sulphate of ammonia properly used on the wheat crop might produce an increased yield equivalent to a year&apos;s bread rations for nearly a million men.31. As regards superphosphate, the Cabinet decided that 50,000 tons per month of phosphate rock should be imported into this country for the five months 1st June to 31st October. Only 149,000 tons have so far been imported, instead of 250,000. Hopes are held out, however, that from now till the end of March the monthly imports may amount to the full 50,000 tons, and it is essential that this estimate shall be realised.Finance.32. A considerable amount of extra capital will be required by farmers if the programme of the Department is to be carried out. At present the sanction of the Treasury to the credit scheme of the Department does not extend beyond the present year, and the scheme only provides for short-term advances, the maximum period being nine months. It will be necessary that the sanction should be renewed, and probably that the scope of the scheme should be extended. Enquiries on this matter are proceeding. It may also be necessary to provide for long-term credit or other financial assistance for landowners in order to assist them to meet capital expendi-ture for such purposes as fencing or buildings which are required owing to the ploughing up of grass land.33. It will also be necessary to strengthen considerably the staff of the Agri-cultural Executive Committees, particularly by the appointment in each district of Deputy Executive Officers, who will see that the orders of the Committees as to ploughing up grass, &amp;c, are actually carried out.34. It also seems desirable that it should be clearly stated at this stage that the great pressure under which it will be necessary to conduct the food production campaign during the next few months will make it impossible for the Department^ tractor scheme, horse scheme, and other operations to be carried out on an entirely self-supporting basis.Compulsory Powers.35. Experience during the present year has shown that the following additions should be made to the powers already conferred on the Board under the Defence of the Realm Regulations : (a.) Power to take possession of any land or buildings the use of which isnecessary to secure the cultivation of any other land. (&amp;.) Power to require the trimming or grubbing of hedges and the topping orfelling of trees, and in default power to carry out the work, (c.) Power to require cultivation and stock returns from occupiers of land. id.) Power to make trespass on cultivated land a summary offence under theDefence of the Realm Act. (e.) Power to require seedsmen to furnish the Department &quot;with information asto their stocks of seed.In view of the shortage of fertilisers, and Especially of the fact that the main object is to increase food supplies, it is essential not only to improve the condition of the existing arable land, but to select for ploughing such land as will produce the maximum amount of food. Compulsory orders to break up good grass land will unquestionably be met, in many cases, with criticism, opposition, and even open obstruction. If the programme is to be carried out, however, it will be essential that it should be recognised as the policy of the War Cabinet, decided upon as a war measure, after considering all the factors in the food situation, and it will need to be actively supported not merely by members of the Government particularly concerned with agriculture but by everyone who can influence the attitude of agriculturists.R. E. PROTHERO. ^ A. LEE.Food Production Department, November 19, 1917.
(B.)PRICES.The food production campaign is intimately bound up with the question ofprice-fixing.Let it be granted that during the second and third years of the war farmers generally made exceptional profits, and that many of them, especially the graziers, are continuing to do so, even with the present limitation of prices. These excessive profits are, however, disappearing as far as concerns the arable farmer, and the more intensively he farms the less is his margin of profit becoming, because of the rapidly rising costs of labour and the inferior output from the substitute labour brought in. Costs of production, always difficult to ascertain for farm produce because of the lack of standardisation of farming methods and conditions, are also becoming of less and less value in assessing the prices to be fixed. The farmer is being compelled to put part of his grass land into crop. In some cases this may be immediately profitable when good grass land can be put under potatoes, but on the majority of farms the first year&apos;s work will leave a considerable adverse balance, which will not always be wiped off in the second year. Weather difficulties have been excessive. The farmer is already behindhand with his normal work, and sees the expenditure on the existing arable increased by the necessity of breaking up further grass land. For these reasons the farmer needs a liberal price for the crops he grows, in order to make up for the money he is likely to lose on the extended programme; a proper profit on the cultivation of a normal acre of wheat, &amp;c, will not recoup him for the unremunerative farming he is also compelled to undertake in the national interest. Moreover, it is essential to secure a willing farmer for the new programme, and to carry out the measures of price-fixing and control that will be necessary with some measure of general approval among the agricultural community. The farmer cannot be replaced as the agency for food production, and can only very imperfectly be put in the position of a controlled firm. It is only stating facts to say that the Meat Prices Order, less perhaps by the actual reduction of price than by the methods followed and the profits allowed to middlemen, has disturbed farmers, and rendered them unwilling to co-operate with the food production policy.What is needed to reassure the farmer next year and to get him to throw his strength unreservedly into production is not so much the offer of guaranteed prices (e.g., for potatoes and corn), as a statement that if maximum prices become necessary they shall not be fixed below certain specified limits. For example, as regards main-crop potatoes, the farmer will risk a low price due to normal market conditions if he can be assured that in case of scarcity the Food Controller will not fix his maximum at less than, sayf 61, a ton.For these reasons it is essential that if the food production campaign is to be pressed to the utmost all questions of price-fixing and control of sales of farm produce shall be considered from the point of view of production, to which end the Department of Agriculture shall be given equal responsibility with the Ministry of Food in. the framing of such orders.One further small point the Board desire to press. In the earlier stages of the war they allowed their junior officers to take service in the Forces and with other offices very freely. In consequence, they find themselves excessively shorthanded now that they are called upon to take up the extended programme of food produc-tion. Substitutes of the right kind cannot be found, because what is lacking is men with experience of the office. They therefore ask that they may be able to recall certain officers from active service, perhaps a dozen in all, men for the lack of whom the conduct of the business of the Board is daily hampered and delayed.R.
