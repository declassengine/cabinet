e(This Document is the Property of ^His Britannic Majesty^ Government)SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C 12-f hEMQRAKDUMonTHE   BALTIC   PROVINCES   AMD   THE   LETTS.The Baltic Provinces are three in number, Esthonia, Livonia and Kurland.     Of these regions the Letts at present inhabit the southern part of Livonia (four districts, or Vidzerne-Midiand), all Kurland (Kurzeme, comprising ten districts), and Latgalia (three districts in the Government of Vitebsk).   To this area, amounting tc some 63,000 square kilometres, may be added a small border in the Governments of Pskov and Kovno.     The Letts thus constitute a unity ethnic, cultural and economic, rather than administrative.   They are also to be found scattered throughout Russia, especially in Petrograd and Moscow and the Governments of Novgorod, Mogilev and Kuban;   likewise along the Prussian Baltic coastland and in the American hemisphere.   They number considerably over two millions, of wh$m three-quarters are Protestant;   the remainder are Roman Catholics and Greek Church in the proportion of three to one.Racially the Letts represent a type intermediate between Slavs and Scandinavians and possibly older than either.     Their language is Indo-European and qiite distinct from Russian, constituting together with Lithuanian and Old Prussian the Baltic family,   of the last practically nothing remains to-day.   Prom Lithuanian and German the Lett is separated by profound differences of temperament, religious and political respectively.
Historical records exist of a peaceful Lettish land inhabited already in the seventh and eighth centuries by a highly civilised people living on small holdings rather than in villages, and engaged in agriculture, cattle-raising and bee-keeping.    Into this territory flowed a stream of German invasion in the 12th century through the channels of commerce, religion, and, when these failed, of military force, which penetrated and overspread the whole country,-   the brave resistance of the Letts proved unavailing. The individual most associated with this oonquest of the Baltic provinces is Bishop Albert who founded and was first Governor of Riga, and who created the Order of the Brotherhood of the Sword in 1204.   He also introduced the beginnings of the feudal system by bestowing land upon his vassals.   Of the Lettish aristocracy many were content to become Germanised, but the majority of those Letts who were not already peasant sank to that level in process of time, and by the 14th century had become the serfs of the feudal lords.    It is important to realise that the absorption by Germany of Old Prussia, whose inhabitants were clostily related to the Letts in blood and language, was the initial part of the same campaign, only it happened that the process of conquest and transformation of social character was much more thorough in this instance owing to geographical propinquity.     In Latvia - as the Letts call their country - there was -no radical reconstitution of the national temperament with consequent assimilation:   the German civilisation has always lain as a sort of thin veneer upon the unmodified Lettish character.This situation remained in force for over three hundred years with various attempts, none of which achieved anything permanent, to change it.     Charles XII of Sweden was, however, defeated at Poltava (1709), and with the acquisition of Livonia and Esthonia by Russia in the following year - Kurland in the meantime being
placed under Russian protection and only definitely united to Russia towards the close of the 18th century - this period of Lettish liberty came to an end.   Veil satisfied at having opened a window for Russia on the Baltic, Peter the Great restored their privileges and estates to the great landowners (German barons) who held them now, however, not in virtue of their personal origin but as concessions from a new overlord.   At the same time, from this date commences that penetration of Russian official and court circles by this foreign nobility which eventually did so much to mould the whole spirit of the Russian bureaucracy and hinder the natural development of the Russian people.The Lettish peasants now found themselves living once again under conditions in which they were mere adscript! glebae, who could be bought and sold or given away at the will of the landlord. It happened, however, that in 1802 Alexander I visisted Livonia, the results of which were seen in the law of 1804 which granted rights of proprietorship to the peasants and regulated the rights of the landlords.   This lav/ was, however, repealed after the Napoleonic wars.   About this time also serfage was abolished (1819) in Livoniax, but in return for- this gift of personal liberty the nobility took complete possession of the land, so that the peasants really passed into their power again, having to take their farms and homes at rents which were determined by the landlords alone. Towards the middle of the 19th century there began a very remarkable awakening of the Lettish national self-consciousness.     The most enlightened Letts pressed for the betterment of their fellows and a series of laws were passed which completely changed the outlook of the Lettish peasant.    In 1863 he was legally empowered to movex   It had been abolished two years earlier in Kurland.
from one government to another;   two years later corporal punishment was completely abolished;   in 1866 a measure of rural communal autonomy was introduced.   To the latter institution henceforth corresponded the Landtag or Assembly of the Nobility.   One result of these changed was that tho Lettish population of the towns rose in Kurland from 17.3$ In 1863 to 40.7$ in 1897:   before the war it had risen to 503.    Thus by actual population as well as by legislation the towns lost their former German complexion, and the creation of a Lettish bourgeoisie naturally followed.   At the same time by their energy and intensive labour the peasants put themselves in a very comfortable position.The tjear 1880 is always remembered as the year of Russification. It worked through the schools and other public institutions. In part it prepared an atmosphere for the development of Socialism amongst the proletariat, who henceforth became opposed to the bourgeoisie and were themselves divided into international extremists and nationalist moderates.    Thus in turn the atmosphere was prepared for the revolution of 1905.The introduction of a certain number of liberal measures in Latvia by the Russian Government, previous to, and in part as the result of, the pressure of events arising out of the Russo-Japanese war, was made the occasion by the Lettish Social Democrats to press for more.    Extremes were quickly reached, often under the instigation of locally unknown agitators.   The inevitable reaction followed, and as the German landlords received permission to be its directing instruments, it lacked nothing in ferocity and cruelty. But it passed, and Lettish life once again assumed a normal aspect except that the belief in social democracy had vanished with its leaders, and the energy of the people expressed itself in economic
rather than political activity. At the same time the conditions of economic life reverted to those of earlier days, when all the advantages were planned in the interests of the   nobility.The commencement of the war saw the Letts standing together with the rest of the peoples of Russia in loyalty to the common ca^se, as expressed through their representatives in the Duma. From the beginning, however, the local German element endeavoured to safeguard their own position by attempts to throw suspicion on the Letts.     The year 1915 saw the evacuation of Kurland, the richest of the Baltic provinces:   the work of destruction was carried out as completely as had been the whole process of up-building in the case of 15,000 farms, and mainly by the same hands. Over 700,000 people left their homes, but arrangements were quickly made at different centres to conserve the best in Lettish national life, particularly at Petrograd and at Moscow.   Tho idea of Lettish battalions was also mooted, but was at first opposed by the German landlords on the suggestion that the Letts were suspect:   in the end their groundless opposition was overcome. The first battalion lei t Riga on August 1st, 1915, and frequent testimony has been paid to their bravery by tho Russian General Staff.On the  .5th April, 1916,the German Chancellor declared in the Reichstag that the peoples of the Baltic Littoral who had been &quot;liberated&quot; by the German arms would never be released to revolutionary Russia.   In a similar sense an article in the Deutsche Politik (1st October, 1916) indicated that the German intention in 1916 was to annex and assimilate Kurland, thus dividing Latvia.   By a process of intensive kultur, by the
introduction of German colonists, by the natural abandonment of the region by all ultro-patriotic Letts it was assumed that the policy would be soon effected.   It is obvious how such a policy in closing again in large measure the outlet for Russia to western waters would lead to the gradual suffocation and so possibly to the progressive dismemberment of that State.   Accordingly the question of &quot;no annexation&quot; is peculiarly vital just in this area, and the interest in small nations with which the war began must be extended to this corner of the Baltic Littoral.     A free Latvia in enjoyment of a oultural and economic autonomy in a free Russia was certainly the desire of the great majority of Letts at any rate up to the Revolution of 1917.It cannot be denied, however, that the disorder and anarchy consequent upen the Russian Revolution produced the same impression on the Letts as on the Finns and other small nationalities, - viz. a desire &quot;to get right away out of the Russian muddle&quot;.   In these words the late leader of the Lett party In the Imperial Duma expressed to the writer the extreme views of his followers upon this topic.    They now harbour the hope of complete independence, and with a view to this he had   visited the U.S.A. in 1916 and succeeded in founding a Lettish-American Bank on a considerable scale in Boston. It is obvious that a small State such as Latvia would be inevitably swung sooner or later into the orbit of one or other of the adjoining Great Powers.   The same would be true in a less degree in connection with another proposal, favoured particularly by American Letts and Lithuanians, viz. that of linkage in a Republic with Lithuania. Not so practicable is still another proposal of a Confederation of all the Balkan Nationalities, Letts, Esthonians, Finns, Swedes, Danes and necessarily Norwegians.   It would seem as if the idea of a free Latvia in a free Russia were still the most reasonable.
It appears that on July 30/August 12 a Conference was held at Riga by the Committee of tho Temporary Vidzem (LIvonian) Land Council to deal with the question of the autonomy of Latvia, which was attended by representatives of the public organisations. The following resolutions were passed unanimously:(1) The Lettish nation, like all nations, has the right to complete settlement of Its own affairs.(2) Latvia must be indivisible and must comprise a united Livonia, Kurland and Latgalla (the N.W. section of Vitebsk Government).   In border districts the local inhabitants decide for themselves whether they wish to belong to Latvia or not.(3) Latgalia, as possessing the   distinguishing peculiarities of a component section of Latvia, must be granted Independent action *n matters relating to local self-government, language, school and church.(4) Latvia must be a politically autonomous component part of the Russian Republic, formed on democratic principles.(5) The legislation of autonomous Latvia, the executive tribunals and the authority of local self-government are within the jurisdiction of the people of Latvia and its Diet, elected on the basis of universal, direct, secret and proportional franchise without distinction of sex.(6) The Conference protests against annexations and in general opposes any attempt whatever to determine the legal position of Latvia or its separate parts without the knowledge and consent of the people of Latvia.The recent further retreats and capture of Riga have, however, put a different complexion upon the situation.   Bands of deserters from the retiring Russian troops have, on the testimony of the Russian Commissaries themselves, been guilty of excesses which
have gone far to restrain the loyalty of the Letts.   It has been clearly proved that buildings have been plundered, churches desecrated, crops pillaged and burned, live-stock and ether property carried off, archives destroyed and endless outrages perpetrated on the population by methods and in a spirit that had no relation to the exigencies of war.   The migration of the Lettish refugees has been directed towards the Governments of Viatka and perm and Western Siberia, a movement which seems to threaten the very existence of the Lettish nation and will provide Germany with more reason than ever for colonising these lands with her own people.   She is endeavouring to come to an understanding with such Of the Lettish people as have remained, and circumstances which could earlier have been disregarded must now receive serious consideration.   Thus there was a telegraphic reference to a meeting of the Landtag at Mitau on September 21, composed of the nobility and other deputies, from which a petition had been sent praying for &quot;the protection and support of His Majesty the German Emperor and of the powerful 0German Empire&quot;.   Previous to the fall of Riga and the subsequent happenings such information might have been rated sOmply as something given out through the German wireless, as it was.   To-day the danger of the gravitation of the Letts towards Germany is real, and steps could probably only be taken to avert it in the direction of a joint Allied declaration of full autonomy (subject to the consent of the Russian Government) as was done in the case of Poland, with respect for the rights of minorities.21.11,17.
