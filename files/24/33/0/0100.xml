SECRET.-G.-T. W^.THE LABOUR SITUATION. Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 28th November, 1917.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The Labour and food situations are discussed.Part II: Press Opinions.Press criticism is chiefly directed to the debate in the House of Commons on the Prime Minister&apos;s Paris speech, to the Regulation as to the censorship of pamphlets, and to the inauguration of the Comrades of the Great War.Part III: District Reports.Labour conditions are most serious in the North Midlands, where an important strike is in progress at Coventry, in the North-Western district, where the Railway workers display unrest and the Barrow Shop Stewards are excited over the non-unionist question, and on the Clyde, where the position is anxious.* Part IV: Strikes.The strike at Coventry is the only matter of first-rate importance.Part V: Disputes.The question of an advance in wages to Railway workers and to workers in the Textile Trades is discussed.ColonelI. General Remarks.The Labour Situation.The partial settlement of the agitation for the 12^ per cent, advance to semi-skilled and unskilled workers has coincided with a very serious aggravation of the Labour situation in general. The strike at Coventry (to which reference is made in Section IV), which might in the first instance have been avoided, has now raised an exceedingly serious question of general principle, namely, the recognition of the shop stewards committees as authoritative entities apart from the Trade Unions. This is a question on which the advanced section of the Labour world might very well prove to be at one, and which, incidentally, lends itself to easy and obvious manipulation and misrepresentation. There is grave danger of the strike spreading to Leicester and Nottingham, and it cannot be doubted that the sympathy of Sheffield, Manchester, Barrow, and the Clyde will be with the shop stewards of Coventry in their struggle.The Clyde and Barrow areas are both in an excited state on local grounds, the agitation in the former district being more serious than in the latter.The refusal by the N.U.R. to accept an advance of 5s. raises another serious industrial problem, and it is impossible to foresee how the situation may develop, but the future is undoubtedly anxious. Any extensive stoppage on the Railways is likely to precipitate sympathetic action with Coventry among Engineers, who would otherwise remain at work.   The indications are against a strike on the[1100-6] &quot; BPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.
railways in Yorkshire, but the omens for Lancashire and South &quot;Wales are less favourable.Finally, the Textile workers in the cotton areas have made demands of which the satisfaction seems improbable, while at the same time the industry is faced with widespread unemployment owing to an inadequate supply of raw material, and is affected by the withdrawal of the levy payment.There are thus the materials for a very widespread and important industrial upheaval, the importance of which would be aggravated by the shortage of food and high prices.The Food Question.The gravity of the situation in respect of food has developed with remarkable rapidity, and in two directions. The larger problem is instanced by a one-day strike at Coventry on Saturday last to protest against the inadequate control of prices, and the general engineering strike now in progress there, though primarily due to other causes, is no doubt largely fanned by the discontent due to food shortage. The other and possibly the more serious problem is the attempt which is being made with some success to accentuate the existing class feeling by wide advertisement of the facility with which the rich obtain luxuries, the cost of which precludes the working class from their enjoyment. The &quot; Herald &quot; has this week made a special point of this form of agitation, and prints three articles on the subject. The paper sent a representative to the Ritz, and the description of the dinner, which, for himself and one other, cost 31., forms the subject of a highly critical article, which concludes with these words: &quot; These notes will, we hope, put an end to the miserable suspicions entertained by the lower orders that the rich are better off than themselves in war-time. The war, we know, has levelled everyone.&quot;The fallacy of the argument is obvious, but it is ill to argue with a hungry man, and there can be no question that the effect of such a description on those who are finding it difficult to obtain even the most ordinary necessaries of life will be very powerful.II. Press Opinions.Criticism of the Government.The debate in the House of Commons on Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Paris Speech supplies a subject of comment for the Labour press, and though it is admitted that the Prime Minister had the better of the argument in the House, it is suggested that the attack was not sufficiently determined to attract the support which, had it been more vigorous, it would have received. The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; says: Mr. Lloyd George had an easy triumph over Mr. Asquith. It is difficult, after Mr. Asquith&apos;s speech, to understand why he raised the matter at all. He had no effective criticism to offer either of the proposals of the Eapallo Agreement or of Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s Paris speech. With the former he practically agreed without criticism, and his comments upon the latter were mild and ineffective. Mr. Asquith will never bring Mr. Lloyd George down with such ammunition as he used on Monday.&quot;The &quot;Herald&quot; writes:-&quot; After many alarums and excursions Mr. Lloyd George, with his usual agility and good luck, has managed to scrape through. We are told that he held the House of Commons spellbound; that Mr. Asquith and Mr. Chamberlain watched him with eyes which simply sparkled with enthusiasm.   .   .   .   We have read of such things before.&quot;The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer&quot; quotes from the critical speeches delivered by Colonel Lynch and Mr. Pringle, which, it alleges, were not reported in the press.The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; is at pains to point out that the fact of the triumph of the Prime Minister does not alter the military and political situation, and comments: &quot; The &apos; impenetrable barrier &apos; on the Western front will not fall under a dose of eyewash administered to the House of Commons. The criminal and costly blunders he described in Q Paris are still laid at the door of Mr. Lloyd George the man who is more responsible than any statesman of the Allies for the direction of the war. The Prime Ministers political strategy and rhetorical eyewash may enable him to retain office and some measure of popularity for some time longer, but every day it is becoming clear to larger numbers that he has neither the genius nor capacity for the task.&quot;
The Censoring of Pamphlets.The regulation on the subject of the censorship of pamphlets is attacked with great bitterness in many of the Labour papers, and also in an outspoken article in the &quot;Nation,&quot; headed &quot;The Assassination of Opinion.&quot; The following-extract is taken from this article:-&quot; If there is one. time more than another in which liberty of opinion and expression is most urgently required it is in such times of national peril as that in which we are living. For it is then that the precipitate, arbitrary, and uncriticised judgments of a Government are most ruinous. The stifling of free discussion in Parliament, the press, and the people has been largely responsible for the dangerous and costly misdirection of our national resources during the war.&quot;The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; imputes the responsibility for the regulation to &quot;the dictatorship of a section of the London press,&quot; and considers that the issue of the regulation&quot; creates a situation of the utmost gravity. It is the suppression of all opinion which is not favourable to the Government. It constitutes a Government official, whose identity is unknown, the censor of public opinion. It is but one small step further to the application of a similar censorship to the newspapers.&quot;The &quot;Woolwich  Pioneer&quot; erroneously states that discussion of war aimsand peace terms is prohibited by this new regulation, and suggests that it is thework of &quot;our masters.&quot;   It writes: &quot; Labour must speak, and if needs be act, in no uncertain manner if we are not to emerge from this war shackled and fettered by regulations which will place Labour in the position of serfs and slaves to a possessing class with little soul and less mercy. Our masters have no illusion about the future, and are laying their plans accordingly. Every scrap of civil and industrial liberty that can be whittled away now is worth an army corps to them in the days following the war.&quot;The &quot;Merthyr Pioneer&quot; quotes from Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., the following extract with approval: &quot; I say deliberately that if we are going to have another Press Dictatorship, controlled by one who refuses to accept responsibility, and merely looks upon his mission as that of the unmaker of Governments and Ministers, then it is time that Labour stood four square to defeat it.&quot;The &quot;Bradford Pioneer&quot; discusses the question under the heading &quot;The Panic of the Bolo Press. War on the Pacifists.&quot; It considers that the Northcliffe press has been once more successful in dictating the policy of the Government.&quot; The steady growth of pacifism, the all-pervading sickness and horror of the nation on the subject of the war, and the ever-increasing anger against our stupid and callous Cabinet, has at last got on the nerves of both jingo press and jingo rulers. . . . This ordinance brings us more probably into line with that great and free (sic) nation, the Republic of America.&quot;At another place this paper writes: Meanwhile Sir Edward the Ulster treason-monger has charge of the Government machinery for combating the pacifist preaching in England. As an authority on sedition, rebellion, and treason we suppose he has no equal in this country.&quot;&quot;Forward&quot; writes in a similar strain: This week will be a landmark in the story of our fight to maintain liberty. . . . The motives and influences which have moved the Government to plant the standard of Prussianism in our midst are the most unworthy and the most alien that have ever controlled policy in this country.   They are &quot;nurtured by the gutter press.   .   .The Conscription of Wealth.The agitation on the subject of the conscription of wealth continues, and encouragement is derived from the report of the deputation which waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this question. The contrast between the conscription of man power and immunity of capital still affords the chief argument against the conscription of wealth, the following typical extract is from the &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot;: &quot; Wealth ought to be conscripted for war purposes before everything else. The idea of making it more sacred than human beings has held&quot; sway too long, and every utterance which tends to educate public opinion in the direction of an alteration of this state of things is of great value.&quot;

The contrast between the conscription of man power and immunity of capital still affords the chief argument against the conscription of wealth.

The idea of making it more sacred than human beings has held&quot; sway too long, and every utterance which tends to educate public opinion in the direction of an alteration of this state of things is of great value.&quot;
Comrades of the Great War.The inauguration of the movement known as &quot; The Comrades of the Great &quot;War &quot; has been noticed in a hostile manner by some of the Labour papers, special stress being laid on the unfortunate use of the expressions &quot; Boloism&quot; and &quot;German Gold&quot; by distinguished speakers with reference to certain disabled soldiers at the inaugural meeting. On this point the &quot;Leicester Pioneer &quot; bitterly contrasts the services rendered by the discharged soldiers, who were ejected from the meeting, with the Guildhali Banquet for which the Lord Mayor is chiefly renowned. The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; insists on the bourgeois character of the move-ment which, it suggests, is intended to secure the activities of discharged soldiers in support of class and political interests.   It writes: &quot; This movement is one which every self-respecting soldier ought to shun. The aristocrats and wealthy people who are organising and controlling this movement are working in a great many directions to secure the gratitude of the discharged men. . . . Every possible means are being employed to prevent the men from organising their own welfare on democratic lines.&quot;In another part of the paper the following appears: &quot; The best thing discharged soldiers and sailors can do is to join the National Associa-tion, which has now branches in nearly every large town. It is working in connection with the trade unions, and for that reason will be a useful instrument, not only in looking after the rights of the men, but also in preventing interested people from putting the workers and the soldiers at loggerheads with each other. Trade unionism must capture the ex-Serviee men for the sake of trade unionism, and trade unionism must capture the country for the sake of the ex-Service man.&quot;III. District Reports.London.The situation is normal in the London area. No strikes are in progress; the last case of trouble among aeroplane workers, which had resulted in a strike at Messrs. Gwynne&apos;s, Chiswick, was successfully settled at a conference held between the firm and the Union officials.The agitation among the unskilled time-workers on the subject of the 12^ per cent, award came to an end with the extension of the award so as to include them-selves. The skilled men at Woolwich are, however, still grumbling at the smallness of the advance, which they complain does not put them on a level with semi-skilled piece-workers.The food question continues to be one of the chief causes of unrest, and the queues outside the shops are said to have been longer than ever. The tea shortage continues, and in addition, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to obtain butter.South-W estern.Considerable unrest has been observed among employees in the Admiralty dock-yards along the South Coast, over the question of their inclusion in the 12^ per cent, increase, and the men are reported to have resolved upon a &quot;slack up &quot; policy if their demands are not met.The representative of the Ministry of Munitions in Cornwall reports serious unrest in that quarter. Insubordination and a tendency to sabotage has been observed.The situation in the Isle of Wight (see Section IV) has been much relieved by &apos; the action of the Coal Controller.West Midlands.Indications of the very serious strike which has occurred at Coventry (described in Section IV) have not been wanting during the past few weeks, and have been referred to in these reports. The continuance of this acute unrest is, no doubt, very largely due to the food question, which has already been the occasion of a protest strike, and to the housing problem, which, with the possible exception of Barrow and Glasgow, is probably more serious here than anywhere else in the country.The extremists in the shop steward movement, among whom the most prominent are Cassidy, Dingley (both arrested last May), Stanley Pierpoint, and Dixon, have
known how to take advantage of these legitimate gievances. There has also&quot; been observable a somewhat harsh and reactionary attitude on the part of the employers, most of whom ,have not, in the past, been accustomed to handling such large numbers of employees, or to dealing with such delicate problems as have presented themselves during the war.There is considerable restlessness in Birmingham and Wolverhampton among the sheet-metal workers, who claim that they also should receive the V2\ per cent, advance.Yorkshire and East Midlands.In Yorkshire, the recommendations of the Whitley Committee continue to attract considerable and sympathetic consideration. A meeting of the postal employees held at Leeds on the 18th, after discussing the report fully, unanimously resolved that the procedure outlined ought to be applied in their case.More important is a decision of the Leeds City Council, reached during the week, by which the principles of the report were adopted, and a joint board con-stituted, consisting of seven members of the Council and seven members of the Trade Unions.The Leeds Labour Party has entered a strong protest against the attitude of the Government towards the Education Bill.This body is said to be tinged with pacifism, and the pacifists have, during the past week, somewhat increased their activities, though there is no indication that they have made any impression. An attempt by Mrs. Philip Snowden to hold a meeting at Todmordeu failed.At Sheffield there is much bitterness between the A.S.E. and the Allied Trades Council, owing to the attitude of the former in connection with demands by members of the latter for inclusion in the 12^ per cent, award. The Sheffield shop stewards are in close touch with the leaders of the strike at Coventry.The movement among the Yorkshire garment workers for a general increase in wages of 100 per cent, on pre-war rates shows signs of coming to a head. It is backed by some of the most powerful Unions in Yorkshire.The conference of the N.U.R., at Leicester, has continued, and is of importance in regard to the demands of the railwaymen, which are referred to in Section V. The railwaymen at Leeds appear indisposed to stirike, but those at Sheffield are more restive.North- Western.The situation in the engineering trade has improved considerably since the extension of the 12-^ per cent, award.Various meetings of railwaymen have been held in connection with the recent wages negotiations, and a most intractable attitude has been displayed. A &quot;go-slow &quot; strike has been begun, and an appeal from Mr. J. LI. Thomas, M.P., has been ignored. The result is that considerable congestion is already being created. The men think they are poorly paid, as compared with other transport workers.At Liverpool, the employers have now definitely refused to recognise the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, in connection with demands which have been put forward on behalf of clerks in their employ. The men demand recognition by the 12th December, and express their intention of taking drastic action if it is refused.The Liverpool carters, in accepting the employers&apos; offer of an increased wage, have expressed the hope that this will not be followed by an immediate rise in food prices, and have condemned profiteering. This subject was also the central theme at a meeting of the Mersey Engineering and Shipbuilding Federation, and was referred to at a. conference of the N.U.R. at Manchester.At Barrow, the shop stewards have passed an important series of resolutions in regard to the non-unionist question. A number of the extremists are in favour of striking on this question, but the President of the Committee, Henderson, is standing out against such action.The engineers employed in the railway workshops at Barrow are still agitating for the district flat rate, and have expressed an intention of ceasing work on Friday night unless their demand is met. In the event of this strike maturing, there is some possibility of the shop stewards engineering a general strike at Barrow.[1100-6] C
Northern.There is still unrest among workers in the shipyards, otherwise the situation is normal.At Carlisle, there is discontent owing to the difference between the liquor restrictions there and at Gretna.South Wales.The situation among the coalminers appears to be somewhat easier, though food prices continue to be a fruitful cause of unrest. An important meeting, repre-sentative of some 20,000 trade unionists and co-operators, was held on Saturday, and passed a resolution in favour of the Government taking over all food supplies and making arrangements for their distribution.The railwaymen have expressed themselves in favour of taking a strong line on the wages question, and there is also unrest among the shipwrights owing to continuous demarcation disputes between themselves and the joiners.The Clyde.The situation on the Clyde continues to give ground for anxiety. A mass meeting of several thousands of workers was held a,t Glasgow Green on Sunday under the auspices of the C.W.C. Three resolutions were passed, the first demanding the release of certain interned Russians, the second demanding the exten-sion of the 12^ per cent, award to all workers in the engineering trade, and the third extending the moral support of the Clyde workers to the women in the East Hope Street strike (see Section IV), unless the trouble is settled during the week. The last resolution was taken as meaning by the words moral support, sympathetic action to the extent of downing tools, and is undoubtedly the only one which needs to be taken seriously.McManus and Gallacher have been particularly prominent in this agitation.There have been a number of small strikes among the men engaged in ship-building and munition work, which are significant of the state of feeling in the district. The local representative of the Shipyard Labour Department reports that unrest is particularly acute among the electrical trades.IV. Strikes.The strike at Cowes which involved between 6,000 and 7,000 men came to an end on the 22nd.The men held a ballot and by a majority of 700 accepted the Coal Controller^ offer to reduce the price of coal in the Isle of Wight by 10s. per ton. This decision was no doubt influenced by a further promise that arrangements would, be made in regard to transport, by which a further substantial reduction in price will be effected during the winter.At Coventry trouble, which has for some time been brewing at the firm of White and Poppe, came to a head on the 20th, when the toolmakers and setters ceased work over a dispute as to rates of wages and the recognition of shop stewards.There has been a considerable strengthening of the shop steward movement in Coventry of late, and the Chief Investigation Officer of the Ministry of Munitions in that district has reported that the movement is very unfavourably regarded by the employers. Mr. Poppe, the manager of the firm, refused to meet the shop stewards, who waited on him in a body to put forward then views on the question of piece rates. The men were very angry, and the strike, which has involved about 2,000 female employees of the firm, immediately ensued.Considerable sympathy has been shown with the attitude of the shop stewards at Messrs. White and Poppe, and as a result a meeting of 500 shop stewards was held on the 23rd, at which the whole question was discussed.The situation has been aggravated by the question of food prices, which is particularly acute at Coventry, and by the dismissal of shop stewards and others at various important works on the ground of shortage of work. These men have not been able to find work, though in some instances their old places have already been filled.On Monday morning a meeting of the shop stewards was held, at which it was announced that arrangements had definitely been made for a general strike in the event of the demand for recognition still being refused.Later on in the day practically all the workers in the town ceased work. They are still out, and a large amount of work of essential importance is held up.
The position cannot be regarded as other than very serious, and the shop stewards are reported to be in close touch with the, men at several firms in Birmingham, who they hope will act in sympathy, while attempts are being made to bring out the men at Nottinghamrwand LeicesterThe report from the Shipyard Labour Department contains references to ten strikes which have occurred during the week, and to nine which have been previously mentioned.A small but significant strike occurred among the platers employed by a firm at Sunder-land over the alleged victimisation of a foreman. It eventually turned out that the man/s resignation was &quot;in no way due to action by the firm, and the strikers thereupon resumed work.The important strike of engineers and others at Belfast over the 12J per cent, advance, which was described in last week&apos;s Report, so far as the men employed in the shipyards are concerned, came to an end on Saturday last.   A number of men employed on other work are, however, still idle. The War Office Contracts Department reports five cases of stoppage as having been in progress during the week.The Coal Controller reports that seven strikes have been in progress during the week. Two of these appear for the first time, and in one case work has been resumed.In the Sutton Colliery case, which has involved about 1,000 men for several weeks, it is expected that work will shortly be resumed, as a joint deputation of owners and miners met at the offices of the Coal Controller on Monday. The cause of the trouble is the non-unionist question.The strike among the workers on the Manchester Sbip Canal spread during the later part of last week to Warrington and Euncorn, so that as many as 1,500 men were involved. The men have decided to- send a deputation to the Canal Control Commission, and mean-while the majority of them appear to be resuming work, though no settlement has yet been reached.The Ministry of Munitions reports six cases of strike as having been in progress during the last week, and that three of these have been settled.In addition to these there was a series of strikes in the Burnley district over the 12i per cent, question. This was also the cause of strikes at four other works in different parts of the country. These strikes, which involved a considerable number of men, have all come to an end in consequence of the extension of the award.The strike at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s Works at East Hope Street, Glasgow (referred to in last week&apos;s Report) has not yet been settled, though there is a prospect of an early return to . work. The Clyde Workers&apos; Committee have, as usual, mixed themselves up in the affair, and are threatening to bring out the whole of the Clyde area over this case. Messrs. Beardmore have offered to pay the wages of the four women whose dismissal caused the strike pending the outcome of the enquiry which has been suggested by the Ministry of Munitions, and provided the A.S.E. will withdraw.the embargo which they have placed on tool-setting for the women who did not cease work.A strike of aeroplane woodworkers at the Vulcan Engineering and Motor Co., Ltd. (Southport) is interesting, if only for the fact that the men allege that the Ministry of Munitions and the employers are in collusion to defeat them, and that, judging by the results achieved elsewhere by a policy of striking, they may hope for immediate success.V. Disputes.By far the most important dispute which is in progress at the present time is that which has arisen out of an application of an advance of 10s. which was made to the railway companies by the National Union of Railwaymen. This application was met by a refusal, but a counter offer of 5s. was at the same time put forward.A general conference of the N.U.R. was held at Leicester last week, and before this the 5s. offer was placed. Opinion was overwhelmingly in favour of refusing it, and as many as twelve out of the sixty delegates present were in favour of standing out for the whole 20s. as originally demanded, but the others were apparently in favour of accepting 10s. should it be offered.A further meeting of delegates was held on Saturday. The proceedings were in private, but at the conclusion, Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., said that further % negotiations were in progress, and impressed on the delegates the urgent necessity of avoiding a strike.Meanwhile the attitude of the members of the N.U.R. in various parts of the country is distinctly uncompromising. Crowded meetings have been held at Derby, Manchester, Burnley, Willesden, Cardiff, and Barrow (amongst other places), and
resolutions have been passed supporting the action of the executive, and deciding to stand by them whatever the consequences. At Liverpool, which is in the hands of the extremists, the executive was strongly censured for not having put forward the application for the full 20s. as it originally stood on the programme, and a &quot;go-slow&quot; strike has begun (see District Reports).It would appear that some districts, Yorkshire for example, while not prepared to accept the 5s., would be satisfied with 7s. Qd.It is, however, almost certain that if the negotiations now proceeding result in an offer of anything less than 10s. sporadic strikes among the railwaymen will occur in places where lively unrest exist, though no national stoppage is likely to take place.The men employed in the L.S.W.R. Company&apos;s shops at Eastleigh, who were recently on strike, are threatening to come out again. The case was referred to arbitration, and should have been heard by the Committee on Production on Friday last. At the last moment, however, a deputation arrived from Eastleigh, which refused to submit the question, which is one of district rates, to the Com-mittee as that body had recently given an adverse decision in a similar case. They demand a special court under Clause &quot; C,&quot; Schedule I, and negotiations on this point are proceeding.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 189 controversial cases as having been under consideration during the past week.This marks a decline of 11, chiefly due to a marked drop in the number of eases reported from the Clyde.   The number of cases which have been settled is given as 39.No settlement has yet been reached in the dispute over rivetters&apos; rates on the Clyde and at Aberdeen.   The leaders are doubtful whether they can hold their men in much longer.With regard to the dispute over an award to plumbers in the same area, negotiations have been taking place in London, and it is hoped to reach a settlement during the week.The Coal Controller reports that ten disputes, not involving a stoppage, have been in progress during the week.Three of these are new cases and one case has been successfully settled.Arising out of the recent disputes, in South Wales over the prosecution of miners who had struck work, an arrangement has been reached between the Owners&apos; Association and the Miners&apos; Federation for a joint committee to investigate the relationships between the management of the collieries and the men, with a view to avoiding the stoppages of work without notice, which have been so frequent of late. This may mark a revolution in the attitude of capital and labour towards each other in South Wales, if it is the beginning of co-operative action as opposed to mutual hostility.The War Office Contracts Department&apos;s report indicates a considerable increase in the unrest existing in the industries controlled by that Department. In addition to the strikes already mentioned, at least twelve disputes not involving stoppages have occurred.By far the most important of these arises out of the applications which are being put forward by textile operatives in Lancashire, The spinners are asking for a 50 per cent, advance on pre-war rates, which is equivalent to 30 per cent, on present wages. The masters have offered 10 per cent, on the 8th December and a further 10 per cent, in March next.   This offer has been rejected.Yesterday the Northern Manufacturers&apos; and Spinners&apos; Association heard an application on behalf of 200,000 weavers for a further 50 per cent, advance in wages, in addition to the 20 per cent, already granted since the outbreak of war. The employers offer 10 per cent, in December and a further 5 per cent, in February. This will be discussed by the operatives on Friday, but they are not likely to accept it.An important application by the Woolworkers&apos; Federation for increased rates for wool-sorters and others has been refused by the British Association of Woolbuyers. It is not yet known what attitude the men will take.Unrest in leather, jute, and hosiery trades continues.The Ministry of Munitions has only six cases of dispute not involving stoppages, and of these one has been settled.This was a case of victimisation, and the employer admitted that he had dismissed the man for being an agitator, and offered to restore him. One of the other cases is the alleged victimisation of C. A. Kealey, the notorious Manchester shop steward, by Messrs. Crossley Bros.The Committee on Production has heard during the past week twenty-one cases, all of them in London. The most important of these was a general applica-tion for an advance of wages in the shipbuilding trade.D. J. SHACKLETON.g
