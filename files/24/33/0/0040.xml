Operations.From:-   General Plumer, Italy.To:-       C.I.G.S., War Office.Repeated Advanced G.H.Q., France.Handed in at 12.2 a.m., 23.11.17 Received at 8 p.m., 23.11.17.0.40.   November 22nd.The two attacks delivered by the enemy to-day against Mont Tomba and faont Fenera were more serious than any made during the last few days.   They were made by about six battalions. The Italians counter-attacked and recovered the positions lost, They anticipate that these attacks will be renewed.    I saw Foch, Fayolle, and Diaz to-day and we have arranged forward movement of French and British Divisions so as to be within supporting distance as soon as possible if enemy attacks develop.     I have explained both to Foch and Diaz the reasons for the temporary delay in the despatch of the two extra divisions.     Foch said the French would be able to utilize the trains.
