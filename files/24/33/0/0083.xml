WAR CABINET.

RANK AND TITLES OF OFFICERS OF THE AIR FORCE.

(Memorandum by General Smuts.)

The Air Organisation Committee considered the question of nomenclature for officers and other ranks of the Air Force, and forwarded, for the remarks of the Admiralty and Army Council, the following list, for officers :-

Air Marshal

Admiral

Vice-Admiral

Rear-Admiral

Commodore (temporary rank).

Colonel

Commander

Major

Captain

Lieutenant

Ensign.

The Admiralty replied that the use of Naval titles was objectionable, even with the prefix "AIR"; that any mixture of Naval and Military titles would be a compromise open also to objection; and that it would be best either to use Military titles in toto, or to adopt fabricated titles suggestive of the air. On this latter point, however, they were unable to offer any suggestions.

The War Office replied that it was highly desirable, if not essential, that the titles should be quite distinct from those which appertain to either the Navy or the Army; and further that the proposal to give Naval titles to senior officers and Military titles to junior officers would cause much comment and resentment.

I do not consider it desirable to handicap the new service at the outset by giving its officers fabricated titles, which, however, carefully devised, would lend themselves to facetious criticism, and might easily be made rediculous. The Service members of the Air Organisation Committee are prepared to accept either Naval or Military titles, or a mixture of the two, but consider that any prefix such as "Air" would at once place the new Service in a position of inferiority. As the Naval and Military titles at present in use are almost all of foreign origin, and are used by all nations, I consider the objections of the Navy and Army not very well founded. I therefore suggest that either Naval or Military titles should be used by Air Force. I am of opinion that Military titles would be more convenient, and their adoption is in effect suggested by the Admiralty.
