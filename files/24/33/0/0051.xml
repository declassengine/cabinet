%0n27/Gen.No./6622.(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic IVialssty-s Government)WAR CABINET.Recruiting for the Army, Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,I append a note on the subject of recruiting which represents the views of the War Office on this important and urgent matter and which I should like the War Cabinet to consider at the earliest possible date in connection with&apos;the memorandum by the Minister of National Service (G.174) on the same subject,DERBY. . .24th November, 1917.
On 31st May, 1917 the Adjutant General laid before the Army Council a Memorandum on the position and prospects of Recruiting.     This was forwarded to the War Cabinet with a covering note dated 7th June, in which the following words occur:&quot;From what is stated in the Memorandum it seems clear that practically, the Army is now provided with men only after all other needs of the Nation have been cared for.   Unless this policy is changed, the strength of the Army will continue rapidly to diminish, and, so far as military operations are concerned, our chances of winning the Yi/ar will be correspondingly reduced&quot;.Since the date of this Memorandum, the recruiting figures, both of men for General Service and those of other categories, have steadily declined.     In the month of May, 1917, a total of 88,494 men of all categories was taken, while in October last, the intake had diminished to 36,543.During the first 15 days of the current month we have only taken 7,481 Category &quot;A&quot; men, of whom less than 3,000 are over 18 years and 8 months.     This means that during the current month we shall in all probability secure less than 15,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men, of whom not 6,000 will be over 18 years and 8 months.The average monthly wastage in all theatres of war which has to be replaced amounts to 74,600 mer.     It is established that of men returned to England sick and wounded, 20,000 become available as reinforcements each month.     Therefore it is evident, in view of the diminishing number of recruits, that unless immediate measures are taken either to reduce the Forces now in the Field, and thus lessen the drain upon the drafting machine, or to provide at once an adequate flow of mature recruits above the age of 18 years and 8 months, the Forces in the various theatres of war will in a very short time become ineffective through want of men, and further that men will not be available for new units such as Artillery, R.F.C., etcThe present deficiency on War Establishment in alltheatres of war is -Infantry ............ 75,500Labour     ............ 16,000Other Arms..........      Hil.The failure of Recruiting has, during the last half year, been repeatedly brought to the notice of the War Cabinet. On the 17th July, 1917, and again on the 18th August, Memoranda urging that some action should be taken were passed by the Secretary of State to the War Cabinet, whilst during the first week of every month a Return is rendered to the Secretary of the War Cabinet giving the Recruiting figures of the year up to date, with a footnote drawing attention to any important points connected therewith.     Since the month of July these footnotes have month by month drawn attention to the failure of Recruiting, and on the 6th October a covering Memorandum was attached to the monthly figures, in which special attention was drawn to, the existing position.Without entering into detail, if the Forces in the Field are to be kept up to their present establishment, 250,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men are required during the current month, and 50,000 during each month from December, 1917, to June, 1918.The
The Minister of rational Service has submitted a paper to the War Cabinet in regard, to the general outlook of national Kan-power, wherein several suggestions are made with a view   cf obtaining a few men.     Generally speaking, the conclusion arrived at is that unless the Government see their way to taking drastic action in order to provide men, It is impossible that more than one third of the requirements of the Army will be met.Great stress has been laid an the fact that there are at the present moment in this country over 500,000 Category &quot;Art men.     It must, however, be understood that in this figure are included:-Units preparing for overseas ............... 18,368Draft-finding units .........301,650Home Service ..........V.. ................. 112,439of which more than half are A.iv men in Home Service Divisions,The Depots and Administrat ive. units contai n approximately............................. 100,000cf which Cadet Units, Amy Service Corps and R.P.C. form the bulk.The A.S.C. and 11,1&apos;. C. men are practically all tradesmen, and while it is recognised that pledges given in regard to skilled mechanics apply enly to the metal trades, it must be remembered that skilled tradesmen have to be replaced, and the competition at the present moment between the various Departments of the State preclude the hope that any considerable number of these men can bo replaced by skilled labour cf lower categories.Sterjs have been, and are being, taken to reduce the Fcrces at Home in every possible way, but even if more drastic action is taken, which mi^ht result in delaying training and hampering departmental \ ork, the net results vould be so small as hardly to affect the l;.rge deficit of m ture &quot;A&quot; men with which we Te faced.The situation demands immediate action, either in the direction of admitting that the country is unable to-maintain the Forces now in the Field, and the consequent reduction of those Porces within&quot;the limits of our available man-power, or such steps on the part of the Government as will at once make good the oxisting deficit in theatres of war, and enable the Armies to be maintained during the comin,: year at their present establishment.
