[This document is the Property of His Majesty&apos;s Government.]THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUBMARINE UPON NAVALPOLICY AND OPERATIONS.Memorandum for the War Cabinet by the First Sea Lord.The object of this paper is to point out the great effect upon naval policy caused by the advent of the submarine in large numbers.So long as enemy submarines are able to leave their bases and become free to act in open waters, they force upon their opponents the necessity for providing that all vessels of moderate or heavy draft are accompanied by small high-speed vessels of comparatively shallow draft. Otherwise it is only a question of time before the submarine sinks the large vessel.This axiom has been realised by the German Navy to such an extent that it is entirely exceptional for any German war vessel of any class bigger than a destroyer to proceed to sea without at least two destroyers being attached to her. So far as the German Navy is concerned, this necessity has not imposed upon it any very great strain, since in the North Sea German vessels larger than destroyers proceed outside the protection of their minefields only on the most rare occasions. This is exemplified by the fact that between August 1916 and September 1917 no German vessel large)&apos; than a destroyer is known to have proceeded further than 150 miles from Heligoland.With the British Navy, however, the case is entirely different, as our vessels are necessarily constantly at sea. The strain imposed upon our destroyers for purely Fleet work has, therefore, been immense. The number of destroyers allotted to the Grand Fleet is 100, exclusive of flotilla leaders, but of this number there are always at least one-third engaged in the convoy of merchant vessels, both British, Allied, and Neutral, and very often the number of destroyers so employed is considerably higher. The method of submarine warfare adopted by the enemy against merchant ships has also necessitated the employment of a very large number of destroyers for convoy and escort work outside the North Sea, and the protection of the sea communications of our armies overseas has imposed upon us a further and very considerable strain of the same nature.Taking all these facts into consideration, it is not too much to say that the whole of our naval policy is necessarily governed by the adequacy of our destroyer forces. Intended operations have to be constantly postponed because there is not a sufficient number of destroyers available for the service required, and we are always faced with the risk that whilst our available destroyers are being used for one operation, the enemy may take some step which would necessitate a move on the part of our Grand Fleet, in which case the Fleet might have to go to sea with an entirely inadequate destroyer force to accompany it.The dangers of such a step are obvious. The big ships would be open to submarine attack all the time they were at sea, and should a Fleet action result, our Fleet would be at a serious disadvantage with the High Sea Fleet. There is no possibility of the High Sea Fleet ever moving to sea without at least eight flotillas of destroyers to accompany it (a total number of 88 destroyers), and should a Fleet action be fought with the Germans possessing that number of destroyers, whilst we were in the quite conceivable position of having less than half that number, the results-more particularly in weather of low visibility might well be disastrous.The position in this respect is much accentuated by the duty which devolves upon the Grand Fleet of being always held ready to deal with landing raids and coastal bombardments. If likely landing places and positions of importance were adequately defended by land forces or by coast fortifications, as is the case with our enemies, the Fleet would be freed from this great embarrassment and would be far better placed to take offensive action under conditions of our own choice.There is yet another aspect of the case. Owing to the influence of the submarine on naval warfare and the consequent necessity above mentioned for destroyers always accompanying large ships, the radius of action of the large ships is reduced to that of the destroyers, and not only the radius of action, but also the possibility of keepingo  (33) AS 4208   Pk 60   11/17   E&amp;S
the sea, for if the weather is too had for destroyers to maintain the Fleets speed, the Oommander-in-Chief is faced with two alternatives, either of which is fraught with serious possibilities. One is to reduce the speed of his Fleet in order to enable the destroyers to keep up, and the other is to do without the destroyers and to proceed at a high speed with the big ships. The speed of a destroyer is very quickly reduced in bad weather, and this is particularly the case in the short steep seas met with in the North Sea; and as regards radius of action, it cannot be said that a Fleet can keep the sea with certainty for more than 72 hours. This limitation does not affect the enemy, since his Fleet is never very far from its bases and can carry out any likely objective well within the time mentioned. The choice of time and place lies with him.In military strategy one of; the first principles always considered is that of: the possession of an adequate reserve. The British Fleet, since the beginning of the war, has not only never possessed any reserve of destroyers, but has never been supplied with a sufficient number for its ordinary work, and consequently operations have been hindered in every direction, and unfortunately they continue to be so hindered. The enemy, on the other hand, possesses far more destroyers than are required for any of the work which, up to the present, has been attempted by his naval forces ; he consequently always has a very considerable reserve. The only case in which it is probable that he has felt the need of more destroyers is in the recent Baltic operations, when there was thrown upon the German Navy in a very minor degree some of the responsibilities in connection with the Dan sport and maintenance of an army overseas as have fallen to the lot of the British Navy in ever increasing magnitude from the very first hour of the declaration of war.A perusal of the foregoing remarks will show the impossibility and the danger of embarking upon operations which require the use of destroyers without first fully considering whence the destroyers can be obtained, and what the effect will be upon other operations or other requirements from the destroyer point of view. It, may be added that there are no operations which do not necessitate the use of destroyers.The Grand Fleet is the centre and pivot on which all naval operations depend. It is true that its activity is confined to the North Sea, but on its very existence depends the possibility of carrying out the all-important operation of safeguarding our lines of communications. The safety and efficiency of the Grand Fleet depends to a large extent, as has been shown, on its destroyers, and to carry out any policy which involves a reduction in the number of the Grand Fleet destroyers increases the already considerable risks which we now take.The tremendous&apos; effect, therefore, of the submarine upon naval warfare will be realised, as will the extreme importance of the rapid addition to our destroyer force.To make good deficiencies in destroyers, the following steps are being taken : The British Shipbuilding programme provides for the construction of an additional 110 destroyers by the end of December 1018, the average rate of delivery being approximately seven destroyers a month. In addition, the programme provides for a total number of 45 sloops by December 1918, these vessels being largely used in relief for destroyers; and a total number of GO large trawlers of good speed are also in the programme up to the end of 1918, these vessels also being partly used to relieve destroyers for convoy work.The United States Navy have a programme up to the end of December 1918, of approximately 100 destroyers, the majority of which it is expected will be used in European waters, some of them working with the U.S. Battleships.Our casualties, however, in destroyers are fairly heavy, and therefore the total addition to our destroyer forces will be very considerably less than the figures quoted, and large numbers are required for prospective offensive operations.The attached table shows the destroyer position at various dates since the commencement of the war, but attention is called to the fact that a considerable number of the destroyers which are mentioned in that table are quite unsuited for anything but local work, owing to their age, their unseaworthiness, and in some cases their weak armament.   These destroyers are shown in separate columns.Requests are constantly being received -from Senior Officers of the various Fleets and Bases for additions to their destroyer strength, and, although every effort is of course made to meet these requests, the demands at the present time exceed the supply by a total number of 90 destroyers.   The demands are always on the increase.
The work which, is being done by the destroyers at some of the principal bases, excluding the Grand Fleet which has already been dealt with, may be summarised as follows : The Harwich Force requires its destroyers for all the offensive and defensive operations which are constantly being carried out and which include the weekly Dutch convoy, and operations in support of the Dover Force on the Belgian Coast, as well as minelaying in the Heligoland Bight.The Dover destroyers work in connection with the operations on the Belgian coast, anti-submarine operations in the Straits of Dover, and the protection of cross-channel vessels, of which an average of 20 cross daily in this area alone.The Portsmouth destroyers are very largely used for the protection of cross-channel traffic in that area, which includes a constant stream of troopships, hospital ships, munition and store ships, as well as the escort of merchant ships up and down Channel.The Devonport destroyers are mainly used for bringing in and taking out eonvo\Ts. In September, for instance, the number of vessels convoyed outwards was 211, and the number convoyed inwards was 161 in this area. This is in addition to the convoy of men-of-war and special merchant vessels.On the East Coast the whole of the destroyers are used for convoying the vessels in the East Coast traffic, which includes the Scandinavian convoy.At Queenstown the destroyers are used largely for convoy work. In September 101 vessels were convoyed in this area, and 108 were convoyed out.In the Mediterranean the destroyers are used for convoy work, for anti-submarine work at the Otranto Barrage, and for watching the Dardanelles entrance; also for operations on the Palestine Coast and in the JEgean. There are about 150 ships at sea daily in the Mediterranean, all of which are either under convoy or protected in some other way.It should, of course, be noted that in all areas available destroyers are used for offensive operations immediately an enemy submarine is located.18th November 1917.J.
