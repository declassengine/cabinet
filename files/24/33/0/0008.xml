i CO jJ This Document is the Pro-v:rty of /YJis Bnl annicj;&quot;^g ty^jgoyern.Tient.) &apos;Rayment of Conscientious Objectors retained inPost Office.Memorandum by the Po st na ste r Goneral.The Treasury have ruled in a Circular of the 10th February 1917 that (1) Conscientious Objectors in the Non-Combatant Corps toll be governed by the ordinary conditions as to pay etc, applicable, tc Civil Servants on military service, i.e. their military pay  shall be made up to their civil pay and their service shall court for pension and increment: (2) Conscientious Objectors exempted by Tribunals and allowed to Terrain on their Civil duties shall receive only their former actual rate of remuneration v/ithout increment:, or the rate which would be paid to a temporary substitute performing the duty, whichever is less, and their service shall not count for pension or increment.No question ariser as regards the men in the lion-Combatant Corps.   But the reduction of pay to be imposed on men retained in the Post Office (about 100 in number) will mean trouble vrith the Post Office Trades Unions,These men have, taken advantage of their statutory rights and are legally exempted from military service; they are retained in the Post Office as doing work of National importance only on the recommendation of the Tribunal concerned.   If their wages are reduced the Trades Unions fftll claim that they are being sweated.  And if a skilled man is reduced to the wages of a temporary substitute whose services cannot be of the same value, the charge vrill be difficult to mftQt.   If a telegraphist at 65/- a w&amp;e\ is reduced to 30/- a week, either he was very much overpaid before or he is very much underpaid after reduction.The system adopted by the Treasury also means that nopenalty
penalty is imposed on the man who takes advantage of other avenues of escape under the Military Service Act, such as domestic hardship, or goes into the Non-Combatant Corps. And the reduction of pay would work very unevenly; the young man at the bottom of the scale would lose extremely little, the older man at the top of the scale would have his wages reduced by 50$ or more,I have no sympathy with these people, but if they are employed at their ordinary Post Office work, they ought to get their ordinary wages.The imposition of these penalties savours of&quot; petty persecution and in my opinion is not worth the opposition -which it will provoke; and the difficulty of applying them is aggravated by lapse of time,   The Post Office Unions were told in August 1916, six months before the Treasury Circular was issued, that the men would be retained in the Post Office if the Tribunal recommended that course and no suggestion was made that reduction of pay would be involved. The instructions were issued by the Treasury without consulting the Post Office, and some of the men concerned have received their full pay for nearly 18 months,I should like the Wvr Cabinet to decide what course is to be pursued.(Signed)     A.H. ILLIHGWORTE,1 November 1917,
