Petrograd,

22nd November, 1917.

1508

General Manikovski showed me a telegram from STAVKA, dated 18th November, which stated that supplies of flour on that date were

On Northern front one day,

" Western front four days,

" South Western front nine days,

" Roumanian front six days.

15 wagons daily were being sent from south western front reserves to northern front and western front. The bread ration on northern front is now half pound and on western and south western fronts one pound daily. The services of transport and communication of course suffer in present disorder. Telegraphic communication with western Siberia has been out for several days.

Yesterday, 10,800 wagons were accumulated at Moscow. There are 3,000,000 *poods of grain in north Caucasus but it is feared that KALEDIN may prevent their transport.

N.B. The normal ?read ration of the Russian soldier in war is 2 lbs, 4 oz, (or 1 lb. 9.2 oz. of biscuit in lieu).

* 1 pood = 40 lbs.
