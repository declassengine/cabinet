From Viceroy, 21st November 1917. (Repeated to Tehran.) (Received 22nd, 11 a.m.)Secret. Bushire-Shiraz trade route. In continuation of my telegram o  to-dav. Following are our views. We agree with Cox that Bushire situation is most unsatisfactory.We have always considered conclusive military operations best solution if practicable. But apart from landing difficulties, which would hang up tonnage unduly prolonged, and transport difficulties, force required is not available or likely to be available in the near future, and we take it that His Majesty&apos;s Government would hesitate., in view of general war weariness, to authorise a South Persian expedition when the war is ending or ended. Thus there is no practical prospect, either now or in the future, of dealing ourselves with the situation by conclusive military operations.Alternative proposed by Cox that Darya Begi should be assisted to lake action against hostile Khans does not inspire confidence in view of his recent operations assisted by South Persia Rifles at Minah. We might, however, assist with some guns and machine guns, with necessary personnel, from Bushire garrison. But we would urge that a condition precedent to any such action should be a definite request from Persian Government for our aid. Even so we should acquiesce with utmost reluctance, in view of risk of loss of equipment and men, and of still further disturbing hinterland by a reverse.As regards proposed subventions through Farm an Parma we understand, from Foreign Office telegram dated 15th November, that His Majesty&apos;s Government are now averse from this proposal. This scheme appears to us an inconclusive half-measure little calculated to improve situation, but it seems better than assisting Darya Begi with material.In the circumstances, unless His. Majesty^ Government can see their way to reconsider their decision regarding a general settlement with hostile Khans, conveyed in your telegram of the 8th December 1916, there would appear nothing for it but to continue our present inactivity, fraught though it is with inconvenience and discredit to ourselves and difficulty to friendly Governor Darya Begi.Trevor has unfortunately been invalided home, and a new officer, probably Bill, will replace him. Should His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, be prepared to reconsider matter, there will be no personal difficulty in the way of inaugurating a change of policy. &amp;
