MOST SECRET.     Hojgp^ndurLfpr War Cabinet by Fir St., So a Lord,SITUATION IN THE BALTIC, The attached papers deal with the situation in the Baltic and the discipline of the Russian Ealtic Fleet. (1)     In regard to the question as to the possibility of the Russian Fleet being delivered treacherously to the Germans, Admiral Stanley in his telegram No.40 expresses ih e view that there is very little likelihood of this, but this view is not altogether shared by the Admiralty, and it is thought that therels some considerable measure of danger that something of this nature may be in contemplation,      Further enquiries are being made of Admiral Stanley (a.(2)    The question remains as to the action to be taken in regard to our submarines, as to which there has been some previous discussion in the Cabinet. The position is this:-The Russian Fleet is at Helsingfors, a harbour wibh but little depth of water and the entrances to which are very narrow and which are defended by nets and obstructions. The feasibility of our submarines torpedoing the Russian battleships to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy lias been considered.     If this action were taken, the battleships would sink in shallow water, provided they were sufficiently damaged, and there would be no great difficulty in raising and repairing them.     Owing to the formation of the harbour, it is almost certain that the submarines would n6t be able to get out after firing their torpedoes but would be destroyed by the Russians.    Further, such an act would presumably have a very great political effect in Russia, andthe consequences as regards the safety of the British colonies in Russia and our diplomatic representatives would be serious.There is the alternative, which has been suggested to
Admiral Stanley, of sons loyal Russian officers tailing steps to damage the ships so seriously as to prevent their use by the Germans at any rate for a considerable period. (3)    The next question to be considered is our action in regard to the Russian destroyers, which are more valuable certainly to ourselves and possibly to the Germans than the battleships.In the telegram to Admiral Stanley a certain line of action has been suggested.   As the discipline in the destroyers has always been better than in the battleships , it is con-ceivable that a sufficient number of patriotic officers and men might he found to bring the destroyers away, and, with assistance from us, it is possible that some of them could get out of the Baltic.    Even if they failed, it is probable that the majority could run themselves ashore and destroy their vessels in neutral waters.(4)     The final point for consideration is the action to be taken in regard to our submarines.     As to the 110U class,there can be no doubt:     they must be destroyed and their crews brought home.     In regard to the 4 UEU class boats, the crews are of considerably more value to us than the boats, which are old and probably in great need of repair.     The chances of getting them out of the Baltic are very slight indeed, and it would be of much greater value to us to have tho 4 crews of the 4 boats brought home than to have 2 boats and 2 crews, even supposing that 50$ of the boats got through, which is extremely improbable.   It is therefore proposed that , should circumstances necessitate, the boats should be destroyed and the crews brought home.(Sgd)    J.R.JELLICOE.Naval Staff,- 22nd November 1917.
MOST SECRET. ^^]n1ra.1tv Memorandum for War CabinetSITUATION IN THE BALTIC.Wfrval ForcesThe German naval forces at present in tho Eastern Baltic consist only of tho Baltic Scouting Group of throe Light Cruisers and two flotillas of destroyers.    These are based principally on Arensburg (Ssel).    Attempts by the Germans to salve the ships sunk in the Moon Sund have now been abandoned in view of the approach of ioo conditions.    The Russian Fleet is inside tho Gulf of Finland, based as followsBattleships at Helsingfors: Cruisers disposed between the ports of Revel, Helsingfors, Lapvik, and Ab$; destroyers and submarines at these bases, with a few in tho advanced bases of Hapsal and HangB, on either side of tho entrant to the Gulf of Finland.Military EogsssuGerman troops are still in occupation of tho islands of Dago, Bsel and Koon, and their linos on the mainland have been withdrawn to within a few miles north of Riga.    It is believed that the opposing Russian forces are in contact, but no operation has been recently reported.The German force landed previously on the Worder Peninsula has been withdrawn.State of the Russian Wavy.It would be difficult to exaggerate the hopeless lack of discipline which exists in the larger ships.     The destroyers and submarines, however, show more tendency to acknowledge disciplinary measures. This is the result of the necessarily closer contact between officers and men in these services, and the knowledge among the men that when at sea their lives would be in grave danger without the experience of their officers.    A considerable amount
of sympathy must be felt with the officers, although in the past through general indolence, lack of initiative, and entire want of consideration for their men, they have contributed to bringing upon themselves their present precarious condition. In these circumstances it is not surprising that there is little sympathy between officers and men: the former now have little authority, which is vested in the Ship!s Committees, and these decide whether any order is to be obeyed or not. Orders issued by the Admiralty are very carefully worded so as not to hurt the feelings of the men, and so promote direct disobedience: authority to move ships is vested entirely in the hands of the Comraander--in*-Chief, who is regarded to be a better judge of what orders stand a reasonable chance of being carried out.Any routine work, which is unpalatable is called &quot;old regime&quot;, and immediately vetoed.Apart from the all -important question of discipline, the big ships of the fleet are in pour trim to meet an enemy: they seldom go to sea, and more rarely carry out any exorcises. Against a well-disciplined and resolute enemy, they can hardly be regarded as a serious fighting force.    Though of relatively better fighting value, the destroyers and submarines have developed habits of breaking down a few miles out of harbour, with the result that the onus of patrol work falls largely on the British submarines in the Baltic.The Russians themselves put great faith in their minefields which are undoubtedly good.    These, with the addition of our submarines, constitute the only really serious obstacle to a German Fleet operating in these waters.

MOST SECRET. , , --(4).Letter from Rear Admiral Stanley to the Secretaryof the Admiralty.SITUATION IN THE BALTIC.State of Russian Navy.British Naval Liaison OffioerIn Russia.PETROGRAD. 17th/30th September, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to submit the following remarks on the state of the Russian Navy generally., based on information from sources which I regard as thoroughly trustworthy, with a view to making known the condition of affairs, as I am somewhat doubtful if a correct idea of this has been imparted.2m-    It would be difficult to exaggerate the hopeless laok of discipline which exists in the big ships.    The destroyers and submarines are distinctly better in this respeot, arising, doubtless, from the officers and men being brought more into contact with eaoh other than is the case in the larger ships; also when at sea the men are very well aware that, particularly 3jq the latter, their lives are in the hands of the officers.   A considerable amount of sympathy must bs felt with the officers in their present precarious situation, although they have in the past contributed to bring about the condition of affairs on themselves.    It is doubtful whether, since the revolution, it would have been possible for them to have improved their position, but the fact remains that the majority of the young officers have not attempted to do so.   They have never taken any interest in the welfare of their men and can hardly be expected to make a start now.    They know little about their ships, and their one idea seems to be to get through their duties, watohkeeping or whatever they may be, with as little trouble to themselves as possible.    In these circumstances it is not surprising that there is little sympathy between the quarter and the lower decks.   The flaptains and officers have practically no authority, all this is vested in the ship&apos;b committee, which decides whether any order is to be carried out or not$    Practically anything that they do not wish to do, such as scrubbing decks etc. is called 1 old regime4, and as such is vetoed.      I will not dwell upon the disgraceful affair of the murder of the four officers of the BPSTR0PAVL0VSKB, but it is typical of the general state of things that it should be possible for the men to interrogate their officers throughout the fleet as to whether they sided with Korniloff or Kerenski.    A Russian officer assured me that on board one of the battleships a bluejacket was told S!f.w?  it.111 th? ward-room all day, to report the conversation of the officers to the ship^ committee.  I have reliable in-formation that a large number of officers of the navy nave every intention of * escaping&quot; from it this winter; several have already done sot as they realise that their position isintolerable/.
^rrfnienable,    One officer from the Black Sea Fleet has already t     tedM with a view to his Joining some other service, Ind I have an idea that he tos acting more or less for other officers in that fleet.3 -    Aoart from the all-important question of discipline, the hie ships of the fleet are in poor trim to meet an enemy. They spend nearly all their time at Helsingfors, very seldom go to sea, and hardly ever oarry out any exercises.    The Minister of Uarine (Admiral Vederevsky) assured me that they had done their gunnery praotioes, hut I have good evidence that these were carried out ,at short range, and were of a very perfunctory nature.4.-    The Black Sea Fleet has never exercised as such for two years, no exercises &quot;by day or night are carried out and, though the discipline appears to be somewhat better than in the Baltic Fleet, it would hardly be considered as worthy of the name of discipline as understood by us-.5%-    Reverting to the Baltic Fleet, several Russian officers have not disguisea the fact from ma that they do not think that the big ships would put up any sort of a fight against the enemy, and though perhaps.), in the present state of affairs, they may be naturally&apos; pessimistic, as to their service, I do not think that there is much exaggeration in this state-^nt, and to a well disciplined and resolute enemy they are hardly to be regarded as a serious fighting foroe.   The destroyers and submarines are in better fighting trim, largely from the fact that they spend more time at sea, although there was a case not long ago of the crew of a submarine not allowing the Captain to attack a seaplane which was pn the water.     The English submarines are constantly having to take the place of the Russian boats which. habit0n^n^L?H^ put*it     *?,suite recently, have developed a weeF  ?wnb^^ fe? 2OT.tw8nky outside their base.   This7,      The new Minister of Marine, Admiral Vederevski, in an interview I had with him two days ago, appeared to be quite alive to the seriousness of the situation, but informed me that no direct order to any ship had been recently disobeyed.   A high official of the Naval General Staff, however, rather discounted this by telling me that they were very oareful as to what orders were given, S0 that they should not risk direct refusal, and with tills view the Admiralty exercise very little authority over the movement of ships etc., which is vested entirely in the hanis of the Coimfonder-in-Chief, who is regarded as a better ^udge of what orders stand a reasonable chance of being carried out.8*-    The foregoing is a general statement of what I believe to be the condition or affairs in the Russian Navy at the present /moment,   it is possible that some amelioration mn,y take place from the meetings of the Democratic Congress &quot;vftiion are now being held, but I am very doubtful on that point.   The trouble is too
deep-seated to be easily eradicated, and the fact that every sailor has constituted himself a politician adds to the many difficulties which attend the restoration of discipline.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   VICTOR STANLEY.    .Rear Admiral.-British Naval Liaison Officerin Russia.
TELEGRAM FROM REAR-ADMIRAL STANLEY&quot;   to  ADMIRALTY.SITUATION IN THE BALTIC,From   -    Stanley^ Petrcgrad Tc      -   Admiralty,   21/11/17.I do not consider there is mere than barest possibility of Russian Fleet or part of it be ins: delivered tc Germans treacherously.    Practically all newer over Fleet now vested in Baltic Fleet Committee and I think there are sufficient right minded men to prevent such an act.  What appears to me more likely (will be ?) handing ever of fcur dreadnoughts might be made one of preliminary conditions of peace and this would be difficult tc prevent.    With regard to submarines copy of emergency orders for them was forwarded to Admiralty 10th November my submission 34.*     It will be seen that my order namely C boats to be destroyed E boats tc endeavour tc get cut of Baltic and failing that to intern in Sweden is compromised between two alternative suggestions.   I held to that opinion considering chance cf E boats getting out cf Baltic outweighs chance of Sweden ,icining the enemy and in any case only four boats are eoncorned.* Not yet received at Admiralty.MOST    SECRET.
