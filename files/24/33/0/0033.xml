Colonel hm      9[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] 0166Printed for the War Cabinet.  November 1917.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 26. Week ended Ylih November.NAVAL OPERATIONS.On November 17th during a reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight our light cruisers North Sea. sighted three groups of enemy vessels steering to North-Westward. The first group consisted of ten minesweeping vessels and destroyers, followed by a second group consisting of five to eight craft resembling submarines, three of which appeared to be very large and to have funnels. This force was followed by a third group consisting of at least four light cruisers and a number of destroyers.Fire was opened immediately and one vessel of the first group, a minesweeper, was sunk before the group disappeared to the North-East in a smoke screen.A lucky shot caused a heavy explosion in and apparently destroyed a vessel of the second group, whereupon the other vessels of this group disappeared.The third group turned to the South-east, pursued by the First Light Cruiser Squadron, the Sixth Light Cruiser Squadron and the First Cruiser Squadron, a running engagement taking place under a heavy smoke screen until within 30 miles of Heligoland, when four enemy battleships were sighted ahead and opened fire, hitting the &quot; Caledon &quot; aft with a heavy shell.One enemy cruiser was seen to be heavily on fire, a second was badly damaged and reduced in speed, and a violent explosion was caused in a third by the last salvo from the battle cruise: &quot; Repulse,&quot; which had followed up our light cruisers.The damage to our ships was superficial except in the &quot; Caledon &quot; which was hit twice; &quot; Calypso&quot; also was hit twice, and &quot; Cardiff &quot; about five times. All the ships engaged are ready for service, except &quot;Caledon.&quot; Our total casualties were 1 officer and 21 men killed, and 4 officers and 39 men wounded.   We picked up 22 prisoners.The laying of deep minefields off the south-west coast of England has been continued. CharjnelT&quot;&apos;&quot;R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aero- ;pian(3ersdromes at Vlisseghem, Houttave and Handzaeme, about 3  tons of bombs having been N.E.dropped.   In aerial fighting during the week 4 enemy machines have been destroyed and Prance5 driven down completely out of control. (r.n.a.S.During the two weeks ended 3rd November, R.N.A.S. squadrons Nos. 1, 8 and operatlol&amp; 10 attached to the R.F.C. in France, have destroyed  7 enemy machines,, driven down 4 out of control, attacked numerous ground targets with machine-gun fire from low altitudes, and successfully driven off enemy artillery spotting machines.   Two of our machines failed to return.Mines have been laid off the Belgian Coast.(c 776)  55   11/17  H&amp;S^Minelaying.^
Mediter- The destroyer &quot; Staunch &quot; and monitor &quot; 31.15 &quot; have been torpedoed and sunk by anranean.      enemy submarine oft&apos; Deir el Belah (about 9 miles south of Gaza).   There are 7 men missing from &quot; Staunch &quot; and one has died from injuries, and 26 men are missing from &quot; M.15.&quot;R.N.A.S. machines have unsuccessfully bombed Luleburgas Bridge (about 40 miles E.S.E. of Adrianople), have dropped incendiary bombs on stacks of fodder at Alaplie Station (10 miles west of Luleburgas) causing a large fire, and attacked with bombs and machine-guns, trains on the Adrianople-Constantinople Railway.Mavro Island (5 miles north of Tenedos) has been bombed by enemy aircraft and shelled by shore guns, but no damage was (lone and there were no casualties.Casualties.        The armed trawler &quot; Thuringia &quot; was mined or torpedoed oft the south coast of Ireland, and there were no survivors.The armed drifter &quot; John Mitchell &quot; has been sunk by collision with a steamer, the whole of the crew being saved.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review !) to ]6 large enemy submarines have been located, of which probably 7 have been operating to the west of the British Islands, one in the Arctic Sea. and one. the &quot; submarine cruiser.&apos;1 between Madeira and the Azores, working northward on the loth inst. There has also been considerable activity oft the Yorkshire Coast, and in the English Channel where at one time as many as 0 boats are believed to have been working.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homesubmarined ^a^ers during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have been engaged, and also the number of submarines destroyed by mine : 	Week	ended	Week	ended	Week	ended	Week	ended	October 28th.

This one, added to the two at (A) and live two at [B), makes up the jive mentioned by the Prime Minister in his speech in tJie House of Commons, as liaving been destroyed in 24 hours from Saturday [11 th) to Sunday (18th).Eric Geddes.

It will be observed that vessels lost, the attacks this week are practically confined to Home Waters and the Mediterranean, enemy activity in the Atlantic having been very slight. One vessel was sunk by mine in the Arabian Sea.ENEMY MINES.Minelaying activity of the enemy has this week been experienced in the Harwich and Minelaying. Dover areas and off the South Coast of Ireland, the activity in the Lowestoft and Harwich areas having been very marked. From the number of mines swept up it appears that at least three submarine minelayers have operated in the vicinity of the channels to Harwich, which locality is more persistently mined than any other portion of the coast, the enemy&apos;s operations doubtless being directed against the Harwich Force. It is interesting to note, however, that no mines have been found in the Nore area since the 24th of September, a possible explanation of this fact being that the submarine or sub-marines whose particular duty it was to mine within this area have been sunk, as it is known that each submarine commander is a specialist for a certain area.(c 776* A 2

During the week 794 ships have been convoyed as compared with 735 last week.Of the 794 ships convoyed. 451 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and 109 on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber route, the remaining 174 being engaged on overseas trade. 79 inward and 95 outward. There are no losses in convoy this week, and convoys in Home Waters have been immune from attack.*Defensive During the week 17 Merchant vessels have been fitted to take defensive armament,armament.  There is a net addition during the week of 34 guns, and the number now available amounts to 3,131.Offensive The number of Howitzers and Bomb-throwers delivered during the week is 19, makingarmament,  the total delivered to date 281.Mine ro During the week 49 Merchant Ships have been fitted with Otter equipment, bringingtectkingear. t,ne total number so fitted up to 806.The number of Warships now fitted with Paravanes is 299.Dazzle A further 40 ships have been dazzle painted, making a total of 285 vessels, and 230Painting.    additional voyages have been made during the week without loss from submarine attack.DEVELOPMENT OF KITE BALLOONS.The kite balloon work carried out by ships of the Grand Fleet between March and November of this year shows a great technical advance, especially in the naval application of captive balloons for observation work.The most interesting experiments have been with a balloon towed by a &quot; K &quot; Class Submarine. These show that this class of submarine is quite capable, both on the surface and when submerged, of towing balloons and probably airships under ordinary weather conditions, and that the towing while submerged does not inconvenience either the submarine or the balloon.Experiments in towing in high winds have also been satisfactory, a balloon with observers in it having been towed for 30 minutes in an 83-knot gale. A balloon was towed for six days in succession without being hauled down.The Kite Balloon Destroyer Force for anti-submarine operations was often at sea during the summer doing very good work, and on one occasion a submarine, sighted from a kite balloon at a distance of about 28 miles, was chased and probably sunk.Generally speaking, kite balloons are developing into a very useful arm for anti-submarine and fleet scouting work.
MOVEMENTS OF ENEMY SHIPS.Two enemy Merchant Ships have this week arrived at, and one has sailed from, merchant-Xorwegian ports (outside the Cattegat).   None have arrived at or left Rotterdam. men*FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Russia.The discipline of the Baltic Fleet is reported to be very bad. All officers&apos; leave has been stopped ; they are to all intents and purposes under open arrest, and the Commander-in-Chief is anxious for their safety. Two cruisers and four destroyers, with crews who side with the Extremist Party, are at Petrograd. Admiral Verderevski, Minister of Marine, was arrested, but released shortly afterwards.The Black Sea Fleet is apparently acting in sympathy with the Baltic Fleet.Italy.In view of the certainty of enemy attacks on the east coast, the Italian Ministry of Marine are taking steps to increase the output of mines by every possible means, and 2,000 British mines and one or two minelayers are to be placed at their disposal for thispurpose.The British Monitor, H.M.S. &quot; Earl of Peterborough,&quot; arrived at Venice on November 17th in readiness for bombarding the enemy if he crosses the Piave.Naval Staff,22nd November, 1917.[Appendices.
