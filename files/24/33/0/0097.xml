(This Document is the Property of^His Britannic (V5ajesty&apos;s Government.)BOARD OF TRADE,7, WHITEHALL GARDENS,LONDON, S.W.Oolc:-el Jones 39/AFINANCIAL POSITION OF THE RAILWAY COMPANIES.With reference tc War Cabinet 275, Minute 16, I circulate a Memorandum prepared in tho Board of Trade stating the financial position under the agreement with the Railway Companies.A.H.3.28.11.17.
THE FINANCIAL POSITION UNDER THIi 2G3&amp;K&amp;ft WITHTHL RAILWAY COMPANIES.MEMORANDUM BY rm BOARD OF TRAH.A. BRITISH RAILWAYS.(1) East Results,The general principle of the Railway Agreement isthat the Government should pay the railway companiessuch sums as will make up their net receipts to thelevel attained in 1913.    This general principle is,however, modified to the extent that a smsll proportionof the increased wages paid to the traffic employeesis borne by the companies themselves..    Under thisAgreement the sums payable- by the Government to theBritish Railway Companies from the outbreak of war tothe end of June 1917 arc as follows5th August to 31st Dedember 1914      6,758,554Year 1915.........................  9,220,784Year 1916......................... 12,707,482Half-year to 30th June 1917 ,...... 10,024,407 39^311^227It should be noted that the above mentioned amounts arc partly estimated, and that a considerable addition in rospect of arrears of maintenance and repairs will become due after the period of control if prices of materials should continue to rule high.    On the basis of present prices the amount thus due in respect of the arrears which have accrued up to the present time would probably exceed  5,000.1000.
The amounts paid to the railways under the agreement cover the performance by the companies of a large and increas-ing number of services by the companies for which no direct payments have been made.    From the beginning of the war no charge has been made for the conveyance of naval and military officers and men under warrant and the conveyance of stores and naval and military traffic in general,   This arrange-ment was extended later to traffic belonging to the Ministry of Munitions.   From August 1917 the goods traffic of all the. principal Government Departments in Great Britain and Ireland has similarly&apos;be en conveyed free.    Many steam vessels belonging to railway companies have been used by the Government without-charge during the war, 92 vessels being so used at the present time.   The Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions and War Office have taken over various ware-houses and other promises belonging to railway companies for which as 3 rule no rent is paid.    Other services per-fcrmed free of charge to the Government Departments concerned include such matters as dock charges, repairs to Government ships, and the supply of Gas, Water, and Electricity.One of tho objects of the agreement was to make it possib to avoid the necessity of discussing the precise value of the services performed by Railway Companies for the Government and of keeping an exact account of them.    In these circum-stances no exact statement as to their value can be made,   -but the Railway executive Committee have made the following estimates:-
Estimated value of the free services performed fcr the Government by British Railways,5th August to DeceTSoTliiU...-^..,.....  3,500,000Year 1915.............................. . 12,556,424Year 1916..........................,.... 23,061,057Half-year to 30th June, 1917............ 17,762,079. 56*879^560According to these eotimateo the value of the free services performed hy the railway companies for the Government up tf the end of June 1917 exceeded the sums payable   under the Railway Agreement &quot;by tho followingamounts :-5th August to 31st December, 1914...... 3 253,554(deficiency)Year 1915............................  3,335,640Year 1916............................ 10,353,575Half-year to 30th June, 1917.........  7,137,672 17^553^333&quot;(2)  r.e3.ent fcwLfam-If the figure of ahout  7,000,000 in six months (or  14,000,000 in a year, disregarding as unimportant at tho present tine tho fact that the second half of the railway year is normally more profitable than the first) he accepted provisionally as representing the net profit to the Exchequer during the first half of 1917 under the Railway Agreement, an approximate indication of the present position can be deduced from it by making allowance for subsequent changes.   Of these much the most important is the increased wages granted to the railway staff.    The average war bonus paid during the first half ,o  -.1917 was ahout 12/4d a waok to the adult male employees:   there is now being paid a war wage of 15/- a week.   This involves a relative increase1oj
in tho wages hill of about  6,000,000 a year, which, it will he seen , woul&apos;5. reduce to  8,000,000 the surplus at the rate of  14,000,000 a year estimated by the Railway Companies as likely to he secured by the Exchequer during 1917,   The-effect of the alterations in the price of materials which have taken place since the first half of 1917 is relatively unimportant^and. may possibly have been counter-balanced by the further economies and restrictions of    -facilities made by the Companies^of.which no numerical estimate oan he given but which, it is safe- to say^are not likely seriously to affect the general conclusion arrived at above.So far as available data go therefore it would seem that the Exchequer is at the moment gaining, as a result of the Railway Agreement, at the rate of possibly as much as  8,000,000 in a year in spite of the facts:-(1) that the employees having been granted a war wage of 15/- a week are receiving about  25,000,000 a year more than they would have received on the pre-war standard of wages and (2) that tho shareholders arc receiving practically the same dividends as before the war.If the recent award of the Committeo on Production granting an increase of 5/- a week to enginemen is applied generally to railway employees an additional expenditure of be.tffe.-n  8,000,000 and  9,000,000 will be involved, which, it will he seen, is sufficient to wipe out the existing surplus as estimated above-*
1U 8It should-perhaps be- -observed that the national exchequer may he regarded as having^eruefited to some-earterrtr at the expense of the public as a result of the increased passenger fares and the withdrawal of facilities which the Railway Companies have been obliged to enforce.    So far as can be judged these changes have not in thomselves had the effect of increasing the gross receipts of the railways to any marked extent, but they have enabled the companies to reduce their services and utilize their plant more econom-ically and have thus put into tho Government purse money which it is fair to regard as having been partly contributed by the public,B, IRISH HAIDVAY3.The Irish Railways were taken over at the beginning of 1917 on similar terms to those applicable to railways in Groat Britain.     The amount of compensation psid in respect of the half year ondod 30th June 1917 was  556,751 No estimate has been made of the value of the free services performed by the Irish Railways for the Government, but it is probably not large.    Allowing for the present war wages being paid, the compensation now being received by the Irish Railways would amount to about  1,500,000 a year, which would be increased to about  1,$30,000 a year by an increase of 5/-a week in war wages,23th November, 1917
