[This Document is the Property cf His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.G,-T. 2716.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for5 the Week ending the 21st November, 1917.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.Labour opinion on the debate on Industrial Unrest in the House of Lords is discussed.Part II: Press Opinions.The Labour press generally criticises the Prime Ministers Paris speech. The action of the Food Controller is also criticised. The closure of the Peace debate in the House of Commons is resented.Part III: District Reports.The 12! per cent, increase has everywhere caused much agitation, which is still very acute. The unrest due to food prices and shortage continues. In Yorkshire the activities of the War Aims Committee have been most successful. In Lanca-shire the Cotton crisis is serious. Tom Mann is busy in Wales, and is to be followed by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. The position on the Clyde is serious, and a War -Vims campaign seems called for.Part IV: Strikes.The serious strike a,t Cowes continues. At Belfast there is a serious strike over the 12^ per cent, award, and smaller strikes at other places.There are in addition strikes at several collieries. The total number of strikes reported by the Labour Statistics Department has increased by one to sixty-nine.Part V: Disputes.The number of disputes reported by the Shipyard Labour Department has again increased.   This is counterbalanced by a diminution in other industries.I. General Remarks. Labour Unrest and the House of Lords.The debate on the 7th November in the House of Lords, initiated by the Marquess of Salisbury, has attracted the attention of the leading Labour journals, not on account of the originality of the views expressed, but rather of the locality in which they have now been ventilated.   As the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; remarks: Some of the speeches, particularly those of the Archhishop of York and the Marquess of Salisbury, in their denunciations of social conditions, might almost have been delivered from a Socialist platform.The debate has been welcomed as an indication that the important questions which agitate labour have at last Been recognised as of first-rate importance.   The [1100-5] B
II. Press Opinions.Criticism of the Government.The Prime Minister&apos;s Paris speech forms the subject of comment in all the Labour papers. Generally they argue that Mr. Lloyd George has been a member of the Government throughout the war, and Prime Minister during the last year, that under these, circumstances, if the facts are as stated in the speech, he must accept the responsibility, and cannot transfer it to the shoulders of others. They voice the impression that a change of Government may be expected in the near future,.and revive the appeal to Labour to be ready to undertake the duties of office.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; publishes a paragraph under the heading of &quot; The Premiers Bombshell.&quot;   It says: &quot; . . . . Mr. Lloyd George may soon find it convenient to resign his present position of responsibility for one of greater freedom, in which he will tell tlie world how be could have achieved victory if he had been allowed to direct the whole world according to his plans. But he cannot relieve himself of responsibility. He has been a Minister during the whole war, and he became Prime Minister a year ago with practically the powers of a Dictator, under a promise to reorganise the conduct of the war for victory. He may say that he undertook an impossible task, but he cannot transfer his responsibility to others.&quot;views of the Lords are not accepted as being an accurate statement, either of the evils that exist or of the steps which must be taken to remedy those evils. The fact, however, remains that &quot; the debate showed a change in the way in which these representatives of the British aristocracy regard social problems.&quot;The chief criticism of the debate is found in the &quot;Herald,&quot; which, while congratulating the House of Lords &quot; on their wisdom in grasping the fact that organised labour is determined to secure something more than increase of wages and shorter hours,&quot; points out that the ultimate objects of the Labour agitation are much wider than anything which was suggested in the debate.&quot; Those who are leading in the world of Labour are determined to secure complete partnership and control of industry, and also to secure that the basis of all industry shall be social service and not the pursuit of rent, profit, and interest.&quot;What is required, in the opinion of that journal, is a complete change of spirit. The writer of the article, however, has overlooked the fact that this exactly represents the view clearly expressed by the Archbishop of York.&quot; What matters is not a new scheme, but a new spirit. It is not difficult to know what that spirit must be. It is the spirit which the war has most wonderfully elicited the spirit by which the master motive of industry will not be either the making of profits or the earning of wages, but the service of the community.&quot;It cannot be questioned that there are signs of an improvement in the spirit of industry at the present time. The ballot in South Wales has demonstrated a solid patriotic majority in that part of the country which has always been regarded with anxiety as the headquarters of the &quot; revolutionary &quot; movement. In Woolwich and in Barrow the activities of the extremist shop stewards have responded at once to the call for service made upon them by the Food Controller. Enquiries as to possible application of the principles of the Whitley Report are establishing the existence of a mutually sympathetic spirit between employers and employed in many quarters. It may probably be accepted as certain that the investigations of the Industrial Unrest Commissions, coupled with the proposals of the Whitley Committee, have convinced the sober members of the working classes that their interests are a serious concern of the Government, and this impression has doubtless been unexpectedly reinforced by the debate in the Lords.The position appears to have improved, but there are still a number of questions which give rise to anxiety. Of these the three immediately most important are the food question, which Labour would solve by rationing, the 12^ per cent, increase, and the housing question. In addition there is the case of the profiteer, who is generally, though possibly erroneously, believed to be responsible for the food difficulty. The acceptance of the suggestion of Lord St. Davids that the excess profits tax should be raised to 100 per cent, would unquestionably receive the unani-mous suport of the working classes.
The &quot;Herald&quot; quotes the outspoken denunciation of the Prime Minister and all his works &quot; from the &quot;Globe,&quot; and continues: &quot; We are not in this wretched squabble. Mr. Lloyd George will be judged both by the verdict of his own time and posterity. . . . We send out a call to the common people. Labour of all sides must rally to the rescue of mankind. We must seize the present moment to reorganise and solidify the great Labour movement and ourselves save ourselves. The old system, the old men, the old policies have all hopelessly broken down. It is for Labour in all lands to buckle on its armour and go forth.   .   .   .&quot;&quot;Justice &quot; shortly analyses the salient points of the speech, with appropriatecriticism, and concludes as follows: &quot; As things are, the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive of the Labour Party might do worse than prepare for startling political eventuali-ties. And the Labour members in the Ministry might again consider whether they would not play a far more important role if they sought to take control of affairs rather than rest content with accepting office. A little &apos; bolshevik &apos; audacity would not be altogether a dis-advantage to leaven the lump of judicial caution.The &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; follows the same lines as the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; while the &quot; Merthyr Pioneer,&quot; like the &quot; Herald,&quot; quotes the &quot; Globe,&quot; and comments: &quot; How to escape the consequences of his monstrous and disastrous leadership and retain his political reputation is now his chief concern. Personally, I should not be surprised if he and his fellow political gambler, Mr. Churchill, formed a political partnership, and, as is the custom of rats, left the sinking ship of the Government to avoid going down with the wreckage.&quot;The same paper at another.place prints a venomous and scurrilous attack on the Government under the title &quot; The Enemies of the People,&quot; in which it demands that, the failure of the Government having been admitted by the Premier, the professional politicians shall make way for the representatives of the opinions of the people.Government Control: Food.The publication of the authorised scale for voluntary rationing has given rise to comment in all the Labour papers, the scheme being welcomed by some and con-demned by others. Of the former class the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; prints a long article on &quot; The New Food Rations,&quot; in which it explains and commends the schedule.   The article concludes: We believe that the workers will loyally observe the new scale for voluntary rationing. .   But if their sacrifices are not to be in vain, the authorities must take every step they can and exercise every power they possess to make the hoarding of food impossible among those classes who can afford it.   That is essential to the effective working of the scheme.   It is essential if compulsory rationing is to be avoided.&quot;&quot; Clarion &quot; writes: &quot; The scheme is almost certain to prove a failure, but no patriotic person will for that reason ignore the appeal. Keep to the rations, or below them, and whatever happens your conscience will be clear.&quot;The &quot;Leicester Pioneer &quot; calls upon its readers to join Sir Arthur Yapp&apos;s League of National Safety. &quot; Justice &quot; pours ridicule on that League and on Sir Arthur Yapp&apos;s methods generally, which it describes as treating the people of these islands like a lot of school children.The &quot; Herald &quot; is typical of those papers which see in the scheme a device to enable the rich to escape their share of the burden by submitting to voluntary rations of certain articles, knowing that they can eke these out by means of luxuries which are outside the financial range of the poor. It demands communal kitchens and compulsory rations for all.Government Control: Cotton.Referring to the restrictions in the import of raw material the &quot; Cotton Factory limes &quot; considers that the outlook for the cotton trade is very black indeed. It comments as follows: , - - - - Lancashire, however, has passed through many a trying period. Things nave looked black before, and even now we look forward to winning through to better times
tbefore long, if the Control Board can get the Government to see what a tremendous calamity a general stoppage of the trade would be not only for Lancashire but for the trade at large. . . . . Directly and indirectly the people in this country relying for a livelihood on the cotton trade number millions. In view of this, it is to be hoped that the Government will realise the magnitude of its responsibility in this matter.&quot;The &apos;* Manchester Guardian &quot; (21st November) reports with pleasure unexpect-edly large arrivals of cotton, which may help the situation. The Ministry of Labour are discussing with the Director of Aircraft Construction the possibility of erecting aircraft factories in Lancashire to absorb some of the unemployed operatives.The South Wales Ballot.Comment on the result of the ballot of the South Wales miners on the subject, of the comb-out is markedly restricted. The &quot; Merthyr Pioneer &quot; continues its attempts to explain the figures and justify them from the pacifist standpoint. The Herald &quot; welcomes the result on the ground that a victory for the pacifist section would have resulted in an irremediable Labour split. The Labour Leader,&quot; the &apos;* Call,&quot; the &quot;Leicester Pioneer,&quot; and other pacifist papers make no reference to the result of the ballot.Peace Agitation.Mr. Malcolm Sparkes has written an article on Labour and Peace, which is published in this week&apos;s &quot; Herald.&quot; In an introductory note, Mr. Sparkes is erroneously described as the author of the Whitley Report.&quot; The article suggests that British Labour, supported at the earliest possible moment by an International Labour Conference, shall propose the immediate cessation of hostilities, an Inter-national Congress of constructive goodwill, and a neutral council to act as an advisory body, and, if necessary, as a judicial authority for investigation of breaches of international law. In the &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; Mr. Lowes Dickinson presses for the formation of a League of Nations to prevent war in the future.The peace debate in the House of Commons is a subject of comment in some I.L.P. journals. The application of the closure was evidently resented. As to this the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; writes: &quot; The closuring of the debate last week was a confession of the weakness of the position of the Government in diplomacy. The case is admittedly a bad one when its supporters have to resort to hooliganism to prevent a criticism of it. No peace of a lasting character can ever be made by our present Ministers. They have not the wisdom or intelligence !&apos; ir such a task.&quot;&quot;Forward&quot; has the following on the same subject: &quot; . . . . It was known that we had strong reserves. So the acute ones joined with the &apos; hunger and sociability &apos; ones and shouted &apos; Divide! Divide!&apos; Thus the (lebate came to an end.&quot;III. District Reports.London.The 12-],- per cent, advance continues to be the chief cause of unrest in this area, though strikes have not so far occurred. A mass meeting of all the men interested in the Chatham dockyard was held on the 14th, but it was decided not to take action at present.   The men expect that the Admiralty will grant the desired concession.At Woolwich, the skilled men support the extension of the advance to unskilled men, while the men in the gauge shop are still grumbling at the inadequacy of the rise. Six of the most highly skilled men on this very important work have left during the past three weeks.Unrest among the aircraft workers has diminished, but the situation is still far from reassuring. Engineers employed at aeroplane-engine works are demanding to be included in the 12^ per cent, advance, and at least one strike has occurred.South-East.This area continues to be somewhat restless, and the position in the Isle of Wight is still serious. The situation on the Bristol Channel, where numerous applications for advances in wages are being made is also somewhat disturbing.
West Midlands.The agitation in regard to food prices in this district is becoming very serious. This is particularly the case at Coventry, where on Saturday, the one-day protest strike which had been advertised for some weeks, was duly carried out. It is understood that Mr. dynes, M.P., of the Ministry of Food, is dealing personally with the question, and it is hoped that the situation will shortly improve.There is considerable jealousy of the unskilled workers&apos; organisations on the part of skilled men at Coventry. Owing to the enormous increase in the industry of that town, the skilled workers are in a minority, and feel their position keenly.At Birmingham, there is discontent due to the absence of adequate travelling facilities.At various works in the West Midlands district there has been a considerable distribution of pacifist literature, and this has been effected with such secrecy that those responsible have succeeded in evading observation.Yorkshire and East Midlands.With the exception of the agitation over the 12^ per cent, advance the situation in this district continues to be calm. There is no evidence of acute discontent, and the Governments action in regard to the recommendations of the Whitley Committee has been very well received.The efforts of the War Aims Committee have met with uniform success, and as a consequence the activities of the various pacifist bodies have conspicuously failed. The important meeting held at Leeds some weeks ago, at which Mr. Asquith made a speech, is reported to have had a particularly good effect.The position at Sheffield continues to be acute. The skilled men have refused to support the demand which has been advanced by the unskilled, viz., that they should be included in the 12^ per cent, advance. It is not probable, however, that either side will take action until after a definite announcement of the Governments policy is made.Leicester has been the scene of an important conference of the N.U.R., at which a far-reaching statement as to the policy of reconstruction which the Union intends to adopt after the war was made by Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. In the course of his speech he advised his hearers not to make use of strikes during the continuance of the war.Boot and shoe workers at Northampton are reported to be very discontented with the high food prices. These are also said to be an important subsidiary cause of the unrest at Sheffield.North- Western.The situation produced in this district by the 12^ per cent, advance has grown worse during the last week. This is particularly the case among the engineers and allied workers; the number of men who have ceased work on account of this question is becoming considerable.The cotton industry is passing through the most severe crisis that has been experienced since the American Civil War, and the recent proposal still further to cut down the supply of raw material has caused much alarm and heart-burning throughout Lancashire. The decision seems to have come as a surprise, most people having expected that supplies were to be increased.In addition to this, the decision of the Control Board not to make any further grants in relief of unemployment after the 10th December, will mean an additional strain on the Unions, which are expected to petition the Government for a grant to help&apos; them over their difficulties.There has for some time past been unrest among boatmen and other riverside workers on the Mersey. At Manchester this has recently come to a head in an important strike, and there is a possibility of the trouble spreading.The Manchester Shop Stewards appear to have broken with W. F. Watson&apos;s movement, of which they have hitherto been the chief supporters, and have expressed the intention of opposing him at the next conference of the Engineering and Ship-building trades.At Barrow the shop stewards are still chiefly occupied with the food question, but the lack of travelling facilities remains one of the most important causes of local unrest, little or no improvement having been effected.[1100-5] C
Northern.The 12^ per cent, award continues to be the most important cause of discontent in this district. The trouble is particularly acute among the smiths and strikers who are members of the same unions. The smiths have received the advance, but the strikers, whose work is less skilled, have not. It is feared that unless the out-come of the negotiations which are now proceeding is satisfactory both grades will clown tools. The position is rather similar with the A.S.E. and the Machinists&apos; Union.In some parts of the Durham coalfield there is reported to be extreme poverty owing to the short time worked in the local collieries.Wales.Apart from trouble in several of the collieries the situation in South Wales is quieter.A meeting, representative of 50,000 workmen, last week passed a resolution in favour of immediate and compulsory rationing of food.During the past week Tom Mann has been engaged on revolutionary propaganda in the mining districts. His speeches were, however, of an industrial, rather than a pacifist character. A visit from Mr. Ramsay MacDonald is expected shortly, and he is said to intend addressing most of his meetings in private, presumably to avoid disorder and rioting.Scotland.The position on the Clyde has grown decidedly worse. A number of more or less important strikes have been, or are still, in progress, notably one among women workers at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s (see Section IV). In connection with this strike, the men in a number of shops have resolved to come out in sympathy, unless the women&apos;s demands are met, and it is even suggested that a general stoppage through-out the West of Scotland might result,The Clyde workers&apos; Committee is giving its support to the Women&apos;s Peace Crusade, and has now, apparently, thrown in its lot with the pacifist bodies; while the Glasgow Trades Council on receipt of the Prime Ministers Paris speech immediately passed a resolution, calling on the Labour Party to summon an inter-national conference of workers &quot; for the purpose of determining a speedy termina-tion of the war.&quot; It is suggested that the War Aims Committee should direct its attention to the Glasgow area, in which counter-propaganda seems urgently necessary.IV. Strikes.The strike at Cowes which was caused by the excessive price of coal in the Isle of Wight still continues.The difficulty is being dealt with by tiie Coal Controller, though the main problem would appear to be lack of barges for transport purposes; efforts to obtain these are being made. Meanwhile some 6,000-7,01)0 men, many of them engaged on very important work, remain idle.The number of strikes which have occurred in the shipbuilding industry during the past week is ten. The most important of these involves between 4,000 and 5,000 engineers, turners, machinemen, &amp;c, in the employment of several large firms at Belfast.This stoppage arose out of the .12A per cent, advance, as was anticipated in last week&apos;s district report. Although the men have been informed that the matter is occupying the attention of the Government, they have so far refused to return to work.Five of the ten cases of stoppage have occurred in the Clyde, and two of these are reported to have been due to the application of the 12  per cent, advance. Of the remainder, two were due to demarcation troubles between shipwrights and joiners, a never-ending cause of strikes and disputes.
The award is also the cause of certain of the strikes reported by the Ministry of Munitions.In one case at Derby the men, after being out for over a week, have temporarily resumed work in anticipation of a decision by the Government. In the East Lancashire district several strikes are in progress. At Burnley practically all the men engaged in engineering work are idle, both skilled and unskilled. The former have received the advance, but decided to come out in sympathy with the latter. The last report received states that the engineers at Colne, Nelson, and Padiham struck work on Monday, so that the situation is rapidly getting more serious.The dispute at Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, East Hope Street, Glasgow, which arose out of the dismissal of several women for restricting their output, and was referred to in last week&apos;s report, has now led to a strike of some 400 women employed by that firm.The strike is unofficial. The district committee of the A.S.E. has given instruc-tions that no tools are to be set up for those women who have refused to strike, and the strikers are receiving much sympathy from the other works in the district, several of which have expressed the intention of striking to support them.The number of strikes reported as having been in progress in the coalmining industry during the past week is ten: four of these are new cases, but in six of the total work has since been resumed.The stoppage at the Sutton Colliery in Nottinghamshire over the non-unionist question continues: it involves 1,000 men. At Blaenavon, in South Wales, 4,500 furnacemen, munition workers, and others came out on strike on the 14th, in consequence of an insult alleged to have been offered to a female employee by a manager. The men have returned to work, on receiving an undertaking from the Ministry of Munitions that the grievance shall be investigated within six days. The large number of men involved was due to the closing down of the collieries owing to the stoppage of electrical and steam power which resulted from the strike.At Manchester about 1,000 boatmen, porters, and others employed on the Ship Canal, struck work on Saturday.The men&apos;s union put in an application for the conversion of a war bonus of los. per week to wages and the addition of a further 5s. on behalf of employees in the Ship Canal, the Rochdale Canal, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal about a month ago. It was under-stood that this was being dealt with by the Canal Control Committee of the Board of Trade, but no decision was given. The real cause of the trouble is the fact that the carters, who are engaged on similar work, have received more favourable treatment than the strikers, and the delay in answering their application has simply brought matters to a head. The Canal Company has now offered to convert the war bonus into wages as from the 1st December, but the men remain on strike, demanding that the concession shall be retrospective from August last. The men on the Rochdale and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal remain at work, but there has been a strike of men employed in the Bridgewater Canal, also over a question of wages.V. Disputes.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 200 cases of dispute as having been jn progress during the past week; of these 49 have been settled.Neither on the Clyde nor at Aberdeen has any settlement been reached in the disputeas to rivetters&apos; rates.    The men at Aberdeen have been persuaded to continue at work andto accept the Clyde scale as a basis when it is fixed.   This makes it all the more importantthat there should be no further delay on the Clyde;.   It is understood that an attempt isbeing made to settle the question on national lines, and this is no doubt the cause of the delay.In regard to the plumbers in the Clyde area, negotiations have taken place between the Employers&apos; Federation and the Plumbers&apos; Executive in London, and it is hoped that the difficulty will be speedily arranged.The Coal Controller reports eight cases of dispute not involving a stoppage, one of which has been settled.In South Wales a dispute has arisen at the Ammanford Colliery on account of summonses which have been issued against men who recently went on strike without notice. The men are very angry, and threaten to bring out the whole district. Negotiations are proceeding, and the summonses have meanwhile been suspended for a fortnight.
Men in three collieries at Pontypridd and at the Glamorgan Colliery, Llwynypia, have also been summoned for similar offences, and in these cases also strikes are threatened.The trouble will be watched with great interest in South Wales, as, if the men obtain their ends, the law will remain a dead letter for the remainder of the war.The settlement reached between the miners and the South Wales colliery examiners and firemen has been submitted to the local lodges.The War Office Contracts Department reports four cases of dispute, one of which led to a stoppage.One of the cases arises out of the recent settlement with the Birmingham Sheet Metal Workers&apos; Association, some of the firms concerned having temporarily withheld payment. Notices affecting between 2,000 and 3,000 men and women have been handed in.The cutlery trade continues to be somewhat restless, and in the edge-tool trade, where time work is the custom, the men are demanding that the 12i per cent, advance should be applied to them. They are also expected to claim the 5s. award recently issued by the Committee on Production.The Ministry of Munitions this week reports eleven cases of dispute, one of which has already been settled.The most fruitful cause of dispute at the moment is, of course, the 12^ per cent, advance, five of the cases still in progress having originated in it.Other cases have arisen out of dilution. At the Anderson Grice Co., Carnoustie, the members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers are objecting vigorously to women being taught tool-setting.Two cases of alleged victimisation are reported, and in one of them the allegation appears to have been partly substantiated. In this latter case (at Messrs. Ardol, Selhy), the firm&apos;s continued refusal to reinstate the man who was dismissed may cause a strike of some 1,300 men.The Committee on Production heard 32 cases during the last week, 19 in London and 13 in Scotland.In addition, the very important case of the Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen was completed after an all day hearing. The award of five shillings on similar lines to that in the engineering industry has been issued.D. I. SHACKLETON.o
