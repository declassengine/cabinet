[THTg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS. BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)JS C R E T. I.T.2705.WAR     CABINET.SUPPLY   OF   COAL   TO   ITALY.Copy of letter from Sir E.Wyidbore Smith to Secretary, War Cabinet;Commission Internationale Do Ravitaillemont, India House,ICIngsway, W.C .2*21st November, 1917.Dear Hankey,The question of the supply of coal to Italy still continues to be so serious that I think it should again be brought to the notice of the War Cabinet.It will be remembered that at the Meeting of the War Cabinet, held on the 12th October, (War Cabinet 248, Minute 10), it was decided that the Italian Government should be advised to appeal to the United States Government for assistance, and that H.M.Ambassador at Washington should be instructed to support the Italian appeal.     This was done, and on the 31st October Sir C.Spring Rice reported that the United States Shipping Board had decided to allocate a number of ships to Italian service *     It would appear however that the dread of famine has decided the Italian Government to employ these vessels for the transport of cereals from the United States to Italy, a certain proportion of them returning to the United Kingdom.with Spanish ore on their way back to the United States for further cargoes of cereals.     Consequently the coal situation will be eased only in so far as a certain quantity of coal will be supplied from the United Kingdom in compensation for the loss of time incurred by those vessels which bring ore to the United Kingdom instead of returning direct to the United States.During the first nine months of this year, Italy has received only 51$ of her minimum coal requirements. During October 462,000 tons, or 54$ of hor requirements, reached Italy; this total includes 30,000 tons from the United States.The shipments from the United Kingdom during October, which roughly represent the November arrivals in Italy, amounted to 520,546 tonsj of this quantity, however, 45,197 tons have already been reported as sunk, So that, If no further sinkings occur, only 475*349 tons, or 69$ of her needs, will reach Italy during the current month from this country. No informa-tion Is available here as to the quantity shipped from the United States to Italy during October, but it is considered unlikely that it amounted to more than the quantity shipped during the previous month, vi2.j 30,000 tons*Owing
Owing to the decision taken by the Italian Government, towards the end of last month to divert frcs the coal to the wheat service a large quantity of tonnage, the shipments of coal from this country during the current month- will show a large decrease.In fact the shipments during the period November 1st to 20th amounted to only 146,753 tons of which 71,291 tons were carried in vessels u-ider Italian control.    The quantity which it is estimated will be shipped during the last ten days of this month is 210,000 tons, which will give a totetS of not more than 356.7J53 tens for the month, or 52fc of the minimum requirements, :ri thout talcing into amount cargoes, which may be lose through enemy action.After consultation v/ith the Shipping Controller I explained the situation on the 14th instant to Mr. Colby, the r epr es ant at ive of the American Shipping Board with Colonel House&apos;s Mission.    He undertook to cable the   facts to Washington and to ask for information as to the exact quantity of American -connage which could be placed at the disposal of the Italian Government, with particulars as to the position and dates at. which they would become available,.   I have, however, not heard that he has received the information asked for.*n. the meantime Baron Mayor des Planches is daily receiving from Rome the most urgent appeals for immediate help, and I would urge that   from a military as well as a political point of view it is of ihifiit&amp;st importance that drastic measures be taken in order to meet this grave situation.I fully realise that until the review of the Allies&apos; tonnage position which is now taking place has been completed it is exceedingly difficult to decide from what source any additional tonnage can be obtained.    I would, however, suggest for the consideration of the War Cabinet that in view of the fact that the supplies of coal from this country to France during the period 1st January to 10th November amounted to 71$ of their stated requirements of imported coal, while upon the other hand according to a statement made in the Chamber in July last by. Monsieur Loucheur, Minister of Munitions, their domestic   production had increased from 1,550,000 tone a month in 1916 to 2,000,000 tons in April 1917,  and was expected to increase still further in the near future, the situation should be laid before the French Government with an intimation that H.M. Government consider that it is necessary, in order to partially remedy the situation in Italy, to withdraw at any rate temporarily a certain number of British vessels at present in the French Coal Service and devote them to the transport of coal to Italy.Yours, sincerely, (Sgd)        S. Wyldbore Smith.
