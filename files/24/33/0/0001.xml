(This Document is the Property of n      /0   L - ...His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.) 5/o!DEPARII ENT Oi1 INFORMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLY    REPORT     ON     GERMANY 21 November, 1917.1.      The latest phase of the parliamentary and constitu-tional crisis has calmed down, at any rate until the Roiohstag reassembles, which, according to some accounts, will be on the 29th inst.     The general opinion is that substantial guarantees have &quot;been obtained for the influence of the Reichstag upon all decisions in home and foreign policy.    The lateBt illustration of what has been achieved is furnished by the protest of the majority parties against the reported scheme for the annexation of Russian Poland by Austria and the personal union of Oourland and Lithuania with the Prussian Crown.     Some of the main ob^ec-tions urged against this scheme from the various German points of view are:-(a) That it implies a &quot;triallsm&quot; in Austria-Hungary instead -of the present dualism and that the Germans are in doubt as to what would be the effect upon the position of the German element, which might find itself a minority of a minority in Austria proper, with, moreover, two states of the &quot;trialist&quot; monarchy altogether non-German.(b) An indispensable condition of the scheme is a closer economic union between Germany and Austria-Hungary on the lines of Neumann1 s &quot;Mittoleuropa&quot;, an arrangement which would be oen-trafy to the interests both of the German Agrarians and of the Austro-Gasfa&amp;n industrialists, and which they would strenuously oppose.(c) The Bchemo would be right in the teeth of the Reichstag resolution of July 19 and of the Reply to the PopeTs Note.   It involves &quot;annexations&quot; on a great scale and the German Social
Democrats would undoubtedly, in accordance with their recent decisions at their Wurzburg Conference, consider themselves free to vote against the war credits by way of protest.    The Allies would be fighting against a policy of spoliation and for the German Social Democrats the whole &quot;character of the war would be changed.It was doubtless these considerations that moved the German Government to issue on Novembor 9 a semi-official dementi of the alleged PoIand-Courland-iithuff.nla scheme and to announce that the preBs and the parliamentary Parties would receive itf-formation beforehand and ;&quot;an opportunity of expressing their opinion, or rather of cooperating&quot; in any projects which miglvt -be contemplated.The KfllniBohe ZeiUraff is nevertheless confident that the scheme will go through and that it will solve the Polish question and complete the work begun by the proclamations of November 5, 1916 (Austro-Gorman Declaration of Polish Indepen-dence) and September 12, 1917 (The German and Austro-Hungarian Decrees regarding the Government of Poland).    The Ktflnisohe adds:&quot;And our enemies will fat the peace negotiations) have to accept our solution of the PoliBh question as an accomplished fact.&quot;Bt     We have this week an unusual amount of information about the internal condition of Germany.    An important charao-teristic of this information is that in various points the aooountB given by one witness are confirmed by those of another. A report by a reliable informant which is transmitted from Borne gives an account of a recent journey to Friedriohshaven on Lake Constance - the site of the Zeppelin workshops - and other places in South Germany.    On the journey from tfriedrichshaven to Ravensburg, the railway carriage got a hot bearing because the axle-grease now in use is so bad.     Owing to the inferbr
quality and the lack of lubricants a great amount of rolling-stock is now of no use for running purposes.     An example of the consequences of this situation is that a train-load of argillaceous earth which ought to have reached Romanshom on the 30th of October had to be unloaded and abandoned en route.There is a terrible laok of fuel, i.e. coal and wood, in the whole of South Germany.    For this reason all agreements oonoluded between hotel-keepers and visitors for more than 14 days are annulled.     One informant tried in six botelB and could not get a room for a three weeks1 stay.    He was told in each hotel that only two or three rooms could be heated during this winter and also that the central heating is not going to be used.Ihe terrible difficulties about foodstuffs prevent the hotel-keepers from reoeiving guests.    All hotelB have re-ooived orders to give foreign visitors 14 days notice.In many cases the gas-works are threatened with totalstoppage from laok of coal.    The Raveneburg Gas-works have hadto out off the supply from the whole district, including thegarrison town of Weingarten, since November 1.     It is thoughtthat the same thing may be happening at Biberach, Ulm, Stuttgartand many other townB in South Germany.GermanWhile/politicians and the German Press oontinue to assert, probably with some foundation, that there is no desire in political circles in Bavaria to dissociate that country from the war-policy of Berlin, there is undoubtedly great local dissatisfaction in South Germany generally.     The men in training and the men back from the front eagerly desire peace and do not want to go into tho trenches again.     Corn-plaints continue, e.g. at Ilndau, where 7,000 men are quartered, that the Bavarians are always put in the tightest corner and that this has been agadn done on the Isonzo.   Every family in Lindau haB lost a relative.
There is great fear of air-raids at yriedriohshaven, and, indeed, in all Bavarian, Wtlrttemberg and Baden railway stations the illumination is reduced to what is absolutely neoes-sary, so that passengers have to descend by the light of hand-lanterns.Across the frontier, in Austria, the feeling is still moro despondent, as the health of the people has been grievously affected by bad and insufficient  food.    At Bregenz the ohil-dren and the old people are dying from hunger and cold.   Officials and workmen with whom this informant conversed lay the hiame upon the German Emperor and call down imprecations on his head.A document supplied by the American Ambassador gives a report from a well-known American dentist in Dresdent who haB recently left Germany.    He states that officers have told him about the consumption of a lot of American food products by German officers in Belgium, and also that part of the American food is sent to Germany.    The Ambassador had previously report-ed on this abuse.Goal is very scarce in Dresden and the dentist got a permit to have about 9 cwt. for three months, but he could only obtain about 5  cwt.     There is a scarcity of surgical bandages;   paper is being uBed for this purpose, and the wounded oomplain bitterly.3.      As regards health conditions, one independent report after another confirms the statements that there have been very widespread outbreaks of dysentery of a very severe oharacter. The British vioe-Oonsul at Sohaffhausen (Switzerland) reports that the health department there has placarded the frontier villages with warnings to the population against the danger of dysentery from the inhabitants on the German side.    The doctors are petitioning the federal Government for the estab-lishment of a quarantine.    The epidemio is showing itself
particularly in the Rhineland, but there was indirect testimony the other day in a lecture delivered by an authority on public health at Budapest that there had been an epidemic of dysentery in Berlin.    A nurse who had attended cases in the Rhineland reported that in the worst forms of the disease the symptoms suggest a form of cholera.At the great Congress of Socialist delegates from all Germany, held at WtLrzburg, several speakers - among them one or two women - spoke of the distress and sickness in widelyfeeparated distriots, but the reports were evidently carefully edited and it was only from veiled but significant references to these speeches in a leading article of the Socialist Yorwarts that one could infer what a distressing state of things these accounts must have revealed.4.     Some information about labour troubles has been received in connection&apos;with a report on naval mutinies.    $he events happened some time back at Kiel, but there are constant rumours that the state of things in the dockyards continues to be very unsatisfactory.    The informant, a naturalised American citizen( who was resident near Kiel till September last, spoke of strikes that had broken out at the three great shipbuilding years, Howaldt, the Imperial, and Germanla-Zropp.     Every ship in the Second and Third Squadrons promptly put out to sea and was kept there for ten days, for fear the crew should join the strikers.    Informant was present during a strike at an open-air meeting attended fcy 15,000 men;   and he frequently saw a patrol, sent out to disperse the strikers, turn down a side-street, if it saw any strikers ooming.Informant also believes that among the troops the old separatist tendencies are beginning to re-assert them-selves.    Kany tales are told of fights behind the lines between Prussians and Bavaraans, Saxons, Poles, etc.    He
heard many complaints of the quality of the new recruits.    Adrill-sergeant told him that he only got hoys of seventeen andinvalids with every sort of disease.    There were accounts ofRussian prisoners-of-war who have lost their willingness towork, and of trouble at the Hamburg Shipping Yards, where manyFrench and Belgians/ are employed.Another informant of the American ^Legation at Oopen-hagen, after giving an account of Berlin conditions, concludes:&quot;It is certain that there is at present no ohanoe of a popular uprising on the part of the lower classes and the Socialists.    On the other hand, the German Government has had the sense ; to allow a freedom of the Press unheard of prior to the war, and is permitting, as peace propaganda, much to get out in neutral papers ;-ralating to Sooialist agitation and peace propaganda in Germany&quot;.5.      Attention has lately been called to the action of some of the great German industrial companies which are increas-ing their capital in extraordinary proportions.     The most re-markable case is that of the combination of the Aniline Dye Companies, the seven largest of which are increasing their share capital from  1^,000,000 to  20,000,000.    It is true that they are buying coal mines and that they are developing the new method of extracting nitrogen from the air.    But no one believes that an increased nominal capital of  8,000,000 is required for these purposes.     Moreover, the new shares are to be iBsued at 107, while the existing shares stand at between 400 and 600.    The old shares will, doubtless, fall in conse-quenoe of the contemplated new issue, but they will not fall to an extent which will make the new issue anything else than a present to purchasers.    An ingenious explanation suggested by an expert correspondent is to the effect that the campaniee are ?**pwwr pursuing this policy in anticipation of a far-reaohing Government scheme for taxing war profits.    They are at present paying high dividends, but in proportion to the vastly increased capital, these dividends will of course undergo a
diminution. The companies would thus he enabled to avoid what they would regard as excessive taxation on their profits.Another matter which is exciting comment is the fact that the rate of mortgages demanded by $he big Mortgage Banks remains considerably below the rate of interest on Government loans and Treasury Bonds.    The inference is that first-class private security is regarded as preferable to Government security.A further symptom is that, as in Austria and Russia, so in Germany, and especially in Berlin, people who hav^\4recently made money from war profits are buying diamonds and depositing them in Dutch strong boxes.     They believe this to be a safer investment than German government bonds or bank-notes.6.      It would be a mistake to believe that the Bolshevikpeace manifesto is received with unmingXed feelings of satlsfac-tion in Germany.    The Socialist organs profess to welcome it,but the Frankfurter Zcitung finds that in the present state ofthe world, it has little praotical significance.&quot;A real proposal of peace (sic) such as was contained nearly a year ago in the notes of the Central powers and suoh as was submitted to all the belligerents a few months ago by Benedict XV. it is not.&quot;It doefe not even profess to emanate from the &quot;Russian Government&quot;but only from tho &quot;Government of the Russiwi Workmen and PoascntDIt denounces &quot;capitalists and groat lcndcd proprietors&quot; andaddresses itself to the working-classes in tho throo groatostindustrial States of Europe in laaguago which is derivod fromthe literature of Marxist propaganda.     It was not communicatedto the representatives of the Entente or the neutral Powers inPetrograd for they all decline to recognise the Bolshevik Com-mittee as a Government.    Tot the rest Its theory of the rights
of peoples, of sections of peoples and of colonies, would &quot;break up not only Russia but all existing-States into a multitude of petty, independent communities and would simply produce chaos, The Frankfurter Zeitung warns Germans against illusions about peace.     It would, indeed, be desirable that a Russian Govern-ment worthy of the name should seriously set itself to draw the right inferences from the war situation.     But &quot; so long as this does not take place, the German people must continue to strain every nerve, for the hard struggle demands day after day the utmost exertions of every individual.This warning by the frankfurter Zeitung is important as indicating the attitude of serious German Liberal opinion towards the chaos in Russia^ which cannot, if it be prolonged, serve the ulterior ohjects ;which.-Germany has in view.
