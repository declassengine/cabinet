^^l-2^5^l!!2f2ii2j^ Property ofMAINTENANCE OF THE MILITARY FORCES.\fiwaoranduja (N.S.R.33; 3.174) of the 15th November by the /5f /Sir Minister of National Service,1*     The following observations relate to the  roposals in ttoe m^oxandum which directly concern my Departmenti*(.a) With regard to the proposal that the. iunotlona of Trlbunaie should be limited to finding the facts and to granting exemptions &apos;upon the facts so fcrund in accordance with standardised rules (p.10), it is. clearly desirable that aa definite rules as possible should be issued to Tribunals; and clearer indications as to&apos; national requirements may make it possible in the, future to issue.mo,re definite rules then hag been practicable in the past, though the principle has in fact been already.applied almost to the fullest extent expedient, particularly as regards men under 31 years of age.     I should, however, deprecate any oast-iron rules which must be applied-- without disoration.    Local boiies, whiIs being&apos; adequately guided, must be, given discretion, otherwise &quot;the whole-system will be brought into disrepute.Oonditione are.too various to make.it possible to lay down rules which are to he&apos;automatically applied.     Those, who have not actually,dealt with cases have little ooncep-tion of the&apos;complexity of/Conditions and how much ,often depends on individual circumstances..     The need of. leaving discretion to the exempting&apos;;:bodies even in exceptionally clear classes of oases has been made quite manifest in the application of the List of Certified Occupations.     One reason why the Sohedule cf Protected Occupations has given, rise to so muoh dissatisfaction is because it is applied automatically, without any discretionary power.     Failure to make full use of local knowledge is not only adffiinistra-tively unwise but inevitably leads to discontent.(b) The same principle applies to oases of claims for exemption on grounds of compassion (or domestic hardship).     Experience of -the oases which coine before Tribunals make in manifest that the circusstances vary so enormously that it is not practicable to have standardised rules so that exemption Should be grantee only on asoert-uned facta without leaving discretion&quot; to the exempting bodies.     This; of course, is no reason why as olear rules as possible should not be laid down, with the essential margin of discretion.It ia important to remember, both as to claims on grounds of occupation and to olai^s on grounds of compass sion, that one inevitable consequence Of applying automati-oally any standardised rules, without disoretion to the exempting bodies, will be that men will surely be lost to the Army, beosuse oases will arise of men covered by the rules but who, on merits, should be made available for aervioe.(o) There is another important consideration.     The strain of the war is becoming progressively more severe.     It is increasingly urgent to carry public opinion in any fresh demands for men.     For this reason, any. general restrio-tion of the jpowers of Tribunals is inexpedient.     The me&amp;&amp;*ri of these bodies include large numb*n*e of the
^ p n 30 ^leaders of looal opinion)   any action whioh might   -ahow want of appreciation of the really remarkable work which they have generally done might give serioue offence which should be avoided...... ._______....... iwtw, tc get themen was earn be Tipare4 w4 %t ftf thta with the w$teX%$ ef i jpoblla epinlon*  Tr^unals have yielded the *wu    They Thave geaJarally applied msih etxOoter standards than wouldJ be po**ible to any government departments    Outside        f agriculture, the number of &quot;A* men now holding Tribunal exemptions la remarkably email,    At the same time the Tribunals remove the odium of aeleotion from the eentml^. department:.    Some lack of uniformity there is no doubtj It ie InevitsJ&amp;ie under any system?   but the essentials, the selection and yield or men with reaaoaable public support, have been secured.(d) As to the proposal that exemption on pounds of financial li&amp;rdship ehould not be permitted (p.10), while I think that on general grounds there is muoh to be a aid for this proposal, I feel that it would rat be wise nov to apply it.The su^estlon that men ehould be compensated for their loss opens alarming vlstaa of finance,    !faat kind of losses are to be compensated?    To what extent axe losses to be made good?    Xe lose of capital as well as lose of income to be repaired?    Are only immediate losses to be taken into account or are the losses whioh may ooour after the war (because, for instance, of the closing down or depredation of a business) to be taken into account?    These are sous of ths questions which would arise.It scene clear that in practloe any workable soheo&amp;e would have to follow the lines of the present arrangements with regard to civil liabilities, by which assistancs is given only in respeot of certain liabilities and only up to a definite limit (at present only up to  d a week). Many oasts would be so inadequately met that there would be grave dissatisfaction.Moreover, the introduction at this eta*e of proposals for financial compensation would Inevitably, and reasonably, bring a lar^e number of claims frcm men whs have already joined the Forces,lastly, It has to be remembered that the total number ef sen of any substantial value to the Azuy who art exempted on grounds of financial hardship is relatively email;   and It does not seer, that any special measures which, would raise large questions and may involve heavy finaa-oial responsibilities would give good value in return,X concur with ths proposal for the abolition of the periods of grace of two months and two weeks (p*8), and with the suggestion that power should be taken to oancel Occupational exemptions (p. 10);   subject, as regards the latter, tc proper provision for reserving a right to fresh claim in oasea where this &amp;&amp;y be in ths national interest,(f) As to the registration proposals, it can be arranged, between &apos;:y Department and the ilinistry ef National Service what steps are accessary for obtaining such records as are required for utilising in the beat wayN
mthe man power of the oountry.     Legislation would bt neeesaary for the full programme suggested.    If we oan secure what is required without legislation, so much the better.    The registration should be kept as simple ae poesible (not only to reduce erros and to prevent clog-ging the machine with record upon reoord, but also because ne*6l*ealy eompliefcfced t%o%xos yea&amp;.        of &amp;m P$mx))   and it should It eorralated with ata*r isu$osg of inioj&amp;ation, more particularly the returns of employed persons which employers are now required to furnish.3.    I would like to add two observations on the general question,(a) As already stated, outside agriculture (zhloh is practical-ly a protected industry), the number of men of physical fitness who are exempted by Tribunals is proportionately very email indeed, particularly when it is remembered that Tribunal exemptions cover not only the many essential home needs outside the protected industries, but also the export trade.    There is no gainsaying that the burden of military service has thrown a most severe strain on general industry and trade.I have received a large number of resolutions paesed by Tribunals protesting against the protection given by Government Departments to young men, and from information which I receive, I have reason to know that there exists grave dlsoontent on this ground.     It is all very well for Government Departments to aay that the retention of certain men is essential for national requirements. Persons of Intimate local knowledge and full competence know full well that in numerous oases oen new protected nan be spared without injuring national production in any material degree,I feel oenvinoed that, especially if there ie to be any question of raising the age limit for military service, the Government will be running a grave risk of irritating public opinion if much more drastic measures are not taken to ooiab out young men from protected industries.    Before deciding whether to raise the age lic.it, there would bo advantage in considering oloeely to what extent fit men oan be obtained for the Army by substituting older men for youiig men in protected industries and in speeding up the efforts, whioh are novr proceeding very slowly, to obtain recruits from soue of them (e,g, the ooal fining industry) It is well to bear in mind also that the ordinary ttAB man of, say, 40 to 60 is not really equal to the &quot;A&quot; man of 80 to 30 years of age for military servioe.In this connection, it is worthy of consideration whether immediate steps cannot be taken to secure that a larger proportion of youths who attain the age of 18 should be /-ade available for the Army, and not absorbed by *proteeted* industries.    In an ordinary year, Sdiie 370,000 youths attain this age in Great Britain;   but, according to the memorandum, only about 130,000 a year are obtained for military service,(b) X observe that the memorandum deals with ..an powerpyactibally only from the point of view of thie country. 1 would strongly press that, in line with the recent declarations of the Prime Minister, the question can be settled only by taking account of the resources and inten-tione of our AUise, particularly of the number of sen who will be placed in the field by the United States,W.
