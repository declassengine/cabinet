Signor Orlando&apos;s Government like that of Signor Boselli contains representatives of practically all parties except the Official Socialist. Of the Ministers (of whom the list is given in Report No. XVII) Bissolati and Berenini are Reformist Socialists; Sacchi, Fera and Nitti are Radicals; Orlando, Miliani and Ciuffelli are Democrats; Colosimo is a Giolittian Democrat; Meda
a Clerical;   Dari of the Right, ef which group Sonnino is an independent member.     There are no Republicans in the Cabinet but the group is represented amtng the Under-Secretaries by Chieea, whtse department of Aviation is attached to the Ministry of Arms and Munitions.Of the Neutralist or doubtful political elements, the Catholics, so far as can be gathered from the Clerical press, from the declarations of leading Catholics such as Signor Keda and Signer Nava and from the manifestoes published by Catholic organisations, are of one voice in proclaiming the necessity for unity,and for concentrating all energies on resistance.   Prayers,are being offered up in the Churches of Rome,The official Socialist party is now confessedly in disruption. The afcticle published by the two leaders of the Parliamentary group, Turati and Treves, and the speech of Prampolini at the sitting of Nov. 14th - both expressing a limited and carefully guarded adhesitn to the national cause - have called forth censure fr*m the editor of the Party organ, Serrati.     Socialist Corporations and other organisations have publicly taken up a patriotic attitude, while several individual Btmbers havo notified their withdrawal from the party.     The editor of Avanti, writing on Nov. 17th, confesses that he is not sure whether he any longer represents the majority of the Party.Signor Giolitti&apos;s speeoh 4n the Chamber on Nov. 14th was of a non-committal character.     He was the only speaker who went out of his way to lay stress 4.e-iay-e**ee8 upon the burden of re-sponsibility which rested on the shoulders of the Government2his words were &quot;it is no time for speech making or advioe since the Government alone possesses complete knowledge of the military and diplomatic conditions and it is for it alone to point the way. The nation will follow;   buu let the Government remember that the gravity of the-moment admits of no delays nor half mosoureo.     Let the Government, let indivual Ministers   think of the terrible
R1Ki it is nitice/ible thst no prominent or representative member of the new (Giolittian) Group of Parliamentary Union (at first nicke named the 47)   finds a place in the new Government.   Signor Valenzani. Under Secretary of Agriculture, seems to have accepted office without consulting his party and is not a man of any dis-tinction.     The Corriere della Sera asks why, iff the composition of the Government was intended to express a genera] reconciliation, has the thing been only half done?Is it by Orlando*s own wish or because from the other side there was no definite or hearty response to a definite invitation?   (viz., Orlando&apos;s telegram to Oiolitti.   See Henort XVII p.3.)   In fact Signor Giolitti, while acquiring considerable popularity by coming forward at this critical moment as a magnanimous patriot (an atti-tude which his organ La   Stampa is careful to enqphasise, hinting at the same time that his re-emergance had a much more than merely Parliamentary or temporary importance), has pledged himself to nothing.     There must he a certain amount of uneasiness v/ith regard to the situation thus created, and the Government&apos;s decision to defer discussion of the Estimates,     If, it is suggested, thfegr had been taken at once, the House could Nhave adjourned until February and in the mean time the situation would have had time to clear. As it is, between now and the end of December there will be just time enough for political intrigues, which Signor Oiolitti knows so well how to turn to account, to be set in motion, and it is impossi-bie to JtBeseo what use he may not make cf the events which must inevitably develop during the next few days or weeks.burden of responsibility which rests upon them;   on their decisions, on their action depends the future cf Italy ffcr a long period of her history.     The oonfidenoe and the wonderful calmness of the country are a great source of strength for the Government.     Let them make full use of it in order to save the honour and the future of the country&quot;.
Regrets have been expressed that Ciolitti was not included in the new Ministry.   The proposal seeno to have been made, but .&apos;to have been rejected by Giolitti on the ground that he was oon3cious of being too much distrusted by the Allies for such on idea to be contemplated.Signor Orlando, in his declaration in the Chamber on Nov. 14th, after acknowledging and oalling upon the Chamber to aeclaitf the loyal and prompt action of France and Great Britain in sanding troons to the support of Italy, went on to give public denial to the false reports current with regard to this country.   His actual words were - &quot;All the more therefore do the Government feel it their duty to recognise and give expression to those proofs of perfect solidarity in that one of the many intrigues of the enemy is shown in the diffusion of maliciously false reports about unjustified neglect of, or onerous conditions imptsed upon, this country by her Allies.     It is well that the tainted source of these rumours should be revealed, for whoever spreads them must know that he is thereby more or less willingly making himself the instrument of the enemy&apos;s plot.&quot;    This denial appears to have been the result 9f strong representations made to the Italian Minister for foreign Affairs by our Embassy at Rome, which also urged that the Italian fgverncient, instead *f suppressing all information, even such as would have partly discounted the Italian failure by revealing the fact that the soldiers had been misled and imposed uoon by tricks of the enemy, should take steps to keep tho poeple informed of the truth, and should intern or expel the numerous Germans who still appear to be at large in the country.    Baron Sonnino in reply brought forward the old argument of the 40,000 Italians in Germany and seemed generally reluctent to trke action.     It would seem however that steps ere being taken to isclate the Germans at large in Italy.
The demand for establishment of Parliamentary Commissions for control of the Government&apos;s war-policy finds very strong supo*rt among Deputies.     The question was raised by Signor Tittoni in his 3peech in the Senate on i*ov. 14th.     3:otion3 in favour of the in-novation hare been adopted by the Radical and Reformist Socialist groups and by the Parliamentary&apos; Union&apos; which numbers now 13C members.The press also demanded that publicity be given to the actual facts of the recent disaster as the best means of combating the extravagant and mischievous rumours everywhere current.     It ts suggested that Deputies should devote themselves to the wor&amp;of instructing their constituents.     It aooears that the Censorship auonresse3 all account of the .manoauvre3 and txi4ks tf the enemy oropaganda and forbids the introduction of all foreign newspapers (even of those addressed to the foreign Ilissions) for fear that the German and Austrian communiqueo should be read by the people.In order to demonstrate the hopeless position in which a separate peace ^ould place Italy, the Corrleri della Sera oh Nov. loth oub-lished an article which has been widely reproduced in the Italian press giving figures to show the dependency of Italy on her Allies in the matter of tonnage and necessary commodities 3uch as grain and coal.     The Allies, it is -minted out, would be under no obligation to stint themselves for the sake of a country which deserted them at a critical moment.Reports received at the Embassy from British Consuls in vorious cities of Italy show on the whole a satisfactory absence of dis-quieting symptoms.     In Tuscany, where disaffection was formerly-very strong, the recent didaster seems to have produced something like a revulsion of feeling, particularly in regard to this country (Livorno Report)       Prom Turin it is reported that there is complete calm, that the priests are alarmed and depressed, that great
reliance is placed on the assistance of the Alliee, and that the British soldier is popular.     In Milan there seemB a fortnight ago to have been considerable anxiety and talk of evacuation, but the arrival of the Allied troops was restoring confidence.     The spirit in the chief factories and works was said to be excellent.As early as Nov. 5th the exodus from Venice was well under way. vOa&amp;nrwas returning te the oity though there was still a run on the Savings-Bank.    A semi-official notice had warned the inhabitants of the increasing difficulty 6* victualling the oity and had united them to be prepared for orders to evacuate.On. Nov. 13th the Times Correspondent reported that only 20,000 inhabitants remained, workshops and hotels having been oloeed and every portable work of art removed.
