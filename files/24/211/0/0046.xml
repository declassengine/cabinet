THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.-SECRET.                 MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET.          COPY NO. 2                 International. Lab our- Organisation^              Forty-e ighth Se s a ion of the Governing Body.                 Memorandum by the Minister of Labour,.P.147(30)        ---&quot;      -*-------&quot;------                    Circulated for information only.           As my colleagues may be aware, I attended the       Session of the Governing Body that was recently held in Paris  at       the  invitation of  the French Government and I think the Cabinet       may  be interested  to have a brief statement of the chief business       transacted.       1* Budget  Estimates jr?or 1931.           The Budget estimates for 1931 put forward by the Director       proposed an  increase of 382,699 Swiss francs gross (or 224,656       francs net,  allowing for appropriations in aid).     After       detailed examination by the Finance Committee the proposals      were reduced by a  total of 203,600 francs.     These reductions      were the result of united pressure from the  Governments      represented  on the Finance Committee and the Director made no       difficulty in accepting them.    He appeared to have framed his      Estimates  on a fairly generous scale and expressed himself      unofficially as well satisfied with the provision granted him      for next year.    Some 30,000 francs of the  reduction was due  to       the  postponement of the Maritime Conference  proposed for 1931.      2* Reports on the.,working of Conventions adopted at Washington         TT9L9T&quot;ar.d Ge&apos;noeTTl936Tr           In 1931 ten years will have elapsed since these       Conventions  came into force and the Governing Body are required      to review  their working and decide whether the States      Members  should be  consulted on the need for  revision.    The      question before the Governing Body was therefore  whether the      reports  on these Conventions  should be submitted  without comment      to the International Labour Conference or whether the procedure      for revision should be opened in respect of  any of the                                                         /Conventions.
                                                  488  so**rCogent ions.  [Che Swedish Minister of labour made  a long and detailed statement in favour of the revision of the hours convention,   Certain other minor  points affecting otherConventions were raised,  and it was finally agreed that thedecision should be held over, at any rate, until the next session in June.3*   Farther consideration of Maritime  Questions.     These questions, of which, the most important  is that .of hours of Work at Sea, were discussed for the first time atthe Maritime Session of the Conference  in  October, 1929,Realising the difficulty and complexity of the question of hours of work at sea and  having in mind the strong objectionof shipowners, and to ,a lesser extent of seamen, to thepresence of a number of non-maritime powers at MaritimeSessions of the Conference, the Director proposed  that aPreparatory technical Conference confined  to maritime powers should be called in 1931  as affording the  best hope of progress and that the final discussion  should be deferredtill a special Maritime Session to be held in 193B,    his proposal had the full support of the 3nployers* Group but  didnot oommend itself either to the Workers or to a number ofthe Government representatives who refused to agree to so large a measure of special treatment being accorded to the shipowners.   A compromise resolution,  however, was finallyaccepted by which it was  decided to hold a preparatoryConference in 1931 and to leave the question of further actionto be settled in the light of its  results.4.   Hours of Work in industry.     I took the opportunity of this meeting to make a state-ment upon the Hours of Industrial  Employment Bill  and the  Hoursquestion in general.   A  Summary of my  statement is attached
as an appendix.    The statement was  cordially received, and both the Workers1  Group and the representative of the BelgianGovernment expressed their satisfaction at this ooncreteevidence of our good intentions.   They made it quite plain,however, that they would not  rest  content until we had ratified the Convention and made a very strong appeal to me to do allin my power to hasten the passage  of the Bill.     I think I ought to add that  I was most warmly receivednot only by all the Groups represented on the Governing Bodybut also by the President of the  French Republic and the other ministers with whom I came in contact.                               (Intd. ] M.  G. B.Ministry  of labour,    S.W.1.6th May,  1930.
                    APPENDIX.  ,Miss Bondfield began &quot;by  announcing the intention of theBritish Government to pass  the bill already introduced limiting the hours of work in industry to  a maximum of 48 a week, andwhen the bill was passed, to ratify the Washington Convention.She said that as the Government could not dispose of the timeof the House of Commons  as  it pleased, it was impossible forher to mention, the date  at  which  the second reading and otherstages of the bill would be taken, but she promised thatshe would do everything possible  to get it through withoutunnecessary delay, and said that  it was in the list of theGovernment measures to which precedence would be given.     Miss Bondfield said that the aim of the InternationalLabour Office was to arrive at an international standard, andthat the Washington Convention would achieve that aim so far asthe hours of labour were concerned.   The question of limiting the hours of labour was one of fundamental importance^ morethan ever so now in view of the tendency towards the rationalisation-tion of industry.   If rationalisation meant scientifioorganisation for the purpose of improved methods of productionit was to be welcomed, but  it must not be for the benefit ofone section of the community alone, and the workers must notsuffer from it, but must have their share in its advantages.The limitation of working hours was to the interest not of theworkers only,  but of the whole of the community.
