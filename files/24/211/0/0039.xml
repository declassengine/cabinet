&quot;DOCUiiENT  IS THE  PROPERTY OP HIS  BRlTANNld MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.copy No.40 (50)CABINET.          Popper production in Northern Rhodesia.     xiemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I desire to take the opinion of my colleagues on aquestion of policy which has arisen in respect of the CopperSupplies cf the United Kingdom and the recent discovery of very large copper deposits in Northern Rhodesia.   1, The consumption of raw copper in the United Kingdom is increasing, and is at present at the rate of round a.bout170,000 tons a year  (there is also an importation of semi-finished oopper in the form of rods, tubes, etc.).  this quantity is obtained approximately as follows:-  35,030 tonsproduced by British  smelters from imported ores, etc.;  90,000tons of electrolytic copper imported;  45,000 tons of othercopper  imported.   2. This copper material falls into  three classes:?unrefined  oopper suitable for  the manufacture of some brassesand for copper sheathing;  fire-refined  copper, used for  anumber  of  purposes requiring a pure metal;  and electrolyticcopper^ of high conductivity,  required by the electrical trades.    The  last is  the quality most in demand.     The refined  copper  produced In this country  is  almost wholly  fire-refined.  The  great bulk  of our supplies ofelectrolytic  copper  come from  the United States, with a  small proportion from Chile.   The  other  copper imported  comes  froma number of  sources  -  Chile, Belgian Congo, South and EastAfricaj and  several  other  countries.   The copper  ores smeltedhere  are obtained  chiefly from Spain and Canada.    3. The  world&apos;a  production of  copper ore is,  in terms  of copper  metal^  some  1,600,000  tons  a year.  Of  this approximately
one-half is produced in the United States; the next largestproducer is Chile, with about 240,000 tons/ the remainderis spread over a score of countries.   The total productionin the British Empire is only about 100,000 tons, and ofthat some part is controlled by United States interests which control altogether something over three-quarters ofthe world&apos;s output.   The Unfeted-Stat.es has a refiningcapacity of about 1,500,000 tons a year though the output is at present only  about 1,000,000 tons.  Though thereare refineries in Germany and Belgium this immenseAmerican capacity,  combined with American  control of so large a proportion  of the world&apos;s output of ore, hasresulted in an American control of the world  copper market -a  control  exercised by  COpper Exporters, Ltd., a UnitedStates company with which  European continental refinershave been  compelled to  associate  themselves.   4, The  dependence  of United- Kingdom copper-using industries upon  foreign supplies  of  material  has been due  to(i) the scantiness  of supplies of  copper  ores within  theEmpire or  under  British controlj   and  (ii) the  absence  of  any large electrolytic  refinery  here -  expert  opinion  is  that  the smallest  economic unit  must  have a  productive capacity  of50,000  tons  of refined  copper a  year,  and  adequate suppliesof material  for  a refinery of even that minimum size  couldnot be  counted upon*    The establishment   of  a  largerefinery  here has long  been regarded as a very  desirableaddition tn  our  industrial equipment,  but  as  impracticable for the  reason indicated.      This  position is a source  of serious  weakness to thecopper-using industries, whose  material is subject to control  both as  to  quantity and price which  may be exercisedto the  aavantage of their  competitors (particularly American),
and is alleged to have been so used;   and it is unsatisfaotpryfrom the defence point of view (an aspect which has beenoccupying the serious attention of the Principal SupplyOfficers1 Committee, of which I am Chairman, and the service departments).   5. The situation as to the world1s supplies of copper  orele likely to be very materially altered by the recentdiscoveries as to the extent of the deposits of northern rhodesia.  Whilst the potentiality of  output there is uncertain, it is unquestionably very greats  authoritativeestimates put it at 1300,000 tons (in terms of metal) a year in five years from now and at even as much as 1,000,000 tonBa year in from two to three decades.  It is hardly possibleto exaggerate the significance of this either to the economic development of Northern Rhodeela or to the position of theUnited States copper interests.   The latter are at presentin the position of controlling the world&apos;s supplies of copper,and of having a refining plant oapacity very much in excess or their present output, whilst to maintain the existingproduction they are being driven to utilise lower grade UnitedStates ore-deposits.  In these circumstances it is natural that they should be taking an active interest in the northern rhodesia deposits, which are of a high grade.   6.  The position as to the control of the mining concessions in Northern Rhodesia, which have been granted by the BritishSouth Africa Company, is obscure in sone of its details owingto the constantly changing inter-relations of the groupsconcerned, but its main features are clear.   The concessionsare in the hands of three groups:-      (a) One group is represented by Rhodesian Selection   Trust, Limited, which is effectively controlled by   interests associated with the American Smelting and Refining
   Company,  whioh dominates  the  copper  industry of the          1   United States.                                               I      (b) The second group is  represented by the Bwana   M&apos;Kubwa Copper uining Oompany,  Limitedj  this is pre-   dominantly British (its leading representatives are   Sir Edmund Davis, and Sir E.  Oppenheimer) but it has   close financial relations with Rhodesian Selection Trust,   Limited.      (o) The third group is represented by Rhodesian-Oongo   Border Concessions,  Limited,  which is controlled by a   combination of the Rio pinto  Company, the Union Corporation   of South Africa, the British  South Africa Company,   Messrs. Lazard Bros,, Messrs. N.M. Rothschild and Sons   with some others.  This group was formed about a year   ago to prevent the large  and  promising  concessions of the   Shodesian Border Concessions, Limited,  falling under   American control.  The Selection Trust,  Limited, has an   interest, but the control in  this case  is  effectively   British (it is represented  by Sir Auckland  Geddes).   7.  The programme of the  Imperial Smelting  Corporation,Limited, a combination of British and Australian non-ferrousmetal interests, of which Sir  Robert Horne is  Chairman  (the directors including the Earl of  Inohoape and Sir Cecil Budd),includes the erection of a large copper-refinery  in the UnitedKingdom.  I am informed that the interests represented by  SirAuckland Geddes, and probably  also those represented by  Sir  E.Oppenheimer in the Bwana M&apos;Kubwa Oompany,  would be prepared  toco-operate, and  that the scheme  can be proceeded with  immediate-ly if satisfactory arrangements  can be made to secure  anadequate and permanent  supply of the raw material.     It  has,therefore, been  represented to  me  by  Sir Auckland Geddes
that that condition, with the resultant development of anew and important industry in.this country, the strengthening ofthe position of the British copper-using industries &quot;by thelessening of their dependence on American-controlled supplies,and a great improvement in the position from the point of viewof national defence, can best he secured by the absoluteprohibition of the export of copper ore or raw copper from northern Ehodesi a except for treatment &quot;within the British Empire.Sir A. Geddes was definitely against prohibition of exportsaccompanied by a system of licensing.   The object of theprohibition is two-fold:  (a) to ensure that the refining iscarried on eitber in Northern Rhodesia itself (which is apossibility as regards a portion of the&apos; production) or else wherein the Empire (the only probable place being the United Kingdom),and (b) to discourage American efforts to acquire control of the concession-holding companies, since stich control would not havethe effect of securing supplies for the American refineries.     As regards the United Kingdom I am informed by sir A.Geddesand Sir 0. Budd that plans for a refinery are in an advanced stage, that alternative sites are being considered, and that the requisite finance is available.   It must, however, be someeighteen months or two years before the refinery could comeinto operation;  on the other hand, it is unlikels?- that therewill be any appreciable output in northern Rhodesia within thatperiod.   8. A proposal similar to that made by Sir Auckland Geddeswas made last year by the Governor of Northern Rhodesia, onrepresentations from Sir E. Oppenheimer. and communicated bythe Colonial Office to the Principal Supply Officers Committee.The Colonial Office informed the Committee (2Sth June, 1929)that &quot;the Secretary of State is advised that the Governor of
Northern Rhodesia has power to regulate the exportation of minerals, including copper and its ores&quot;.   The Colonial Officeletter also stated that &quot;Lord Passfield has also given&quot;consideration to the question whether there is any moral&quot;obligation resting on Eis Majesty&apos;s Government which might&quot;preclude the regulation of mineral exports as may seem fit&quot;to them, and has come to the conclusion that no such&quot;obligation exists&quot;.   The concessions have been granted by  theBritish South Africa Company, and I understand the opinion justquoted not only applies to the international aspect of theaction which has been suggested but means that there is noobjection to it as affecting the value of the concessions whichhave been granted.   9. The Colonial Office at the same time drew attention tothe possibility that, as part of Northern Rhodesia lies withinthe Conventional Basin of the Congo, the imposition of such  acondition might be objected to on the ground of infringement ofthe Convention of St. Gormain-en-Laye, 1919, but pointed outthat at present mining development in Northern Rhodesia isalmost wholly outside that Basin.   That Convention was to be reviewed ten years after ratification and accordingly is nowunder consideration.   The consensus of British commercialopinion appears to be that it is inexpedient to do anything which would imperil  the maintenance of the existing regime,and whilst there Is a desire that the boundaries of the conventional Basin should, if possible, be so modified as tobring them into accordance with territorial boundaries, therebyexcluding from it the whole of Northern Rhodesia, it appearsunlikely that such a proposal could be put forward withoutstimulating other Governments concerned to make proposals for revision in other respects also.
    10.  It  is,  I think,  clear that whether the prohibition suggested  by Sir A. Geddes.is imposed or not, the copper bearing fields of Northern  Rhodesia  will be developed.   The real question  for decision  is whether the prohibition is necessary  in order to secure the establishment of an electrolytic copper refinery on a substantial scale in this country.   United States interests already control some portion of  the  potential output in  ITorthem Rhodesia;  the United States  are now for the  first time beginning to import copper for local  consumption,  and  the refining capacity of that country is greatly in excess of present production.   All these factors  appear to point to the conclusion that tho United  States  yjould naturally look to any new source of supply for increasing their existing supplies o:? raw material, expectations which would of course be at once frustrated if exportation  to the United States, in common with all other foreign countries, was  prohibited.    11.  On  the  other hand the action  suggested would certainly be  contrary  to the present  policy of the Government as declared both  in this country and at Geneva.   Any departure from that  policy in the present case might not only bo resented by  the United  States, as the country most directly affected,  but  could not fail to have repercussions upon our international  efforts to get rid of  trade barriers generally.    12,  It  lias  been suggested that it might be possible for Northern Rhodesia to obtain the desired result not by a prohibition  but by a heavy  export duty levied on all copper exported from  that territory to countries not within the,British Empire.   Such  action would follow the precedent of the differential export duty on tin ore  which has for men;- years been operative in the lederated 1-ialay States and which was
intended to secure, and has in fact secured, that the ore issmelted at Singapore or in this country.   To he effectivesuch a duty on exported copper would have to he very high, andit would not seem possible to distinguish it in principle iroma prohibition.   I cannot indeed see that from the point ofview of our general economic policy a heavy export duty presentsany appreciable advantage as compared with a prohibition.   13. When I saw Sir A. Geddes I endeavoured to ascertain from him the actual attitude hitherto adopted by the american interests towards the proposal to set up a large copper refineryin this country.   I gathered that the American interests had shown themselves as willing to envisage the possibility of theestablishment of a refinery on the basis that they would beallowed to participate.   This may partly be due to the expectation of British Government action to preserve Rhodesiansupplies for this country.   But however that may be,Sir A. G-eddes said, that he had already had a proposal from certain American copper interests to provide all the moneythat would be required for the British refinery, an offer whichhad been refused.   I am not, however, clear that the american interests would not be willing to support the establishment ofa refinery if they were allowed to participate in the under-taking in some measure.   14. It will be seen that the question upon which a decision is required involves most important considerations relating to employment, defence and the Colonies as well as trade andindustry and I would suggest that before the Cabinet take afinal decision, they should remit the matter to a CabinetCommittee, who might not only consider the various matters referred to in this note, but also discuss the questions involved with the interests directly concerned.
