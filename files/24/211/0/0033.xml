CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT  POLICY  (1930)  COMMITTEE.                                  REPORT.    THE Committee appointed by the Cabinet*  to  consider the unemployment situation in the light of the latest figures and in this  connection to have regard tothe Memorandum  of Sir Oswald Mosley, have met  and  have agreed upon thefollowing Report:     In view of the fact that a Committee of the Economic Advisory Council hasbeen examining (see CP. 126 (30)) the unemployment, figures from the point of viewof how far  they may reflect a real increase in the volume of  unemployment, we havenot considered it  necessary to  go into that part of our terms of reference,  but wehave addressed ourselves primarily to the broad  and undisputed fact that so far theschemes we have sanctioned do not appear to have made any substantial impressionupon the volume of unemployment.    Our  examination has  been confined  in  the  main to  the  matters raised in Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s Memorandum, as this is a comprehensive examination from hispoint of view of the Government policy and of suggestions for more vigorous actionon certain lines.    We  sympathise with  his  expression  of dissatisfaction at  the  comparativeineffectiveness of what we have been able  to do so far, and we  have examined his suggestions in a sympathetic spirit.    The  substance of Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s Memorandum may be summarised under three heads :     (1) That for  the  purpose both of  immediate unemployment  plans and of1          long-term economic  reconstruction, a far larger and more comprehensive          organisation is  required than  has yet  been employed, or  is even  now          contemplated.    (2) That measures can be taken  within the existing resources of Government by          which  the unemployment problem can be  materially  reduced  within  a          relatively short period of time.    (3) That the  real problem of permanent  economic reconstruction requires not          only a greater co-ordination of the Government activities, but a mobilisa-          tion of  national resources  on  a  larger scale  than  has yet  been          contemplated.    For  the  purpose of realising this object  a  number of suggestions are put-forward :                                                                 &apos;Creation of New Department.    (1) A new organisation for dealing with unemployment, which apparently isintended  to supersede the Office of the Lord Privy Seal, and the establishment of anew organisation  of Government under the auspices  of the Prime  Minister, who should  be  armed  with  an adequate  staff.   In substance, as we  understandSir Oswald&apos;s scheme of organisation, it may be summarised  as follows    (a) A committee of twelve paid whole-time economists,  assisted  by honorary          committees of business men, &amp;c, and working in  sub-committees, will (if          they can achieve  agreement) lay down the entire economic policy of the          Government.                   * On February 8, 1930 (Cabinet 6 (30), Conclusion 1 (b)).      [2076,0]                                                        B
     (b)  The Prime Minister, in whose  &quot; Department &quot; they will  work and from           whom alone  they  derive their authority, will endorse their conclusions           (retaining, no doubt, though it  is not expressly stated,  the  right  to           overrule them).     (c)  The Prime Minister,  assisted for this purpose by a Committee of Ministers           meeting periodically, will give  executive  effect to the decisions of  the           economists, his executive instrument being a body of twelve higher Civil           Servants (assisted by subordinate staff), conjoined, so it appears, with           committees of officials, each presided over by a Minister dealing with the           executive aspects of special subjects.     Although the precise relations  between the proposed  organisation  and  the existing Departments is not  explained, it is clear that this scheme involves  the creation of  a  new  Department  bearing immensely widespread responsibility  for policy in many fields and also in a material degree for its execution.   If it be within the compass of a single man, the presidency of  such  a Department would  call  for his whole time and his undivided energy. We do not see how the Prime Minister, who in virtue  of his great position is unavoidably encompassed with problems and responsibilities of the most varied kinds, could  add to his burden  so great and  so intricate a responsibility. Nor could other Ministers, who by the plan are loosely associated with the Prime Minister  partly in an advisory capacity and partly  as Presidents of  Committees of officials, spare time from their ordinary  duties for connected and persistent service in this sphere. More and more the decisions of such an organisation on all  but the  greatest issues  must  tend  to become decisions  of experts  and  officials, and the  suggested association with the Prime  Minister of the Permanent Head of the Civil Service as his general adviser and as the instrument for conveying to Ministers the decisions of the new Department could not  obscure the fact that the  proposal will cut at the root of the individual responsibilities  of Ministers, the especial responsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the sphere of  finance, and the collective responsibility of the Cabinet to Parliament.  Most strange of all is the proposal  that the body of officials charged with the production of  policy should be assisted by Committees containing elements nominated by the other political parties.  It is hard to believe that the other political  parties, if invited to share responsibility, would be content with seats so far removed from the seat of authority.  If they were, it is easy to see how great  would be the parlia- mentary difficulties likely to arise from the rejection (by officials) of their advice.     In short, Sir  OswalcTs proposal could only be reconciled with the principles of Parliamentary Government if the new organisation confined itself to consideration of  questions of  policy,  and its  proposals  were  first  submitted  to Departmental Ministers for consideration and thereafter brought before the Cabinet, the decisions of the Cabinet being thus carried out by the Departments concerned.  But for this limited function of assisting  the Prime Minister in the consideration of economic policy the elaborate machinery proposed is obviously  unwieldy and top-heavy, and the Economic  Advisory  Council which has  just  been set  up is  a much more appropriate organisation. Long-Term Reconstruction Schemes.     (2) Passing on from his  scheme  of a central economic staff to produce ideas, Sir Oswald proceeds to  put forward  plans  for  a more scientific approach to the solution  of the Unemployment problem. He divides the problem into two main features:  (a)  long-term  planning of  permanent  economic  reconstruction, and (b)  short-term schemes for the immediate relief of unemployment.  The Memorandum asserts that these are two really distinct problems, and the failure to regard them  as such is responsible for much of our present difficulty.  It is admitted, however, that these two problems frequently overlap, and executive action to deal with them must also overlap.                               ,   .     The  contention that these two features are distinct problems which  can  be differentiated indicates, we submit, a confusion of mind,  and  any attempt to treat them as  distinct is bound to lead to conflict of interests, dispersal of resources and ultimate  failure.  This  policy  involves  the  acceptance of  non-remunerative andwasteful schemes  for encouraging immediate employment, although they postpone and render more difficult the reorganisation of the national economy.  As the Lord Privy Seal has so often pointed out, short-term schemes for the immediate, relief ofunemployment must be tested  by their economic value  and by the contribution they
are likely to make to reducing the cost of production and adding to the economic resources and capacity of the country.   &apos; The Governments  great difficulties  from the point of  view of effecting animmediate and substantial reduction in the figures of unemployment are two, first,that none of the schemes which can be put into operation at once are likely to absorbanything but a comparatively insignificant number of the unemployed, and second,that  the  long-term  programme aimed at  what  is  called  permanent -economicreconstruction must inevitably at first add to the numbers of the  unemployed.  Butwe must be prepared to  face these facts and to wait for a justification of our  policyuntil its effectiveness is shown in a reduction of the cost of production and an increasein the competitive power of British industry.    The  Statement  in the  Memorandum  (p.  11)  that  the   Government  are&quot; concentrating on such rationalisation schemes and. holding out hope to the country that we are thereby reducing immediate unemployment &quot;  is indefensible.  On thecontrary,  we have always  considered  it very important to  avoid giving  such an impression.   We have repeatedly pointed out that the first  effects of rationalisationmust inevitably be to increase rather than diminish unemployment, and that we mustbe prepared to face the temporary unpopularity that the realisation of this fact may cause.    We have received from Sir Oswald a further note in which he elaborates his views as to the Governments responsibility for long-term reconstruction  schemes.We print this note in Appendix &quot; A.&quot;  Sir Oswald recapitulates (not very accurately,in our judgment, as will be seen) the features of the existing organisations concernedwith rationalisation  of industry and he argues that the Government should assumedirect and effective control of the whole process.  For this purpose he proposes thatan organisation similar to Securities Management Trust, Ltd., should be created, theGovernment holding a controlling interest and the banks and leading issuing  housesbeing invited to participate.   In the event of the banks not desiring to participate in all the activities which the Government might desire to promote, he would advocate the Government taking powers to proceed on lines similar to the old Trade FacilitiesAct.    This note seems to us to contain certain misapprehensions which  it is desirableto remove before commenting on the constructive suggestions put forward.    Sir Oswald suggests that the Government, has assumed  responsibility for thepolicy of  rationalisation to a degree that requires the assumption of control overthe machinery  for giving  effect  to the policy.   The Lord Privy Seal has indeedexpressed the considered view that the recovery of industry can only be attained byrationalisation.  He has, however, been particularly  careful  to  guard against theimpression that this objective can be attained by Government action.  The statementauthorised by the Governor of the Bank of England, which the Lord Privy Seal made-at Manchester on the 10th January (of which we print a copy in Appendix  &quot;B&quot;),gives no ground for such an impression.  Both in this speech and on other occasionshe has stated that trade facilities can only lead to bolstering up inefficiency, and haswarned  those engaged  in  industry  against undue reliance on  Government help.Subsequently, he has made it clear, in reply to questions in the House of Commons,that, while he is ready to co-operate, it is for the leaders of industry to formulateplans  and for the City to find the money.  The fact that the Government is anxiousto see rationalisation carried out, and is prepared to use its good offices to promotethat objective,  does not by any  means imply that it must assume control  over theprocess  of execution or accept responsibility for the detailed arrangements involved..    The Note also suggests that the available machinery for working out rationalisation-tion plans is inadequate and involves overlapping. The account given of the present arrangements is based on incomplete information.    The Iron and Steel and  Cotton industries are at present  being investigated by sub--Committees of  the  Economic Advisory Council,  but apart from  this, theEconomic  Advisory  Council are  not  taking any part in working out  concreteproposals  for the reorganisation  of  particular  industries.   The two  Committeesreferred to in the second paragraph of the Note  are not part  of  the machinery fordealing  with concrete rationalisation schemes.   They consist  of  groups of leadingmen in industry and the City who have exchanged views with the Lord Privy Seal on,general  questions of industrial policy-and are prepared to hold themselves availablefor consultation on such questions.   Concrete proposals for  particular industriesmust come from the industries themselves, though the Lord Privy Seal has expressed.&apos;his willingness to co-operate, and has  in fact been asked to do so in  certain cases.,&apos;.      [20760]                                  .                     B 2                                                                           -  Jk
 There is no overlapping as between the Lord Privy Seal and the City.  The Lord Privy Seal is in a position to help industrialists by advice as to the kind of schefne which is likely  to be  acceptable in the City,  and generally by forming a bridge between industry and finance. As regards the organisation in the City, the manage- ment of Securities Management Trust has been strengthened, and,  as was recently announced, a further institution has been created, the Bankers&apos; Industrial Develop- ment Company, in which  all the principal financial houses will  participate,  with the object  of  ensuring  the  necessary financial  support  for   properly-framed rationalisation schemes.     It must be borne in mind that the  elimination of vested interests is a no less essential and  much  more  arduous part of rationalisation  than  the provision of fresh capital.  The task  of prevailing upon proprietors, shareholders and debenture holders  to accept the reduction sometimes even the complete writing-off of their nominal  claims  is necessarity long and difficult.   Heavy  bank  overdrafts are  a common feature of these cases, and the anxiety of the Banks to save a higher pro- portion  of their loans than the  situation warrants is  not the  least  formidable obstacle.   The conflicting claims of these various interests can only be adjusted to economic facts as the result of experience, and as reductions are resisted  as long as hope remains, this process  naturally takes time.     There is no evidence that progress with sound schemes is being held up  for lack of finance.  The schemes which have failed to secure financial support  have  been unsound; either they have been  insufficiently  comprehensive, or  they  would have placed an excessive burden on the reconstructed undertaking owing to the  reluctance of proprietors and creditors to face the hard realities of the situation.     The situation may thus be summarised as follows :      (1)  The  Government  has  undertaken  no responsibility necessitating   the           assumption of control over the machine.     (2) The City can provide, and is providing, the necessary machinery both on the           constructive and on the financial side.     (3)  The  principal  difficulties  arise from the reluctance of  proprietors  and           creditors  to face loss.     (4)  There is no evidence that sound schemes are held  up for lack of finance.     The broad question of  policy raised by Sir Oswald in his Note is whether  the Government should assume  direct executive and financial responsibility for carrying out  definite schemes  of rationalisation, or whether they should confine themselves to advocating rationalisation as a general policy and to the work of liaison between industry and the City.     The  proposal  made  by  Sir  Oswald is  that  the Government  should simply duplicate the organisation set up by the Bank of England to further rationalisation schemes, and that this Government organisation should be able to provide finance under a  Trade Facilities Act for  schemes  in which the Banks were not  prepared to co-operate.  AVhatever might be the ultimate effect of such action by the Govern- ment on the process  of rationalisation, there  can be no doubt that its immediate effect would be to stop all the activity at present in progress.  On the one side, it is practically certain  that if the Government announced their intention to control, by executive and financial action, the process of rationalisation in industry, the efforts which are now being made by the City to set up organisations for this purpose would cease.   On the other  side, it is equally plain that such efforts as are now being put forward  by industries to set their house in order would slacken, indeed,  would be quite likely to die  away  altogether.  It  is  inevitable that the existing  proprietors and creditors should be  regarding as  hard and  ruthless  the  attitude  which is necessarily being adopted by those who  are to put up  the new money, and if  the former see any prospect of Government intervention, they will certainly stiffen their demands beyond  anything that the reconstructed enterprises  can bear, in the hopethat they will be able to  get more out of the Government than they can  from theCUty. i-; Thus all present progress would cease, and months would be wasted beforethe necessary legislation (which would be most contentious) could^ be passed and thenew machinery could  be started.     For some industries there is no option but to rationalise.if they are to survive,but rationalisation is  a drastic process.  Its immediate effects are wholly unpleasant.Proprietors, shareholders  and creditors must face heavy losses, sometimes even ruin,works must be closed down, in some cases for good and all, workpeople must bedisplaced.   If the process, is carried  through without  flinching, prosperity will
 follow^ but it is too much to expect that the  future prospect of prosperity for the industry will do much.to soften the bitterness to which these present sacrifices will give rise.   The sacrifices are essential if rationalisation is to fulfil its:purpose of putting industry upon a profitable basis, but it would be practically impossible for any Government to enforce them, in view of the inevitable pressure that would be put upon them both  in  Parliament and  elsewhere.   One  instance may suffice to illustrate this.   The town of Mossley, in Lancashire^ contains some 21 spinning mills, of which 13  are closed down and a further 6 will close shortly.   Some of these mills are being bought up by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation,1 and it may very well be that the Corporation will take the view that they must be permanently closed. It seems very doubtful whether such a step, however necessary, would be politically possible if the Government had any measure of responsibility for the actions of the Lancashire Cotton Corporation.     Government control over  rationalisation would presumably involve  the  use of Government credit, somewhat on the lines of the now extinct Trade Facilities Act. Under such a scheme applications would no doubt be examined by a strong Advisory Committee, but, while such a Committee would be able to see that the finance was on sound  lines,  it is  more than doubtful  whether,  particularly in some of the very important and embarrassing questions of personnel which must arise, they would be able to deal with schemes  as drastically as financiers  and accountants acting in a professional capacity  in  connection with commercial propositions.  The only satis- factory test of the commercial prospects of an undertaking is the willingness of an Issuing House to invite the public to invest their money in it and of the public to subscribe their money.  The removal of all risk from this process by a Government guarantee would destroy this test, and there is no equally effective one which can be put in  its place.    For these reasons we feel that the best service which the Government can render at the  present time to the cause of reconstruction is to continue to act as a bridge between industry and finance, and to use its influence  to facilitate progress and to secure  that the existing machinery is developed  on  right lines in the light of experience.  At the same time, the great weight attaching to the public utterancesof Ministers affords a valuable opportunity of impressing upon  the industrial world the need  for rationalisation as affording the best,  if not the only, prospect of future prosperity.   The Government should  not, however, relieve the parties primarily interested of  the direct  responsibility  for the technical arrangements made,  and should bold out no hope of public credit being used to prevent private losses.Short-term Schemes of Employment.    Under the heading of short-term schemes for the immediate relief of unemploy-ment the Memorandum is very disappointing.  Apart from a  passing reference to slum clearance and land drainage, both of which are  the  subject  of forthcoming legislation, Sir Oswald Mosley has no suggestion  to make except the refuge of an ambitious road programme.  He proposes a national loan of  200 millions largely for new roads and road improvements, without advancing a single concrete scheme. He might just as well have put the figure at  1,000 millions.  Either figure is equally divorced from the practical considerations governing road schemes.    We agreed last summer to the immediate inception of two  programmes of road improvements totalling  37 millions.  Very generous terms of grant were fixed, and in view of the desirability of starting work at once, the Ministry of Transport were given a completely free hand by the Treasury for several months.  What are  the results up to date?  Under the trunk road programme, schemes amounting to an estimated  cost of   approximately   10  millions  have   been  approved,  and under  the  5 years&apos;  programme,  approvals  have  reached  17 millions.   Not- withstanding  these  large  totals,  however,   the   number   of  men   actually placed  at  work  on  the  trunk  road  programme  by  the  end  of  February was only  1,620.  The  figures  of employment  on   the   5  years&apos;   programme are coupied with those for schemes undertaken under recent annual programmes of road improvements, and the combined figure of 6,913 men is understood to be largely attributable to the latter.   We  can hardly place the  responsibility  for  this slow progress in any great measure on the condition as  to the employment of transferred labour, for it follows the experience of all previous Governments.   Of  the large schemes of road improvement launched in 1924-1925 we understand that  4,800,000 of grant still remains to  be spent, and in the current financial year substantial pay-
 ments are still being made under earlier schemes, even going back as far as Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s first programme of 1920.  The fact must be admitted that with the greatest goodwill in the world and with the most liberal financial aid from the Government, the amount of work that can be put in hand in such a period as Sir Oswald Mosley has in mind for a short-term programme is strictly limited by a number  of factors, of which, perhaps, the most important  at present is the need for consultation and negotiation as to routes and the inevitable delays in the acquisition of many small parcels of land.  Could our road programme be expanded to anything approaching the figure of  200 millions, additional difficulties would doubtless arise in obtaining sufficient skilled staff and competent contractors.     The delays incidental to the fixing of the route and the acquisition of land will undoubtedly tend to be greatest  in the  very areas where the  work  is of greatest economic value,  i.e., in the more populous districts of the country  (including, of course, the  depressed areas), and there is a natural tendency, therefore, for the Department to push on with  less desirable schemes in more open country, in order to achieve speedier results.   If such delays are to be obviated, we feel that it is not only the rights of Local Authorities and the whole machinery of Local Government that will have to be overridden, but that a very drastic policy would be necessary in dealing with the rights of private individuals.     The overriding of Local Government machinery would raise a large issue.   Qur Local  Government system is being severely tried at the present day by the heavy increase in the cost of local  services, and there is a tendency in some quarters to. seek the  apparently  easy solution  of increasing the responsibilities  of the  State. Suggestions are made not only for instituting a system of national roads, but for increasing State control in  regard to education, police, and the maintenance of the able-bodied  poor. Unless we are careful to nurture the plant of local government which has been slowly growing for 300 years, we may rapidly find the.machinery of central government hopelessly clogged by the transfer of these responsibilities, and our democratic system of  local  government, on which we justly pride ourselves, largely replaced by a bureaucratic system on the continental model.     We need not enter into the political objections to a ruthless disregard of private interests in an endeavour to launch a gigantic programme of road works in a very short period, but Ave must refer to the effect of such a programme in other directions. Sir  Oswald Mosley  suggests  that it  should be  instituted without  regard to the limiting factors of reaction on the railways and expense.  He suggests that a short period of intensive road construction  of  this kind could scarcely, within the narrow limits  of time suggested, derange our transport  equilibrium.  In this matter, of course, it is  the amount of the programme rather than the period of time it requires that has to be  considered.   The whole expenditure on road improvements since the war falls far short of   200 millions,  and yet  it  cannot be  denied that this expenditure has materially  assisted the transference of traffic from the railways to the roads with grave results on the ability of our  railways to assist  the depressed industries, either by reduction of freights  or by the introduction of desirable transport facilities   and  improvements.   Regarded  from  this  aspect  a  large programme of road construction and improvement cannot in our view be dissociated from the long term planning of our future transport facilities to which Sir Oswald Mosley refers.     We are driven to the same conclusion in considering the purely financial aspects of the matter.  The amount which can without injury to other national interests be found either by taxation or by loan for improving  the economic equipment of the country is necessarily limited, and the apparent ease with which road works can be undertaken should not blind us to the vital importance of weighing the relevant claims of different schemes  to share in this amount. At the present time, we are commonly contributing  in respect of  road schemes as much as  75 per cent, of thenet cost,  and sometimes as much as 97-1 Per cent., whereas the grants that are being paid in aid of other forms of transport and improvements of revenue-producingundertakings generally, rarely exceed 25 per cent,  or 30  per cent.  Hitherto, publicopinion  has  been inclined  to accept the  rather  specious explanation  that  the separation of  the Road Fund from the Exchequer justifies this wide difference oftreatment, but  even this  explanation is breaking down as the Road Fund comes to rely more and more upon the Exchequer, and there are  signs that  the public isawakening to  this  anomaly,  and is  beginning to  complain of  the  disparity, oftreatment represented, say, by grants of 75 per cent, of the cost of improvements ofa road leading to a port  and of 25 per cent, for improvements at the port.  Higher;
 terms  and easier conditions have  been  allowed by  the Unemployment  Grants Committee to schemes  of  a non-revenue-producing character submitted by  local authorities, but it is questionable whether the nation is obtaining full value for its money in these cases, and  we are at the moment more disposed to  recommend an enquiry into this aspect of their activities than to favour an uncritical trebling of all that is being done.  It is obvious that our resources are not unlimited, and we are fully in agreement with the suggestion that the Government ought to review all the various schemes involving expenditure so that the  money available should be devoted to the  most desirable objectives instead of being rushed into one commitment after another without examining their effects on our policy as a whole.     Examination of the unemployment figures by industries shows that such national schemes as are advocated by Sir Oswald Mosley can do little to provide work for the present unemployed.  Workers in the textile (mainly women), pottery, glass, chemical, shipbuilding, general engineering, clothing, food, printing and paper,  and distri- butive  trades,  which account for  more than half the present unemployment, could not be absorbed in road or national work schemes.     The  problem is really to restore prosperity to the four staple industries of cotton and wool, iron and steel and engineering, coal, and shipbuilding, and all  these are more or less export trades.   The revival of the first three would  automatically solve the problems of the fourth.   Though the recovery may be slow we are convinced that the only  hope is  in  the long-term programme, which  will restore the  competitive power of British industry.     It is unnecessary to say that in writing  thus we  do not  wish to ignore or to belittle the work which  has been accomplished by  the Lord Privy Seal in connection with short-term schemes of  employment.  We have stated some  of the  practical limitations by which all sound policy must inevitably be governed, and we have indicated the dangers which lie in the.path of any extravagant schemes.  The Lord Privy  Seal has recently laid before the Cabinet  a paper in which  he  summarises what has been accomplished in the  last ten months.   The programme  of works is ,already approaching  100 millions, and is steadily expanding.  The rate of expendi- &apos;ture-unless, indeed, it is  to be  entirely  reckless and wasteful-is governed by considerations which no Government can control.   We  entirely agree with the Lord Privy seal&apos;s view that the alternative of first raising a  great Development Loan and then looking for ways of spending it has no advantages  at all. Retirement Pensions.\     The foregoing financial  considerations  apply with equal  cogency to  the  other main  section of  Sir Oswald  Mosley&apos;s short-term programme,  viz., a scheme of Retirement Pensions.   This question was  explored  in considerable detail  by a Committee last year, and their Reports were subsequently reviewed by a Cabinet. Committee.  The conclusions of the majority of the Cabinet Committee are  set out in CP. 366 (29) and were briefly as follows :-     1.  That  the  scheme  submitted to them amounted,  in  factA to  spending            approximately  165,000,000 in all in providing, on the average, 5^ years&apos;            employment for a number of younger persons, estimated at various figures            up to 280,000.   The estimates of employment and  of the consequent            savings on unemployment benefit and  poor  relief Were little  better than            a guess, but on the basis of 230,000 people placed in work the net cost of            the scheme (i.e., the cost after deducting the amount of these savings)            averaged  over the h\ years was, roughly,  20,000,000 a year. ;    2.  That these persons would be placed in industry only at the price of removing            390,000 elderly persons from productive employment, that there would be            no increase  in  the sum  total either  of  employment or of productiveIcapacity in the country.     3. That  any  temporary and  restricted scheme  on the lines  proposed to ithe            Committee would give  rise to inequalities of treatment and  widespread            discontent which could  hardly  be removed by anything less  than ai           permanent  scheme.   The  passage of  a  temporary  scheme  through            Parliament would, moreover, be rendered difficult by the uncertainty both            as to costs and results.     The majority of the Committee came to the decision--subsequently endorsed by the Cabinet -that these considerations constituted an  insuperable objection to  the adoption of the scheme.
    We agree that our policy should be to shorten the working life upon some well-considered plan fitted to the needs of industry and consistent with a permanentlydeveloping prosperity.  This we are doing at one end with our Bill  for raising the&apos;school age, and at the other end we must see whether the  Committee which is con-sidering the revision and extension of national insurance will  be able to produce ascheme of  retirement pensions free from  the  serious objections  to an emergencyscheme which would be nothing more than giving unemployment pay to aged peopleat a higher rate than younger unemployed receive,  without reducing the number ofunemployed in the least but, in fact, rather increasing it.Credit Policy.    Finally,  Sir Oswald  Mosley  recurs  to the  question of credit policy.  Herepeatedly urges that we must get  away from the  &quot;whole fetish of export trade,&quot;and he appears to have swallowed, without properly digesting it, the Keynes-LloydGeorge programme of internal development loans.   So far as there is anything to besaid for this programme, it can be justified only as  a temporary emergency measure,and we have already  taken steps to put in hand economic development schemes tothe fullest extent that they can be produced;  indeed, the criterion of  economicjustification is far from severe.  But there are obvious limits to such action, if it isnot to defeat itself, and there is no serious economist who  would recommend it as along-term policy.  It is  quite absurd  to compare the conditions prevailing in the!.United States -a self-supporting country, with vast internal resources and a  highprotective  tariff -with the competitive conditions under  which the population ofthese  islands  must live  and work if  the  standard of  living to  which we areaccustomed is not to be radically altered.  We are not able  to build up prosperityon the basis of inflated prices and increased costs of production, and if we start onsuch a policy we may easily find that  instead of imitating America we will  landourselves in the same economic situation as Australia.    Sir Oswald does not give the grounds upon which he considers that the raising of Government loans to the amount of  100 millions or  200 millions &quot;would  havea good effect in rallying the present  financial situation.&quot;   The statement appearsto us misconceived.   The  present  Government  has  had to raise the 5 per  cent.Conversion Loan last autumn and the 4^ per cent. Conversion Loan for which the lists have recently closed, at a price yielding 5 per cent, to the investor, in order tomeet maturing liabilities and to  reduce the excessive load of Treasury Bills.  the investment market is already fully stocked.   On the top  of this, vast new direct government issues,  not  for conversion or  funding of debt,  but  for immediate;expenditure,  would be  received  in  an  atmosphere  of  scepticism and  distrust.Investors  would  see  in  them  a  campaign  of waste,  in  which  all  the  economic considerations which have governed public expenditure in the past would be thrownto the winds.  If the money could be raised in such an atmosphere,  it could only beraised at  high  rates of interest dislocating general investment values, and therebycausing a setback in neAV business enterprise, which the policy  is intended  to foster.Market conditions, left to themselves, should improve with the lower bank rate andeasier money conditions  which  the  recent  Government issues  were themselvesdesigned to foster.  Considerable  issues  will be  possible  to finance  the  approveddevelopment schemes, many of which, moreover, involve private capital issues ratherthan  direct Government borrowing.  But  Government issues must  be kept within reasonable dimensions if they are not to throw the capital markets into confusion and restrain the ordinary borrower from coming  forward for ordinary  industrialrequirements.    But there are deeper objections to the whole policy outlined  by Sir oswald mosley.  One of the factors to which our  attention has been drawn at the presenttime by all the leading industrial and financial authorities is the lack of confidence in.  the future of British industry.  That this lack of confidence exists  cannot be doubted, and  it is a  contributory cause of the present  unemployment.  We are so accustomed to pride  ourselves on the strength of  our credit and currency that we forget that they are based on very slender material resources as compared with thoseof other  countries, and that  our chief asset has been confidence.  That confidence isbeing shaken, and we must do everything we can to restore it.   The  emergency schemeof retirement pensions, bearing all the marks of an improvisation to meet  a passingproblem, would mean higher taxation and an increase in the number of non-producerssupported by the State, which would earn us little or no gratitude  and  open outavenues of attack from every side, both from those who thought our scheme profligate
2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        May 1,  1930.[20760]cand from those  who , regarded  it  as  inadequate.   Meanwhile,  an  insidiouscampaign  is  being  pursued  to  advocate  protection  as the  remedy for  ourpresent economic difficulties and to criticise, if not to deride, the programme of reconstruction  and  industrial efficiency  which  the  Lord Privy  Seal has  beenadvocating.  In these circumstances, what would be the effect  of a sudden reversal of  our present policy and the announcement that we were going to  embark on a:campaign of unrestricted expenditure financed out of loans, with its inevitable con-comitants of  special powers to coerce labour, landowners,  &amp;c, and its attempt to force capital  into unremunerative channels or to attract it. at the cost of subsequentincreases  in taxation ?  The combined  effect of all these factors, ably  fomentedby all the resources of political partisanship, might well be to  create a very  seriousshock to confidence not only in this country but abroad.  It is easy to imagine whata God-send it would be.to our opponents if we  were to  launch out on a policyof this kind, or, indeed, if  there appeared to be any serious element in the Govern-ment prepared to advocate such a policy.     It is, in  our opinion, clear that the only practicable course is to continue thepolicy of long-term reconstruction which the Lord Privy Seal has adopted  and tomake a definite and considered pronouncement that we reject retirement pensionsand the grandiose loan policy.    To sum up, the conclusions which we have to submit are that  -    (1) The Economic Advisory Council recently  set up was  carefully devised in          order to co-ordinate the policy of the Government on economic matters,          including unemployment, without overlapping with the  responsibilities          of the Ministers and Departments  directly concerned,  and, while  its          constitution must necessarily  be tested by experience, it would appear to          be the most appropriate organisation for this purpose.    (2) However much we may be criticised, we must not be rushed into shovelling          out public money merely for the purpose of taking what must inevitably          be a comparatively small number of people off the unemployed register to          do work which is no more remunerative and much more expensive even          than unemployment.    (3). The Government must be prepared to direct  itself to the application of          schemes  which  will not only  fulfil  the condition  that they provide          immediate employment, but which also stand the test of reducing the cost          of  production and adding to the economic power of  the country.    (4) Despite the temporary unfortunate results of intensive rationalisation, we          must  not  be  afraid  to  face  these  temporary  consequences.    The          Government has never admitted that  its  policy  must be  tested  by          immediate results.  We have always said that we have a well-thought-out          policy which must take time to develop.    (5) Both for political and financial reasons, we must do all we can to combat the          present feeling  of insecurity in our financial prospects, and we must,          therefore, avoid all  schemes involving heavy additions to Budget charges          or  grandiose loan expenditure.

                        THE  STATE AND RATIONALISATION.                           Note by Sir  Oswald Mosley.     AT  present  the  following  organisations  are  apparently  concerned  with Rationalisation :  (1) the Bank of England, operating through Securities, Limited, with a  research  organisation  attached under Professor  Henry  Clay;  (2) the Economic Advisory Council appointed by the present Government, Avhich is assisted by the present Government; (3) the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Department.     The Lord  Privy Seal informed me  that he had constituted two Committees to advise him on the process of Rationalisation : one of these Committees was composed of leading  industrialists and the other of representatives from  leading issuing houses.  He proposed to ask the latter body for financial assistance in the promotion of rationalisation schemes on  which he was engaged.  I know nothing of the detail work of any of these organisations as I  have not  been  present at their discussions, nor  have I  received  any minutes of  their conclusions.   I have only had one conversation with the Lord Privy Seal on the subject, when he read to me the  names of his two Advisory Committees, and my information on this subject may therefore be inaccurate and incomplete.     From the  available evidence it would appear that a  considerable  revision of these organisations is necessary if co-ordination  is to be  secured and overlapping prevented.  The only liaison of which I am aware rests in the Lord Privy Seal being a member of the Economic Advisory Council and holding  occasional consultations with the Governor of the Bank of England.  I am unaware of the existence of any systematic machinery of liaison or co-ordination, but my information may, of course, be incomplete.  If my information be correct, I submit that a co-ordinated machinery is necessary apart  altogether  from  any question of. principle  raised by the Government leaving the effective control  of industrial reorganisation in the hands of the Banks.  In an enterprise of this nature a case surely rests that the Government should assume effective control as well as responsibility, or  that, on  the other  hand, in the  absence of such control,  the Government should dissociate  itself  from responsibility.   The Manchester speech of the Lord Privy Seal and other utterances implied Government  initiative  in the process  of  Rationalisation and  Government responsibility, and we are in any case being held responsible for what is being done. But  in reality it would appear that effective control rests in the Banks and,  in the Bank of England in particular,  subject to occasional conferences  with  the Lord Privy Seal.     In my memorandum I argued that the British Banking system, unlike that of Germany, was  unequipped for such a task.  A further case  rests that the Central Bank, of all institutions, is the least  fitted for such an enterprise.   Setting  aside, however, all such arguments, I submit that another form of organisation is required (1) on  the grounds  of efficiency  and co-ordination, (2:) on  the grounds that the Government  should posses effective control if it assumes responsibility. Suggested  Organisation.     For this purpose  I suggest that  an organisation analogous  to  Securities, Limited, should be created to operate  under the auspices of the Government.  The relationship of the organisation to the Government would  be, broadly, the present relationship of Securities, Limited, to the Bank of England.   The Government  would hold a controlling interest,  but the Banks and  leading  issuing-houses would  be invited to participate.  The machine would be  served by a research  organisation of the  nature  that I suggested  in the  memorandum, acting  in co-operation  with Banking, Financial  and Commercial interests.   AU  resources of research and effective action, both Governmental and financial, would  thus be co-ordinated  in the one organisation.  In the  event of the Banks not desiring to participate  in all activities which the Government might  desire to promote,  the Government  might well take powers to proceed on lines similar to the old  Trade Facilities Act.  I am-aware of the case against that measure, but the suggested procedure would be in no way analogous to past procedure.  The defects of that instrument could be remedied by past experience obtained and by the far greater measure of expert assistance
370  ^APPENDIX  B.    Statement made by the Lord Privy Seal at Manchester, January 10, 1930.    IN considering the steps that might be taken to produce a better employmentposition by improving the organisation and  equipment of British industries, I have found that a feeling exists that manufacturers are handicapped in bringing aboutthe necessary reorganisation and re-equipment by the fact that the long-continuedtrade depression has pushed them  to the limits  of the credit which  they can reasonably expect to obtain from their bankers or which the bankers can reasonably be expected  to provide.    As a result of consultations I have had, I am now in a position to state that theCity is deeply interested in placing industry upon a broad and sound basis and readyto support any plans that in its opinion lead to  this end.   Those in the  City whohave been studying this matter are convinced that a number  of our  important industries must  be  fundamentally reorganised and modernised,  in order to be ableto produce at prices which will enable them to compete with the. world.    Industries which propose schemes  that, in the opinion of  those advising theCity, conform to this requirement will  receive the most sympathetic consideration and the co-operation of the  City in working out plans and finding  the necessaryfinance.    In the case of individual undertakings,  the City will be similarly ready to help,provided that the scheme under discussion fits in as part of the general plans forthe industry in question as a whole and gives reasonable promise that the changes will enable  the  undertaking to become an effective unit in  combination  andco-operation with other similar  undertakings.oavailable in the form of organisation now suggested.  Such questions as participation in profits of industries assisted and the general relationship between the Governmentand  those  industries would of  necessity be  matters of  detailed  consideration.Within these brief limits only the outline can be suggested, and, indeed, as I arguedin the memorandum, the details of a policy which involves the transition of Britainfrom a pre-war to a post-war industrial basis  requires intensive study with everyresource the Government can mobilise for the purpose. My main point was that nosuch study had been undertaken  and that, in  the absence of such study, only the broad outline of policy should be suggested.    I would venture  to advance  one other matter for consideration which shouldreally be the subject of  a separate paper.  If my thesis be in any way tenable that unemployment cannot be resolved merely by  Rationalisation of our basic trades, agreat necessity evidently exists for the promotion and encouragement of new trades.In this sphere we are confronted  by the hiatus  which exists in our  financial systembetween the short-term credit on collateral security and the long-term loan market.In Germany this gap is largely filled by their industrial banking system.  If it beof any interest to the Committee, I will develop a project to which I have devotedsome thought  for  an organisation  of  the nature suggested above undertaking theassistance of new industry and  invention in  addition  to  the Rationalisation ofexisting industry, and being assisted in such undertakings by an expanded organi-sation of scientific and industrial  research.  By some means or other we must  secure a mobilisation of the wrealth of scientific intelligence in this country for the capture of a leading position.    March 29, 1930.
