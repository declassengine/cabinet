Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1930.SECRET.                                                    Copy No.   38CP. 150 (30).CABINET.FRONTIER SETTLEMENT  IN  THE  MIDDLE-EAST.         MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.     THE frontier between Syria on the one hand and Iraq and Trans-Jordan  onthe  other  has for various reasons long  been in  dispute.   The Anglo-FrenchConvention of 1920  laid down a frontier, but this has proved  to be unworkablein practice  and  bears  little relation to  the de facto boundary  of  actualadministration.   For more than three years His Majesty&apos;s Government have  been pressing upon the French the  desirability of a conference to consider the revisionof the Convention frontier  and to  make arrangements for the  delimitation of the revised  frontier  on  the spot.  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador   in  Paris recentlysuggested, and the French Government have agreed, that it would be desirablethat this question should  be  discussed informally in Paris next  June, when theFrench  High Commissioner for Syria will be  available.   It  is proposed  that amember of  the  Foreign  Office,  accompanied  by a representative of  the iraqi government, together  with local  and other experts should go to Paris for thispurpose.  The Iraqi Government concur in this proposal and  I understand thatthe  Secretary of State  for Foreign  Affairs is  prepared to make  the  necessary arrangements.     I submit for  the consideration of my colleagues  that this  proposal  should  beauthorised, and that the British Delegation should be given discretion, if, as seems probable,  the  French  Government  prove  unwilling to negotiate  a  general settlement  of the  frontier   on  satisfactory  lines, to suggest  to the  FrenchGovernment that the whole matter should be referred by agreement to the  Leagueof Nations.     It is, I understand, the view of the Foreign Office that the French Governmentwould have great difficulty in resisting this suggestion.  Neither French norBritish  interests are directly  involved.   The territories concerned are  mandated territories and, theoretically at least, His Majesty&apos;s  Government and the FrenchGovernment are only interested in this  matter as trustees, anxious to do what is best  for the  territory under their charge  and responsible to the  League of nations for their actions.   It seems clear that, when a conflict of opinion has arisen on apoint of this nature,  the League itself is the body best qualified to  arbitrate.                                                                         P.     May 8, L930.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.
