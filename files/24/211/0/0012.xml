WASES  DISPUTE.                 Memorandum by the Minister of Labour&apos;.             ^SECRET.                                               COPY NO.....O.P.112(30).          1.   As  my colleagues  are  aware after there had been          failure  to reach a settlement  of the long protracted          dispute  arising from the employers1 proposal for a          reduction of wages, I  appointed Mr. Macmillan  (now          Lord Macmillan)  on 7th January to be a Court of Inquiry          under  the Industrial Courts Jict, having previously          obtained the approval  of both  sides of the Joint Industrial          Council  to his  appointment and to the terms of reference.          2.   The rates  of wages in the industry have not been          changed  (except  by sections of employers) since 1922, when          an  agreement provided  for  an addition of 10 per cent to          the base rates,  with oost  of living additions  of 72-g- per          cent to  time-workers and     to piece-workers, with lower          percentages to  Pressers and Blanket Raisers.          30   In  1925, when the employers proposed a reduction and          a stoppage of work occurred on the posting of  notices,          both sides agreed to accept the findings of a  Court of          Investigation.    The Court recommended that the existing          wages  should be  maintained for a period and the Joint          Industrial Council reached an  agreement on this basis,          which  was terminated on the application of the employers          in  November, 1927.   Since then there has been no agree-          ment operative  and the two sides have failed to agree up*n          a new  scale of  wages,
4.   In 1928 the unions joined in supporting an application(which was ultimately unsuccessful) for the  jafegu^ding of theDress Goods Trade and since that time negotiations on wages have proceeded.   At the end of the negotiations a tentativeproposal for a reduction of 7.25 per cent was made by theunions and the employers modified.their claim for a reductionof the base rate and the cost  of living percentage by an offer of a general reduction of 8,3 per.cent which was about half-way between the proposals of the two sides and was offered asa substitute for arbitration,   This was not accepted,&amp;..   Meantime a considerable number of employers had been ablewith or without stoppage of work, to put into operationreductions from 10 per cent downwards and I had hoped, by the                    -appointment of a Court of Inquiry, to provide a basis uponwhich both sides would be enabled to.reach a stable agreement.6..,   Lord Macmilla^s  report contained detailed conclusions,the main being the following proposals for reduction of wages     lime. Vforkers - Basis rate reduction of 5 per cent with                    cost of living addition 64$ instead of 72-g-.                    (Total about 9^$).     Piece Workers - Basis rate reduction of bfo with cost of                    living addition 56.32$ instead of 63f$.                                           -                    (Total about 8-M).     Considerable reductions were also proposed in the caseof juveniles.7.   The employers proposed an agreement embodying the above proposals with certain additions, but expressed their willingnesto negotiate modification in respect of the lowe.3*-paid women Inthe worsted spinning section.    The unions decided to refer thequestion to their members and the largest union, the National                                                     /Union
9.   A large meeting of employers  was  held on the 26th Marchand it was decided to post  wages reduction notices simultaneouslythroughout the industry to  come into operation  from the making-up day in the week ending 12th .April.,For accepting the employers&apos;  proposal  21.2$For rejecting the employers&apos;  proposal  72.1$HeutralUnion of Textile Workers, made the following statement inthe ballot paper     &quot;It is felt, however, that it is  not  opportune, at the      present time, to resist the proposals,  and  your      Executive Committee suggest, therefore, that if an      agreement could be made to cover all sections of the      industry, it would be  in the best  interests of your      members&quot;.8.   All the unions rejected the proposals and the followingresolutions were communicated to the employers at a meetingof the Joint Industrial Council on the  4th March:-     (1)  Resolved that the  proposal of the employers to          make a new agreement in accordance  with the          recommendations of the Macmillan Court  of Inquiry          as modified by the employers&apos;  suggestion, be and          is hereby rejected.     (2)  Resolved that the . employers  be informed that their          proposals have been rejected by  every trade union          which has taken a  ballot vote of its members, and          that the result of the aggregate vote be conveyed          to the employers as follows
10.  It is understood that  the  determination to  resist theproposals is particularly strong among the  highly  organisedOverlookers1 and craft unions  and that they are  in a positionto finance a prolonged dispute.   The Erade  Union congress general Council have appointed  a committee  to  give any assistance which may be possible.11.  Having used the only compulsory powers I  have., and havingregard to the position created  by the report of  Lord Macmillan,I cannot take any overt action  without endangering the whole system of reference to third party tribunals.    I  shall,however, keep&apos;in the closest touch with the situation and shallnot fail to do what is possible to avert the threatened dis-location of the industry.                          .
