CABINET.COMMITTEE  ON ALTERNATIVE WORK  IN ORDNANCE FACTORIES          AND SIMILAR  GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.                                   REPORT.      (CIRCULATED TO THE  CABINET BY DIRECTION  OF THE PRIME MINISTER.)To the Rt. Hon. Philip Snowden, M.P.,     Chancellor of the Exchequer.Sir,     1.  PURSUANT to Cabinet Conclusion No. 4 of the 12th February, 1930, an interdepartmental Committee was set up on your instruction with the followingmembership :          The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury  (Chairman);         The Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty;         The Permanent Under-Secretary of State,  War Office;         The Permanent Secretary of the Air Ministry;         The Controller of Establishments, Treasury;         The Permanent Secretary, General Post Office;         The Permanent Secretary, Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Department;         The Permanent Secretary, Office of Works.     While the Committee owes its origin to the memorandum of the 3rd February,1930, by the Secretary of State for War on &quot; Reductions at the Ordnance factories and similar Government manufacturing establishments &quot;  (OP. 35/30), we under -stand that we are required  to examine and report  to His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe general question of alternative work (i.e., work other than their normal work for defence purposes) in such Government establishments in all its aspects.     2.  The First Lord of the Admiralty has recently stated that in His Majesty&apos;sDockyards there is, even with the reduction which has been effected in the navy estimates  for  1930,  sufficient naval work*  to  keep  the existing workpeopleeconomically employed at least for the next twelve months, and we have, therefore,confined our detailed examination in the main to the Ordnance Factories, though thegeneral principles emerging  therefrom appear to us to apply to all  analogousGovernment establishments maintained for Defence purposes.     3.  Particulars of the Ordnance Factories and of  their  work  are  given inAppendix  A.   We understand that since our appointment steps have been taken to obviate the discharge of workpeople at  Woolwich by reducing the hours from47 to 43 4/12ths per week and by  special  diversion of normal work from tlhe trade.These steps are described in  Appendix B.  Proposals for  abolition of piece work(which would  have involved not only considerable  reduction in the earnings of the workpeople, but also an increase of approximately 20 per cent, in the cost of the workto the customers of the factories) were not pursued.    * An exception should be made in the case of Gibraltar Dockyard, where arrangements have been madeto reduce naval work but to fill up with work on repair of merchant ships.  The position there is very exceptional, as (1) the work is analogous to the naval work for which the Yard  is kept in being; (2) the yard is not in competition for the  commercial work with other  concerns, but is conveniently situated to-.undertake it.  The arrangements are still experimental.       [20973]                                                         B
     At Enfield the approved minimum or &quot; nucleus &apos;&apos; establishment^ with  whichhitherto peace strength (has practically coincided, has been reduced from 1,050 to920, to be reached mainly by normal wastage, and in the meantime piece-work hasbeen suspended, involving an increase in cost of the work of about 33 per cent. AtWaltham the necessity for fixing a  nucleus  has not yet  arisen, as the  numbers required for peace manufacture on a strictly economic basis are in excess of those atpresent employed.     4.  Before considering the  present proposals for the allocation of &quot; alternative work &quot; to Government factories in order to obviate discharges, we must briefly refer to the experiments in this direction which were made shortly after the Great War.Of these, the most notable was a scheme for the manufacture of 100 locomotives at woolwich Arsenal at an estimated cost of  1 million;  50 were, in fact, completed ata  cost  (including parts  of a  further 50 uncompleted) of  1,339,000,  and  afterconsiderable delay realised  281,000.   Features of this scheme were (1) that the work was not executed against definite orders and was done for a market the customers ofwhich are limited in number and in a good position, to hold off in order to secure areduction of price; (2) that it was work to which the factories were not accustomed;(3) that it was not asked for by the Factories, but was given to them by the  PrimeMinisters instruction;  (4)  that the  uneconomical  day-work system was  adopted.We understand that no one  now wishes to repeat experiments of this particular kind and that we  may  confine  our  attention  to  the  desirability  of allocating to the ordnance Factories part of the normal requirements of other Government Depart-ments and similar public bodies.     5.  The functions  of the Ordnance Factories are (1)  to manufacture Avarlikestorest in peace and war, (2) to provide a nucleus for expansion in emergency,  (3) tomaintain a check over trade prices,  (4) to provide for experimental manufactureoften of a secret nature.  These functions demand first that a nucleus establishmentbe kept at the Ordnance Factories irrespective of actual peace-time needs for warlike stores and secondly  (and of no less importance) that the efficiency of the  OrdnanceFactories for their proper purposes be kept as high as possible and the cost of their operations as low as possible,  subject to the maintenance  of  proper conditions ofservice  and to any unavoidable loss caused by the first condition.  It is  with thisview of the functions of the  Ordnance Factories that we have approached the problemof &quot; alternative work.&quot;     6.  It  follows  that  the first step  to be taken  in regard  to the  OrdnanceFactories is to make certain that the nucleus establishments  are fixed at  a minimumconsistent with emergency requirements.   We understand that  in 1923 there was arevaluation of the Ordnance Factories assets, and that the &quot;nucleus establishments &quot;were mainly fixed about the same time.  Since then, however, the ruling that defence expenditure is to be based on the unlikelihood of a Great War for at least ten years has been reaffirmed  in a much stronger form by dating the &quot;ten years&quot;  from any given moment.  The numbers of the  nucleus should therefore  now be reviewed inthe light of present conditions.  At  Enfield,  as  indicated in paragraph 3 above, a departmental review has already  just taken place, though  it is proposed that thenew nucleus of  920 should only be  reached  by normal wastage.   At Woolwich,however, numbers are still some 600 in excess even of the present nucleus establish-ments.  Appendices  C and D  give particulars  of  the  present  approved nucleusestablishments and of the fluctuations since 1914 in the numbers employed, the figuresfor His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards at home being  also given for  purposes of comparison.     It will  be seen that after a  rise in 1924--25 the numbers at  the Factories  fell in1926-27 but are  now slightly above the 1927  figure.  The last bulk discharges onreduction were made in 1925- and 1926, but such discharges have never been entirelysuspendedi  The figures for discharges on reduction (excluding lads) of recent years are:               1925     ...       ...       ...      ...       ...    1,065             1926     ...       ...       ...      ...       ...     459             1927     ...       ...       ...      ...       ...     101             1928     ...       ...       ...      ...       .-.       68             1929 (to 8th March, 1930) ...       ...       ...      43    * See Appendix C.    t See Appendix A for details of their present normal products.    % The statement  in paragraph 1 of CP. 35  (30) that &quot; compulsory discharges .... have for the last few years been entirely avoided &quot; is, we understand, incorrect.
     7.   The Ordnance Factories are not financed directly from Votes of Parliament (though a token  Vote is taken for them in order to secure proper control) but sell their products to the three  Service Departments and (through  the War Office)  to other public bodies, such as the India Store Department and the Crown Agents for the Colonies.  Though, however, to a certain extent in competition with the trade, their position is  essentially different:  the trade  quote a firm  price and are (theoretically, at any rate) subject to penalties for delay, rejected work, &amp;c, for which they  no doubt include a margin in their &apos;&apos; contingencies &quot;  item; the Ordnance Factories quote an estimate, but finally recoup themselves the actual cost (including cost of  delay, rejected work, &amp;c).     Ordnance Factories estimates of cost of orders are prepared by      (a) rate-fixing  operations  and determining man-hours,  thereby  determining           estimated wages costs;     (b) applying the appropriate &quot;Factory Expense &quot; by hourly machine-hour and           other  rates;     (c) valuing the material ;     (d) assigning a contingency factor. The customer is  charged actual  costs, as determined by the costing system, except that similar stores made on  different orders within the financial year are averaged before being charged out.  Work in progress is financed by cash advances from the Departments  on  whose behalf work  is ordered.  Capital expenditure is normally financed by  incomings from depreciation charged in the Revenue Account.     8.  It is of  interest to compare the Ordnance  Factories and the trade in the matter  of their working costs.    Examples of  working costs which the  Factories escape and the trade incur are rents of lands and buildings,  sales organisation, bad debts, cost of design, income tax (Schedule A).     In  addition,  the Ordnance Factories are relieved of the cost  of interest on their capital, which (as  written down in 1923) may  be put at  4 millions.*   The trade either incurs  interest charges on debentures or (more often)  aims  at a  profit  from which debenture  interest can be paid.     Moreover, the  Ordnance  Factories  receive a  special  &quot; subsidy,&quot;  at present amounting to  133,000 a year, charged to Service Department  Votes,  which goes some way towards meeting the cost of keeping up emergency plant on a scale larger in proportion to peace output than a trade firm aiming at commercial profit would be likely to  tolerate.     On the  other hand, the Ordnance Factories are subject to certain costs which the trade does  not have  to bear,  for example,  the &quot;Morris Award&quot;  ( 70,000 per annum), and leave with pay ( 19,000 per annum).     9.  The Ordnance Factories&apos; prices in certain lines which are congenial to them (especially  where  the items are  large individually or in total)  compare  not unfavourably with those of the trade.     In  other lines, outside the bigger items of their normal work on warlike stores which constitutes the bulk of their production, the Ordnance Factories&apos; prices are sometimes higher and sometimes lower than those of the trade.  But for &quot; alternative work &quot;  all the evidence, both from possible  customers and  from the Director of Ordnance Factories, is  that the  Ordnance Factories&apos; prices would, in  general, compare most unfavourably Avith those of the trade.   Broadly, this is because warlike stores are a high-class engineering job involving heavy overhead expenses, whereas the alternative work offered by civil departments is,  generally speaking, of a simple character such as can be done most economically by firms not burdened with heavy overheads.  In our view additional plant, alterations of existing plant and diversion of skilled effort required for &quot; alternative work &quot; would,  as a general rule, either involve  such capital expenditure as would make the cost  of a limited quantity of goods hopelessly high or (if the change-over were carried through to a degree that brought down costs of production to an economic level) might well defeat their ownobject, since the greater the extent of their adaptation to alternative work the moremight the Ordnance Factories be mifitted for what is after all their main objective the large-scale production of warlike stores in an emergency.    10.   Alternative work is foreign to the purposes of the Factories and could bejustified only if the men whom it is necessary to retain against  an emergency (i.e..                     * This also covers the cost of financing- production.    .  [20973]                                                       B 2
the nucleus) have not sufficient armament work to employ them in peace time.  even so, the &quot; alternative work&quot; would have to be  very  carefully selected, as  non-armament work which  is not more likely to impair than to maintain the reservearmament-producing capacity of the Ordnance Factories will be very hard to find.    While it may be right to use war machinery for peace purposes, it would be wrong to give peace work to the Ordnance Factories which would involve specialisedplant which  would be useless in war.   The  &quot; alternative &quot;  customer would also be embarrassed  in  an emergency when -the Ordnance Factories resumed their  properwork.    11.  We must  point out that the equipment of the Ordnance Factories for alternative work would be inconsistent with the general policy of  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in relation to the improvement of the industrial situation by means of rationalisation.   Such  policy favours  the reduction rather  than  the increase of competing  establishments, whereas  all plans  for giving alternative work  to the ordnance Factories  which have been brought to our notice  involve not the creationof fresh employment, but the diversion of orders from those best  suited to carry them out to a new and (for the purposes in question)  less  effective but more favouredcompetitor.    12.  Even the transfer of  more &quot;normal&quot;  armament  work to the OrdnanceFactories is  open to objection.  If it  is necessary to keep  a nucleus establishment at the Ordnance Factories in being against war,  it is equally necessary to keep thetrade capacity in being  against war, and, so far at any rate as the War Office orders are concerned, the balance has already been weighted very heavily this year in favourof the Ordnance Factories.  Further diversion of orders to the Ordnance Factoriesmight well raise in  an  acute form the question of subsidy* to  the trade for main-tenance of idle plant in the national interest, following what has already been  donein the case of armour plate for  warships.  Further objections are  the price factor,which for certain goods tells against the Ordnance Factories, and the rights of tradefirms as designers or patentees of the equipments purchased.    13.  We have,  in  addition to considering  &quot;alternative  work&quot; in general,examined in considerable  detail the possibilities  of such work being given to the ordnance Factories  by Departments of the Home  Government (General Post Office,Office of Works, &amp;c), and by other  Governments, and  we have also  taken detailedevidence from representatives of the Crown  Agents for the  Colonies and the HighCommissioner for India (India Store  Department).  The evidence is that there is little  prospect  of  orders, even if the Ordnance Factories&apos;  prices  were  heavily subsided by the taxpayer.    14.  A large amount of work has been examined, and such work as was in anyway suitable for the Ordnance Factories has been estimated for with the followingresults : Department.	(id Total Value at Trade Prices.	CO , Total Value at Ordnance Factories&apos; Estimated Price.	Percentage Increase of (c) over (6).	w Total Value of such work as the Factories estimate they could do at not more than 15 per cent. above Trade prices.I1.M. Stationery Office H.M. Office of Works General Post Office .. India Store Department	  123 &apos; 22.346 36,584 127,558	  146 29,164 81,236 181,000	19 30 122 42	  10,205 1,143 10,000It will be seen that the amount of work which could be undertaken at anything approaching an economic level is quite negligible in relation to the total earnings of the Factories, which are between  2 and  3 millions a year.    * There may of course already be an element of subsidy in some of the prices paid to Armament firms.
    We  received from the Crown Agents a list of orders exceeding   500 in valueplaced by them during February  1930.  These orders are small and very diverse,spread over some 80 firms, each, no doubt, best qualified to deal with  the particularorder.  For the Ordnance Factories to attempt to cut out these firms in their ownspecialities would be much resented, not only  by the manufacturers who would losetlie orders, but also by the workpeople who would lose the wages, and would probablyinvolve  uneconomical laying-down of  plant,  tools, &amp;c.  The total  of all  orders(including those  of   500 and under)  was 1,781, to a total  value of  397,033, anaverage of  225 per  order.  The orders over  500 ranged  from 5 locomotives costing 29,864 to marble work at  883, and included electrical work of all kinds, telephonecables, &amp;c.,.&amp;c.  For many of the articles drawings and patterns are held  by themakers, who,  in addition, are frequently protected  by  patents.  It  would be very bad business for the  Ordnance Factories to try to compete with firms for whom eachof these  orders is only  one of many similar orders.   Similar evidence, as regards&quot; alternative work,&quot;  was given on behalf of the India Store Department.    15.   If, after the nucleus has been reduced to the minimum, there should be ashortage of  normal work and &quot; alternative work &quot; has to be considered, it can onlybe on condition that the  Ordnance Factories should tender for such work as is available on the ordinary trade terms.   This will involve the quotation of firm pricesinstead of estimates, and also the  acceptance by the  Ordnance Factories of some, atany rate,  of the ordinary trade  risks.   It would not be right for the Civil Depart-ments to pay more for their goods by  reason of the  fact that for Defence purposesthey were ordered from the Ordnance Factories.    In  the  past,  Government  establishments have  generally  not been  allowed toundertake repayment work on  any basis other than that of repayment of cost, inview of the  danger of loss of public money, but we are satisfied that  the estimatingand costing  system of the Ordnance Factories is now on highly efficient and scientificlines, and that, provided there is no  interference  with it, there should be littlefinancial objection to the quotation of firm prices.   Such prices should, of course, beweighted to allow for the acceptance by the Ordnance  Factories  of the ordinarytrade risks in  regard  to delay, &amp;c.  In  fact,  already,  the  prices quoted  to non-Government*  customers for orders under  100  in value are firm figures  basedon estimated cost plus 10 per cent., Ordnance Factories (i.e., their normal customers)bearing any variation.     16.   We have carefully considered the suggestion in  CP.  35 (30) that it mightnot be necessary to load such fixed prices with the whole of the  overhead expenseswhich on a strict cost-accounting basis might  be chargeable to  the orders, and that,if Government Factories undertake work to which they have not been accustomed,it must be assumed that a reasonable time must be accorded them to adapt themselves.     As  we have pointed  out, work  &quot; to  which  the  Factories have  not  been accustomed  &quot;  is unlikely to help them in preserving nucleus capacity for war.  Forinstance,  rifle-making  is  a skilled craft, and  it is therefore necessary to retain atEnfield  a certain minimum number  of men  exercising  this craft;  but while it ispossible  to  conceive of  alternative  work  which would help,  the  manufacture ofpostmen&apos;s bags or milk churns at Enfield will do nothing to preserve the rifle-makingcraft.    17.   It may, however, be  argued that  if, even after revision,  the nucleusestablishment  at the Ordnance Factories is greater  than is required for the  peaceorders for warlike stores, and it is necessary to employ men on Avork which is nottheir  normal work but is as near it as to make no difference, then some reduction inon-costs for the purpose of quoting firm prices might be made in respect of such itemsas might properly be regarded *as  standing charges.    18.  An examination of the on-costs at the Ordnance Factories shows, however,that any reduction which could be made on this account is not very large and wouldnot make any appreciable difference in the amount of work  which the Factorieswould be likely to secure in competition with the trade.  We have  taken detailedevidence on this point and find that, if &apos;,&apos; standing  charges &quot;  are construed  in the sense that certain expenses! have to be incurred in full and certain other expenses!are subject to slight diminution only, irrespective of the total load of work, the effectof excluding  such charges from  the  cost of alternative work would be to reduce                  * Supply to such customers is, of course very rare indeed.                  t Details in Appendix B.
Factory Expense by 32 per cent., to reduce the percentage of Factory Expense on Direct Labour by 53 per cent.,  and to reduce the cost of the work by 15 per cent.These average percentages are, it is true,  not necessarily a safe guide in dealing withparticular cases, since the incidence of  standing charges varies greatly, probablyfrom 5 to 20 per cent, as between one shop and another.     19.   In any event,  however, we  should view with apprehension any schemewhich concealed the loss on alternative work, even though it might be contended thatsome small portion of the loss is in respect of- expenditure arising out of &quot; standingcharges &apos;&apos; as defined above  On-costs  are as  much a part  of true costs  as direct labour and material, and no arrangement  which obscures this truth should be adopted.Alternative work should  be costed in precisely the same manner as  normal work;any loss or profit thereon should be charged to a special account and not loaded onto  normal products, as  this would vitiate comparison with trade  prices.   Byfollowing this method the outcome of the special account would be clearly availablefor the information of Parliament and fully controlled.     20.   We wish to add that we are  very favourably impressed by the  presentefficiency  of the Ordnance Factories&apos; management;  our  objections to &quot;alternative work &apos;&apos; are not based on any of the stock-in-trade criticisms of Government establish-ments but are in  reality  a tribute to the Ordnance Factories&apos; efficiency for their proper purpose.   It is because the Ordnance Factories are adapted for the manufac-ture of certain types of defence stores,  and  for expansion in war-time, that their employment on other work would be wrong and uneconomical.   The requirements ofthe  nucleus  render  the  Ordnance Factories&apos; labour immobile and  prevent othereconomical arrangements, such  as  the employment of female labour in peace;  thenecessity of organising for rapid expansion in war spreads the  personnel over a large area in peace and adds to the cost of many maintenance  services.  If the danger ofwar against which the Ordnance Factories exist can be neglected, then the OrdnanceFactories have no justification for existence as such; but, if not, they should continueto be organised for war purposes and all steps which would weaken them should be avoided.     21:   Our recommendations  may be  summarised as follows : -     (1) The function of the Ordnance Factories is to manufacture certain warlike           stores in peace-time and to be  ready to expand to meet war requirements;           and any suggestions  for &quot; alternative work &quot; should be considered with           this function in view.     (2) The  &apos;&apos; nucleus &apos;&apos; establishment of work-people should be reviewed in the           light of present military requirements.     (3) In view of (1)  &quot;alternative  work&quot;  can be justified,  if at all, only when          normal work  is  insufficient  for the nucleus under (2),  to which  the          Ordnance Factories should be reduced as soon as possible.     (4) Subject to the above,  alternative work  should be undertaken only where it          helps to maintain and not to  impair emergency capacity, and only when          all possibility of economical transfer of normal work from the trade has          been exhausted.  But the problem of  &quot;nucleus  capacity&quot; arises in  the          trade also  and must be faced.     (5) Alternative work should be undertaken only with definite orders in sight.          A repetition of the locomotives fiasco of 1921 should be avoided.     (6) Alternative work should be undertaken only  when it can be done by  the          Ordnance Factories at reasonable cost.  The  diversion to  the Ordnance          Factories of work which they can do only at disproportionate cost or by          installing  extensive  plant is  not only expensive  to the  taxpayer  and          detrimental to the true  purpose of the Factories, but is contraryto  the          general  policy of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  in  the   direction  of          rationalisation and amalgamation of industries.     (7) Detailed  examination of the capacity  of  the  Ordnance Factories  and  the          requirements of public Departments show that very little  in the way of          suitable &quot;alternative work&quot;  is in fact available.     (8) The evidence shows that the prospects of attracting  more normal work to          the Ordnance Factories would be improved if  they were put m a position          to quote &quot;firm prices.&quot;  We  see no objection to this, provided  that  the          full cost  were recovered on  the  average,  in the  case of  Government          customers not financed from Votes of Parliament.
 (9) If &quot;alternative work&quot; became necessary,  the adoption of &quot;firm prices&quot;       would also help the Ordnance  Factories to secure such orders as were       available.(10) Alternative work should be costed in precisely the same way as other work.       This is essential to the continued efficiency of the Ordnance Factories and       to proper comparison of their prices with those of the trade.   Any loss1       (see (11)  below) should be  specially recorded for  the information of       Parliament and not absorbed in prices for normal work.(11) With regard to the suggestion that prices for alternative work might fairly       be abated in respect of &quot; standing charges,&quot; we find that a fair abatement       from cost which might be made in this respect would be, on an average,       15  per cent.  Even  with this abatement,  the Ordnance Factories cannot       usually compete for  &quot;alternative work&quot; on an economic basis.(12) The unsuitability of the Ordnance Factories for alternative work is not due       to inefficiency on their part, but arises from their special circumstances       and from their efficiency for their  proper function.

I. WOOLWICH.    1.  The following is a. statement of Work Requirements, assuming (a) a 47-hour week  and (b) a 43-4/12 hour week of work available on normal bases of allocation,and of resulting deficit or surplus at the two Woolwich Factories.Factory. (1)	Requirements.		Normally Available.			Deficit or Surplus (rounded).		47 hours. (2)	43-4/12ths hours. (3)	From Navy, Air Force, India, &amp;c. (4)	Army. All Votes. (5)	Total. (6)	47 hours. (7)	43-4/12ths hours. (8)Royal Gun and Carriage Factory Royal Ammunition and Filling Factory	  648,000 1,072,000	  605,000 1.003,000	  266,750 696,450	  289,500 329,000	  556,250 1,025,000	  - 92,000 - 47,000	.   - 49,000 4- 22,000    2.  &quot; Normal &quot; allocation is based on suitability of the work for the OrdnanceFactories, and the necessity of maintaining Trade capacity for war, considerations of price and delivery, of obligations to Trade, whether  contractual or otherwise,,including &quot; Fair Share &quot; agreements, of patent rights of Trade firms.
     3.  The Department has decided that the deficit of  49,000 in orders for theRoyal Gun and Carriage Factory on  a week of 43-4/12 hours  can be met by trans-ferring to the Ordnance Factories orders to  that value, which, under  normalallocation &quot; methods would have  been  given  to the  Trade.   The disadvantagesattendant upon  this abandonment of  the principle of  normal allocations  (seeparagraph 2 above) are accepted.     4.  There are strong objections,  sometimes because of Trade contract, rights,or the necessity of preserving Trade capacity, sometimes also on grounds of disparityof price, to any. further departure from the normal  principles of allocation.     5.  As  regards the Royal Ammunition and Filling Factory, it will be seenthat the requirements for a week of 43-4/12  hours can be satisfied without  any&quot; abnormal &quot; allocation to them of work which the  Trade,  for the reasons given inparagraph 2, are better fitted to do&apos;.     6.  Regarding Army as responsible  for finding the balance of work needed tokeep the two Factories employed on the 43 4/12ths hour basis,  the amounts requiredfor this purpose,  on the figures in paragraph 1  above, are      Royal Gun and Carriage Factory                                                                             Sum of Columns (5) and (8)     ...      ...    289,500                                                      49,000     338,500     Royal Ammunition and Filling Factory                                                                             .

Reasons for Trade Allocation.    (i.) Gun Ammunition,  34,000.- Not required for Ordnance Factories on the43 4/12ths hours basis, but, in any case,  2,000 is required to meet carry-over,  i,e.,orders already placed but not yet completed.    (ii.)  Small Arm Ammunition,  50,000. Not required for Ordnance Factorieson the 43 4/12ths hours basis, but, in any case,  44,000 is required to meet carry-       [20973]                                                          c
over.   The remainder comprises ammunition and  accessories not suitable for the ordnance Factories.    (iii.)  Guns and Carriages,  97,540. Carry-over requires  77,000; the balanceoptical and experimental stores.  The Department relies  to a  considerable  extentupon  the  experience of Messrs. Vickers  Armstrong in the matter of  experimentaldesigns of Ordnance.  The Ordnance Factories are not  equipped to undertakeOptical work.    (iv.) Small  Arms,   20,400. Carry-over requires   12,000; the  remainder  isfor optical  stores and for bicycle  parts, neither of which are suitable for the factories.             &apos;    (v.) Tracked and half-tracked vehicles and ar&apos;moured cars,  163,350. Carry-over requires  65,000.  The remainder comprises chassis engines and parts of Tradepattern armoured cars (Lanchester and Rolls Royce), of Kegresse-type vehicles madeby  Crossley,  Citroen  and Burford, the most  important component of which  isimported from France, of light tanks (Vickers-Armstrong), of which the department has not the right of user.  It also comprises special air-cooled tank engines, whichare of Armstrong Siddeley&apos;s design  and manufacture, and spare parts for tanks  toVickers&apos; design  in respect of which  the Department has recognised the firm&apos;s rightto a fair share.    (vi.)  Wheeled  Vehicles,   172,650. Carry-over requires   10,000.   includes provision  for Trade pattern of lorries, motor-cars and motor-cycles and their spares.    (vii.)  Engineer  and  Signal  Stores,   67,500.-Carry-over  requires   15,000.The remainder  covers  provision and maintenance of  Searchlights,  electrical and scientific stores not suitable to Ordnance Factories.    (viii.) Anti-Gas   Stores,    35,400. Carry-over  requires   10,000.    Theremainder is for the purchase of components for respirators and for their assembly at the factory at Leyland;  and partly for the purchase of chemicals  and charcoal.This work is not suitable for the factories.8.  Comparison of Prices.    Ordnance  Factories&apos; prices  compare favourably  with those of the Trade inregard to those articles the manufacture of Which is the main object of the Factories,e.g., guns, breech mechanisms, mountings, ammunition, and similar armament stores,and also for complete tanks.    For Tank spares, Ordnance Factories&apos; prices differ from those of the Trade to avery variable extent.   For a few components  they are definitely  cheaper, for aconsiderable number  their prices are not more than  10 per cent, in excess of theTrade, but for many the excess, particularly in comparison with small firms, is veryconsiderable, amounting in some cases to more than 100 per cent.    Armoured Cars and Tractors in the present experimental stage are for the mostpart special to Trade  firms.    For motor vehicles of the ordinary commercial type it  is obvious that the ordnance Factories cannot compete in price.    For ammunition  boxes (which are metal lined) Ordnance Factories&apos;  prices vary from slightly less than  the Trade to 15 per  cent, above.   For fuse and projectileboxes (plain wood) prices run from 10 per cent, below to 15 per cent, above the Trade.For fitted boxes they are very considerably cheaper than the Trade.    For packing cases of an ordinary type prices vary from being level with theTrade to 70 per cent,  or 80 per cent, above.    For barrack tables (deal,  metal bound) Ordnance Factories are cheaper than theTrade.    For small tin cylinders, Ordnance Factories&apos; prices are about 100 per cent, above those of the Trade.     As  regards delivery,  the Ordnance Factories&apos;  necessity for spreading ordersover the whole year  may  sometimes militate against speedy delivery in the earlyportion of the year.     9.   It has just been decided by Ministers that, with effect from the 7th April, 1930, the Ordnance Factories at Woolwich shall work on the basis  of a 43 4/12thshours week.
