Memorandum by the Chancellor of  the Exchequer.             1.  The Memorandum by the  Minister  of Agriculture        (CP.  135(30))  reaches a  conclusion  in favour of  a Statutory        Quota  of British Wheat in Flour which Is based  on the  premiss        that It  is desirable  to  stimulate cereal growing  in this  country.             2.   I am not  prepared to  agree  that the  Government  should        commit themselves  to  either  the premiss  or the  conclusion of        the Minister of Agriculture.             3.   The stimulation of  cereal growing by artificial  means        is in my view  a very doubtful proposition.   It was definitely        rejected by the last Government in their White  Paper on        Agricultural Policy in February 1926 (Cmd.2581) in which they        stated that &quot;it will probably be better business for the  British        farmer to devote his energies as largely as possible to  the        livestock Industry and to aim at meeting the demands of  the        population for meat and milk&quot;.             4.  If we are to reverse this policy and to commit        ourselves to the proposition that wheat  growing  (which only        amounts to 5 per cent of the total agricultural output)  must        be made profitable, TO shall Inevitably be driven to the necessity                                                                         j        of subsidies on a large scale, which  cannot be confined to wheat \                                                                         h        and will certainly have to be extended to oats.   The authorities.&apos;        to which the Minister of Agriculture appeals, viz. the Selborne  g        Committee of 1917 and tho Agricultural Tribunal both agreed that        cereal cultivation could not be  Increased without a subsidy.
     5.   Moreover at the request of the Minister ofAgriculture himself, the Economic Advisory Council has just set up a Committee to consider the vfciole agriculturalproblem, and it would surely be unwise to commit ourselves to the policy of stimulating cereal growing by artificialmeans till that Committee has reported.     6.  Even if I  could be &quot;persuaded,  that so^e measures arenecessary  to arr$st a further decline  in cereal cultivation.,I should in any case be strongly opposed to the methodsuggested  by the Minister of Agriculture of a StatutoryQuota of British &quot;wheat  in Flour, which in my opinion  is wrong in principle, is open  to  serious Parliamentary  andadministrative objections and  is quite likely to  proveineffective.     7.  The object of  the  proposal Is to raise artificiallythe  price  of British wheat-,and It  cannot be  denied that,  tothe  extent to which it  is successful,  it must affect  the  costof  the  loaf  and  consequently tond  to depress real wages.    Itis based on  the  same assumption vhich underlies  the proposals made from  other  quarters  for currency Inflation or for  fiscalprotection,  namely that the remedy for our  industrial troubles is  not  increased efficiency but reduced wages;      8.  To such conceptions I am unalterably  opposed,and I  am not prepared  to commit myself to  the  proposition that because&apos; wheat growing may not be profitable  In this  country under  present  conditions it is our duty to  make it profitableby: raising its  price artificially at  the expense  of consumers.
9.  But apart from this objection in principle I havegrave doubts whether the proposal will be either effective orworkable,  and the he difficulties of passing the necessary legislation throughParliamerit are very formidable.10. The Minister of Agriculturere sets out two alternative methods for the operation of the quota, and he proposes.apparently to ask Parliament to give him a free hand to adopteither method by executive action, and to fix and vary the quota percentage without any Parliamentary control.   Is there any prospect that Parliament would willingly ha   over to any minister such far reaching powers affecting a vital necessityof every-day life?   It  would be denounced as an  outrageousInstance of bureaucratic domination,  and  safeguards wouldbe demandod in numerous directions  to protect  the  interests, ofthe various parties  concerned  from  being  exploited.      11. I observe  also that  simultaneous  legislation by the parliament of Northern  Ireland is regarded  as  essential  andthat,  In  spite of  the fact that  our legislative  programme for this year Is already overloaded,  it  Is  suggested  thatthe whole  of the necessary legislation,  including  apparentlythe Agricultural Marketing Bill,  must be  passed  Into  law before  tho Summer Recess, so  that  the scheme can be putinto  operation in  the Autumn.      12. Even apart  from the  difficulty of  tho  time-table,it is  certain that  there will  be  vigorous  opposition  to either  of  the two alternative  methods by  several of theInterests  affected.   It Is admitted  that the  first methodis. strongly objected to by the Flour  Importers,  the English
factor:/ bakers and the Scottish bakers.   Their objections are supported by the Canadian Milling Industry, who are greatlyalarmed at the proposal and have addressed violent protests tothe Canadian Government oh the subject.   We have been told that If this method is adopted the Canadian Government mighthave to abandon a number of valuable concessions the&apos;?&apos; propose&apos;to give to British imports.   It is probable also that theAustralian Flour exporters will be equally hostile.     13. On the other hand the second  method Is  inacceptableto the powerful milling industry In this  countr   and without their, support and co-operation any scheme  will  be verydifficult to work.     14. It is  clear, therefore,  that  either method  willexcite active opposition,  vhich will greatly increase  thedifficulty  of passing the necessar:/ legislation.     15. Even if  all  these difficulties  could  be  surmountedI  am not satisfied  that the  scheme would work  satisfactorily,or that  the benefit  intended  to be given to  the  farmers would.not be  intercepted  by the  merchants  or some  other interest.The difficult:/  of fixing  the  quota percentage  in advance  at  a figure  which  is neither too  high  nor  too low will be very great.If it  Is fixed  too  high  the  quota wheat  will not be  obtainableat every time  and place where it  Is  wanted and there will belocal  shortages and holding  up of business.    If it  is fixedtoo  low, it will  have little  or no effect and the farmers willbe loud in  their  complaints.    The Committee  which Is  toadvise  the  Minister in  the matter will be composed of                                -4-

t 43 5many divergent interests all pulling in differentdirections, but the Government will have to take theresponsibility and bear the blame for any faulty decision.If the scheme does not succeed in raising the price ofBritish wheat materially, we shall have committed ourselves to finding some other method of securing that resultand we may be driven to something even more objectionable.If the scheme is successful, we shall be pressed to applysimilar action to other crops which may be unprofitable,and what answer shall we have to requests for somecorresponding measure of assistance to other depressedindustries,.     16.  Finally, there is the special difficulty ofScotland.  . It is admitted that the scheme would be of little value to the Scottish farmer, and it is highlyunpopular with the Scottish bakers, who believe that itwould affect detrimentally the quality ox the bread theirconsumers want.   They suggest that the only condition onwhich it could be acceptable to Scotland would be thattheir quota percentage should be only one half of thatfixeu for England and Wales, which would be administrativelyimpracticable without establishing a Customs landfrontier for all wheat and flour crossing the border.Moreover,  the. Secretary of State for Scotland points outquite reasonably that if the wheat quota scheme is adoptedhe would have to press for protection for the Scottishgrower of  oats by prohibition of imports or by counter-vailing duties, either of which would raise most serious difficulties in connection with our commercial treaties
and the recent Geneva Tariff Truce.     17.   My conclusion is therefore that the proposedWheat quota has little to commend it, that it would commit us to a false principle which might prove mostembarrassing, and that we should be wise to have nothing to do with it.
