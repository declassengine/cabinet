CABINET               UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY:  DEVELOPMENT WORKS.                   MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD PRIVY SEAL.1,        I am circulating herewith in a handy form for theinformation of the Cabinet a statement setting out, as at31st March, approvals of works of development to be undertaken with State assistance.   As will be seen material progress hasbeen made in the approval of schemes for grant since the issueof the last White Paper (Cd. 3519).   There are still a numberof very important schemes under consideration and applicationsfor assistance under the Development Acts continue to flow insteadily.   The total value of schemes approved is alreadyapproaching  100 million.   I hope to see some expansion of theprogramme when the Land Drainage Bills now before Parliamentbecome law,   in looking at this programme it must be rememberedthat the State has been steadily financing a large programme of telephone development over several years amounting to more than 10 millions a year;  that it has undertaken a forestry programmeamounting to  9 million spread over a period of years; and that both the State and Local Authorities will shortly have to under-take very heavy commitments to implement the Housing Bills now before Parliament, in addition to the housing programme beingcarried out under the Wheat ley Act on the present subsidy.   Allthese works are works of  national development.2*       I should like to lay stress  on certain points inconnection with this programme.   We have been criticised for not adopting a more comprehensive policy to deal with theimmediate future.   m so far as this criticism has taken
18 5 jJSfr-definite shape it has been concentrated largely  on  the  fact  thatwe hare not financed our programme of work by the issue of alarge Development Loan.   Such criticism seems to be  based onthe ground that there ia some inherent virtue in the  action  of raising a State loan.   I dissent strongly from  such  a  view.-.   the true measure of the success of a policy of development  Is not theamount of money raised to finance a hypothetical programme butthe amount of work which can actually be put in  hand  to give aneconomic return,   By this test our policy will  answer  criticism from any quarter.  (l am not of course concerned here with thoseadvocates of a loan policy, and they are probably more  numerousthan is realised, whose real motive is an indirect  attack on our financial policy or a desire to bring about an indirect reductionin real wages by Inflation.   Nor do I wish to enlarge  upon  theeffect of a large State loan upon the chances of conversion  ofpart of the War Loan debt to a less oppresive level).3.       The advocates of the large loan postulate  the  failureof efforts to set in motion a programme of works on the linesat present being followed.   But the simple fact that our programme is already nearing the  100 million point (and thatin 10 months of office) and is expanding steadily is  asufficient answer to this.   It is extremely doubtful whether one additional man would be at work cm State-assisted schemes  to-day had we raised a loan in advance of our needs.   Our critics  onthis score overlook the further point that our present  policy isitself a loan policy in the sense that, apart from roads,practically the whole of the programme Will be financed byborrowings  It is true that money is raised only as it  isrequired for works which have been examined and  approved and which will be started at a reasonably early  date;
  but the alternative of first raising  a great Development Loan. and than looking for ways of spending this  easily  acquired wealth has really nothing to Commend it.    The  size  of  the programme is determined primarily by (l)  the extent of the useful schemes which can  be started on a reasonably economic basis (2)  the physical difficulties of  planning  and putting into operation the large schemes of development which  are really worth while  in an already highly  developed country like Great Britain.          There  is a final point.   Practical experience of carrying out a  policy of development works shows  clearly how small a contribution even very large programmes of public works can make  towards  an appreciable  reduction of the Live Register,    &quot;work is now under way on schemes under the Home Development  Act  alone,  and excluding roads, costing some  16 million.   On these works  there are probably some 15,000 to 20 ,000  persons  directly  employed.   This figure will rise appreciably  later .in the  year.    But a  few weeks  of depression in Lancashire are  sufficient  to throw on to the register numbers which completely  obscure  any contribution which a programme  of  development  works may make.   And tens of thousands  of  such workers  are beyond reach of relief through such  works.   It  is not normally  possible  to concentrate major works into a  short  period  of  time.   As an illustration of this  one of the largest single&apos; schemes  approved, and probably the most valuable from a national point of view is that for the standardisation of frequency  in the North Last of England at a  cost of  10 million.   The work under this  scheme willbe spread over five years and I am satisfied that  it  would be folly to attempt materially to reduce this period.   Theperiod over which large works of development must  inevitably
      &quot;be spread is a factor which has  not  been sufficiently taken      into account in assessing the  employment value  of public  works.5.               I do not  suggest in  the  light  of the  foregoing  that      there should be any contraction in  our development programme.      On the contrary I am  working for steady  expansion along      lines consistent with the more important aspect of our policy&apos;  -      the improvement of  our industrial  and commercial efficiency.      I  am circulating this  note because I  think that the  facts      as to the progress  already made  are  themselves  an answer  to      those of our  critics  who  suggest that  we are doing nothing      to provide  useful employment and they  may be useful  to my      colleagues  in  rebutting criticism on this  score.   At  the      same  time the  fact  that such progress  can  go hand- in hand      with  a  rapidly  rising Live Register  indicates how small      a  contribution  development works even  on the largest scale      can be  expected  to make to the reduction of the Live Register.
