THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for. the Cabinet.  March 1930.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.    35CP.  109  (30).CABINET.PALESTINE.         MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR THE COLONIES.     I CIRCULATE for the  consideration  of  my  colleagues  (1)  a statement summarising the findings of  the Commission on the  Palestine  disturbances,  and (2) a memorandum, prepared in the Colonial Office, discussing past and future policy in the country.     I will offer only a few brief comments at this stage.     I start  from the assumption (1) that  the Mandate for Palestine and the policy on which it is based are to be maintained;  and (2) that some fresh pronouncement will have to be made as to the lines along which this policy is to be conducted in the future.     As regards (1),  the  High  Commissioner, as will be seen from the despatch which I am circulating separately, recommends drastic amendment of the Mandate itself.  I do not support his recommendation in this respect.  The objections  to a revision of the actual terms of the Mandate seem to me insuperable.  On the other hand, I recognise the need for a fresh pronouncement as to the lines  on which future policy is to be conducted.  But the question arises, when, and at what stage, such a pronouncement  is  to be  made.  Two  possible alternatives  suggest  themselves. Firstly, a new  Commission might be appointed (whether in the form  of a Royal Commission, or of  an  individual  in whom  we could  repose  great  confidence, or  of a  body  representing  the League  of Nations)  to  examine  and   report upon major  questions of policy.  (This, it will  be remembered,  was the  course suggested not long ago in a letter published in the &quot; Times &quot;  over the signatures of the late Lord Balfour, Mr. Lloyd George and General Smuts.)  This course would inevitably entail delay, as no  pronouncement  could be made until  the Commission had  reported.  Alternatively,  the new  pronouncement  might be  framed  by the Government  forthwith,  in the  light of  the  material already available, without recourse to further special investigation.     This is the first point upon which a decision is required.     If we are to dispense with further enquiry (as I am disposed to think that weshould) and to proceed at once to questions of policy, there are three main points thatcall for early consideration, viz. :      (1)  the  Arab demand for some, form of representative institutions;     (2)  the  regulation of immigration;  and     (3)  the  protection of evicted cultivators.     In regard to these three points, I have not much to add, at the present stage, tothe suggestions made in the Colonial Office memorandum.  As to (1), I am satisfiedthat the demand for representation cannot  be wholly ignored; but whether the betterway  of meeting  it is to  set up a Legislative  Council (with  or without an  officialmajority), or to revive the proposal 01 1923  for  the  creation of  a  special Arab&quot; Agency,&quot; with functions analogous to those of the Jewish Agency, seems an openquestion.  If a  Legislative Council were set up, its  powers could be only of a      [20840]                                                         B
restricted character;  the circumstances of Palestine  are not suited  to  any large measure of self-government.   Before coming  to a final decision on this, we oughtto consult representative Jews and Arabs, who are now in London.    As to (2), not only must we provide against over-immigration,  such as occurred in: 1925-26, but we are also bound,  I think,  to provide  some machineryi by-whichArabs, as well as Jews, would have their say on questions of immigration as they arise  from time to time.   The precise nature of such machinery is  a  matter fordiscussion.  Some form of consultative Committee, whether or not on the particularlines proposed in 1922, might be the best plan.  In  any case, the1 last word1 should,in my opinion, rest with the Government, whose decision on all matters relating toimmigration  must be final.    As  to (3),  the High Commissioner  is  already  framing  legislation  for theprotection of the evicted tenant.   It will  probably take the form of prohibiting allsales of  land, involving  the disturbance  of Arab cultivators, without the explicitconsent of the Government; but I am still awaiting a further communication  fromSir John Chancellor on the subject.                                                                         - PColonial Office, March 27, 1930.
APPENDIX 1.                    SUMMARY OF SHAW  COMMISSION REPORT.    THE Commission was appointed in September  1929 to &quot;enquire into theimmediate  causes  which  led to  the recent  outbreak in Palestine and to make recommendations as to the steps necessary to  avoid a recurrence.&quot;    It consisted of the following members :-                                  ;  :             Sir Walter Shaw (Chairman).             Sir Henry Betterton, Bt., M.P.             Mr. R.  Hopkin Morris, M.P.             Mr. H.  Snell, M.P.    The following is a summary of the Commission^ principal conclusions andrecommendations.              (A.)- General conclusions on more important matters.    1.  The outbreak was, from the beginning, an attack by Arabs upon Jews, forwhich no excuse has been established. In the few instances in which Jews attackedArabs their action was, for the most part, in the nature of retaliation.  The outbreakwas not premeditated, and the charges brought against the  Grand Mufti  and thePalestine  Arab  Executive of.  deliberately  organising disturbances have  not been.proved. The outbreak neither was nor was intended  to be a revolt against Britishauthority in Palestine.    2.  The Commission offer no serious  criticism  of the action taken by thePalestine Government either immediately before the outbreak or after it had takenplace.  On the general question of policy, they consider that the Government have in the past discharged, to the best of their  ability, the difficult task of maintaining a neutral and impartial attitude between two peoples whose leaders have shown littlecapacity for compromise.    3.  The Commission hold that Jewish enterprise and immigration, when  not inexcess of the absorptive capacity of the country, have  conferred material benefits on palestine in which the Arabs share.  They  consider,  however, that, as regards thelimits to be imposed  on immigration, there has been a departure by the Jewishauthorities  from the doctrine  laid down  in 1922  and accepted  by the zionist organisation at the time; and that claims  advanced on the Zionist side have beensuch as to arouse Arab apprehensions of ultimate loss of livelihood and of politicalsubjection.    4.  The Commission call attention to a number of  cases in which, on  the saleof land, Arab  cultivators were evicted without the provision of other land for their occupation.  They do not criticise the part played by Jewish land companies in these transactions.  The Companies paid compensation m certain  cases and were actingwith the knowledge of the Government; but an acute situation has been producedand a landless and discontented class is being created, which is a potential danger to the country.   They urge that  some remedy for the  situation should be found.Their  conclusion  is  that Palestine cannot  support  an  increased, agricultural population without a radical change in the  methods of  farming.    5.  They,  believe  that the  difficulties, of the. Palestine  Government are  beingaggravated  by the resentment felt among the Arabs  at  their continued failure toobtain any measure of self-government.  .    6.  The Commission.call attention to certain difficulties inherent in the balfour declaration and  the Mandate,  and refer to the resentment felt by the Arabs athaving (unlike the Jews) no regular means  of direct access to the Government. -    7.  They  consider that  the policy of reducing the  Garrison in Palestine and transjordan-Jordan  was carried too far.                         (B.) Causes of  the outbreak.    In the opinion of the Commission the  fundamental cause of the outbreak wasthe Arab feeling of animosity and hostility towards the Jews consequent upon thedisappointment  of  their  political and national aspirations, and  fear  for   their economic future.[20840]
                       (C^-Principal Recommendations.     1.  The primary recommendation of the Commission is that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should issue a clear statement of policy, with the least possible delay,and should make it plain that they intend to give full effect to that policy with allthe resources at their command.  The value of such a statement would be greatlyenhanced  (a) if it contained a clear definition of the meaning attached by  HisMajesty&apos;s Government to the passages in  the Mandate safeguarding  the  rights ofnon-Jewish communities, and (b) if it laid down, for the guidance of  the  palestine government, more explicit directions as to  the conduct of policy on vital  issues, suchas land and immigration.  Recommendations on these subjects are largely based onthe assumption that the proposed definition of policy will contain a clear statement to the effect that the rights and position of non-Jewish communities are to be fully safaguarded.    2.  The Commission recommend  that a clear  statement should  be issued of future policy with regard to the control of Jewish immigration,  and that adminis-trative machinery should be reviewed  Avith the object of preventing a repetition ofthe excessive immigration of 1925-26.  Pending the introduction of some form of representative  government,  machinery  should  be  devised  whereby  non-Jewishinterests would be  consulted on questions relating to immigration.    3.  A scientific enquiry should be undertaken as to the prospects of introducingimproved methods of cultivation in Palestine.  Land policy could then be regulatedin. the light of the facts so ascertained.   Pending  the results of such an enquiry,steps should be taken to check the present tendency  towards the eviction of peasantcultivators.   The  Government  should consider  the  possibility of  reviving  theAgricultural Bank or devising other means of providing credit facilities to poorercultivators.  ., 4.  The Commission  make no formal  recommendation as  to  constitutional development; but  they draw  attention to the view expressed in paragraphs ofSection A above.   : ;5.  They recommend the appointment of a Commission to determine the rightsand claims connected with the Wailing Wall.  (N.B. This is already being done.)    6,  The question of exercising more  effective  control over  Press propagandashould be examined.    7-  : His Majesty&apos;s Government should reaffirm the statement made in 1922 thatthe special position assigned to the Zionist Organisation does not entitle it to  anyshare in the government  of  Palestine.   They might also examine the possibilityof laying down some precise definition of the meaning of Article 4 of  the PalestineMandate.    : 8,  The existing Garrison should  be maintained for the present.     9.  An independent enquiry  should  be made into  the organisation  of  theDepartment of  Police in Palestine.  (N.B. This is already being done.)                         (D.) Mr. Snell&apos;s Reservations.  -&quot;&quot;Attached to the report is a &quot;Note of Reservations &quot; by Mr. Snell.   Mr. Snellexplains tbat, while he has signed the Report, he cannot associate himself with someof the criticisms and conclusions contained in it, and that he desires to make it clearthat his signature of the Report does not imply agreement with the general attitudeof his&apos; colleagues towards  the Palestine problem. - - -- He takes: a more serious view ofthe responsibility of the  Arab leaders for the outbreak, and on certain points;he&quot;(1)(2)(3)(4)(5).(6). The immediate causes were as follows :                                .  -     the long series of incidents connected with the Wailing Wall.     exciting and intemperate articles in the Press on both sides.     Propaganda among the less educated Arabs of a nature calculated to incite        them.     the enlargement of the Jewish Agency.     the inadequacy of the military forces and of the reliable police available.     the belief, due largely to a  feeling of uncertainty as to&apos;policy, that  the        decisions  of the  Palestine Government could be influenced by political        considerations.
7-1criticises the actions of the Palestine Government.   He dissents from the criticisms of the  attitude adopted by  the  Jewish Authorities in regard to the limits  of immigration, and he recommends that the scope of the proposed Land Enquiry shouldbe extended so as to cover the following questions, viz. :-     (a) the use made of the land now cultivated;    (b) the possibilities of increased productivity; and    (c) the extent of reclaimable land and the possibilities of water conservation           and irrigation.He lays special stress on the need for co-operation between Jews. and Arabs  inPalestine, and recommends, as a first step, that a few men of both races, carefully selected and of unquestioned character and influence,  should meet together andexplore the possibility of common effort for agreed ends.   From such  a beginningthe movements  towards racial co-operation might ultimately be extended from theleaders to the communities as a whole.APPENDIX  2.                    PALESTINE :  PAST  AND FUTURE POLICY,                                       I.    THE policy hitherto pursued was laid down in the White Paper of 1922 by theGovernment of the day, and it will be convenient here to recapitulate the heads underwhich that policy falls :-    (1) His  Majesty&apos;s Government  reaffirm the Declaration of November 1917/which is not susceptible of  change.    (2) A Jewish National Home will be founded in Palestine.  The Jewish people will be in  Palestine  as  of right  and  not on  sufferance.   But  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no such aim in view as that Palestine should become as Jewish,as england is English.                                              .....      &apos;    (3) Nor  do  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  contemplate  the  disappearance  orsubordination of the Arab population, language, or culture.    (4); The status of all citizens of Palestine will be Palestinian.  No section of; thepopulation will have any other  status in the eyes of the law.  ... (5) His  Majesty&apos;s Government intend  to  foster  the establishment of a fullmeasure of self-government in Palestine, and, as the next step, a Legislative council with a majority of  elected  members will  be set up immediately.,         ,    :      &apos;    (6) The special position of Zionist Executive  does not entitle it  to share in&quot; any degree in  the government of the country.                                ;     :    .(7) Immigration will  not exceed the economic capacity of country at the  timeto absorb new arrivals.                                                      &apos;    (8) A committee of elected members of the Legislative Council will confer  withthe Administration upon matters relating to the  regulation of immigration.;  any difference  of opinion will be referred to His Majesty&apos;s Government.           :i:&apos; ; *    (9) Any religious community or considerable section of the population claiming that the terms of mandate are not being fulfilled will have the right of appeal to theLeague of Nations.    Generally speaking, it may  fairly be claimed that these principles have  been duly observed in practice, and  have  formed the basis of  the administration  asconducted in Palestine during  the past 8 years.  But an important  exception mustbe noted.  Arab opposition prevented the establishment of- a Legislative Council, as contemplated :. in .(5), with: the result that,  that  proposal, and . the . con sequentialproposal xander (8),  have never  been carried, into.effect.. , ,  , . to           -      &apos;
     ..... ,,.,.r..., ,.u,           ....        Ill:                           -..   rfgj     It  is suggested that the principles of policy laid  down in 1922  might be-reaffirmed generally, subject to the following additions and qualifications :-     (1) There has been much recent agitation against the  Balfour Declaration.  Onthis point it appears desirable to repeat&quot; that the Declaration, as embodied  in  theMandate, imposes upon  us  international obligations from which, there can be noquestion of receding.     (2) In view of the progress that has been made and the increase  of the Jewishpopulation that has taken place since 1922, it may fairly be said that the foundation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine has been laid, though the edifice has still tobe completed.     (3) The  report of  the  Commission  (pp.  163-4) .  refers-&apos;to   apprehensionsentertained by the Arabs that, by Jewish immigration and land purchase, they maybe deprived of  their livelihood.  This would be clearly contrary to the third  article of the &apos;&quot;&apos; White  Paper &quot; policy which might be explicitly reaffirmed.     (4) This policy has been and will be adhered to.     (5) Constitution. In 1922 His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to set upa Legislative Council with an elected majority.  The Arab representatives refusedto accept this proposal, and, by boycotting the elections,  prevented its realisation.Prior to August last the High Commissioner was  engaged in discussions with HisMajesty&apos;s Government as to a revision of the. constitution in  the direction ofself-government.  These  discussions were  necessarily  suspended,  as  announced inHigh Commissioner^ proclamation at the time, in consequence of the disturbances.It might be announced that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are now prepared  to resumeconsideration of this question if invited to do so, but that they cannot undertake to revive the proposals of 1922 in the precise, form in which they were then made, or,indeed,  to commit themselves on any point of detail at the present stage.  It must bea igoverning  condition that  no  constitutional  change can be made  which  would prevent the Government from carrying out its obligations under the Mandate.  Noconcrete proposals can be considered which  do not fall within these limits.     (6)  Misunderstanding still persists on the subject of the &quot;special position&quot;accorded under the Mandate to the  &quot; Jewish Agency,&quot; i.e.,  the Zionist  Organisation.It does, not entitle that Agency to any share in  the  government of Palestine; theyhave not been, and will not be, admitted to any such  share.  It is not desirable, nor,in view of the terms of  the  Mandate, would  it&apos; be  possible to interfere  with this special  position.  In so far as the Arab Leaders make it a ground  for complaint that they do not enjoy a similar right of access to the Government, the  position couldbe remedied either by Arab representation on some  form  of legislative body or bythe establishment,of a separate Arab Agency (with functions analogous to those ofthe Jewish Agency) as  proposed  in 1923.  Both these alternatives have been offered in the past, only to be refused hj the Arabs themselves.  The announcement  suggestedin the preceding paragraph  might intimate that  these are matters  of which HisMajesty&apos;s Government  are prepared to resume consideration.     (7)  and (8) Irnmigmlion. The principle that immigration must be limited tothe capacity  of the  country to absorb new arrivals  is one which might be reaffirmedin explicit terms; and a  general  pronouncement might be made  on  the  following lines :  The Government note the view expressed by the Commission that the practicepursued has not always been wholly in accord with this principle, and that excessiveimmigration  took place in the years 1925 and 1926.   They do not propose  to discussthe reasons which may have led to a miscalculation of the economic capacity of  thecountry at that time; but they consider it of vital importance that the recurrence ofany similar miscalculation should be avoided,  and  they propose to consider what measures can most effectively be taken to that end.  They recognise that the questionis one that affects the interests of the whole population, and that some machinery isrequired under which all sections  will be assured a  regular hearing in the matter.The proposal made  in 1922, under which the Government would have  been requiredto confer on matters concerning the regulation  of  immigration with a Committeeof elected members  of the Legislative Council, was  frustrated by the  failure of  theCouncil (owing to Arab opposition) to come into being.  His Majesty&apos;s government cannot  undertake to revive that, proposal  in the same form.   Their view is that, ,while full opportunity should be given both to Jew and Arab for making representa-^tions on the subject, the final decision, subject to the general overriding-powers ofthe Secretary of State, must remain in the hands of the High Commissioner.
    With  the  question  of  immigration is closely connected that of  land.   TheCommission^ report  draws  attention  to the  unfortunate position  in  whichagricultural tenants are placed, under present conditions, when estates are sold over their  heads and no alternative land is  available for their  occupation.   It mightbe announced that His Majesty&apos;s Government  fully accept the view that the creationof a landless class  of evicted cultivators would be contrary to public policy, and that effective  steps must be taken to avert any such possibility.   (In fact, the HighCommissioner is actually framing proposals with this end in view.)    (9) The right of appeal to the League of  Nations might be  reaffirmed.  In thisconnection it may be observed that the importance of an early determination of rightsand claims in respect  of the Wailing Wall is fully  recognised.  The  Government,have already obtained  the agreement of  the League of Nations  to the appointmentof a Special  Commission for this  purpose.  Active steps are being taken  to set upthe Commission without undue  delay.Colonial Office,  March 27, 1930.
