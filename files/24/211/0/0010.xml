C  A B  I: it; E T.THE. PROPOSED ESTABLISHMENT IN LONDON OF A BRITISH     POSTGRADUATE HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SCHOOL.     1.   I circulate herwith for the informationof my colleagues the Report of the postgraduate medical Education Committee (over whom I presidedin succession to Mr. Neville Chamberlain^ whoappointed the Committee in 1925) containing aproposal for the establishment in London^ of aBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.     2.   The appointment of the Committee was the culmination of attempts made in the medical profession over the last 30 or 40 years to reorganise postgraduate medical education.   TheCommittee were carefully selected to cover the mainbranches of the profession concerned;  theyincluded representatives of the London medical schools and many of the leading medical men of theday;   and I think we may feel confident&apos; that no single proposal could have secured unanimous support from a more representative body of medical men.     3.   The proposal of the Committee is that theorganisation of the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School should consist of (1) an existingpublic Hospital (about to become the property ofthe London County Council under the LocalGovernment Aot, 1929) at Hammersmith, with 400 beds in modern wards, which is maintained, and would continue to be maintained, out of the rates; (2)a Medical School connected with the HospitalMemorandum by the Minister of Health.which/-
which does not now exist and would haveto be built and maintained; and  (3) aresidential hostel in central London.-     4.   The financial basis of the Committee&apos;proposal is that certain alternative methodsof securing a much needed expansion of facilitiesfor post-graduate medical education in Londonwhich were examined by the Committee wouldhave been much more costly, and were notrecommended by them mainly on that ground.These alternative methods^ which are fully discussed in the Committee^ s Import, were  (1) the building of an entirely new Postgraduate Hospital and medical School, which would have cost  500,000or more in capital, and at least  100,000 a year for maintenance; (2) the conversion, or rathertransformation, of the only Voluntary Hospitalthat might possibly have provided the nucleus forthe new organisation (excluding a separate hostel),the West London Hospital at Hammersmith, whichwould have cost  400,000 or more in capital, andat least 100,000 a year for maintenance.     5.   As against these alternatives, theCommittee&apos;s proposal in terms of finance means(a) a capital charge for (i) building a mediacal school in  conjunction with the existing hammersmith hospital, so as to convert the institution into theBritish Jost-gra&amp;uate Hospital and Medical School;
                                                if (ii)  providing certain facilities  for teaching post-graduate  students at the  separate hostel in  central London;  and (iii) providing the necessary equipment  for the School;  (b)  a charge for maintenance  of  the Medical  School,  as distinct from  the Hospital, which would  not in any event be large, and  would  be dealt with  on  the same foot as other grant-aided University education, on theMedical School becoming a recognised  School of theUniversity of London;  (o)  a charge for maintenance of the Hospital, as distinct from the Medical School (that is for  the  treatment of  the sick)which would fall wholly  on the London rates, as does  the cost of maintaining the Hospital on itspresent footing; and (d)  a capital charge for building a residential  hostel in central London.     6.   The Gommittee&apos;s  Report, especiallyparagraphs 1-24, is a  considered statement of the public interests at  home,  in the Lmyire,and elsewhere, which the British &quot;Post-graduateHospital and Medical School would serve.   I can therefore content myself with recording my belief that this is a project  of  the  highest order ofimportance not only in the interests of publichealth here but also in  the interests of ourrelations with the -Dominions and Colonies,  and thatif we carry it out well- (as we must if it is to be worth carrying out at all), we shall make an impression on many people besides doctors and inmaxry countries besides our own.  -
      7.    We probably teach our medical students better than any other country,  but for our men and womert doctors once qualified there is no comprehensive and regular post-graduate teaching to be had in London.   Most of them do without it, and the result in inefficient and out of date medical practice is such as should no longer be tolerated in the interest of public health.   Some of them go abroad for it.           Moreover it is to Germany, Vienna, i/aris, or the United States that medical graduates and their relations from the Empire and from abroad at present have to go and to take their money to  get the teaching that they want. I  have many indications of the  attention which is being drawn to  this question e.g. in the Dominion of Canada.      8.    I  should note in particular that the largest  public  medical service  in this country is the Health Insurance medical service.    I am much impressed  with the need for raising the general standard of  this  service both in order to protect Insurance  funds more satisfactorily  and  for the benefit of the insured  population.    Moreover,  insurance doctors  themselves  are  beginning to  realise their need  for some further  education in the  shape of refresher  courses;  and  both  for them and  for doctors who  are  in the  public  health  services  of  Local Authorities  either whole-time or  part-time,  I  am-convinced that  the provision of  a British postgraduate hospital and Medical School  would be one of  the best contributions we  could  possibly make to the  improvement of the health of  the whole community.
2A&amp;  110     9.  While presiding over the Committee^ deliberationsI carefully considered the question as to the incidence of charges if the proposal made in their Report took effect.     .10.  As regards the maintenance of beds in the Hospitalwhich would form part of the British Postgraduate hospital and medical School, the Committee propose that the whole cost ofmaintaining these 400 Or more Hospital beds as a part of theorganisation shoxxld fall on the ratepayer.     11.  I em satisfied that for the reasons stated in detail in the Committee&apos;s Report (paragraphs i02-7) this proposal Isa fair one.   The London County Council have already accepted,in principle, the use of one of their hospitals for thispurpose and I think 1 can secure the acceptance by them of liability for meeting the cost of running the hospital, whichis by far the most elastic and uncertain item of cost in theproposal, If I am authorized to negotiate with them on the basis that (1) claims for grant in aid of the maintenance of theMedical School, which would of course involve a sum of moneysmall In comparison with the cost of the maintenance of theHospital beds, will be dealt with on the same basis as claims from any other recognized School of London University, throughthe University Grants Committee;  (2) the exchequer will providea definite and not inadequate sum as a capital grant for building and equipping the Medical School in conjunction with theHammersmith Hospital.     12.  Unless the Exchequer can co-operate to this extent, itwill be impossible to proceed with the scheme, as the capital cost of a school attached to a public hospital could not beobtained from private benefactors.   There is, in my judgment, the strongest case for such an.Exchequer contribution, exceptional asit is, both on the ground of imperative public health Interests                                                       in/ ,
                                                         PA&apos;                                                       -   /illin this country and of the pronounoed and growing demand/inthis  country and in the great self-governing Dominions/for facilities for post-graduate medical education in London.      13.  At the present stage I cannot form a definite estimate                                                /of what the capital cost will be.   On the best/forecast whichcan be made it should not exceed  250,000, and I propose thatthis  figure should be taken as the maximum limit, as a basis forthe detailed planning of the School, and for negotiations withthe London County Council for the use of the Hammersmith Hospital.      14.   I have placed the whole matter before theChancellor of the Exchequer and am very glad to say that I have obtained his agreement to the provision of Exchequer money to theextent required to provide the Medical School up to a maximumlimit of  250,000 and subject to the School being recognized asa School of the University of London and thus ranking for annualmaintenance grants out of the sums provided for that purpose,suitably expanded.     15.   The matter, however,  seems to me one of so muchdomestic and Imperial importance and significance that I have thought it right to bring it before my colleagues in Cabinet.          I accordingly submit that I should now be authorizedto take the following action in suitable stages with a view tothe establishment of the British Postgraduate Hospital and medical School in London with the least possible delay  (a)  To publish the Committee*s Report.  (b)  To announce in Parliament at the same time that the       Government approve the scheme of the Committee, and will       propose a grant of  250,000 towards the capital cost of       the scheme to be spent on the purposes indicated in this       memorandum.   A draft question and answer for this       purpose is&apos;appended to this memorandum.  (c)  To open negotiations with the London County Council on       the basis of this announcement.  (d)  To proceed with the necessary measures for the       establishment of the organization and its management       when established.
    (16).  The above observations deal with the provisionof a hospital and a medical ^cnooX-for-^the purposes of post-graduate-medlcaJ--,eauoatiori.   But it will,.be-seen- that theCommittee also regard the provision of a hostel, for-^tai&amp;ejxte.^as being a necessary element in the whole scheme.          As to this latter question, it is within myknowledge that a movement has been initiated by Mr. F.C. G-oodejao^ugh,Chairman of Barclay1s Bank, to establish a residential institution,to be called &quot;London House&quot;,  for the use of dominion studentscoming to London to study, or complete their studies in, not onlymedicine but other arts and sciences.   This movement is of very great value and importance and I have been glad to-learn that very substantial progress has already been&quot;made byMr. Goodenough in the collection of funds&apos; for the purpose fromthe Corporation of London, from banks and business firms and .private persons interested in the subject.   As regards thescheme put forward by my Committee, it seemed to me that if theratepayer is responsible for the hospital, and the taxpayer forthe medical school, the provision of the hostel could fairly beleft to private benevolence.   The plan initiated byMr. Goodenough would meet the needs of the scheme of my committee as regards the hostel for Dominion students, and seems to meworthy of all the support which the Government  can give it, short of any actual contribution in money.   I understand thatMr. Goodenough has in mind the issue of a public appeal at theappropriate .moment and  it will be seen that I propose to makea reference to this when the answer is given  in the House ofCommons.   The exact form of the reference I  should propose tosettle  with Mr. Goodenough, if as I anticipate he should conclude that the making of  it would facilitate his scheme.    I have asked him to consider and let me have his N/iews on  this point.inistry of Health,23th Mar oh, 1330.(Initialled)  A.G.

Question.So ask the Minister of Health whether he is in a position tostate what action the Government propose to take on theHeport of the Postgraduate Medical Education Committee?                          Answer.          In view of the public interest in this matter i hope that&apos;&quot;the House will permit me. to make a statement whichexceeds the usual limits of a reply to a question;          The proposal of the Committee is that in order to remedy the most serious outstanding defect in the existing provision for the education in medicine of postgraduate students,a British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School should beestablished in London.          The organisation of the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School recommended by the Committee consists of an existing public Hospital, the Hammersmith Hospital,. with 4.00 beds in modern wards, which on the 1st April became the property of theLondon County Council under the Local Government Act, 1929;  a medical School in conjunction with the Hospital;  and aresidential hostel on a site in central London.          The Committee estimate that the financial provisionrequired to establish and maintain the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School, apart from the.cost of themaintenance of the beds in the public Hospital, which in their view should remain, as it is now, a charge on the ratepayer, willbe as follows.   First, a capital sum not exceeding P350,000 for                                                          /building
building the Medical School which together with theHospital will form the main part of the new organisation andfor providing educational equipment.   Secondly, the sumnecessary to maintain the Medical School as a recognisedSchool of the university of London.   Thirdly, the capital cost of building the residential hostel.          The Government have accepted the recommendationsof the Committee as to the organisation of the BritishPostgraduate Hospital and Medical School.   They are much impressed with the importance of securing without avoidabledelay the advantages of a proper system of postgraduate medical education in London, not only from the domestic butalso from the Imperial and from the international point of view.          The Government will accordingly be prepared tocontribute from public funds a maximum sum of  250,000 for building the Medical school, and for the ancillary purposes which I have indicated, a^1 an integral part of the schemerecommended by the Committee;  and to make provision for grants towards the maintenance of the School on the linesalready applied to comparable institutions of Universityrank.          They understand that an appeal will.shortly be madeto the public for assistance in the establishment in london of a residential institution to be called &quot;London House&quot; forthe use of students from the Dominions not only in medicinebut in other arts and sciences.   Such an institution would,  infact, secure the object aimed at by the Post Graduate MedicalEiducation Committee in recommending the provision of a hostelfor students from the Dominions.   The Government are in full                                                    /sympathy
sympathy with the movement and they  look  forward with full confidence to the success of the  appeal when  it is madeas crowning a scheme to which the taxpayer  the ratepayer andthe general public will be contributing their appropriateshares.

REPORT. THE   Committee   appointed  by  the   Minister  of   Health    (Mr.  Neville  Chamberlain)  in   July,  1925,  to  draw up  a practicable  scheme of postgraduate  medical education centred in London, have unanimously agreed, under the Chairmanship of the present  Minister  (Mr. Arthur Greenwood),  upon  the  following Report.                       , .                         Introductory.  2. It is a commonplace that the process of education ought not to end with school or University, but should be continued throughout life. It is even more obvious that continued education of medical practitioners is specially valuable to them, and through them to all who are, or may become, their patients, and to the advancement of the science and art of medicine.  3. If the medical practitioner is to  render to the community the fullest service of which he may be capable, he must be given oppor- tunities, and-direct stimulus,. from time to time in his professional life, to refresh the knowledge which he took with him in his  early manhood when he emerged from his  Medical School and  began to practise.  He must also.be enabled to acquire knowledge which he could  not acquire when he was a medical  student because it had not yet been revealed. And special provision must be made to bring within his reach yet other&apos; knowledge, which  is out of his reach because of the day to day circumstances and claims of his practice.  4. Hence it has never been supposed, least of all by members of the medical profession, that the practitioner can retain or increase the knowledge of the  science and art of  medicine which he ought to have and apply, unless he is given facilities  for further professional study  after  he  has  first qualified,  in other words, facilities for postgraduate medical education.      .       Previous  Provision in this Country for Postgraduate                       Medical Education.  5. More than thirty years ago it became obvious that one of themost pressing problems in  regard to the advancement of British medicine  was the provision of facilities for  postgraduate study. There were, and are, three main reasons why this problem demandedattention and why it has become increasingly  predominant  and urgent. . First, the enormous growth in the science of medicine and surgery which  followed the epoch-making work  of Pasteur and Lister made it impracticable  to render the curriculum of the medical student   (C18095)                                                  c

REPORT. THE   Committee   appointed . by  the   Minister   of   Health    (Mr.  Neville  Chamberlain)  in  July,  1925,  to  draw  up  a practicable  scheme of postgraduate medical education centred in London, have unanimously agreed, under the Chairmanship of the present  Minister  (Mr. Arthur Greenwood),  upon  the  following Report.                         Introductory.  2. It is a commonplace that the  process of education ought not to end with school or University, but should be continued throughout life. It is even  more obvious that  continued education of medical practitioners is specially valuable to them, and through them to all who are, or may become, their patients, and to the advancement of the science and  art of medicine.  3. If the medical practitioner is to render to the community the fullest service of which he may be capable, he must be given oppor- tunities, and-direct stimulus,. from time to time in his professional life, to refresh the knowledge which he took with him in his early manhood when  he emerged from his Medical School and began to practise.  He must also be enabled to acquire knowledge which he could  not acquire when  he was a medical  student because it had not yet been revealed. And special provision must be made to bring within his reach yet other knowledge  which  is out of his reach because of the day to day circumstances and claims of his practice.  4. Hence it has never been supposed, least of all by members of the medical profession, that the practitioner can retain or increase the knowledge of the  science and art of  medicine which he ought tohave and apply, unless he is given facilities  for further professional study  after  he  has first  qualified, in  other words, facilities for postgraduate medical education.       Previous Provision in this Country for Postgraduate                      Medical Education.  5. More than  thirty years ago it became obvious that one of the most  pressing problems in  regard  to the advancement of  British medicine  was the provision of facilities  for  postgraduate study. There were, and  are, three main reasons why  this problem demanded attention and why it has  become increasingly  predominant  and urgent.  First, the enormous growth in the science of medicine and surgery which  followed the epoch-making work  of Pasteur and Lister made it  impracticable to render the curriculum of the medical student   (C18095)                                                  c
sufficiently comprehensive to turn him out at the end of his course a completely competent practitioner of medicine for the rest of hisworking life.  Secondly, for the same reason, the medical man in practice found it necessary from time to time to refresh his mind and add  to hisunderstanding of new knowledge.  &apos;  Thirdly, the expansion of the  British Empire  and  the rapidly increasing intercommunication between civilized peoples brought to europe ever larger numbers of medical men from all parts of theEmpire and  from  other countries in search of opportunities forfurther and fuller study of the different aspects of medicine  andsurgery in which they were particularly interested.  6. The operation of these three influences became so active  andinsistent that in the early &apos; nineties an  attempt was made to meet this demand in  England, as in fact  it was being met in France,Germany, Austria, and elsewhere.  It was found that whilst numbersof senior students  came to  England, no adequate  facilities were provided for their postgraduate study, and they had no alternative but to seek such facilities elsewhere.   Yet the soil of Britain  wasin fact not less fertile than that of  its great neighbours; the only thing  lacking was  opportunity.   Pioneering  steps were taken bySir  Jonathan Hutchinson, Sir William Broadbent, and Dr. TheodoreWilliams, and the  Medical Graduates&apos;  College and Polyclinic  was opened in  association  with  the famous  Museum  founded  byHutchinson.  No hospital was, however, included in the organiza-tion, and the estabhshment was in other ways inadequate.  In 1919, largely at the initiation and through the influence of thelate Sir William  Osier, the Fellowship of Medicine was founded withthe aim of organizing a general scheme of postgraduate education inLondon. Subsequently, the Fellowship of Medicine was amalgamatedwith the Postgraduate  Medical Association.  Several of the greatHospitals and Medical  Schools, and  almost all of  the  non-under-graduate  general and  special  Hospitals,  are affiliated with  theFellowship of Medicine, and with  their valuable co-operation  a continuous  programme  of  postgraduate  courses,  lectures  anddemonstrations  is  arranged throughout the  year.  In  addition,some of the  large  general  Hospitals  make  postgraduate provisionfor  their own old students.  The  pioneer  work done  by  the   Fellowship of  Medicine  has undoubtedly  emphasized the need for a Postgraduate  Hospital inLondon.  The fact  that, in  spite of many difficulties, nearly 6,000postgraduates have been enrolled by the Fellowship of Medicine,and over  16,000 has been distributed  to the teachers  taking partin the work of postgraduate instruction, gives a forecast of what may be expected after the establishment of a Postgraduate Hospital.
i19The Present Urgency of the  Problem.  7.  Within quite recent years additions to existing knowledge ofcurative and preventive medicine and surgery have been made inso many different fields, and  at  such frequent intervals, that theimportance  of  increasing  what  facilities exist  for postgraduate medical education has grown, and grown with great rapidity.  8.  A few examples, one or other of which will come home to many thousands  of patients and their families as  practical discoverieswhich have brought better health and longer life in their train, are       (1)  The discovery and application of radium and the invention    and use of  such instruments as the  X-Ray apparatus and the    electrocardiograph.      (2)  The  advances in  biochemistry which have  given  us    knowledge  of the existence  and  properties  of vitamins and    the effects  of their presence  in, or absence from, many kinds    of foods.      (3)  The studies of nervous disease through which practitioners    can now differentiate and treat many painful and  dangerous    conditions formerly indistinguishable and therefore less accessible    to treatment.      (4)  The  developments  of  bacteriology, which enable new    preventive  and curative methods to  be applied to a  variety of   , infectious diseases and  infected conditions.      (5)  The progress towards control of tropical disease which    has taken shape in such increasingly successful campaigns  as    those  against the  causative  agents of  malaria, and sleeping   sickness.      (6)  The  extensions  of  chemo-therapy  and organo-therapy    which have brought powerful new means  to assist in the cure   and relief of such  grave diseases as syphilis (in treatment with    salvarsan),  diabetes  (in  the&apos; administration  of  insulin), and   severe anaemias (in the use of liver extract).      (7)  The immense and increasing scope of modern surgery.      (8) The discovery and application to  the whole community    of new means of safeguarding the public health in the widest  Apart from these major and specific advances, it is of the utmostbenefit both to practitioner and patient that  practitioners in theirdaily work should have at their command an up to date knowledgeof continuous  technical progress which is being  made  in suchmatters  as co-ordination  of clinical  and pathological  methods,administration  of anaesthetics,  taking and examining specimensof blood, and numerous forms of minor  surgery.  9. Further,  the  trend  and  development of relations  betweenmedicine and the well-being of the people has brought about in this and other countries a series of general and local Acts of Parliamentsense.(C 18095)c2
 establishing social medical services  for  the  purpose of promoting industrial welfare, coping with domestic problems of sanitation and personal  hygiene, and  reducing incapacity for  work  caused by sickness.   A new  need has thereby been created for the medical practitioner to appreciate what may  be called  social  aspects of  medicine, and  to  qualify  himself to participate  in the working of social medical services.      FINDINGS OF THE EARL OF ATHLONE&apos;S POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL                       COMMITTEE, 1921.   10. In  1921 the vital  importance of spreading new knowledge as widely as possible among  medical practitioners,  and  of enabling them to refresh the knowledge which they already possess, and the obvious fact that in this country these needs were not fully met, led the Minister of Health  (Dr. Addison) to appoint a representative Committee to investigate the needs of medical practitioners and other graduates for further education in medicine in London, and he was successful in prevailing upon the Earl  of Athlone  to act as its Chairman. *   The full  and authoritative inquiry made  by  the Postgraduate Medical  Committee into  the requirements  of the  situation  has rendered  it unnecessary for the present Committee to undertake a similar task ; and since they are generally in agreement with  the recommendations arrived at as the result of that  inquiry, no useful purpose would be served by discussing them afresh in this Report.   It is enough to say that the main finding of the Earl of Athlone&apos;s Committee, who  reported in May, 1921, was that the provision then existing for the further education in medicine in London of medical practitioners and other graduates was seriously  deficient  in  two- respects.  ESTABLISHMENT  OF THE LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE AND TROPICAL                           MEDICINE.  11.  The first defect, the lack of  adequate provision for instruction in public health and cognate subjects, and for research in preventivemedicine,  was remedied in 1922 by the establishment of the LondonSchool of  Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which was made possible by a munificent gift from the Rockefeller.Foundation.  * The membership of the Postgraduate Medical Committee was as follows :   1The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Athlone,  G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,  G.C.V.O.,  D.S.O.   -(Chairman) ;   Dr. H. J. Cardale,  M.B.,  CM. ;   Sir Wilmot Herringham,K.C.M.G., C.B., M.D. ; Sir George Makins, G.C.M.G., C.B., LL.D., F.R.C.S. ;Sir George Newman, K.C.B., M.D. ;  Sir Robert Newman, Bt., D.L., M.P.; I  ]Sir Edward Penton, K.B.E. ; Sir E. Cooper Perry, M.D. ;  Dr. J. Dill Russell,;M.B., F.R.C.S. ;  and Dr. T. W. Shore, O.B.E., M.D.
  The School buildings in Bloomsbury were opened by H.R.H. the prince of Wales in July, 1929.  Professors and students are at workin the School;  and its national and Imperial importance has beenrecognized by the provision of a grant towards the cost of its main-tenance out  of public funds and  by certain contributions to thatpurpose from the Colonies.The  Outstanding Need  for a  Postgraduate  Hospital  and Medical                        School in  London.  12. The second defect still remains. It is that there is no hospital and  Medical School in  London exclusively  devoted to providingpractical courses for doctors resident in this country, in the Empirebeyond the seas, and abroad who wish to refresh their knowledge,to obtain instruction in new developments of medicine, surgery, andobstetrics,  or to participate directly in the clinical practice  of theHospital.  13. Phere are three main reasons for which it may be held that theprovision  of further  postgraduate teaching  would be  more likelythan  any  other  action to  advance the  general  level .of medical practice, not merely  in  this country, but throughout the Empire,and beyond it.       .  ,.I.-The Imperial and International Value of a British Postgraduate                   Hospital and Medical School.  14. First-, the service to be rendered through a British postgraduate hospital and Medical School must  be reckoned not merely in relationto the Metropolis or even to this country as a whole, but with a proper appreciation of what that service might be to the BritishEmpire and indeed to the entire world.  15. There are large numbers of medical men, not only at home butthroughout the Empire, in the United States of America, and  inother countries, who from time to time seek an opportunity, in periods of leave,  to concentrate  on study  of some particular scientificproblem in which the conditions  of their work have given  them aspecial interest.  In so far as these problems  are tropical  or areproblems of public&apos;health, provision is being made for postgraduatestudents at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Those who were responsible for  settling the organization  of thatSchool  always  had  in mind the  conception  of a postgraduateinstitution which, while meeting the needs of this country and of theDominions and Colonies, would also be international in its appeal.  16. There  is  an equally urgent need for a general postgraduate hospital and Medical School in London embodying the same idealand principle.  Such arrangements as now exist in this country forpostgraduate training are partial  and intermittent.  The object  to  (C 18095)                                                 c 3
 be achieved by the estabhshmeht of the Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School is to concentrate and develop facilities for this training in one accessible centre so efficient  as to commend itself not merely to our own country and Empire, but also to those foreign countries whose medical practitioners now find themselves compelled to pass us by in the search for the best postgraduate instruction.   17. A properly organized Postgraduate Hospital and  Medical School, such as the Earl of Athlone&apos;s Committee had in view, with a staff of visiting experts including acknowledged leaders in medicine and  surgery, would attract, and should  be of immense  value to, students from the Empire and abroad who at present have no means of  taking  advantage  of practical  work accomplished in - this country.  The provision of effective postgraduate teaching in London is therefore not in any sense a narrowly national problem.   It is not too sanguine to contemplate that  such a  centre would  meet not solely a national or even an imperial need, but  also an international need.      II. The National Value of a British Postgraduate Hospital                       and Medical School.   18. Secondly, the establishment of a British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School would substantially advance the further scientific training of medical practitioners in this  country after they have qualified.   It is generally  conceded that undergraduate teaching  in Great Britain, that is, the teaching given to medical students which enables them to qualify as practitioners,  will stand comparison  with any in the world.  But the undergraduate curriculum is now so extensive that any further addition to it is impracticable without lengthening the minimum course, and without an increase in  time  and  cost of training which would  seriously  limit the future recruitment  of the profession.-  19. Nor is it  possible,  as has been  shown by experience in the Medical Schools where undergraduate teaching is carried on, to meet the present need  by arranging for the medical student  and the qualified practitioner to pursue their higher (or postgraduate) studies together in the existing  Schools provided primarily for  teaching medical  students.  The Earl of Athlone&apos;s Committee considered this problem fully, and  came to the conclusion that it was not only undesirable, but impracticable,  to attempt  to teach undergraduate and postgraduate students in the same School.   20. Yet the knowledge and  experience possessed by the under- graduate at the moment when he qualifies needs to be supplemented, after  his  qualification,  by  postgraduate instruction.  There are obvious  and inevitable limitations to  undergraduate  teaching  in
medicine, not only because the curriculum cannot be further loaded,but also because it is impossible to give to the young student thatdegree and kind of participation in  direct medical treatment ofthe patient which  alone can. complete  the competence of  thepractitioner either in general practice  or as a specialist.  21.  Further,  a British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical Schoolestablished in London would have an important influence in bringing about a closer inter-relation than exists to-day between the twelveHospitals in London having Medical Schools with great resources of experience  in the science  and  art of medicine and the developmentof medical  skill.   IIP The Special Value of a British Postgraduate Hospital and               Medical School to the Country Doctor.  22.  Thirdly, if further postgraduate  teaching in London could bemade easily accessible to the country doctor, great benefit should result to the doctor and, in consequence, to his patients.  It is stillthe case throughout the rural parts of Great Britain, and even more in other countries within and beyond the Empire where populationsare sparser, distances greater, and  communication more difficult,that the country doctor must usually do his work in some degree ofisolation.   The problem is how to keep him in touch  with new developments in medicine and surgery.  In this country he leaves his Hospital on graduation with a training as prolonged and complete as it is possible to attempt with a large body of students.  But once he has become absorbed in practice hehas few opportunities, even though  he is fortunate enough to join the staff of a local Hospital, to keep his knowledge up to date.  23.  There is a great need of short and highly concentrated refreshercourses for such  men.  In this  country an experiment on a small scale has been and is being made by arranging such courses in certaincentres  for  practitioners  isolated in  rural areas  whose practicesconsist in part of work under the National Health Insurance Acts.  These courses, few and restricted in scope and duration as they are,have been greatly appreciated by the practitioners who have taken part in them.             ,  24.  It  is an  example, and  an example  only, of the value  of  aBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School,  that recourse toits facilities might fairly be expected to maintain and increase theefficiency of medical  service provided for  over sixteen  and a half million men and women in Great Britain under the National HealthInsurance  scheme,  if  year by  year a certain proportion of  theseventeen thousand insurance practitioners, particularly those whoare remote  from  any important Hospital centre, could  be given a chance of taking carefully planned refresher courses.

   Formulation of a Scheme for the Establishment of a British             Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.       The Nature and Conditions of a Practicable Scheme.  25. The Committee have borne in mind throughout their inquirythat the duty laid upon them by their terms of reference is one whichmust be  performed, if it is to be  performed at all, within  certainlimitations dictated by the facts of the present position of medical education in London, and by financial and other probabilities suchas reasonable men must take into account in attempting to devise any scheme of postgraduate medical education centred in London whichis to be, as their terms of reference call it, &quot;a practicable scheme.&quot;  26. They have interpreted  this  expression as meaning that  itwould have  been  beside the point  for  them  merely to set outcharacteristics which should be found in a perfect scheme of post-graduate medical education centred in London ; for such  a scheme would not be  practicable,  because it  could not be translated intopractical  effect within a reasonable time.  27. The course followed by them  in making  their inquiry has there fore, in their view, necessarily been on the one hand not to losesight of the breadth and magnitude of the objects to be aimed at,and, as they believe, to be attained, in the full development of thescheme which  they were to recommend ; and on the other hand, asthey hope, to retain for the scheme a practicable character by keepingthroughout  a  firm  grasp of the conditions of money,  time, and opportunity under  which alone  any  scheme can rapidly be  set inoperation and can realize its great potentialities without undue delay.  28. A scheme of postgraduate medical education centred in London,if devised on any scale which in the opinion of the Committee wouldbe adequate to the needs of  the  situation, must involve either alarge capital outlay on buildings and  equipment, or the acquisitionof an existing institution which, subject to necessary adaptations,is  to be  an asset equivalent in value to the capital sum  otherwiserequired  for the new purpose.  29. Since the scheme must include  in its  scope a Hospital with anumber of beds not only large at the outset, but capable of expansionon still broader lines as postgraduate medical education in Londonachieves  the aims which the Committee assert with confidence, shouldbe set before it, it must further involve  the regular and ready provisionof a substantial and increasing sum of money for the maintenanceof Hospital beds.  30. In addition, the scheme in its educational aspect must involvethe  provision  and  maintenance of a Medical  School whose staff,equipment, and premises must not be, or be allowed to become, atany point inferior in standard and reputation to the best attainable
  31. With  these governing conditions held constantly in view, theCommittee have proceeded by a process of elimination to consider and  put aside,  though always with reluctance, a series of projects which at various points and in different degrees have been found on examination either to be impracticable although desirable, or to be inconsistent, although practicable,  with the principles which theCommittee believe that a scheme must satisfy from the outset if itis to be expected to secure either credit or success.  32. The  various  alternative  schemes  which  have been  con-sidered and  ultimately rejected by the Committee, and the grounds on which they arrived at the conclusion that none of these alterna-tives was a desirable and practicable scheme of postgraduate medical education centred in  London,  are briefly recorded in the following paragraphs.          Schemes Considered but  not Recommended.        I. Building  and Maintenance of a New Institution.  33. At the outset  of their  inquiry the Committee gave  carefulconsideration to  the  question whether  they could  discharge theduty incumbent upon  them, namely, to draw up a practicable scheme,by recommending the establishment of an entirely new institutionas the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.  34. A scheme on this basis would, if practicable,  have had the obvious advantages that the site and design of the buildings, andthe necessary equipment, could have been chosen from the first inthe light of the best. professional and technical advice obtainable;that ample  room could have been provided for material expansionof the organization to keep pace with the growing popularity of thescheme ; and that any difficulties inherent in the adaptation of theform of government of an existing institution (including the arrange-ments for teaching in any existing Medical School) to the needs ofthe scheme  could have been, if not entirely removed, substantiallymitigated.  35. But at an early stage of their proceedings it became apparentto the Committee that to recommend a  scheme which was based onthe establishment of a whoUy  new institution would be inconsistent with their duty to devise a practicable scheme.  36. Phey arrived at this conclusion primarily on the ground thatthe  cost of any such scheme  must be  so great as to remove any reasonable expectation that the scheme, if recommended by them,could be carried out within any period of time that could be foreseen,or under any conditions that appeared likely to be satisfied.  37. The Committee have worked upon the considered assumptionthat no scheme would be adequate which did not make available,if not at the outset,  at a very early date after its inauguration, aminimum number of Hospital beds which could not be put  lower than 400.
  38. On this assumption the best estimates which they were ableto form of the cost of any scheme involving the establishment of a wholly new institution were as follows : -.  39. (1)  Acquisition of Land. The cost  of  acquiring  sufficientland in or near central  London  on which to erect and develop an institution even  of the minimum size requisite for the purposes ofthe scheme must  clearly be large, though it could not be expressedin precise figures in advance of any definite selection of a site or sites.  40.  (2)  Cost of Construction. To build  a new  postgraduate hospital and  Medical  School with 400  Hospital beds must cost(excluding the cost of the site) at least  400,000, or not  less than 1,000 a bed,  this minimum estimate including the provision of thenecessary range  of laboratories,  demonstration rooms, and lecturerooms, but excluding the provision of a residential hostel for post-graduate students (an element in the scheme which, as the Committeeare now convinced, must be regarded as indispensable).  The total capital cost of a scheme on this basis,  including the costof land and of a  residential hostel, could not therefore  safely beestimated at any figure less than  500,000.  41. (3)  Cost of Maintenance. The cost in each year of maintaining a Postgraduate Hospital with 400 Hospital beds must at the lowestbe not  less than   100,000  a year.   This  estimate,  based  on  theexperience of London  Hospitals with Medical Schools,  excludes,as is customary  in the  accounts of such  Hospitals, the  cost ofmaintaining the  Medical School as  distinct  from  the  Hospital.A careful examination of the amount of  income which  might beexpected in the normal course to be available towards meeting thisannual  charge indicated  that  any  grant from King  Edward&apos;hospital Fund for London, and  any  payments by patients, couldnot be expected to produce much more than  25,000 a year to set against the sum of  100,000.  42. It followed  that the balance of  the  sum required each yearto meet the cost of maintaining a Hospital with 400 beds as part ofa new  Postgraduate Hospital  and Medical  School would have to beraised  either,  by  means  of  an  endowment  fund of  the order of magnitude of  1,500,000 ; or by means of  voluntary subscriptions,for which there is already a clamant and competitive demand from existing  voluntary Hospitals in  London with a long history and afirmly  established  body of supporters ;  or at the expense of theratepayer or taxpayer, or  both.  43. The Committee could find no reasonable ground for assuming that, even if the capital cost of such a scheme were ultimately defrayedfrom some source  on which they were not in a position to rely, theincome required to maintain the new Postgraduate Hospital  and medical School (even on its initial scale) would in fact be forthcoming.
 II. Conversion of an  Existing Hospital having a Medical  School   44.  Concurrently  with their  investigation of  the practicability of a scheme  based upon the establishment  of a new institution, the Committee were enabled, by the courtesy of  the authorities of existing Hospitals in London which now have Medical Schools for the instruction of undergraduate medical students, and  of  certain other  large Hospitals,  to visit the Hospitals  and Medical Schools and to examine in some detail the question whether a practicable scheme  of  postgraduate medical education  in London could be devised by  means of the conversion of one of the Hospitals  having Medical Schools into the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.   45.  Although it proved impossible to devise a practicable scheme by this means for a single and sufficient reason which will shortly be stated, the Committee think it well to put  briefly on record the main advantages which in their view might have been expected to result  from the inauguration of a scheme on this basis.   46.  (1) Any Hospital of this type should, on its conversion into the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School, have retained the reputation and traditions by which it holds its present place  among London teaching Hospitals, and though difficulties would naturally have been found in adapting the form of government of the Hospital to the needs of the  scheme, those difficulties might well have been faced with the object of enlisting the help of a medical staff of high calibre, and of an enthusiastic group of lay supporters, in inaugurating the  new venture.   (2) Ahy such Hospital  would have been  conveniently located in relation to the medical centre of London.   (3) Any such Hospital would already serve a large area  in and beyond London,  and would  therefore  on  its  conversion provide ample  and varied facilities for clinical work by postgraduate students.   (4) The conversion of any such Hospital and Medical School intothe British  Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School might wellbe expensive,  but it might reasonably be  expected not  to cost somuch  as the erection of a new building.  It would, moreover, notencounter the objection widely felt to the expenditure of very large sums of money on what is colloquially called bricks and mortar, andwould  not add to the  existing number of  voluntary Hospitals inLondon.  47. Phe further pursuit of these advantages did not,  however,become open to the Committee, because it was in their view essential in the  light  of the findings of the Earl of Athlone&apos;s Committee, andof their own knowledge of the methods by which medical education is carried on, that if  the authorities of any Hospital in London with
  38. On this assumption the best estimates which they were ableto form of the cost of any scheme involving the establishment of a wholly new institution were as follows :   39. (1)  Acquisition of Land. The cost  of  acquiring  sufficientland in or near  central  London  on which to erect and develop an institution even  of the minimum size requisite for the purposes ofthe scheme must clearly be large, though it could not be expressedin precise figures in advance of any definite selection of a site or sites.  40.  (2)  Cost  of Construction.- To build  a new postgraduate hospital and Medical  School with 400 Hospital beds must cost(excluding the cost of the  site) at least  400,000, or not less than 1,000 a bed, this minimum estimate including the provision of thenecessary range  of laboratories,  demonstration rooms, and lecturerooms, but excluding the provision of a residential hostel for post-graduate students (an element in the scheme which, as the Committeeare now convinced, must be regarded as indispensable).  The total capital cost of a scheme on this basis,  including the costof land and  of a  residential hostel, could not therefore safely beestimated at  any figure less than  500,000.  41. (3)  Cost of Maintenance. The cost in each year of maintaining a Postgraduate Hospital with 400 Hospital beds must at the lowestbe not  less  than   100,000 a year.   This estimate, based  on  theexperience of London  Hospitals with  Medical Schools, excludes,as is customary in  the accounts of such  Hospitals,  the  cost ofmaintaining  the  Medical  School as  distinct  from the Hospital.A careful examination  of  the amount  of  income which might beexpected in the normal course to be available towards meeting thisannual  charge indicated  that  any  grant from King  Edward&apos;hospital Fund for London, and  any  payments by patients, couldnot be expected to produce much more than  25,000 a year to set against the sum of  100,000.  42. It followed  that the balance of the  sum required each yearto meet the cost of maintaining a Hospital with 400 beds as part ofa new  Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School would have to beraised  either, by means  of an  endowment  fund of the order of magnitude of  1,500,000 ;  or by means of  voluntary subscriptions,for which there is already a clamant and competitive demand from existing voluntary Hospitals in  London with a long history and afirmly  established body of supporters ; or at the expense of theratepayer or  taxpayer, or both.  43. The Committee could find no reasonable ground for assuming that, even if the capital cost of such a scheme were ultimately defrayedfrom some source on which they were not in a position to rely, theincome required  to  maintain the new  Postgraduate Hospital  and medical School (even on its initial scale) would in fact be forthcoming.
II. -Conversion of an Existing Hospital having a  Medical School   44.  Concurrently with  their investigation of the practicability of a scheme based upon  the  establishment of a new institution,the  Committee were enabled, by the courtesy of the authorities ofexisting Hospitals in London which now have Medical Schools forthe  instruction of tindergraduate  medical students, and of certain other large Hospitals, to visit the Hospitals and Medical  schools and to  examine in some detail the question whether a practicablescheme  of  postgraduate  medical education in London  could be devised by means of the conversion of one of the Hospitals havingMedical Schools into the British Postgraduate Hospital and mediacal school.   45. Although it proved impossible to devise a practicable scheme by this means  for a single and sufficient  reason which will shortly be stated, the Committee think it well to put briefly on record themain advantages which in their view might have been expected to result from the inauguration of a  scheme on this basis.   46. (1) Any Hospital of this type should, on its conversion into theBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School, have retained the reputation and traditions by which it holds its present place amongLondon teaching Hospitals, and though difficulties would naturallyhave been found in adapting the form of government of the Hospitalto the needs of the scheme, those difficulties might well have beenfaced with the  object of enlisting the help of a medical staff of highcalibre, and of an enthusiastic group of lay supporters, in inauguratingthe  new venture.   (2) Any such Hospital would have been conveniently located inrelation to the medical centre of London.   (3) Any  such Hospital would already serve  a large area in  and beyond London,  and  would  therefore on  its conversion provideample and varied facilities for clinical work by postgraduate students.   (4) The conversion of any such  Hospital and Medical School  intothe British  Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School might weUbe expensive, but it might reasonably be expected not to  cost somuch as the erection of a  new building.  It would, moreover, notencounter the objection widely felt to the expenditure of very large sums of money on what is colloquially called bricks and mortar,  andwould not  add to  the  existing number of  voluntary  Hospitals inLondon.  47. The  further pursuit  of these  advantages did not,  however,become  open to the Committee, because it was in their view essential in the light of the findings  of the Earl of Athlone&apos;s Committee,  andof their own knowledge of the methods by which medical education is carried on, that if the authorities of any Hospital in London with
a  Medical  School  wished the question  of  the  conversion of theirinstitution into the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical Schoolto be further considered,  they must accept the condition that  the teaching of undergraduate medical students in the Medical  Schoolshould cease.   48. When  this  condition  was conveyed to the  authorities  ofthe Hospitals who had been so  good as to enter into preliminary discussion with  the  Committee, it was  found that  there was noHospital and Medical School otherwise suitable for conversion whoseauthorities were ready to accept it.  49. The Committee were accordingly not in a position to proceed further with any proposal to draw up a  practicable scheme of post-graduate medical education in London by means of the conversion into the  British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School of an existing Hospital having a Medical School.   III. Conversion of an Existing  Voluntary Hospital not having                       a Medical School.  50. The  Committee  were from  the  first  not unmindful  of  thepossibility that a practicable scheme, if  it did  not take  the shapeeither of  a new Hospital and a new Medical School, or of a- hospital and Medical School of which neither was new, might be arrived at bymeans of the conversion  of an  existing Hospital and provision ofa new Medical School.  51. Of existing Hospitals  in  London without Medical Schoolswhich came  under review by the  Committee  for the purpose of ascertaining whether a  practicable  scheme could be devised on this basis, one,  the  West   London  Hospital  at  Hammersmith,  wasconsidered with&apos; special  care ;   and the prolonged  and laboriouscollaboration  with  the Committee  which the authorities of  theHospital were so good as to undertake deserves  an acknowledgmentin this Report no  less cordial  because  the Committee  have  noteventually found themselves  able to recommend the conversion ofthe West London Hospital into  the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School.  52. The West  London Hospital is a voluntary Hospital without a medical School, situated in the Hammersmith Road and  occupyingpart of a site of 2  acres owned by the governing body.  It was opened in 1856 and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1894. In 1928the Hospital had  225  beds.  The number of new out-patients inthat year was over 41,000, and the number of out-patient attendancesover 275,000.  The cost of maintaining the Hospital in each year is between   50,000 and  60,000, and since only about  3,000 a year is secured from invested funds,  the balance of  50,000 or. so has to besought from voluntary subscriptions and donations.   In 1928  the
total income of the Hospital was just over  56,000, and the totalexpenditure nearly  55,000, so that on the year&apos;s account there wasa balance of just over  1,000.  There was, however, an outstandingdeficit  of  over  7,500 at the beginning of 1928 on the income andexpenditure account.  53. Provision for postgraduate medical education has been madeat the Hospital since  1892  by means of the West London Post-graduate College, which forms an integral part of the organization.  The facilities at the College were described by the Earl of Athlone&apos;sCommittee in 1921 as including (a) clinical teaching in the wards and out-patients&apos; departments ; (b) daily clinical lectures ; (c) courses ofclinical  demonstrations ;  (d) special practical tutorial classes in alarge range of subjects ;  (e) laboratory instruction for public health and other diplomas. Arrangements were also made for instructionat certain special Hospitals and at a local maternity and child welfarecentre.  There was a regular  staff of lecturers and demonstratorsattached to the  College, most of whom were also members of themedical staff of the Hospital.  54. The governing body of the Hospital is a Board of Managementconsisting of a Chairman and between 30 and 40 members, of whom a  certain  number are  also  members  of  the  medical  staff ofthe  Hospital.   The  Charter incorporating  the  Hospital made further provision for its governance by means of regulations relatingto a President,  Vice-Presidents, Governors,  Life  Governors,  andHonorary Governors.  55. It also enabled the President and Governors, with the  sanction of two successive special  general meetings called for the  purpose,to surrender the Charter on terms approved by the King in Council,and to empower the Board to deal with the affairs of the  Hospitalin such a manner as they might think expedient, having due regardto existing liabilities.   Any Supplementary  Charter granted to theHospital was  to become effective only if accepted by  the vote oftwo-thirds of the members of the corporation (that is, the president and Governors) present at a general meeting of their body.  56. Between June and November, 1926, the Hospital, which had then recently increased  its  accommodation  for patients from lessthan 150 to over 200 beds, was informally visited by certain membersof the  Committee.  In March, 1927, the authorities  of the Hospital were  formallyinvited (at a conference with  a Sub-Committee of  the  Committee)to consider the question of  the conversion  of the Hospital for thepurposes  of the  scheme  which the Committee were attempting to devise,  on the assumption  that the accommodation for  patientswould  ultimately  be  increased  to 400 beds, and  that, since theHospital would remain  a voluntary hospital, the authorities of theHospital would continue to be responsible for the maintenance of thebeds increasing in number up to the ultimate maximum of 400.
  57. In April, 1927, the authorities of the Hospital informed theCommittee that the Board viewed  with  considerable concern theheavy financial responsibility which the scheme in its complete forminvolved,  but had nevertheless unanimously approved the general principle of co-operation by the Hospital on the lines discussed, andwould do everything in their power to assist.  58. Progress was accordingly made with the elaboration of plans of extensions and other works necessary for the conversion of theHospital into a postgraduate centre with an ultimate maximum  of400 beds,  the principle of the plans being that since money was notavailable or in sight to enable this programme of works to be carriedout either at once or at one time, it must be carried out piecemeal,and must interfere as little as possible with the normal work of theHospital.  59. In order  to make  the financial aspects of the proposed schemeclearer, the authorities of the Hospital were asked in October, 1927,whether, on the assumption that the capital cost of conversion couldbe met, they would accept responsibility for  the  maintenance  ofadditional beds,  as  and when they became available,  up to theultimate maximum of 400 beds.  The Board of Management repliedin November, 1927, that they accepted this responsibility in principle,subject to the settlement in due course of certain questions as to the apportionment of moneys raised from time to time to maintain the enlarged Hospital.  60. It became apparent in the course of detailed discussion of the plans for the  conversion of the Hospital that the financial difficultiesof carrying out a scheme on this basis were serious.  61. On the best estimates which the Committee were able to frame,the sums involved were, at the lowest, approximately as follows : -      (1) Cost of Conversion of the Hospital.-^K sum  of  at least     350,000 would be  required to  secure the  conversion  of    the  Hospital  into a  postgraduate  centre, consisting of a    Hospital with,. ultimately, 400 beds, and all the lecture rooms,    laboratories,  etc.,  required for the  effective  working  of the    Hospital and Medical School.   This  sum would not include the    cost of equipping the Hospital and  School, which  might be    estimated  to be about  50,000.  No money  was available  or    in sight for the purpose of meeting this minimum capital outlay    of  400,000.      (2) Cost of Maintenance of the Hospital. The cost in each year    of maintaining a  Postgraduate  Hospital with the  ultimate    number  of 400  beds could not  prudently  be estimated  at less    than   100,000.      For the provision of this sum the Board of Management of the    Hospital could only be encouraged to rely upon the enhanced    prestige  of the converted institution as a means  of attracting    voluntary  subscriptions and donations.
125  rw v       (3) Cost of Maintenance of the Medical School.-No separate     estimate was made of the cost in each year of maintaining the     Medical School which would form part of the converted premises,     as distinct from the cost of maintaining the Hospital beds.  But     it was anticipated that  on the assumption that  the  Medical     School would become a recognized School of the University of     London, assistance required to  supplement the income derived     from students&apos; fees might be forthcoming at the expense of the     taxpayer through the University Grants Committee and the     financial authorities of the University.   62.  It will  be  clear  from  the  foregoing estimates that  theCommittee  and the  authorities of the Hospital were confronted bythe double necessity of raising, first, a capital sum of  at least  400,000once for all if the scheme was  to be set in motion ;  and secondly, anannual amount which could not safely be put at less than  100,000(or endowment funds sufficient to produce  the whole or part of that amount  annually) if the scheme was to be kept in motion.   63. Conferences devoted mainly  to the consideration of  these difficulties,  especially that involved  in the  maintenance of the  beds in the converted and enlarged  Hospital, took place between represen-tatives of the authorities of the Hospital and representatives of theCommittee in July and August, 1928 ; and in September, 1928, theBoard of Management of the  Hospital passed a resolution of whichthe material parts were as follows :        &quot;  The Board being desirous of furthering the proposal of the     Ministry of Health to establish an Imperial Postgraduate College     at the West London Hospital is willing to associate itself  with     the  Ministry in issuing an appeal to the British Empire for the     necessary funds.       &quot;  The Board,  however, realizes that over  and above  any     capital sum  spent on buildings, etc.,  a very large increase in     income will be required to maintain additional beds.       &quot;  It therefore wishes to emphasize the fact, that without  very     considerable assistance from other sources, it cannot on  its  own     responsibility guarantee to maintain such additional beds.&quot;  64. An exchange of views between the Committee and representa-tives of  the Board of Management  followed  in November, 1928,and  elucidated the fact that the concluding part of this resolutionhad  not  been intended to suggest (as had  appeared upon the  face of it) that an appeal for funds to establish an organization of imperial and  international scope should also be addressed to the purpose ofsecuring  funds to maintain beds in  a voluntary hospital which, asconverted and enlarged, would form  part of that organization ;  butthat it&quot;had&apos;been intended to suggest that some part of the moneyraised by any such appeal should be used as an endowment fund forthe purpose of maintaining beds in the hospital.
  65. From this and other comments made on the same occasion theCommittee gained the impression not only that,the Board of Manage-ment viewed with great anxiety their prospective responsibilities asan element in the governing body whose task it would be to maintain a greatly enlarged hospital, but, further, that in the minds of certainlay members of the Board, if not also among the medical staff of theHospital, the question had arisen whether the West London Hospitalwould not be better off if it remained as it was.  66. The Committee, on the other hand, had now become deeplyconcerned to bring their labours to a fruitful conclusion by devisingnot, as has already been explained, a perfect scheme, but a practicablescheme,&apos; of postgraduate medical education centred in  London.  67. They had sat for more than three years ; they had examined,and felt bound to reject, the  alternative methods of arriving at  ascheme set out in the previous parts of this Report.;  Up to this moment the conversion of the West London Hospitalwas the most practicable, indeed the only practicable, means whichthey had been able to discern of securing the establishment of theBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School within any periodof time which could be foreseen.  ,  68. They  therefore responded with alacrity to a suggestion con-veyed to them during December,  1928, that the  Board of Manage-ment would be prepared to regard the proposed conversion of theHospital with renewed favour if there were- communicated to themoil behalf of the Committee a general statement of the nature of theproposal, laying stress upon the height of the opportunity which itoffered to those who had the future of the existing Hospital at heart;and a further statement of the effect which the  Board&apos;s resolution of September, 1928,  had made upon the minds  of the Committee.  69. A letter to this effect was sent to the Hospital  in January,1929, in the name^of  the Committee, and in the course of that letterit was stated that   (1)  The Committee were under the  impression that the under-standing between the Board and the Committee of the nature of theproposal, and of possible means  of  carrying it  out, was still not complete,  and were most anxious to remove any misapprehensionwhich might exist.  70. (2) The Committee desired to be  assured  that they carriedwith them both the Board and the professional staff of the Hospitalin appreciation and  whole-hearted acceptance of a proposal whichwould involve, it was true, heavy  sacrifices  in  time and thoughton the part of those who carried it through, but promised in return,if it could be fully accomplished, most important gains to the health and welfare of mankind.
  71. (3) The Committee understood that the Board had  recon-sidered the resolution passed by them in September, 1928,  in the sense that they now realized and accepted the position in which thegoverning body of the new Hospital and Medical School would stand for the purpose of securing the money required for the maintenanceof beds in that Hospital up to the maximum number of 400 whichwas  contemplated.  The responsibility which would rest upon that body would,  ofcourse, be ultimately to maintain that number of beds in lieu of the225 beds at present maintained in the existing Hospital.  But this responsibility would not have to be faced in full at once,and  it seemed to the  Committee that the Board of the existingHospital could do much to enable the future to be faced with con-fidence by co-operating whole-heartedly in the appeal which had been contemplated to the public for money to secure the establishment ofthe new  Hospital and of the Medical School (as distinct from themaintenance of beds in the new Hospital), and by determining, so faras they were concerned, to rely for obtaining the additional money which would be necessary to maintain any increased number of beds in the new Hospital upon public recognition of? the  altered status and character of the Hospital.  72. (4) While it  had never been  contemplated that any suchappeal should be issued by the Minister of Health, a course whichmight be detrimental to the success of the  appeal, the organizationand management of such an appeal would in itself be a task of con-siderable magnitude, and the Committee had assumed that this taskmust be  undertaken by an Appeal Committee under distinguishedpatronage, to be specially constituted for the purpose, on which theywould expect the Board of the existing Hospital to be substantiaUyrepresented.                              ,  73. In response  to this letter the Board  of  Management  ofthe  Hospital, on  the 22nd January, 1929, passed the followingresolution :       &quot;  This Board, having considered the letter from the Secretary     of the Ministry of Health  of  the  2nd  January, and having     received from the Medical Council the assurance of the whole-     hearted support of the Professional Staff, welcomes the oppor-     tunity of the establishment of the British Postgraduate Hospital     and Medical School by means of the  conversion of the West     London  Hospital for such a purpose,  and agrees to do all in     its power to further such object on the basis of the letter from     the Ministry of Health.      &quot;  The Board requests its Chairman and  the Dean  of  the     Postgraduate College to confer with the Ministry of Health and     the Postgraduate Medical Education Committee  with a view to     the appointment of a Committee to arrange for an early appeal     for the necessary funds.&quot;  (C 18095) .                                                D
   74. It might  appear from the foregoing narrative that by the passage of this resolution the last obstacle had been removed not, it is true, to the establishment of the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical  School, which was  still remote, but to the conception of a practicable scheme, that is, a scheme based upon the conversion of the West London Hospital  and the  establishment of a new Medical School in conjunction with the converted Hospital.   75. In fact, however, the Committee could not but be aware that certain  formidable difficulties remained to be surmounted.   They had then long had in mind the provision of a fully equipped and modernized Hospital of not less than 400 beds as the nucleus round which a complete Postgraduate Medical Hospital and School should be built up. But it had become obvious that heavy capital expendi- ture would have been requisite to bring the West London Hospital up to this minimum size.  Further, the system of governance established under the Charter of the West London Hospital appeared to be altogether unsuitable to the needs of the  Postgraduate Medical Hospital and School  as the Committee conceived it, and drastic  changes would have been requisite.  The Committee had,  moreover,  come to  anticipate  an  early demand for the expansion of the minimum number of 400 Hospital beds, and any such expansion would have been extremely difficult to carry out on the restricted area (2J acres) of the site of the West London Hospital.  76. At the  moment  when the Committee  were proceeding  to attempt to find means of removing these difficulties in the way of the only practicable scheme of postgraduate medical education centred in London which had as yet presented itself  to them during  more than three years of deliberation, they were confronted during the early months of 1929 by the emergence of another alternative which they  could not reasonably dismiss as  impracticable, and  were accordingly bound to take into  account  while continuing to keep under consideration the  resolution passed by the Board of Manage-ment of the West London Hospital in January, 1929.  77. The  new element in  the situation which inevitably brought this  further alternative to the  notice  of the Committee  was the rapid progress through  Parliament  of the measure which on the27th March, 1929, became law as the Local Government Act,  1929.  78. That part of the Bill which was immediately germane to the question of devising  a practicable scheme of  postgraduate medical education centred in London was, of course, the clauses relating  to the transfer of the functions of Poor Law Authorities to the Councils of  Counties,  including  the  London  County  Council,   and theadministration of those  functions after the 1st April, 1930, by the Local Authorities.
  79. These clauses (now included in  the twenty sections whichform Part I of the Act) were considered in Committee in the Houseof Commons before the end of  1928, and it was therefore by this time already clear that, subject to the  exigencies of Parliamentaryevents,  the London County Council would early in 1930  take theplace of the 25 Boards of  Guardians in London and become directly responsible  (with  minor  exceptions  which  are irrelevant  in  thepresent  connexion) for discharging their functions.  80. The  Committee  accordingly had  before them, from  an earlydate in  1929 onwards, a new prospect, which became increasinglydefinite  throughout the early months of the year, that the LondonCounty  Council  would shortly be a Local Authority  charged  withthe duty of providing and maintaining public  accommodation forthe sick poor in  London.  81. What was directly  relevant to the Committee&apos;s inquiry wasthat the existing institutions thus to be transferred to the LondonCounty  Council included nearly 30 public  Hospitals technicallyknown as Separate Infirmaries.*  82. These existing public Hospitals in London contained betweenthem in 1927 over 16,500 beds.   The average number  of these bedsoccupied in that year  was nearly 14,000, and the  total number ofadmissions to beds was nearly 127,000.  83. In order to indicate the  arrangements which would  be madefor the administration  of these Hospitals as part of the work trans-ferred from  the Guardians, the London  County  Council  had toprepare  and submit to the Minister what is called in the Act an administrative scheme.  84. The Council were required in  preparing  their scheme to  haveregard to the desirability of securing that, as soon as circumstances permit, the maintenance and treatment  of sick persons and pregnantwomen  in hospitals (as well as other services) are  provided, so  faras the law allows, otherwise than  by way of poor relief, that is to saynot under the Poor Law Act, 1927, but under the general law relatingto public health and local government  (including the  Act  of 1929).  85. If the Council had desired  to deal with  any service  from the outset in this way, they would have had to include a declaration to that effect in their administrative scheme; but the conclusion at which theyin fact arrived was that the time was not yet ripe for making such adeclaration as  regards maintenance and treatment  in   hospitals.    * A Separate Infirmary is an institution at  present the property of guardians, and about to become the property of the Council, which is wholly devoted to the reception of the sick. The chief officer of  a SeparateInfirmary  is a  Medical   Superintendent,  and   the  internal  affairs of separate Infirmaries  are  regulated  by special orders (as distinct from thegeneral order which regulates institutions belonging  to Guardians, but not wholly devoted to the reception of the sick)  made by the  Minister of Health..
 Their reasons for this decision were that, having regard to the varied character of the cases dealt with at the several institutions, and the manner in which the accommodation  for such cases is distributed, they felt that  at the present  time  it would not be desirable, even if it were practicable, to earmark particular institutions for specified purposes, and that any attempt to do so would seriously prejudice the formulation of a scheme  for reclassifying and  otherwise dealing with the transferred institutions.   Before any such scheme could be prepared, it would be necessary for a complete survey to be made of the existing buildings and the nature of the accommodation in them, and to obtain as a result of actual experience evidence as to the requirements of the several classes  of case to be dealt with.   86. At the same time, the Council have indicated their agreement with the view  that maintenance and treatment in  hospitals (among other  services) should be provided otherwise than by way of  poor relief as soon as circumstances  permit, both by including a general declaration to this effect in  their administrative  scheme,  and by referring this service (as well as other  services transferred to them under the Act) to  an enlarged  and reconstituted Committee of the Council known as the Central Public Health Committee.   87.  Phe  administrative scheme  of the London  County Council, which was approved by the Minister of Health on the 30th October, 1929, accordingly provides for this to be done ;  and it charges the Central Public  Health Committee in particular with duties in relation to the following kinds  of work which are specially relevant to the subject-matter of this Report :        (a) Phe  provision, classification, maintenance and manage-     ment of hospitals, and the making of arrangements for their     visitation  and inspection  ;       (b) Consultation  and co-operation with  voluntary hospitals     and other  hospitals serving the County ;       (c) Dealing with  cases requiring hospital treatment and their     conveyance to and from hospital ;       (d) The periodical review of cases receiving hospital treatment;       (e) The provision of local medical services ;       (/) Laboratory services, medical  instruction  and the training     of nurses and midwives in connexion with hospitals ;       (g) The direction  of staff exclusively employed at hospitals,     and of district medical staff.  88. It  has  been  explained that the  scope of the  work  thusentrusted  to the Central Public  Health  Committee in London,and  the general plan on which  it is to be carried  out, are broadlyas follows :   The Central Public Health Committee will deal with the provision,classification, maintenance  and management of hospitals for the sick, and arrange for their visitation.   The  term &quot; hospitals &quot;  is
211defined in  the Councils  administrative scheme as meaning placesprovided or used primarily for the reception of persons, who requirecontinuous  medical  and nursing treatment,  other  than  mental hospitals.   In this category, therefore, will be included the hospitals(other than mental hospitals)  at  present  administered  by theMetropolitan Asylums Board, and the hospitals or infirmaries underthe control of the Guardians. The administration of the ambulanceservices of  the  Metropolitan Asylums  Board  and the Guardians,and (if so decided) of the existing ambulance service of the Council,will also fall within the duties of the Committee.  For the  purposes  of hospital administration,  it is proposed to divide the County into five areas, each of which will be conterminouswith the boundaries  of a group  of Metropolitan Boroughs.  It willbe possible to make the same areas suitable for the purposes of theSchool Medical  Service,  thereby enabling the Poor  Law medical service, the public health  organization of the Metropolitan Boroughs,and the School  Medical  Service, to be co-ordinated  in each area.It is also contemplated that the hospital areas  will be co-co-ordinated with the-administrative areas proposed to be formed for the purposeof public assistance.  89. The Committee inevitably had present to their minds this and other information bearing on the legislative and administrativestages by which the London County Council were to be  placed inthe position of being an  authority in control of a large number ofpublic Hospitals, of which some at least&apos;appeared at  first sight to afford a possible basis for  a practicable scheme of  postgraduate medical education centred in London.  90. It was out of the question, therefore, for the members ofthe Committee in the discharge of their duty to devise such a scheme(and for the majority of them as being, in addition,  medical mendeeply concerned in  contributing by this  means  to the progress ofthe public health) to refrain in these circumstances from institutinga  close comparison between the alternative  possibilities whichhad now come before them, in  order to ascertain which of these,in  their  judgement, was  the  more practicable  and, in general,the more desirable.         The Scheme  Recommended by the Committee.                Conversion o  a Public Hospital.                            General.  91. The  conditions which the Committee  have throughout hadin mind in considering the possibility of converting a public Hospitalbelonging to the London County Council  as  a  means  cf devising a practicable  scheme of  postgraduate medical education centred inLondon have been those stated in a previous passage of this  Report,namely that, in order to be practicable, any scheme must  present
favourable conditions as regards money, time, and opportunity forthe establishment without undue delay of the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School, and the maintenance and developmentof the new Hospital and Medical School on a proper scale and at a proper rate.  92. Consideration of a scheme on this basis could not,  however,profitably be instituted except after a process of selection from thetotal number  (nearly 30) of such public Hospitals of those, or thatone, which could be reasonably considered fit for conversion to the wider object in view.  In carrying out this process the Committeedevoted  special  attention to  the  possibilities of the Hospitals atCamberwell, Hammersmith, Lambeth, Lewisham, Marylebone, andWandsworth.  93. This detailed inquiry has, of course,  been regarded by  theCommittee as an important part of the duty incumbent upon them under their terms  of  reference,  and  its issue in an  unanimousconclusion has enabled them greatly  to simplify  the problem of comparison to which their selection was a preliminary.  94. It  was apparent to them, on an  examination of such factsrelating to the public Hospitals in question as could easily be studiedon paper, that all but a few of these Hospitals did not present anyadvantages for the purpose of conversion into the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School.  95. These  Hospitals  having  accordingly  been  excluded from-comparison, there remained a small number, finally narrowed downby more detailed examination, and as the result of visits and personalinspections by medical members of the Committee, to two, namely,the Hospitals  at Lewisham  and  Hammersmith.  After devoting a  considerable  period to a close examination and consideration of these  two  Hospitals, the Committee unanimouslyselected the Hammersmith  Hospital as affording the most suitablebasis for comparison   of   the  alternative  means of  devising  a practicable scheme.  96. The Hammersmith Hospital is a public Hospital (without, ofcourse, a Medical School), situated in Ducane Road, Shepherd&apos;s Bush,on a  site of 14 acres.  It was built in 1905, and now has 400 beds,of which 334 are at present assigned to medical and surgical casesgenerally,  16  to  gynaecological  and obstetrical cases,  and 50  to children.  The number of patients on any one day in the year 1928-9 rangedfrom a maximum of 420 to a minimum of 311.  The average numberthroughout the year was 356.  97. The  governing body  of the Hospital  is the  HammersmithBoard of Guardians, who will be succeeded in April by the LondonCounty Council.   The resident medical staff consists of the Medical
Superintendent and  four Assistant Medical Officers.  A  consultingstaff at present consisting of eight surgeons, including two ophthalmicsurgeons ;  four physicians, including two specialists in diseases ofthe skin ;  two bacteriologists ;  a dentist ;  and a radiographer, arealso available for the benefit of the patients when called in by theMedical Superintendent as occasion may require.  98.  The general advantages of a scheme based on the conversionof the Hammersmith Hospital may  briefly be  set out  under thefollowing heads.                     Financial Advantages.                          Capital Cost.,  99.  As regards the capital cost of setting the  scheme in motion,the fact of paramount importance is  that in  the hammersmith hospital there are already in use the full number of beds, namely 400,considered by the Committee to  be  the  minimum number which ought, if possible from the outset, to be available as part  of theBritish Postgraduate Hospital  and Medical School ;  and that thewards where these beds now are  form part of a building none ofwhich is more than  25  years old,  and have been described by theLondon County Council (in considering the future  of the Hospitalas a  Hospital without a Postgraduate or other Medical  School) as&quot; exceptionally good and well designed for the purposes of a hospitaldealing with the  acutely sick.&quot;  A number of the medical membersof the Committee who have recently had an opportunity of seeingthese wards for themselves concur  with this opinion.   100. The Committee feel that in endeavouring to foresee how themain capital cost of establishing the  British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School  is to be provided, they have in the 400 beds in modern wards  at the Hammersmith Hospital an asset  equivalent in value to a large part of the sum which must otherwise be foundin cash.   101.  The Committee  are not in  a position to submit any estimateof the capital cost of conversion and equipment of the hammersmith hospital which should be regarded as precise, or accepted as binding upon those concerned with the execution of the scheme.   But sofar as they are able  to frame any  estimate,  they are of opinion thatthe cost  should not be more than  half  the amount required toconstruct  and equip a new Hospital  and Medical School, which (excluding the cost of a new site and of the provision of a residentialhostel), as stated in  a previous passage of this Report, may be taken as being not less than  1,000 for  each Hospital bed.   On this basisit should not cost more than  200,000 or   250,000 (1)  to convertthe Hammersmith  Hospital into a postgraduate  institution with 400 Hospital beds, (2) to equip the institution as converted, and (3) to provide residential accommodation for postgraduate students partly at the postgraduate institution but mainly elsewhere, namely at  a separate hostel in the medical centre of London.
                      Cost of Maintenance.   102.  As regards the cost of the  maintenance of patients  in  the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School, if it were estab- lished by means of  the  conversion of the Hammersmith Hospital, the position after the 1st  April, 1930, would, if the Hospital remained on its present  basis, be  that  the cost of maintaining the Hospital was a charge upon the ratepayers of London as a whole.   The Committee see no reason why this position should be disturbed in the event of the association of the Hospital, after its transfer to the London County  Council in April, with the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.  The Hospital will be and remain a public Hospital devoted, in the words of the  Act of 1929,  to  the maintenance and treatment of sick  persons and pregnant women.   103. The Committee would not wish it to be assumed, however, that in. taking this view they have been unaware of a criticism upon it which may be expected.   It is obvious that  for the purposes which the Committee have in mind it would be impossible to  better the security of the London rates for the maintenance  of the Hospital (as distinct from the Medical School) which  forms an  integral part  of the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.   But it  may well be  asked why the London ratepayer should be required to give this security.   104. In the opinion of the Committee it  is not unreasonable  to suggest that as soon as, in April, the cost of the maintenance of all patients in the London public Hospitals (nearly 30  in number),  of which the Hammersmith Hospital is one, becomes a charge common to the ratepayers of the whole  County of London, it will be a proper if not an inevitable result that those patients under public care who in varying degrees require the most skilled and advanced types  of medical and surgical treatment and attendance should be concen- trated in a certain number of these public Hospitals.  What number of  Hospitals should be  selected for this purpose cannot at present be precisely estimated ; but it is clear that whatever Hospitals are so selected should  if possible be modern buildings ; and  that  the Hammersmith  Hospital,  whether it  remains  on  itspresent footing or  is associated  with  the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School, is outstandingly suitable for use inthis way.  105.  It will not  be contested that  one  of  the objects of thetransfer of  responsibility for work of this type throughout thecountry from Guardians to Local Authorities is to encourage desirableimprovements in the standard of treatment by a general wideningof the area of charge for  these services.
  So far as any increase  in the cost of maintenance of in-patients in public Hospitals in London  occurs alter the London  CountyCouncil  become  responsible for these Hospitals, there is likelytc be a positive advantage in economy to the ratepayers of  london from the selection of certain Hospitals, among which the Hammer-smith Hospital will in any event naturally be included, as Hospitalswhere specially advanced treatment is to  be provided ;  and theadvantage to patients assigned to such  Hospitals of the  servicesof a surgical and medical staff of the highest calibre is on the face of it obvious.  106. The  Committee do not, therefore, feel  that the associationof the Hammersmith Hospital with the British Postgraduate hospital and  Medical School could fairly be said  to involve  any increasedcharge upon the  ratepayers of London on  account of the cost  ofmaintenance of patients  which should not arise apart  from thisalteration in the status of  the Hospital; and they are confident thatfor any increased charge  that could specifically be traced to thiscause there would be a more than adequate return  to patients  inthe Hospital, and through them to their  fellow-citizens of London,in the restoration of patients to earning capacity, and in the develop-ment of knowledge of medicine and of its application in treatment.  107. It will be evident  that, in the circumstances set out above,any estimate which the Committee may put forward of the future costof the maintenance of patients in the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School, if it be based on the conversion of the Hammer-&apos;smith Hospital, must clearly be even more  conjectural than theestimate  ( 200,000  to   250,000)  tentatively  put forward of thecapital  cost of converting that Hospital, equipping it for the newpurpose, and providing residential facilities for students of the School.But on the basis of the experience of London Hospitals with  medical schools, to  which reference has been made  in paragraph  41 of thisReport, the cost of maintaining patients in 400  Hospital  beds  atthe new institution (exclusive, of course,  of any expenses of main-tenance of the Medical School) should be of the order of  100,000a year, of which some part would be recoverable from patients  or persons liable to maintain them.             Medical and  Administrative  Advantages.                            General.  108. The  Committee have dealt  fully with the financial  aspectsof the scheme which they recommend because they believe it  tobe the first condition of a practicable scheme that it should offer a reasonable certainty of  securing the money required both for the conversion  of  an existing Hospital into  the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School, and for maintenance and developmentof the new  institution.
  They  would,  however,  have  felt great difficulty,  as  a  body consisting  predominantly  of  members of the  medical professionconcerned  above everything to devise a practicable scheme whichshould contribute to the  progress of British medicine, in  agreeingunanimously to  recommend a scheme based on the conversion of apublic Hospital solely because it complied better than any alternative scheme   with exacting financial  requirements  of the  moment,and seemed  more likely  to  respond to financial  strains  imposedupon it in the future.  109. But they have been relieved of any difficulty on this scorein  reaching  an  unanimous conclusion, because  on medical andadministrative points there is  in their considered judgement no lessa measure of  advantage in the  scheme based on the conversion of theHammersmith Hospital as the public Hospital of  their choice.  110. Clinical Facilities.- It  is clear that both the hammersmith hospital and the West London Hospital serve a large  area on theWest side of London, with  a population which is already  denseand is  still  increasing, and   that  abundant  facilities  for  clinicalinstruction of postgraduate students can be provided at the BritishPostgraduate Hospital and Medical School, whichever of  the twoHospitals provides the basis of the new institution.  111. But the Hammersmith  Hospital offers the.definite advantage that it is one of nearly 30 public Hospitals about to be transferredto the London County Council, to which there were nearly  127,000admissions in 1927 ;  and  that at any time after the  transfer theCouncil would be in a position to assign cases drawn  from a totalof not less than this number  to the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical  School, if the new institution is  based  on a publicHospital, in  accordance with  the requirements  of  patients for themost advanced   types, of medical and   surgical treatment andattendance.  112. The West London  Hospital, on the other  hand,  admittedonly just over 3,600 in-patients during 1928 ;  and as regards out-patients  the&apos;Hospital is subject  to  the definite disadvantage that owing to its geographical position, the main entrance being directlyon a congested main road,  there is a very high proportion of admis-sions of cases of accidents and of surgical casualties.  Over 22,700of the whole  number of about  41,000* new out-patients dealt with in1928 are classified in the Annual Report of the Hospital  for thatyear  as  &quot; casualty  patients,&quot; that is,  in effect, patients whoseemergencies compel the Hospital to admit them without any questionof classification  on clinical grounds.  113. Medical  Staff. It appears to the  Committee that the con-version of the Hammersmith Hospital into the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School will  not give  rise to any  difficulty asregards  the position and responsibilities of the medical staff of theHospital as it now stands.                -                    &apos;
  The five officers who, as stated in a previous passage of this Report,form the entire resident medical staff of the Hospital, will in Aprilnext  become members  of the medical staff  of the London CountyCouncil, and the Council will, if this course should prove desirable,be  in a position to  offer them  similar appointments at  other institutions.  The consulting staff of the Hospital are engaged on simple contractswhose termination, so far as may be thought necessary, is a mattereasily susceptible of agreement with the governing body  of the newinstitution ;  and  membership of  the consulting staff of a  publicHospital at present confers upon holders  of  such posts no such rights with respect to the use of Hospital beds, the  treatment of out-patients, or status as teachers, as have by long tradition becomeinherent in the occupancy of consulting posts on the  staff of a voluntary Hospital.  114.  Governing Body. The Committee cannot but recognize thatthe  elaboration of a proper  system of government for a BritishPostgraduate  Hospital  and Medical School based  upon the  con-version of a public Hospital such as the Hammersmith Hospital willnot be free from difficulty.  The association of the Hammersmith  Hospital with the BritishPostgraduate  Hospital  and Medical School would,  of  course, make provision necessary,  to some extent separately,  for governmentboth of the Medical School as an educational institution, and of theHospital as a public institution, of which the London County council would be the governing body,  for  maintenance and  treatment ofsick persons.  115.  But the Council will not, until April,  be in control of  this orother public Hospitals in London of the same type, and the Committeehave felt that it would be unreasonable to delay the submission ofthe  practicable  scheme which they believe they have devised, forthe purpose of discussing with an authority not yet responsible fora Hospital the  details  of the administration of the Hospital if itwere adopted  for purposes which have not  yet  been examinedoutside the Committee, or given the financial and other supportrequisite for their realization.  It  is, therefore, in their view desirable that  they should make itclear that so far as they are concerned the detailed administrationof  a scheme  based  upon  conversion  of a public  Hospital is amatter to be reserved for  the close consideration  which it needsuntil the scheme is not only accepted as practicable,  but is withinsight of translation into effect.  116.  Future Expansion. It has  been pointed out in previouspassages of this Report that if the British Postgraduate hospital and Medical School realizes the wide possibilities  which the Com-mittee believe should be contemplated from the first, and should in
a few years  be attainable, for  an institution inaugurated with a proper sense  of its international, Imperial, and domestic scope and importance, an increase of the  minimum number of 400  Hospitalbeds which ought in their opinion to be available from the outsetfor the purposes of the instruction of postgraduate students on thesame site as the site of the Medical School will within a short timebecome indispensable to the orderly development of the organization.  117. In  anticipation of this  event, the  Committee have beenmindful of the substantial advantages which would be secured by the&apos;choice of the Hammersmith Hospital as the nucleus of the BritishPostgraduate Hospital and Medical School.  118. Apart from the fact that  the Hammersmith Hospital alreadycontains  the  minimum number  of 400 beds in modern wards, theHospital stands on a site with a. total area of 14 acres, which in Aprilnext will be whoUy at the  disposal of the London County council as the authority responsible for  the Hospital.  A considerable  partof this site is at present clear, and it is evident  that the  site  as awhole leaves  ample room not only for building the Medical School,which, in conjunction with the Hospital, will complete (with theexception of  a residential hostel to be built in central London) theoriginal  establishment  of the British  Postgraduate and  mediacal school;  but also for such additions to the numbers of Hospital beds,and such expansion of the educational side of the organization, as maybe called for  by growing demands  upon it  which,  in the Com-mittee&apos;s  view, are certain to be  aroused from the moment when it comes into existence.  119. The site on which the West London Hospital stands is, on theother hand, a site with a total area of 1\ acres only.   It has never been contemplated  in  the course  of the Committee&apos;s deliberationsthat, if the whole of this site were  covered by the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School, provision could be made for a maximum number of more than  400 Hospital  beds as part of  the completeorganization.  120. There  would accordingly be  no room on the  site for  anyexpansion of the Hospital side, or apparently of the educational side,of the organization once it had been established on the minimumscale  which the  Committee hold to be  requisite  to its  effectiveinitiation.  121. The attainment cf this minimum scale on the Hospital sideis, for the reasons already explained in  this Report,  not in view atany early date ;  and  had it proved on a more  detailed  expertexamination, as the Committee  feel might well have been  the case,either that they had over-estimated the capacity of the site, or thatthey had under-estimated the initial requirements of the organization,the resulting  readjustments of the scheme must either  have beendetrimental to its efficiency or difficult and costly to bring about.
   122. It should be added that certain portions of the site are  atpresent occupied by tenants for whom alternative  accommodation would have to  be  found,  in  accordance with  the  Rent  etc.(Restrictions) Acts, before these  portions could be cleared for theerection of new buildings.          Requirements of the Scheme Recommended.                          General.   123. The  Committee cannot doubt,  on a careful survey of theposition with respect to items which must be taken into account  inrelation to the capital cost of converting the Hammersmith Hospital,that the  advantage possessed  by the Hospital from this  point  ofview, namely, that there are already 400 beds in modern wards  atthe Hospital, is of outstanding importance.   124. But  it must be admitted that the conversion of the  Hospitalinto the  British Postgraduate Hospital  and  Medical  School will necessarily involve a considerable expenditure of capital on building and equipment, though the London County Council (in consideringthe  extension of the Hospital on  its present  basis)  have  pointedout  that  &quot; the cost per bed would be lower than at many other places owing to the fact that it is a modern building and  that theadministrative and other sections of the Hospital are well appointed.&quot;   125. The  main requirements of the new institution to which theCommittee think it  desirable to invite attention in relation to the conversion of the Hammersmith Hospital are stated in the following paragraphs.   126. Medical School. The cost of the building and  equipment of all that part of  the British Postgraduate Hospital and mediacal school which would properly be  classified as primarily educational,and therefore as part of the Medical School and not of the Hospital,must broadly be accepted as an  inevitable part  of the capital costof the conversion either of the Hammersmith Hospital or of any-other Hospital, since for the reasons already stated in this Reportno existing Hospital  having  a  Medical School is  available  forconversion.   127. Residential Hostel and Access. The  Committee have statedin a previous passage of this Report that they have come to regard the provision of a residential hostel for postgraduate students as an indispensable&apos; element in the scheme which they recommend for theestablishment of the  British Postgraduate  Hospital  and  mediacal school.   A residential hostel does not exist at the Hammersmith Hospital,-and the cost of building and equipping such a hostel must accordingly be accepted as an inevitable part of the capital cost of the conversionof the Hospital.  -
  128. The  Committee  think it maybe convenient if they make itclear  at  this point that, on  consideration of  the question whereand how this accommodation should be provided, they feel that thescheme may be so devised in this respect as to overcome, or at least to mitigate, an objection which may be felt to the hammersmith hospital, namely, the distance at which the Hospital stands fromthe medical centre of London.  129. It has seemed to the Committee that it would be preferable,in providing residential facilities for postgraduate students as  partof the organization of the British Postgraduate Hospital and mediacal school, to avoid the concentration of the whole of the. facilities  atthe new institution itself.  The only practicable schemes in sight are based upon the conversionof Hospitals outside central London, and there are definite advantages in enabling some of the postgraduate students at the new institutionto reside within easy reach  of the London School of Hygiene ..andTropical  Medicine,  and  of  the  Hospitals  other  than  the newinstitution at which postgraduate instruction in special branches of medical  and surgical practice  will,  as  the Committee  hope,  beprovided for these students.  Nor must it  be forgotten that postgraduate students,  especially those who come from the Empire and abroad, will require recreationand social amenities for which they must  look to  central London,and will  naturally prefer to live for  at least part of their period ofstudy within easy reach of these diversions.  130. What the Committee have in mind is accordingly that theresidential  facilities  to  be provided  as  part  of  the fabric of theBritish Postgraduate  Hospital  and  Medical School  should  beaccommodation for  a  limited number  of postgraduate  students,some of whom, as the Committee hope, would during the period oftheir  residence be  holding  temporary appointments on  the  staffof the Hospital as internes, that is, as assistant resident physicians orsurgeons ; and  that as part of  the organization, but not of the fabric,of the British  Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School, furtheraccommodation should  be offered to postgraduate students of thenew institution at a separate hostel in the  medical and social centre of London.   131. On the  cognate point of accessibility,  the convenience  ofthe British Postgraduate Hospital  and Medical  School from thepoint of  view of  teachers in the Medical School will depend mainlyupon facilities  for travelling by road, and medical members of theCommittee  who  have  proceeded by road  to  the  hammersmith hospital think the Hospital  is well placed, since  it can now  bereached by routes which are not specially congested, and the facilities-for reaching it  are likely to be increased in the near future.
   132.  Access  to the British  Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School  from the  point of view of postgraduate students will depend mainly upon  facilities  for  travelling by  electric  train,  and the Committee are satisfied  that in this respect there are special points in favour of the Hammersmith Hospital.   133.  The Central London  Railway, which will  naturally  serve the new institution,  if it stands on the  site of the Hammersmith Hospital, through a station in any event  not further off than Wood Lane, will be particularly convenient  to students, in that it passes directly by the medical  centre of London, and will  enable  students to alight in close proximity to certain Hospitals-at which  external instruction in special branches of medical and surgical practice ought to be arranged in conjunction  with the courses at the British  Post- graduate  Hospital  and  Medical  School itself, and  to institutions, such as the Royal Society of Medicine, to which students will desire to turn for reference to medical literature and  for other aids and amenities during their period of study.   134.  The  present suitability of the site of the  Hammersmith Hospital in this  respect  will of course be substantially augmented if it proves possible,  as the Committee  earnestly  trust it will, to offer the main part of the  residential facilities for  students of the British  Postgraduate  Hospital and Medical School,  not on the site of the new institution, but at a hostel in the medical and social centre of London, and therefore on or near the line of route of the Central London Railway.                                         :   135.  Special Departments. It is convenient  to  assume for the present purpose  that postgraduate instruction for students at the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School in special branches of medical and surgical  practice will in  the  main  be provided at Hospitals  other  than the  postgraduate  centre itself;  but  that whatever external instruction can thus be arranged, the centre will not be  complete  unless it includes at the least as part of  its own structure  special departments for the study of (i)  tuberculosis, (ii) venereal diseases,  (iii) ante-natal  and post-natal  conditions in women, and (iv) radiology.  The  Hammersmith Hospital  at  present  has  no  tuberculosis department or venereal diseases department.   It includes a modernmaternity  ward  with  16 beds, at  present  reserved for  municipalpatients, and an ante-natal  clinic for which the HammersmithMetropolitan Borough Council are financially responsible ;  and ithas X-ray and electro-therapeutic departments.  136. Out-Patient Department. It follows from essential differences between the present organization of public Hospitals and that of voluntary Hospitals that at the  Hammersmith Hospital  there is no out-patient  department  as such, though in.. 1928 the Hospital
received nearly 800 patients in the category of &quot; urgent admissions,&quot;in circumstances  more or less comparable with those in whichcasualties are admitted at voluntary Hospitals.   137.  The cost  of  the construction and  equipment of a  suitableout-patient  department  (which among  other  things will receivecasualties) at  the Hammersmith Hospital must  accordingly beaccepted as an inevitable part of the capital cost of converting theHospital into the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.   138.  Nurses&apos; Home. Expenditure  on further provision  for thispurpose must be  accepted as an inevitable part of the capital costof the conversion of the Hammersmith Hospital.   139.  The number  of  the  nursing staff in 1928 was  between80 and  90.  There was a nurses&apos; home which accommodated about half  this number  ; but the staff were housed in  three different partsof the Hospital, and some of them were overcrowded.  The  necessity  of  providing  better  accommodation had beenrealized not only  by the Guardians, but also by the London CountyCouncil in considering  the future of  the  Hospital  as  a  Hospitalwithout a Postgraduate or other Medical School;  and it had been contemplated by  both  authorities (as part of a scheme  for  theextension  of the Hospital  involving a capital expenditure whichmight amount to  100,000)  that  a new nurses&apos; home should be built for 100 nurses in the first instance, so designed as to be capableof enlargement to accommodate  a maximum  number  of from200 to 250 nurses.                          Conclusion.  140. The Committee have now reached the conclusion of a Reportto the effect that the practicable scheme of postgraduate  medical education  centred in London which they have  drawn up takes theform of  an unanimous recommendation that the British postgraduate hospital and Medical School should be established by means of the conversion of a public Hospital.  In  parting from their subject in  the&apos;r present capacities, they trust  that they  may do some service  to the cause  which theyhave  at heart,  namely to secure that London  should  offer tothe postgraduate medical students of Great  Britain, the Empire,and  the world, both the  best  instruction and  the  most cordialwelcome which a great centre for the teaching and practice of medicinecan provide, if they make a final reference to the course which theirinquiry  has  followed and to the hopes with which they bring it toa close.  141. It  will scarcely be supposed  that a predominantly  medicalbody  constituted  as is this Committee entered upon their task withany instinctive preference for a scheme in the  form  of the schemewhich they ultimately recommend.
  142. Deliberations so prolonged, and a Report so lengthy, would indeed have been superfluous but for the earnest desire  of  theCommittee and its successive Chairmen to consider fully and fairlythe alternatives to a scheme on that basis which have from time totime appeared to&apos; be practicable.  143. The Committee believe that this full and fair considerationhas been given in turn to the possibilities of basing a scheme on(1) building and maintenance  of a wholly new institution, (2) con-version of an existing Hospital in London having a Medical School,and (3)  conversion of an existing voluntary Hospital not having a medical School, and in particular the conversion of the West LondonHospital. -They  have, however,  felt  themselves  driven  by the logic ofevents, and in circumstances described  in detail in this Report, toabandon each of these  possibilities.   They have done so on each occasion with reluctance, and  with special reluctance so  far as theWest  London Hospital is concerned,  because  of the protractednegotiations  with the Committee into which the authorities of  theHospital so  cordially entered,  and the sense of  disappointmentwhich may legitimately be felt on their part that the issue of so much time and labour should not be different.  144. But if the scheme which the Committee have finally drawnup is unexpected, or even unwelcome, in character to any of thosewho desire as warmly as the Committee to see a remedy found for thegreat outstanding defect in British medical education, the Committeewould suggest the reflection that the strength of the scheme is not that it was cherished by any of them as an ideal when they begantheir work, but that it has impressed itself  upon their minds (despiteany prepossessions in favour of schemes on other lines which mightwell have been lodged there) as by far the most practicable scheme,if not the sole practicable scheme, in sight.  145. The Committee feel no doubt  that the conclusion at whichthey have arrived is what it is  because the merits of a scheme basedupon the conversion of a public Hospital only became clear, perhapsindeed only came into being, after they had already long been engagedupon their task.  146. The passage into law, and still more the practical administra-tion, of  the Local Government Act, 1929, must have a far-reachingeffect upon the study and profession of medicine in this country,and  among  other  things  upon  postgraduate medical education,however it may be  organized and developed.  147. Though the  Committee put forward the scheme which they recommend as a  practicable scheme superior  on its merits to the alternatives which they have reviewed, they are gratified to be ableto feel that the British  Postgraduate  Hospital and Medical School,if it be  established  on this basis, will also serve to demonstrate to
this country and to the world that public control and the spirit of personal service are not incompatible, but complementary ;  and thatmedical education and the application of medical art and skill can be developed to their highest capacity through the free association of apublic Hospital with the teachers and students of a Medical Schoolwho bring into the common stock ah that is best in the historictraditions of Hospitals founded and maintained on another footing,but to the same end. Summary of the Findings and Recommendations of the Committee.  148. The Committee  append  the following  summary of  theprincipal findings and recommendations  contained in their Report.  (1) The  most serious  defect in  the  existing  provision for  thefurther education of medical practitioners in medicine in London isthat there is no Hospital and Medical School in London exclusivelydevoted to providing postgraduate  medical education.  (2) It is of urgent importance  in the interest of medical science and practice, and of the public in this country, in the British Empire,and abroad, that this defect should be remedied by the establishment in London of a British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School.  (3) The  Committee consider that the organization of a BritishPostgraduate  Hospital  and  Medical  School  which is to  fulfil  thepurposes for which it ought to  be designed should include from the outset (a)  a  Hospital with  not less  than  400 beds,  (b) a mediacal school on the scale appropriate to a Hospital of this size, (c) residential  iaccommodation for the postgraduate students of  the  Hospital  and medical School, and (d)  provision for expansion to meet  increased demands-upon the original organization.  (4) After full consideration of alternative methods of securing theestablishment of  the British Postgraduate  Hospital and mediacal school within the shortest possible time, the Committee are unableto recommend as a practicable scheme either building a new hospital and Medical School, or converting an existing Hospital which has a medical School, or converting an existing voluntary Hospital  whichhas not a Medical School.  (5) The Committee do not regard a scheme which involves building a new  Hospital  and Medical  School as practicable, because  thecapital cost of such a scheme must be at least  1,000 for each Hospitalbed  provided, that is, not less than&apos;  400,000 for a  Hospital with400 beds.  Even this sum would not  include the important items of (a) thecost of acquiring land  sufficient  for  the original  buildings and for subsequent extension, or (b) the cost of providing accommodation for postgraduate students  partly on  the Hospital premises - butmainly at  a separate residential hostel.
  It would therefore be unsafe to estimate the total capital cost ofa scheme on this basis as being less than  500,000.  Moreover,  the cost of maintaining a Hospital  with 400  beds(exclusive of the cost of  maintaining the Medical School) could notbe less than approximately  100,000 a year.  The Committee are not in a position to indicate any source  fromwhich so large a capital  sum, or so large an annual income, can be reasonably expected to be forthcoming for the support of a completelynew institution.  (6)  The  Committee are unable to recommend as  practicable ascheme for the conversion of an existing Hospital which has a mediacal school into  the  British Postgraduate Hospital and  Medical School,because it is an essential condition of effective postgraduate teachingin medicine that postgraduate  and undergraduate students shouldnot be taught in the same Medical School, and there is no hospital and  Medical School in London otherwise suitable for conversionwhich is ready to comply with  this condition by ceasing to provideinstruction for undergraduate students, and accepting postgraduatestudents only.  (7)  The  Committee have made  a prolonged and detailed  inquiry into the possibility of recommending as  a practicable  scheme the conversion  into   the  British Postgraduate Hospital and  mediacal school of one of the existing voluntary Hospitals in London whichhas not a Medical School, namely the West London Hospital.  (8)  The  capital cost of converting the West  London Hospital(which now has 225 beds) into the British Postgraduate hospital and  Medical School  with 400 Hospital  beds, and providing thenecessary equipment of the Hospital and Medical School, could notin the opinion of the Committee be less than  400,000 ;  and thecost of  maintaining the  Hospital when the number of beds had reached 400, the minimum number which the Committee  consideressential for a proper scheme, could not be less than approximately 100,000 a year  (exclusive of the cost of maintaining the mediacal school).  (9)  Neither the Committee nor the authorities of the West LondonHospital, who have examined the position in co-operation with theCommittee, are able to point to any source from which a capital sumof at least  400,000 for the conversion of the Hospital, or an annual increase of income from the amount of less than  60,000 now raisedby the Hospital  to the amount of at least  100,000  required for themaintenance of   400  Hospital  beds  in  the British  postgraduate hospital and Medical School, can be secured at  once or depended upon in the future.  (10) Apart from  questions  of  finance,  the site  (covering  only -1 acres) of the West London Hospital does not provide for any futureexpansion of the British Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School
beyond its minimum size ;  and the fusion of the Hospital with thenew organization would involve substantial, difficulties with respectto the  existing governing body and medical staff of the Hospital.  (11)  The Committee accordingly felt  at  a  certain stage of theirinquiry that  if they were to perform their duty by drawing up a practicable scheme,  they must consider,  as a further  alternative means  of securing the early establishment of the British  Post-graduate Hospital and Medical School, the possibility of recommending the conversion of one of the  existing public Hospitals in Londonwhich  under the Local Government Act, 1929, will  become CountyCouncil Hospitals in April, 1930.  (12)  The Committee found that one of  these Hospitals, namely theHammersmith Hospital (which now has ,400 beds)  appeared to be specially  suitable as a possible basis  for the establishment  of theBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical  School.  (13)  The Committee have come to the unanimous conclusion that not only on financial grounds, but also on medical and administrativegrounds, the conversion of the Hammersmith. Hospital is a practicablescheme of postgraduate medical education centred in London.  (14)  The financial grounds  for this conclusion are, first, that thecapital cost of converting  the Hammersmith Hospital to the newpurpose should not, on  the best estimate which the Committee canframe,  be more  than  200,000 or  250,000.  (15)  The principal reason why conversion of the hammersmith hospital would cost so  much  less in capital than conversion of theWest London Hospital  is that the Hammersmith Hospital alreadyhas 400 Hospital beds in modern wards.  (16)  Secondly, as regards the cost of the  maintenance of patients in the  Hospital, the prospective annual charge at the hammersmith hospital after  its conversion to the new purpose should not beassumed  to be less than approximately  100,000.  But  some partof the charge  at a public Hospital would be recoverable from patientsor persons liable to maintain them ;  and the balance would naturallyand properly  be a charge on the rates in the same way as the presentcost of the maintenance of patients at this and other public Hospitals.  (17)  The medical and administrative  grounds for the unanimousconclusion of the Committee that the conversion of the hammersmith hospital is a practicable scheme are that  for the purposes of theBritish Postgraduate Hospital and Medical School the hammersmith hospital  as  converted would afford  ample clinical facilities  forpostgraduate students; that the reorganization of its management in relation both to medical staff and general governance should giverise to no insuperable difficulty;  that  it is readily accessible both to teachers and students at a postgraduate centre and to studentsresiding at a hostel in central London ;  and that its site (covering14  acres) gives ample room for expansion after the inauguration ofa scheme of the minimum scope which is desirable.
  (18) The Committee therefore unanimously report that they have drawn up a practicable scheme of postgraduate medical educationcentred in London by making the recommendation that the BritishPostgraduate Hospital and Medical  School, comprising a Hospitalwith 400 beds,  a  Medical  School,  and residential  facilities forpostgraduate students, should be established,  on  a site  which will permit of its future expansion as its services to the science and artof medicine and to the public are developed and recognized, by meansof the conversion of a public Hospital, the Hammersmith Hospital,at which the 400 beds initially required are already available.  The residential facilities for students should be provided in partat the Hospital, but mainly at a separate hostel in the medical and social centre of  London.Arthur Greenwood [Chairman).George Blacker.Robert Bolam.H.
