In any consideration of agricultural policy at the presenttime it is a first essential that a decision should be reached as to whether or not it is desirable to take definite steps -    (a)  to retard the rate at which cereal growing           is being abandoned and land is going out           of cultivation;    (b)  to maintain employmentj    (c)  to discourage the switch over from cereals to           other commodities, such as milk and potatoes,           with the consequent risk of the creation of           surpluses with repercussions on prices.2.      The existing severe depression is mainly confined to theareas where arable farming predominates,  i.e. in the East andSouth-East of England, including parts of the Midlands andYorkshire, and covers from l/5th to l/4th of the whole agriculturalarea of England and Wales.  The competition of cheap corn fromabroad has steadily reduced the margin of land on which corngrowing can normally be grown at a profit, and in consequenceeach year for some years past the annual returns have shown a diminution of the arable area.  Some of the land has been sowndown to grass, but in many cases it is unsuited to  good pastureand merely tumbles down to rough grass, and thus is lost tocultivation.   From 1919 to 1929 the change in England andWales has been:-
                                                            8.                                             Aores           Decrease in arable area         S,56Q,000           Increase in Permanent Grass     1,050,000           Increase in rough grazings      1,084,000                                            ,154,000The arable area is now 1,110,000 acres below the area in 1913.      During the same period the change in numbers of livestock had also been significant.  For some years after the War there was  a steady increase[ until 1927 in numbers of oattle and sheep fallowingon the serious war-time depletion of our flocks and herds, but  inthe past two years the tide has turned again and numbers have declined in the case of cattle^by 5.1$ and of sheep by 5.7^.     In the past 8 years the number of male workers has decreased.by 75,,000 or 10$.3.   We have already decided against assisting agriculture bymeans of protective duties or crude subsidies,  and the parliamentary situation is such as to rule out the extensive alterations andengagements which the formation of a cereal Import Board would necessarily involve.   It is unthinkable that we can adept aposition of mere helplessness and drift, and the only other alternative as a means of assisting cereal growers seems to bethe introduction of a statutory quota of British wheat in flour,whether milled&apos; in this country or imported..  In accordance withthe decision of the Cabinet on the 2nd April last  (Cabinet 18 (30),Conclusions), I have explored further the possibility of introducing such a quota,  and I submit for the  consideration ofmy colleagues the attached outline (sae Annexe) cf a suitablescheme for carrying out this proposal.4.    The whole position has been exhaustively examined by
Dr. addison In c*nsulfca&quot;tion with representatives of  theScottish Office and  Board  Of Customs and Excise.  He has hadthe advantage of  a number  *f discussions with responsiblerepresentatives of all the trade interests  concerned,  and due regard has been paid to  their views in  framing  the scheme.5.   The Cabinet  will observe that it is proposed  that power should be taken in the necessary legislation for the Ministerto adopt either of two alternative methods  of applying the quota, which are  described in the  Annex-  For reasons  whichare set out in paragraph 5 of the  Annex, I  3hould proposeat the outset to  proceed on the lines of Method 2.6.   The existence of a  quota would ensure  to the home producera definite share  in  his  home market and any increase in bounty-fed cereals (against which no direct remedy such as  prohibitionof imports seems  to  be feasible) could  only take place at theexpense of other  Imports*7.   In support of action  on the lines  of the quota  plan, Iwould mention the following considerations, viz:-     (i) The importance  of encouraging  the  maintenance of cereal         cultivation, of which wheat is acknowledged to be the         key crop, as stressed by  the Selborno  Committee of 1917,         the Agricultural  Tribunal of 1924, the Agricultural         Conference  of representatives  of landowners,  farmers and         workers  which has been meeting this year, and the recent         liass Mooting^ of all clan sea Of agriculturists.    (il) The signs that  grain prices will probably fall still         lower owing to  the surplus existing in North  America         with a consequent accentuation of  the  depression.  (iii)  The decline In  employment, about 2 men per  100 acres,         which will  follow any further  decrease in the arable         area, especially  as much  of the land really suitable for         pasture  has already been  converted, and a large part of         the depressed area is unsuited for.grass.
                                                            4.   (iv) The impracticability of switching over from cereal        growing to meat production on the corn-growing lands        of East Anglia and elsewhere, in which depression is        most acute.   (v)  The encouragement for the production and use of the new        high quality wheats such as Yeoman,  and the stimulation        of technical improvements in cultivation.8.     The Quota scheme does not conflict with international obligations.  Schemes designed to achieve a  similar end havebeen adopted in other countries.9.     The scheme does not involve any cost  to State funds,except for the small increase in the staff of the Ministrywhich may be necessary for its administration.10.    Even without a Producers1 Marketing Board under theAgricultural Marketing Bill, trade representatives considerthat the quota would probably improve British wheat prices by at least 5/- per quarter.  Combined with  such a MarketingBoard, the gain might be considerably higher and might well prove to have a stimulating effect on the wheat area with acorresponding salutary influence on cereal growing generally.   Thescheme would be valuable not merely for its  definite cashimprovement, but as a means of restoring confidence.11.    Any increase in the price of British  wheat which may besecured as a result of the quota should not  have any calculableeffect on bread prices.  The Minister&apos;s power to vary the quotaand the proposed Consumers&apos; Council will together provideeffective checks against undue exploitation  of the qtiota by anyinterests concerned.  Should a Producers&apos; Marketing Board beeventually formed, there will also be the safeguards provided  Inthe Agricultural Marketing Bill.12,    I accordingly hope that my oolleagu.es will authorise theimmediate preparation of a Bill with a view  to introduction assoon as possible this session.  It is very desirable that the
scheme shotild be brought into operation by next &quot;harvest, andI anticipate that the Bill would secure a largo measure of support from the other Parties.  I should add that legislation in regard, to the quota must be applied simultaneously throughoutthe United Kingdom, and it is understood that theauthorities in Northern Ireland, who have been consulted informally,would make every effort to assist in securing uniformity.

             STATUTORY QUOTA OP BRITISH WHEAT FOR                 MILLERS AND FLOUR IMPORTERS.                       PROPOSED SCHEME *          The purpose of this scheme is to secure for the homefarmer a definite share of the home market with the minimuminterference with existing trade practices in the milling of flourand importation of flour into the United Kingdom, while allowing the consumer to derive benefit from feho importation of cheap orsubsidised imported grain and flour.     1.   In the necessary Bill, the responsible Minister willbe given power to make regulations to  apply the statutory quotaby either of the alternative methods otitlined below.  Theregulations would specify the extent and variation of the quotaand other details, and would be made after consultation with a standing advisory body representative of all countries of theUnited Kingdom and of the farmers and trade interests ooncsmediIt would be necessary for the Minister to have power to vary the quota ever comparatively short intervals as in Germany,     2.   British wheat Certificates.  Every sale of british wheat of millable quality    a farmer must (for quota purposes)be registered at a local office of Customs and Excise or by theExcise Officer in attendance at a scheduled corn market.  Onregistration, a British ^vheat Certificate (hereinafter referredto as a  iuota Certificate) showing quantity etc, will beissued to the buyer by the Excise Officer.  The Certificate willbe transferable.  If a consignment is at any time rejected onthe grounds of quality, the Quota Certificate will be cancelledby the appropriate Department.  Existing trade machinery will
                                                             2.be available for determining and settling disputes with  regardto the milling quality of any given consignment of wheat.          The detailed procedure will be  settled after discussionWITH all Interests concerned,  provisionally,  the arrangements maywork somewhat as follows          The farmer, as at present, will sell to a  merchant  or     miller on the basis of sample submitted.   On the request of     the farmer, the Excise Officer issues Quota Certificates to     the buyer in respect of x cwt. of wheat of mlllable quality.     Appendix I. is a rough draft of the  form of request and     Appendix II of the Quota Certificate.  The term &quot;millable     quality&quot; will be defined as regards  bushel weight,  moisture-     content, etc., with reference to a standard sample  for the     season made up and agreed to by farmers,  millers and merchants,     who will also agree on a range of price premiums and discounts     for variations therefrom.  This is a. common practice in  the     Corn Trade as regards imported wheat.  The price will,     therefore, be an indication to the Excise Officer whether the     wheat concerned in any transaction is of milling quality.   If     the transaction is effected below a  certain price,  being, say,     the Gazette Average less maximum standard discounts, the     Officer would refer the question of  quality to  an officially     recognised local arbitration panel before Issuing the     Certificate.  This arbitration machinery as regards farmers     and merchants is already in existence but it may he necessary     to provide for the representation of millers.          *4uota Certificates will be made out by the Excise     Officer in triplicate; a copy being  given to the buyer,  a copy     being sent to the Minis-try of Agriculture or the Department     of Agriculture for Scotland as the case may be, and a copy     being retained by the Excise Officer for record purposes.     The Certificate issued to the buyer  will be transferable with     the wheat and each successful transfer will be  endorsed  on     the back of the Certificate until it reaches the buyer who     takes delivery of the actual wheat concerned.   He endorses     the Certificate to the effect that delivery has been taken     and the wheat accepted 8 3 being of milling quality.  In     certain cases, the buyer may also be required to notify  the     appropriate Department of his intention to order on the  wheat     so as to provide an opportunity for  checking weight and  -     quality if the Department so desires.  In the event of the     quality, on such a check, being found to be not of  milling     standard, the Certificate would be withdrawn and cancelled..     In the general case -here a buyer, on receipt of the bulk,     disputes the quality, the matter will be referred to a local     arbitration panel for decision and subseqtient endorsement or     cancellation of the Certificate.          In order to avoid an excessive  issue of wheat
Certificates  in advance of  actual  deliveries from  farms,it  could  tie laid  .5own  that  a Certificate will not  betenderable for quota purposes until  delivery of thewheat has actually been taken.  This will militateagainst the creation of a paper market entirely divorced from actual wheat.     Some check on individual farmers will be necessaryto  ensure that the quantity of wheat sold correspondsbroadly with  tho  acreage and production in each case.For this purpose, the Ministry would compile theCertificates  relating to the sales of individual farmershore and there throughout the country and possibly withthe assistance of the National Farmers&apos; &quot;Union, who wouldalso be interosted parties, would carry out the checkrequired.     The total amount of the Certificates in the possession of the Ministry  at any time will indicate thetotal amount of wheat sold by farmers for quotapurposes and will thus be a valuable guide to theMinister in ensuring that the quota  figure accords, fromtime to time,  with available supplies.      3. The Miller.       Method 1. Each flour mill will &quot;be required togrind the statutory quota of British wheat in each gristfor grinding) undertaken by the mill.          As part of the evidence in satisfaction of this obligation each mill will be required to prodtice, and surrender to the responsible Department, Wheat QuotaCertifievtes for the quantity of British wheat required tobe ground under the quota rules during a prescribed period.      Other records would also be necessary in the formof a *Kheat stock book and a flour stock book as well asa daily record of gristings.  All such records arecommonly kept in mills and it is probable that little or no additional book-keeping would be required.       Method 2.  British flour millers, as a whole, will berequired to purohase a prescribed quantity of British wheat(the Quota) and to produce Wheat Qtiota Certificates as evidence that they have done so.  There will, however, beno obligation upon each individual mill to grind its quota
quantity, but oach mill will be requires to produce wheat quota Certificates for an amount corresponding to the  quotareckoned on the total quantity of wheat of all kinds milledin that mill.          Millers who hold Quota Certificates in excess  ofquota requirements will be at liberty to transfer theirexcess of certificates to other persons who need them.     The quantity represented by each miller&apos;s QuotaCertificates will be checked by1the responsibleDepartment against the total quantity of wheat milledby the miller.  The Certificates will then be taken up.  The ordinary mill records will probably be foundsufficient for cheeking purposes.     4. The flour Importer.   (a) Method 1.  Each flour Importer will be required tomix or blend at the port, in a bonded warehouse,  the quotaquantity of National Mark, j,e. All-British Flour of standardquality, with each parcel of imported flcur, and  to produce and surrender to the Customs,  Wheat Quota Certificates(purchase &apos; with the National Mark flour)  for an amountequivalent to the quota reckoned upon the flour Imported.          Certain warehouses would need to be licensed for     the purpose and the warehousemen and importers concerned     would be required to keep flour stock books  showing the     amount of homo and imported flour received,  mixed,     despatched and on hand.  The National Mark labels     attached to the sacks of home flour would be a sufficient     indication to the Customs Officer concerned  of the     origin and quantity of the flour used for mixing.   fb) Method 2.  In order that a flour importer may clear hisflour from Customs control, he must obtain by purchase ofNational Mark flour, or British wheat, or otherwise. wheat quota Certificates representing a quantity of British wheat equivalent to the amount of the Quota reckoned on the flourthat he desires to import, and surrender them to the Customs.
           In this  case, there would he no need for records on the      part  of the importer.   If he did not wish to act as a      distributor of home flour or to buy home wheat, he could      instruct a country miller or merchant to buy and sell      British wheat and to retain on his behalf and forward to      him the Quota Certificates attached thereto.  The Certificates      would be produced to the Customs when the imported flour      is landed,      5.  Comparison of Methods 1 and 2.           The British millers have expressed themselves aswilling to undertake the obligations involved in Method 1,and have expressed a strong preference for that particularmethod.  The large factory bakers and the flour importers in both  England and Scotland maintain, however, that the admixtureof home-grown wheat in every grist and in every sack of importedflour would  give rise to serious technical difficulties andinterfere  with their existing trade in special types of flour andbread.  The  Scottish bakers, although willing to use their fullquota of home  wheat flour in their ovvn way, particularlyobjected to  the supply of flour already mixed, and preferred todo their own mixing; they were, however, not supported on thispoint by the  Scottish Co-operative representatives.  Therepresentatives of the retail bakers in England and Wales raisedlittle or no  objection on technical grounds.  strong representations against the blending of imported flour have been .made  on behalf of Canadian and Australian milling interests.           It has to be recognised,  too,  that this method wouldinvolve a certain amount of uneconomical transportation ofwheat and flour to milling centres,  and to ports,  whileimporters would be put to the additional expense necessitated .by the blending requirements,          On the  other hand,  Method 2  has the following a^vanta-::es  ;-     (i)   It obviates  uneconomic  transfer of wheat and flour
                                                        8.     Wto distant milling centres  ana ports and is- likely -^VTWM  381favourable to the country miller than Method  1.  (ii)  It releases importers from the necessity to incurexpense in Installing and maintaining flour blendingmachinery at ports and removes any likelihood of serious objections from. Dominion flour, exporters. (Hi)  It leaves the industry free to manufacture and import without interfering  with trade practices.  (iv)  Through greater elasticity, it gives  the responsibleMinistry greater freedom in fixing the amount of the quota andavoids the difficulties of  temporary or local shortages ofBritish wheat.        On the  general question of quality,  since theactual use of the wheat is  compulsory under Method 1, theimmediate effect of that Method would be to create a premiumon those varieties most suitable for milling.  Under Method 2,the same result will be attained to the extent to which millerschoose actually to mill their quota, but probably the effect will be more indirect and it will take some time for it to be felt.  Improvements in production technique can in any caseonly be expected to occur gradually.  Broadly, such premiumas the Certificates command under either Method will be ameasure of the upward pull on the price of home wheat sfstandard milling quality.  The fact that millers can if need be take the wheat and mill  it will prevent the  QuotaCertificates, as such, from commanding an excessive premium.   6.   Note on Method of Determining the Quota.  the quota would be designed to  absorb in the course of the year allthe available British wheat of mil]able quality.   (It isestimated that about 80 per cent, is normally fit formilling but only about 65 per cent, of the total is  thus used. -
Further,  the amount of British wheat in home milled flour ofall kinds represents only about 13-i per cent, although the crop represents 20 per cent, of the total available suppliesof wheat).  It is proposed that a certain minimum quotashould he prescribed to he effective throughout the whole year hut  that the responsible Minister should have power to vary the amount of the quota from time to time, say, monthlyor quarterly.  He will have at his disposal, as a matter ofexisting routine, sufficient information as to acreage,yields, sales and. stocks on farms to enable him to determinea suitable percentage with reasonable accuracy.  In the months immediately after harvest he wonId normally fix the quota at a higher figure than later in the season.  Variationswould apply during a prescribed period and would only he made after consultation with all the interests concerned represented on a standing advisory Committee.  It will he necessary for the quota figure, including any variations thereof, to he applicablesimultaneously throughout Great Britain and, by arrangement,Northern Ireland.        The Minister&apos;s power to vary the quota from time totime, if necessary, will he a corrective in the event of any possible miscalculation and a safeguard against any abuse whichmight arise in connection with the quota provisions.   7.  The Quota System, in relation to a Wheat Marketing Board.It is generally agreed that farmers will not reap the full benefito&quot; a quota system, until they take steps to centralise the selling of their wheat by setting up a Board under theAgricultural Marketing Bill which, incidentally, also contains special provisions for safeguarding the interests of consumers.  Without  a  Marketing Board,  the quota system mayhe expected to improve the position of  British wheat hyputting it in a  category along  with other desirable  milling
                                                    8.wheats.  To this extent, farmers might expect to receive anadditional 5/- or so per quarter above the price normally-secured for British wheat, but, in the absence of a MarketingBoard, it is possible that some even of this benefit will be absorbed by the grain merchants and millers.         The value of a Board, operating on behalf of the producers would ultimately have an influence exceeding theprice gains to be derived from a quota, in that it wouldbecome an active agency in the interests of farmers in providing a better standard of cultivation and agriculturaltechnique.   The provision, under a quota system, of adefinite market for British wheat will supx^ly the confidencenecessary to enable farmers to go forward and set up a WheatMarketing Board and will ensure to such an organisation a strength of bargaining power at any rate equal to that ofthe organised millers.
