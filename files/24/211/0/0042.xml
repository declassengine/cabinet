 THIS document 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOvERMBNT).                               Gaping titSecretc:pTT43(go)                 Statutory Quota of British Wheat in Flour.                 Memorandum by tho Parliamentary Secretary                 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.        The memorandum of the Chancellor of the exchequer on the wheat Quota (CP. 139(30)) reveals a misunderstandingboth of the nature of the proposal itself and of its implications, as well as of the reasons for it.2.        He appears to base his p&amp;reference upon thepolicy of the late Government, and to consider that in agreat part of England the decline of arable cultivationcould,  or would, be accompanied by a development of the livestock Industry.  This process, (the decline of cultivation), has been going on at an alarming pace for years past and has not had the result forecasted; indeed,the opposite, and over a large part of England the declinein cultivation is acoompanied by an actual diminution of livestock.  This vast decline of arable cultivation has not,moreover, been accompanied by any other compensatingadvantage, and on what ground therefore the Chancellorprays for its continuance or acceleration it is  difficultto understand.3.        The labour Party,  moreover, has never  acceptedthe policy of impotence as set out by the last government as the  one that it should imitate, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer belongs to a P-.ixty which has declared  thatit proposes to help &quot;to  make farming pay&quot;.4*        It was explained  in the  Cabinet Memorandum thatthe position of a proportion of cereal cultivation  in theeoonoroy of the industry is entirely misrepresented by thepercentages given.  If cereal  cultivation is  to  have a                                                      fair
fair chance it must cease to be the helpless victimof market conditions over whioh neither producers norgovernment have any oontrol.5.        The Chancellor says that the policy is&quot;wrong in principle&quot;.   In what reepeot is it wrong inprinciple that the British grower should have a fair shareof the British market?  Is it wrong in principle thathe should be equipped with some machinery for self-help?If these things are wrong in agriculture, on what groundsdo we justify tho Sugar Beet fcubsidy or the Coal Bill?6.         very other modern Government appears to takethe view that the cultivation of its land is oasential tothe well-being oi its people, and I claim that that Istrue in  england.  Moreover,  other Governments have found it perfectly practicable to adopt this or kindredexpedients,  and I see no reason to suppose that we should&quot;be unable to do the same.7.        It is further questioned whether the proposal would either be &quot;effective  or workable&quot;.   Everyindustry consulted has agreed,  first,  that it would be helpful to agriculture, in  other words &quot;effective&quot;, andthey have all agreed that  it oould be  &quot;worked&quot;.   Thedifferenoe of opinion has  arisen over  the proposed methodsof working.8.        k fear is expressed that the passage ofthe necessary legislation  through Parliament would raise &quot;formidable&quot; difficulties.   Whatever these difficulties are,  they are not  comparable with thosewhich will arise from the  confession of helplessnessthat would rCeult from the failure to  submit any helpful                                               proposals.
      proposals.    There is,  however,  good ground  for      supposing that the Quota proposals  would  receive      widespread supoort.9.             It has not  &quot;been suggested  that both      tnis scheme and the  Marketing  Bill  should necessarily      be pas.seu into law before the  Summer Recess. ,  Great      advantages might arise from their discussion,  and I-      suspect that a volume of public  support for  the      elementary principle that it was fair that a      reasonable proportion of British wheat should  find  its      way into British breed  would  he forthcoming.10.              There is,  of course, a grest deal  of &quot;interest&quot;      in the opposition of the flour importers,  but  the most      grotesque misrepresentation has  characterised  their      presentation of the  case in Canada.    As  a matter of fact      the proposa.1 would probably increase the  import of      Canadian hard wheat  or flour.    It  would  certainly  give      it a more secure market,  &quot;because it  would be required for      the admixture.11.              Subsidies  snd tariffs  are  ruled out.    The      Import Board to which we were  committed at the Election      is apparently in ao&amp;d&apos; storage, and  I suggesx that it is      a political impossibility,  and a certain  precursor  of      political disaster to present  our supporters with a      negative when they demand proposals  for the  assistance      and maintenance of the cultivation  of the land in England.IS.              The Chancellor states  that the  Secretary  of      State for Scotland would &quot;quite  reasonable-?&apos;  press for the      protection of the Scottish grower of oats by the      prohibition of imports or &quot;by countervailing  duties                                                     if
if the Wheat quota principle were adopted.   Why theprohibition of one import follows &quot;quite reasonably&quot;from the increased use of another home product,  Iam at a loss to understand.                      (initd.)
