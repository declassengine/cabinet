jMTHIS DOCUMENT lb THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC UAJBSWS GOVERNMENT).                              Cabinet.Secret                                                            *TO;&apos; 14g(S0)                                              Copy No,iww -.;                   STATUTORY QUOTA OF BRITISH bHEAT                              DT FLOUR.Note by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on the Memorandum                   by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.          1. The Memorandum circulated by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P.139 (30)) is based on oertain misapprehensions whiohI am anxious to remove at the earliest possible moment.           . At the outset, however,  I must draw attention to thefact that the White Paper issued by the last Government was published at a time (February 1926) when the price of British wheatwas 50/9 a quarter.  In February 1930, the price had fallen by nearly    per cent, to 38/7 a quarter.  It is inconceivable that thelast Government would have been content with their White Paper ifthey had been confronted with a crisis in arable farming such asthat which exists tffl-day.  In fact, the Conservative Party havealready revealed in no mistaken fashion their attitude to the present crisis and Mr.  Baldwin has announced his Party&apos;e intention,  whenreturned to power,  of guaranteeing a prioe for home-grown wheat ofmilling quality.          3. The object of the quota plan is not to  make wheat-growing in this country universally profitable,  but  to give justthat measure of encouragement to the  cereal grower which will inducehim to hold on  until prices improve.   It will give him this by a slightly better price and also by an assured market In the face of cheap and, in some  cases, bounty-fed  imports.  To the extent thatthe plan attains its object,  employment will be  maintained onarable farms and the adverse  reaction on the already over-suppliedmilk market will be averted.          4. It is  true that  theBoonomic Advisory Council hae setup a Committee  to consider the position of agriculture in the                                                        e c on omi c
jjeaottomic  life  of the country, but  the  Committee  has  only Just  b*onBap^pointed and  the Government will  not  be  allowed to  wait untilIfthis  Committee has reported on  the general  question  beforeBdeciding  on the particular issue which I  have ^ut before the cabinet.\           5. I do not  deny that the  quota plan,  to the  extent  thatgit succeeds, will increase the  cost  of flour, but, as I have, informed my colleagues, the effect on  the price  of the  loaf of ai fractional increase in the cost of the small percentage of our flour                 iI supplies  represented by flour from home-grown wheat, would beI altogether negligible.  In any  case, now  that consumers are gettingI the advantage  of very  cheap wheat,the  action contemplated by theI Quota plan, when the true facts are  known,  is likely to command1 public support as &quot;being a bare  measure of juetice^           6. On the question whether the  quota  is workable and will  be effective,  I e^n only say that  Dr.  Addiscn has gone  most care-  fully into the details with the Ministry&apos;s  Officers  and with the  various trade  organisations concerned  and that  he and I are satisfied  that  a quota system is workable and  can be  made  effective.  Responsible trade interests share  this view,           7. It can &quot;be anticipated that the Government  would secure  a  large measure of support from the  other Parties for the quota  proposal and I do not,  therefore,  agree that tho difficulties  of  passing the neoeesary  legislation  through Parliament are formidable.  The &quot;Manchester Guaxdian&quot; in a  recent  leading article approved the  quota principle.           8. It is true that it is proposed to  take  power to adopt  either of two methods  of applying  the  quota, although it is  intended to proceed by Method 2.                The reason  for  taking   power  to apply   either   Method  is partly                                                       the
   the experimental nature ox the feenexal^prooo-sei. and. par&amp;ly-- the   stroke-v support accorded to Metnod 1 by  the  English and   Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society&apos;s millers,  in common   with all millers^ although this Method puts  the  flour importer   at e aisedvanta. e.    It would be provided in  the Bill that  any   change from one Method to the other should  only be mace  by   Order which had been laid in dreft before parliament.    The   fixing and variation of the quota percentage  must,  of course,   be left to regulations, as in Germany and prance;   this  is   quite understood by the trade.   In these matters,  the Minister   would act in the closest consultation with all interests   concerned end there is, therefore,  no reason  to anticipate   any serious difficulty in practice.          9.  As the  Chancellor observes,  flour  is a necessity of   every-day life, but the All-English proportion  of our flour   supplies is not likely to exceed 20 per cent, fox many years to   come.   Coal is also a necessity of every-aay life, and  British   pits supply not 20  but 100 per cent,  of our needs,  yet the  Coal   Mines Bill confers  f: r greater powers on the  president of the   Board of Trade than anything contemplated in  the wheat quota   scheme.   whichever Method of applying  the  quota is used, there   is a safeguard for  all parties,  including the consumer,  in  the   Ministers power of varying the quota percentage.         10.  The objections detailed by the Chancellor in  Paragraph                                              I   12 of his Memorandum relate to Method 1 and/had already  drawn   attention to them.    On the Canadian point, however, I should   explain that although the Canadian Plour Millers would object to   the blending (under Method 1) of their  flour  at our ports,  the    general effect of  the quota plan would probably be to increase the   demand in this country for Canadian hard wheat  which, from  aI   milling standpoint, is complementary to our own.   The CanadianII   Minister of Trade  end Commerce has recently spoken in publio to1   this effect and it  is fully understood  by the Canadian WheatI   Pool,   AS regaras  Method 2,  it would                                  3.                        &apos; -  would
would not be difficult to show that the objections of thej^ritish milling industry are based on a narrowly selfishview and, in my opinion no satisfactory ease has been put .forward in support of them.  There may, of course, beopposition in parliament by any of the sectional trade-interests concerned, but at least the steady support of theagricultural interests of all parties should be assured.      11.  It is possible, as the Chancellor says, that some part of the benefit intended for the farmer will be intercepted by merchants.   The fact that this may happen to some extentwill be an added stimulus to farmers to or&amp;enise theirmarketing.   tfhe farmers are, however, quite ready to take their chance on this.   In airy csse, the fact that a fairproportion of the sales of home-grown wheat tre made direct tomillers without the intervention of the merchant is aconsiderable check on t^e merchant&apos;s operations.      12.  I do not admit that the difficulties of fixing ereasonable quota, percentage are as great as the Chancellorsuggests or even that miscalculation need be a serious matter.The criticism that local shortages may hold-up business doesnot, of course, apply to Method 2, while e producers&apos;Marketing Board, or some other form of organisation, oouldprevent such shortages arising under Method 1.      13.  I need hardly say that if the quota -lan does not raise the price of British wheat materially - and I do not anticipate that it will do so, et any rate for a time - theGovernment would only be committed to finding, some other methodto  secure tnct result if, when tue quota plan were announced, absurd claims were made by the Government regarding its purpose and likely exfeot,      14.  With regeru to the Scottish points, the complaint - of  the Scottish bakers relates to Method 1 and not to Method 2;                                                         in
453  .5*Tin any event, the Scottish Oo-operative Wholesale  Societydoes not consider the complaint  to be well-founded.  Naturally,the same quota percentage would  have to apply in Scotland asin England.   The Secretary of State for  Scotland, failingany other suggestion, may consider it desirable to press forthe prohibition of imports of bounty-fed  oats, but I submit that the merits of the wheat quota plan,  as  such,are entirelydissociated from that proposal.                                         N.E.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,      5th Hay, 1930.
