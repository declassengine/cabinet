WASHINGTON CONVENTION ON THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN                 BEFORE AND AFTER CHILD-BIRTH.               Memorandum by Minister of Health.          The Governing Body of the International LabourOffice at its meeting  in Paris on the 23rd April will considera Report on ths operation of the Convention on the Employmentof Women Before and After Child-Birth which was adopted at theFirst International Labour Conference at Washington in 1919.          In accordance with the terms of the Convention thisreport must be  presented to the General Conference not later than 1931, and  the Governing Body must also consider thedesirability of placing on the Agenda of the Conference thequestion of the revision or modification of the Convention.The British Government representative on the Governing Body will need instructions as to the line which h9 is to take with  regardto the desirability of the revision or modification of theConvention from the point of view of this country and, as  towhsther he should support the circulation with the Report  of any recommendation  to the Governments of the States members of theConference as to the revision or modification of the convention and, if so, in  what respects.          The main provisions of the Convention are that nowoman shall bo  permitted to work in any industrial or commercialundertaking during the six weeks following her confinement, andfurther that if she is employed therein she shall have the  rightto leave her work on production of a medical certificate stating
that her confinement will probably take place within six weeks,While a woman is absent from work in these circumstances shs isto be paid benefits sufficient for the full&apos;and healthymaintenance of herself and her ohild, and is also to receivefree attendance by a doctor or certified midwife.          The British representatives at the washington conference refrained from voting on the Convention and theBritish Government decided against ratification.          This decision was arrived at after considerationof a memorandum sent to the Cabinet on 4th October, 1920, byDr. Adclison, then Minister of Health, and of a Report by theGovernment Actuary on the financial aspect of the proposals,in which he estimated the cost at about  1,700,000 per annum.The Report by the Government Actuary was laid before Parliament(Command paper 1293).   The following developments in thiscountry sines that date add force to the decision which was thenarrived at:-     (1)  The Scheme under the Convention is restricted towomsn employed in industrial or commercial undertakings.  Inthis country maternity provision is being gradually extendedto all women of the industrial class, including domestic servants, agricultural workers, and the uninsured wives ofinsured men.     (2)  Maternity and Child Welfare Centres, Day Nurseries,Maternity Homes and Hospitals, and. Medical and Midwifery services have been considerably developed within the last ten years and afurther development on a considerable scale is under consideration.     (.3)  The amount of sickness and disablement benefit paid                                -2-
under1 the Health Insurance Act to married women has increasedby over 100 per cent, since the date of the Convention, andit is not unlikely that many employed married women receiveas much in the form of cash allowances under that Act (l.e.Maternity Benefit averaging  4/io/- and Sickness Benefit atan average rate of 15/- a week) as they would be entitled to under the terms of the Convention.   The Maternity Bensfit isintended to cover the four weeks immediately followingconfinement, during which the woman must abstain fromremunerative work, and in addition Sickness Benefit is payable for any period of incapacity for work before confinement or after the expiration of four weeks following confinement. Thepayment of benefit is not restricted (as under the Convention)to certain fixed periods, during part of which many of thewomen may be in fact fit for work and desirous of working.     (4)  The growing strength of the movement in favour ofmaternity provision-for all classes of women, and especially of the industrial class, emphasizes the forc6 of the argumentadvanced in 1920 that, so far as Great Britain is concerned,it would be impossible to restrict the Scheme to employedwomen in commerce and industry.   We should probably be driven to extend its provisions to all married women.  Itwas estimated in 1920 that this extension would cost about 15,000,000 per annum, but in view of the fall in the birthrat3 sines 1920 the cost at present would probably be somewhat lower.     (5)  In the event of the Exchequer being unable to find the whole of the money, it is pointed out that the introductionof the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act                               -3-
      has rendered any further increase In contributions      impossible for, at any rate, some time to coma.                The draft Report of the Governing Body states      that up to the present time the Convention has been ratified      by eleven countries only, viz. Bulgaria, Chile, Cuba,      Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Luxemburg, Rumania, Spain      and Yugoslavia.   The remaining 44 States members of the      International Labour Conference have not ratified the      Convention.                Of the eleven countries which have ratified the      Convention it would appear from the draft Report of the      Governing Body that soma have not yet made the provision      effective, while oth?rs hava only made the moat meagre      provision.                While I am entirely in sympathy with improved      provision being made for women during pregnancy and child-      birth, on which subject I may shortly have occasion to lay      proposals before the Cabinet, I am convinced that any      additional money which may be found available for this      purpose would not be most usefully applied in making the      provision proposed under ths Washington Convention.   In      these circumstances I am of opinion that the British      Government representative on the Governing Body should take      up a purely passive attitude and refrain from making any      suggestions as to the revision or modification of the      Convention.                                           (Initialled)   A.G.Ministry of Health.   4th April, 1930.                                    -4-
