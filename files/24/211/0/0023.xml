HOURS OF INDUSTRIAL  EMPLOYMENT BILL.                  Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.          1.   The Hours of Industrial Employment Bill circulated with          my Memorandum H.A. 18(30) has  been prepared on  lines already          approved by the Cabinet with a view to enabling us to          ratify the Washington Hours  Convention, and has been approved          subject to certain minor alterations by the Home  Affairs          Committee (H.as c.8th  Conclusions).  The Government have          promised to introduce it, if possible,&apos; before Easter and          there is another reason why  we should do this if  we can.          There is a meeting of the Governing Body of the International          Labour Office on April 24th, and  it would be very unfortunate          if we are still unable to say  that our pledge to  introduce          the Bill has been carried out.          2.    The Law Officers have advised that (except,  of course,          as regards underground workers in coal mines, as  to which see          paragraph 5(1)  below), the Bill will enable us  to  ratify the          Hours Convention.          3.    My oolleagues will recollect that I was authorised to          communicate the Heads of the Bill to the Trades Union Congress          General Council and to the National Confederation  of Employers *          Organisations and I have met  deputations from both  bodies as          well as deputations from Trade  Unions and employers&apos; organisa-          tions in a number of  industries.    I believe that  the Bill in          its present form will he generally satisfactory to  the Trades          Union Congress  General Council and that the special provision          for Railway Work (Clause 10(3)) meets the wish  of  the Railway          Unions that there should be  no  Interference with  the present          railway agreements and practice.    The only other  point of
substance raised by the Trades Union Congress G-eneral Council.was their objection to the exclusion of family businesses.This point was also made by the employers, particularly in theTransport and Printing industries.   The exclusion appears,&quot;however, in the Washington Convention, and to include suchfamily undertakings would involve most serious administrativedifficulty.4.   The employers, while making it clear that they were opposed in principle to legislation, discussed the details with me in a frank and helpful manner.   I believe that the Billgoes a long way to meet the points on which they laid stress,but we must anticipate that their general attitude will be one of opposition.5.   The provisions of the 2111 are described in the noteattached to H.A. 18(30) and I need only draw my colleagues&apos;attention to the following points:-    (1) Scope of Bill.        The scope of the Bill is that required by the    Convention which excludes agriculture, water transport    and commerce&apos;;   The Convention leaves it to each country    to define the line of division between these and industry.    Agriculture has been defined as in the Agricultural &quot;wages    (Regulation) Act.   The  crews of all vessels and (except    when in harbour) all persons employed thereon are excluded.        Clerical work as such is excluded as being commercial.    There would be great practical difficulty in distinguishing    between the different classes of clerks.        Distributive Trades are excluded including the ware-    housing and road transport which they perform for them-    selves. -  On the other r-..r.d, the business of the ware-    housing and transport of goods as such is covered. (See    Clause. 12(1) (f) and (g) ).                       &apos;  2.                        . -&apos;&apos;
     The Bill  does not  deal with underground workers, in coal mines who are to be  covered by separate legislation now before Parliament. (2)  Definition of Working hours (Clause 13).     The definition of Working Hours agreed at the London Conference was &quot;time at the disposal of the employer exclusive of  &quot;posted&apos; rest periods5&apos;.   I have had many representations concerning the special circumstances in different industries and the definition in the Bill is designed to avoid the principal difficulties. (3)  The Five day or shorter &quot;Week.     My colleagues will remember that there has been controversy as to the possibility under the Convention of permitting more than nine hours&apos; work on some days sosas to allow the 48 hours to be worked in five days or less.   This has been provided for in the Bill on condition that the workers&apos; organisations assent. (4)  Overt ime.     A serious obstacle to legislation hitherto has been the acceptance of the interpretation of the Convention in the sense that it does not permit the working of commercial overtime.   As a Party we have never accepted that view, and the Bill contains (Clause 5) a provision which.sets a limit to hours of overtime and permits the working of overtime in circumstances of the kind for which provision is usually made in collective agreements.  The Clause does not meet all the representations made to me by employers on this subject, for example, it has been strongly urged upon me that there are certain ,; continuous operations&quot; (e.g. cutting gear wheels, gun-boring, tanning) which when once begun must be completed without a break and often cannot be completed within 8 or 9 hours.   It may be a
are quite appropriate for such cases, but I do not thinkthat this need he an obstacle to the introduction of theBill in this form.          Other difficulties which have been pointed out to mecould probably be met by substituting for the limit of52 hours in 28 days a limit of 64 hours in 56 days, thusIncreasing the flexibilit:/ of this provision; but I should propose to make any such concession in the House, if it isfound expedient to do so.(5)  Emergency fork (Clause 6).          I should draw attention to the fact that the extendedhours of work permitted under this Clause may be worked bythe employees of one employer in the case of accident, etc.occurring not at his works but at another establishment(e.g. repair of machinery for a flour mill by anengineering firm).  The words &quot;Force majeure&quot;, which occur in the corresponding Article of the Convention, have notbeen used in this Clause because the term is not known toEnglish Law in this connection.  It is believed that theClause, which has been drafted in a restrictive sense,carries out the intention-of the Convention.(6)  Arrangement of Ordinary Working Hours.          A number of representations have been made to me asto difficulties which may arise -       (a)  as to which, processes will be regarded as            continuous processes;       (b)  as to what classes of work will be regarded as            preparatory or complementary work;       (c)  as to which classes of workers will be regarded            as engaged on essentially intermittent work;       (d)  as to difficulties which would arise in notifying            the hours of starting and finishing in certain            industries.
 All these matters will &quot;be dealt with by Regulations, which must, under Clause 10(2), be the subject of consultation* with employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations.      Objection may be taken to this wide use of regulations hut I believe that this course will be more acceptable to employers and trade unions than laying down rigid definitions and requirements by statute. (?)  Inspection (Clause 8).      The Bill ma;&apos;es provision for the appointment of Inspectors.  I should not propose, however, to appoint Inspectors under the Bill until the possibilities of assistance from the existing industrial inspectorate had been exhausted.  In any case we may properly looh to those engaged, in industry to taxe their part in securing the- observance of the law. (3)  having Clause as to more favourable conditions.        (Clause 15(1)).      The Trades Union Congress General Council attach importance to the declaration contained in this Clause, but they understand that it does not give any statutory force to existing industrial agreements.      The Bill, of course, only lays down maximum hours and minimum overtime rates and many collective agreements provide more favourable conditions in respect of both hours and wages.      I ask for authority to introduce the Bill at once.                                  (Intld.)  M.G.3. Ministry of Labour. 11th April, 1950.
