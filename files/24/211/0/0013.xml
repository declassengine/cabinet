THIS DC0UP3KT IS THE PRQPEP.TY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.S E 0 R E T.c.p. 115(507.                       CABINET.           FIRST REPORT OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE ON                    MINERAL TRANSPORT.         MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT AND THE                      SECRETARY FOR MINES.             We submit, for the information of our colleagues, a memorandum summarising the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Mineral Transport appointed in 1927 under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Duckham as a result of the recommendations  of  the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry.   Apart from minor matters, which are sufficiently described in the memorandum, there are three important recommendations contained  in this Report with a view to increasing efficiency and economy in Mineral transport.   They are closely connected together.       (1)   The Committee have unanimously come  to the  conclusion that  the principal obstacle in the way of the introduction of high capacity wagons is to he found in the fact that the terminal points, whether at ports and shipping places, ai private works and sidings, or at the collieries themselves, are not equipped to take 20-ton wagons on a  scale which makes the general use of such  wagons a practicable  and economical proposition.   Of the shipping appliances at the ports, less than half can accept  such wagons.   About 50 Per cent,  of the private sidings of the  principal works in the iron and steel and other metallurgical trades, gas and electricity works and works of other large consumers, can  accommodate such wagons.   At the collieries themselves pits representing  56% of  the total  output are unable to handle wagons of 20-tons  capacity.    It is obvious that these obstacles to the more general  use  of the  larger  wagons must be removed, or  he seen to be on their way to removal, before any rapid introduction of such wagons can be  looked for.            As  the Memorandum points  out, the Royal Commission appeared to  assume that the economies to be  gained in  various
                          - 2 -directions &quot;by the use of the larger wagons should provide thenecessary incentive for bringing about the desired change.   But theCommission were not possessed of the detailed information collected by the Standing Committee as to the difficulties at terminals andthe  cost of removing these difficulties.         A substantial part of the savings which will accrue fromthe use of larger wagons will be in railway operating costs andthe Railway Companies should therefore,in theory offer equivalentreductions in rates.   Bearing in mind,  however, that the earnings .of the Railway Companies according to the latest figures available(1928) fell far short of the standard revenue contemplated  ny theRailways Act, 1221, and that the prospects of any all round revivalin their traffics are uncertain, it cannot be supposed that therailways would voluntarily concur in any further reductions in their rates, and it is at least doubtful if the Railway Rates tribunal would feel able to impose any such reductions.   If, therefore,progress is to be made, the suggestion of the Committee that theprinciples of the Development Act, 1929, should be applied to thisparticular aspect of the modernisation of transport would seem to afford the only practicable line of early advance.         An extension of the Development Act in order to enableGovernment financial assistance of this kind to be given to privateundertakings might perhaps be said to open the door to demands that assistance should also be given to these and other privateundertakings (e.g. shipping companies) for other useful schemes,which they might put forward for the economic development of their undertakings.   The work in question is, however, as the Committeepoint out, essential to the re-equipment of the means of mineraltransport.   It can therefore be said to be technically rather thanin principle outside the scope of the existing legislation.         &apos;./e desire to point out that it would be futile toreconstruct railway and port terminals to take large wagons ifcollieries and industrial works are not also enabled to handle them.
         It would greatly facilitate matters if the RailwayCompanies could he induced to undertake the duty of acting asthe medium between the Government and the commercial undertakingsconcerned, and authority is requested to enable the Ministry ofTransport to enter into negotiations with the Railway Companiesaccordingly, and to frame any necessary legislation.    (2)  Given progress in this direction, the way would be clear to the prohibition of the further construction of wagons of lessthan 20-tons as from some date to be fixed in the near future.    (3)  The third important recommendation of the Committee isthat a scheme of compulsory pooling should, be imposed.   This isdisliked by certain representatives  of the coal industry whoserved on the Committee and who take the line that ever-ythingwill be for the best if the industry is left to itself.   Therecan, however, be little reasonable doubt, first, that importantsavings could be immediately achieved by a pooling of wagons,and, secondly, that the movement in this direction will be veryslow unless pressure is applied.   s/fe, therefore, think that theCommittee&apos;s suggestion under this head should be approved inprinciple and that they should be requested to proceed quicklyto work out its  practical application.         The Committee should be instructed to proceed upon the /assumption that Government finance or guarantee will not beavailable for this purpose.         The recommendation for the pooling of wagons fits in,  sofar as colliery owned wagons are concerned,  with the government policy, which aims at the concentration of the coal miningindustry into a much smaller number of producing units*   Bothlines of attack (the provisions of the Coal Mines Bill and theproposals of the Committee)  should mutually assist in attaining the common goal.
         A better organised coal mining industry must ultimatelylead t6 improvements in the present inefficient methods of  thecoal distributive trades and here again a definite policy forthe pooling of coal traders&apos; wagons will be very helpful.         We should also be glad to receive general authority tbdeal with the other recommendations of the Committee on thelines indicated in the Memorandum.         It may be pointed out that the Lord Privy Seal, whowas a member of the Standing Committee during the first twoyears of its existence, welcomed the Report of the Committee inthe speech which he made in the House of Commons on the 4thNovember last.   In view of the importance of the questions involved an early decision by the Government and announce -e ntof the policy to be adopted is desirable.         We should add that since the Report was issuedrepresentations have been received, from the Coal Trade and onbehalf of several bodies representing industrial undertakings,objecting to the principal recommendations of the Report.These objections relate mainly to the recommendation in favourof compulsory pooling of wagons (which it is alleged would be impracticable);  the standardisation of the 20-ton wagon (whichit is alleged would be uneconomical so far as large classes oftraffic are concerned);  and general reconstruction of terminals(which it is alleged would be impossible or unduly extravagantin many cases).   It is thought, however, that these objectionsare sufficiently met by the procedure contemplated by theCommittee and proposed to be adopted under which the actualdetails of any compulsory pooling arrangements would require tobe settled by the Committee after discussion with the parties concerned, and would not be applied compulsorily unless anduntil adequate progress had been made with these discussions;
 the  construction of wagons of  smaller capacity would not be prohibited unless and until reasonable progress had been made with the  reconstruction of terminals;  and the reconstruction of the terminals  would be a matter which would necessarily only be undertaken in those cases where the parties were prepared with the assistance of the Government subsidy toundertake it.(Intld. ) H.

MEHORAHDUM ON THE FIRST REPORT OF THE 8TANDI1TG COMMITTEE ON                     MINERAL TRANSPORT.       The first Report has &quot;been received from this Committee which was appointed by the late Government under the Chairmanship of Sir Arthur Duckham in February 1927 in accordance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Goal Industry (1925)  to review the  equipment available in connection with the transport of coal from the coalfields  to the ports internal  markets of the country, :..nd the methods of conducting such transport, and to devise  means  of promoting such  improvements in that equipment and its use  as will  lead to the greatest efficiency and economy in transport.      The  Report, in addition to furnishing a large volume of useful information not hitherto available in regard to such matters as the numbers and types of coal wagons at present in  use on railways, and the time occupied by such wagons in transit and at the terminals, makes  certain &quot;recommendations which have  for their ob 3 e c t; :(:l)  &quot;the adopt ion of - the 20-ton  wagon as - the standard wagon in this country end (2)  the compulsory formation of pools of privately-rowned wagons to reduce the number of operating units from something like 5,000 to 200.   There are. also other(recommendations of a  less sweeping character which are mentioned below.       The two main recommendations of&apos; the.. Committee were also the two principal recommendations  of the Royal Commission  but ..fter a vei-y* detailed -investigation, of..the problem of mineral  transport the Committee present their suggestions for dealing with these two matters in a substantially different form, from the Royal Commission.             1..:.: Adoption of -2Q^t05H^3S:^S::J^SS^pm*       As  regards 20-ton wagons the. Royal Commission suggested , that an estimate of the saving .in .railway,operating that might be expected: should be prepared, and the...companies should be  required
 to  pass  on the greater part of this saving in lower rates, the principle  applied by the  Groat Western Railway which allows a rebate of  5 per cent, on  all  coal carried in 20-ton wagons being adopted  as a first step in a  general policy.   The Commission apparently assumed that such  a policy would lead to a substantial increase in the use of the larger wagon.  But, although this policy has now been followed by the Great Western Railway for six years, the resulting number cf 20-ton wagons brought into use is small, although the Great We atom Railway has also spent considerable sums of money in adapting its port facilities to take 20-ton wagons.      The  Standing Committee were impressed with the experience of the Great Western Railway.    They were also informed of the efforts of some of the Wagon-building Companies to stimulate thebuilding of 20-ton wagons which had not been successful, and they came to the consclusion that the real stumbling block to the general adoption of the 20-ton wagon is the lack of facilities at terminal points to handle these wagons.  The Committee&apos;s first recommendation therefore in l^egard to 20-ton wagons is emphatically directed to the means for making their general usepossible.   The Committee prepared a rough estimate of the cost of converting existing terminals and arrived at- a figure of S8f million made up as follows:-       Collieries                    2,500,000       Ports            Privately-owned          1,250,000            Railway-owned            2,400,000       Railway Stations &amp; Depots       100,000 x       Private Sidings at         Industrial Works  (say;      2,500,000 xNote:   It is understood  that the figures given in respect of         Railway Stations  and  Depots and of Private Sidings are         regarded as underestimates by the interests concerned         and this may also be  the case in regard to Collieries.
    Assistance for reconstruction of terminal facilities. (1) Railways and Ports,         The Committee recognised that it was unlikely that any programme of reconstruction would &quot;be undertaken on such a scale as would make the adoption of the 20-ton wagon as the standard within a reasonable period unless substantial financial assistance were given.   They were informed by the representatives of the Railway Companies that so far as railways and railway-owned ports were concerned the Companies proposed to expend part of the capitalised value of the remitted Passenger Duty on the modernisation of their dock equipment.   In addition, however, the Committee suggested that the financial assistance contemplated under the provisions of the Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act, .1929, should, be accorded to all approved schemes designed to further the use of 20- ton wagons by the provision of improved terminal facilities at ports whether railway-owned or otherwise.   As all statutory port authorities rank as public utility undertakings the Development Act will cover such schemes.   No action is therefore needed on the. part of the Government in connection with this recommendation -other than- a notification to the Unemployment Grants Committees and theDevelopment Act Committee that the Government support the proposal. (2)  Collieries and Industrial Works.         The Committee recommend for the reasons given above that arrangements on the same lines and financial assistance of the same kind as is suggested for railways and ports should, in approved cases, be accorded to owners of collieries and private sidings, for the adaptation of screens and other necessary a3.terations, and suggest that &quot;the scope of the Development Act referred to shouldbe extended (by whatever machinery may be most suitable)  to cover this work, which is so essential to the development and re-equipment of the means of mineral transport&quot;.
         On the assumption that the Government feel able toaccept this recommendation serious difficulties may arise in giving effect to it mainly because of the possibility of soaewhatelaborate machinery having to be set up for the proper protection&quot;of Government financial interests in view of the large number of undertakings involved.  These objections and the difficulty ofmaking grants to private undertakings would to a large extent be met if arrangements could be made under which the works wouldbe carried out and the capital provided by the railway companyconcerned, under agreement with such owners as were prepared tomake satisfactory arrangements with the railway company for the repayment by instalments of the capital provided.         Whatever arrangement is made legislation willprobably be required as the Treasury Solicitor advises that itis doubtful whether, apart from any special provisions in theirprivate Acts, railway companies in general are entitled toapply their funds for such purposes.(5) Date and procedure for adoption of 20-ton wagon as      standard.         The Committee say that if their recommendation forthe adaptation of terminals is adopted and the necessaryreconstruction taken in hand for providing facilities to handle/20-ton wagons at all principal terminals, they further recommendthat after the 1st January, l&apos;)J2f provided by that datereconstruction has been or is in process of being carried out at the majority of such terminals, no wagons of smallercapacity than 20-tons shall be constructed for mineral transportunless permission is given to meet special circumstances, andthat all wagons constructed after that date shall conform toagreed standards.
&quot;     158 JM         The proper method of giving effect to this recommendationwould seem to &quot;be for the railway companies to deal with it &quot;by regulations made by them in pursuance of the Railways Clauses(Consolidation) Act, 1845.   Alternatively, the Minister ofTransport might deal with the matter so far as privately-ownedwagons are concerned, by means of regulations under section 1;5(5)of the . inistry of Transport Act, 1915*   It is suggested that theCommittee should be informed that this recommendation is inprinciple accepted by the Government, and be asked to state, indue course, the precise date at which they would recommend that theproposed restriction should become operative.         It is significant that apart from some reservations or financial points there is a  unanimous opinion on behalf of theCommittee in favour of the 20-ton wagons as the standard forthis country.                      11 * &quot;Pooling of Wagons.         The Committee agree with the Royal Commission thatpooling of wagons will lead to economies in mineral transport costs.   Tleir idea as to the initial size of the pools is,however, substantially different from that of the Rojral Commission.The latter mention large district pools of not less than , say,50,000 wagons, and they suggested that an estimate should be madeof the saving in railway operating which would result from theintroduction of such pools, the greater part of which was to be allocated to the wagon owners in the form of a rebate on thetransport of all coal carried in pooled wagons.         The Committee was supplied with information of the economies in railway operations which have resulted from thecommon user of railway-owned wagons, and they were informed by se veral of the colliery groups which have pooled theirwagon stock that considerable economies have been effected.
                      III!They have found it impossible, however,, to estimate the actualsavings in costs which are likely to accrue from pooling.on thescale suggested by the Commission, and they reached the concuusiou-:moreover that it will be best to make a start with smaller poolsof not less than, say, jJOOO wagons.         The Committee do not anticipate any substantialdifficulty as regards the pooling of wagons owned by collieriesand large factors but they point out that the pooling of wagonsbelonging to merchants, smaller factors and industrial, concernswill certainly raise many problems, and tbey recommend that aperiod of G months after the issue of the p.eport be allowed forthe interests concerned to submit.to the Committee proposals for meeting these difficulties, and they anticipate that it shouldbe possible to make such progress with these arrangements thatit would be practicable to fix a date (say 1st January 19*2)after which no privately-owned wagons would be allowed to run onthe public railways unless operated in connection with the recognised pool.         It is suggested that the Committee should be informedthat this recommendation is accepted in principle, and asked toreport the result of their further consideration of the matter,                  III. Use of y agogo for Storage p.;rpoe.es                                     r.nd                       Demurrage and a&apos;:&apos;. d:ng Rent Charges,         The Committee regard it as very important that, collieriesshould provide as much siding accommodation as possible, so asto be able to provide wagon standage which will enable them tolevel out any variation in production and demand.   They also consider it essential  that adequate arrangements should be madeto allow of a proper reserve of coal in wagons being maintained at ports and shipping places.   The Committee also state thatthere are occasions when storage of  coal in wagons for limitedperiods at places other than collieries and ports can bejustified so long as the wagons are on a storage siding, do
not have to be shunted during their.period of standing and do notcongest traffic or cause extra costs in other ways.         The Committee do not recommend any change at present inthe existing ,charge for demurrage but in order to secure a betterturn round of wagons, which they regard as essential, theCommittee recommend that the charge for siding rent on bothrailway-owned and privately-owned loaded wagcns used for landsale traffic should (with certain exceptions) be increased from6d. to 1/- per day.         This is a matter which, under the existing law, Is withinthe discretion of the railway companies subject to an appeal to theRailway Rates Tribunal in case of dispute.         Railway Companies might accordingly have their attentionspecially drawn to this proposal with a view to its being put Intooperation as quickly as possible.         As being also likely to assist in the direction of betterworking the Committee urge the railway companies to give special attention to the prompt working of loaded wagons and  the -return ofempty wagons, and state that close co-operation on the part  of therailways and the traders In this matter would do much to improve the wagon user.         The recommendations, other than that relating to sidingrent, which is specially dealt with, might be brought to the noticeof the interests affected.              lv* Sales Depots at Railway Stations.         The Committee recommend for the consideration of colliery owners and large coal factors and merchants  the possibility  of setting up Sales Depots at railway terminals for the  provision of asuitable variety of coals for the local coal merchant or smallindustrial consumer.   They consider that an arrangement of  thiskind would do much to relieve shunting, and  would eliminate  a gooddeal of the overhead charges which present methods entail and whichIncrease the costs to the consumer.         This recommendation also might be brought to the n*tlce ofthe interests referred to as being a stop also in the directionof improving the present methods of retail coal distribution.
    v*  Powers to require Wagon Owners  to furnish Returns.         The Committee recommend that  the Government  Departmentsconcerned should have the statutory right to require  all owners of wagons to furnish returns,  giving such particulars of theirwagon stock as may be necessary.   The railway companies alreadyrender such returns to the Ministry of Transport in accordancewith the Railways Act, 1921.         This is a very desirable proposal, and the opportunityof any legislation might be taken to give effect to it.         The usual safeguard as to treating as confidential theinformation so supplied should be included.   VI. Iowqr aabga forconveyance of coal in large consignments.         The Committee emphasise the fact that the purchase anddistribution of coal in small lots increases shunting and thegeneral costs of mineral transport.   They point out that theco-operative selling of coal in colliery areas is being developed, and that co-operative buying will follow, thus tending to larger consignments of coal.   They state that undoubtedly the best incentive to obtaining the improved working conditionsindicated in their report would be the granting of relativelylower rates for the conveyance of coal in large consignments andin high capacity wagons, and they recommend that the railway rates Tribunal, in fixing or approving rates for coal traffic,should take this, factor into consideration.         This is the only definite recommendation which theCommittee make as to the lowering of railway freight rates ariringout of the Improvement in mineral transport which their recommendations envisage.         The Committee conclude their report by stating that &quot;itis difficult to estimate the financial benefits that will accrueif the above recommendations are put into force, but we aresatisfied that they will be appreciable.   The transport of
m 9 -162 JM-of minerals will become more  efficient and  the  better  service at terminals will immediately benefit the producer  and theconsumer&quot;.         The representatives  of the coal trade  on the  committee made great efforts to induce  the representatives of the RailwayCompanies to agree to some definite proposals for passing  onthe benefits of lower transport- costs which it  was  generally believed would accrue.   The  Railway Companies1 representatives,however, stated that they could not bind their  boards  to any definite proposals, and that  in bringing about  improvements in transport the Railways would have to make  considerable financial outlay.   They argued that, if the CommitteeJsproposals do result In lower operating costs, traders  will notbe slow to appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal.   This attitude-of the Railway Companies probably makes it undesirable to  press the Committee as a preliminary to any further action in thedirection of making estimates of the  savings in costs  of their various proposals.   They could make no progress without the active assistance of the Railway Companies, though the Companiesthemselves should be able If they wished to produce usefulfigures.   There Is a unanimous expression of opinion in two orthree places in the Report that the adoption of the Committeefsproposals will result&apos; in a lowering of transport costs and anyattempt at an apportionment of these savings had better be leftover until a later stage.         The Committee might, however, be asked to  consider further, in due course, the question of introducing relativelylower rates for traffic consigned in 20-ton wagons, and toindicate their views as to the nature and extent of any alterations in existing railway rates which might be&apos;^made  withthis object.         The attitude of the  representatives of the RailwayCompanies was probably mainly responsible  for the reservations
made by certain members of the Committee representing the CoalOwners and Coal Merchants.   See reservations on pages 48 - 50signed by Messrs. Heath and Hardie (Coal Owners&apos; representatives and Mr. Cooper (Coal Merchants&apos; representative).   Therepresentatives of the Coal Factors and of the Coal Exporterssigned the Report without any reservations.   The reservationsby Messrs. Lewis and Nelson representing Wagon Building, Hiringand Financing Companies is probably largely due to a fear thatthey may find it difficult to secure admission of their wagonsinto the wagon pools on terms satisfactory to them.
