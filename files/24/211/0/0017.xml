      Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.     I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues amemorandum concerning the proposed amendments to the covenant of the League of Nations.                        (Intld.)  A.H.Foreign Office.   4th April, 1930.                      M EM 0 R A N D U M.     In their speeches to the last Assembly of the Leagueof Nations the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State forForeign  Affairs proposed that the Covenant should be broughtinto harmony with the Pact of Paris by the elimination of theright of Private far which the Covenant at present allows,  but which the Pact forbids.    The Secretary of State, with thesupport of six other delegations, moved a formal resolution on the subject, which the Assembly accepted.   Sir C. Hurst,on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, put forward detaileddraft amendments which the Legal Committee of the Assemblydiscussed at length.   At the request of&apos;the Assembly, withthe consent of the British delegate, the Council in January                           1.ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.                                                  ^                                                     COPY NO. iCP.   117 (50).                                               *                                C A B I N E T.                     PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE COVENANT                           OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.
           last appointed an expert Committee to examine the whole           question and to make proposals for the consideration of the           next Assembly,,                This Committee, of which Lord Cecil was a member;  has           now made a unanimous report.   The draft amendments which it           has drawn up are in substance identical with those put  forward            by Sir C  Hurst in last September on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s           government   with the addition of certain provisions which           will strengthen the powers of the Council to secure the           pacific settlement of international disputes.                The amendments proposed are in Articles 12,  13 and 15           and their effect is as follows:Article 12.        This Article at present prohibits a &quot;resort  to war&quot;           until three  months after an award by arbitrators,  or a           judicial decision, or a report by the Council.                This limit is swept away by the proposed amendments,          -and the Article now prohibits absolutely any resort to  war           for the solution cf an international dispute.                It is understood that, as has always been the case,           the phrase &quot;a resort to war&quot; does, not include  (l)  a defensive           war,  and (2)  a forcible action to prevent war  in pursuance           of Article 16.Article IS,       Only paragraph 4 of this Article was dealt with.           That  paragraph at present  makes  it obligatory  on members  of           the League to carry out an award and not  to  resort to war           against any  one who complies with it, and it gives power  to           the Council  to propose  steps to  be taken  to  give effect           to such award.                As amended the  paragraph will retain the  obligation           to carry out  the    award while providing  that  no member of           the League must take any action  against it,  and also will           retain  in a  slightly strengthened form the rights  of the
 Council to  give  effect  to  the   award,  and will provide specifically that  in any decision  of the Council the votes of the  representatives  of  the parties  to the dispute will not he  count e d.      In Article  15  the  Committee dealt with both paragraphs 6  and 7,    Paragraph 6  at  present  provides that where there is a  unanimous report by the Council on a dispute likely to lead to  a  rupture, the  members  of the League are not to go to war against a  state  which complies with the provisions of that  report.      As  amended  a unanimous retort by the Council will be given the same force as  an award of arbitrators.    It will be obligatory on the members of the League, and the Council will  be  empowered to propose suitable steps to give it effect.      paragraph 7 in  its  existing form allows any member of the League  to go to war  if the Council are unable to reach a  unanimous&apos; report, provided that he does not go to war until three months after that report has been issued.      Under the new amendment, no member of the League may resort to war, even if the  Council cannot reach a unanimous report.    And if that happens, the Council are to take any steps, including especially a reference to the Permanent Court of Justice for an advisory opinion, which will meet the case.      The result of these amendments will be that  the right of private war under the existing Covenant will be wholly removed, and aggressive war will thus in all circumstances constitute a violation of  the Covenant.&apos;   It is sometimes said  that this&apos; will involve what is called an &quot;extension&quot; of the commitments of Article 16,  since under the amendedArticles 12, IS and 15,  Article 16 will apply in certain
theoretically possible cases of war in which under  theexisting articles it vrould not axoply.     It must &quot;be pointed out, however,  that  the  word&quot;extension&quot;  can only &quot;be used in this connection in  a  purelyof Article 16 in the terms of a large number of future  wars,some of which would involve violation of the present CovenantLeague will be able to prevent all wars between smallstates.   The only danger of having to apply Article 16lies in the risk of a war in which big States are involve d.-If the League fails to in re vent such a war, we may be sure that when the war is over its constitution will be radicallyre-cast.    We have, therefore, to consider not a large numberof possible cases of war, but rather one crucial test war;and the real question is whether the proxoosed amendments willmake.the outbreak of such a test war more or less likely.If they were, to increase the risk of such a war,, they would&quot;extend&quot; the commitments of Article 16.   But it seems plain that to take the right of private war out of the Covenant,and to outlav; aggression in all circumstances, can onlyserve to divert the thoughts and policies of Governmentsaway from war,  and thus to reduce the risK that  aggressionwill, in fact,  occur.    In so far as they do this theproposed amendments must reduce rather than &quot;extend&quot; the realburden of the commitments of Article &quot;16, by reducing the probability that they will ever be called into play.     It should be added that the risk of aggression is stillfurther reduced by those of the amendments which strengthen the powers of the Council to secure the pacific settlementof international disputes.    The risk would be still furtherdiminished when we have secured the general acceptance of thetechnicalsense.It is absurd to thinx of the application and others of which would involve only the violation of the pact of Paris.It is plain from experience that  the
&quot;     I77General Act which provides for the arbitration of disputesof every kind.     It is further said that the proposed amendments mayoffend, or alienate American opinion.    It need only he said in reply that since September last there has been noadverse American comment, whether official or unofficial,of any kind, and that some at least of the members of theAmerican delegation in London are known to view the amendments with a wholly friendly eye.Foreign Office.   3rd April,  1930.
