THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1930.SECRET.CP. 114  (30)(Also Paper No. E.A.C. (H.) 80.)                                 CABINET.THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.            Report  of the Channel Tunnel Policy Committee of the                         Economic Advisory Council.    1.  AT their meeting held on the  13th March, 1930 (E.A.C. Second Meeting,Conclusion (1)), the Economic Advisory Council appointed a Committee-    to prepare recommendations for submission  to His  Majesty&apos;s Government for    the action to be taken on the following questions arising out of the Report of the    Channel Tunnel  Committee      (i) if,  on the publication of  the  Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee,           sufficient evidence were forthcoming to satisfy His Majesty&apos;s Government           that the funds required for the construction of the British section of the           Tunnel could be  provided by private enterprise, should His Majesty&apos;s           Government, so far, as regards economic grounds, give their approval to           the construction of the  Tunnel;    (ii) if it appeared that the required financial support would not be forthcoming           to enable  the Tunnel to be built by private enterprise, was the evidence           in the Report  regarding the advantages  of  a Channel Tunnel  to &quot;the           country as a whole sufficient to justify His Majesty&apos;s Government either;          K(a) itself  constructing the Tunnel, or (b)  giving financial  assistance to           enable it  to be  constructed ?    2.  The Committee is composed as  follows :            Sir Andrew Duncan (Chairman).           Mr. E. Bevin.           Sir John  Cadman, G.C.M.G.           Mr. J. M. Keynes, OB.           Sir Alfred Lewis.           Mr. G. C. Upcott, C.B., Deputy  Controller of Supply Services, Treasury.          - Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E. (Secretary),    3.  We have interpreted our Terms of Reference  strictly, and have confined our consideration to  the  actual questions set to us by the Council, which we answer asfollows : 1     (i)  If, on the publication of the  Report of the Channel Tunnel Committee,           sufficient  evidence is forthcoming  to satisfy His Majesty&apos;s Government           that the funds required for the construction of the British section of the           Tunnel can be provided by private enterprise, we  are of  opinion that           His Majesty&apos;s Government,  so far as  regards economic grounds, should           not withhold their consent to the construction of the Tunnel, on the clear           understanding  that  if private enterprise commences the operation and           fails to  carry the venture through, they cannot call upon His Majesty&apos;s           Government for a subsidy or  for financial support.    (ii)  If it appears that the required financial support will not be forthcoming           to enable  the Tunnel to  be built by private enterprise, we are of opinion           that the evidence in the Report  regarding the advantages of a Channel           Tunnel to the country as a whole is not sufficient to justify His Majesty&apos;s           Government either  (a) itself constructing the Tunnel  or (b)   giving           financial assistance to enable it to be  constructed.Copy  Nc.38[20831]  [20872]
    4.  In giving a negative answer to the second question referred to us, we haveabided. literally by our terms of reference, whereby we are limited to the evidenceactually contained in the Report.  On this evidence we are unanimous in regardingthe case as not proven.   But we ought to add that the Report contains little or no material on some of  the matters which seem to us to be most relevant in arriving ata decision.    5.  In  particular,  (a) the Report contains no estimate of the revenue to beexpected from the Tunnel; and (&amp;) the  question of the types of new traffic to be created by linking up  the  British railway system with the Continental railway system receives very cursory treatment,  as compared with the question which is from  the  national point  of view  of  secondary importance as to the amount ofexisting traffic (and traffic which  will anyhow come into existence in the years tocome, whether the Tunnel exists or not) which will be diverted  from alternativeroutes.  If the matter is to be considered from the national point of view, the case for the Tunnel must stand or fall  by  the particular advantages to British industryand enterprise of linking up our railway system to the European system; and bythe answer to the question whether the result of constructing the Tunnel would bethat traders would in all cases have the choice of either the sea route or, alternatively,the land  route, with the attendant advantages of  rapid transit  and the avoidance of handling.       &apos;    &apos;6.  Further,  we are of the  opinion that if the construction of the Tunnel couldbe shown to be in the national interest, there would be a strong case for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment undertaking or participating directly in the enterprise.  For it wouldbe a case  where regard should be had to the fact that  the whole of the nationaladvantages could scarcely be expected to accrue in terms of  cash to the owners ofthe Tunnel itself. ...
