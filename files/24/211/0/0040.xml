On the instructions,  ox&quot;  the  Cabinet Coimuittee,  an Inter--Departmental Sub-Committee, under the  Chairmanship of Sir  JohnShuckburgh, composed of representatives of-the Treasury, Foreign-Office. Colonial Office, Admiralty,  War Office,  Air Ministry andthe Board of Trade, have considered what action should be  taken inview of tho recommend at ions contained  in the Beport (CP.  136 (30))of the Cabinet Committee,  to  ensure  that tho needs of His  Majesty ^Government and tho Iraq. Government  are met in the  event of aBa^h d ad- Lie dit e r r an e an Bailway and Pipeline with  a  Syrian terminalbeing constructed.   It has not been possible in the time  availableto make a complete orsmination of the  question,  and the Inter-Departmental Committee have accordinsly limited themselves tosetting out the following  material  considerations .   2. It is assumed th ?,t,  In  reoommonding the opening of negotiations with the French  Govornment at as early a date aspossible, tho Cabinet Committee were mainly influenced .by  theimportance which Sir John  Cadman  att chad to such  negotiationstailing place before the Iraq  Petroleum Company have  become finallycommitted to the Tripoli route.   Kay in   regard to the greatcomplexity and difficulty  of  the  whole situation,  and to theimportant and varied interests Involved,  the Sub-Committee, venture to suggest the desirability ox postponing any negotiations withthe French Government for  a short period so as to-1-
 enable the views of the Iraq Government  to be  obtained on new proposals of vital concern to Iraq,   In this connection, it must be pointed out that  the  whole  situation has recently been profoundly modified by the information which has reached His Majesty&apos;s Government of  an impending decision by the Iraq Petroleum Company in favour of  a northern alignment for the proposed pipeline.    The  hope of securing a southern alignment to Haifa passing  throughout across territory under British influence weighed largely with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the support which they have hitherto accorded to the Company.   The Company have now come to the conclusion that, on economic grounds, a Syrian terminal is preferable to Haifa.   The 5&apos;rench Government through its nationals on the  Company has  had every opportunity of becoming well acquainted with the whole position, and in particular with the reasons influencing the Company in favour of the northern alignment.  &quot;While the Sub-Committee agree that it is important that negotiations should be opened with the French  Government                                               and  while before the Company have ta :en a final decision   /the situation is sti 1 &apos;.iykomewhat fluid, they see no reason  to  suppose, that any advantages would be lost by postponing  the negotiations at least until the views of the Iraq Government have been received and considered. 3.        The Sub-Committee consider that there can  be no justification for leaving; the Iraq Government  any  longer in ignorance of the latest developments in the  situation.  It would be extremely embarrassing if, at a later stage, the Iraq Government were to accuse the British  Government of having withheld important information at a  critical  stage  in the history of the case.   The Sub-Committee accordingly propose that a telegram in the form attached ( see  Appendix) should be sent to the High Commissioner for  Iraq,  authorising                          -2-.,.

him to acquaint the Government of Iraq, with the main          W &quot;       Woutlines of Sir John Cadman&apos;s latest proposals.4,        It should he noted that, in the Memorandum attachedto Sir John Cadman&apos;s letter to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs of the 20th March, 1930,  it is stated.inconnection with the proposed International Company whlciiis to undertake the whole project for railways and pipeline,that certain guarantees will he necessary to inspire confidence in the investing public.  One  of these is to  hean overriding guarantee by the British and French GovernmentsIt is understood that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated that, in his view, the British Government should  in no circumstances      incur any liability in connection witha railway which ends at Tripoli..   In these circumstances the Sub-Committee suggest that Sir John Cadman should be warned in struct confidence not to expect any overridingguarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government in respect of a railway and. pipeline along the northern alignment.                                          in .        The Sub-Committee recommend that/the negotiationswith the French. Government every effort should be made tosecure that the requirements of the British Governmentin regard to the following specific points are satisfied:-          (a)      . An assurance from France should be               obtained that in time of peace, or when               France is a neutral,, or an ally, the French               Authorities will place no restriction on the               export of oil to British ports, including               Malta..  They could be informed, of course,               that we would do nothing that involves making.               Tripoli a base of supply to H.M.Ships or               the Fleet direct.
(b)  The Iraq-Mediterranean railway when constructed     will open up a route  which will  facilitate  the     rapid transport of  troops,  aircraft,  supplies     and munitions to Iraq and India,  and  will thus     &quot;become of great strategical importance.  It  is     essential that agreement  to the  trans-Syrian     route should he conditional on the grant of     facilities for the  transport  of  troops, aircraft     supplies and munitions (l)  in peace and (2)     - in so far as may  be compatible  with the     principles of International Law  and with the     obligations of the  parties  concerned  towards the     League of Nations - in the event  of a  war affecting     the security of Iraq  or British  interests in     the East.   The conditions  governing  the trans-     port of troops over the Gilician railway, in so     far as these conditions would apparently net be     operative  in the event of  one or other or     the contracting parties being neutral in a     conflict in &quot;which the other party was engaged,             a              .     &quot;     are not7&apos;completely  suitable precedent.(c)  An attempt should be  made to  secure the     placing in Great Britain  of a fixed proportion     of orders for railway and pipeline material.(d)  So far as requirements of the Iraq Government     may be concerned, it  will be  necessary  to     await the reply to  the proposed  Telegram to     the High Commissioner of  Iraq.(e)  The proposal&apos; to connect Haifa by rail with             prima facie     Tripoli is/desirable.  Any further
          points on which Palestine is interested must          await the vie&apos;-us of the High Commissioner fur          Palestine to whom it is suggested that the          Telegram referred to in paragraph 3 above,          should be repeated.6.   The requirements Indicated above are of course in amplification of and not in substitution for the varioussafeguards contained in the Syrian Mandate (as regardscommercial equality) and the San Feme Agreement ofApril 25th,  1920 (as regards refining facilities atTripoli, etc.)Signed on behalf of the Sub-Commit, t         jg;i.

                                    SECRET .                                    NO.__                                        My telegram No.      Information furnished confidentially to Ii.M.Government indicates that a decision by the Iraq petroleum company in favour of the northern alignment for theirpipeline, with Tripoli as the Mediterranean terminal,is now almost inevitable,, owing to the very substantialsaving both in initial capital expenditure and running-costs which would result from the adoption of thatroute as compared with the southern alignment toHaifa.    Cadman suggests that the present opportunity,before a definite decision has been reached by theCompany, should be taken to attempt by negotiation withthe French Government to secure.such political andeconomic concessions as would to some extent counteract the objections to the northern route.    In particularhe suggests that a comprehensive agreement should be negotiated dealing inter alia with the Son Memo  Agreement,the adjustment of outstanding questions in the middle east, and providing for railway and pipelineconstruction.      In the latter connection he proposesthe formation of an international company to undertake the financing,  construction,  maintenance, working and management of (1)  a railway from Haifa to Baghdad via        Horns andTripoli/ &apos;  Tikrit,  and (2)  a pipeline  from Tripoli toTikrit.   This would,  he suggests, have the effect of limiting to some extent French control&apos;over the pipeline and ral railway by removing the matter from the
-    45   4%political to tiie economic and commercial sphere.    Hecontemplates that the capital of the company would.for the most part he subscribed by-the public, including  -Iraqi, Syrian and Palestine nationals, but that theIraq Petroleum Company would have a substantialholding.    In order to stimulate public investment he suggests that the following safeguards-would be necessary (1) a certain proportion of theIraq Government&apos;s oil royalties to be ear-marked inrespect of the portion of the railway falling within Iraq,a limited guarantee on the part of the Syrian Governmentin respect of the portion of the railway lying inSyrian territory, (3) a guarantee by the Iraq petroleum company of a sum against a minimum through-put of oil,and (4) over-riding guarantees by the British and. french governments.   (is regards (4),  I should explain that thereis no prospect of His majesty!s Government giving sucha guarantee.)     As regards the proposed adjustment of outstanding questions in the Huddle Phut, suggestion is that it might include inter alia (a)  a settlement of tho Iraq-Syrianfrontier, and (b) some arrangement whereby the FrenchGovernment -would undertake not to oppose Iraq1s admission to the League in 1932.    There is, of course,  no evidencethat either (a) or (b)  would be attainable and in any caseadvantage of raising (a)  in&apos; this connection is more thandubious.                     (ii)
      Sine qua no 11 of negotiation  of suggested  comprehensiveagreement would Toe  (1)  Iraq Governments acceptanceof northern alignment for pipeline, and (.2) their co-operation &quot;botii as regards scheme lor constructionof railway and pipeline and as regards revision of iraq petroleum Company^ Convention of 19 5.     Unless you see strong objection you should at onceexplain the position as set out above to the Iraq. Governmentin the strictest confidence and without mentioningCadman&amp;s name or giving any indication of source ofabove suggestions.     You should ascertain and reportto me by telegraph (a)  whether they agree that negotiations for the conclusion of a comprehensiveagreement should bo opened with the French Government,(b)  whether they approve and will co-operate in the schemefor *,he formation of an international company to operate the pipeline and railway to Tripoli, (c)  if answer to(a)  and (b)  is in the affirmative, what special safeguardsand concessions they would wish His 2.1a j est;/&apos; s Governmentto attempt to secure in the negotiations with theFrench Government.     I should also be glad to learn whether in your own opinion a decision in favour of the northern alignmentis likely to affect the attitude of Iraq. government regarding proposed new agreement with the Company and if so in what manner.
