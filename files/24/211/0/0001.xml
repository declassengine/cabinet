THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.                    Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1930.COPY  NO.    21CABINET.NEW  TEEATY  WITH  IRAQ.       Memorandum by  the  Secretary  of State for  the  Colonies.    AT  their meeting on the 26th February (Cabinet 12 (30),  Conclusion 3) theCabinet approved a Draft Despatch of Instructions to the High Commissioner forIraq giving cover to a Memorandum of Proposals for a new treaty with Iraq.  TheDraft Despatch was duly issued in the form approved by the Cabinet.    Shortly after the Cabinet reached  their decision, however, it was represented tome by  the Foreign  Office  that they  would  be  seriously  embarrassed  in  the conversations which are about to be held with the Egyptian Government  on thesubject of the Draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,  if certain provisions of the proposed settlement with Iraq had in the meantime been communicated to, and accepted by, theIraq Government.  The provisions in question were those contained in Proposals 3and 4 of the Iraq Memorandum (Annexure 2 in CP.  45 (3)),  which  reproducedalmost in terms  the 5th and 4th paragraphs  respectively of the Proposals  for an anglo-Egyptian  Settlement (Cmd. 3376).    It Avas  evident that a situation had arisen which was not before the cabinet when  they  approved the Draft Instructions to Sir F. Humphrys,  and  that some modification of  those instructions was necessary.   A. telegram was accordinglyprepared in consultation with  the Foreign Office and was despatched to the HighCommissioner on the 6th March.  A paraphrase of the telegram is appended to thisMemorandum. My colleagues will see that the effect of  this telegram is merely to suppress  one sentence  of Proposal 3 of the Iraq Memorandum and to introduce  asmall verbal amendment into Proposal 4.    I am satisfied that these modifications will not appreciably weaken the positionof the High Commissioner  in his negotiations with the Iraq  Government;  but  report the matter in order  that  the Cabinet may be  aware that there has  been  a.departure, though an unimportant one.  from the text which they approved.                                                                        P.    February 19, 1930.  Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High                            Commissioner for Iraq.                       (Sent 9-20 p.m. 6th March, 1930.)(Confidential and Personal.)    NEW Treaty with Iraq.  Since my despatch of 5th March was approved by theCabinet a  new situation has arisen.   I  learn  from  the  Foreign  Office that an egyptian Delegation is expected to arrive here  about  the 28th March, in order todiscuss the Draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.   It is understood that the  egyptian government are desirous of avoiding the obligation which was imposed upon themby paragraph 7 (first sentence) of  the Proposals  for an Anglo-Egyptian Settlementpublished in 1929, namely, the engagement to render us assistance-as an ally in thecase of some war remote from Egypt.  If  the Egyptians can thereby be induced, intheir turn,  to forgo the onerous reciprocal obligations imposed on this country by      [20803]SECRET.CP. 101 (30).
 the present 4th and 5th paragraphs, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to meet them on  this point.   The following are the  modifications which we hope to obtain in these paragraphs :      The 4th paragraph to be amended to read as follows :           &quot; should any dispute between Egypt and a  third State produce, &amp;c.&quot;     The 5th paragraph to be amended by the deletion of the second sentence, and the introduction, in its  place, of the first sentence in Proposal 3 of the Memorandum of Proposals for an Anglo-Iraqi Settlement enclosed  in my despatch of the 5th March.     Discussion of proposed  modifications with the Egyptians is not possible until the  arrival of their Delegation in London.  In the meantime  the  Foreign Office, although anxious not to tie your hands  in  regard  to the discussion of  analogous clauses in the  Iraqi proposals, consider it would seriously prejudice their position if, pending  discussion  with the Egyptian Delegation,  Proposals 3  and 4 in their present form had already been offered to, and accepted by,  the Iraq  Government.&quot;Consequently, should it become necessary for you to discuss these two Proposals with the Government of Iraq at the present stage, your  instructions  should  be regarded as being modified in the following sense : ;   :  (1) Proposal 3. Third  sentence should be omitted.     (2) Proposal 4. The opening words should read :             &quot; should any dispute between  Iraq  and a third State produce, &amp;c.&quot; Above modification of  Proposal  3  will  not, I trust,  cause   you  any  difficulty. Proposal 4  is of  special importance.   It supplies  the condition precedent  to Proposal 5,  upon which in turn hinges the all-important Proposal  7.  But  it can scarcely  be supposed that we should feel compelled in  practice to consult Iraq  in regard, for example, to a dispute between one of the Great Powers and ourselves in which Iraq had no direct concern.  Thus the modification now proposed does no more than bring Proposal 4 into closer relation with realities.
