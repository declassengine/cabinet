PHIS DOCJMBIjT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.JRETMOV (30 )Copy No28CABINET,                TRADE  OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     The general tone of the reports was again decidedlydull, particularly those from tho cotton and wool industries and from shipping.  As regards the first industry, it wouldappear that recovery must await the exhaustion of stocks.  Inthe wool trade all indications pointed to a steady declinewhich was particularly ba.  in the dyeing anck.finish.ingestablishments, where the maximum employment was not morethan from 25-30 hours per week.  The hosiery industry was alsomore depressed than it has been for a long time, while reference was made to the uncertainty in the artificial silk trade.Even in the chemical trade, which had lately shown some strength,the situation at the end of the month was disappointing,especially In heavy chemicals.     Iron and steel showed no improvement.     The general position of shipping was reported to be thatcargo ships could hardly obtain freights in any part of theworld which would cover the cost of the voyage, while the index number for shipping freights for February was 19% below theaverage of 1913.  The costs, it was stated, were about 65/&amp; above that average, and the laying-up of ships was proceeding withsome rapidity.     Reports as to the shipbuilding industry which were receivedfrom several sources were conflicting but on the whole itappears to emergo that, while the immediate position is notunfavourable, the prospects are poor, new orders -beingdifficult to secure.                                                      /The
     The coal trade had continued good during February but was still apprehensive of the immediate future as orders werenot coming forward readily.  Polish competition was againthreatening.     This general complaint of bad trade was consistent withthe unemployment figures which, instead of showing as usual asubstantial improvement in February as compared with January,showed a rise of 47,000 between the end of January and the endof February.  The increase in unemployment was more marked Inthe North of England than in the South, there still beingevidence of a tendency for industry to flourish more in theSouth than in the older Industrial districts of the North.     In connection with the general economic position (of whichthe above particulars after all relate to what is probably a temporary phase), some importance attaches to statements madeby two of the members of the Council upon certain current economic tendencies.  In the first place, the Trade Unionmember representing the building trade gave it as his opinionthat In that trade the output per man employed is half as muchagain as before the war, so that even when that trade should beagain &apos;booming&apos; It cannot be expected that all the men normallyengaged In it will find employment.     The other instance of economic tendency was illustrated bythe representative of India in the methods which have beenadopted to bridge, or close, the gap between the prices of rawmaterial and agricultural products, and those of manufacturedgoods.  This maladjustment of prices was stated to be a seriousfactor in the economy of India and to meet It there is atendency for the producer and manufacturer or consumer to bebrought into closer relationship through the middleman, tending to act for both the buyer of the raw produce and the seller ofthe finished goods.  The middleman is thus not eliminated, but his services are obtained at cost price.  The process has gone                                                        /so
so far that the manufacturers or merchants actually financea large proportion of the crop, and, still further,organisations such as that of the Margarine manufacturers and the Co-operative Wholesale Sooiety, make their purchases,own their produce estates and effect their purchases on the spot.  On the other hand, too, it is becoming more usual forLancashire firms to sell their goods directly in the Indianbazaars.  These new tendencies contribute a welcome element of stability Into the economics of production.     In contradistinction to the unfavourable reports from thespecial industries, the Co-operative Movement continues toreport progress in turnover even though commodity prices are lower;  moreover, the increased opportunity for thriftpresented by these lower prices is reflected in the Co-operativedeposits.     In the money market there has been a downward tendency in money rates which wa3 signalised by the reduction of theBank Rate to 4$ on March 6th.  (It has since been reduced to3&quot;!^).  New capital issues during the month of February, though with a yield of over 5%, were largely left on the Underwriters 1hands.     A report from the new High Commissioner for New Zealandadds a bright spot to the picture since it shows that theeconomic position of the Dominion is sound, the low prices forwool and dairy produce being at least partly balanced by increased production.

                          CONFIDENTIAL.           Minutes of the Ninety-ninth meeting of the            Board of Trade &quot;Advisory^ Council held on                  Wednesday^ 12th March,  1950t     PRESIDENT OE THE BOARD OP TRADE:   I  want to apologise to theCouncil in this respect, that owing not  to a Cabinet Meeting thismorning but to it being necessary for me  to go to Geneva I shallhave to ask you to allow me to leave you  at a quarter to elevenand my place will then be taken by my colleague, Mr, Smith, theParliamentary Secretary,   Today we should like to give a welcome to Mr. Barron of the Building Trade, Mr,  Varley of theCo-operative Movement, Sir Ernest Glover of the shipping industry, Mr. Cairns of the Co-operative  Movement, and Mr.Titterington of the Textile Industryc    I give a very cordialwelcome to all those new members and I am sure that they will find the work of the Advisory Council of very great interest tothem,   I will now call upon the members in turn, taking firstSir Kenneth Stewart, tt                             COTTON,     SIR KENNETH STEWART:  I hope that the account  I give will bethe worst, because in the cotton trade we are steadily gettingmore and more depressed.   The unemployment figures have gone upto quite an unprecedented height, and this state of depressionin the cotton trade is not by any moans confined to this country,,Prom all the reports we get,, from Japan,, from Italy, fromCzecho-Slovakia, we get the same tale of intense depression, andthere is only one feature about it that gives one any particularhope, and it Is this:&quot;  there is no doubt that production isfalling off enormously everywhere, and that carries with it tosome extent the germ of its own recovery,, because when theseintense depressions occur nothing happens to help until stocksfall far below the minimum requisite for supplying  the export market.   Thus one has to wait for seme little time., but when the fresh buying does commence it usually commences in  considerablevolume, that is, if we are going to have previous historyrepeated.    In every single market and in every direction you getthis total lack of orders and total lack of confidence in every respect,                           CHEMICALS,,     MR, HILL:  Business  in the chemical market during the lastmonth has been by no means encouraging, and the close of themonth brought a particularly disappointing and unpromising tone.During the earlier part of the month heavy chemicals were active,but this was  followed by  a steady  falling off, and  the market isnow distinctly dull.   This inactivity in heavy chemicals is partly due to the severe  slump in  the artificial  silk business,as a  result  of which the  demand for chemicals consumed by that industry showed a sharp decline during recent weeks.   On theother hand,  fertilisers continued  to attract  increased attention,and it is gratifying to note that  there is a uniformly increasing
demand from abroad, especially as this increase is fairlyevenly spread ove? the whole of the fozneign business,   Thereis little change to report in the coal tar distilling industry.Business shows a weakening in the demand, especially on theforeign side, for creosote and pitch.   The chemical industryis interested in the practical step3 which have been taken todeal with the shipping of chemicals.   The Committee set up to investigate that subject has been -received with very great satisfaction,                           EMPLOYMENT ,     MR, HILTON;  In regard to the state of unemployment thenormal experience at this time of the year is that there is asubstantial improvement, but during the present year thatimprovement has not taken place.   At the 24th February thetotal figure on the register was 47,000 greater than on tho27th January, being an increase of that figure in a month,   Theaverage number of unemployed persons on the register during february was 1,523,000,   During the month the number whollyunemployed increased by 7,800 and the temporarily stopped by34,000 and casuals by 5,500, so that the great increase duringthe month has been in persons temporarily stopped in theiremploymente   If one looks at the figures for the variousdivisions at the end of January and the end of February onesees that there was no nett change in London;  in the SouthEast and South Y/est divisions there was a total nett increaseof 3,304, so that the South which comprises roughly all bolowa line from Bristol to the Humber has not suffered more than aslight decline^   In all these areas the figures rose slightlyat the beginning of the month but showed an improvement at theend of the month,.   In the other Divisions there were increases,but they were slight except in the North Western Division,.That includes Lancashire of course, where the increase amountedto 30,000 in the month.   This of course was due tc the declinein the cotton textile industrye   There was very little changeduring the month in coal mining, the heavy increase was in thecotton industry, and in the cotton industry the percentage rateof unemployment rose from 20 to 24%&apos;,    In silk and artificial silk it rose from 20 to 22^,   There was also some increase inthe woollen and worsted and bleaching and dyeing and finishingindustry, a.lso in general and electrical engineering, the motor vehicle industry and shipbuilding and ship repairing.There was a slight improvement in the  steel industry and alsoin the building trade, and in public works contracting.   Inthe distributive trades as in the dock  and harbour service thenumbers unemployed show an increase.   The -total number ofinsured persons employed at February 24th was about 57,000 lessthan at 27th January, and 17,000 less than at 25th February,1929,*     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE:  There is of course quite a definite movement of industry into the South,-&quot;- S3e Appendix p,6S.%^
MR0 HILTON:  Yes, that we have traced for some  years past.     SIR GUY GRANET:   Generally speaking the tendency of moneyrates has continued to be in a downward direction in sympathy with conditions prevailing at most of the foreign centres.This movement culminated in a reduction of the Bank of Englandrate from 4^% to 4% on March 6thn   The Reichsbank and otherContinental Central Banks immediately called a meeting of the governors and lowered their rate by    and it is confidentlyexpected that the governors of the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York will similarly lower its rate at their meeting thiuweek    This evidence of co-operation between the leadingcentral banks in a policy of cheaper money is distinctlyencouraging, as it will tend to counteract the effect of world-wide deflation of commodity prices and depression in economic conditions,,    The keen demand for bills has continuedunabated - there are very few of them about - with the resultthat the market rate, notwithstanding the recent reduction inthe official rate, is nearly 1% below the latter ratec     The Bank of england stock of gold Is practically thesame as a month ago and as the state of the foreign exchangeis generally in favour of this country, the immediate outlook for cur gold position is favourable,,   Berlin has recentlybeen the principal purchaser of the gold offered in the open market but tho Mark exchange has, during the past few days,moved well above the shipping point.   New issues of capitalon behalf of the Shell Transport Company, South african government, Hull Corporation and the Government of Nigeria,amounting to a total of about 15 million pounds met with apoor response on the part of the public, and the underwritershad to take up about  12 millions of the above loans, althoughthe yield in every case was over 5%*   An issue of  2 millionsMetropolitan Railway Debenture Stock, yielding about 5-f^ was over subscribed, as was also an issue of  750,000 HastingsCorporation Stock, yielding slightly over 5%&quot;.   In view of thetendency for money to cheapen the market for Gilt EdgedSecurities has been fairly active and strong.   On the other handbusiness in the industrial stock market has been poor in sympathy with the present state of industry.     MR. HOSE:  As regards business in South America,  theArgentine has a very bad crop cf cereals this year.    Thequantity that they produced is not so bad, but the monetary/ value  at  today&apos;s prices produced  40 millions loss than they got  last year,  and  the  result among other things is that the  exchange  has  depreciated by  11%,,   With regard to Brazil there  is  nothing  cheering unless it be what is almost only a rumour at  present that  some means are  being  devised for a big loan in  relief of coffee.   Quite how that will be done at present one  almost fails  to see because  the stock of coffee is, I would  almost say,  so  stupendous -  I do not think that is an-&quot;- Cf, Lord Bradbury&apos;s written statement  in the  Appendix,  p,5^.MONEY MARKET.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.3o
exaggeration - that people will be very shy of lending theamount required for the purpose, even if they can get it,   Ido not think it would be any good lending less than  20 millionSterling, and nobody would have the courage to tackle it at thepresent moment.   In Chile there is a considerable change comingabout on the 1st July in connection with nitrate of soda, theprincipal commodity of Chile,   The gross result, if one mayexpress it in rather unkind terms is, that the little ones willbe squeezed out and the big ones will become a little bigger,and those big ones, consisting generally of about four firms,one of which is an American firm and another equally important one is Czecho-Slovakian, with a little mixture in It and anothercombination Is English, and the fourth German.   It may interestsome of the officials of your Department to watch what has beendone and what has been announced to be done in this regard.If any one of them would like to get information I should bepleased to get one of my people to give them anything they asked for.   It Is especially interesting at the present moment in view, of the old story of the synthetic,   I am handing inthe usual memorandum.t     SIR D, MILNE WATSON:  There Is a large reduction in gasoutput In the current year, but that is due to the very muchmilder weather we have been having this year over last year,but part of It is no doubt the depression of trade generally in the country,   With regard to the by-products market, pitchis a fairly steady market but the contracting season is nowpractically over, so that we do not expect any alteration inthat market for some time to come.   With regard to creosotethe demand is very poor at the present moment, and tnat productis rather a drug on the market at the moment,   America hasstrictly rationed the quantity to be sent into that country which is affecting this trade very seriously.   With regard to road tar, there Is an increasing demand for road tar thisseason, whioh is very gratifying especially as I trace a little of this to a circular issued by the Ministry of Hoalthadvising local authorities where possiblo to use British madematerial,   I attribute the effect of that to that circular.With regard to sulphate of ammonia, the position is veryserious from the point of view of the makers of by-products as distinct from synthetic,   Tho price today is only  6,15,0. asagainst the price of  12 pre-war, and I certainly neverremember such a low price.   This of course is largely due tothe enormous increase in synthetic sulphate of ammonia which isbeing manufactured in most countries now and one sees no chanceof any Improvement in this market whatsoever.   The result isthat instead of sulphate of ammonia being an asset of revenueGAS INDUSTRYa1* See Appendix p,%S,
C ONFrogjjT JJ-L.account it is a debit, it actually costs money to dispose  ofthe ammonia, a very serious matter for gas companies,  and  olsofor coke oven firms.   Notwithstanding this very low pricethe demand is not so good as one had hoped to see. &apos; This  isdue to world-wide depression agriculturally, and in the east to the fall in the value of silver which has affected  theforeign exchanges,   China especially was a very promisingmarket and though we are selling sulphate in China the fall inthe exchange adversely affected the sale.   It is not  a veryrosy picture I am afraid with regard to the by-prod\ictmarket at the present moment,                            SHIPPING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:  With regard to shipping.     Things I think are v/orse today than they have ever been.Speaking of oversea trade for cargo ships I doubt whether  inany part of the world today a freight could be obtained whichwould cover the cost of the voyage.   That is the general position.   Taking the figures, the index number of freightsfor February is 19% below the average of 1913, whilst  ofcourse the costs are something like 60 to 70% above the 1913figures.   This has shown its of feet in the number of shipslaid up.   The record for ships laid up in British ports on the1st January was 352,000 nett tons mostly British, being equalto about 320,000 dead weight lifting capacity, whilst  up tothe 10th march British and Foreign steamers had been laid  upto the extent of about 336 of a dead weight capacity of2,073,000 tons in Great Britain and Continental ports,,  Thatcomprises the list of steamers whose names have been sent  into the particular paper which was collecting the information,but I do not think it comprises anything like the total, andI should think we have today something like 23g million tonsdead weight capacity of shipping laid up in Europe,   This ofcourse is exclusive of the American tonnage, some of v/hich ismore or less permanently laid up, but some of which has been laid up because of lack of business and it is understood from american reports that something like 2 million gross tons  of american shipping are laid up,   I have no special informationtoday about the coasting trade.   As far as the liner business is concerned I do not think there is any change.   There iscertainly no improvement,   Strango to say the coal export as reported was better during December1 and January than it was forprevious months.   It was on the basis in December of 60 million tons per annum and January 65 million tons, but I am afraidfrom what one has seen of the market in the report of february and February-iiarch,! it will be very much worse for thesemonths.   There is so little business doing in export  trade,I have here some figures regarding shipbuilding and so on,a number of figures which I do not think I need trouble youwith by reading them at present, but perhaps I can put them insimply as a record of the state of shipbuilding and forStatistical purposes,2^Exports of coal from U.K.  during February wore  4,735,000 tonsor at the rato of 57,000,000 tons per annum and  February is,of course, a short month,2See Appendix p,40.r*5-
See Appendix p.&amp;*.See Appendix p.46 .                            HOSIERY.       MR. WALKER.   With regard to the  hosiery trade, I am  afraid that the reports from all the centres show that  the trade continues in a very depressed condition and the/ outlook for the immediate future is most unpromising.  Nottingham reports that unemployment and under-employment  are greater than for a very considerable time.   Various  causes have contributed to the present state of acute  depression, amongst which may be mentioned the mild winter  which has restricted the sale of winter underwear; (very  little business having been transacted in this section  since Christmas), and the falling prices of raw materials,  principally those relating to wool.       Another contributory factor is the uncertainty  respecting the fate of the duties on Silk and Artificial  Silk.   Since the imposition of the duties in 1925, the Silk  and Artificial Silk branches of the trade have been both  progressive and prosperous, and the uncertainty now previous &amp;il-  ing is most deplorable, as at this time of the year,  manufacturers should be working to production in order to  produce for the season&apos;s trade.       It is also worthy of note that Cotton Stockings  and Socks Imported into and retained in this country amounted  in tho year 1913 to 663,243 dozen pairs, valued at  237,917,  and that during the year 1929 the figures increased to  3,913,505 dozen pairs of the value of  1,796,934.  2,190,715  dozens of foreign made Cotton Knitted Underwear of the value  of  1,168,575 were also sold in this country last year.       The reports from other districts, Mansfield, Hinckley  and Leicester are very similar.   In Hinckley especially,  which Is chiefly silk and artificial silk, they are  feeling the depression very acutely.   I have a report from  Hawick, in Scotland)  there, they say, since the beginning  of the year the trade both in the Underwear and Outerwear  Sections has been worse than at any period since the War,..  I will put in these full reports.1   Generally the position  in the hosiery trade is worse than for a very long time.                        COLONIAL TRADE.       MR. VERNON:  I vd.ll put In some figures showing  comparative imports into the principal East and West African  colonies from the United Kingdom and other parts of the  British Empire and foreign countries.    I was asked about  this last time and I thought these figures would be of  interest.   Speaking generally, the percentage from the  United Kingdom is very much higher to West Africa than to  East Africa.   From the United Kingdom alone it is as high
in Nigeria as 70 per cent, whereas the corresponding figure for the Tanganyika territory is only 34 per cent.The total Imports from the British Empire into Tanganyikaterritory are 54 per cent, of the totalj  in Kenya and uganda, 62 per cent.   In the Gold Ooast the proportion is58 per cent, and In Nigeria it is as high as 74 p^r cent.There Is a decrease during the months of last year for whichstatistics are available In the proportion from the UnitedKingdom whioh I am told is mainly due to a reduction of theimport of gin.   The general figures in Kenya and Uganda for1929 are good.   The value of domestic exports was  7 million as compared with  6,600,000 in the previous year.   Therewas a record export of cotton from Uganda amounting to816,000 centals, which compared with 550,000 in the previous year,   There was also a considerable Increase in theimports for home consumption into Kenya and Uganda.   Thepercentage from the United Kingdom was about the same, ashade less than compared with the previous year.   In Tanganyika territory there was a slight decrease in domesticexports,  3,722,000 as compared with  3,873,000.   There wasa very slight increase in cotton.   The other principalexports were sisal, coffee, hides and skins, and, to acertain extent, ground nuts..   The total value of imports into Tanganyika territory during 1929 was  4,285,000 ascompared with  3,737,000 In 1928, a fairly substantial increase.   The percentage from the United Kingdom was ra&apos;therlower, 34 per cent, as compared with 36 per cent.   In theGold Coast, taking the first 11 months of 1929, the exporttrade was  11,049,000 as compared with the  11,619,000during the corresponding period of the previous year.   Thedecline is, mainly, I think, in the price of cocoa.   Theimport trade of the G-old Coast during the first 11 monthsof 1929 was very substantially less than in the previous year,  8,399,000 as compared with  10,508,000.   That is partly due to a reduction in the imports of spirits andpartly due to the low price of cocoa making the purchasingcapacity of the Gold Coast less.     The figures for Cyprus though of minor importance are ofinterest as constituting a record for the Island.   The total value of exports of merchandise in 1929 was  1,635,736. ascompared with  1,435,767 in 1928 - an inorease of nearly14 per cent.   The value of exports to the United Kingdomincreased from  283,315 to  306,855, but the percentage to total exports fell from 19.73 per cent, to 18., 76 per cent.     The total value of imports of merchandise during1929 was  1,983,833, as compared with  1,840,442 in 1928 -an increase  of 7,79 per cent.   The value of imports fromthe United Kingdom and other parts of the British Empireincreased from  810,806 to  865.882;  but the percentage to total imports fell slightly from 44.06 per cent, to 43.65per cent.     The only other figures which I think are worthgiving are the exports of domestic rubber from BritishMalaya, that is to say not including imports from the dutch east Indies.    During January the figure was 43,000tons.    The total export including the Dutch East Indies
is 52,000 tons in January,   That is, rather surprisingly,I think, a slightly higher figure than the average of theprevious year, which we thought was going to be a recordfigure.   The output of tin and tin ore from the federated malay States shows a slight increase for January, 6,128tons as compared with 5,856 tcn3 in January 1929.     PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE,   I must leave now,and will ask Mr, Walter Smith to take the Chair,     ^Fhe President left and Mr. Walter Smith took        the Chair/&apos;.                          BUILD ING.     MR. BARRON.   I am sorry that being a new member I am not prepared with any statement except to say this that themost impressive thing to us in the building industry is theamount of unemployment and In spite of the fact that agentleman on the other side of the table quoted a slightimprovement there Is something like 150,000 unemployed workersin the building industry.   That, of course, as you canunderstand is the most serious item in the building industry for us as, and I suppose this applies in most otherindustries, the number of unemployed does not bear relationts the amount of productive work carried on.   The developmentof new methods in the building industry, while I have nofigures to prove it, show that the amount of work produced in the industry is produced, shall I say, by about two-thirds of the number of men that would have been employedpre-war on that particular work, and that, of course, make sit very difficult to visualise a time, even when the buildingindustry is booming, when all the men normally engaged in itwill find employment.   The biggest drop, of course, is in house production.   Owing to the uncertainty in the politicalworld and waiting on new legislation^ Local Authorities have very largely held their hands and there has been a veryconsiderable drop during the past year in housebuilding,     MR, WALTER SMITH:  Is the unemployment in the building trade general, or are some districts v/orse than others?     MR. BARRONs  It pretty well follows the state of the primary industry in the district.   Take South Wales, that ispractically the worst district, and the same would apply tothe Northern Counties, Durham and Northumberland, and someother districtSs   The best districts are the Eastern Countiesthe Southern Counties and London,                       SHIPBUILDING.     MR, BARRON:  In regard to shipbuilding, in spite of thevery depressing statement in regard to shipping, I am glad tosay that shipbuilding is and has improved considerably and isemploying more men.   But there again, the same fact will haveto be taken into consideration, possibly even more acutelythan in the building industry, that the amount of work is
completed by a very much lese number of men than in pre-wardays, owing again to new methods of construction, thedevelopment of pneumatic tools, and so on,                       AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. SANDERSON:  Australia during the last month hashad very good rains in the North and the prospect from theagricultural point of view is good there.   The southernportion of the continent has not yet shared.in these good rainsbut it is not too late for them to do so.   There has beenreceived into store between 1st July and 31at January 2,300,000bales of wool, of which 1,200,000 have been sold.   The recentimproved prices have been maintained.     The exports of wheat this season are 16 million bushelsas compared with 38 million bushels last year.   A Conferenceof Australian wheatgi*owers last month recommended theformation of a Commonwealth Compulsory Wheat Pool to controlinterstate and export trade, also State Pools for intra Statetrade subject to ballot of wheatgrowers In States favouringsuch action.   The Victorian Cabinet approves of this suggestion.,The Prime Minister urges wheatgrowers to increase production.     Exports of flour this season are 107,000 tons comparedwith 136,000 last season.     The Commonwealth Government has decided to Increase thebounty on export wino from l/- to l/6d, per gallon.     Of canned fruit the total exports for the 1929 Seasonwere 1,026,600 dozen tins compared ?;ith 1,074,300 dozen inthe previous  season.     In the matter of finance, the Loan Council has decidedto reduce Loan expenditure to half last year&apos;s and toendeavour to finance future loans mainly from the Australianmarket.   The Commonwealth 6 per cent. Conversion Loan waswell received.   I have a rather later cable advice to saythat the Conversion Loan of  10,400,000 due on 15th Marchhas been over-subscribed by  3 millions, the total subscriptionrepresenting  7^ idllions in cash and  6% millions conversion.The exchange position remains difficult and it Is not quite clear at the moment how the difficulties will be overcome.   Itis quite conceivable that the position may be even a littlemore strained than it is now before things are straightened.     The total imports Into the Commonwealth during the sixmonths ended December 19 29 were  75 million as compared with 73 million for the same period of 1928.   The exports were 49 millions as compared with  67 millions;  in addition
bullion and specie  9,683,000 compared with  1,887,000.     The Customs Revenue for the eight months ended InFebruary last was  29-g- millions, which is an increase of if millions as compared with the previous year,   I daregay members may have noticed some newspaper references to a-further increase In the tariff,   I have no official information of that.   I suggest that even If it is so,possibly it has occurred from a desire to get further cashand not from any other motive.     The postal revenue for the eight months ended february was  8,983,000 an Increase of  573,000 compared with theprevious year  February  1,032,000 an increase of  7,000compared with February, 19 29.     One important thing from the shipping point of view isthat the Commonwealth Government proposes to amend theIndustries&apos; Preservation Act, for the purpose of legalisingcontracts approved by the Australian Overseas TransportAssociation for the carriage of wool, meat, butter and fruitshipped to Britain and Europe.   Negotiations have been going on for some time past in order &apos;io make those contractslegal and in order to do that an amendment has to be madeto the existing legislation.   That is being done.     There has been an interesting development which may or may not lead to sane thing important in regard to oil.   TheCommonwealth Government has decided to give financialassistance to such work and not to subsidise deep drillingin areas which have not been properly and adequatelysurveyed.   The subsidies will be based on  1 to be givenby the Government for every  3 expended by the Company.Dr. Woolnough is paying a special visit to the principaloilfields of America in order to obtain information there.     There is one other item which, might interest Mr.Walker,a Report that the Holeproof Hosiery Company of America hasamalgamated with the Australian Company for the manufactureof hosiery in Australia.     MR. E.  WALKER.    I had heard of that.   I think Kayser&apos;stoo have amalgamated.     MR, TITTERINGTON.    I would like to ask the previousspeaker if there is any arrangement between the australian government and the pastoralists, the wool growers, withregard to financing them for the maintenance of theirgrades of wool,     MR. SANDERSON.    Kot at all, so far as I am aware.Many negotiations have been attempted and many suggestions have been made, but so far In that respect the graziers asa body have taken up the attitude that they would ratherget out of their own difficulties.
                       INDIAN TRADE.     MR. LINDSAY: Mr. Chairman, it is a year since i attended a meeting of the -advisory Council and I have spent eight months of the past year in India,   I thinksome account of recent developments out there might be ofinterest to the Council-   One of the big handicaps totrade in India in the past, since the war, has been the gap that exists between the prices of raw meterials andthe prices of manufactured goods.   If you taxe, on theone hand, the average class of raw material which theIndian cultivator produces and the stock manufactures whichhe buys, you will find that there is a disproportionbetween the two, a mal-^. djustment.   You will find, forinstance, that in spite of the decline in the quantity ofcotton piece goods that the Indian has been buying since thewar, he is spending about the same amount of rupees onhis purchases, the same aggre ate.   The gap between theprices of, shall we say, wheat and rice and pulse and otherstaple agricultural products, on the one hand, and, on theother hand, cotton piece goods, galvanised iron, matches,and. other stable manufactures that he imports was at itsworst in 1923 when agricultural prices were very little over-pre-war level and manufacture prices were two and sometimestwo and a half times the pre-war level.   That gapcontracted last year very considerably; in fact, it contractedin 1928 and remained fairly narrow in 1929, but there is evidence of an expansion again with the slump which hasoccurred in the price of raw materials.   It stands toreason that that gap must be bridged in some way.  You mustarrive at some sort of tendency which will Increase the price that is paid to the producer and, if you are   oing to do that and that only, you are going to increase the cost of themanufactured articles, because the manufacturer^ rawmaterials are going to become more expensive.  Therefore,if the thing is to be done thoroughly you must find theprice going up for the producer and down for the manufacturer or the consumer, and the tendency that I foundin India was a tendency which seemed to me to point towardsthat conclusion.   There Is an increasing tendency, I won:tsay to cut out the middleman because the middleman isan  essential part of the system, but to treat the middlemanso to 3peak as an agent, either of  the producer, on theone hand, or of the consumer and manufacturer, on the o^herhand.   You will find,  for example, that the Japanese will use the same agency for buying raw  cotton in India andfor selling their cotton manufactures.   Instead of sittingat the port, as  they used to do in  the old days, and waiting for the Indian dealer to bring than the raw  cotton,they have their  own agents right up on the field andthey are now advancing  from that to the stage at which theyactually  finance a very large portion of the  crop.   Thereyou see a process under which transfers of ownership arevery much reduced.   Cotton is bought direct from the producer and there is no change of  ownership until itactually reaches  one spinner in Japan,   Then you, get
the reverse thing happening; cotton piece goods manufactured in Japan are brought back and sold through  the same agency;perhaps brought back to the same field.   Now, Sis, I feelthat that tendency seems to have come  to stay as long asthe gap must be bridged between the producer and theconsumer, that is to say, that there must be a closerrelationship between the two.   You find, not only that themiddleman is reaching further back towards  the producer andfarther forward towards the consumer,  but you find alsothe case In which the manufacturer or  the merchant inthis country is reaching further back  also  towards the producer.   You will find the Co-operative  Wholesale Societywith Its own tea estates in India and  with  its ownpurchasing organisation in India.   Instead of waiting forthe tea to be sold to it, it has effected its own purchasingoperations in India.   The number of cases  might be increasedindefinitely.   The margarine manufacturers&apos; organisationpurchases oil seeds and vegetable oils in the country ofproduction.   Dunlops do the same in the case of rubber.It seems to me that that is a very important development,from two points of view.   First of all, as a development which goes far towards bridging this gap which I have described, but there is a further subsidiary development which is also important, namely, that  you are arriving atan actual economic solution of the agricultural creditsdifficulty; that the eld system of co-operative creditsocieties, which has done such extraordinarily good workin India, is being supplemented by a system under which themerchant or manufacturer is providing  capital for the crop.There is a further development which I -think is of equal oreven of greater importance and that is that you are arriving at a system under which the crop is bought  as a crop, notpiecemeal and that means there is greater stability inthe prices paid.   Long term contracts are  made and crops are bought, sometimes even before the  crop  is harvested,at what appears at the time to be an economic rate.   Thathas undoubtedly, a steadying effect on the  market.Consumers&apos; co-operative societies have not  developed inIndia yet, but I think there are indications that they will develop and that would probably help on  the same tendency,that is, towards stability of pxices.     With regard to cotton piece goods,  here alsothere&apos; are some indications of the. same tendency.   Youwill find sales effected by Lancashire,  not to the oldhouses who have carried that trade for so long in  India, butthe tenderscy Is, to some extent, to go past them direct to  the bazaar and to effect their sales  in  the bazaar.That is part of the same principle &amp;f, I will not saycutting out the middleman because you  cannot  cut him out,but of securing the middleman&apos;s  services at cost price andavoiding transfers  of ownership  of the goods  on the way.As  far as  I  can see,  the danger  from this  system in india is  a falling off in the quality  of arbitrations.  Arbitrationsin the old days were  carried on very largely by reliablemembers  of the big European  firms isi India  and if  thebusiness  is  going past  tho? e firms to  firms who cannot afford to maintain  the same  class  of assistant, arbitration issuffering  in consequence.
WOOL.       Mi.  TITTERINGTON:   The observations I want to  make this morning are relative to the wool textile trade.  The  usual indicators  or pointers. I am afraid,  Sir, confirm  the  state of depression and facing that fact the economic  effect of our Industry, the wool textile industry, as a  whole, looks likely to be a shrinking factor.    The points&apos;  of contact we have with the trade regarding unemployment  figures show an increase in unemployment.   The statistical  information regarding machine  activity shows that more  machines  are now being put out of commission.    The wool  and  various fabrics which pass through our testing house  made from raw wool yarns or various fibres show that the  volume of these goods has decreased,  which is  a reflex  of the trade and shows  the extent to which the work is not  being done.   Those three pointers graphically indicate  that the wool textile trade is shrinking.  The confirmation  of these observations will be  found in the prices prevailing  for  raw wool, which have been  steadily declining, the  prices for the various  types of yarns and for the top, all  of which, of course,  are the raw materials for the  subsequent processes  that follow, resulting eventually  in the fabric Itself.   Therefore, the whole aspect of*  the  trade is one which confirms a steady decline.   To the  lay  mind it may seem that falling prices were  indicative  of opportunities for the trade to revive, but,  in  contradistinction of that point of view, falling prices do  not  seem to encourage a revival in industry.   As you know,  Sir, we are faced with competition abroad.   Our exports  generally are down and continue progressively  to decline.  The  outstanding feature of the trade during the last month  has  been the report of the. enquiry by Lord LfecMillan.  I am sure the details of it are before the Department  because the paper has been laid on the Table of the House.  I do not propose to enter into any controversial matter at  this stage as to whether that  report offers any solution  of the economic difficulties with which we are faced.  The  suggestion of decreasing the price and the comments  regarding reorganisation in the trade - as to  whether those  offer a solution which will revive the industry, at the  moment I am not permitted to sajr.   I may add that the whole  of the report has been and is  at this moment under  consideration by the parties,  the operatives on the one hand  and the employers1 associations on the other hand, as to  whether the recommendations put forward by His Lordship  are  to he looked upon with favour, with a view to  rehabilitating our Industry.       There is this one observation which I have been  encouraged by previous speakers, as this is my first  meeting,  to make, an observation which you, Sir, might  bring before your Department,  on the question of research  work.   I notice an observation has been made by the Wool  Research Association that the enquiries which they have  been making regarding the utilisation of wool and ancillary  fibres have not come quickly to the notice of those who  are engaged in the industry, dut;  to the reluctance of the
C ON FIDEKT IAL .particular parties in that Association.   The  exact statement is this; that research work which has been undertaken bythat body is not allowed to go to the industry untilthe whole of the parties concerned jointly say the time isopportune.   We are face to face with a similar movement.I happen to be the Chairman of our own Technical College inBradford and the research work which we have undertakenunder that body, regarding the economic use of wooltextile fibres, was the subject matter of a little round-table conference some few weeks ago with severalindustrialists in the trade and, contrary to tho prejudiceyou have, as a Government Department, we, on our side, much prefer the trade, as a whole, to get right down to the joband do all possible to extract the fullest advantage fromany research work that might have been done and to put it immediately into operation to revive our industry.  without going Into too much technical detail, we are faced witha change over from the utilisation of the previouslyaccepted fibres and we have to adapt ourselves to the newtrade.   If the world demand is not going to be for pure woolfibres, and we have got to face the fact that the worlddemands fabrics which are modified by the introductionof cotton fibres, or rayon elements, and so on, wemust adapt ourselves to the world demand and the worldrequirements.   That being so, I think we can reasonably expect the fullest reports from all the parties concerned.     As far as the wool textile demand is concerned, thereis undoubtedly not a good demand for the heavier woollens,the better types of worsteds.   There is a slightly improveddemand in the lighter dress fabrics for women1s wear, butagain that Is the Industrial side In which there has beenthe keenest competition and the keenest activity and all the subsequent processes of manufacture, In the form of dyeingand finishing, show a depressed condition.   The. number of hours being worked in the dyeing and. finishing establishm^ntsof the trade averages in our area at the moment twenty-fiveto thirty hours a week at a maximum.   The fabrics whichare coming through are coming through in such small quantities, two or three to the shade, that the bulk tradewith which the wool textile trade was formerly familiar, isnow getting down to very v-ory small quantities.  That has some very violent repercussions in the sense that it. cannotbe processed economically, as has hitherto been done, and,therefore, the further we get into a depressed state,relatively increased become our production costs.     MR.. WALTER SMITH:  A note will be. taken of yoursuggestion with regard to research work.     MR. SANDERSON:  May I say, in regard to the research question, I have a note here that Dr. Riyett ofthe Council of Scientific and Industrial Research &apos;is proceeding to England immediately to confer with scientificbodies here regarding the application of science to primary -Australian industries.   That is particularly in view ofthe wool situation at the present time.
    GO NF IDEM! IAL.CO-OP SI AT ITS TRADE.     MR. VARLEY.  Mr. Chairman, as representing  theCo-operative Movement, my story is not quite so  dull anddreary as some of the things that have been said this morning.I represent the English Co-operative Jfovement.   Our trade,despite the fall of commodity prices, has  increased inmonetary value during the month compared with what it wastwelve months ago.  So far as the different commodities areconcerned, during the middle of the month  a quiet demand from the Continent resulted in a reduction of 12/6&amp; per cwt,in the price of butter;  that is Danish butter.  There isexpected to be a further reduction during  the month ofApril.  There Is also an increase in the exports of butterfrom the countries surrounding the Baltic  Sea, with theexception of Russia.  They seem to be pushing the dairyindustry and are steadily increasing the butter  exports.New Zealand5 and Australia are also sending supplies of comparatively good value and quality all that can be desired.The market in butter during the month closed with easyprices and they were of a tempting character.     So far as cheese is concerned, New Zealand  is sendingus some very good stuff.  Present quotations have offeredinducements to buyers to operate with more confidence.Supplies of Cheshire and Lancashire have continued quietwith an easier tendency.     Sugar at the moment is offering rather a difficulty.At the close of the month, all-white sugars (with a few exceptions) were reduced.  Uncertainty as  to budgetintentions has caused the refiners to deplete their stocksheld at inland depots.   The larger refiners have a methodof sending out their goods without orders to quite anumber, forty or fifty maybe, of the larger towns andcities. The goods lie there and are issued to the orderof the customer.  Of course, the order goes to the headquarters and the customer gets his note to receive thesupply and carts it from the station or the depot v/herait is stored.  At the moment, owing to the budgetuncertainties, the stocks of those depots have been reducedconsiderably;  in fact, they are trying to clear them outaltogether, so that if there is any consequent loss  it willnot fall on the refiner.  He is trying to get it within his own immediate control.  At the moment there  is rather a difficulty in receiving the supplies of sugar that may berequired.     Wheat, during the month, so far as Liverpool, Chicagoand Winnipeg are concerned, has also shown Improvedquotations.  Argentina has advanced by from 6d to 9d per quarter.  There is an impression abroad that the visit of the Canadian Wheat Pool Directors has lessened theconfidence of the Pool&apos;s power to control the world&apos;swheat supplies and prices.  Good supplies of australian wheat are afloat at reasonable prices.  Some of thePools are talking of putting thel  wheat into store  until an Improved tone In the marked makes its appearance  asregards home grown wheat - the agitation for a stabilisedprice seems to be increasing and the country may have to
face the question of whether it is worth while to continuegrowing wheat in the United Kingdom In face of theworld&apos;s over-production.  The flour market remains easyfollowing the severe decline in values of North Americanwheat.     As far as bacon and hams are concerned, there Is a disposition for all Continental meats to rule firm todearer.  That la one of the exceptions to the generalslump In commodity prices.  South of Ireland long meatsand North of Ireland rolled still have the appearance oflabouring under difficulties as regards high cost and supplies;  consequently unchanged to dearer quotationshave been recorded.     So far as tea is concerned, there has been verylittle change on the market during the month.  In theearly day3 of the month there was certainly a slightlystronger tendency for all descriptions, but later themarket became generally steady again for all gradesexcept&apos;medium and poorest descriptions which were rathereasier.  Towards the end of the month the market showed a stronger tone, and everything could be quoted firm,with a hardening tendency.  The poor, medium, and plainliquoring kinds were in too large supply and moved withsome irregularity, whilst good liquoring teas becamescarce and realised higher prices.  Indian teas have beenin good demand with slight irregularity in prices,although no essential change occurred in any givendirection;   only commonest proved a weak feature.  Ceylonauctions elisited the most active competition at fullprices, but any higher prioes realised were due to improvedquality.  Only very low grades failed to command increasedattention.  Java and Sumatra sales met with good competitionat firm to dearer rates.  Chinas sold steadily at a full range of prices.     As to Coffee - in the early part of the month goodsupplies of . Costas (Atlantic side) were offered at auctionand met a slow demand, while prices showed an easiertendency, but fine descriptions brought fairly steady prices.Home trade kinas of fine liquoring qualities commanded fullprices.  British East Africans of fine liquoring kindsrealised very full prioes, but medium and common sorts-sold Irregularly.  Indian new crop ruled steady generally and realised prices which conformed with quality.  Towardsthe end of the month the market generally became muchquieter and prices showed much irregularity&quot;with a dull tone,closing for the most part, easier to weaker.    The cocoa market has been generally dull and quiet andthere has been only a retail movement with regard to the spot market, whilst general quietness,&apos;attended by weakness,characterised forward positions.  Accra has been of slowsale, there having been only a limited enquiry.  Trinidads(new crop) Bahias, San Thomes and Guayaquil at averageprices were also slow of sale, demand being limited.     Chocolate has been rather improving. Forward bookingshave been the chief feature In view of the approachingEaster trade.
     The cash value of the sales of the Co-operative wholesale Society, i.e.,  our exports to foreign countries for the four weeks ending 1st March show an increase,particularly in the case  of sales to Russia.     It may interest you  to know that the herrings over thisyear come to this side of the water instead of to Norway,as they went for two years, and they showed an increase during the last month of   27,000 - bought by us on behalfof the Prussian Co-operative organisations.     Generally speaking,  so far as our Movement is concernedwe are still on the increase, even though commodity prices are lower.   As representing the consumer, so far as prices are concerned it is to our interest to have lower prices andto distribute to our members at easier prices, as therebythey obtain a better type of living or the possibility forthrift and saving.   The  latter is rather showing itself inthe increases in our deposits and in our individual accountswhich are rather marked at the moment.   That is possiblybecause of the lower cost of living and the inducement to save against the possibility of being thrown out ofemployment at some time.    They seem to be looking forward to the possible rainy fay.     MR. BEN TURNER:  Th t drop of 12/6d to the actualconsumer, did it come to  taking that 1-jjrd a lb. off?     MR. VARLEY:  I * aak it would.     MR. GILLETT:  D.. \ you say that your organisation hadsold herrings to the  tussian Government?     MR. VARLEY:  V7b bought the herrings from the fisherand sold it to the Centro soyus which is the Co-operativeorganisation in  Russia,,   We sold them some 40,000 this winter.     MR. GILLETT:  Did you have to give them a credit?     MR. VARLEY:  Yes.     MR. GILLETT:  For some considerable period?     MR. VARLEY;  Nine months.     MR. BEN TURNER:  How have your cloth sales been?     MR. VARLEY:  This month they have not been good sofar as our exports are concerned, but so far as our normal trade is concerned fairly good.     MR. BEN TURNER:  As  regards your cloth mills?     MR. VARLEY:  They are all working full time.
 CONFIDENTIAL^RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     SIR RALPH wEDG/JOOD:  As a new member of the council I have not had time to collect any general information in reference to the Railway industry beyond the publishedweekly receipts which 1 think you all see and. which arein this document here*;&quot;-     The interpretation of the weekly returns is of courselargely conjectural, and 1 can do no more in that respectthan supplement them to some extent by figures relatingto my own railway, the London and North Eastern Railway,which may be taken as representing the Eastern side of thecountry and particularly the North East Coast.     As to the figures for the railways as a whole, thereceipts during the nine weeks ending 1st March are perhapsof a rather more cheerful character than one might have expected from the distressing story we have heard from various individual industries.   One must not infer too much from them, because there is no doubt that during thecorresponding period of 1929 traffics on the whole were bad.There was a prolonged frost which, apart from the stimulusit gave to the coal trade and perhaps also to underwear,did not do much to help the general merchandise traffic,and in fact agriculture was definitely held up.     The general position as regards merchandise, thatis of traffic excluding coal and  coke, was that in the nineweeks the railways snowed.an increase in receipts of 3.14 percent over last year.    The figures for the North East Coast,for the London and North Eastern  Railway, are perhaps ofinterest in that connection.   They show that whilst outtonnage - the figures  I have given so far as receipts - onthe London and North Eastern Railway in merchandise andminerals increased by  9.5 per cent, that was almost entirely in the lower classes,  (1 to 6) which include a  large partof the raw materials of the heavy industries and a  large part of the agricultural production.   Those show an increase over the  nine weeks of 18% in tonnage  in the  NorthEastern  area, whereas  the higher  classes of merchandise  are practically stationary with an  increase  of  .74  per  cent.It would seem that  the increase which we have had in themerchandise receipts during the nine weeks  is probably  to a large  extent accounted for by the unfavourable&quot;weather  oflast year.   Incidentally,  in those figures for the traffic in the lover classes a considerable increase has been experienced in  the  beet root, traffic In  connection  with thebeet  industry.      Coming next  to  coal  and coke, there has been a decrease on the whole which may be attributed,at  any rate In the first  instance, to  the milder weather.   Receipts for  the four Companies  show a  decrease  of 3.91 per  cent, the only exception being m the case of  the Great Western Railwaywhere  there is  a slight increase.   I am  unable  to, give  a precise  reason  for the increase.   There  the figures may be elucidated  a little by reference  to the  position on theNorth East  Coast where the  tonnage shows  an increase*See Appendix p. 36.
of 2.77 per cent on the London and North Eastern hallwayas compared with a decrease in receipts of 1.85 per cent.But that increase is entirely in the shipment traffic, which shows an increase of 1% over the corresponding figures oflast year, wu.ile other than shipment traffic, what we calllandsale traffic, is practically stationary with a decreaseof .1 per cent.   I infer from that - but it is a matterof conjecture - that the decrease is largely, as you would expect, in the land sale rather than in the export, and thatit is due very largely to the  milder weather.     I do not think I need supplement that except by reference possibly to passenger traffic, which only reflects the general state of trade in a very indirect way but wherethe situation is perhaps interesting.   In passenger trainreceipts we have an increase of 1.57 per cent, which,considering bad trade, is not unsatisfactory, but may againreflect the very hard weather last year which discouragedpassenger traffic.   The increases are most marked in theSouthern area, as one might expect, and I think we mayattribute that, without making too wild an inference, toelectrification and increase in suburban business.     When you come to numbers, I am only able to giveparticulars for the London and North Eastern Railway.   Therewe have the position that existed all through last year -an increase, as far as the London and North Eastern Railwayis concerned, in receipts of 1.&apos;.5 per cent but an increasein numbers carried of 8.5 per cent.   That was a featureall through last year, that the railways were carrying morepassengers and at that time earning less receipts.&quot;  It  isfair to say that in addition to oarryingmore passengers theydid run a very considerable additional mileage, and 1 should think it is also fair to infer that the increase of 162,000 in their passenger receipts during the first nineweeks of this year has all been spent in running increasedmileage.     Every additional train mile costs anything from 2/6d to4/6d out of pocket expenses.   The additional mileage whichwe have run this year has probably cost us more than theadditional receipts.   That does not mean it was a mistake.Had we not run that mileage our position might have beendefinite^ worse.   Capital expenditure hardly comes in  there.     MR. RIDLEY WAREAM:  The weekly output of coal in theUnited Kingdom for the three weeks ended February 22ndwas: -COAL.Week ended February 8thvVeek ended February 15thWeek ended February 22nd5,479,000 tons.5,609,000 tons.&apos;5,551,000 tons.
The average for the eight weeks ended February 22nd was,397,000 tons as compared with 5,143,000 for thecorresponding period of last year,  an increase of a quarter of a million tons per week.     The number of persons employed for the week endedFebruary 22nd was 958,500, equal to 86.3 per cent of the1913 figure.     Unemployment for the month of January was 12.9 per  centas compared with 14.6 per cent in December and 21.9 per  centaverage in 1928 - a very great improvement.     The quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom,excluding the Irish Free State, in January was 5,281,011 tons as compared with 4,804,117 tons in December and 4,271,185tons in January 1929.   The average price per ton.f.o.b. inJanuary was 17/- as compared with 16/6 in December.     As I remarked last month, owing to the very mildweather this winter the coal trade is now suffering from a somewhat serious re-action.   Coal is plentiful, new business is not coming forward readily, and prices havefallen still further.   In the overseas trade tenders havenow been sent in for large contracts for the State Railwaysof Sweden, Finland, and Belgium, and we are now awaitingvery anxiously the result of those tenders.   One Railwayin Finland has just bought a small quantity, one half ofthe cheaper Northumberland coal and one half of Polish coal.The Polish owners, who sometime  ago were asking a reasonably high figure for their coal, have now made largereductions in their price, and are competing strongly atlow prices with British coal.   Exports by sea from Polandin January show a very considerable increase over December,the figures being as follows:-                  December 1929 .... 632,UG0 tons                  January 193u..... 792,000 tons.The figure of 632,000 tons is a revised figure.   The figuregiven last month was 663,UOO tons, but this has been revised and is now given as 632,000 tons.   As I say, in January itwas 792,000 tons.   I think that will be found to be a record figure.      /ith regard to Spain, a certain amount of correspondenceis taking place between this country and Spain.   Spanishconsumers seem to think that the present affords a good opportunity to get some alterations made with regard to theimport restrictions on coal  into Spain, and it has beensuggested that they themselves should take the matter up with their own Government to begin with, in the hope thatthe British Government will support them.
     Shipping freights are still very low,  hoth coastwiseand overseas and altogether the prospect there is  far fromencouraging.   There are 70 steamers  laid up in the  Tynealone, and In fact there are no bertha for  any more.Similar conditions, I am afraid, prevail in other  ports.     In Northumberland they have again revived the schemeof making minimum prices as things are getting on  a  seriouslevel, although in the five eountios.; , to keep prices upfor abroad, they put on a subsidy of 3/- a  ton to  reducethe price abroad, so that we are in a rather peculiarposition at the moment.     MR. W. R. SMITH:   Would a re-arrangement in  theSpanish position be very helpful?     MR, RIDLEY vYARHAM:   Very helpful indeed, because atthe moment everything counts and the figures I gave  lastmonth chow a reduction as compared with 1913 of something like 2% million,* I think it was.     MR. GILLETT:   Did you say that low freights  were badfor the coal trade?     MR. RIDLEY  ARHAMi   On the contrary they are very helpful for our overseas trade.   The unfortunate  thing isthat we do not seem to be able to take advantage of thembecause there is very little new business coming forward.The foreigners who last year came across to buy were ratheralarmed at the idea of a subsidy being givon for exportsthis year, it would leave them in the position that  their competitors might buy with the subsidy, and so theydeclined to buy,   We havehad a mild winter and they didnot want so much, and in the meantime Poland have  reduced their prices on account of the failure of the agreement inGermany, so they are now rather going to Poland and werather missed our opportunity.     MR. W. R. SMITH:   I would like to thank you all forthe information conveyed.   I hope we shall have more hopeful reports next month.(The proceedings  terminated)VIM
APPENDIX.     SIR WALTER RAINE,  wrote:-                            COAL.     The shipments of Coal from the North-east Ports, stillcontinue on a very high level, but unfortunately there are signs that these are likely to fall.   Prices have had amost severe shake-out during the past four weeks, and BestCoking Coals can be purchased to-day quite easily at 14/6P.o.b.  which is at least l/6 lower than at the beginning ofFebruary.   Steam Coals have also fallen very appreciably,and Gas Coals of the Best qualities, which have withstoodthe general collapse up to now, are showing signs of greatweakness.                        GENERAL TRADE.     There is no doubt that this state of affairs is notcommon to the Coal Trade, because in the reports whichhave been coming to me as President of the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce, I notice in pr-acticallyevery instance, with only mere verbal differences, suchsentences as the following:-            &quot;There has been little or no change in             the Market.   Orders are on the small             side.   The policy of buying for             Immediate requirements only still             continues &quot;and the whole situation of trade may be summed up in areport by the Chairman of the Hide and Leather section ofthe Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, who states that he hasbeen engaged in this section of Commerce for over sixtyyears, and has seen many ups and downs, but he does notremember such an uncomfortable time as we are passing through at present.   He goes on to say that the Tanningbusiness is no exception, as in most branches of Commerce,there seems to be a lack of confidence and an absence of stability in prices.     MR. MITCHELL sent the following report:-                            COAL.     The position has not improved during the past month.The cold weather which lasted for some weeks had. some effecton the sales of house coal, but there has been a poor demandfor shipment, and, as a consequence, there has been muchidle time at Collieries, especially on the East Coast.There has been a further fall in prices especially in prices for small coal, and no forward sales are being made.
     The reports from the Continent are all had.   Thereare heavy stocks and, in some cases, no room for furtherimports.   It is reported for example, that in Hamburgthere is a stock of 6C,0uu tons of rouble Nuts ascompared with practically nothing at the same time lastyear, and at Kiel some of the stores are completelyfilled.   Some of the foreign merchants refuse supplies on any conditions, and contracts are not being taken up.Polish shipments at Dantzig and Gdynia were large InJanuary and the price  is being cut to maintain shipments.     The outlook generally at present is very bad.                      run AND STEEL.     Pig Iron.   In January 7,194 tons of Indian BasicPig  Iron were imported into Scotland.   Further saleshave been made for the last six months of the year and prices are further reduced.     Neither Scottish nor English Pig Iron can compete with the price.     Foundry Pig Iron is now also being imported at low prices from Belgium, France and India, the quantity inJanuary being 4,783 tons.     Steel Trade.   Works have been rather better employedin February but&quot;the demand is again falling off and therehas been 3hort time.     During February some shipbuilding orders have beenplaced but it is reported that there are few enquiries and,owing to the position of the freight market, the prospects^are  not good.     The Scrap position continues easy and there areabundant supplies.   In January the imports into scotland were 13,448 tons against only 376 tons exported.   Theimports included an exceptional quantity of 11,2(JC tons from Argentine.     The imports of Steel into Scotland continue heavy.     Tube Trade.   There is still a fair demand for certainclasses of Tubes, but in other kinds the depressioncontinues and there  is much idle time at some of the Works.                     AUSTRALIAN TRAPS.     The position in Australia is making trade difficultwith that Dominion.   The cost of telegraphic remittanceis now  about   4 per cent.   This will ultimately requireto be paid by those  In Australia, but meantime business is being kept back and the cost is telling very hardlyon those who have contracts for shipment.
IRON AND STEEL.     MR. PUGH wrote:-     From reports received it would appear that no improvementin the iron and steel industry has taken place during the past month, trade still remaining irregular and manufacturers arecomplaining that very few long contracts have been placed, themajority of the work being for small orders requiring earlydelivery.

     Report sent In by National Federation of Iron and SteelM anuf ac tur e r s:-     Production of iron and steel in February was fairlywell maintained on the whole and in fact may prove to be at a slightly higher rate than in January, owing to January outputhaving been affected by New Year holidays In Scotland.  new orders are, however, very slow in coming in and in some casesstocks, especially of pig iron, are accumulating.  Reports frorrthe North East Coast indicate that the prospects for that area are unsatisfactory and that there is a decrease in the order books compared with the previous month.  Demand both for thehome and export trade is quiet.  TYlth regard to the home trade the depression In the shipbuilding industry is very marked andspecifications scarce, while the constructional and engineering trades appear to be short of work.  Demand for the motorcarindustry has also fallen off and buyers appear to be awaiting the decision of the Government with regard to the motor duties.No big orders are being booked, and such business as is being placed is for small lots for early delivery.     In Scotland production is continuing at a fairly satisfactory rate although considerably short of capacity.Orders are coming in at a slightly better pace due to a numberof new contracts having been placed on the Clyde.  Shipbuildingon the Clyde appears at the moment to be In a slightly healthiercondition and outputs from the yards should exceed in tonnagewhat has been the case for some months hitherto.  The orders are, however, not for a great tonnage but are spread over anumber of smaller vessels, the material required is therefore not of the kind to produce high output in the steel ---ortcs:shipbuilding material, however, continues to take up the major part of production.  In the case of export it is a struggle toobtain business and no new contracts of any importance havebeen received recently.     The outlook both in the Midlands and South Wales isregarded as unsatisfactory and there is a decrease in the order books in both districts as compared &apos;&quot;ith the previous month.In other districts - the North &quot;/est Coast, South Staffordshireand Sheffield - markets are characterised as dully andinactive.

There Is little fresh to  add to the  February observations.    Unemployment and part-time  employment  is,  unfortunately,    only too prevalent.   In all branches of  the Private Car    Industry there is evidence  that accumulation of  stocks    exists, and unless anything unexpected occurs, considerable    anxiety must be felt for  the Immediate future.2,  Commercial Vehicle output Is maintained.   This is  assisted    by orders from the Railway  Companies,  *ar  Office and  India    Office, and by the larger omnibus  undertakings.         There are definite indications  of a restriction  in    demand on the part of the small operator.         The business for the lighter  weights  of goods carrying    trucks Is fairly consistent.3.  Exports, broadly speaking,  are maintained, particularly in    the smaller class of British light car.         Australia presents considerable anxieties,  due to  an    apparent endeavour to restrict imports to  the fullest    extent, in order to conserve their credit  position.   Our    information from the Dominion is that  certain American    importers are left with wholly excessive stocks, which  they    are beginning to liquidate  at a considerable price reduction.4.  Apart altogether from the feeling  of uncertainty,  there is    every reason to believe that customers are postponing any    deeision to purchase imported cars,  in view of the uncertainty    of the ivicKenna Duty question.5.  From reports received, it would seem that  the secondhand    car situation, which has  always been a subject for anxiety,    is perhaps less serious today than in the  last year.  There    exists undoubtedly a feeling that  many -potential customers    for motor card are postponing any  decision to change  their  *    old cars for new models,  pending the announcement  of  the    Budget.         Subject to the general financial statement, and  to the    removal of any fear that  drastic additions to taxation    burdens are to be imposed^  there would seem reason to hope    for a renewal of demand for motor  cars before the  end of April,

COTTON.     MR. H.l- . LEE, w rote:-     I regret to say that I cannot report any improvementwhatever in trade since the meeting of last month.  The rawmaterial continues to fall, and as Ion- as that continues It is out of all question that there should be any height of orderspassing through.  I should estimate that during the pa,st month in the fine trade there has certainly not been a  sufficient weightof business to keep more than 50 per cent of the machinery going,and it Is probable that, at the present time, at  the very least,25 per cent is standing or rorkinp: short time.  The heavy tradeI-y, as far as I can ascertain, somewhat in the same position.One can only hope that &quot;when raw material steadies in price andthe trade generally, both at home and abroad, recoversconfidence in their ability to make or buy goods  which will not further depreciate in value, the business of the  country maysho w imp. ro veme nt.     There Is little doubt in my mind also that the uncertainty of the provisions of the Budget are seriously affecting at anyrate the home market, and that if, &quot;hen these are kno^n, theyprove to be reassuring, it will give quite a little impetus totrade, more particularly the home trade.

HAMILTON wrote: -     The whole of the Wool Textile Industry has &quot;been looking forward with the greatest interest and anxiety to the issue ofthe report by Lord MacMillan, who was entrusted by theMinistry of Labour with the task of investigating the state ofthis Industry.  The report in question was published onMarch 6th, and to-day the Joint Industrial Council are meeting to discuss Lord MacMillan1s recommendations.     Amongst the more important of these is the statement that a reduction of wages is imperative, the figures proposedbeing approximately     reduction in the case of time workers,and     in the case of piece workers.  A solution of theproblems facing the Textile Industry would bo immenselysimplified by the willing adoption, on both sides, ofLord MacMi11an&apos;s recommend at ions.     The general machinery activity throughout the whole industry is practically unaltered from last month, butthere are quite noticeable deviations in the sectionbranches of the Industry.     One noticeable feature is the closing down of two Spinningfirms and one Spinner-Manufacturer, in addition to thedestruction of looms affecting approximately 2ou workpeople.     In the Worsted Industry the Combing Department is down,and a like report is true of the Spinning and FinishingDepartments *     -,o far as the Woollen Section is concerned, the Cardingand Spinning Departments show slight improvements, except inHuddersfield, Zest of England and Scotland.  This is indicativeof increased production in weaving, mending and finishing,  Inthe Rag-Pulling branch there is a slight improvement.     In the Worsted weaving branch the activity is down.     Dress Goods shew a slight improvement but -artificial silk production is worse.

In the Heavy 7oollen branch manufacturing shews animprovement especially in Halifax, Calder Vale, Yeadon andTest of England districts.     Huddersfield Toollen weaving is consistent with Itsspinning, and is reported to be about even.

Hawick Hosiery Trade.  Since the beginning of the yearthis trade both in the underwear and. outerwear  sectionshas been worse than it has been  at any period since  the War,and the prospects are  far  from encouraging.   Manufacturers1travellers report a great  want of confidence among retailersall over the 0 ountry  and business is very hard  to get.This has naturally led to  a  very considerable increase  in umemployment and under employment,  the local figures forwhich have swelled considerably.      No doubt  the mild open winter has  contributed somewhatto  the  slackness in the underwear end.  of  the trade,  but  itshould  not have affected  outerwear, and although makershave  been producing no end. of novelties thby are not sellingwell.   Manufacturers&apos; travellers report  that the market&apos;seems  to  be  flooded with  foreign goods which have neitherthe quality  nor the finish of Hawick goods  but  look  welland are much cheaper.

The Bank Rate has now beenreduced five times since its high level of     last Autumn
and each time the course of events has been very much thesame.   The Bank Rate is no sooner reduced because marketrates have fallen out of touch with it than one market ratesproceed to fall considerably lower u.,til they are againcompletely out of touch with the new Bank Rate and the same thing happens all over again.     The Bank Rate was reduced from 5% to 4-f/2 on February 6thbecause Bill Rates had fallen below 4/i and a month later,on the 6th March, the Bill Rates having, fallen well belowZzfo,  the Bank Rate was further reduced to 4$.   Now only aweek later the Bill Rate is gravitating towards 3;t and thereis again a gap of about 1% between Bank Rate and Bill rate and the 4% Bank Rate, like its predecessors, can no longer be called effective.     Although the New York Federal Reserve Rate did not follow our Bank Rate downwards last week it is expected soon to do so because the present fall in interest rates is aninternational movement and there is no indication yet that itis coming to an end.   The fundamental causes of cheapermoney &quot;no doubt lie in world-wide trade depression and the low prices to which many staple commodities have fallen but thetendency is certainly accentuated here in London by the rapid reduction of the Government floating debt that hastanen place this year.   Treasury Bills have already beenreduced, by  134,000,000 this year and this, combined with a natural shortage of ordinary commercial bills, has curtailedthe Bill Market&apos;s stock-in-trade to a serious extent andhas precipitated the fall in interest rates.     The foreign exchanges are firm, in spite of rapidlyfalling Interest rates here, and the Bank of England&apos;s goldposition does not seem to have given any recent cause for anxiety.   The gold reserve stands at about  152,000,000 andthere are said to be large shipments of Australian gold onthe way.     The Stock Exchange is very inactive and gilt edgedstoctcs alone show any firmness .   There have been a numberof new issues lately but they have nearly all resulted in thegreater portion being left in the hands of underwriters.Although cheap money and the prospect of still cheapermoney would normally give a fillip to the investment marketsthere seems little  chance of this happening until the budget is out of the way.                      DISTRIBUTING TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BURBJDGE  wrote :-     Comparisons between turnover  figures in  Februarywith those of the  corresponding month last year, areapt to be misleading, unless due  consideration isgiven to external  factors which have been operating.
     In 1929, February figures were seriously affected bythe excessively cold weather which then prevailed, andresults this year might be regarded as unduly favourableowing to the low standard with which the comparison is made.This &quot;&quot;year the weather has been favourable rather thanotherwise, and has certainly helped to promote trading conditions in what is always a difficult month.  On theother hand, the unfavourable circumstances to which attention has frequently been drawn during the last few months arestill operating with undiminished force.  Reports ofrestricted purchasing power among the public are numerousfrom, all parts of the country.  The protracted depressionin the basic Industries is bound to have its effect throughthe restricted retail purchases of those engaged in them.The uncertainty, and the lack of confidence which itundoubtedly creates, in connection with taxation and the intentions of the C:overnrnent regarding the silk and other duties, is beginning to exert its maximum influence,especially at the better end of the trade.  Nevertheless,making due allowance for these conditions, the month has proved not unsatisfactory, and In the case of a few Storesvho have vigorously gone out for the business, results havebeen highly satisfactory and they have succeeded inrecovering substantially more than the trade which was lostowing to unfavourable weather in February 1929.     Turning to individual results, end taking the hsst EndStores first, the falls In piece goods average over 15&quot;,but exceptionally one or two Stores have succeeded inregistering increases.  The ?-omen&apos;s wear departments havedone uniformly well, and against one minor fall there is along string of increases averaging some 12 .  Sales in themen^s wear departments, on the other hand, appear to havefallen off severely, manv falls being in excess of 20r:;,while decreased sales have also been generally experiencedboth in the boot and furniture &quot; departments, the fallsaveraging 7 and 10  respectively.  The foodstuffs departments are up uniformly by an average of 12&quot;&quot;, but the sportsdepartments are down by rather more than that amountj  thereason for the latter movement in most oases is the large increase in sales which occurred in this department during february 1929 owing to the cold spell, which could not bemaintained under different circumstances this year.  the miscellaneous departments are also up some 14&apos;.     The experience of the Suburban Stores during the monthhas been in many respects curiously different to the lestEnd Stores.  Subs tantia.1 increases are reported in somecases in the piece -roods departments owing to specialselling events, and women&apos;s wear shows a slight increase,though not to the extent of that registered in the  est End.L3n&apos;s wear is slightly down, but good, increases are shown inboot and shoe, and furniture departments, the average increase in brots and shoes being more than 20&apos; .  Steadyincreases have also been shown in hardware, but foodstuffs,and sports departments, are down.  Miscellaneous d3p?rtmentsare about level.     It is, as one would esnact, in the North that the distributive trades are feeling to an increasing extent,the effects of the losses which have been, and r-re being,
suffered in the textile and other basic industries.   Thereports to hand show that business has been very patchyand it is difficult to observe any decided tendencies.The piece goods departments and men&apos;s wear are in most casesdown as compared with February, 1929, and the experience inthe boot and shoe department has also been unfavourable.   Onthe other hand, women&apos;s wear, furniture and hardware, allshow slight increases.   Trade conditions have generally beenfound very difficult.     In the South and in YJales the experience has been morefavourable, and more than one Store has recovered the leewaylost last year.   Piece goods departments are up some 13%,and both women&apos;s and men&apos;s wear show good increases.  Bootsand shoes are  about level, and furniture is slightly down.Hardware departments have, on the whole, been satisfactory,while miscellaneous departments show an average Increase ofs ome 11%*  -     MR.

We appearto be participating in a recession of trade which is more  orless world wide in  extent, as we find such important industrial countries as the U.S.A., Germany, Italy and Canada allreporting extensive unemployment.  This situation isco-extensive with serious difficulties in the principal rawmaterial and staple food-stuff producing  countries, occasioned by the sharp fall in commodity prices which has occurred.This fall in prices appears to be still proceeding.     The National  Financial position is also  causing a gooddeal of apprehension having regard to the fact that theforthcoming budget  Is almost certain to disclose additionaltaxation.   A  reassuring feature is the continued fall in international  money rates - especially the reduction In theBank Rate last week to 4 per cent.   The situation in. theU.S.A. where the main force of the present trade recessionappears to be  centred, is still very obscure, and this make sit extremely difficult to venture on any prophecy as to howscon the situation  is likely to be cleared up.                          COAL.     The condition  of the coal trade was quieter during themonth, export  business being less active, whilst there appearsto be little prospect of any expansion in this department  inthe Immediate  future.   Stocks in foreign countries are reported to be large, and buying as a result  is being restricted.    The uncertainty  created by the  position of theCoal Mines Bill appears to have had a restrictive effect uponbusiness.   Reports from the various  centres  state that home consumption on industrial and  domestic account is below  *
normal for this time of the year.   The gradual decline  inshipments from South Wales during recent weeks has resultedin a large increase in stocks at the Pits, with the resultthat certain collieries are working short time.   Anotherfactor which is influencing the coal trade at the present time is the keen competition of Poland and Germany for new business as a result prices have tended to weaken.   In theNorthumberland and Durham area the market has become moredepressed.   Buyers are few, and owing to the ample stocks inhand they are holding off for lower prices .                      IRON AND STEEL.     The slowing up in the Iron and Steel trade continue during February.   Up to the present operations have been maintained, on  the orders in hand, and running  contracts,  but owing to the lack of new business producers are becominganxious as to programmes for the near future.  It would  appearthat the seasonal inflow of orders has been very slow incoming forward.   Conditions in the pig-iron section were somewhat worse during the month.  Consumers have been confiningtheir purchases to small quantities, and. as a consequencestocks are accumulating at the works.   Prices, however, havebeen maintained.   In the semi-products department business during the past month has been very slack, buyers being  wellcovered for immediate requirements.   The condition of thetinplate department has shown little change.   It is reportedthat certain works have well filled order books, but generally the trade is experiencing some difficulty in securing^new contracts.   Very little business has been booked by the heavysteel works of late, and makers in all parts of the country are seeking for new orders to maintain their operations.   Atthe moment this department is relying mainly upon the supportforthcoming fran the shipbuilding industry.                     NON-FERROUS METALS.     The position of the Non-ferrous Metals trade has becomeworse during the month, consumers generally buying on hand tomouth lines, whilst confidence has been severely shaken  by the rapidity of the fall in values during the past three months.Consumers, as a result, are carrying very small stocks .  Themarket does not anticipate, however, any change in thesituation until the eutlook for prices becomes clearer.                  ENGINEERING&apos; AND SHIPBUILDING.     The condition of the  shipbuilding industry during february was somewhat &quot;patchy&quot;.   Certain yards appear to havea number of contracts in hand, though new orders are verydifficult to secure.  Repair work, on the other hand, isreported to be  fairly good.  The depressed state of the  motorand kindred industries is reflected In the position of theengineering trade.    The electrical section, however, appearsto be one of the best branches, no doubt due  to the benefitsecured from the National Development schemes.  Manufacturersengaged upon rolling stock are reported to be in a fairly satisfactory position, whilst machine tool manufacturers have-been fairly well employed.                      WOOLLEN AND WORSTEDS.     The fall  in raw wool  prices  has resulted in a general feeling of uncertainty within  th.- trade.   Enquiry has been
CONFIDENTIAL^generally limited and business spasmodic.  Prices of yarns have tended to fall oving to the lack of demand, -whilst orders arebeing accepted below costs of replacement.  It is satisfactory to report that numerous contracts have been secured for the FarEapt/  though at very cat prices.  In the piece-goods sectionbusiness has been confined to speoirl lines, whilst conditionsattached to new contracts have limited the operations of the manufacturer to a great extent.  This particularly refers todelivery dates as most of the orders are for immediate delivery.As in the case of the yarn section,&quot;&apos; the Far East has shown moreinterest of late and a number of orders have been booked forthat area,                     HARDWARE AND CUTLERY,     In the Cutlery and Hardware industries business&quot;has beenslack of late, the output from the factories being reported tobe much less than it was a year ago.  Makers of scissors,however, report an expanding business in the home market.Aluminium hollow-ware makers .appear to be fairly well employed,though foreign competition has tended to increase of late.                       BOOTS AND SHOES,    rThe condition of the boot and shoe industry during Februaryshowed little change from that in the previous months,  Vvhilsi?it would appear that there has been no set back, at thjTssmetime there Is no definite sign of improvement.  Up to tbs present &apos;ordeEs for the spring have been coming forward very slowlycManufacturers generally are undertaking an intensive campaign todevelop export trade, but their operations appear to have been restricted by the level of tariffs ruling in certain countries,                           COTTON.     The fall in the raw matarial prices during the month had a depressing effect, Middling ^American having lost about 40 points and Sakellaridis 75 points.  Business in yarns has been veryquiet and the depressed stats of the spinning section led theGeneral Committee cf the Spinners Federation to ballot their members on the question of short time.  The returns showed 5^S-,82,^in favour, 16,against and the remainder did not vote. Indiandemand for cloths has been small and China is still verydisappointing.     Conditions in the Bleaching section of the trade show afurther recession, even from the low level obtaining throughoutJanuary.  The usual seasonal movements have been evident but ina rtiUjCh modified, form and generally at a lower level than at thesame-time last year.     There is still no lightening of the depression in the printing branch of the industry.  A few works which specialisein the better home trade styles are fairly well employed butspeaking generally there is scarcely a section that is workingmore than 50rt on the average.  The falling off of business throughpolitical and economic difficulties In the rreat markets of theFar East has been accentuated by the growing competition of&apos;Japan.  Particularly is this the case in India where thepolitical situation, the Japanese competition and the uncertaintyregarding import duties have seriously affected exports from thiscountry.     The dyeing section succeeded for some time in resisting the downward tendency but the. depression has now extended to thatclass also and practically all bulk shipping lines show declinesfor the past few weeks.

January.........   17. 0            THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN  NSW ZEALAND.     MR. WILPORD sent in the following  report:-     Notwithstanding the low prices ruling at  the  moment  forthe principal agricultural products of  New Zealand -particularly wool  and dairy produce, the economic  position  ofthe Dominion is sound,  for the reason that whilst  prices  showan all-round tendency to fall, the difference in price is partly balanced by increased production.    The latter  is  dueprimarily  to the adoption  of more scientific methods  in treatingthe soil and, to a lesser  degree, to the improvements  of  herdsand to the utilisation  of  land which hitherto  could not beprofitably worked.  An indication  of  the  increased productivity of the land  is evidenced in the  following  figures  relating  tosheep, cattle and  dairy herds
       Total Sheep.  Lambs Tailed.  Total Cattle.  Total Dairy                                      &apos;&quot;           C ows .1921... 25,285,000     9,615,000      3,129,000      890, c&quot;001923... 23,081,000    10,896,000      3,481,000    1,124,0001925... 24,548,000    11,435,000      3,504,000    1,196^0001927... 25,649,000    13,178,000      3,215,000    1,182,0001929... 29,051,000    13,854,000      3,446,000    1,291,000     The total shows a marked increase in sheep  and lambs which reached record figures for 1929, and it is estimated that lambs forthe present season will show an increase exceeding one and a quarter millions over last season&apos;s record.     The total cattle have declined slightly since 1925, but thenumber of dairy cows has increased and a steadily increasingproduct per acre has been secured.   During the three most recent years for which figures are available the officialestimates average New Zealand annual production at  115,000,000.Of this total the share directly produced from the lane may be divided as follows:-Three Years&apos; Average.

For the same three yearspastoral products accounted for 93$ of our total exports or foran average value of 45.4  .Million per acre.     The exports of wool, meat, hides and tallow alone were valuedon average at  28,000,000 per head and constituted 53.6 per cent.,or well over half the total exports to the Dominion.   It is interesting to record that, of the forty-three-and-a-half million acres of occupied land In New Zealand, about ten million acres are under fern, scrub and bush, or are barren andunproductive.   Thirty-one million acres are under grass anda little over two million acres are used for other purposes,   .  At the present time the land employs in New Zealand directly and permanently more than 50,000 people, and it providesseasonable employment in shearing; sheds, freezing works, etc.,for many more.   In addition there is a network of more orless closely related trades and industries wholely or partiallydependent on the production of meat, wool, etc.
Dairy Produce.     Up to the  present the production of butter fat for the1929-30 season  shows an increase of approximately five per cent.on the figures  for the previous season, but there is a slightfalling off in  the production of cheese as against the previousseason.Lambing.     Although final figures are not yet available, the Departmentof Agriculture  estimates that the lambing percentage for the season 1929-30  will exceed that of the previous year, and thatthe number of lambs will constitute a record for the Dominion.The expansion in the flocks is attributable firstly to the raising of the  standard of farming technique and, secondly, tothe exceptionally propitious season.Wool export Trade.     The continuous and persistent decline In wool prices ofthe past few months is world-wide, and is due to adverse economicforces operating in the consuming markets.   Stagnation of demand and financial tightness are the outstanding factors, while theadoption of artificial silk has also contributed, rendering the wool position disappointing.   Owing to losses and depletion ofcapital, consumers are not prepared to carry heavy stocks or tospeculate, and  they are compelled to buy only for immediate requirements.   The whole position has caused serious concern tothe growers, not only in New Zealand, but also in Australia andSouth Africa, and drastic schemes for stabilisation or controlwere -ventilated.   Saner counsels prevailed, however, and there being no point  in glutting the market beyond its power ofabsorption, growers have adopted a policy of reasonable offerings,and the sales are once again proceeding satisfactorily.   If thearrangement is  reasonably worked b:f both sides, it will undoubtedly assist in the recovery of confidence.   If withcheap wool, cheap money and light stocks, the manufacturing endof the trade can support the market, the outlook should soon bevery much brighter.Mutton and Lamb.     For the present season the production of mutton and lambshows a very healthy increase over the figures of previous years.Prices are more or less stable.   In fact, for the first half ofthe present season prices show a slight advance on the sameperiod for the  last year and a definite rise on the figure for1928-29.Fruit.     Prospects  for the present New Zealand apple season are very favourable and  the latest information goes to show that theapple and pear  crops //ill produce an increase of approximately25% over the previous season, and reach the record attained in1928, when some 1,300,000 cases of apples were escorted.  It isyet rather early to forecast possible prices which will be realisecfor the crop, as increased supplies are expected to be available
from Australia and Tasmania,  and American apples will probablybe available in large quantities until the end of April.Arrangements have been made for the disposal of a fairly largepercentage of our crop on the Continent, one contract having already been fixed for 80,000 cases at a satisfactory price to the grower.   As in previous years, the New zealand government has again guaranteed to the grower a fixed price for all apples exported.Honey.     Present stocks of New Zealand Honey In London are larger than in previous years - due probably to the greaterquantities exported during 1929, the production for that yearhaving exceeded the previous highest season by some 60,000 lbs.Prices realised for the 1929 output were highly satisfactory and it is confidently anticipated that, as a result of more intensive publicity and expansion of markets, business willcontinue to be remunerative to the producer.   It is interesting to record that in 1929 New Zealand supplied to theUnited Kingdom and Northern Ireland about one-third of the totalhoney imported and this realised approximately five-twelfths ofthe total amount paid for all imported honey.Hides, Skins, Tallow, Casings, Kauri Gum, Preserved Meat, etc.     On the whole these show a gradual increase in productionand prices realised are generally satisfactory to the producer.The Harnessing of the Dominion&apos;s Water Resources.     This is now reaching a stage whereby requirements for manyyears to come will be met.   The first and second stages of thelargest scheme, i.e., Arapuni, is nearing completion, and afurther large scheme In the South Island, known as the Waitaki,is now under way, and will probably be completed towards the endof the current year.     There was in operation at the 31st March, 1929, four largeGovernment schemes producing some 123,500 Horse Power, and withthe completion of the later schemes now under construction, atotal available power from all sources of approxi ately 490,000Horse Power will be available.     Other Hydro-Electric, Steam and Gas Stations producingelectricity in the Dominion are generating an additional70,000 Horse Power.     Electricity  Is no* beine: utilised, in New Zealand to supplypov/er to factories, Municipal undertakings and farms, and thecoal wealth of the Dominion is consequently being conserved forRailways and other similar services.     The present  policy of electric supply of development may beconsidered as having been actively commenced when work was firststarted at Lake Coleridge in 1910 on  the first of the MainGovernment Generating Stations,   That Station came into
operation at the end of 1914;   so that the; year ending31st March,  1929,  Is the fourteenth year during which Government.supply has been in operation.    The annual expenditure by theGovernment on Hydro-Electric works for the financial year 1929was  943,807, raking the total capital expenditure on Hydro-Electric Works in the Dominion  8,467,739.   A large portionof this SUT. - about  2,000^,000 - Is represented by worksmainly at Arapuni, which up to the date mentioned had not comeinto operation.    The capital outlay on all classes of electrical Generating Stations up to 31st harch, 1929, was 14,492,582, made up as followss-SteamGasOilHydroStations   n (3) (2) (3)(30)* * f* * *   2,980,555      22,672     225,892.  11,263,463 14,492,682     In addition a large sum  has been expended on distributingstations, there beinp- no less than 58 of these distributedthroughout the length and breadth of the country, and servingall classes of manufacturers, public undertakings and farmoperations.   The total sum spent on these undertakings up to31st March, 1929, amounted to  9,320,646, making a totalexpenditure on all electrical stations of  23,813,228.Trade of the Dominion.     The export trade from New Zealand shows an increaseproportionate to the Imports, and indicates that under existing conditions the ideal economic position of the Dominionwill be achieved in the shape of a well balanced trade.   Therelative figures for  the twelve months ending 31st December,1929 were:-                  Exports.         Imports.                 55,579,063       48,797,977.     Only twice during the last ten years has the trade balancebeen against New Zealand.     In 1920 an excess.of imports over exports amounting to overFifteen million pounds was recorded, following an excess of exports over imports in the previous year amounting to23-g- million pounds.   This remarkable 1920 figure was whollydue to delay in shipments to New Zealand, resultingprincipally from War and post-war re-adjustment conditions,coupled with a sharp rise in the price of imported commoditiesagainst an almost stationary price level for exportedcommodities.     Again in 1926 there was an excess of imports over exportsamounting to 4^ million pounds, due partly to an exceptionallylow volume of exports and a high volume of imports, but to alarger degree to a sharp fall in export prices in the face ofa slight fall in import prices.

MR. KOSE handed in the following report:-     The principal consideration In the outlook  in Argentinais now,the prospect for the forthcoming maize crop.   In the true maize districts near the coast, the  crop is ripening andthe total output will almost certainly exceed that of lastyear.  Inland, however, the &quot;catch&quot; crop  has partially failedand there will be only a half-crop, if as much.  Latestadvices indicate that the grain Is ripening well.  The firstofficial estimate of the area sown to maize for  the  current
season places the total at 5,521,515 hectares, or 733,515hectares more than a year ago.  Notwithstanding the additionalarea, however, it is calculated that, owing to damage causedby drought, hot weather and dry winds, the total production will be less than that of last season.  Shipments of old cropmaize have been heavy and stocks are rapidly declining.Ploughing is actively proceeding for the next crops of wheat,linseed and oat3.     The stringency In the Argentine credit situation is lesssevere, monetary conditions having been rendered easier by theissue of additional currency notes by the Caja de Conversionagainst deposits of gold In the Argentine Legations abroad.     Official figures recently published relating to theexport trade of Argentina for the whole of last year place the total &quot;real&quot; value of ship ients, exclusive of gold movements,at 952,945,687 pesos&apos;(gold), as compared with 1,054,507,653pesos (gold) In 1928.  The returns also show that the volumeof shipments last year was slightly lower than in 1928, at atotal of 16,694,430 tons, against 17,028,994 tons, this beingaccompanied by a decline in the general level of prices for most export products.     Generally speaking, the outlook for commercial activity in Argentina cannot be considered entirely satisfactory, althoughmuch must depend upon the outcome of the maiae harvest.  Evenif this be satisfactory, however, it would hardly be sufficientin itself, to offset the great drop shown in wheat, wool and maize prices.  In point of fact, the exchange value of the pesohas fallen during the past few days to the lowest point reachedfor some years.  This decline in the external value of the currency, which has been so marked since the suspension of thefull operation of the gold standard in December last, combined with the unfavourable market outlook, have created an atmosphere of pessimism in business circles.  Apparently there has been some speculation in exchange, and an advance in retail prices hasbeen accompanied by a decline in the demand for goods forconsumption.   It is a matter of interest that the electionsrecently held to return half the strength of the Chamber of deputies have passed off quietly.     The chief feature in the commercial situation in Brazil duringthe past few weeks has been an appreciable improvement in themarket conditions for coffee.  It is reported in Sao Faulo that exports of the commodity through Santos during January totalled1,103,975 bags, representing a record monthly clearance fromthat Port during recent years.  In consequence, the total stocksof coffee at Santos fell considerably below the maximum ofl,2oc,000 bags fixed by the Coffee Institute, and the dailyentries for the month of February were Increased to 45,000 bags.Moreover, It is hoped that the balance of the 1928/29 crop of coffee, estimated at 3,37 5,000 bags, will be cleared from theInterior by about the middle of May.  Recent estimates of the brazilian 1930/31 crop of coffee place the total crop at rather less than 10,000,000 bags, which is considerably below theprevious forecasts.  Lack of rain for the September-Octoberflowerings, the abandonment of many of the trees, and the inter-planting  of cereals amongst the trees - which latter operationtend3 considerably to reduce the bearing -are some of the reasonsadduced to account for tho lower estimates.  At Bahla, a tenper cent, advance has been recorded In prices of coffee, and
                                 n o                                 ( 0apparently the general attitude of stockholders  is  to deferselling in anticipation of a further rise in quotations.     As further evidence of the consolidation of the brazilian coffee situation, it may be mentioned that privatereports received from the Republic state that officialauthorisation has been forthcoming for the raising  of aforeign loan of sore millions sterling for the Sao  PauloCoffee Institute.  In addition, much satisfaction is derived from the fact that, so far as is ascertainable atpresent, the official Candidate in the PresidentialElections, Dr. Julio Prestes, will almost certainly bereturned by a heavy majority.  Dr. Prestes has in view a continuance of the policy adopted by the outgoing President,Dr. Washington Luis, and his election is therefore  expectedto ensure that the measures undertaken to maintain stability in the national accounts as well as in the exchange, togetherwith the fostering of the coffee industry, will not beinterfered with.     The complete returns of Brazilian foreign trade for  thefirst ten months of 19:;9 indicate that imports amounted in value to the eouivalent of  73^188,000 sterling, against 73,308,000 in&quot;l9H8, while exports totalled  80,481,000,against  81,658,000 - an unsatiefaotory feature in view ofthe much larger sum required annually by Brazil to meetforeign debt services.  Although sone amelioration of thecommercial situation is to be anticipated, following upon thesuccessful completion of the Elections, for the time beingbusiness continues dull and the unfavourable conditions inthe manufacturing industries also remain unchanged.     In Chile, progress is being made with the restriction ofthe production of nitrate of soda, and it is hoped that duringthe oourse of the next twelve months the volume of stocks and output will have been brought into line with the demand forconsumption.  Retail trade in the Heoublic has recently been affected by the seasonal summer exodus from some of theprincipal towns.  It would appear, however, that, generallyspeaking, the volume of trade is increasing, and thatwholesalers are placing orders for imported goods.Nevertheless, it is to be noted that in so?&apos;ae casea large stocks of merchandise are reported on hand, particularly  intho textile and shoe industries.   Ihe agriculturalsituation continues favourable.     In regard to external borrowings on beha.lf of the chilean Government, it may be mentioned that the credit ofthe country continues to stand at a high level.  Apparently,the monetary situation in both London  and Nev*r xbrk haveprecluded the negotiation of further loans at either of thosecentres, but issues for a  total sum of SO,000,000 Swissfrancs have been contracted for, of which part has beenplaced in Switzerland, part in Fra.nce, c.nd the bala,nce in holland,     Latest reports to hand from the cotton-growing areas ofPeru indicate  that the ore ;R are in good condition, there being a plentiful supply of water in most of the valleys.The tone of the local market for Peruvian cotton, however,hc,s latterly been uncertain and the local sugar market isinactive.   In conneotion  with the Peruvian Government&apos;sproposals legally to stabilise the Peruvian nound at the equivalent of 4- U.S. dollars, a National Monetary Bill
OONPIDEHTIAL.,has been Introduced into Congress which provides for the setting up of a new monetary unit, the gold sol, which,like the present unit - the Peruvian pound - will he basedupon the gold standard.  A clause in the Bill provides forthe free exportation of gold coins and ingots, whilecommitments In Peruvian pounds, as well as &quot;circular11cheques and notes of the Banco de Reserva, will be liquldat-edat the rate of ten gold soles for each Peruvian pound.  Thecommercial situation In Peru apparently shows slighty more confidence, but, pending an improved demand for cotton and an advance in prices for that commodity, as well as aclarification of the monetary position, an early general improvement In business can scarcely be anticipated.     The general situation in Colombia is quiet, and, owingto the retarded programme of public works construction,unemployment in some areas Is increasing, and the volume ofImports continues to be restricted.  It Is, however, note-worthy that the recently held Colombian PresidentialElections resulted in the Liberal Candidate,  Sr.. Olaya Herrerabeing returned to Office by a large majority, the pollingtaking place In perfect order.      A slight Improvement has taken place in conditions inthe local coffee market in Venezuela during the past month,and exporters show increased disposition to purchase.  It isnot, however, anticipated that shipments of any importancewill take place until towards the end of February.     Conditions in the Guatemalan markets for coffee havealso shown improvement and a satisfactory quantity of the commodity was sold during January.  The change In conditionscame as a very welcome relief to many shippers who had previously sold very little from their crops.  In some instances, prices have improved to such an extent that losses to the growers will be avoided, i.e. prices ruling for thebest grade coffees are above costs of production.  In regardto the maize crop, it is probable that, while imports maybe necessary during the next few months, they will not be heavy, as the native crop is reported to be satisfactory.     In Ecuador, reports from producing centres in regardto the forthcoming cocoa crop are very favourable and therewould appear to be every possibility of a good harvest beingsecured.  The improved outlook in this respect has given riseto more optimism as to prospects for business conditions.  Thecommercial situation as a whole remains for the time beingdull.     Quite recently there has been some improvement in thelocal coffee situation in Nicaragua, a slight upward movement in prices having occurred.
