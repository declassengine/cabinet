ITHIS DOCUMENT IB  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY18 GOVERIMEilT)CABINETSECRET. C.PJ33C30)  -Co py No .   IThe Civil Disobedience Campaign and the    present situation in India.           Memorandum by  the  Secretary of State for India.I.               Mr. Gandhi  commenced his &quot;march tc the sec.&quot; fromI       Ahmedabad  far the purpose  of &quot;breaking the salt laws&quot; on\        March  12th, reaching  the sea at Dandi on April 6th.        His  progress through  the districts of Ahmedabad, Kaira5IBroach and Surat  and  parts of the Baroda State aroused        varying degrees of  enthusiasm in which Moslems took no part,        and  was accompanied by  the resignation of village officials.        The  number of these resignations is difficult to estimate        with any accuracy,  as some of them have been withdrawn as        soon as the pressure  brought to bear by the presence of        Mr.  Gandhi&apos;s party  was  withdrawn.  On the 8th April the        Bombay Government reported the total as 185? but it is now        probably considerably larger, and Gandhi has, during the last        few  days,  been largely  directing his energies to this.end.        Themoment  Mr. GandhiTs  party announced that they had        achieved their  immediate objective of manufacturing        contraband salt,  their  example was followed in various other        places in  tte Bombay  Presidency and  elsewhere;  whereupon        at numerous places  from the 6th April onwards local leaders        of the movement were  arrested, tried and convicted, mainly        for  offences against  the Salt Acts.  Up to this point                      &quot;                       .                      with        there  had  been  little active disorder save for a demonstration/        ostone&quot;. brewing in Bombay City on 12th March by bands of                                                           students
 students to celebrate  the  beginning of the campaign and a serious riot at Calcutta on 1st April, the protagonists in which were  bullock-carters,  and  which, apparently, had no  direct  or  immediate connexion with the Congress programme.   But the  arrests have been taken as the signal for turbulent demonstration of protest  of varying intensity at a number of urban centres  amongst them Bombay, Poona, Delhi, Allahabad,  Agra,  Sawnpore,  Rae Bareilly, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Karachi.   At  the last-named place on the 16th April a large and disorderly crowd broke into the City Magistrate^ Court during the  trial  of  6 local leaders arrested a day or two earlier, in spite  of the presence of armed police, and troops  had  to  be  called out.  Before their arrival aMagistrate  had ordered  the  police to fire, and one personwas killed  and others wounded.  In  Calcutta, where a special campaign of defiance of  the  law in  the shape of the publicreading or  proscribed literature had been&apos;organised by Mr.  kenGupta and where conditions  had been difficult for some days after, the disorders  of  1st  April, the arrest on 14th Aprilof  this  leader and of Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru,  the CongressPresident,  was  the occasion for a serious outbreak of riotingby  bands  of Sikh  students and others, in which in the attempt  to  enforce a hartal  two tramcars ?/ere burnt.          On the  night  of l8th April occurred the rising atChittagon^  in  Eastern Bengal where a band of armed raidersestimated at from 60 to  100 strong attacked and guttedthe  Railway and Police Armouries and looted a number of weapons, murdering the  sergeant-major in charge ofone  of the  armouries and four other persons  and escaping tothe  hills,  where  the main body of them is still at large.Fourteen  arrests  have been made, and on the  evening ofApril 22nd  a party of the fugitives was located in a strong position on a hill,  and was engaged by a combined                                                     force
force of the Surma Valley Light Horse (a volunteer corps)and of armed pftlice:  12 of them are believed to have beenHilled or wounded.        Early on the morning o  23rd April 4 persons froma train at Feni - a sub-divisional headquarters of theChit&apos;.agong district - were arrested on suspicion of beingconcerned in the raid and taken to the station-master&apos;office  for search.  There they drew reolvers and woundedthe police sub-inspector, two of his constables andtwo of the railway  staff and made their escape. The latestnews from Chictagong is  that the armed police are stillscouring the hills, having received reinforcements fromthe Assam force on  the 26th April for the purpose and thaton the 24-th one of  the raiders was shot in the town ofChittasong armed with two revolvers.        On the 24th April the sub-divisional Magistrateat diamond Harbour, on the Hooghly between Calcutta and the was compelled to order the  police to open fire on a mobof-2000 persons by  whom  he was hemmed in.  No details ofthis ^incident have  yet been reported. The latestnews ofCalcutta itself is  that  the city is now quiet, though onthe evening of tlx 23rd,  Police officers who arrested anupcountryman for an offence under th  Police  (incitement to Disaffection) Act were assaulted.  Immediately aftertheriots of the 15th the city was picketted and patrolled(the pickets requiring careful attention up to the21st) and all meetings andprocessions were prohibited.Moreover a numbe  of arre ts of terrorists have been madeunder the Ordinance which was promulgated on the 19thApril re-enacting those  provisions of iho Bengal CfiminalLav/ Amendmen  Act of 1925 which had been repealed a fewdays earlier.                                                  At
          At Peshawar early on the morning of the 23rd April11 leaders of the local Congress and Youth Parties were arrested, and about 10.30 a serious outbreak began.          I need not describe events here in detail, since they have been in the main fully reported in the Press.  Butthe essential facts of the situation there were that owing tothe defection of an Indian Regiment (the 2nd A 8 th G-arhwalRifles) this large and important Indian City had to be left fora period, of the exact length of which I am uncertain - between24 and 48 hours - in the hands of a mob controlled by Congressvolunteers. The police were powerless., but ife had been necessary to withdraw the troops from the City until reinforce-ments were received since the single British Battalion couldnot be spared for continuous duty there and with the example of the Garhwalis before them it was not thought safe toleave the two Sikh Regiments alone in the City.  Pending theenquiry to be held at Abbottabad into the conduct of thel8th G-arhwal Rifles (which lias been replaced by a GurkhaBattalion) I have not exact details of what occurred, but itappears that two platoons refused to enter the City on the24th when ordered to do so, on the ground that they would notfire at their own&apos; people.    The Battalion was thereforedisarmed without incident.  On the 25th or 26th military reinforcements were received from Nowshera and the situationnow appears to be in hand.  The fears that the neighbouringtribesmen might organise incursions into the city and the surrounding Administered territory have fortunately so farproved groundless.          As is reported in this morning&apos;s papers there hasalso been rioting in Madras City, where the police were compelled to fire on the mob.  I have not yet received anofficial report of this.          On the 27th April the Governor-General decided that -                                                       it
it was essential as a first means of regaining control ofthe general situation to resume the powers to take securityfrom the proprietors and printers of newspapers which hadbeen provided by the Press let of 1910, repealed in 1922.This has been done by Ordinance, and the reasons for the enactment of this Ordinance have been fully set out in LordIrwin&apos;s published statement.  The conduct of the l8th Garhwalisas a symptom of the influence of the newspaper campaignbrought to a head the question of control of the Press forwhich several local Governments have been pressing for somet ime.          The immediate problem before the Government of india is now the question how long Gandhi himself can be left at large to pursue his activities.  Up to a day or two ago it hadbeen their deliberate policy, while bringing other leaders tobook, to leave Gandhi himself severely alone.  They have now decided that this is possible for not much longer:  but they havenot yet decided the precise date when action shall be taken norwhether the more politic course will be to arrest and try him for sane specific breach of the law, or to intern him withouttrial under the Bombay Regulation of 1828 which is almost identicalin terms with the better: known Bengal Regulation III of l8l8.          The considerations which, the Governor-General and his council are weighing to-day in the light of opinions collectedurgently from all local Governments are briefly indicated inthe private and personal telegram from Lord Irwin which I received yesterday, and which is as follows:-          &quot;We have received replies of all Local Governments to    our reference to them regarding policy and probable                                                    effects
5. it was  essential  as  a first means of regaining control of the  general  situation to  resume the powers to take security from the  proprietors and  printers of newspapers which had been provided  by  the Press let of 1910, repealed in 1922. This has  been  done by Ordinance, and the reasons for the enactment of this Ordinance have been fully set out in Lord Irwin&apos;s published statement.  The conduct of the l8th Garhwalis as a symptom of the  influence of the newspaper campaign brought to a head the question of control of the Press for which several  local  Governments have been pressing for some t ime.

Up to a day or two ago it had been their deliberate  policy, while bringing other leaders to book, to  leave Gandhi  himself severely alone.  They have now decided that this is  possible for not much longer:   but they have not  yet decided the  precise date when action shall  be taken norwhether the more  politic course will be to arrest and try him for  some  specific breach of the law, or to intern him without trial under  the Bombay Regulation of 1828 which is almost identical in terms with the better: known Bengal Regulation III of l8l8.          The considerations which the Governor-General and his council are weighing to-day in the light of opinions collected urgently  from.all local Governments are briefly indicated in the  private  and personal telegram from Lord Lrwin which I received yesterday,  and which is as follows          &quot;We have received replies of all Local Governments to     our reference to them regarding policy and probable                                                    effects
effects of arresting Gandhi.  We are repeating these to you. Thg general conclusion that seems to emerge from a consideration of these replies is that it is improbable that we can afford for long to leave Gandhiunarrested. Situation is complicated by coincidence  ofmutiny day and 3akr Id on 10th May, and as you will see Punjab, Bengal and North-West Frontier Provincewould like to go slower than others on account oftheir local situation. There are obvious arguments on other side, and we have at present reached no decision..We are going to discuss matter fully to-morrow, butif we decide on early arrest, it is not unlikely thatthis would be carried out about the 3rd May.    &quot;2.  Meanwhile, I want to warn you of one important development in our ideas. When we were considering problem a month ago, it was suggestedthat Gandhi might be interned under Bombay Regulation,instead of being prosecuted under ordinary law. Werejected idea at the time, because it might be saidthat we had no case against Gandhi under ordinary lawand were therefore having recourse to these exceptionalpowers.  No one could believe this now and proposal has definitely been revived and recommended by BombayGovernment and also by United Provinces.  Hailey hasalways been in favour of it.    &quot;3&quot; The advantages of dealing with Gandhi under  the regulation are that it might somewhat soften the blow to Hindu feeling&apos; if ordinary penal lav/ were not appliedto him. Further, it would facilitate rapid removal of gandhi to place of detention, avoiding excitement ofa  trial.   It would leave the period of detentionindeterminate and  in our hands, and it would, on thewhole, make  it easier for us to release him experimentally                                                      if
    if he hanger-struck.  I think that we are all    disposed to favour the idea if we do arrest him,    and I hope it will not be a shock to any opinion  in    England. We shall, of course, telegraph to you    officially as soon as Be have come to conclusion.    If you have any ideas as to use of the Regulation or    dates and can let me have them urgently I shall be    grateful .w                               W.B.29th April 1930.
Telegram, from Viceroy,  Home  Department,  to  Secretary  of State       for India;  dated 28th April  1930.1268-3.           Referenbe our telegram of the 23rd April,  Wo;1203-S.Replies received from local Governments are  repeated  he low.           MADRAS.  Begins.   Governor-in-Gouncil would answerspecific questions as follows:-           A and B:  Hon-arrest of Gandhi is undoubtedlystimulating and sustaining civil disobedience movement  and thereforeweakening position of G0vernment.           0:  Hartals and sporadic rioting  to be expected, butif sufficient previous notice is given to authorities,  situationis not likely to become dangerous nor effects of arrest likely  tobe more than temporary.           D:  As much notice as possible and no less than 72hours clear.           Et  Arrest unlikely to give movement any permanentstimulus or attract fresh elements.  Muhammadans in thisPresidency generally view civil disobedience with disfavour.  Ends.           BOMBAY.  Begins,.  Hope entertained in many quartersthat movement will be discredited must be abandoned.  On  thecontrary individuals and bodies of men hitherto regarded  as saneand reasonable are day by day joining movement, not becausethey expect any definite results from anti-salt-laws  campaign,but because belief that British connection is morallyindefensible and economically intolerable is gaining  strengthamong educated Hindus, Gujaratis mostly but  others also.Movement has therefore developed beyond point at which  evenGandhis arrest will break it down unless very early  steps are                                                  taken
 taken to maintain Government1 s prestige and restore public confidence and to afford a rallying point for moderate and .minority opinion.  Approaching monsoon will lead to change of methods, hot to abandonment.           2.  Delay will not now do any good except that itwould be preferable to chooso favourable moment for arrest.           3.  In regard to specific points mentioned:        (a)  Gandhi&apos;s exemption from arrest is having animportant effect in strengthening the civil disobedience movement.His arrest would tend to chock it by removing the bfain whichguides it.  But its non-violent character may change to violencesooner than it would havo dona had he remained free.           (b)  Many of our supporters thought that we shouldhave acted against Gandhi at an early stage.  Many others who atfirst approved of our policy are now becoming uneasy and findingthoir own position vory difficult.  It is not possible to gaugehow far Government position has been weakened by inaction butthere are signs that there will be a very definite weakeningbefore long.           fc)  Gandhi1 s arrest will  immediately be followed bygeneral hartals which might probably be accompanied by gravedisturbances in   several important centres.  lasting effectcan scarcely be gauged yet.  Whole civil disobedience movementmay find now orientation.           (d)  Wo can arrange approximately within 24 hours ifnecessary.           (o)  A good many of those now wobbling might be pushedon to Congress side  by arrest of Gandhi;  on the other hand itis at  least equally likely that a good many wobblers would be saved from going over.  Muhammadans as a whole vi/ould probablyapprove  of arrest and in any case are not likely to join congress party in largo numbers.           4.   Situation in Gujarat deteriorating.   It is alreadybad only in a  few Taluks of Kaira and Surat, but almost everywherenon-co-operators aro gaining confidence and  friends of Governmentaro dispirited.  The arrest of Gandhi is now. an essential partot any general measures for improvement, such as would includeOrdinance  against boycotting,  etc. ,  and enforcement of criminal Law Amendment Act.           5.   No objection to  Gandhi&apos;s visit  to Bombay from pointof tfiow  of  public peace,  only however on assumption that  police would not  attempt to copo with  defiance of law on a very  large scale which   vvould  undoubtedly occur.   But  ho is not  at  present                                                  expected
 expected to come.           6.  Question undoubtedly arises as to whether Gandhi should be prosecuted for a definite offence against the law or interned as a State prisoner.  There is of course ample evidence for conviction under tho salt acts but that seems to be a closed chapter.  His daily speeches are full of incitements to broach of laws and would provide materials for convictions.  There is also full proof of offences against sedition sections, but thoir use would bo regarded as provocative by large sections of public.  To use rogu]ation when so many offences against ordinary law aro known to all might be represented as evasion, but on the other hand a largo section of public opinion might revolt against treatment of Gandhi as an ordinary criminal.  Opinion of Council on   this  subject is   divided but the majority prefer uso of regulation.  Government of BDmbay therefore propose to adopt this course when action against Gandhi becomes necessaryc On the whole period of imprisonment or detention to be aimed at should be one year.           7.  Honourable Diwan Bahadur Besai disagrees with proposal to arrest Gandhi and all other proposals consequent thereon but agrees with remainder of telegram.  Ends.           BENGAL.  Begins.   Government of Bengal are of opinion that balance of advantage is still that Gandhi should not be arrested unless local dev/olopments in Bombay leave no alternative.At present the position in  Calcutta is gradually improving and labour is quiet.  The arrest of Gandhi would cause an upheaval of labour with results that cannot be accurately foreseen but would certainly involve serious rioting in Calcutta and industrial areas.                                                        (a)
          (a)  Non-arrest of Gandhi is not having any important effect in stimulating the civil disobedience movement.  Arrestwould be more likely tw, give it impetus than to assist inchecking it.          (b)  No.          (c)  Domonstrations would load to dangerous situation as regards labour duration of which would probably be prolonged.          Od)  As much as possible;  not less than 48 hours asit would be necessary to reinforce the police in  industrial areas from districts.          (e)  Yos, it would almost certainly bring in labour.          (f)  Muhammadahs would probably be little affected byarrest of Gandhi except for exasperation whore strikes of Hindulabour affect Muhammadan labour economicallya  Knds.          UNITED PROVINCES.  Begins.  We venture to agree with conclusions drawn in earlier part of your opening paragraphregarding general effect of policy observed by Government ofIndia in so far as abstaining from  arrest of Gandhi is concerned.It has generally beon accepted in this province as well considered and wo ourselves think that it has justified itself.          2.  As regards question of advisability of his arrestin the existing circumstances we feel that, decision on this mustturn mainly on considerations arising out of conditions inprovinces such as Bombay and Bengal.  Tho progress of agitation in the United Provinces is not such as definitely to call forhis arrest so long as his activities are confined to salt issues and centred in Gujarat.  Though arrosts effected by us for&quot;breach of salt law havo  beon followed by some considerabledemonstrations in  tha towns and havo stimulated activities of students and urban classes generally, wo feel that we havo fortho present disorganised Congress Party in its pursuit of theplan which was its avowed objective hero and  which from thebeginning has caused us our principal concern, namely thefomenting of trouble in rural-areas.  Thus the contemplated                                                   attack
attack on Rao Barei]]y which had been seleoted as the centre for such agitation has not developed and at the moment personsdetailed to carry 0n tho campaign there are quiescent. If semeexpress surprise at the liberty granted to  Gandhi yet theposition is on the whole understood and Government .is. in the lightof arrests made among Congress leaders  believed merely to hewatching on course of his activities rather than to be actuatedby fear of arresting him.  If harm is being done it is due mainly to efforts of newspapers to give exaggerated publicity tohis efforts in Gujarat.          3.  So far therefore as&apos;we are concerned, we suggestthat Government of  India should decide the question on consideration whether atmosphere created in centres such asBombay and Calcutta indicates  thSflt advantage lies in taking now the step which every one recognises must eventually become necessary.  Thus wo conceive that  it might legitimately be feltthere that it would be better to bring matters to a head at oncethan to allow further deterioration of the atmosphere which wouldresult from allowing him to pursue his campaign  into  other linesfor instance the p icketting of liquor or cloth shops, boycottingof officials and  the like with  inevitable result of occureneosof those further acts of violence  which seem to  be deliberatelyfomented in order to gain an advantage to agitation from  themethods which must be adopted in thoir repression.  If we couldby bringing matters to a head prevent agitation  going offsalt issue  into those general channels which constituted  thereal difficulty in no,..-co-operation period there might be  somereally considerable gain.   Should  Gandhi be arrested  there                                                   would
would undoubtedly fee general exhibition of feeling among Hindusinthis province among whom he occupias a peculiar positionand this would extend to some part of the rural population. Butwe do not  suggest that this in itself would lead to a dangerous situation or one which we could not face or control.  So far aswe can judge, Muslim opinion which is now favourable toGovernment v-ould not be alienated by this step and there are manyMuslims who would regard it as a proof that Government is not-prepared to give way to Hindu domination.  We suggest, however,that Government of India should consider the advisability ofaction under Regulation III of 1818 since this, would   removesome&apos; of Hindu feeling on tho subject of applying penal sectionsto men of Gandhi1 s reputation,  If action is  takon we should,if possible, like 48 hours notice in order to warn DistrictOfficers.  Ends.          BURMA.  Begins.   There is no civil disobedience movemetin Burma and reaction to recent happenings in India have beeninsignificant.  If Gandhi is arrested there  will probably behartals among Hindu shop-keepers in Rangoon, Mandalay and othertowns, but we do not anticipate anything more.  It will sufficeif wo are given a day or two notice of his impending arrest.          2.  In the circumstances we do not propose to givedetailed replies  to all the questions in your telegram forGovernment of India will no doubt attach more weight to  advice from local Governments which are more immediately interested.From our. point of view, hasevor, we think that the balance ofadvantage lies in early arrest of Gandhi.  As we have said, wedo not anticipate that his arrest will have serious consequences in  this province.  On the other hand the longerhe remains unarrestod the more  chance there is of somesympathetic anti-Government movement being set up here.  on general grounds too we arc in favour of early arrest. . We agreethat salt Satyagraha has been a failure.  %t we are somewhat                                                        concerned
concerned as to increasing and widespread feelings  of  unrest and contempt for authority Tirhich Gandhi movement  has created in India  and there seems a danger that it may now  bedirected into more dangerous channels.   It is obvious  thatsooner or later he must  be arrested and  that clash must come,and if this view is correct we hold   that it is  best  to cometo grips with him sooner rather than later.   If this view is accepted, we hope that he  will not be  arrested merely forsome technical breach of the salt laws  but that he  will be prosecuted under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Oode or on some similar charge so that if convicted he  may be  sentenced  telong term of imprisonment,,  SMs,          BIHAR &amp; ORIbSA.  Begins^          (a)  Eon-arrest of Gandhi has had a very little effect on movement in this province which has so far not reachedserious proportions.  General effect of his arrest now wouldpasobably be to the good as showing that G0vornment are inearnest in their determination to put movement down and havepower to do it.          (b)  Non-arrest so far not unsettling to Governmentsympathisers generally though natural cleavage of opinion whetherit is best tactics.  Non-arrest probably encourages someSatyagraphics in a belief that sentences under salt acts willbe cancelled before long and further arrests stopped.          (c)  Arrest would doubtless produce demonstrationsparticularly in towns but no reason for supposing that theywould be dangerous in Bihar and Orissa or would last more thana day or two.  Local Government would propose to instruct their local officers not to interfere unnecessarily with suchdemonstrations by insisting on letter of the lav/ regardingprocessions unless crowds threaten to become dangerous.          (d)  Government of B^har and  Orissa would like 48hours notice of arrest if possible.          (e)  Arrest not expected to bring any fresh elementsinto movement but might even have contrary effect and itwould certainly not prejudice attitude of Muhammadan communitywho are holding aloof.General
          General remarks.  First:  So far as  this province is concerned though non-arrest hitherto had no serious prejudicial effect, on tho other hand absolutely no  reason for continuing gandhis immunity except that Police Commission.. strongly urge that it is very undesirable in  week immediately preceding or week immodlately following Bakr&apos; Id due on the 9th or 10th May, as strain on police already very great and Communal trouble feared in at least two Bihar districts duo part to Hindu annoyance because Muhammadnas have not joinedmovement.  Secondly:  Local Government strongly of opinion thatarrest should bo based on some now development.  Arrest under section 9 of salt act at this stage would bo regarded as capricious and cught give stimulus  to^ salt movement which isalready dying in this province and which, according to newspaperssome  of its leaders in western India appear prepared to abandonOn tho other hand Local Government would support immediatearrest for any fresh material broach of the law, for instancefor advocating raids on salt depots or non-payment of revenueor rent if latter is made unlawful by Ordinance or incitementof police or military to mutiny.  Ends.          CENTRAL PROVINCES.  Begins .  Matter is one about which no ono can prophesy safely, but this  Government inclines tothe view that in the present state of affairs short furtherrespite for Gandhi will bo beneficial as it will give more timefor failure of salt- campaign to show its;.If and for Gandhi&apos;sunwillingness to condemn violence to bo realised by the thinkingpublic.  In the opinion of this Government the moment best suited for the arrest will be that following on some outbreak of violence preferably in Gandhi&apos;s special sphere of influence.On the other hand tha situation in Bombay is governingconsideration and  Government of Central Provinces willaccommodate itself to any decision arrivod at.  If arrest                                                   decided
decided on, seven days notice da ould bo given if possible.  Ends.         ASSAM.  Begins.

(b)  Ho.         (c)  Bo not apprehend any dangerous situation if Gandhiis arrested;  only local and probably temporary excitement.

On tho general question the Government of Assamconsider treatment of Gandhi as hysterical patient the bestthing to do, provided defiance of the law does not go beyondpreparation of unpalatable salt and police are able without difficulty to arrest those persons whose activities it isconsidered desirable to stop.  If, however, Gandhi succeedsin starting active civil disobedience such as refusal to payrevenue or if boycott and picketting reach- the stage whenmasses of men are stirred up, he v/ould advise arrest of gandhi and his successors.

Under normalconditions,! do not think that arrest of Gandhi would produce any marked reaction in this province, but in the present to.nsosituation in Peshawar it would undoubtedly add to theexcitement.

Telegram from Viceroy,  Home Department,  to  Secretary  of   State for India,  dated 23rd April  1930.1203-s.          Gandhi. Following telegram 22nd April), has been addressed by us to all local Governments and Administrations.Segris.  Decision not to proceed against Gandhi for thepresent has been based on the view that, on the balance,this course was to the advantage of the Government, after taking into account the general effect produced by his activities in Gujarat, the rest of the Bombay Presidency, andIndia as a whole.  Government of India are disposed to thinkthat hitherto this policy has justified itself.  It has avoidedemotional reaction which might have led to possibly dangerousdemonstrations,While strength of Congress was unimpaired.It has also avoided the danger of giving to the movementin its initial stages an impetus of perhaps considerable duration,It has shown the  more moderate opinion that the Governmentwere anxious to be as forbearing as possible, and it has caused Gandhi some embarrassment, and has possibly done something to discredit his  position.  On the other hand,  the obviousinconsistency between prosecuting other leaders and leavingGandhi alone has  perplexed and disquieted opinion in Englandand possibly, to  some extent,  own supporters in India.Further it has  created a  situation in Gujarat in which theauthority of  Government,  now that the first effect of the arrest of other leaders is wearing off, is perhaps becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Gandhi has  declined toallow himself to  be pinned down to the futilities of thesalt campaign,  and his activities are likely to take constantlywider form.   This constitutes  new situation which requires  to                                                                 -be reviewed.
363  igfr                                                        2;           2. The main question which confronts the Government is whether there is a probability that  the movement directed by Gandhi will gradually be  discredited or die down without action being taken against him,  or whether, whatever action may be taken elsewhere,  the  movement cannot be expected to die down while Gandhi is at  large and constantly stimulating it. If former view is taken,  then  there  would seem to be good grounds for  continuing present policy.   If latter view is taken it means that Gandhi will  have  to be arrested sooner or later,  and question then arises whether balance of advantage is in favour of early action or delay.  The answer to this question depends  largely  on  reaction which might be anticipated  from arrest  of Gandhi, and this is a point on which in particular Government of India desire views of local Governments.   Apart from  any general observations which the Governor-in-Council may wish to make, Government of India would like his  views  oh following specific points:- (a) Is non-arrest of Gandhi having any important effect in stimulating  the civil disobedience movement generally,  and, on the  other  hand, would  his arrest assist in checking it; (b) Is  inaction against Gandhi having any unsettling effect  on our  supporters  or weakening position of Government in any way;   (c)  If Gandhi were arrested, is it anticipated that  demonstrations would have more than temporary effect or that they would  lead to dangerous situation;  (d)  If arrest were contemplated how  much notice would  local governments desire;   (e)   Is there any ground  for  thinking that  arrest of Gandhi would have effect  of bringing intomovement any elements which have hitherto stood aloof,  or  of giving  it any other permanent stimulus?   What  in  general would be attitude of Muhammadans?          3.   It  should be understood that these  general                                             considerations

Government of India would be glad to have earliest possible reply to this telegram. Ends.          We have also addressed the Bombay Government further, as follows9 in telegram of same date.  Begins. Please also  acquaint Government of India with estimate of Goveraor-in-Council about situation in Gujarat, andwhether &quot;it is anticipated that this situation can effectivelybe handled while Gandhi is pursuing his campaign there.          2. Government of India would also desire to knowwhether, in the light of conditions now existing,  Governor- in-Council is still of opinion that it would be safe  to take the risk of allowing Gandhi to visit Bombay, see your telegram of thel4th instant,  S.D.9&apos;84.   Apart from the actual effects of  a possible  disturbance in Bombay arising from visit of Gandhi,  it is necessary to take into . consideration possible blow to the  credit of the  Government if it could be  represented that  these  effects were due  to its inaction.   Ends.
