Q J                                                                        Copy No.  0  -;CP.  102 (30).                                 THE CABINET.THE ARMY  AND AIR FORCE (ANNUAL) BILL.        MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR WAR.     I circulate herewith  the  Army and Air  Force (Annual) Bill.  The only provisions    110to which I need  draw the attention  of my colleagues  are  those  in  Clause  5 relating  general to  the  death  penalty.   It  will  be  remembered  that  in   1924,  when  the  last   4420Labour Government was in  office, a number  of amendments  were moved  in  Com-mittee on  the  Army  and Air  Force  (Annual)  Bill by supporters  of the Government,having as  their object the abolition of the  death  penalty for military  offences.   the then  Secretary of State for War announced  that, in view of the short time which theGovernment had had to consider those  amendments  and  of their  far-reaching  character,he  was  able  to  accept   none   of  them,  but that the  Government  had decided toset up an  Interdepartmental  Committee to  report on  these  and  other  disciplinaryquestions covered by amendments which had  been  tabled.  This Committee reported in1925  after  the change of Government,  when its first Chairman, Mr.  J. Lawson, had been replaced by his successor as Financial Secretary to the War Office,  Captain H. D.  King.As the result of its report (presented to Parliament, Cmd. 2376) the Army  and  Air Force(Annual) Bill of 1925 introduced amendments abolishing the death sentence for all militaryoffences in peace except  mutiny, but, with   one  or two minor exceptions, made nochange in the list of offences for which the death penalty could be awarded on active service.In succeeding years there was continual pressure to reduce still further the list of militaryoffences for which the death penalty  could be awarded,  and in 1928 certain  militaryoffences on active service were withdrawn  from the list.   The position now is  that theonly  military  offences for which the death  penalty still  remains  are, broadly  described,mutiny in peace and war, and treachery, cowardice and desertion in war.   There is, as mycolleagues are aware, a considerable body of opinion that for certain  of these  offences the death penalty should not be permissible, and  in  regard to  cowardice  in particular  this opinion is  very strongly  expressed.   I have therefore decided, as I  informed the Cabineton 5th February (Cabinet 8 (30) ), to introduce in the forthcoming  Army  and  Air Force(Annual) Bill amendments which will abolish  the death penalty for cowardice and certainoffences allied to it, viz. :     (a)  Without  orders  from his superior officer, leaves  his  guard,  picket,  patrol or           post ;  or     (b)  By discharging firearms, drawing swords,  beating  drums, making signals, using           words,  or by  any means  whatever, intentionally occasions false  alarms in           action, on the march, in the field, or elsewhere ; or     (c)  Being a  soldier  acting  as sentinel, leaves  his post  before  he is  regularly           relieved,and I understand that the Secretary of  State for Air concurs in my proposals and  that theBoard of Admiralty are considering the parallel provisions in the Naval  Discipline Act.    In taking this step, I am acting against the expressed view of my  military advisers,,and this I propose to make clear to the House  of Commons.    *    It is possible that Clause 4 on which my Department is still in  consultation withthe Home Office  and the Scottish  Office,  may require  a slight drafting amendment.Subject to  this, I would  ask  my colleagues&apos;  concurrence in the immediate circulation of the Bill.  As  they are aware, it  is  essential  that the  Bill should  receive the royal assent by the end  of April, and, in view of the date on which Easter falls this year, it isnecessary that it should pass through all the stages before  Easter.                                                                          T. S.  The War Office,           2ist March, 1930.                                                       (B30/17)  60 3/30 W.O.P.  4924
Army  and  Air  Force  (Annual)                    Bill.              NOTES  ON CLAUSES.                     CLAUSE 4.    S. 138 (7) of the Army  Act authorises a deductionto be made  from a soldier&apos;s pay to pay a fine awardedby  a court  martial, his commanding officer, or  a civilcourt.   It does not, however, authorise  a deduction tobe made in  respect of costs, compensation or damageswhich  a civil court in criminal proceedings  may order the soldier to pay.  Consequently a soldier who  in such proceedings  is ordered to pay costs, as  distinct  from a fine, or who  is ordered to pay compensation (e.g., in acase where he has done damage to property) is in dangerof imprisonment if he fails to pay.    The clause proposes to authorise a deduction to bemade  in the  case of  criminal proceedings, not  only inrespect of a  fine,  but also in respect of  any costs,compensation or  damages ordered to be paid.   It is soworded as to apply both to  cases where the defendant isconvicted, and to cases where the court, acting under the probation of Offenders Act, 1907, abstain from actualconviction,  although  the offence  is proved, but ordercompensation or damages to be paid.                      CLAUSE  5.     This clause proposes  to abolish death as a  penalty for certain offences.     The offence specified  in paragraph (1) of the clauseis  at  present included in s. 4 of  the  Army Act which deals with certain offences (which from  their nature can only be committed in time of war)  and makes them capital offences.   It  is  proposed  by  the clause  to remove this particular offence  from s. 4 and to include it in s. 5 which deals with certain other offences (which can only be  committed on active service) and renders them  punishable by penal   servitude  or  some  less punishment.     The three offences specified in paragraph (2) of the clause are at present included in s. 6 (1) of the Army     114-3
Act under which, if the offence is  committed on active service, punishment of death may be  awarded.   It isproposed  to transfer  these  three  offences  to  s. 6 (2)under  which, even when the offence is  committed on active  service,  the  maximum  punishment is  penal servitude.                      CLAUSE  6.    The necessity for amending  s.  91 of  the Army Actarises from the fact that the Local Government Acts of1929 have abolished the old poor law areas in Englandand  Scotland.   The  words &quot;parish&quot;  and  &quot; union,&quot;which  appear  throughout  the section,  require to bereplaced by the terms &quot; county &quot; and &quot; county borough,&quot;as regards England, and &quot; county&quot;  and &quot; large  burgh,&quot;as regards Scotland.    It was found more convenient to  re-draft the wholesection, but only  two  slight  modifications  are  pro-posed :     (i) While there was a single common workhouse or        poorhouse  for a union or parish, there was no        difficulty in knowing to what institution a dis-        charged soldier should  be  sent,  but  the larger        authorities will in future  have  a number  of        specialised institutions, and it is  therefore pro-        posed to make provision for previous inquiry as        to which is the suitable institution to receive any        particular person.   There is already a provision        on these lines ,in s. 91 (4), but it  is restricted to        the  case of a dangerous lunatic who is to be        removed to  Scotland.   This slight amendment        follows the lines of  the  modifications made in        the poor law provisions with respect to removals        by the Local Government Act,  1929.    (ii) It is made  clear that the words  in s. 91 (2) &quot; is        &quot; in such a state of health  as  not to be liable        &quot; to suffer  bodily  or  mental   injury  by his        &quot; removal&quot; apply to  all  cases falling within        the section, and not merely  to persons  who are        dangerous lunatics.    The  date,  16th  May  1930,  mentioned  in  sub-section (2) of the new clause  is the date upon whichthe Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929, comes intooperation.
                     CLAUSE 7.    This clause makes  in  s. 145  (1) of  the  Army Actanother  small  amendment  consequential  upon  thepassing of the Local Government Acts of 1929.                     CLAUSE 8.    By the  Government of India (Aden) Act, 1929, andan  Order in Council made  thereunder, the  military government of  the Settlement  of  Aden v/as transferred from the Governor-General  of India  hi  Council to the resident and  Commander-in-Chief  at Aden,  who  inrespect of his military command is directly subordinateto the Home Government.   The  object of the presentclause  is to  effect a  consequential amendment in theArmy  Act making  it  clear that, as a result of thetransfer of  military command, Aden is for the purposesof the Army  Act treated  as  a  &quot; colony&quot;  under thegovernorship of the Resident and Commander-in-Chief.                     CLAUSE 9.    The effect of this clause, coupled with  Schedule II.,is to make in the Air Force Act  similar amendments  tothose made  by this Part of the Bill  in  the  Army Act,subject to  any necessary modifications arising from thefact that the phraseology  of the  two Acts is,  in  some sections, not identical.  Thus, in s. 5 the numbering  ofthe  paragraphs  differs, because  the Air  Force  Actmentions  two  offences,  relating  to   &quot;  aircraft &quot;  and&quot; operations in  the air&quot; which  have  no  counterpart  inthe Army Act  ; on the  other hand certain expressionsin the  Army Act referring to &quot; drums,&quot;  &quot; swords,&quot; &amp;c,never found a place in the Air Force Act.    S. 27 of the Army and Air  Force (Annual) Act.1920, and  s. 14 of the&quot; Army (Annual) Act, 1904 (also referred to in Schedule II.) are the sections which  make provision as to  the date upon which amendments of theArmy and Air Force Acts made by any Annual Act areto come into operation at home and abroad respectively,i.e.,  in the absence of any express  provision,  on thedate as from which the Acts  are  continued in force for another year.
