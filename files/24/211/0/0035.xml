The  question of constructing  a railway from      Haifa  to Baghdad with government  aid was first raised in      February,  1928,  when Sir John Cadruan, the Chairman of the      Turkish Petroleum Company,  (now the Iraq Petroleum Company)      indicated  that  if the railway was built, it  would in      all  probability  ensure the  Iraq-Mediterranean oil      pipeline following that route.    In 1928 a  Sub-Committee of      the  Committee  of Imperial Defence investigated the whole      problem.    In  a  comprehensive Report,(C.I.D.  Paper No.      886-B,  dated 13th June, 1928) after intimating inter alia      that the only  way of placing beyond doubt the construction      of an  oil  pipeline within British controlled territory      would  be by making arrangements for the construction of a      Baghdad-Haifa railway in collaboration with  the  Oil      Companies,  the view was expressed that having regard to      the uncertainty  then surrounding  the whole matter,  no      action  was  necessary or desirable at that time.      2.     In August,  1929,  the  Prime  Minister invited a      Cabinet Committee  to advise as to the political  aspects of      the construction of this  railway  and/or pipeline from      Baghdad to  Haifa in view  of the fear that the French Government      might forestall  the  British Government in the construction      of a railway from  the. Mediterranean to the Euphrates.      A majority  Report  (CP. 247(29))  signed by the
three Members of the Committee recommended inter alia,that His Majesty&apos;s Government should carry out a sxirveyof the Haifa alignment, hut that no final decision shouldbe made until the survey had been completed. .  OtherMembers of the Committee were opposed to any action beingtaken at the moment.3.        The Cabinet at its meeting on the 25thSeptember, 1329, considered the Report and decided that no immediate decision should be taken, but that the situation should be carefully watched more particular^ from thepoint of view of any action the French might take in thedirection of constructing the proposed railway to the syrian frontier (Cabinet 35(29) Conclusion 6).    COMPOSITION AND T3RMS OF REFERENCE OF PRESENT committee .        At a meeting on 26th March, 1930, (Cabinet 17(30)  Conclusion 3),  the Cabinet were informed that certainfresh evidence of a highly confidential character had beenreceived to the effect that the French were making every endeavour to secure an alignment of the pipe-lineterminating at Beirut, and that they were likely toconstruct a railway from the Euphrates to Horns Yirith theobject of ensuring this alignment.          The Cabinet agreed:-          (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as              follows:-              The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,              The Secretary of State for the Colonies,              The Secretary of State for War,           ,              The Secretary of State for Air,             - should consider the whole situation very              carefully and submit a Report to the Cabinet              at the earliest possible moment.          (b) That the Committee should set up an Inter-              Departmental Committee of Officials, on              which the Treasury among other Departments              should be represented, to assist in their              investigation.
:R JOHN CABMAN. 5.     Meanwhile  Sir John Cadman had submitted aMemorandum  on the present situation to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs under cover of a letter datedthe 20th March, 1930;   a copy of these documents is attached,see Appendix I.       The  main features of Sir John Cadman&apos;s proposals as elaborated by him at a Conference with the Committee onthe 1st April, 1930, may be summarised as follows :-       (a)  Estimates of cost, recently made by an indepen-            dant American expert, for pipelines on the            Tripoli and Haifa alignments respectively  are:-                                    Tripoli.      Haifa.Len^h from  Kirkuk .. . v . . .          529 miles      640 miles.Cost ... ... ...  ......        8,500,000       11,000*, 000Average cost per mile ...           16,070           17,200.       Moreover, the additional cost of transporting       the  oil on the longer and more difficult route       to Haifa weuld represent an additional charge       of 3/- per ton on the oil transported, or        600,000 a year on an initial throughput of       4,000,000 tons per annum, which throughput       would no doubt be  doubled or trebled in the       future.   (b)  Unless the British and Palestine Governments are       prepared to offer  financial and other  facilities       which would outweigh the economic benefits of       the Tripoli alignment,  it will be impossible for       the British interests in the Iraq Petroleum       Company (amounting to only about 23.75$ of the       total interests) to persuade their French,       American and  Butch colleagues to adopt the much       less  economical Haifa alignment.   (c)  The Iraq Petroleum Company consider that there       is  nothing to choose  between the Tripoli and      Haifa alignments so far as security from Arab       raids is concerned.   (d) The French Government  attach the  greatest  importance      to  securing that the  pipeline  terminates at  Tripoli.      The question  is  said  to have become one of vital       consequence in French  internal politics and no French      Government  could survive which failed  to secure  a      Syrian- alignment and  termination for the pipeline.      The French propose  to maintain large stocks of oil       in  France and. to refine the  French quota of Iraq       oil in France,  and they are  said  to  fear that  a Haifa      terminal for  the pipeline  would mean that  all  refining      would be  effected  in territory under British control,      in  which  event  they would  in future  have to  depend      on  Britain for their  supplies  of  petrol,  kerosene,  and      other refined products.                          -3-
(e)  The Company contemplate   establishing a refinery     at the pipeline terminal.   It would he     uneconomical for oil  delivered by pipeline at     Tripoli to be then transported to Haifa or     Cyprus for refinement as  this would entail     unnecessary transport, loading and re-loading     etc.  expenses.(f)  The Iraq. Government may be  expected to offer     strong objection,  based on  political considera-    .tions, to the Syrian  ro\ite.  It must, however, be     remembered that the Government of Iraq hopes to     derive a substantial  revenue m future from its     royalties on Iraq oil and if the receipt  of this     revenue can only  be  expedited*by acceptance of     the Syrian route,  this fact may outweigh  the     Iraq Governments  political objections to that     route-  Further the Iraq  Government, desiring as     they do to enter the  League of Nations in 1932,     can ill afford to  offend  France who may thwart     her becoming a Member.  Sir John Cadman considers&apos;     that if the British Government would use their .     good offices to obtain the  acceptance by  Iraq     of the Tripoli  terminal,  the French Government     would be ready in  return  to meet the requirements     of the British Government in regard to such     matters as the  use of the Syrian railways, oil     supplies, etc.(g)  It is of vital importance that if negotiations     are to be undertaken  with the French Government,     they should be opened on  the earliest possible     date, before the Iraq Petroleum Company have     become finally committed  to the Tripoli route.(h)  Sir John Cadman suggests  that a comprehensive     agreement should be negotiated between the British     and French Governments dealing inter alia with    -the San Remo. agreement, the adjustment of     outstanding questions between Iraq, Palestine and     Syria, and providing  for  railway and pipeline     construction.  If such an agreement was     subsequently ratified by  the Iraq and Syrian     Governments, it would serve as a firm basis for     the economic development  of the Middle East.(i)  After dismissing as open  to serious difficulties     a suggestion that  the interested Governments     should themselves undertake a vast  scheme of     railway construction  in  the different territories,     Sir John Cadman proposes  the formation of an     International Company to  undertake  the financing,     construction, maintenance,  working  and management     of (l) railway construction from Haifa to Baghdad     via Tripoli, Horns, Tikrit (with an  optional     extension to Kirkuk)  and  (2) pipeline construction     from Tripoli to Tikrit (excluding  gathering lines     and tank farms at either  end).  After expressing     the view that such a  railway  and pipeline would     probably be self-supporting,  Sir John Cadman     intimated that certain guarantees would be     necessary including over-riding  guarantees by     the British and French Governments.   The scheme     might  eventually be extended  to  include the       *     Palestine railways and the  railways  in  the Hejaz,     Syria  and Iraq.
 STRATEGIC  CONSIDERATIONS. g.       V7e attach (Appendix II)  a Memorandum by  the  Chief of  the  Naval  Staff setting  out the objections  of the  Naval Staff to the  proposed Syrian alignment  and  te  any possi- ollity  of  the control of the Iraq oil resources  passing into foreign  hands.    It is pointed out that the mobility wf  the  Fleet  is  dependent on adequate supplies of all under British control:   if  the supplies aro  in foreign hands,  thore  is  grave danger of  interruption of  supply. If  the  pipeline  terminates  at Haifa, our share **f Iraq oil would  go  far te  render  us independent sf foreign supplies axd  should  enable  us to reduce our  Naval War Reserve of ail below 7,000,000 tons:  while  the  us^ of the pipeline by the  Anglo-Porsian $11 Company wt*uid  minimise the possibilities  of interference by Persia  and  also  enable the Company to oircumve*t a provision of the San Remo&apos; Agreement  by  which 25% of oil exported  by the  Company from a Syrian jort is  liable  te  purchase  oy  the French Government. 7.      The Naval  Staff  think that the  reasons which  impel France  to  try and  obtain the control of all  the  Iraq  oil aro strong reasons for our  doing all that lies in our o*wer to prevent  French  control  from being established, and having regard  to the economic advantages of  the Syrian route they suggest that  tho Haifa alignment  can  only  be obtained by (i)  stiffening  the Iraq Government against the French  Syrian route  oy using the  arguments of  the  virile Syrian  and the danger of peaceful  penetration  and  absorption; and (ii) for  Iraq, Palestine  and Groat  Britain to  subsidise the Haifa  route.   Indeed the Naval Staff&quot;regard the possible loss of all  Iraqian Oil  as so  disastrous  that itmight in their view  be well  worth while  for  Great  britain to pay  the bulk of the cost  to ensure the Haifa alignment.
8.    In the past the Haifa terminal has been strongly advocatedon strategical grounds.     In &quot;war time Great Britain would beentitled to use Haifa at all times under Article 17 of the PalestineMandate,     On the other hand if the terminal was at Tripolino oil would be obtainable in the event of a war with France,and if France was ill-disposed or was under enemy pressure she could impose a complete  embargo on the shipment from a Syrian port of oil fuel without giving reasons.    If France was a friendlyneutral she could impose restrictions on the use of Tripoli whichwould be seriously inconvenient.9.    It is open to doubt whether in the event of a war with france it would in practice be found possible to obtain oil supplies from Haifa, even if that port was the terminal of the pipeline.Apart from action by hostile aircraft against Haifa itself, it shouldbe remembered that France maintains large land forces in Syria and could easily and frequently cut the pipeline, as the Haifa alignment passes close to the frontier over a considerable distance.FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS.10.   In the recommendations made by Sir John Cadman in hisMemoranda (page 10 of attached Appendix), it will benoted that ho&quot;suggests &quot;To give greater confidence, however, to.the investing public, it would be necessary to offer certainguarantees.  It ia suggested, that these might be obtained -      (1)  by earmarking  with the  concurrence of the Iraq Government          a certain proportion of oil royalties accruing          to them so far as necessary for payment of such          in respect of  the portion of the railway of Iraq.      (2)  by a limited guarantee  on the part of the Syrian          Government in  respect of that portion of the          railway lying  in Syrian territory.      (3)  a guarantee by the Iraq petroleum Company of a sum          against a minimum throughput of oil, and      (4)  an overriding  guarantee by the British and French          Governments.&quot;
392 j^f        It  is  in fact appreciated, despite Sir JohnCadman&apos;s statement referred to in paragraph 5 (i) above,to the  effect that the pipeline and railway on thenorthern route is likely to prove self-supporting, thatguarantees of some considerable extent will be needed ifthe Tripoli-Baghdad, railway is to te constructed.11.    The practicability of these various forms of guarantee being found may next be considered :-        (a)  It appears imprebable that the Iraq Government           who are urgently in need of funds to  meet  present           commitments would agree to earmark a  proportion           of their royalties for the purpose contemplated.       (b)  It is possible that the Syrian Government  might           provide a  limited guarantee over that part of the           railway which lies on Syrian Territory:  their           revenue is approximately  double that  of Palestine           and in 1928 a surplus  of  . 1/000,000 was  realised.       (c)  A  guarantee by the Iraq petroleum Company  of a           sum against a minimum throughput  of oil would not           directly assist  the financial undertaking  for           constructing the  railway  unless it  were  t.* provide           for a considerably greater throughput of oil than can           take place at  least in the first  few  years.           Unless, therefore,  the Iraq petroleum Company           decide  to  come to  the  financial, aid of the           railway scheme in this way, little  advantage           would accrue by  this form of guarantee.       (d)  The proposed overriding guarantee  by  the British           and French Governments appeals to  be  the most           important  of those proposed.   We  understand,           however, that  the  Chancellor of the Exchequer                            -7-
          is -definitely of  opinion  that  in no circumstances          should His  Majesty&apos;s Government spend or guarantee          a  shilling  in connection  with  a railway from Haifa to          Baghdad on  the chance  of  getting the Iraq. Petroleum          Company to  &quot;bring  its pipeline  to Haifa rather than          Tripoli.    Still  less-should they  incur liabilities          in connection with a railway which ends at Tripoli          in order to further some  agreement with the French          for an open port  there.    In these circumstances we          feel that no useful purpose would  be served by          further considering the proposal of a guarantee being          given by H.M.Government.          The French  Government  on  the other hand may be          expected to make  considerable  sacrifices  in order to          obtain the  Tripoli terminal  as their Government          monopoly for oil  distribution  xn France only  awaits          the securing of an adequate  supply of oil.12.       From the foregoing consideration,  it may  be appre-ciated that the Tripoli-Baghdad railway  and  pipeline.is.  asin the case of the Haifa-Baghdad alignment,  unlikely to proveself-supporting for many years  and that  guarantees  ofconsiderable extent will Tue needed before construction  takes place.   These guarantees may ae forthcoming from the Frenchor Syrian Governments.ECONOMIC CONSTDERATIONS.13.       It seems clear, vide paragraph 5  (a)  above, that other things Tteing equal the Haifa alignment would, prove the least advantageous  from  the point of view of the marketing of Iraq oil,  a factor which has to be kept inview  as H.M.Government  hold  some 55.9 per cent, of the
shares  of  the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and 31 per cent.of the  total oil lifted in Iraq will be the property ofthat Company.   In addition, the oil obtained fromAnglo-Persian.Oil company field in the TransferredTerritory  will have to use the Iraq-Mediterranean pipeline,and the routeswhich will carry the oil at the least cost to the Mediterranean must, from the purely economic point ofview,,prbve the most satisfactor3r to H.&apos;M. Government.14.    There is then the question of rail freightsbetween Baghdad and the Mediterranean which must vitallyaffect the interests of the Iraq Government.    In view ofthe fact that the Tripoli line would&apos; be approximately 90miles shorter than the Eaifa route it is clear that,providing  satisfactory freight rates are obtained on the shorter route,  it must prove the most economical for thetransport  of Iraq merchandise.  It has,  however, te berecollected that the proposal for a Tripoli terminal doesnot provide for the construction of a harbour at the  place and oilers would have to lead by means of submarine pipe lines(page 1 of Memorandum by Sir John Cadman):   the lack of a port for the transhipment of the trade ef Iraq at the terminal of the railway must seriously detract from the value of the route tothe Iraq Government and it is probable that thisdisadvantage over the Haifa terminal is  likely to carryconsiderable weight in their decision on the subject.15.    In  opposition to the economic advantages of theTripoli terminal must be balanced the loss t*.Pal estineof the stimulus to development which would have been                                         \
 given had  the pipeline and railway terminated at Haifa. The  loss is difficult to compute.  A port at Tripoli, if constructed,1 could take nothing away from the port of Haifa so far as the trade of Palestine and Trans-Jordan are  concerned, as it will remain more economical to ship to and from Haifa.   With regard to the trade pf Iraq. the  advantage of having the terminus of the railway in Palestine  might not prove very great, as so much would have to he given away in order to attract the railway to a southern alignment. 16.   &apos;    From the economic point of view, therefore, providing harbour accommodation were constructed at Tripoli for handling overseas trade and satisfactory freight rates, harbour dues and customs charges were negotiated on behalf of the British and Iraq Governments, the Syrian alignment would appear to be the most suitable POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS. 17.       Sir John Cadman has stated that the concurrence of the Iraq Government in the adoption of the northernpipeline alignment,  is indispensable.  It may be doubted whether such concurrence will be forthcoming except as a result of considerable pressure from the BritishGovernment.  The fact that the French are in favour of aSyrian alignment will cause the Iraq Government to oppose it and their attitude in this respect will no doubt be supported by their compatriots in Syria.18.       As between the British and French Governments there is no doubt that considerable political.difiicultiewould arise if H.M.Government were -to refuse theadoption of a Tripoli terminal after a decision had been arrived at  by the Iraq Petroleum Company that such aterminal was the only one  which,  for economic reasons,they could  adopt.    It has,  however,  to  be recollected
 that- the French&apos; Government are pledged by  the Anglo- French Convention of 1920 to  accept  a Baghdad-Haifa Railway and pipeline should their construction  at  any time up to the end of 1930 appear desirable, and also that under the San Remo Agreement,  should  a Syrian terminal be decided upon, the assent of both British and French Governments is needed to  that t erminal; it  is doubtful,  however,  whether H.M.  Government could in practice withold its assent in the absence of  any rer-y strong reasons. 19.     From the  political point  of view, therefore it  would not now be practicable  to object  to a  Syrian alignment  should it be shown  by  the  Iraq Petroleum Company to  be the  most economical.   We should, however, be  bound,  before  advising the Iraq Government on the subject, to  satisfy ourselves  that the  northern alignment was  in  all  circumstances  the  best in the interest  of Iraq.    Failing sucn  assurance it would be  necessary to advise the  Iraq  Government  of the proposals made by the  Chairman of  the  Iraq Petroleum Company, and, in accordance with H.M. Governments  undertaking, given to the French Government  into continue  the policy  of bringing no pressure to bear on the Iraq  Government  on the subject of the pipelinealignment.
 CONCLUSIONS. 20.       To summarise:   the reasons  for  insisting upon a Haifa  terminal  from  the  strategic  point of view  are, firstly,  to ensure the control by  Great Britain  of the whole  of  the pipeline and  s^ decrease the dependence  of the Navy  and the British Empire en tail supplies  from foreign countries; andj  secondly,  to  provide Palestine with the  stimulus for development  which the use  of Haifa as a terminal to the Iraq railway  and pipeline would  bring. There  appears, however,  n$ reason  why satisfactory arrange- ments  could not be made  with Prance now to ensure  supplies of oil being available for the British fleet during a war In which  France was neutral:  should  France be the enemy little reliance could be placed on our obtaining Iraq oil during the early stages of the war from a Mediterranean terminal  whether it were at Tripoli or Haifa, 21.       The economic, financial and  political insider at ions point to  the advisability of a Tripoli terminal being accepted, providing an agreement is reached between H.M.Government the Government sf Iraq and the French Government which  secured for the British Empire and Iraq the facilities and rights at Tripoli and over the  railway that  may be found  necessary, including the construction of a port  at TRIPOLI,    TheFrench Government may be expected to  adopt a generous attitude  in theso respects, firstly for the reason, that H.M. Government alone can influence the Iraq Government  to accept the northern alignment which they are certain to have strong objections to, and,  secondly,  because by the San RemoAgreement the  approval of H.M.  Government is needed before aSyrian terminal to the pipeline can be agreed upon.                             -12-
Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1.,         May 1st,  1930.22.    If full advantage of the present position of II.M.Government is to be taken, it is essential that negotiations should be opened with the French at as early a date aspossible and before the Iraq Petroleum Company have themselvescome to the decision that the Syrian alignment is the onlyone which they, for economic reasons, can adopt.HBCOMMENDATIOI-TS.23.    We recommend that :-       (1) A Syrian terminal to the Iraq-Mediterranean           pipeline and railway be accepted,       (2) Negotiations should be opened with the French           Government as early as possible with the object           of obtaining the requirements desired by H.M.           Government-- and the Government of Iraq should the          - terminal to the pipeline and railway be on the            Syrian coast.       (3) The Iraq Government&apos; should be acquainted of the           negotiations with the French Government at an           opportune moment.                                   (Fetid).  A. H.
2.APPENDIX:: ; I.CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE BAGHDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AND PIPELINELetterandjvlemorandum by Sir John Cadmanto theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs.Brit annlc Hons e,Finsbury Circus,London, E .0.2.CONFIDENTIAL.20th March, 1950.Dear Mr, Henderson,            In the course of our discussion on Tuesday, youasked me to place on record, for your personal information,a brief summary of the views which I then expressed in regardto possible alignments of a Trans Desert Pipeline System from iraq to the Mediterranean, and my tentative ideas of apossible solution of this and cognate problems on comprehensivelines.      2.     You will see from the figures given in the enclosedmemorandum, which are based on fairly close estimates made byan independent (American) expert. that the financialadvantages of the Northern alignment through Syria are sosubstantial that it will &quot;be impossible for the British groups inthe Iraq Petroleum Company effectively to oppose its adoption,unless the British or Palestine Governments can offer facilities and concessions, both in the matter of railway construction andin other directions,  substantially greater than those whichthere is reason to believe the French-Syrian Governments  areprepared to afford.    The financial handicap under which  theSouthern route, for geographical reasons, labours, is  so  great that it seems improbable that it can be counterbalanced by
(i9 any  offer  which the  British-Palestine  Governments  can  reasonahly he expected to  make.      3.    In these  circumstances  it  seems  to  me  urgent that His Majesty&apos;s  Government should  take  advantage of the  string position which it holds,  at  the moment,  in view of  its relations  with  the L3?aq. Government,  in  regard to  this question,  in  wrder  to envisage and ,,if possible  achieve  a  comprehensive solution favourable alike t*9 British strategic  interests  and to  the  interests of British mandated territories  in  the  Middle East.      4.    The suggestion which  I  have  tentatively  made is  that in return  f^r the consent  of His  Majesty1 s Government  and  of the  Iraq Government,  (whose  concurrence is indispensable)  to the  adoption of  the  northern pipeline  alignment, a comprehensive scheme for linking the Iraq. Syrian  and Palestine  railway  system by means of a standard gauge railway should be discussed with the  French Government, with  a view to  adoption as  an integral part  of the  general  settlement.    This  involves the construction-*f some 150 miles cf  railway in Iraq,  some 580 miles in  Syria and 20 miles in Palestine (from  Haifa  to the Syrian  border North ofAcre) at a total cost of some six  million  pounds sterling.   the pipeline would fellow this railway from Tripoli  to  the Tigris, a distance  of 475 miles, thus ensuring  substantial  economies in construction and maintenance and  arrangements for  protection.      5.     There is good reason  to  think that  such  a line,  whichwould unite  the most  fertile parts of Syria with the most  populousparts of Iraq, would be self-supporting from  the outset; the Haifa-Tripoli line, in particular,  would almost  certainly be profitableat once,  the trade between Palestine and Syria being very extensive  (imports-into Palestine  from Syria  are second  in valueonly to  those from Great Britain).             . &apos;            &apos; .2. &apos;
      6.    The  Tripoli-Baghdad  line Is the shortest practicable route  from the Mediterranean to Baghdad and to Persia and its completion would  link up Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey and Iraq  and would thus  give  (but  for the Bosphorus) continuous railway communication between  Europe and  the Middle Bast.  It would  also tend to link up  the principal  Arabio speaking countries  of the  Middle East,  a development which could scarcely fail  to  be  economically and politically acceptable ta  all concerned.      7.    As indicated in the  enclosed memorandum, the necessary  funds for  the construction of these railway connexions might  be  obtained by public subscription, subject to  certain guarantees.   These guarantees need net, so far as can be seen, involve financial liability  on the part of His MajestyTs  Government, who seed net be called on to do more than.promise their benevolent  good will and benevolent approval of the scheme.   It should, however, be borne in mind in  this connexion that His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Treasury still have, in  Iraq, a leeus  stand! in regard to railway matters, in view 9i the fact  that ownership of the Iraq Railway System, with the doubtful exception of the former Baghdad Railway, still  vesta in Eis Majesty1s Government, who should therefore be  able to  exercise  considerable influence in railway questions with the Iraq Government.     8.    It is unnecessary here to dwell on the strategic importance  of a railway line from the Mediterranean to Iraq and thus te Persia.   It may freely be admitted that from thepoint  of view of  the British Government it would in all respects be desirable that the Terminus of such a liae shouldbe in Palestine.   It is submitted,  however,  that if,  as appears to be the case,  such an arrangement is not practicable, it would still be possible for the BritishGovernment to secure rights over the Tripoli alignmentso extensive as to meet all reasonable  requirements.
The right to transport troops to Iraq might, f*r example, hesecured en the analogy of similar arrangements made &quot;between france and Turkey in connexion with railways in Cilicia.   Theright to fly aeroplanes ever the route, whether military orother in case of emergency, might also be secured by anarrangement consistent with the Convention of 1919 for AerialNavigation.   The freedom of goods in transit through Syriafrom Haifa ^r Tripoli to iraq and Persia might also be seeuredby special arrangements such as those contemplated in theBarcelona Convention on Freedom of Transit of 1921.     9.   Finally, if I may be permitted to express an opinionon a matter somewhat outside the scope of this letter, i venture to suggest that a scheme cf this sort is likely tofacilitate substantially an eventual solution of the manydifficult and complicated problems Inseparably involved in theexisting arrangements under which Iraq, Syria and Palestine,which were formerly under a single government, are now under three independent administrations.   The completion of such ascheme might in course of time tend to unite these States forcertain purposes and tend to make easier the solution jf currentpolitical problems.     10.  It is essential that the first steps in the matter should-be taken by His Majesty&apos;3 Government if it is to takeadvantage of the favourable tactical position which it at themoment holds.   It is also essential that whatever action is contemplated should be taken at an early date, as tire French,and possibly other groups,.are likely to become insistent onan early decision in regard, to pipeline construction, and as already shown,  it seems inevitable that this, decision shouldinvolve  the adoption of the Northern route.     11.  Should the scheme as briefly outlined above generallycommend itself t* you after it has been studied by the
Departments concerned, I shall &quot;be very glad to go into thematter in greater detail, &quot;but the important thing for themoment is to secure immediate acceptance by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the principle involved, namely, that as faras can be seen, the choice will eventually fall upon theNorthern alignment and that it is to the national interestto accept the fact and to make the best terms possible withthe French on comprehensive lines analogous to &quot;those outlined above..     12.  The success of negotiations with the French will depend upon negotiations being initiated, and concluded,before the Iraq Petroleum Company have finally fixed the route they are going  to  take.

MEMORANDUM ON POSSIBLE ALIGNMENTS OF A TRANS-DESERT PIPELINE        SYSTEM FROM IRAQ, TO THE MEDITERRANEAN,               &quot; BY SIR JOHN CADMAN*            It will be necessary during the next few months for  the Iraq Petroleum Company to reach a definite decision as to  the alignment to be followed by the pipeline system which it  is incumbent upon it to construct from Iraq to the  Mediterranean.            Preliminary investigations already made show that  there are for practical purposes only two alternative alignments  terminating respectively at Tripoli (French Mandate) and Haifa  (British Mandate).            The length and initial cost of the respective allgn-  ments are estimated as follows :-                                          Tripoli.       Haifa.    Length (from Kirkuk)                 529 miles.   640 miles.    Cost   (    &quot;   &quot;   )                 8,500,000.   11,000,000.    Average cost per mile                 16,070,      17,200,            Of the two alignments, that via Tripoli offers fewer  technical difficulties, Involves fewer pumping stations, and  for various reasons would be substantially easier and cheaper  to maintain.  The financial advantage in favour of Tripoli is  estimated at not less than three shillings on every ton of oil  passed through the line.            In regard to tanker loading and refinery facilities at  the terminus, the view of the experts is that there is nothing  to choose between the two alignments.  (It is proposed in the  first instance to load by.means of a submarine line and no  considerable harbour works are contemplated)-  It is also  considered that in the matter of security from Arab raids there  is nothing to choose between the two alignments.&apos; The Southern                             -1-
route is for two thirds of its length within Iraq,., which isunder obligation to provide efficient protection, as well asfinancially interested in so doing.   The rest of the line,except for the last sixty miles, Is in Transjordan.   The wholelength from near trie Euphrates to the vicinity of Amman is close to the IMajd border and to that extent subject to raids fromtribes beyond the control of the territorial Governments ofIraq and Transjordan.   The Northern route Is for two-thirds of its length in Syria, where the state of public security&apos;atpresent leaves some thing to be desired:  it is, however, for physical reasons, easier to police by means of armoured ears,etc., than the Southern route, and the Mandatory Governmentappear to have been more successful with the tribes than withthe townspeople.          In considering  the relative merits of the two align-ments, the Company, which is faced with the necessity ofinvesting a sum of some  10,000,000 sterling in the pipelinesystem., is bound to give very great weight to the ascertainedfact that the adoption of the Southern (Haifa) line would involvea tax of three shillings a ton on all oil passing through theline, equivalent on an initial throitghput of four million tons per annum to a sum of six hundred thousand pounds per annum,and this throughput of four million tons will no doubt bedoubled or trebled. -          On the other hand, the Company are profoundly concernedwith the problem of security from interruption, whether by Arabraids or as a result of political insecurity, of the alignmentfinally adopted.   This involves consideration of the views bothof the Mandatory Powers and of.the Mandated States.BRITISH____GOVERNMENT.          The British Government is understood to be anxious onstrategical and economic grounds that the pipeline, when built,should terminate at Haifa.
407P R hi N C H - C- 0 V E R N MN T.The French Government wish to see the terminus in french Mandated Territory for political strategical andeconomic reasons.For political reasons they attach great importahce-JfBGlGAIRA-   to a pipeline terminus in French Mandated Territory, partly on grounds of sentiment, partly perhaps because the existenceof the pipeline and terminus will be an excuse to retaineffective control ever Syria for an indefinite period-,  Thefact that- it Is being or Is about to be constructed will beused as a lever to retain, under the Organic Lav/ now beingdevised, a greater measure of control than might otherwise bejustified.  The population of the four States collectivelyknown as Syria, is about two millions.  The present cost tothe  French Government of the military occupation is statedto be over  1,000,000 a year.  The French people would bemore ready to acquiesce in this burden If they could see aquid pro quo in the shape of a pipeline and terminus in theirown hands,  It is reasonable to suppose, moreover, that theGuai d-1 Or say envisages the possibility of being able, by virtueof Its territorial control of the pipeline and terminus to exert, if need be, political pressure upon the various oilgroups associated in the Iraq Petroleum Co., and even on theirrespective governments, as well as on the Iraq Government.The&apos; moral effect on the latter of a pipeline from Iraq,terminating in Syria, would be considerable.Kama! - i.e., along the Tripoli alignment of the proposedpipeline.  The political.and economic position of France in syria as well as in Turkey and Iraq, would be strengthened by such a line, which will undoubtedly be built, if the pipelineruns on this alignment.  One would help the other, as In thecase of Haifa, and it is to be remembered that a railway fromcontemplate the construction oThe French Government have let it be known that theyf a railway from Horns to Albu
       Hams to Tiler it would be cheaper to construct than one from       Baghdad to Haifa and would move-over be a shorter route from Iraq       to the,Mediterranean than any possible route from Baghdad to       Haifa,  A Tripoli/Baghdad line would undoubtedly be of more use       for many purposes than one via Haifa.  It would connect with       existing lines to Alexandrstta, Aleppo, Damascus and Haifa (via       Trans Jordan).  It would unite the most populous and fertile part       of the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean with Iraq; it is to       be remembered in this connection that a substantial proportion       of the leading Arab officials now in Iraq are of Syrian origin       or connections.  The existence of such a railway would undoubted!:       have a good effect on the economic situation in Iraq - an effect       more marked in Iraq than the corresponding effect of a Haifa-       Baghdad railway, owing to the superiod climate and nigher       general level of indigenous civilisation in Syria than in       Palestine.  It might lead in the course of one or two decades to       the economic and political domination of Iraq by Syria.  It is       to be rer.cimbored in this connection that it was the initiative       of Syrians in Syria, followed by agitation in Iraq by Syrians,       that culminated in the decision to Instal Emir Faisal as King       of Iraq.  It is indeed conceivable that the reverse, effect might       follow and Syria might be united to Iraq under the same       severvign,but the intellectual dominance of Syria, would be       inevits. o-.e.  The cool climate of Syria is favourable to       educational institutions and to the development of a type which       Iraq does  not and scarcely ever has bred.TUBE             These con;-, iderations are undoubtedly present in the&apos;HEIAN     minds of the French Governmenti they are not, however, for theglNMENT,       &quot;most part, arguments that are likely tc appeal to the National       Government of Syria, whom the Company would be well advised to       make parties to a pipeline convention.                 The Minutes of the permanent Mandates Commission of       the League of Nations for the past five years are a record of                                  -5-
almost continuous disturbances in Syria, punctuated by periods of strife in which many thousands of lives have been lost, andthe conduct by the French of their Mandate has been the subjectof criticisms by the Mandates Commission as recently as July,1929          If there existed in -Syria a National Government withan Organic Law such as that existing in Iraq, the negotiationsfor a. pipeline across Syria would be more difficult, but would afford, when concluded, greater security.  It is true that theTurkish Petroleum Company1s Convention with Iraq was concludedbefore the Organic Law came into force, and was ratified bythe Assembly at a later date, but the circumstances in Syria in1930 are scarcely analogous to those in Iraq In 1924.          It is therefore likely that the indigenous Governmentof Syria will look with disfavour on the pipeline for preciselythose reasons which commend it to the French Government.  Theyare likely to put forward conditions which will ensure bo theGovernments of Syria and Great Lebanon specific and tangiblefinancial and other advantages, and to endeavour to use the pipeline when constructed as a lever to force the FrenchGovernment to concede shat the?;&apos; might otherwise refuse.          The French Government, on the other hand, is con-structively bound to give effect if so requested to the SanRemo agreement and is likewise pledged by the Anglo-FrenchConvention of 1920 to accept a Baghdad/Haifa railway and pipe-line .should their construction at any time up to the end of1950 appear desirable, subject always to the terms of theFrench mandate for Syria.           XX  X  X  XXX  X  X  X  X  X  X  X          The foregoing summary of the respect if e arguments forand-against the two alternative routes indicate the existenceof strong &quot;political&quot; reasons on the part of E-.M-rs. Governmentand British nationals for preferring the Haifa route.&apos;  Against
 these reasons must be set the &quot;indisputable financial advantages of the Tripoli routet.          It remains to consider whether, if the financial&apos; considerations in favour of the Tripoli route are likely to be considered decisive by the Board of the Iraq, Petroleum Go. , (which is international in composition), political and economic concessions could not be secured, in consideration of its adoption, which would neutralise some of the political objections and even shift the balance of advantage politically in favour of the Tripoli route.          With this object in view, it is suggested that steps might Be taken to negotiate a comprehensive agreement between the British and French Governments, embodying and. amplifying (amongst others) the agreements of San Remo and of 23;IS.20, forthe adjustment of outstanding questions between Iraq, palestine and Syria.    Such an agreement seems to be an almost essential preliminary to the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations.It might usefully be in a form to which the Iraq Government, andthe Syrian Governments,  if constituted, could be consentingparties and signatories.    It should include provisions dealingwith -     (l) the construction of a trans-liediterranean railway from          Tikrit to Horns,  and the linking up of Beirut  and          Haifa,     (2) pipeline construction,     (3) Transit t rade,     (4) clauses dealing with extradition, ;!bon voisinage&quot;          and other matters.          If such an agreement could &quot;be negotiated,  and ratified by the Iraq Government,  and by the Syrian Governments to be constituted hereafter,  it would serve to provide a firm basis onwhich to inaugurate an era of active economic development  ofthe countries lying between the Persian border and theLie di t mediterranean.          The keynote of such an agreement would be  railway con- struction, if possible  concurrently with  pipeline  construction.                               -7-&quot;.  A . :.   ,
 The  Iraq. Petroleum Go.  cannot  itself  undertake  anything  so foreign to  its  objects  as  railway  construction, lout  it is clear  that  the  prospective revenues from oil  royalties of the Iraq Government constitute a fund  from which  the Iraq Govern- meat will before long be in a  position to  provide  certain financial guarantees in respect  of such  construction by  third parties.       One of  the primary economic  needs  of Iraq is a railway to the Mediterranean.   The shortest and  cheapest line would be from  the neighbourhood  of Tikrit on the Tigris  to Albu &apos;,Carnal  and Horns,  on the  Euphrates (150  miles)  and thence  to Horns (^50 miles)  a total distance  of 400 miles, of which 150 miles lie in Iraq,  the  balance in  Syria.  If,  in addition, an agreement  could be reached  with the French for  the con- struction of  a  railway  line from Tripoli tn Haifa, a distance of 140 miles, Iraq, 8yria,  Palestine and Egypt would, then be linked up by  rail  to their  mutual benefit  and Iraq, Palestine and Egypt indirectly with  Turkey and thus,  but for the Bosphorus, with Europe.     The  line would doubtless be of standard  (4-&apos;8-g-&apos;&quot; gauge).     In very  general terras) the inclusive  cost of the Haifa/ Tripoli section  on standard, gauge with a 75 lb. rail may be assumed for the  purposes of this memorandum to be of the order of  2,000,000,  the Koms/Albu Kamal section   2,500,000 and theAlbu Kamal/Tikrit  section  1,500,000,  a  total of  6,000,000 as against an estimated figure of  8,000,0&quot;)0 for a Haifa/Baghdad line.  The distance from Haifa to Baghdad via Koms and Tikritwould be about 700 miles as against 720 miles by the &quot;direct&apos;1 line through TransJordan.     There is good reason to thin: that the Syrian Governmentwould be willing to guarantee the interest  on the Haifa/Tripoli section, which has long been discussed, and. is already surveyed.   There  is also good reason to believe that the                             -8-              &apos;
 French Government  are prepared to  construct the Eoms/Alhu Kamal section  on their own account without guarantees.   Should they do so,  it would fall  to the British Government to use its influence with the Iraq, Government for the construction of the third section within Iraq territory.          Serious  difficulties are, however, likely to occur in carrying out the ooheme on the above lines:  it would involve the  official participation of tho British, French and Iraq Governments, and of the administrations of Palestine, Syria and Great Lebanon in the actual work of railway construction:   it would necessitate  complicated negotiations for running rights and working arrangements with three separate railway administrations.. These&apos; negotiations would be complicated by the fact that at least two and probably three different types of locomotive would be required for use in the coastal, mountain and desert sections respectively.          A possible alternative,  which, merits careful considera- tion, would Be the formation of an International Company to under- take the  financing, construction,  maintenance,  working and manage-ment of -     (l)  railway construction from Haifa to Baghdad via Tripoli.          Horns and Tikrit (with an optional extension to Hirkuk;,     (2)  pipeline  construction from Tripoli to  Tikrit (excluding         &quot;gathering lines and tank farms at either end).The necessary capital might &quot;be subscribed as follows: -                     To &quot;be offered for subscription to the public         on such terms as will admit of participation by Iraq,         Syrian and Palestine nationals, as well as those  of         3uro 10e and the -U. S. A.To be subscribed for by the Iraq petroleum company Ltd. , and/or by its constituent members.            To be allocated free to the Horns/TripoliRailway Company in respect of the existing Horns/Tripolirailway line..            To be allocated free to____________________________________________________in respect of the existing Baghdad/Tilirit line&quot; and &quot;itsextensions on the standard gauge.   (The ownership ofthis section of the former wBaghdad Bahn:; is not yetlegalise vested in the Iraq Governments. )
          This  International Company would enter into an agree-ment with the Iraq Government- for the transport at an agreedtariff of all petroleum from or through Iraq., whether belongingto  the Iraq. Petroleum Company or to other companies.    It would.further enter into an agreement with the I.P.C. for the trans-port of petroleum from the collecting station of the I,?,G;  toTripoli for a period of years at agreed rates.    It would furtherenter  into agreements with the Pail-way Administrations ofPalestine, Syria and Iraq, for the carriage of passengers and freight originating on or destined for lines controlled by thoseadministrations, and. with the Iraq petroleum Company for the carriage of its staff and of material for pipeline construction and maintenance.          It will, of course,  be understood that it would, benecessary for embarking on actual negotiations  to consider carefully the economic aspects of this scheme.    Having regard,however,  to the large anticipated throughput uf the pipeline andof the favourable location of the railway for the purposes oftraffic to and from Persia,  and its relation to the most fertileparts of Syria and Iraq,  there seemo good reason to believe  thatthe surplus earnings of the  railway and pipeline, after provision has been made for amortization,  depreciation and debenturecharges,  if any, would suffice for the payment  of interest.          To give greater confidence,&apos;however,  to the investingpublic, it would, be necessaigy to offer certain  guarantees.    Itis suggested that these might  be obtained -     (l)  by earmarking with the  concurrence  of  the Iraq          Government a certain proportion of oil royalties          accruing to them so  far as necessary  for payment          of such in respect  of  the portion  of  the railway          of Iraq.,     (2)  by a limited guarantee  on the part  of  the Syrian          Government in respect  of that portion- of the          railway lying in Syrian territory,     (o)  a guarantee by the  Iraq. Petroleum Company of a          sum against a minimum  throughput of oil.  and     (4)  an Overriding? guarantee by the British and French          Government s.
          Such a  scheme could work only if the -proposal hadthe whole-hearted concurrence of the Governments concerned.   Itwould, however, have certain important advantages, includingamongst others -     (l) simultaneous construction of railway and pipeline as          part of the considered scheme, involving&quot;important          economies.   Fuelling, water, telephone and -police          stations could he designed to serve the convenience          of &quot;both pipeline and railway and there would &quot;be          large economies both in construction and maintenance.     (2) A pipeline in the hands of an independent International          Company would facilitate the maintenance of the          &quot;Open Door&quot; formula in Mesopotamia.     (3) The management of the railway by an International          Company would remove it from the sphere of national          politics and greatly facilitate the raising of          capital, as the railway would be worked like the          pipeline,  as a commercial concern with the object          of making profits, which might, however, limit it          in the Article of Association to, say, 10%.     (4) The scheme might eventually be extended to include          Palestine railways, which lie in part in Egypt and          in part in Palestine,  the lie jaz, Syrian and Iraq.          railways.          These railways are at  present run by the local govern-ments.    In every case they are  hampered by difficulty in raisingcapital and by the absence of commercial management.    Arrange-ments would, of course, &quot;be made  to ensure that the existingmanagement would be  retained in each section, the function ofthe International Company being  restricted to co-ordination and commercial control.          If His Majesty1s Government can see their way to under-take preliminary negotiations for a quadrilateral agreement onthese lines, they could no doubt secure sioecial privileges inrelation to the movement of troops, the transport of goodsrequired by the Ira-:... Government, etc ,  and could take  the firststeps towards the foundation of  a dynamic link between Syriaand Iraq,, which is likely in the long run to ensure more than any other single factor the continuance of peace.

        BAGHDAD - HAIFA RAILWAY AND PIPELINE.&apos; - ,      Memorandum, by the Chief, of the Naval Staff.          The Naval Staff are seriously perturbed at the trend of affairs in connection with the alignment of theproposed Iraq Petroleum Company&apos;s pipeline from Iraq, to theMediterranean, and at the possibility that potential controlof Iraqi oil resources may pass into foreign hands.          It is essential to the mobility of the Fleet inwar that the bulk of our oil supplies should not be inforeign hands and liable to control and probably tointerruption, because, when our reserve of oil is exhausted,a part or even the whole of the Fleet would have to be laidup.   Our oil reserve at present only provides for about months Fleet war expenditure, and there is no civilreserve whatsoever. &apos;          The Fleet in wartime requires 7,159,000 tons of oil a year.   Our only British resources of oil areTrinidad, Burma, N. Borneo, Rangoon and South Persia, andthe last named is in Persian territory and liable tointerruption.   Thus only 14% of our war supplies of oilare under our control, whilst 86% must be obtained from foreign sources.          Every effort should, therefore, be made toobtain control of new supplies, and the Oil Fields ofIraq offer a priceless opportunity for so doing.    It Isbelieved that these fields are of great extent and capacity,and we are entitled to practically 1/3rd of the oiltherefrom.   Our share of Iraq oil - when well developed -might go far to render us independent of foreign supplies and enable us to reduce our War Reserve of oil below7,000,000 tons if the pipeline terminates at Haifa.                            1.
          Iraq, is at present in special mandatory relationswith Great Britain and it is hoped will be allied by treatywhen these special relations cease.   With care we shouldbe able to control our share of its oil for many years,  but,if the pipeline passes through French Syria to Tripoli:we will lose this control and will only obtain such oil  asthe French will allow us in time of -war.          It must be realised that these new oilfields are so far - about 400 miles - from Abadan that a pipeline totake our share to that port for shipment would be costly,and,  in addition, all oil would still have to pay the canal dues of nearly  1,000,000 a year.   On the otherhand, a pipeline from the Iraq, oilfields to a. terminus atHaifa would circumvent the obstacle of the San RemoAgreement (by which 25% of oil exported by the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company from a French Syrian port is liable topurchase by the French Government) and would most probablylead to the South Persian Oilfields being connected up toit.   By this means the oil from either or both fields couldbe pumped to the Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean or to both, and the possibilities of interference by Persia onthe grounds of neutrality would be minimised.          The connection of-the South Persian Oilfields  toHaifa by pipeline would also mean a saving of 6400 miles seajourney, and Tankers employed in fuelling the Fleet fromsupplies refined in Great Britain would be saved some 16days&apos; journey;  a most important saving in tanker tonnage,as a shortage of 50  such vessels would, occur to-day if  amaritime war was to break out and Empire requirements hadall to be met.                         -  2.
Should, however, the pipeline pass through Syriato Tripoli, the French will, according to Sir J.  Cadman,erect a refining station at Tripoli&apos; and control the outputof resulting refined oils. very great  importance  of  control  of  this great new  source of oil  supply and d. Tardieu  stated  to Sir J. Caiman that France  attached, the greatest  importance to the pipeline terminating at Tripoli, and that  no  French Government could give away this card and survive.   He said that there was a strong feeling in France in favour of keeping the French oil industry strictly  in French hands to the exclusion of the foreigner as much as possible.   The French were determined that the Iraq, oil should be refined, if possible, in France;  they feared that a Haifa terminal would mean that all refining would be effected  in territory under British control, in &quot;which event they would in, future have to look to Britain for their supplies of petrol,  kerosene,and other refined products.    M; Tardieu intimated thatwhile the French Government might agree to a refinery being established at  the end of the pipeline at Tripoli, it was their intention to keep large stocks of oil etc.  in France.Sir J.  Gadman pointed out  to him that a policy of preventing the British, American and Dutch  and other foreign interestsfrom carrying on business  in France was not going to help the French in regard ta securing the Tripoli  terminus.impel France to try to seize all the Iraq oil are strong reasons for our doing all that lies in our power toprevent French control from being established.The French government is fully awake to theIt should be noted that the very reasons which
          Sir J. Oadman has also stated that a Syrianpipeline and railway was &quot;certain to result in the absorption of Iraq by the more virile Syrians&quot;, and itmay be.inferred that this will mean control of Iraq bythe French within a measurable period from the terminationof our special mandatory position.    Taking a long view,this may well lead to a break in our Air communications with India and the Fast, which would be disastrous.Furthermore, it would allow French influence to reach thehead of the Persian Gulf.          It must be admitted that the Commercialadvantages lie with the Syrian route for both pipelineand railway, and the only apparent course in order toobtain the Haifa alignment is -     (i)  To stiffen the Iraq. Government against the           French Syrian route by using the arguments           of the virile Syrian and the danger of           peaceful penetration and absorption; .    (ii)  For Iraq, Palestine and Great Britain to           subsidise the Haifa route.    It might well           pay this country in the. long, run for Great           Britain to&apos;pay the bulk of the cost.          The loss of all Iraquian oil will be a disasterfor Great Britain,     . .                       (INTLD. )  C.B.M.                                    5. 4. 30.
