THiS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BxxITAHHIO MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT  Vr*vSECRETCP. 129(50)COPY I30 40CABINET.THE TRADE OUTLOOK.       Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     The state of trade as shown by the reports for March isone of continued depression, though in some few but notunimportant respects there are distinct indications that afavourable turn has begun.     The output of coal during the first three weeks of Marchremained high though slowly falling.  The volume of exportsfell in February somewhatj during March the fall has been muchaccentuated and prices have dropped to low levels, the fiveCounties selling Best South Yorkshire Hards with  the aid ofthe S/- subsidy at 14/6-gd per ton, f .o.b.   The situation isfurther aggravated by the serious depression in shipping whichleads  to a smaller demand for bunkers.  The shipping freightsindex  has fallen further  by about 4^$  to a record  low  level andthe tonnage laid up in British Home ports alone is estimated tohave risen from 820,000 tons dead weight on January 1st last to3,400,000 tons dead weight at the end  of March.     Shipbuilding, which  had been fairly good, was beginning toget short of work,  there  being no orders for ordinary  cargotonnage and this reacted  of course  in  turn on  the iron and  steel trade  where other demands as, for example, for rails,  were  alsopoor,  the only bright spot being the market for structuralmaterial in London.  The  scrap position was, however,  better for British furnaces, the imports for  the first time for manyyears  exceeding  the exports owing  to diminished steel  output onthe Continent.      The motor car  trade  did not show  the usual seasonal                              -1-
improvement and this was, in part, attributed to uncertainty as to the Budget position.  Of overseas trades that with australia was again the subject of complaint mere especiallyin regard to the inability of exporters, for example of motor oars, to get their money back from Australia, thoughsuggestions were made as to how this difficulty should be overcome.     Notwithstanding the fall in commodity prices, a striking example of which was given in the shape of the priceof 14/- per ton f.o.b. in Scotland for potatoes, the Co-operative Society reported a continued increase in their cashreceipts, though, at the same time, bad trade in drapery,boots and shoes and allied departments.     As regards the indications of a favourable turn in world trade referred to above these were principally an upwardtendency in the prices of raw wool and of cotton.  As regardsthe former, the good effects of which are in  jeopardy owingto the Yorkshire dispute, it was reported both that the sales of wool in Australia showed keen competition  at improved ratesand that the primary operations in this trade, sorting andoombing, were slightly better than they have  been recently.Surprise was expressed at the very slight extent to srhich therecent heavy fall in the price of wocl had been reflected onthe price of clothing.  As regards cotton, a  steady recovery in price had followed since the second week of Liar oh whenAmerican cotton reached  the low level of 7.33d per lb.following the rise in price there had been a  continuousincrease in yarn sales and the steady stream  of orders forcloth was beginning.  This had not yet had time to producemuch effect upon the unemployment figures.  The representa-tive of India also reported that during the last fortnightthere were signs of  the  slump in prices of such commodities
as rice, jute and oil-seed coning to an end.     An encouraging feature of some significance reported tothe Council was that the fine chemical industry of thisCountry occupies a foremost position in making commerciallyavailable the latest therapeutic and dietetic discoveries suchas insulin, various antiseptic remedies and synthetic vitaminpreparations.     As regards unemployment figures the very alarmingincrease in Mardh by 138,000 to 1,577*000 was explained as to half by the  changes which had been made by the UnemploymentInsurance Act of this year in the rules as to registration^and the other half was in the &quot;Temporarily stopped&quot; group, muchof which was in the cotton industry.                                               sr.6.Board of Trade     25th April, 19SO.

CQCT IDENTICAL.     THE PE3SIDEKT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE:  Gentlemen, I am afraid I must ask your indulgence.   The Cabinet used to meet at 11 e*clock, but it is now meeting at half-past 10 o&apos;clock,so that I shall require to leave you early, but my colleagueMr. Gillett will take the Chair in my place.   I should liketo say that I am reminded that this is the 100th meeting ofthe Advisory Council, so that I think you will agree it is a particularly interesting occasion.     MR. RIDUSY WARHAM:  The output of coal in the UnitedKingdom has been-These are all very good figures.   The average output for the13 weeks from the end of December last to March 22nd 1930 was,245,000 tons, as compared with 5,088,000 tons for thecorresponding period last year, an increase of 157,000 tons per week, i.e., practically 8,000,000 tons a year.     The number of persons eaployed in the industry for theweek ended March 22nd was 957,000, as corn-Dared with an average weekly figure of 1,110,100 in 1913.   The&quot;average for the 13weeks ended March 22nd was 954,900 as compared with 913,300for the corresponding period of last year, an increase of     Unemployment for the month of February was 15.2 percent., as compared with 12.9 per cent, in January and anaverage of 21.9 per cent, in 1928.     The quantItj of coal exported from the United kingdom in February was 4,537,577 tons, as compared with 5,231,011tons in January, a decease of 743,434 tons.   The average -price per ton f. o.b. in i&apos;ebruar5r was the same as in January,viz., 17s.Od.     These figures show some decrease in the export trade,but since the period covered by the figures, the reduction hasbecoiae much more marked, and prices have fallen faster than Iever remember in the whole of my experience.     The Five Counties, assisted by an export subsidy of5s.Od. a ton, are selling best South Yorkshix-e Hards at14s.6^-d. per ton, nett, f.o.b., so that those districts whichcannot subsidise their coal trade such as Northumberland -where we have a minimum price at present of 14s.S-gd. a ton,where the difference in quality is minus 3s.Od. a ton infavour of the Yorkshire seams - have made no new seles at all for several weeks past, and see no prospect of doing so.   Wehave not sold a ton ourselves for several weeks now owing to coal.Week ended March  Oth -Week ended March 15th -Week ended March 22nd -5,423,000 tons.5,342,000 tons.5,323,000 tons.41,000.
the subsidy absolutely crushing the export market. Consequentlythere has been a considerable amount of idle time.   Our owncollieries, which last year produced 3,000,000 tons of coal,and which have not lost any time for want of trade for thelast eighteen months, have been entirely idle three timesduring the last ten days, and I am sorry to say that there is every indication that there will be a good deal more to come.     There is great anxiety in Northumberland as to theeffect of the Coal Mines Bill upon their trade in view of thewithdrawal of the Central Levy and the retention of theDistrict Levy.     It is reported that second class coal from the F&apos;iveCounties district has been sold to Alexandria on the basis of11s.lOd. a ton f*o*b.j  this, of course, is only possible by making full use of the railway rebate and the export subsidy.     Exports by sea from Poland in February show a considerabledrop as coinpared with the previous month, the figures being:January 792,000 tons and February 612,000 tons, a decrease of180,000 tons.   Polish coal, which at the end of last year was selling at 17s.Od. a ton, is now 12s,Sd, to 13s. Od.     Freights generally are very low, and a large number ofsteamers are laid up.   This has its effect upon the coal trade;  the demand for bunkers for foreign going steamers andfor coaling stations has seriously diminished, while thedemand for coal is so poor that the low freights offering leadto no extension of business.     Generally the trade both for Home and Overseas isdecidedly weak and discouraging.   I am sorry to give such ablack statement, Mr. President.     THE PRESIDENT:  I am sorry to hear, as we all must be, thestatement that Mr. Ridley &quot;ffarham has made.   Speaking purely onthe facts of the situation I might say, as Mr. Ridley Varhamknows, that when the Central Levy was withdrawn that was theone occasion on which the Government was defeated.   I am onlystating the facts when I say that we should have made everyeffort to have it reinstated but for the fact that we should probably have been defeated again.     MR. RIDLEY FARKAM:   I know that is so.     THE PRESIDENT;  There are two Points.   The Bill has still to go to the House of Lords.   I cannot speak for that Chamber,but I hope the Bill will be impartially considered there, andthat the position of Northumberland and Durham will be takeninto account,   7/ith regard to the second point, as regardsthe. District Levy it is provided in the Bill that that is subject to consentj  and I should imagine in practice, withco-ordination on the national body of representatives of allowners in the country, under one head or the other a solution for this problem will be found, because I have already said toMr. Sidlejr T/arham&apos; personally what I vrould like to say to theCouncil, viz., that the difficulty he has referred to inNorthumberland is a very grave difficulty and we must findtogether some method of solving it, and the Government willmake the very best contribution it can to a solution.
                            SHIPPING.     With regard to freights, it is a long time since theywere as bad as they are at present, and there has been a drop in every direction, except in the outward coal freights to south America,   This, of course, is easily explained, becausewhen you get a drop in the grain freights from the River Platesuch as you have recently had, you always get a rise in the outward coal freights.   On Saturday I was checking over somefigures of a 2,000-ton steamer for a voyage to the Baltic forMay loading.   Full allowance was made for the proper time,and for port charges, etc.   This was for a cargo of coal out and a cargo of timber home, and the pro forma account showed a loss of about  50,   That was for a month1s voyage.   Itmay be a small amount relatively speaking, but one does not expect to lose money on what are called small steamers.   Myexperience is that when you work out pro forma voyages theyvery rarely work out, as you would expect.   There is generallya delay, or something else happens.   This morning afterarriving in London I met a ship-owning friend, and he passed over some voyage accounts to me for mo to go through.   Theywere the accounts of very modern steamers, one of about 1,100tons and the other 700 tons.   Those steamers are so modernthat the total insurance on all risks was only 5 per cent.When I tell you that the total insurance risk on this 2,000tonner, which is also a good steamer but rather old, is over20 per cent, you will see the difference.   On one voyageU         MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  Thank you very much indeed.   We will    continue our efforts,         SIR WALTER RAINE:  I should like to supplement what    Mr, Ytfarham has said about the coal trade, and more particularly    with regard to the position in Yorkshire,   I was going to tell    you that the official price on Monday of Hards was put down at    15s,Od., so that it makes the case even worse if, as    Mr. Warham has indicated, and I believo correctly so, that coal    has been sold at as low a figure as 14s.6-id.   It is quite    evident that the foreigner will not pay us the minimum price of    14s.6d. for D.C .B,s.   In fact only last week I quoted 13s,lC%i.    for these coals, having to sacrifice in order to keep up with    my contract, and the order was taken by somebody else at 13s,9d.    including Agents&apos; commission.         Another point arose in the Debate last week in the House of    Commons with regard to the price of bunkers in Yorkshire,    When this Five Counties Schemo first came into operation, I    think three years ago, owners of steamers as well as of trawlers    were charged 3s.Od. to 4s,Od, a ton more for bunkers than for    the same coals which were being shipped as cargo.   The position    now arises - I am not prepared to say that this is absolutely    accurate, but it was mentioned in the House of Commons and I    believe it is true - that with the freights as they are, viz.,    2s.Gd, at the outside to Rotterdam, with ls,Od, for discharging,    it is possible to bunker those steamers and trawlers at    Rotterdam and in Holland at any rate at no higher price - I will    put it that way, though I believe it could be done cheaper -    than the coal is charged to the owners of steamers and trawlers    from the Humber under the Five Counties Scheme,
lasting a few days on the coast the 1,100 tonner lost  44.On a voyage of 17 days she lost  91.   The 700 tonner lost 10 in nine days, and  13 in eleven days.   My friend told  mequite definitely that in the three months ending March theboats had lost  200.   As I mentioned,  we do not expect thesesmall steamers to run at a loss, though they may run at noprofit now and again.   I mention these facts to show you howserious the trade position is.     Ship repairing, considering all things, is not  in a hadcondition on the North-east Coast, though we could do with  more work,   I observe that on the West Coast it is not at all good.                         GENERAL TRAPS.     Reports which come to me from various Chambers of Commercein the Midlands state that the hosiery trade is sufferingseverely through unprecedented imports of cheap foreign madestockings.   There was an increase last year, over the previous year, of nearly one million dozen pairs of cotton stockings andsocks, and of 475,000 dozen pairs of artificial silk stockingsand socks.   As for cotton underwear, the imports, although verygreat in 1929, viz., 2,190,715 dozen, showed a decrease of a quarter of a million dozens over 1928.     Boots and shoes seemed to be about the only brightfeature in the reports which I read, excepting building isvery active, and prospects good.     The reports also state that engineering is still fairlygood, though some of the firms find it difficult to keep theirplant fully employed.                              COAL.     THE PRESIDENT:   I would supplement my previous remarks by saying that regarding bunker coal there is at least this.There would be provision- for central regulation and opportunitiesfOB arbitration, and that does open the door to rather betterprospects.   I just mention that point because it was, as you know, very widsly debated in Parliament.                             RUBBER.     SIR GEORGE BEHARREL:   Taking the motor tyre businessgenerally, to date sales have been more or less comparable withthose of last year.   The  demand for tyres for first equipmenthas been rather less than for* the same period last year.Prospects are bound up with those of the car and commercialvehicle industry, in connection with which the Committee  receive a separate report.   As regards replacement motor tyre businessthere is an increase in passenger car licences of approximately10 per cent, comparing the peak period of 1920 with tho same
period of 1929, but it is found that the light car, up to and including 10 h.p,, accounts for an increase of 23 per cent.The swing over of the type of car has a marked effect on thetyre trade.   There were approximately 4,000 less cars of21 h,p, and upwards at the peak period of 1929 than there were at the same period in 1920,   The amount of labour requii-to manufacture a tyre for- a small car is very much less thanthat required for the manufacture of the larger sizes,   Overall, therefore, it is expected that the home replacementtyre consumption will be less this year than last, particularlyhaving in mind the fact that qualities of tyres have improved,and that last season abnormal wear arose through the prolongedhot dry weather.     As regards replacement for commercial vehicles an increa.seof 7 per cent, is shown in the licences, but in the class which represents vehicles up to one ton (which comprises 42 percent, of the total commercial vehicles) there is a decrease of-approximately 2 per cent.   Here again there are indications of a possible reduction in tyre consumption this year, althoughthe total licences at the peak period of 1929 compare favourably with the figure for 1928,     As regards the Hackney carriage there is an increase inthe total number of licences of approximately 3 per cent, butin the light classes (vehicles carrying four to fourteenpassengers) there is actually a decrease of 2,000 licences.The deplorable condition of the taxi-cab and hire business isnotorious,   m the larger car and vehicle classes there is anincrease, particularly in the touring charabancs, but theirmileage is precarious and not so regular as the smaller vehicles.The amalgamation of passenger fleets throughout the country hasresulted in an economy in the vehicles used.   The tyres used onthese larger vehicles have been greatly improved - giving anincrease in mileage of nearly 30 per cent.   Over all, therefore,It is not expected that there will be a greater consumption oftyres, although up-to-date figures have been good and much betterthan last year.     The market for solid tyres is rapidly declining.     Wholesalers and retailers were heavily stocked in the last quarter of 192 9,   Since that date stocks have been consistentlyreduced, due largely to Budget uncertainty.     The number of units per order indicates that the tradeis living from hand to mouth, and that stocks have not yetbeen reduced to normal proportions.     The Budget uncertainty encourages the consumer to wait forthe possibility of buying imported tyres, the surplus productionof foreign manufacturers at cut prices.     There is a general shortage of money, Easter falls latethis year, and all these facts taken together delay replacementtyre purchases.   The weather is an important factor in tyrelife.   The abnormally wet February reduced tyre wear considerablyand also car mileage.     Any influence tending to increase the cost of motoring,such as for instance petrol tax, must add to the adverseinfluence with which tyre manufacturers are now faced.
     In the export business in motor tyres the demand remains  Isteady.   The country has benefited as a result of  the estab-  1llshment of works in this country by certain foreign tyremanufacturers, some of their export tyre business having beentransferred to the British factories.  In sane countries the credit position makes trade very difficult, but, over all, it  \Is anticipated that export figures this year will approximatethose of last year.     Business Is poor in motor cycle tyres,-, both in firstequipment and replacement.     The demand for pedal cycle tyres at home and abroad Isstill very strong.   There has been an increase in  cycling,but cycle manufacturers are now met with a considerable reduction in export trade, due probably to the depressedstate of the rubber and other raw material markets.     In the general rubber goods business - mechanical yubbersfor textile manufacture, textile engineering, chemical and motor car trades - the demand has fallen off considerablyduring the last few months, particularly in Lancashire, theWest Riding of Yorkshire, and the artificial silk centres.There is, however, an increasing tendency to use rubber in place of other materials, for instance, rubber and  canvasbelting In place of leather in transmission and conveying work.The Increased use of rubber for motor car parts is  quitenoticeable and beneficial.     The ebonite branch of the trade Is very quiet.  Eboniteis being superseded in some directions by a variety ofcheaper compositions, particularly suitable for the wirelesstrade.  Ebonite battery boxes, used on cars and commercial vehicles, are being superseded by an article made of a cheapercompound.  The demand for ebonite In the chemical and textiletrades has fallen off considerably, due to the general tradedespression.     Trade &amp;n sports goods Is good, but intense competitionis present.   The tonnage over all, however, is comparatively small.     Home trade In play balls is very poor, owing to pricecompetition from Continental manufacturers.     In football bladders there is Increasing competition from the Continent, manufacturers there having improved theirproduct,     Trade in surgicals generally Is poor.   There has,however, been a great increase in tho use of hot water bottleswhich are classified under this heading, due mainly to thelower prices ruling from bigger production.  The demand hasbeen stimulated by the multiple and chain stores.  against this, however, a mild winter&quot; reduced the sales of the higherquality bottles.     The demand for rubber flooring is increasing both athome and abroad.   The advantages of this type of flooringare now being more genorally appreciated^ and the industryIB anticipating a period cf satisfactory trade In this line.As regards the general outlook In the Home market it is theexperience of our salesmen over the past few months that thereare very few manufacturers who are prepared to extend theirplant or to buy, except from hand to mouth.
     The demand for winter rubber footwear has been very small,due to mild winter conditions, and we have had very heavycompetition for what small business there has been.     The President of the Board of Trade at this point 1 eft     The MeeiTing and t*He &quot;Oliaxr was ifaken by Mr. GML cilxlett.                         MOTOR INDUSTRY.     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS:  Little change is noticeable inrespect of conditions in the motor industry, compared withMarch,   A certain seasonal increase is not up to the usualstandard at this time of the year.   While there are one ortwo exceptions in the case of new models, there can be noquestion that the business in new cars is less than at thecorresponding period  of last year.     Unemployment reached considerable dimensions in theMidlands area early in March, and there has been a very slightimprovement since.     Commercial vehicle output is fairly satisfactory, butthere are signs1&apos;of a slackening of enquiries for all types ofheavier vehicles in particular.     Exports for all types of vehicles appears fairly satisfactory, although Australia continues to be.a*source ofgreat anxiety.  Although the demand for British vehicles ismaintained, and shews an increase in comparison to .the total volume in that market as compared with last year, severalmanufacturers are contemplating the necessity of shutting down that market entirely, owing to the Impossibility of discourt-ing bills.  This point is a very serious one as regardsAustralia today.   It really means that manufacturers are sending goods to Australia and11 not getting any money back inreturn.   We send motor cars there, and the money stays therein Au stralian banks.     CHAIRMAN (Mr. Gillett):  I was informed that they had gotover that difficulty.  Do you mean that the difficulty has again sprung.up?     SIR WILLIAM MORRIS:  I think it still exists, and has done for some short time now.     CHAIRMAN:  I was given to understand that arrangements hadbeen made and the difficulty had been overcome.     SIR WILLIAM MuRRIS:  There are so few manufacturers who can stand sending goods out there and getting no money back.     CHilRMAN:  Can you get any motor cars in now on the newtariff?     SIR Y.ILLIAM MuRRIS:  We can get them in, but the point isthat we cannot get our money out.  We are not grumbling somuch about the tariff.  But the average manufacturer who isnot too well off finds it rather difficult to send such things as motor cars in quantities to Australia and. get nomoney in return.  Your money is in the bank  in Australia and you cannot move It.&quot;
      /B&quot;oth Sir George Beharrell and Mr.  Walmsley confirmed Sir William i.lorris&apos;s difficulty about getting money from- Australia^/      SIR ERNEST GLOVER:   The bank refuse to remit,  and to get a remittance there is a charge of 7ij per cent.      SIR WALTER RAINE:   I have this information from the Chambers of Commerce.   Various wool brokers have been buying these debts in Australia and fetching wool over here and paying here in full.   Have you got In touch with some of those?      SIR WILLIAM MORRIS:  That is an idea, certainly.      SIR &quot;WALTER RAINE:   We were told about a month ago at the Chamber of Commerce that it is being done very largely.  I pass on the information so as to help trading.      SIR WILLIAM IvlORRIS:  There has been again a reduction in the demand for foreign cars.   This may, t^ some extent, be due to the uncertainty about the McKenna Duty position.      Agents, generally speaking, report cancellation or postponement of orders  and enquiries for new cars. Considerable stocks of many types of cars undoubtedly exist in the agents&apos; hands, and there is much evidence of owners of old vehicles postponing any decision to purchase new vehicles in exchange pending an improvement in the general financial conditions.      It can, generally speaking, be said that the motor industry is experiencing what may well be inevitable, viz., a slackening in tho demand due to general depression and anxiety about the Budget in particular.                      CO-OPERATIVE TRADE.     MR. ARTHUR VARLSY:  As representing the Consumers in theCo-operative Movement, I want to say that the price of commodities generally during the month has been very stable.Compared with a year a^o the prices are down considerably.For instance, sugar compared with March 1929 is down 6.11$butter 10.65$ flour 6.86$ lard 14.32$ and tea, owing to the dropping of the tea duty, 13.89$.   Possibly because of thosereductions in prices there is an increased consumption on theedible side.   Though the price of goods has gone down so muchwe are still showing increases in cash receipts.   As far aswoollens, and ready-made boots and shoes, and furniture areconcerned, there is a considerable decrease, probably causedby the bad trade of the moment.   So far as the retail prices are concerned, they were practically at a standstill during themonth excepting butter, which has ^,one down about 2d. per lb.The stronger tendency in tea which was  evident at the close of last month was well maintained during the whole of thepresent month, and the market has been very active for alldescriptions.   The quality of Indian teas showed no improve-ment, but prices were very firm and frequently dearer in thecase of the medium and common descriptions.   Ceylon tea showed a decided improvement In quality and the market was very active,!
Smaller supplies and improved quality &quot;brought higher pricesbut the supply of really fine flavoury tea of improvedquality was readily welcomed by buyers.   Java and Sumatrateas were irre-ular mostly showing a decline in price.     One of the things that has dropped to a large extent is&amp;reen fruit and potatoes - if you do not mind iry classingpotatoes with fruit.   Potatoes have undergone a very big drop.In fact, there is scarcely any market value for them at themoment.   People simply get what they can for them.   The otherday there were potatoes at 35s.Od a ton delivered at thestation.   The railway rate was 15s.Id., so that all that was left for the farmer, for his carting to the station, for hisseed and labour and growth, was  1.   That shows the deplorablecondition in which potatoes are from the farmer&apos;s point ofview.   I am not sure that the consumer gets the whole of thatbenefit in reduced price, but at any rate he is getting someof it.   It is an interesting speculation as to whether theconsumer does get all he ought to get in the drop of prices.     So far as wheat is concerned, during the month the pricehas fluctuated within very narrow limits.   The exporting countries are holding firmly, but the consumptive demand ofEurope being small, advances are very difficult to maintain.The Farm Board of the United States appointed by the Senateoperate in all declines and try to support the market, but inthat they have not been quite as successful as they hoped tobe.   There is the possibility that Russia will bring, morewheat into this country during this year than they have doneduring the last season.   Twelve months ago no wheat was coming into this country from Russia.   At the moment thereis some slight quantity, about 2,000 tons coming in, and thereis likely to be a larger import of wheat from Russia than there has been latterly.   So far as Australia is concerned,large quantities are afloat unsold at the present moment, andif it will interest Sir tfilliam Morris I might say that sofar as we are concerned we are having to send a lot of moneyto Australia for the wheat that is coming from there, and forthe other things which we are importing from that country.During the past season the amount sent has not been less than about  3,000,000.   That is something towards paying for the motor cars.     So far as India is concerned, there is a normal yield ofwheat this year.   With regard to the Argentine, the old cropis still good, but the new wheat that is arriving is of poorerquality, and the offers are restricted.     Generally in the drapery and allied trades the positionis far from satisfactory, and there does not seem, any immediate cause for optimism or possible revival.   Accordingto the reports I have, the values of made up goods seem to beabout 7^ per cent, below what they  were twelve months ago,and the fashion goods, though they have been very smart intheir effects and designs, are bein&amp; made up of lower qualitymaterials at the moment.   Boots and shoes with us are finding a rather restricted demand;  in Lancashire andYorkshire particularly we are finding decreased sales.Furnishing is falling off, and there is a very considerabledecrease in the demand at the moment for furniture.
     Speaking of woollens, I think this might interest theAdvisory Council though it does not apply to last month.  we received a rather large order for serges recently from Russiawhich will cause two of our mills, the Buckfastleigh and Bradfordmills at any rate to work full time for two or three months from now.  The order is from the Co-operative Society of Russia.     MR, LINDSAY:  In regard to what Mr. Varley said as to indian tea, I understand that there is to be an effort to restrict the Northern crop to the finer kinds during 1930,which ought to mean an improvement,     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  May I aek what sort of terms of paymentyou have with Russia?  Is it long credit, or do they payprompt cash?     MR. VARLEY:  They vary according to the article and thegeneral conditions, but generally it is a case of round abouttwelve months&apos; bills,     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  You are a wealthy corporation.     MR. VARLEY:  I may say that we have never had an a pp.1 jcatlorfor an extension of a bill for a single day, and we arefinancing a lot of imports, as well as goods that we sell.     MR, BEN TURNER:  With regard to the decreased sales ofboots and shoes in Lancashire and Yorkshire, is that due to thecontinued bad trade there?     MR. VARLEY:  Yes,  Another rather significant factmentioned in the report is that the repairing trade is also in a,bad state,                 00-OPERATIVE TRADE IN SCOTLAND.     MR. J. CAIRNS:  During the past month, in fact, since thebeginning of the year, a feature of the distributive trade hasbeen a substantial fall In the prices of various staple articlesof food, such as sugar, butter, eggs, oatmeal, flour and. potatoes.While some of the decreases are owing to seasonal causes, as inthe case of butter and eggs, the remainder have to be explained in other ways.  The low prices of flour, oatmeal and potatoesare undoubtedly due to large stocks following very abundantcrops, but the fall is being aggravated by the decliningconsumption of these articles.  The causes of the decline arepopularly assigned to various agencies.  It is said that theconsumption of flour is being reduced by the shifting of thepublic taste from plain to fancy bread, and by the increasinguse of patent foods.  It is certainly the uniform experience ofCo-operative Societies that the sale of plain bread is flaggingwhile that of fancy bread is on the increase, and this involves a less percentage of flour in the weight of the article.     For the lessened consumption of oatmeal, the reason givenis that the change of industrial hours whereby the generalstarting time is delayed until 8 o&quot;clock, causing the workmanto have breakfast before he leaves the house in the morning, is
unfavourable to the use of oatmeal, which is an articletaking a comparatively long time in the cooking.  It is a fact that the sale of raw oatmeal is becoming less and less,while that of prepared oats is increasing, though the increasein the one case is very far from being as large as the decrease in the other.     The consumption of potatoes is regarded as not being as large as it would be if more attention were paid to qualityby the growers.  Those of us who have had considerable experience of the retail trade on a large scale know thedifficulty of maintaining a constant supply of potatoes ofgood quality, so few growers study the quality as well as thequantity of the cropj and too many are prone not to dreesthe potatoes thoroughly when the necessity for it can be avoided.  They never consider they are spoiling the market,and inducing a lower price in the end, which Is the case, aswhen customers find the quality to be inferior, and an excessive amount of waste in the potatoes, they buy fewer ofthem.     Apart from these particular causes, said to be affectingrespectively the consumption of the staple articles of foodthus mentioned, it is a common opinion that the general levelof prices is steadily falling and that the wide-spreaddepression of trade Is not unconnected with this movement.     As compared with the corresponding period of last year      Pine granulated sugar ie 2s.4%d.per cwt.lese in price.      Danish butter...........17s.0d.  &quot;   &quot;    &quot;   &quot;   &quot;      Hew Zealand butter......33s.0d.  &quot;   11    &quot;   &quot;   &quot;      Australian butter.......33s.Od.  &quot;   &quot;    w   &quot;   &quot;      Irish eggs.............. ls.0d. per hundred&quot;  &quot;   &quot;     The price of best eggs has touched a point approximateto that of the immediate pre-war rate.  It may be stated thatimporters expecting higher prices than those that have ruledsince the beginning of the year brought forward largequantities of Chinese eggs.  Prices have been entirely contraryto these expectations, and Chinese eggs are selling at 3s.6d.as against 13e.3d. last year, and muso be involving theimporters in considerable loss.     Each month since the beginning of the year, the priceof potatoes has become less.  Our average price for Januarywas 25s.0d. per ton; for February 16s.6d.j and for March14e.0d., f.o,r. Perthshire; while potatoes bought nearer thepoint of retail distribution were correspondingly higher in price.  A regrettable prospect is that the market willprobably not be able to take the whole of the potatoes onhand and that a considerable quantity will go to waste.  Itis a defect in the arrangeraent of things that concurrently with this waste of food, pigs for which potatoes are adaptedas feeding should be scarce on farms and pork very dear inthe market.     Home cheeses are expected to be at a lower level ofprices this year than last.  Since the institution of the&quot;Pool&quot; the supply of milk has been very plentiiul, and withthe flow of milk high at present, farmers and creameries aremaking cheese extensively.  Stocks in Canada are reported tobe about half what they were., last year, but to counterbalaxxcethis, substantial quantities will be available from SewZealand.
     Quite a number of minor articles of food nave reachedthe immediate pre-war level of prices.  Dutch marrowfat peasare 6s, per sack below it.  Lentils from the new crop, whichwill be available in June, are being offered at 3s. to 4s.per cwt, below present values, making prices for the new cropalmost on a level with those of pre-war.     Rices and tapiocas while not down so much in price arebeing quoted at substantially less than last year&apos;s prices forthe new crop.     Owing to the fall in values generally our sales areslightly less than those for the corresponding period of lastyear, but the quantities are greater.  This refers only tosales to our own members.    From time to time we have beensupplying the Russian Go-operative Wholesale Society with such goods as herring and Scotch tweed, and the other day we soldthem 10,000 tons of British refined sugar.  The bills for thepayment of that sugar have a less duration than twelve months.On the productive side trade in the various factories is moreor less up and down, the only one to be seriously affectedby the condition of the market is the jute factory, Dundee.here trade is very bad, and one of the reasons given for thedepression is that the Jute Mils Association, Calcutta, hasembarked on a policy of aggression against the unassociatedfirms in India and the European mills.  The works of theJute Mills Association have been running only four days weeklyfor some years, and now as an aggressive step they have beenput upon a five-day week.  This additional production comingupon over-stocked markets has aggravated the fall in prices and greatly helped to turn intoa collapse what was a merefluctuation.  Outside the broad influences affecting theentire industry our own mill has been adversely affected bysome local conditions.  For instance, the agriculturaldepression has weakened the demand for potato bags and forgrain and offal bags.  Further, a more drastic loss of work has been caused by the substitution of paper felt for jutecloth in the manufacture of floor cloth and linoleum.  Ourewn floor-cloth factory was able to give extensive orders tothe jute mill, and these have almost stopped.  These are the particulars connected with our own business.     MR. BEN TURNER:  How are your cloth mills at Selkirk, andso forth?     MR. CAIRNS:  Except for the Russian orders we should bevery quiet there.     CHAIRMAN:  How quickly do you pass the falling prices onto the members of your Society?     MR,CAIRNS: They get the advantage either in the form of larger dividends or lower prices.  If I may take the opportunityI might say that it is notorious the profit that is being taken on bread at the moment.  I used to be manager of the largestCo-operative Society then in the kingdom, and the margin weused to take between the price of flour and tae price of breadwas less than half what it Is now.  If you take it that the margin than was 15s,0d,, you will find that at the presentmoment they are taking 30s,Od,  Of course, there are various reasons for it, but it is nevertheless a fact.  Indeed, theother day I was at a meeting of store managers, and they alladmitted that profits in the retail trade are very much larger than they were in pre-war times.
                        AUSTRALIAN TRADE.     MR. JOHN SANDERSON:  The number of bales received intostore in Australia from the 1st July to the 23th February is2,352,694, and the number sold 1,452,879, and shipped for saleoversea 26,253.  The March, sales showed keen competition atimproved rates on the lower level.  The Continental buyers arethe principal operators.  It is the intention to offer the wholeseason&apos;s clip before the end of July with the object of avoiding any carry-over.  Wheat exports for this season are19,448,000 bushels compared with 43,090,000 last season.  the exports of flour this season are 137,700 tons compared with180,800 tons last season.     The bank clearances in all the capitals from the 1stJanuary to the 24th February last were  325,927,000 comparedwith  379,154,000 last year.  For Sydney and Melbourne fromthe 1st January to the 31st March the figures are  237,480,800and  198,503,300 respectively.  A Bill has been introduced in Federal Parliament to create a Central Reserve Bank.  Thefunctions, among others, are to control note issue; trade in commonwealth, State and British Government securities; toact as agent for issue and management of COimionwealth and state loans; to engage in overseas exchange; to make advances to other banks and to th9 Coimionwealth and State Governments;and to establish accounts with other Reserve Banks abroad.     With the object of adjusting the trade balance, theGovernment has imposed a 50 per cent, surtax upon certain imported goods and prohibited importation ox others except with consentof Minister of Customs.     In order to maintain a fortnightly service between Hobartand Sydney during the winter, the federal Government issubsidising Messrs. Huddart Parker to the extent of  10,000.Imports for eight months ended February were  96,635,700, exports 30,977,000, being decreases of  609,000 and  17,755,700respectively compared with previous year.  There was a very heavy drop in exports compared with the previous year.  TheCustoms revenue for March, viz.,  4,729,956 shows an increaseof  1,419,214 over last year due to heavy, bond-clearances in anticipation of increased Customs- duties.  For the nine months ended inarch, the Revenue was  34,376,334, showing an increaseof  3,121,450 over last year.  There is no doubt that th^rehas been and is a serious dislocation in the exchange due verylargely to the heavy fall in wool, and to the cessation of borrowing, but I think it will be admitted that however muchone may criticise the method adopted, very strenuous efforts are being made to rectify the position.  It is obvious thata dislocation such as is indicated in these figures showingthe heavy fall in exports cannot be put right in a very shortspace of time, and whatever inconvenience attaches to thetransfer of moneys for private firms is obviously inevitablettnder present conditions.  Every effort is being made to put itstraight, however, and I was very glad indeed to hear that verylarge sums ox&apos; money are going to Australia for wheat.  If thatcontinues, and the wheat area is increased, and the wool productsalso get large increases in money, and also the other products,.the position will oe all the sooner rectified.
     CHAIRMAN:  Is your hocvy fall in exports in valuo alone,  oris it also in the amount of goods being exported?     MR. SANDERSON:  That applies in different ways.  Forinstance, in wool there is very little diminution in the volume,but the value is roughly 40 to 50 per cent, below last year.  Wehave heard of the minor items like butter, for instance, showinga heavy fall, and mining products snd nearly all products have suffered.     OHAIRKAN.  What is the point in having another central bank?I always looked on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia as takingthe place of such a bank.     MR. SANDERSON:  The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was originally established by the Government in pre-war days - Ithink in 1910, - with the object of financing certain businesses.It was an additional trading bank.  When the War came- theGovernment moneys were passed through the Commonwealth Bank, andit became in that way rather distinct fro-n the ordinary tradingbanks, and since the War it has occupied a separate position andhas to a very large extent ceased  from trading in opposition tothe trading banks although ther9 is sos?.e criticism about thatstill being done.  It has become a sort of mixture between atrading bank and a central bank.  Now the position has arisenwhen they are separating the two.     CHAIRMAN:  The Commonwealth Bank will become a regulartrading bank again, being quite free.     MR. SANDERSON:  Well, it is not quite certain yet what itwill become, but the intention is to separate the two functions,making a separate central bank for the ordinary purposes of a central bank, and the functions of the Commonwealth Bank as atrading bank are still to be defined.     MR. RIDLEY WARHAM:  Oan iir. Sanderson tell us anything at allabout the position with regard to the coal stoppage in Australia?     MR. SANDERSON:  The latest information about that is that nothing has been possible to avoid a deadlock.  It is a great disappointment to everybody.  They are still not working in thestrike area.                              OPAL.     MR. GEORGE A. MITCHELL:  In reporting for Scotland, I canconfirm what Mr. Ridley -/arham and Sir Walter Raine have said about the coal trade.  The position of the coal trade inScotland has been getting steadily worse.  There has bean aconsiderable amount of idle time.  There has been a serious fallin the price of coal for shipment, and especially in allclasses of nut coal both for home and for export.  The prices in some cases are lower than the pre-war prices.  Some classes are practically unsaleable for export owing to the heavystooks at foreign ports.  The capacity for output has unfortunate-ly increased, the number employed in the week to the 38nd jiiarchbeing 102,000 as compared with about 100,000 at the beginning
3 QJ*sof the year.  The output for the week to  the  22nd  March was699,200 tons as compared with 734,800 tons  in the  week tothe 1st February.    Even in February there was  some  idletime.   There is no sign of any improvement.   We  inScotland are also suffering from the subsidy  which has beengranted in Yorkshire, the Yorkshire coals competing to alarge extent with the better class of coals in the East ofScotland,                        IRON AND STEEL.     With regard to the iron and steel trade,  the steelworks have on the whole been fairly well employed,  but  orders are falling off, and there has been idle time  at  several  works.The outlook is unsatisfactory, and the prospects  for&apos; chip-building are not good.    The scrap position continuea  easy,and the price is about the same as last month. The importsof scrap into Scotland in February were again  considerable,including 8,000 tons coming from the Argentine.   I  notice that for the first time for a very long period the  exportsof scrap from the country have been considerably^  exceeded bythe imports.  There is one rather curious feature,  and  thatis that there has been actually, I notice, an  import from poland,  Poland has been a very large buyer of scrap from theSouth Ooast, but there has been an import from Poland of  603tons into Scotland in February.   I do not know definitely, butI believe it may be due to the fact that Poland has madepurchases in scrap and is taking against contract and sellingsome of those purchases into this country.  Generally thescrap position is very much easier than it was.     Some of the constructional works are still fairly  busy,but I understand there is an absence of enquiries for workof any large size.  There is no great change in the outputof pig iron, but the price for basic iron in Scotland is  quitenon-competitive with imported iron.   In February 4,758 tonBof basic pig iron were imported from India, and very largequantities have been ordered for delivery during  the rest ofthe year.  The figure for March, I understand, will be  larger  *than for February.   In foundry pig iron 6,528 tons wereimported fro:1 Belgium, France and India.  Imports of steelcontinue heavy, the total for February being over 51,000  tons,practically the same as in January.     In the tube trade some branches are working  fairlywell, but in others there has been much idle time.    Oneworks is entirely closed this week.     The position in Australia has very seriously affectedbusiness in the tube and other trades.    Orders  are much reduced, and the increasing cost for remittances  is makingbusiness difficult.   I would like to emphasise what has  been said already about the position in Australia.     The rate forremittances is now up to about 7-1- per cent.   It  is a veryserious matter for those doing a large trade in Australia.Undoubtedly Australia will eventually pay, but, of  course,that does not give any relief for the contracts which must be executed..  Unfortunately in many cases the freight  oo^es  intothe question, and people are- losing the cost of freight aswell as the cost of the goods.
     MR. WALMS LEY:  I should like to ask whether that import of scrap from   Poland was heavy melting scrap.     MR. MITCHELL:  It must have been melting scrap fromthe price.   The export to Poland from the Scuth Coast for february was 3,245 tons, and the import into Scotland was 603 tons.   The actual imports of scrap Into thecountry in February were 21,319 tons as against 16,893tons export.   It is fair to say that this consignment of scrap from the Argentine of over 6,000 tons is an exceptional shipment, but still it is rather remarkablethat with the position reversed from what it was some considerable time ago,-viz., that there is more comingInto the country than is going out,  - it does not causegreat alarm.                   SCOTTISH TEXTILE TRADE.     The textile trade In Scotland is not very satisfactory.There is one Glasgow works which is entirely  closed down.It is a works that has been in existence for  very many years,and which used to employ about 500 to 700 workers.   Thereason given is that it is now impossible to  do business with America, where a large part of the output was formerlysent.     During the past few years a good many works connectedwith the manufacture of muslin have closed down in Glasgow.                ENGINEERING AMD SHIPBUILDING.     MR. J.R. RID HMO 3D:  Marine engineering  continues  in which the same position as during the last two months,  andthere are few outstanding features to report.   There  isa general scarcity of new contracts, particularly  forvessels of the Liner and Cargo Liner type, but during  thepast month both the North East Coast and the Clyde have secured a fair proportion of the motor tanker tonnagerecently placed.   On the Clyde during the month 16 vessels were launched and are now completing, as against only  ninenew contracts received, and, with the exception of the longexpected Cunarder, and the vessel of the Union SteamshipCompany of New Zealand, there appear to be few large vessels to lay down.   Reports from Greenock and the lower reachesare better, and engineering establishments there are allfairly well employed.   In Aberdeen, although the work  ismostly small, there is considerable activity in trawlers and like vessels and their equipment.     On the North East Coast low freights and the  amount oftonnage laid up are blamed for the lack of enquiries for ordinary cargo ships, but the amount of work in hand up till.now has been sufficient to maintain a fair average ofemployment.   The marine engineering establishments are now beginning to get short of work,     In Belfast both the leading firms are busy, and theamount of repair work is also very satis factory.  AltogetherNorthern Ireland constitutes the brightest area at toe moment.The tenders for Admiralty worn; in prospect have just beenissued and cover propelling machinery for a  light Cruiser tobe constructed at Devonport, also for a Flotilla Leader, two destroyers and two sets of machinery for Destroyers to be built at Portsmouth Dockyard, and that work will be verywelcome to other districts.
      In  connection with naval work,  it  is somewhatdisconcerting to  find that  orders have  just been placedin  Italy for two Turkish Destroyers, a Destroyer forVenezuela, and  one for the  Greek Government notwithstanding that  we  maintain a Naval Commission  in Athens.   The Italianswill  naturally  say that they have succeeded in  obtaining theorder in spite  of the fact  that there is a British NavalCommission in Greece, and some people point to  that as aproof of the superiority in the Italian designs, and thatis  not calculated to enhance our reputation as  engineers and shipbuilders abroad.    I understand these orders were obtained without any enquiries being sent out to Britishengineers and shipbuilders  in this country.   I do not knowwhether  you have any means  of obtaining information as tothe circumstances of those  orders, but  I think  it mightwell  repay investigation.     Then with  regard to the wages position, that is stillin  abeyance.    At a conference between the employers and representatives of the trade unions held on 26th February,1950, the employers suggested that a small committee from both  sides be set up to investigate the wages,  working conditions, and costs of production in  competitive countries.     Following  upon an adjournment, the unions  intimated that  they would arrange for a further conference of thetrade unions with a view to their considering the employers&apos;suggestion.   The trade unions have since met and have declined the employers&apos; suggestion, and they, propose toproceed  with their request  to the Government to set up aCommission to enquire into  the state of the engineering industry, on the lines of the present investigation in thecotton and iron and steel industries.     SIR EDWARD CROWE:  As  regards the construction ofthese foreign warships, I cannot understand how it is thatour people did  not get enquiries, because nearly all thesefirms have men  actively looking out  for orders  both inTurkey and in Greece, and our Legation has been very activethere too.   Are you sure that those orders were placedin  Italy without our people getting a chance of tendering?      Ml. RIO HMOHD:  My authority is one of the  firms that have  specialised on Destroyer work.      SIR WALTER RAINE:  The fact of the matter  is we hadthe definite statement given to us on a Committee of whichI am  a member that the orders were offered to this country,and the  gentleman giving that statement was connected with one of the firms.   What happened was that they thoughtthat  they had got the orders, and everything was arranged,and then&apos; Mr. Mussolini stepped in at the last moment and offered  credit  such as was  quite impossible for this firmto give.   The  order was for considerably over   1,000,000.This  firm could not even find out how much credit was given,but it was very long credit, and that was the reason theorders were lost.     0 HAIR MAE:  Do you know whether the credit  terms givenin this  way are such that it would be c^uite impossible in  a  normal way for the banking system  of a country like this  to  have given them?
     SIR WALTER RAINE:  We were told quite definitely thatit was impossible.   They had tried their bankers.   It isa firm which could easily get  1,000,000.     CHAIRMAN: . It really came to a Government subsidy.     SIR WALTER RAINE:  It was a Government subsidy - thatis the way to put it.     MR. HAMILTON:  Do you mean a cash subsidy, or was it inthe way of export credit?     SIR WALTER RAINE:  It was an equivalent of export creditThere was no cash.   It was guaranteeing the Italian hismoney.   He would be able to get Turkish bills andVenezuelan bills and discount them, the same as one could with the bills which are given with the credit of this government.     MR. HAMILTON:  We have an Export Credits Departmentwhich should have been able to step into the breach.     SIR EDWARD CROWE:  We cannot touch munitions of war.We are not allowed to do that.                      COLONIAL TRADE.     Ml. R.V. VERNON:  I have nothing very much to reportexcept to give a few figures for the full&quot; year 1929.  kenya and Uganda show a very substantial increase of total exports.In 1929 they reached  7,020,664 compared with  6,661,673in 1928.   There is a substantial increase of cotton fromUganda, from 553,944 centals in 1928 to 816,229 centalsin 1929.   In 1929 the value of the home consumption importsof Kenya and Uganda was  8,607,910 as compared with 8,696,061 in 1928.   The percentage of imports from theUnited Kingdom in 1929 was the same as in 1928, viz.,40 per cent.     The value of domestic exports from Tanganyika Territoryduring 1929 was  3,722,829 as compared with  3,873,523 in1928.   Cotton, which is one of the principal items in theseexports, shows a very slight increase.   There were 110,821centals exported in 1929 as compared with 109,608 centalsin 1928.   There is a big increase in the total importsof Tanganyika Territory for home consumption, those for1929 being  4,285,952 as compared with  3,737,358 in 1928,an increase of over  500,000.   There is a slight decreasein the percentage of Imports from the United King.com, thepercentage in 1929 being 34 per cent, as compared with36 per cent, in 1928.     With regard to the Gold Coast, the value of the gold coast export trade in 1929 was  12,419,694 as compared with 13,620,443 in 1928.   I think that decrease is mainly dueto the fall in price of cocoa.   The percentage of exportsto the United Kingdom in 1929 was 29 per cent, as comparedwith 30 per cent, in 1928.   The import trade is very substantially reduced, being  9,207,127 in 1929 as comparedwith  11,452,644 in 1928, and there Is a fall in thepercentage of imports from the United Kingdom from 54 percent. In 1928 to 47  per cent, in 1929.
     With regard to Nigeria, the total export  trade  was nearly 18,000,000 in 1929 as compared with a little  over 17,000,000 in 1928.     The import trade shows a reduction^&quot;being  13,106,175 in 1929 as compared with  16,334,624 in 1928,The percentage of imports from the United Kingdom also shows  areduotion, although the percentage is very highj  being 70 percent, in 1929 as compared with 73 per cent, in 1928.     Sierra Leone shows a decrease of exports  from 1,829,093 irt 1928 to  1,532,237 in 1929.   The total valueOf imports during 1929 was  1,789,053 as compared with 2,054,507 in 1928.     The export of rubber from British Malaya  in February 1930is estimated at 48,947 tons as compared with 52,535  tons  in theprevious month of January.    The output of tin and  tin in ore from the Federated Malay States during February 1930, was,768 tons.    This is a reduotion from 4,896  tons in February1929.     The only other thing which affects the Colonies at themoment, is the sugar position which is causing  very great anxiety in the West Indies and Mauritius in both of  whichplaces sugar cannot be produced at the present time  except at a substantial loss.   In bpth those areas there is verygreat anxiety with regard to the Budget,                           EMPLOYMENT.     MR. T.W, PHILLIPS:  There was a further increase in theunemployment figures in Maroh amounting to 138,000,  bringing  thetotal up to the vory high figure of 1,677,000.  About half  theincrease was in the &quot;wholly unemployed&quot; group and was all dueto the changes in the unemployment benefit rules made by therecent Actj  half the increase, therefore, did not represent&amp; real inorease in unemployment.  The balance of 70,000  wasin the &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; group, a great part of  it inootton.     In London and the South of England generally there  wasa net decrease in the figures, which of course meant a largerreal improvement in view of the effect  of the new Act, butmuch of this improvement would be seasonal.  There werereal increases probably in the rest of  the oountry,  the  mostmarked being in Lancashire,     I will hand in the usual table of  the numbers of insuredpersons employed-^.     MR, BEN TURNER:  Is the inorease in Lancashire  amongst menor women?     MR. PHILLIPS?  It is in both men and women.  Compared  withother trades there is a larger number of women than  wouldusually be the case.     CHAIRMAN:  Do you get a corresponding fall in the figuresfor relief from the Guardians?*See Appendix p.; 4a
     MR. PHILLIPS:  There has been a fall,  but  it  has to beremembered that certainly the majority of the persons on theGuardians1 books who may be drawing outdoor relief are  already on the Registers.  They may be ceasing to draw  outdoor  relief, butthat does not mean an increase to the same extent  on the live register.                             SHIPPING.     SIR ERNEST GLOVER:  With regard to the shipping trade,  regret to say there is no improvement.   The index number offreights for March is 18.15 against 18.95 for February which wasthe lowest since 1980, i.e,, taking the 1920 basis as 100*.  Thisshows a reduction in the rate from February to March of about -J per cent.  The amount of tonnage laid up has increased very considerably.   It is difficult to give an exact figure assteamers are laid up in so many different ports.   The latest estimate of the Chamber of Shipping is  that there are 584vessels of approximately 3,400,000 tons deadweight capacitylaid up in principal ports of Great Britain and Ireland andthis number includes 12 new ships of 160,000 tons deadweight.This figure of 3,400,000 tons is against the figure of 820,000tons as estimated on the 1st January.   The figure given by  ashipping paper which has been collecting statistics shows thatincluding foreign ships there are 738 vessels of approximately4,100,000 tons deadweight laid up.   The American figures,which are official, as at the end of the year give 303 privately owned ships, and 328 Shipping Boa-&apos;d ships laid up - aggregatingapproximately 5,000,000 tons deadweight capacity.     The paucity of business in other directions is somewhatsurprising..   Tonnage is offering for employment in Australia,but beyond an occasional cargo of ore for America and a rarecargo of wheat for Europe- there is nothing to be done, althoughthe wheat would be. carried much below the cost of carriage.Conditions in the East generally are the same.    There is nothing doing in India except a few cargoes of coal coastwise,and nothing doing from Burmah for rice.   From the Argentinethere has been a little more enquiry, ^nd rates have advanceda shade over the lowest point touched but remain far belowcost.  We heard from Sir Walter Raino of coasting steamerslosing  50 to  100,    In these round trades the losses aresomething between  1,000 and  2,000 on a voyage.   The overseastrade is much more badly hit than the coasting trade.  Hopesare entertained that on the opening of  navigation wheat maybe shipped from Canada, but so far there is&quot;no demand andshipments will depend upon the willingness of the Canadian Poolto sell and the disposition or capacity of Europe to buy. this applies also to the United States who are supposed to beholding large stocks of wheat for higher prices.    There hasbeen a little chartering from Cuba for  sugar, all at very lowrates.    We are also hoping that the opening of the Balticseason will absorb some of the laid up  tonnage for the carriage of timber.    The Russians have taken a considerable block oftonnage for the White Sea.*0n the 1913 basis as 100 the indexes are 77.56  for  Maroh,  1930,     and 80.98 for February,  1930.
2 9 7in pig-iron at the moment.   You have heard of certain ship-ments of Indian pig-iron into Scotland.   India has reliedvery lar0ely on Japan as an outlet for surplus pig-iron.  I&quot;believe the total amount of pig-iron sent to Japan from Indialast year was about 400,000 tons odd.   The Japanese marketis dryin0 up very seriously, and the result is that our Indianfriends are turning to this country to try and place some ofthe tonnage that ought normally to have gone to Japan.   Thatis what happens all round the world.   As soon as another ironor steel-producing country finds demand. fallin0 off, they say,&quot;Send some more into Great Britain;  it is the easiest place to send it tou&quot;   That is our position, and I must sayfrankly., gentlemen, the outlook for the steel trade in thiscountry is becoming appallingly serious.                        INDIAN TRADE.     MR. H.A.P. LINDSAY:  Our  agricultural year  ends on the31st March, and so does our financial year, and I think I might perhaps give a very brief account of what our crop position hasbeen durin6 the past year.   Stated in percentages of the forecasts  of the year before, our staple crops are practicallyup to normal, that is to say, they are if anything slightlybelow;  for rice, jute, cotton, sugarcane, indigo., and wheat,the percentages would be on the average 98 or 99 per cent ofthe previous year.   The only crops which have really shown amarked decline on the year are oilseeds.   I have the detailsfor those, but I will not trouble the Council with them nowbut will put in a statement.*   The slump in prices seems toshow some  signs of coming to an end.   I may say as far as india is concerned we have suffered very considerably duringthe past few months.   I have just made out a statement of the months from which our staple products began to show a decline of prices  on the Indian market.   It was actually earlySeptember  last year for oilseeds and jute, and early october last year  for cotton, rice and wheat, and if you work out a graph of how that slump proceeded during the remainder of theyear and early this year you find that It steepens as it goes on.   That is to say, it begins fairly level, and then itfalls very sharply indeed in January and February.   I havenot got the March figures in front of me, but as I say thereis some indication of a recovery during the past fortnight.Now it is  a very curious thin0 that in spite of that slump inprices our balance of trade is on the whole fairly well maintained.   I suppose one reason is that cotton textilesconstitute a high proportion of our Imports, and prices ofcotton textiles respond at once to any fall in the price ofraw material, so that what m lose in our export of raw cottonin credits we gain in lower debits for the cotton textileswhich we import.   I think that must be one of the reasons why in spite of the slump in prices, in spite of the fact thatwe went over on balance from a wheat exporting to a wheatimporting  country, and in spite of other adverse factors, our balance of trade is still in our favour to an extent whichdoes not show appreciable diminution over past years.   Yetcuriously  enough in spite of the maintenance of our paperbalance of trade exchange is distinctly weak.   Thequotation  today would be about ls.5 l.d. against ls.6d. par.In pre-war days the official remittances from India balancedpretty regularly against the unofficial private demand forrupees.    You had one on  side the Government demand for&amp;  See Appendix p.39.
sterling remittances, and on the other side the trade demandfor rupee remittances.   Those two roughly balanced at about 25,000,000 sterling.     ftow-a-days export bills are not showing up in the way they did in the old days in spite of the fact that there is a paper balance, as I have said, in favour of India.   The only way we can explain that is that owin^ to the general industrialdepression the amount of private capital beinu invested in industrials in India has very much fallen off.   Pre-^ar,private claims for repayment of capital and claims for paymentof interest from India used to be set off against furtherinvestments in India.   The investment field was so great inIndia for tea and coal and jute mills and so on, that interestclaims were, so to speak, not discharged In this country at allbut were turned over in further investments in India.   That,however, is now coming to an end, and as far as we can seethe failure to reinvest in India is not due to any sort ofpolitical troubles out there but merely to the fact that india is sharing the industrial depression which is so prevalentthroughout the rest of the world today.    In other words, werebard this disappearance, so to speak, of the export bill asa temporary factor which will go as soon as India againbecomes a good market for industrials.     I am afraid it is a fact, with all deference to Dundee,that our jute mills have &amp;one up to five days, but I do notthink it can be described as a very grave aggression when we advance from four days to five days a week.   Our pig-ironexports to this country are increasing, but of course you mustnot expect me to take quite the same point of view in regardto those exports as the previous speaker.   I am also glad tobe able to report that the exports of Indian cotton, andespecially deliveries to Lancashire spinners, have very much increased during the  current season.   We have now passedabout three-fifths or four-fifths of the season, and I notice the deliveries of Indian cotton to Lancashire spinners fouryears ago were about 50,000 bales for that period, and duringthe same period up to date of the current seasrn the deliveries are now 150,000.   Of course that is very largely a matter of the margin between Indian and American prices.     Before I conclude may I say how much we are indebted tothe Empire Marketing Board for the assistance given to usin this country in several directions, and particularly in marketing our food stuffs.   At our suggestion the empire marketing Board undertook two years ago a survey of  Indianground nuts as marketed in this country with a view to showingthe fr-ee fatty acid contents, the percentage of which indicateswhether our 6round nuts are only available for soap manufactureor are available for margarine manufacture.   That is a point which I know will appeal to Mr. Varley.   The Empire MarketingBoard&apos;s survey showed exactly where our weak points were inthe export ports in India, and therefore where the areas werein which  m had to try and reform methods of preparation forthis market;  and I am 0lad to be able to report that an expertwitness before the Imperial Economic Committee last month saidthat, as a result of  that survey made by the Empire MarketingBoard and the steps taken to bring it to the notice of producers in India, the quality of the Indian ground nut had very much improved, and that the free fatty acid contents had gone down as the result of better methods of preparation.                                                                 Ill
     The second natter on which I wish to express my thanks tothe Empire Marketing Board is in regard to the Glasgow shop,I went there last week and found we were doing very well,    Wework in with the local retailers, selling samples of pureIndian products which the public can follow up in their purchases from local grocers,   We sell at the same priceas the local retail -prices, and the popularity of the shopis undoubtedly very great and is arousing very great interest.We started very well on the first day with takings of  21  forthe day, which is very good considering that the samples are sold in 2d. or 3d. packets, and only one to each customer.Saturday broke all records, the takings being nearly 350.That must have some effect, I think, on the local demand for indian products.                              WOOL.     MR. DOUGLAS HAMILTON:  My report on the wool textile trade will be pretty much on the same lines as it has been the lastmonth or two.   The price of raw material, after the tremendousslump there has beenj seems to have come to a stop, and itis fairly stable now, with the result that there has been more active buying in all the markets of the world.   Wool which hasbeen put up for auction has been sold practically in itsentirety, which has not been the case for a considerable time.The improvement has already affected the primary operations in the textile trade, namely the wool-sorting and combing,which are slightly better than they have been recently, but so far there has been no improvement in the spinning or theweaving.   There are one or two exceptions to that, namely the Yeadon and Guiselejr district where there has been asatisfactory demand.   They seem to have struck the rightmaterials, and they are fairly busy.   I will hand in areport * on the various wool textile centres in the West Riding. :I must make oust one comment on the very serious position that the textile trade is faced with at the present moment.The industry stands on the brink of a crisis due to the factthat the employers have posted notices to take effect thisweek of wage reductions based on the Macmillan Report.   TheTrade Unions have made counter-proposals which have been rejected by the employers, and unless a settlement is reachedimmediately a general strike affecting practically the whole industry is due to break out this week,     CHAIRMAN:  Mr, Hamilton, why has there been this great fallin wool?   Does it not reflect itself in the commodities thatare sold to the ordinary person in the retail trade?   perhaps i ought to ask you how far the fall has reflected itself inthe -retail price?     ICR. HAMILTON:  It hac reflected itself apparently veryslightly.   The cost cf a suit of clothes for a man, or a dressfor a woman, is almost unchanged.   It will, I suppose, at somedistant date reflect itself in the price of clothing, but so farI am sorry to say as consumers we get very little benefit by this fall in prices.     CHAIRMAN:  Is not the fall big enough-really to. allow of the retail purchaser benefiting?*See Appendix p. 44
    MR. HAMILTON:  I think it ought to be.    The great bulk ofthe cost is in labour.   The actual cost of wool in a suit  ofclothes is very small,   It would amount to a few shillings ina suit.   But the cost of a suit ought certainly to be reduced,shall we say, by a guinea, though it is not done yet,     CHAIRMAN:  Would it not have been to the interests of  thepeople who make clothes to have reduced the price so as to  haveincreased the consumption probably?     MR. HAMILTON:  Apparently the retailer seems to be able toget what.price he cares to put on the materials he is selling,I think it was Mr, Varley, or perhapa his colleague from scotland, who pointed out that the retailer seems to be getting a bigger profit today than he ever has done before.   It seemsto be a bottle neck somehow,     CHAIRMAN:  I was rather interested in what Mr, Varley  said about the sale of food.   He said that where you had&apos; a heavyfall in the price of food it was noticed that the consumption was going up.   That seamed to be the only thing in any of  ourreports today where you could say that the effect of thefall in prices seemed to be an increasing consumption because,I suppose, to a certain extent the benefit was being passed on.   In the case he referred to It had already been passed on to the consumer and was resulting in increased demand,     MR. LINDSAY:  Is it not possible that part at least of theincreased profits are going in additional publicity andadvertisement and better conditions of display.   Would not that have some effect on consumption apart from falling prices?     MR. BEN TURNER:  With regard to the labour costs youmentioned, Mr, Hamilton, that was of course after the clothleft the mill.   Are not the labour costs in a yard of cloth,for worsteds about 19 per cent, and for wools about 28 per  cent?     MR. HAMILTON:  I have-not the figures here, Mr, Turner,but I was referring to the labour costs right through from  thowool-washing to the retail suit,     MR, BEN TURNER:  There is a big gap between the time of leaving the mill and the suit,     MR, HAMILTON:  Yes.  At every stage of the manufacture of wool the profits seems to go up by leap3 and bounds,     SIR WALTER RAINE:  Could Mr, Hamilton tell us on whatsuit-price he suggests there should be a reduction of oneguinea, because there are all kinds of suits at all kinds ofprices, from the &quot;reach-me-down&quot; to the 15 guinea suit,     MR. HAMILTON:  I am talking about suits worn by peoplelike ourselves, A ten guinea  suit ought to be nine guineas.     MR. BEN TURNER:  There- ought to be no ten guinea suits.It is absolutely absurd to pay ten guineas for a suit withthe price of cloth as it is.   I am wearing a suit thatcost  2,17.6, which was made to measure at Batley as a littleexperiment.   It is not as good, as a ten guinea suit, I willadmit, but this suit would be five guineas in a shop.
                           CHEMICALS.      MR, HILL;  The conditions in the chemical industry show little change and do not appear likely to improve under the present industrial depression.   The heavy chemical industry rather depends on other trades, and wo have a serious slump in artificial silk which affects the demand for the chemicals Which they consume.   The acid trade is hit by the depression in the galvanizing industry, and the dyestuffs section, although making good technical progress is affected by lack of demand from the textile industries and so on.      While the home trade may be regarded as below reasonable expectations, it is encouraging that the total exports for chemicals, drugs, dyes and colours for the first two months of this year are slightly in advance of those for the same period in 1928 and 1929,   Imports in the same period have shown an appreciable drop as compared with the past two years,      I have today my periodical report on sulphuric acid, the consumption of which has for long boon regarded as a rough index of tho general Industrial activity of the country.   The report is on the same lines as usual, but rather more full, and I would like to bring it In full before the President of the Board of Trade.   1 would therefore propose to hand it in,* summarising It in a few words now In order- to save the time of the Council,   If I were to summarise it in one word it would be &quot;over-production&quot;.   Such industries as artificial silk, sulphate of ammonia, superphosphates, margarine manufacture, and oil refining, all of which are large users of sulphuric acid, have themselves been afflicted with over^- production, and consequently the demand for sulphuric acid falls off.   Reports from Spain, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany indicate that on the Continent the slump is, if anything, more severe than in this country.      Still with your permission summarising briefly the report, I might say on tho question of standardisation there has been a suggestion mado for a chemical standardising body to be set up In this country which would do for chemistry what the British Engineering Standards Association is doing for engineering. My Association is taking up that matter, and we hope to have the sympathy of the various Government Departments concerned.      With regard to the Poisons and Pharmacy Acts, there has been a report of the Departmental Committee which has considerable beax-ing on the activities of several sections of the chemical industry, and that matter is being carefully considered.      Finally I would like to make a brief reference to tho fine chemical industry in regard to which I have had very little to say for many months before this Council.   Taking a review over a period of years rather than months, it can be said that the- fine chemical industry has made and is still making definite and important progress.   I would refer especially to the* Sec Appendix p, 34.
****production of new substances for tho treatment and remedy of human ills, particularly in the field of what is calledchemotherapy, and in the equally important field of biochemistry.I have in mind such well known examples as insulin for thetreatment of diabetes, liver extract for pernicious anaemia,remedies for asthma, influenza, bismuth preparations for thetreatment of tropical diseases the manufacture of which has been undertaken by a few fine chemical manufacturers, at the instanceof the Medical Research Council working in conjunction with theColonial Medical Research Committee&quot;.   Particular referencemust be made to the vitamin preparations, in the productionof which this country has led the world,   It would beinteresting to the President to know that the latest scientificdiscoveries are commercially available- for the cure of disease and the improvement and maintenance of health, and that in thatfield the fine chemical industry in this country Is occupying the foremost position in the world.                             C CTT ON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART:  On the cotton trade for February Igavo a very gloomy report, and in the second week of March American \cotton dropped to its lowest point.   It was quoted for middlingin Liverpool at 7,88d, per lb.   Since that date there hasbeen a steady recovery in the price of cotton, and followingthis there has been a recovery in business.   Yarn sales roseweek by week during March, and the salos for the last week ofMarch were fully 50% more than at the beginning of the month.The total bulk of sales was not very good, but it was certainlybetter than it has been for some time.   Enquiries from abroadhave been numerous, and as the month proceeded a steady streamof orders began to be put through in cloth.   Now that theIndian Tariff has been settled, there is a fair demand forthis market,   Egypt has ordered a few bleaching cloths, SouthAmerica has become more promising, but the Far East is still very quiet, i,e, China, the Straits, and so on.   negotiations are still proceeding in Burnley with respect to the questionof eight looms to a weaver, which has caused a lot of interestthere.   As far as the progress of the Lancashire CottonCorporation is concerned, contracts for about 5,000,000 spindleshave been signed, and negotiations are going on for about ,000,000 further spindles.   In reference to the increase intho orders for yarns, which is the primary stage of cloth, Ithink during March it has hardly had time to have any greateffect on the unemployment figures yet, because they are in thestate of orders at present and the effect on unemployment will onlyappear when those orders are called for delivery,   But of course it will begin to have a considerable effect during this monthof April,     CHAIRMAN:  It is very satisfactory to have a more cheerfulreport,     SIR KENNETH STEWART:  As you see when the prices are attheir lowest that is the time when business is most depressed.It Is rather remarkable really, but it is so.   As a matter of fact during February week after week as the price was goingdown orders got fewer and fewer, and then week after week asthe price of cotton goes up the-&apos;orders proceed to get much better.   Though people are having to pay more for their goodsthan during February, they seem to take a much more cheerfulview of the circumstances.
                          MONEY MARKET.     LORD BRADBURY:  The month opened with an ineffective 4^%bank rate, reduced on the 6th to 4-$ which in its turn rapidlybecame ineffective and was followed by a Sg-j? bank rate a&quot;fortnight later.  The bill rate had fallen precipitatelyalmostto 2$ and a further reduction in bank rate to Z% has beenc?gafidently expected.     S* far this has not happened and there has lately been a recovery in bill rates that suggests that a lower bank rate isno longer regarded as such a strong probability..  This week&apos;sTreasury Bills had to be allotted as high as 2 ylSii and thetendency of bill rates still seems to be a rising one.,.   The3g-$ bank rate is therefore much less ineffective an officialrate than its predecessors and the fall in interest rates has for the time being at least been checked.     The reasons for this are evidently a considerable increasein the commercial bills coming to London for discount, a naturalresult of the lower rates here,  and also some suspicion of a renewal of Stock Zxchange speculation in New York.  There aretwo opinions as to whether this  is to be taken seriously or not.Perhaps a rise in securities there cannot be. maintained but     MR BEN TURNER:  Is the new Vickers-Clayford loom going well?     SIR KENNETH STEWART:  It is still being tried out, but it suffers from the defect in this country of all automatic looms, namely that the first cost is very high compared with the first cost cf the ordinary Lancashire loom.  With the number of hours that it can be worked per week you have such heavy overhead oharges compared to the ordinary Lancashire loom that the saving in wages and the saving in labour is overwhelmed always by the fixed charges that one has to pay on the increased cost.  That is the real trouble with regard to all automatic looms.     MR. BEN TURNER:  You can weave an imperfect yarn in your Lancashire loom, but you cannot with the automatic one-?     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   With the automatic loora you have to use a good deal more perfect yarn.  You have to pay more- for your yarn than you put into it.  That is compensated for where there are two shifts working because of course you can run 40 with one weaver instead of about 4.     MR. BEN TURNER:  That is with a helper, of course.  It vmeans really two persons,  does it not?     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   Well, it depends entirely on the type cf yarn,  You will work 20 if you are using a yarn in which there are breaks, - that is, of course, compared with one person on 4 looms.     MR. BEN TURNER:  Or six.     SIR KENNETH STEWART:   Well, I cannot say there are manycases of six being used in Lancashire.  With six you have tohave a very perfect yarn for ordinary Lancashire looms.
there is a considerable turnover of shares and the  greatboom in Wall Street last year is too recent for this  to be without at least a psychological effect upon interest ratesin other parts of the world.   It may also be hindering afurther fall in the American Federal Reserve Rates  with whichcur own bank rate must be expected to keep- pace.     The prolonged inertia into which our own stock marketshad fallen was broken during the month by a boom in gilt-edged securities that reached a very considerable scale.  Therise in prices was very fast and long-dated BritishGovernment securities had soon risen to something like a  4%?obasis.   Some reaction has come with the check in fallinginterest rates but there have been a number of new issues,mostly of the gilt-edged sort, which have been very successful     The exchange position continues to be satisfactory  andthe Bank of England&apos;s holding of gold had increased lastweek to about  158,000,000.  There is a good deal of australian gold on the way to London.     The reduction in floating debt has proceeded further and Treasury Bills now amount to only  590,000,000  comparedwith  730,000,000 at the end of last year, a reduction of nearly  200,000,000 in three months and a reduction of about 110,000,000 compared with the 31st March 1989.  The floatingdebt as a whole&quot; is almost exactly  100,000,000 lower than itwas a 3&apos;ear ago.     CHAIRMAN:  I suppose it is hardly possible to go onreducing that floating debt at the moment?     LORD BRADBURYs  Many people think that it has alreadybeen reduced to a dangerous extent.  Mr. mckenna in particularI dare say you will see, is a very severe critic of the policyof reduction of the floating debt.   Personally I am notinclined to agree with him.  I think a rapid reduction is dangerous, but to the extent to which we could have a smallercirculation of Treasury Bills and have the hiatus filled by  ahigher circulation of foreign bills I think would be all tothe good of the London market.  But that would have to be a gradual thing.  One of the encouraging things this month isthe sign that there is a better supply of foreign bills.     CHAIRMAN:  There was a considerable rise last year of 80,000,000 and if you compare it with two years ago the dropwould not be very large.LORD BRADBURY:  That is so.
                         IRyK AKD  STEEL.     Mr. PUSH  sent  the  following  report:-     The workpeople  in  the  iron and  steel  industry, with theexception of a few localities, have  been working  short  timethroughout the month, and from reports received it would appear &apos;that new business is not being received to the extent desired todispel the general  felling  of uncertainty  in  the  industry.     Pig iron  trade.    The  principal item  of  news with  respect tothis trade is  the drop  of   5/- per ton in  the price of  Clevelandpig iron at the middle  of the month. This marks  the first changein the official price since last  June.  The reduction seems tohave had the desired effect of increasing  the volume of business.     The Hematite Pig Iron  Trade  in  Barrow remains depressed.     The Pipe  Foundry Trade is purchasing  large quantities of pigiron, and in this connexion it may be mentioned that the StaveleyCoal and Iron  Company are reported to have obtained a contract forthe supply of 21,OC? tons of pipes for Egypt.     Finished  iron trade.   In South  Staffordshire the sales forbest Iron have been fairly  well maintained, but business in theother classes of Wrought Iron is  very slack,  and  there  is keencompetition for orders  against continental prices.     Steel trade.   There is very little change for the better toreport in this section  of the industry.  In the export  trade,Dorman Long &amp; Company,  have orders for 12, utv tons of structuralsteel for Shanghai, and 9,uvU tons of steel sleepers for the african Railways.     The Central Argentine  Railway has placed a structural steeloontract to the value of  20,uu0  with Morton  and  Company, Garston,near Liverpool; and Braithwaite and  Company have  secured a contract for erecting a  bridge in India which will require 10,000tons of steel.     The English Steel  Corporation have, in the face of keencompetition,  secured orders from  the continent for 74 forge steelboiler drums, and also  a large order for forgings for TurbineRotars.  This contract will necessitate the production  of approxim-ately 5,OOo tons of steel ingots, and will  provide work for a numberof Sheffield employees.     Sheet trade.   Since the revision of  prices  of steel sheetsthe home trade in this  commodity  has improved somewhat,  and althoughexport trade is still very disappointing, it is reported that theSouth iimerican market is reviving a  little.     Tinplates.

WOOL.     ALDERMAN M.F. TITTERINGTON sent the following report % -(1)  During the past few weeks the wages trouble in the wool -textile Industry has reached a crisis.     In 1925 a Court of Arbitration stabilised wages for theperiod ending January 1st, 1927.  In 1927 the employers askedfor reductions, and terminated the existing agreement InNovember 1927, though no change was then made in wage rates.     Various unsuccessful negotiations took place in 1928 and1929, and towards the end of last year a complete deadlockwas reached.  The Minister of Labour appointed a Court of inquiry (consisting of Lord Macmillan), which sat in Januaryof this year.  Lord Macmillan&apos;s Report recommended a reduotionof 9f per cent in time workers&apos; wages and 8f per cent. Inpiece workers1 wages.
     The employers offered to make an agreement embodyingthese reductions, but a ballot taken by several of theunions showed a 72 per cent, majority against acceptance.The employers gave notice of their intention to introduce 1the reduced rates this week.   The trade unions, inaccordance with their ballot vote, have Instructed their members not to accept the reductions but to withdraw their labour.   An offer by the trade unions to concede a reductionof 5.8 and 5.34 per cent, respectively for time and pieceworkers has been rejected by the employers.    There  the  position stands  at  the  time  of writing.(2) In the commission piece-dyeing section, negotiations between employers and operatives have resulted in are organisation of working conditions with a view to increasedeconomy.   This has been necessitated by the reducedquantity of goods which is being dyed (due to bad trade),and more particularly by the small quantities dyed to ashade.   In comparison with before the war, there has beena marked decline in the average size of the  lots handled.This decline is still in operation as a result of the hand-to-mouth trading which is universally adopted from theretailer downwards, and which has been accentuated by the continuous decline in wool values.     The reorganisation scheme will not lead to anydismissal of workpeople, but It lias necessitated certain concessions by the workpeople In the methods of working.The work is mainly done on the group piece-work system, andthe surplus operatives are to be absorbed.   This In effect will mean a slightly larger amount of short-time, whichwill be shared out amongst the operatives so as to avoidactual dismissals.(3)  The wool-textile industry as a whole remains in adepressed condition, and is less active than at any time since 1921.   The enormous slump in wool values has been anImportant factor.   Wool values on the average in march were 25 per cent, below the level of July, 1914,   This very low level of values, in conjunction with cheap money, seemsat last to be encouraging speculators as well as users, andat the moment prices have recovered a little  and there isa more stable feeling,   A restoration of confidence invalues, by causing a greater disposition to place forwardcontracts and carry larger working stocks, would help tocreate a certain amount of employment.     The demand for cloth, however, is ultimately dependenton the purchasing power of the consumer, and  in this respect the outlook is not very favourable at the moment, and is dependent on the state of trade and employment at home andabroad.   Unfortunately a fall in wool values is not immediately reflected in a fall in the price  of clothesto the consumer.     There are strong hopes, however, that the wool-textile industry will  show a partial recovery at an earlier stagethan many other industries.   Even if people  cannot buyclothes freely for the time being, they  are still wearingthem    and wearing them out.   The man who makes his oldsuit  last longer than usual is compelled sooner or later to replenish, his wardrobe.
     Fashion is favouring the use of wool in ladies&apos; wear,and the lengthening of the skirt may help matters.   some very useful propaganda work is being done by the BradfordChamber of Commerce In bringing Bradford dress goodsdirectly to the notice of Paris fashion houses.     Whilst the outlook cannot be described as rosy, there seems to be a feeling that the bottom of the slump hasbeen reached or nearly reached, and if the wages problemcan be solved it is possible that there may be a slighttendency towards improvement in the not too distant future.                       .  HOSIERY.     Sir. Walker sent the following report:-     Leicester.  There is not much improvement to reportin the Hosiery trade this month, and the uncertainty outlined in our last report still continues.   All sections areslack and below the average for the time of the year, andbuyers appear to be awaiting the result of the Budgetannouncements before making any commitments.   The under-selling in the home market of cheap foreign manufacturedgoods and increasing tariffs in Overseas countries andthe Dominions are proving Insurmountable handicaps toifenufacturers whose Individual demands for some immediate and strong action by the Government are becoming more andmore insistent.     Nottingham.  A slight improvement Is reported in thestate of the trade generally.   Buyers are apparentlyconvinced&apos;that the bottom has been reached as regardsprices in the raw materials of wool and cotton, and inconsequence some orders have been placed for the Autumntrade.   Wool, in fact, now shews a slightly hardeningtendency.     An encouraging feature is the report from the wholesale houses that  orders for summer underwear are beginning to come in well.   It would appear that retaildistributors, owing to the good summer last year, practicallycleared out all  stocks.     The export trade  is, on the whole, rather quiet, andas regards Australia,  fears are entertained that when full details are received of the proposed new Customs Duties,the little business now being done will be  completely stopped.     With regard to the Hose trade, Silk and artificial silk hose still remains depressed, partly owing to thegeneral trade depression throughout the country, and partly to the uncertainty as  regards the Silk and Artificial Silkduties, buyers holding off until they  see the  result ofthe Budget.   Cashmere hose  Is not too good, which  is onlyto be expected at this period of the year, but the Children&apos;ssox trade is fairly good for  the time  of  the year.      Hinckley.  Trade  still  continues very  bad,  with unemployment at  above  normal.   Business  in the Silk and Arti-fielal Silk Hose section is very  depressed, and  manufacturers,despairing  of  getting  their  machinery  going, are turningto Cotton and  other substitutes.
     Mansfield.   Conditions are, if anything, worse than last month, and this applies to every branch of theindustry in this district.   Mven the Fashioned Fancy trade which has always been busy, has complained of a falling off, both for home and export.   Conditions obviously willbe no better until after the Budget, and when Wool has reached a stable basis.     Hawiok.   There is really nothing further to reporthere,&quot; and&quot; trade&apos;is if anything worse than it was at this time last month,  and future prospects look very gloomy.     Lou.ghborough.   Reports from Loughborough state that trade is very bad, worso than for many years.   A greatdeal of short time is being worked, and the complaints aregeneral with regard to the heavy importation of foreigngoods and the uncertainty of the Artificial Silk duties.                      OHSMIGAL INDUSTRY.     MR, HILL handed in tie foil owing report-     Periodical report on Sulphuric Acid, the consumption ofwhich has for long; been regarded as a rough index of the.*Wi3ra.yindustrial activity of the^ounbrjv^     The statistics covering the year 1929 and relating tothe United Kingdom and the whole cf Ireland are now available.All weights are expressed in tons of 2,240 lb. on the basisof 100$ sulphuric acid.     During the first six months of the year 488,000 tons ofsulphuric acid were manufactured, and plant was working at71,3$ of what may be considered reasonable capacity, allowing for the normal periods of repair. &apos;  During the second halfof the year the production was 479,000 tons, plant working at 70,3% capacity.     The slight fall in the second half of the year cannot beregarded as temporary, as there is every indication that thefirst six months of the present year, 1930, will show amarked diminution in output.   A slump seems to have set in about the beginning of February, and shows signs of becoming more and more serious as the year advances.   Reports from spain, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany indicate thaton the Continent the slump is, if anything, more Beyere, endless easy to explain than in the British Isles.     The reasons given for this, apart from financial considerations, such as the crisis in America last year, andthe present uncertainties as to future taxation and tariffs,seem to-be summed up in the one word over-joroduction,  such industries as artificial silk, sulphate of ammonia,superphosphates, margarine manufacture, and oil refining, all of which are large users of sulphuric acid, have themselvesbeen afflicted with over-production.   They are now perforcecurtailing, and consequently demand less sulphuric acid.     Dealing with the year 1929, production in the british isles was the highest on record since 1920:  the following
JMfigures show the production during the last five years:-               19S5 .......... .... 848,000 tons.               1926 .............. 722,000   &quot;               1927 .......... .... 889,000   &quot;               1928............... 928,000   &quot;               1929 .......,...... 967,000   &quot;     As regards the consumption of raw materials, little change is shown as compared with 1928, as will &quot;be seen from thefollowing figures giving all the raw materials used in theproduction of sulphuric acid:-               Pyrites   Spent Oxide   Brimstone   Zinc Ores     19.88      329,000     174,000      58*300      115,400     1929      363,500     174,500      52,700      115,600There is, however, a notable decrease in the amount of brimstoneused, which is compensated for by the increase in the pyritesimported.   The orily home-produced ravv material, * namely spentoxide, shows a maximum consumption, which is probably slightly in excess of production, with the rersult that stocks havefallen, and the price of spent oxide has advanced by ahovtt 4/-a ton during the year.     The figures showing the trend in the selling price of theacid may be of interest.   Talcing the last three months of 1924as a bcsis, and giving it an index figure of 100, the figure for the first six months of 1929 was 80.7 and for the last sixmonths 78.3.     In view of the increase in the cost of spent oxidereferred to above, and of the threatened very material increasein the cost of brimstone from Sicily, it is improbable that theprice of sulphuric acid will continue to fall in the immediatefuture, if, indeed, it is not found necessary to increase itto some extent.                          MOIGY MARKET,     SIS GUY GRA1HTsent the following Report:-     The downward trend of money rates which has been inevidence practically since the beginning of the year continued throughout the month of March, and on the 20th ultimo the3ank of England lowered the official discount rate from 4?o to3-g$.   This change of the official minimum however, merelyreduced the disparity between the Bank Rate and Market Ratefrom 1-gj&apos;S to 1$, the latter rate on March .20th being about 2f$.During the last week of March the market rate further declinedand owing to the scarcity of bills was at one time about^4.6%&apos;     ^ith the turn of the month theJ?ill .rates havehardened and the quotation is now about 2^.5ths %*     The fact that three months&apos;bills purchased at the endof March mature at the end of the half year caused the Banksto compete rather keenly for such paper, and this, togetherwith the short supply in the hands of the home Banks was mainly responsible for rates dipping so low at that time.  the prevailing rates have caused an increase in the use of London
   JrWT-     311Acceptance facilities principally for German account,  and Iunderstand that American and Belgian correspondents have alsobeen making more use of their London Acceptance facilities.The Supply of Bank Bills has consequently increased and this movement has influenced the firmer tendency of discountrates.   The increase in the German use of London Acceptancefacilities has probably to some extent contributed to  therecent weakness of the London-Berlin Exchange, and coupled with the transfer of French and other deposits from London to berlin has been responsible for the shipments of gold  whichhave lately been made to Germany.     The rate for Gall money has been generally a littleabove the Bill Rate but as the quick decline in the Discountrate has stimulated the turnover in Billsr money has not beenvery uncomfbrtahle and it was only necessary for the market to borrow at the Bank of England around the turn of the quarter.     The lower level of money has been responsible for amarked firmness in gilt-edged securities and various newissues of this class, such as Corporation stocks, which untilthe end of February were being mainly left with the under-writers, have been quickly oversubscribed at higher prices andthose loans which had previously been neglected by investorsare now quoted at substantial premiums.   This movementhas also extended to certain Industrial stocks, particularly those with an international market, which have been affectedby the firmer tone of the Hew York Stock Markets.                        GENERAL TRADE.     MR. LENNOX LEE cent the following reports-     The general trade position remains unchanged.    Thevolume of business during the past month has been moderateonly, the spring seasonal movement being notably slight inextent.     This failure to make progress is in the mainattributable to the continuance of the world wide businessre-act ion, to Y/hich reference has been made in previousmonthly reports.   An important feature of this reaction hasbeen the almost precipitous fall in the prices of staple commodities, a fall which has not only been responsible for aconsiderable loss of purchasing power,  but has enforcedecconomy in practically all important trading countries.     The outstanding development among the influences making for recuperation is the sharp fall in money rates which isstill proceeding in the principal international monetarj^centres under the leadership of the Bank of England.     it is,however, still too early to judge whether this movement hasbeen sufficiently prolonged to arrest the general fall inpx-ices, an essential pre-requisite to a restoration of thatelement of business confidence needed to produce a sustainedrenewed upward turn in the trend of trade.
                   RETAIL DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE sent the following report:-     Owing to the number of factors which vitiate the comparison,it is almost impossible this month to arrive at a true estimateof conditions in the distributive trades during March,     The chief disturbing influence has undoubtedly been the variation in the date of Easter, as last year the whole of the easter Trade came into the March figures.   Furthermore, owing tothe bad weather in February 1929, trade last March was, generallyspeaking, exceptionally good, so that this year&apos;s figures have to                             COTTON.      MIU LENNOX LEE sent the following report:-     A slight improvement in the condition of the Cotton Tradewas registered during March though the fluctuation in vaMcotton prices has hampered progress.   During the second week of the month American Cotton dropped to a low level, Spot at liverpool being quoted 7,88d per lb,   A few days later, however,values rose a half penny per lb,   Egyptian cotton on the otherhand has remained fairly- steady,   The rise in American cottonbrought out numerous enquiries towards the end of the month,India in particular showing prominence.   China, on the  otherhand, has still remained disappoint!hg and little business hasbeen done for that centre,   Egypt, The Levant, Dutch east indies, Singapore and Java have, on the whole, been dull.  Thelow prices obtainable for the principal products of SouthAmerica during the last few months have caused conditions to be generally unsatisfactory.   There has, however, been some improvement during recent weeks, particularly in Brazil,The Argentine and Colombia,     In the Bleaching Section the volume of trade has been at a lower level even than that of February, and a period which is usually characterised by a seasonal improvement hasshown a further recession.   Trade has been at as low a level as in the months immediately succeeding the cotton stoppagelast year and the future prospects are by no means satisfactory in view of recent conditions in the principal foreign markets.     Taking the staple lines together dyeing production has fallen to about three-quarters of what it was a yearago.   The decline in the Home Trade may be attributed to thestock-taking and Budget anticipations.   In Shipping the falling off has been general.     There, is no definite improvement to be recorded in thecalico printing section.   The fluctuation in the raw cottonmarket during the month checked any revival especially inthe shipping.   This coupled with the uncertainty which was created in the Indian Market by reason of the unsettlementover fiscal proposals has meant that the low returns for february have continued more or less throughout March,Production for the higher class home trade lines is goodin anticipation of the season&apos;s requirements but day to daybuying whether for home trade or for shipping is stagnant.

In passing, it may be said that one of the greatest services which the present Government could render to the distributive trades, and indeed to all industries which depend largely onseasonal conditions, is to expedite agreement with the othercountries concerned on the date of a fixed Easter.   It cannot be repeated too of ten,, that the present arrangement, under which thedate of Easter varies from year to year, not only results in greatinconvenience and confusion, by rendering comparative figuresalmost valueless, but is the cause of definite loss to the tradesaffected.   It means this year that the season commences at least three weeks late, and that time, once lost,.is almost impossible tomake up during the rest of the half year.   Under these circumstances it is almost impossible to say to what extent general economicconditions are reflected in the experience of retail trade during march.   Trade during the first week or ten days was undoubtedlyvery slack, and remained without much perceptible change until thelast week, when, as might be expected, the  commencement of Easterbuying caused some improvement.   Making all allowances, however,it may fairly be assumed that general conditions must have had some influence on the unfavourable experience reflected in thefigures to hand.

MR.HOSE sent the following report:     In considering the Argentine commercial outlook for thocurrent year, it is of interest to observe that the view is heldin some quarters that the actual volume of production in theRepublic to be marketed during 1930 will closely approach thatof previous years, with the exception, however, of those from1926 to 1929, when harvests and conditions generally were of an exceptional character.   That is to say, It is thought that thevolume of production may be in the neighbourhood of that in the&quot;normal&quot; periods prior to 1926.     It is further suggested that the internal trado of theRepublic is developing proportionately with greater rapiditythan the export trade.   Undoubtedly, the two leading factors which account fov the lessened activity in the export trade thisyear are reduced crops of wheat and linseed and the generallylower level of prices of export produce, and certainly, the con-sumptive demand in Argentina is likely to be distinctly loss thanthat of the past three years.     Mail advice&apos;s from Argentina indicate that the commercialsituation in general is quiot.   Weather conditions have beenvery variable, with heavy rains in some districts, which will be* Areas under production.   Other- figures relate to output.

very beneficial for the pasturage.   Unfortunately, however,  insome quarters, the rain arrived too late to save the maize.    Theonly Province that promises to have a good maize crop is the-Province of Buenos Aires, while the district between buenos aires and Rosario will give yields -slightly. above the normal.All the other regions, such as Santa Fe, Co&quot;rdoba, and Sntre P.ios,will havo disappointing crops.     Reports have recently been current in London that theArgentine Government has in hand negotiations in the Now Yorkmarket for a substantial loan, and, while such reports areunconfirmed and in some quarters have been denied, a distinctlyfirmer tendency has developed in the rates of exchange - atendency which is hard to explain apart from the rumours just mentioned.     In the import markets, sales of cotton yarns have recentlyimproved, and stocks are stated to be low,   Buyers of summertextile goods, however, dalayed their usual heavy Februaryorders owing to the uncertainty of the exchange position.     Turning to Brazil, it is satisfactory that the quiet and orderly manner in which the Presidential elections took placehas done much to relieve the general feeling of anxiety In thelocal markets, and that trade shows signs of returning confidenceThe major consideration Is, of course, the prospects in regardto coffee, and, in this connection, it is reported from SaoPaulo that arrangements for a large loan for the Coffee Instituteshould be completed shortly, and that this has contributed tothe optimistic tendency,   ioney is stated to be circulatingmore freely, although the markets for imported goods continueinactive, with the outlook uncertain.     Active conditions are maintained in the Santos market for&quot;coffee.   Exports of the commodity during the first two monthsof the current year showed an increase of 387,638 bags on thosoin the corresponding period of 1929.   Moreover, the stock of coffee in Santos is still considerably below the limit of1,200,000 bags fixed by the Coffee Institute, and the maximumfor daily entries has been raised further, the limit feeing now50,000 bags.   In Santos, It is expected that the demand fromabroad will absorb the increased deliveries and that largoshipments will continue.     In Sao Paulo, credit conditions remain unsatisfactory,although there are fewer failures.   Generally speaking, the toneof the money market is somewhat easier.     In Chile, the business situation shows little change since a month ago.   Imports at Santiago tend to increase, but the retail trade is undergoing normal seasonal dullness, althoughthe total turnover is above that of last year,   Sales in alllines are active in the agricultural areas south of Santiago,The labour released by the closing of many nitrate oficinas -maypresent a problem in the near future.     According to the monthly  statement of the Controller-General of Chile, the national revenue for ths month of January,1930, totalled 150,676,269 pesos, the expenditure for- the sameperiod being 69,210,529 pesos.   There was therefore an excess ofrevenue over expenditure of 81,465,740 pesos, which, however,Includes the surplus of 77,622,402 pesos brought in from 1929,
     Provisional returns of the foreign trade of Chile showthat the total value of exports for the year 1929 was2,282,800,000 pesos, as compared with 1,964j3-00,000 pesos for1928, while imports amounted to 1,601,200,000 pesos, against.200,000,000 pesos.   The surplus of exports for last year was therefore &quot;681,600,000 pesos, as compared with 764,300,000pesos in the preceding twelve months.     During the month of December last, the total value of exports showed an appreciable reduction, mainly on account ofa decline in nitrate exports.   On the other hand, the total value of imports in the same month increased substantially,to 152,700,000 pesos.   This increased volume of imports was attributable to purchases of materials, etc., &quot;by government Departments, such as the State Railways,   ITitrateexports in 1929 represented a proportion of 41.6 per cent, ofthe total value of exports, against 47.6 per cent, in 1928,while the proportion of copper exports, including bars, ore,and concentrates, was 40,5 per cent,, against 31,7 per cent,reflecting further the increasing importance of copper inChile&apos;s economic life.     In general, business in Uruguay during February showed afurther decline, and orders for imported goods are not being placed freely.   The decline which occurred in exchange at onetime temporarily stimulated the sale of wool, but prices are much lower than a year ago,   A Law has been enacted authorising the Uruguayan Government to purchase over a period of fiveyears the exportable surplus of wheat at a price of five pesosper 100 kilos at port of embarkation for this year&apos; - crop.     Business conditions in&apos;Peru continue dull.   Collectionsare slow and difficult, and, in some cases, drawees desire to delay payments.   Prospects for the cotton crop are good, butprices, which have continued low, are dropping as a result ofthe large stocks of last yearTs crop remaining unsold at liverpool.    Sugar growers continue affected by the low pricesruling, and small planters are turning to cotton*   the disposition Is not to increase the production of copper, onaccount of the low current prices, while neither silver norzinc can be mined at a profit.     During the past month, the Peruvian Government hasenacted a new-monetary law which brings into operation thelegal stabilisation of the currency.   The new unit is thegold &quot;sol&quot;, and the Law stipulated that 10 gold soles areexchangeable for one Peruvian pound ef the old currency.   the sterling parity is now 12.165 soles to the   sterling.     Latest mail advices received from Colombia state that the tone of the coffee market is somewhat weaker.   Following therecent Presidential Election, the political is quiet, and theresults of the Election have given general satisfaction.Transport conditions on the River Magdalena are good.   Inregard to the general commercial situation,  there is a betterdemand for merchandise, and a further improvement isanticipated in the near future.    Official estimates of exports from Colombia during 1929 place the total at 125,000,000 pesos,as compared with 150,000,000 pesos in 1928.  It is anticipatedthat the Spring coffee crop will amount to 900,000 bags.
     Provisional returns of Ecuadorian foreign trade for theyear 1929 show that the total value of exports was 85,036,822sucres, while imports totalled 84,827,500 sucres.    Thecorresponding figures for 1928 were 98,299,074 sucres and75,250,901 sucres, respectively.   Economic and businessconditions in Ecuador continue dull, and complaints continue  tohe made regarding difficult of making collections, as well as of the low volume of sales.   The Christmas cocoa crop wasdisappointing.   The volume of imports continues to herestricted.   Latest reports regarding the 1930 cocoa crop havenot been so favourable as those received earlier in the year,although the crop should still be satisfactory.     There has been a steady improvement recently in conditionsin Guatemala,   The better qualities of high grade coffees havebeen in great demand, and the general tone of the market is firm.The Guatemalan Government is making every endeavour to reduceBudget expenses, which, if it were brought about, would tend tostrengthen the economic situation of the country.   The outlook for the 1930-31 coffee crop appears excellent.   Prices of the commodity in the Republic have shown an advancing tendency, andthe financial position of many of the coffee growers is distinctlymore favourable.   There is, in fact, a far more optimisticfeeling among the plantation owners than has been the case formany months -past.     The general improvement in the commercial situation inSalvador, which commenced in the latter part of January was fullymaintained throughout the following month and the demand forcoffee from overseas markets was sustained.   The volume ofimports appears to be on an average with that of previous years.

                  WOi-LLEM AMD WuRSTBD INDUSTRY.     MR.  HAMILTON handed in the following report :-     Employment in March was bad and on the whole  worse than inFebruary.  At this time of the year it is usual  for employment to improve in the Worsted Section of the Industry  and to becomeworse generally in the Woollen Section,  During the past month,the seasonal improvements have not been sufficient to counter-balance the decline arising out of the acute trade depression.     In the Vool Sorting and Combing Section, employment wasbad but somewhat better than in February.  In worsted spinningthere was little change and that was in a downward direction.     With worsted manufacturers there was an improvement inthe light goods section, namely, with firms in Bradford andKeighley  making linings, dress goods, etc., but  there was adecline with firms in the Silsden, Keighley and  Bradforddistricts who are mainly engaged on art silk mixtures.     With coating manufacturers of Bradford and  Keighley andthe fine  cloth section of Huddersfield, Halifax  and Leeds(worsted) employment was worse than a month ago.   The changein Huddersfield is quite noticeable.  In Halifax employment inthis section has been bad for so long that any small change isinsignificant.     In the woollen section, employment was bad  except atYeadon and Guiseley.  The ioulk of the trade done in these districts is very much subjected to seasonable influences andas has happened in previous years, there was a considerable increase  of activity in March and this will probably continuethrough April, after which the seasonal Influence  will probablybe In a downward direction, bringing this district into line with the  other wooller. districts.     Employment was fair at ^orley but not as good as a month ago, while in the Heavy Woollen District, it was bad in all sections.     In the Calder Vale district, the improvement  noticed inthe last  two or three months Was maintained, but not developed.In the Euddersfield and Colne Valley district employment was badand worse than a. month ago,     v ith flannel manufacturers at Rochdale and  Saddleworth,there was some slight improvement.  With blanket manufacturers of Dewsbury and the Calder Valley district employment was bad.     on the whole, employment was bad to very bad.
