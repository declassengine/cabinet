flTSJQCPPMT JS THE. PROPERTY- OF  HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos; S GOVERNMENT)JJLiLS-T-                                        Copy No. .P.H9G0).           Committee  on Policv  in East Africa.  Note by the Secretary of State for India.        I do not wish to take any such formal stepas to circulate a Minute of Dissent from the Report ofthe Committee&quot;  hut there are two matters to which Ishould, draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention.I -  S cheme ; f or 01o ser Union in Ea st Africa.        Paragraphs 2-7&apos;  Under these paragraphs theHigh Commissioner is given a Council for the administrationcf common services in the three territories.  ThisCouncil;, in dealing with matters such as railway rates,customs and others, will be touching matters directlyaffecting the native as against the European interest.Whereas the Hilton Young Report unanimously suggestedthat this Council should be advisory, under the scheme proposed it is Legislative.  I greatly fear that thiswill be the object of criticism, particularly by Membersof our own Party, for the following reasons.   In theCouncil the settler element will be very strong;  as theofficial members will take orders, not from the HighCommissioner but from their respective Governors - and theGovernor of Kenya at all events is apt to be influenced  bythe Euro-Deans&apos; views - there will be no coherent official        -bloc and the High Commissioner will therefore have nomeans of enforcing his&apos; views.  It may be urged, therefore.,                                                       that
that the Council will, in effect, develop into a parliament unduly influenced by the settlers&apos;  views.II.  Proposed Constitution of the Legislative  Council      of Kenya.Franchise.        The Cabinet Sub-Committee has agreed &quot;on a common roll.  -This being so, I suggest the omission  of paragraph 5which describes, not a common roll, but an amalgamatedroll, consisting of two communal rolls.  The retention ofthis paragraph is not really necessary as it is only  asuggestion to the High Commissioner who is directed tomake enquiries with a view to carrying out the policy ofthe common roll.         if suggest also-the following three verbalamendments, to the first of which, for reasons which  Ishall explain to the Cabinet, I attach considerable importance:-        Page 4, paragraph 3? lines 4 and 5* . Leave out&quot;however distant may be its attainment&quot;.        line 5D leave out &quot;common&quot; and insert  &quot;equal&quot;.        Paragraph 4, line 2.  Leave out &quot;can only&quot;and insert &quot;must be&quot; .                             W.B.7th April 1930.
