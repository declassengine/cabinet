It also omits provision for the  Agricultural marketing bill, and for the (usually formal)  Isle of Man Customs Bill,     Except for the allowance under &quot;Contingencies&quot;, there isno provision for the discussion of Lords&quot; Amendments (if any)to the Coal Mines Bill and other Bills,     The allowance for the Valuation Bill (2 days) is meagre;on the other hand that for the Finance Bill is possibly rather more generous than necessary.     The allowance of 3 days for Land Drainage (HL) Bill maynot be required,  since discussion of this Bill in the Lords  maynot be sufficiently expeditious for the Bill to  reach the commons  in  time to pass this Session.III.  Standing Committees.     Standing Committee A will be fully occupied with theHousing Bill until the middle of June, and thereafter with                              -3-
smaller Bills.     Standing Committee C will be fully occupied XV ITH theRoad Traffic Bill until about the end of May.     In order to cope with the Consumers&apos; Council Bill andthe Land Drainage (HL) Bill it will be necessary to set upStanding Committee D.     But if Standing Committee D Is set up at once, therewill be no outlet for the Lend Valuation Bill should progress on the Road Traffic Bill be held up.   At the cost of some slight risk to the Consumers&apos; Council Bill and a greater risk to the Land Drainage Bill it  is therefore suggested thatStanding Committee D be not set up until the end of the road traffic Bill  is  in sight.IV.
