g,E:,,&amp;R E, T. P.  125. (30).COPY NO.^2CABIN E T0VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS,Memorandum by. the President of the Board of Education.With reference to my previous Memorandum (CP. 73/30),I am now in a position to report that I have had further conversations with the representatives of the various interests.concerned with the Voluntary Schools, and I am of opinion that nofurther purpose can be served in continuing these discussions.There is a very considerable measure of agreement obtainableand I believe that now the best course to adopt would be to publish as a White Paper the conclusions which the Governmenthave arrived at as most likely to so2ve the immediate problemof the Voluntary Schools.    I think it likely that publicitywould reveal such a large measure of agreement in the House ofCommons as to facilitate rather than hinder the passage of theEducation (School Attendance) Bill.of the attached statement, as a White Paper during, or immediatelyafter, the Recess..I therefore propose to publish a document, on the lines(Intd. )  C. T.11th April, 1930.
               B 0 A R D   OF_,   D U G A TIP li .        PROPOSALS  for enabling LOCAL LDIJCkTOlON AUTHORITIES        to enter into agreements with the ,MO*-.(LR . of NOK-        PR0VIDLD SCHOOLS  for purposes of RE-ORGANISATION .          The public system of education in England and Wales isat the present time undergoing a&apos; complete re-organise, tIon, whichwas inaugurated three years ago as a result of the Report ofthe Consultative Committee of the Board of Education, issued inDecember, 1926, under the title of &quot;The Education of theAdolescent&quot;, and commonly known as the Kadow Report.  Therecommendations of this Report have been accepted by the Board,by educational opinion^&apos; and by the country at large, as a greatadvance in the opportunities of  education for the majority ofchildren-  The principal change  involved in the new system isthat, from the age of eleven onwards, all children should beeducated in senior schools of one type or another, capable ofproviding a varied and progressive course of education forolder children.          His Majesty,s Government have further implemented therecommendations of the Hadow Report by Introducing legislation for the raising of the school leaving age to fifteen, so  thatthe senior school courses would  cover a period of  at least fouryears from the age of eleven.          These changes, in order to be effective, ere requiringall over the country a considerable increase in the accommoda-tion of many existing schools, and in some cases  the building of entirely new senior schools.  For the re-organised seniorschools  ,&apos;;ill be characterised by smaller classes, wideropportunities for practical instruction such as woodwork  andcookery, science rooms, libraries, adequate halls, and  increased and additional playing grounds and playing fields.          The early and economical re-organisation of the schoolsdepends  on  the extent to Aaich the Voluntary Schools are  ableto play  their part-:  5hile  In many cases  laudable efforts
are &quot;being made by the Voluntary School Authorities to  meet thenew situation, there are many cases whore the Managers,  howeveranxious to co-operate, find themselves hampered by the difficul-ty of providing the necessary funds for re-conditioning orenlarging their schools.   It is, of course,  open to LocalEducation Authorities to supply the deficiency, where voluntary schools cannot provide accommodation, by &quot;building new CouncilSchools.   This, however, is a needlessly extravagant methodwherever the expenditure of far less money would put existingschools into the position to fulfil the new need.     His Majesty&apos;s Government, while well aware of thedifficulty of proposing any change in the relations of the state to the Voluntary Schools as established by the Act of 1902,undertook last year to consult the representatives of all theimportant interests concerned with a view to seeing whether there was any probability of an agreed settlement.  . Thesituation has been explored in all its aspects.   Frequentconversations have taken placo with persons as representativeas possible of the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church,the Free Churches, the Local Authorities, and the Teachers,  these conversations have been carried on in all cases in the most friendly, helpful and constructive spirit and with a recognition   1of the paramount importance of the interests of the children;and although it will be understood that the representatives whohave taken part in the discussions are not commit ted,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel justified in stating their belief that a measure of agreement may be found on the basis of theproposals set out below.  The essence of these proposals isthat Local Education Authorities should be permitted to givefinancial assistance to Voluntary Schools for purposes of re-organisation in exchange for an extension of public control in the matter of the appointment and removal of teachers.
                      SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS *               ,^ ?0     Where  the  enlargement, reconstruction, or improvement of  a Non-provided School  is required to give effect to re- organisation proposals  approved by the Board of Education, a Local Education Authority may maze an agreement with the Managers  of that Non-provided School to give such grant as is  necessary for such enlargement, reconstruction or improve- ment.     Where  such a grant is made the teachers of the school concerned shall become  the servants of the Local Education Authority and shall be  appointed and removable by them.     The  Managers shall. 1, however, have the right to be con- suited and  to be satisfied that such and so many of the teachers  of the school  as are necessary for the purpose are willing and competent to give special religious instruction in  accordance with the  provisions (if any) of the Trust Peed and as required by the  Managers.- .    The  agreement shall specify the number of teachers in regard, to whom  the Managers have the right to be so consulted. and satisfied,  due regard being given to the number of children whose parents desire them to have such special religious instruction.     No teacher shall be dismissed except  by the Local Education Authority, but  the Managers may ask the Local Education Authority to  remove a teacher on the ground that-having been appointed to give special religious instruction, he has failed  to give such instruction efficiently and suitably.&apos; In  case of  difference as to the removal of such a teacher, which cannot be settled between the Local Education Authority and the Managers, it shall be referred to&apos; the Board of Educa- tion for  decision.     The  Managers, after the execution of the specific enlarge- merit, reconstruction or  improvement, will retain their
242 JLB4)&apos; existing responsibility for repairs,(7)   The premises  shall continue  to he used  for  the purpose of a Public Elementary School so  long as  that use is necessary.(8)   wliere, owing to  re-organisation, children are trans - ferred to a Provided  School from  a Eon-provided  School,  the Local Education Authority shall permit arrangements to be made, on the lines of what is known as the Arson bye-law, for withdrawing such  children, if desired by their parents, for special religious instruction outside the school.
