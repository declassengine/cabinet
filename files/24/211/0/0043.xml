mis document  is  the property of his britahnic majesty1 s                    c A B   S S memorandum  BY  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  POR  SCOTLAND.^          In the suggestions which hare been made for &amp; whitsPaper on Agricultural Policy prominence has &quot;been given to the encouragement of organised marketing.   I strongly support this proposal for the following reasonss-   ls     The Overseas Dominions and other competing countries by legislation or through agreement among the producersthemselves have standardised some of their products and nowplace them on the British Market in conditions of uniform gradeand quality.   This is a great advantage to the distributorwho Is enabled to purchase on stated grades or sizes withouteven finding it necessary to examine his purchases before -hand.   New Zealand lamb for example may be obtained inhundreds of carcases precisely similar, whereas to secure some hundreds of British lamb of equal quality and sizemight entail nany separate purchases in several markets.The home producer is thus handicapped, although the freshnessand quality of his product may fee superior.   2.     The spread between the producers&apos; and the consumers&apos;price is apparently greater than is necessary to secure theservices performed by the middle man.   An undue toll is taken from the producer to maintain auction marts, selling agencies and distributive services of various kinds.   The commodities which the farmer requires such as feeding stuffs and fertilisers are largely controlled by pools and rings.   against these formidable organisations the farmer is at a greatdisadvantage.   3.     The Agricultural produce (Grading and Marking) Acthas established national grades and marks for someagricultural commodities and encouraging results are forth-coming.   The scheme is voluntary, however, and as yet only small numbers of producers are taking advantage of it,probably not 10$.   So long as the great body of producerscontinue to market in a haphazard way, the full benefits ofbetter marketing cannot be obtained.    It wae the knowledge that better organisation was found to appeal only to themore enterprising and intelligent farmers and it was only after many years&apos; trial of the voluntary system that theGovernments of the Irish Free State and Northern Irelandadopted the compulsory systems of marketing which are nowproving so satisfactory.   4.     Alternative methods of farming have been referredto in previous memoranda.   Essentially they imply thedevelopment of the livestock industry in all its branches.This change over was strongly advised by the AgriculturalTribunal/
 Tribunal  and commended by the late Government but such alteration of systems  cannot  succeed without better organisation. That a change of system 1B feasible is shown by the modifications which have taken place in Scottish Agriculture in the past fifty years.     5.    While  the  numbers cf livestock in Scotland as a whole have remained almost stationary,  there being only &amp;% more cattle and lj$ more sheep in  50 years; a great change has taken place in the areas of  production.     In the five great pastoral counties of the Highlands where there  is little arable land the cattle have(decreased by 11% and sheep by 22% while in the remainder of Scotland,  viz.,  in.the arable and mixed farming areas, where arable ; stoekfarming  has been  adopted the cattle have increased &quot;by 11% and the1  Sheep by 19$.   But the statistics of the past 8 years  are  even more  enlightening.    The arable land in Scotland. since  1021 has decreased by 7.3^,  but -     faji)   the total  value  of  the  agricultural output is at least          as great as  before  the  war (prices being equalised,          and much greater if present prices are applied).s-    (b)  The cattle since 1921 have increased by  1,9%, and  the         sheep have increased by&quot;&apos; 13.5%.    (c)  The number of male workers regularly employed upon the         land was 82,100 in 1921 and in 1929 was  82,070  - a         reduction of 30 individuals.    6.   This change in the agricultural economy  has taken  placegradually but more quickly since the war, and as it givesevidence of greater production of livestock, larger total  outputof agricultural produce in money value, and the maintenance  ofemployment, it Is the system  t&amp;at should be encouraged.    7,   For ifa encouragement no tiling is of more importance than better organisation, because, apart from the  potato market,it is mainly the products of this system, via., milk, butter,cheese, meat, wool, poultry and eggs, which suffer most fromunorganised marketing.    Scottish agriculture is ready for changes and for reorganisation.   The Scottish Agricultural OrganisationSociety, with the assistance of the National Farmers1 Union  ofScotland have organised the marketing of milk, wool and eggs, have established a co-operative slaughter house, and are now engagedin organising and setting up a Potato Selling Agency.    8.   The success of these efforts, however, is endangeredby the action of minorities.   The Milk Agency which handles thegreater part of the milk supplies of tho larger towns to thebenefit of the producer, is threatened with ruin by the minority*ho remain outside and secure the full advantages  of priceswithout contributing to the cost of the scheme.    The proposalto form a Potato Selling Agency is being favourably received but&quot;any of those who have been approached have signed contracts toJoin the Agency only on condition that it includes one hundred percent, of the producers.    9.   There Is no means of securing one hundred per cent.representation short of compulsion.   Compulsion has been  exercised                                                             in/
 in other  countries.    Eggs cannot &quot;be exported from Ireland except under statutory grades and designations.   In Canada eggs cannot ta sold inside  the country or exported from it except under standards and grades.    No such regulation of marketing has been imposed upon the British farmer and the Marketing Bill in its present form compels better marketing only on the application of a majority  of producers and on the authority of a Minister.   No milder form of  compulsion could well he imposed.   I am convinced that such compulsory powers are essential if the praise- worthy efforts  of the  more intelligent and enterprising farmers are not to  he rendered useless.     10.  The scope  and purpose of the Marketing Bill hare been described in a  Memorandum submitted by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.    The Bill provides for the compulsion of minorities  under suitable safeguards and for assistance from the Exchequer in the initial stages of the establishment of the Agencies  or Boards.    It is anticipated that in England no great provision need  by made by way of Government loans for the commercial  operations  of the Boards, as the facilities of the Agricultural Credits Act will be available.   In Scotland under existing  laws the Agricultural Credits Act cannot be made use of in the same way and  there may be some difficulty in financing these Boards.   It is  hoped however that the inclusion of all the producers of a  commodity within one agency will be regarded by the Banks as sufficient security for considerable loans.   It is unlikely  that voluntary societies established in Scotland with only partial representation of producers will be financed to any appreciable extent by  the Banks.     11,  If the Cabinet decide to proceed with a Marketing Bill, a course  which  I strongly support, a statement should be  made by the Prime Minister concurrently with the issue of a White Paper, without delay,  and if  possible not later than the end of this month. The knowledge that the Government are prepared to encourage and to assist in the better organisation of marketing by protecting producers from  the destructive action of minorities will  give an immediate stimulus to  the industry and to those in it who are endeavouring to secure co-operation.   The efforts which are beingmade in Scotland to  reorganise the industry are at a critical point. It is hoped that great progress may be made this Autumn but it is generally recognised by farmers that as in other countries, theym&amp;t receive the support of legislation in order to enable them efficiently to  proceed to improve their marketing systems by their own actions.         I therefore  urge very strongly that an announcement shouldbe made by  the  Government in regard to this matter at the earliestpossible  moment.                              WM. ADAKSON.mieh Office,  Whitehall, S.W.1.      6th May, 1930.
