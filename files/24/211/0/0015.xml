  [THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN!C MAJESTY&apos;S                       GOVERNMENT ] .,Secret.                                            Copy; NoC.p.  115 ,(30),.        C . A g I  N E T.            The  creation of new Authorities f or. Slementary            Education under the Local Government Act,  1929.MElvlORAlTDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION     1.   I wish to draw the attention  of my  colleagues tothe fact that the operation of the Local Government Act may,unless legislative steps are taken to prevent  it,  result  inthe creation of a number of new  local authorities  forelementary education.     2.   The Education Act, 1921, constitutes.the councilof a county or county borough the local education  authorityfor both elementary and higher education, except that thecouncil of a borough with a population  of over 10,000 or  thecouncil of an urban district with a population of  over20,000, according to the. 1901 census, is the local educationauthority for elementary education, commonly known as a&quot;Part III.. Authority&quot;, since Part III. of the Education Act, ,1902, deals exclusively with elementary education.     3.   Section 46 of the Local Government Act,  1929,requires county councils, in. consultation with, the variousparishes, and districts, concerned, to. review: the circumstancesof their, area,  and where desirable, to make proposals to theMinister of Health with regard to amalgamating, changing the boundaries,  or altering the status of parishes or  districts,including,  for certain purposes,  non-county- boroughs;  and,;                            -1-
under the same Seotion the Minister of Health may make anOrder giving effect to these proposals.     4.   if the total population, according to the 1901census, of the area of a borough  or urban district enlargedby an Order made under Section 46 of the Local government act exceeds the 10,000 or So,000  figure given above,  the enlarged area automatically becomes, under the education act, a Part III. local education authority.     5.   I am assured, that at no time did the promoters ofthe Local Government Act foresee  or desire an increase in thenumber of part III. Education Authorities, though they didintend to encourage the creation  of larger units of localgovernment for other purpbseB.     6.   Representations have been made to the Minister ofHealth and myself by the County Councils Association and by individual county councils pointing out the grave disadvantageto education if more of these small authorities for elementary education are created;  indeed several county councils are atthe present moment prevented from planning suitableeducational re-organisation over large parts of their areabecause of uncertainty as to what districts will remain within their jurisdiction.     7.   It is clear that the Minister of Health could notrefrain from making an Order,  desirable on other grounds,solely because such an Order would automatically create a  neweducation authority.      County Councils are thus  placed in adilemma.    Either they must refrain from proceeding with there-arrangement  of districts which is desirable  on  groundsother than educational;   or they must  submit to the automatic
creation of a disastrous number of new and small educationauthorities.   The only way out of the difficulty islegislation.     8.   I have spoken to both Mr. Neville Chamberlain andLord Eustace Percy on the matter and they agree that thecreation of new part III Authorities would be deplorable,and. the former is prepared to put down a friendly question on the matter in the following terms :-         &quot;To ask the President of the Board of Education,     whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that,     in the absence of further legislation, orders by the     Minister of Health under Section 46 of the Local     Government Act, 1929, may result in the creation of a     series of new part III. Education Authorities;  and     whether he proposes to introduce legislation in order     to obviate such a result, which was not intended when     the Act of 1929 was framed&quot;.     9.   The matter is urgent because the dilemma in whichCounty Councils are placed is holding up both the re-arrangement of districts under the Local Government Act and educational reorganisation.   I propose, therefore, inconsultation with the Minister of Health,  to prepare thenecessary legislation for introduction in the coming autumn session, and wish to be able to announce the fact in replyto the question by Mr. Neville Chamberlain.                                     C.T.3rd April 1930.
