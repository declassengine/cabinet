The______Ind ia.n_._Cg nf e r enc e.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.Existing Policy.          British Constitutional policy in India was laiddown in the Preamble to the Government of India Act 1919in the following terms:-          &quot;WHEREAS it is the declared policy of     Parliament to provide for the increasing     association of&quot;Indians in every branch of     Indian administration, and for&quot;the gradual     development of self-governing institutions,     with a view to the progressive realisation     of responsible government in British Ind ia as     an integral part of the Empire;          And whereas progress in giving effect to     this policy can only^be achieved by successive     stages, and it is expedient that substantial     steps in this direction should now be taken;          Ind whereas the time and manner of each     advance &quot;can be determined only by Parliament,     upon whom responsibility lies for the welfare     and advancement of the Indian peoples;          And whereas the action of Parliament in     such matters must be guided by the co-operation     received from those on whom new opportunities     of service will be conferred, and&quot;by the extent     to which it is found that confidence can be     reposed in their sense of responsibility;          ind whereas concurrently with the gradual     development of self-governing institutions in     the Provinces of India it is expedient to five     to those Provinces in provincial matters the     largest measure of independence  of the  Government     of India, which is compatible with the  due discussed-     cbarge by the latter of its own responsibilities&quot;to which must be added the following words in theViceroy&apos;s Statement of November 1st,  1929s&quot;          &quot;I am authorised on behalf  of His  Majesty&apos;s     Government to state clearly that in their     judgment it is implicit in the declaration of     1917 that the natural issue of India&apos;sCopy No. 50
    constitutional progress,  as there  contemplated,    is the attainment of Dominion Status.&quot;         Section 84-A of the  Government  of  India Actreads as follows.-     (1) Within ten years after the passing of theGovernment of India Act I919 the Secretary ofState, with the concurrence of both Houses of Parliament,shall submit for the approval of His Majesty the names of persons to act&quot;as a commission for thepurposes of this section.     (2) The parsons whose names are so submitted,if approved by His Majesty, shall be a commission for the purpose of inquiring into the working ofthe system of government, trie growth of education and trie development of representative institutions,in British India, and matters connected therewith,and the commission shall report as to whether andto what extent it is desirable to establish theprinciple of responsible.government, or to extend,  modifyor restrict the degree of^responsible governmentthen existing therein, including the question whetherthe establishment of second chambers o&apos;f the locallegislatures is or is not desirable.     (3) The commission  shall also inquire into and report on any other matter affecting british india and the provinces, which may be referred tothe commission by His Majesty.          The Simon Commission was appointed under  thisSection in 1927.The Conference.          Indians who objected to an all-white  statutory commission have  for long asked for what they call  a  RoundTable Conference and after consideration,  includingdiscussions between Sir John Simon and the Viceroy inthe Spring of last year,&apos;the Cabinet decided to authorisevarious announcements from which the following are the relevant extractsi-   liceroy&apos;s Announcement, 1st November 1929.    &quot;When, therefore, the Commission and theIndian Central Committee have submitted their reports and these have been published, and
when His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able,in consultation with the Government of India, toconsider these matters in the light of all thematerial then available, they will propose to invite representatives of different&quot;parties and interests in British India and representatives ofthe Indian States to meet them, separately ortogether as circumstances may demand,or thepurpose of conference and discussion in regardboth to the British-Indian and the all-Indian robiems.  It will be their earnest hope that by his means it may subsequentlyiprove possible on these grave issues to submit proposals to Parliament which may command a wide measure ofgeneral assent.&quot;Letter from P.		rime Minister to25to%]	:o&quot;	    &quot;His Majesty5s Government are also greatlyconcerned to find means by which they may approach the.treatment of the broad question of British-Indian constitutional advance in co-operationwith all those who can authoritatively speak forBritish-Indian political opinion.  It seems tothem that both these objects can best beachieved by the adoption of procedure that will permit the&quot;free representation of all points ofview, in advance of the stage at which HisMajesty&apos;s Government will lay any proposals before Parliament, which mav be expected later,as you point out, to form the subject of examination by a Joint Parliamentary Committee.When, therefore, your Commission has submittedits Report and His Majesty&apos;s Government havebeen able, in consultation with the Government ofIndia, to consider these matters in the light ofall the material then available, they will proposeto invite representatives of different parties and interests in&quot;British India and representativesof the Indian States to meet them,  separatelyor together, as circumstances may demand,-forthe purpose of conference and discmssion inregard both to the British-Indian and Ill-Indianproblems.&quot;Viceroy&apos;sAddresfs to Legislative  AssemblyJanuary..desire that His Majesty&apos;s Government far    &quot;The only have will be&quot; that this body should, soas possible, be honestly and fairlyrepresentative of all opinion in Indialegitimately claim to be heard ...  .takinar part in the proceedings will be free^o advocate any proposals for the realisation of Great Britain&apos;s professed policy that they may desire to advance.&quot;     They wi1&apos;which can Thosecompletely  polii  will
       do this .  ...  in the light of all  the material       then available,  a definition purposely drawn       wide enough to ensure to  the Conference every       latitude and assistance  in the responsible task       in which it will be  engaged.&quot;           The sentences quoted,  which were based upon the Cabinet decision,  constitute all that has been said up to the present as to  the  character  of the Conference.   What the Cabinet has  now  to decide  is whether more specific instructions or  terms  of reference  are to be given to the Conference and,  if so,  what they are to be.           The following are the  opposed views.  On the one hand there are those who think that, whether it is stated in terms or  not,  the  purpose  of the Conference is to work on the lines of the  Simon Report, making suggestions and comments. In  fact,  the Conference would be rather of the character oi&quot; the Joint Parliamentary Committee which was contemplated in the earlier  plans.   On the  other side are those who demand that the  Conference  should, in the event of its reaching agreement  among  all elements in  India,  draft a Constitution if possible  to  be put through  Parliament as drafted.    Between these  two  extremes is  to be found the right course to be pursued. Bearing unon Personnel  of the Conference.          But before touching that question there  is amatter of great, though lesser,  importance to be considered.           (a)  It is desired that the Conference should attract the  attendance  of British  Indians who carry weight and whose views will be accepted by a large body of public opinion in  India.           (b)  It has been  suggested - and the Viceroy is  ofthe  opinion  - that Members  of the Oppositions in Parliament                                             should
should co-operate in the British Delegation.          As to the first point, (a),  I may cite  the         signeddeclaration^ 2nd November last by 30 Indian political leaders, including Congressmen like Mr. Gandhi and the twoNehrus, Liberals like Sir Tej Sapru and such others as Dr.Be sent, Dr. Moonje and the Mahajaja of Mahmudabad.  As tothe purpose of the Conference they use these  words:-          &quot;Some doubt has been expressed about the      interpretation of the paragraph in the      statement made by the Viceroy&quot;on behalf of  His      Majesty&apos;s Government regarding Dominion status.      Tie understand, however, that the Conference is      to meet,  not to discuss when Dominion status  shall      be established, but to frame a scheme of Dominion      constitution for India.  We hope that we are  not      mistaken in thus interpreting the import and      the implication of this weighty pronouncement      of the&quot;Viceroy.&quot;           On the 23rd December, the Viceroy  met  the signatories to  this Manifesto and the interview was reported as follows in the &apos;Times&apos;.-          &quot;To-day&apos;s discussion was limited to the      function oof the proposed Round Table      Conference in London&quot;.  It was pointed out      that members of the Conference would be      free to advocate any proposals they liked,      and that  any measure of unanimity at the      Conference would necessarily carry weight      with British opinion.          The view was expressed on behalf of the      Congress  Partv (represented by Mr. Gandhi      and^Pandit Motilal Nehru) that unless      previous  assurances were given by His Majesty&apos;s      Government that the purpose of the Conference      was to draft a scheme for Dominion status      which His Majesty&apos;s Government would undertake      to support, there would be grave difficulty about      the Congress taking part.          The Viceroy made it plain,that the      Conference was designed to elicit the      greatest  possible measure of agreement  for      the final proposals which it would be the      duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government to submit  to      Parliament, and that it was impossible  for      him or His Majesty&apos;s Government in any way  to      prejudge  the action of the Conference or      restrict  the liberty of Parliament.&quot;
           It  is  clear, therefore, that, although some of the signatories to &quot;/this Manifesto do hot regard its terms as pre- requisite  conditions  of attendances the Manifesto affords them all an opportunity,  should they desire it, to boycott the Conference.  As we know, this course was taken by the Congress signatories when they entered at Lahore on the present campaign of Civil Disobedience.           As  to  (by,  i.e. the participation of Opposition Parties;   although it is  a fact that the  Conference is free that is to say it will meet and deliberate before HisMajesty&apos;s  Government have formulated any proposals, if its scope  is made too wide or its powers too great, it may be that members  of  the two Oppositions will refuse to co-ooperate. Terms  of Reference.           Turning again to the question of instructions to the Conference and the purposes of the same, the following questions  and answers are relevant:-           Question.                    Answer. of Brltilloifc^6 6031           ^Minion status.     2. What does this             Equality of status withmean?                            the self-governing Dominions.     3. Is it possible to say when this will be              No. achieved?     4. Why can  no date be      1. Because differences exist fixed?                          among Indians themselves.                                2. Because we have not yet                                 received the  Simon Report,                                 and, until receiving  it,                                 cannot decide what are the                                 other practical obstacles.           It  is  imperative that the purpose and function of the Conference should be  described  in the clearest possible way, so as, not  only  to protect the Government of  India from later  charges of bad  faith,  but also to avoid  the  disturbances                                                   which
which might follow such charges.  Moreover there ismuch to he said for adhering in substance, and indeed inphraseology5 to the statements which have already beenissued.  In the light of the arguments advanced above,  some such announcement as follows might be the best.          1. The goal of the British Government1s policy isthe attainment of Dominion Status by India and theConference is called to assist the Government in considerationof measures towards the achievement of this end.          2. Representatives at the Conference will be completely free to advosate any proposals for thorealisation of Great Britain&apos;s declared policy that theymay desire to. advance.   The deliberations of the conference will take place In the light of all the material available.          3. Though it is impossible to restrict the liberty of Parliament, any measure of unanimity at the conference would necessarily carry weight with the Government and parliament.          The following are Lord  Irwin&apos;s viewss-          &quot;I feel strongly that any attempt to define    terms of reference will lead  to endless    troubles here, and I hope that nothing further    need be said thait to re-quote Simon&apos;s letter    to the Prime Minister.  If the Conference is    really to be free, I do not think we ought to    risk appearance of trying to  restrict it by any^    narrower terms of reference than there contained.&quot;                        (Telegram 26th March 1930).          I submit the above statement for the considerationof the Cabinet, always bearing in mind the real danger that the lack of certain undertakings and definitions inthe instructions to the Conference may be made the  excuse for abstention on the part of some of those whom  it  had                                              hitherto
hitherto been hoped would co-operate.Arrangements -for the Conference.          The arrangements for the Conference will,  ofcourse, be very elaborate and some decision is required as to meeting the cost.                             whB.2nd May 1930.
