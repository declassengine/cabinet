COMPOSITION  AND TEEMS  OF  REFERENCE.    AT a meeting held on the 14th November, 1929, the Cabinet directed* that acommittee should be set up, composed of     Brigadier-General the Rt. Hon. Lord Thomson, C.B.E., D.S.O., Secretary of        State for Air (Chairman),    Mr. H. B. Lees Smith, M.P., Postmaster-General,    Mr. F. W.

Hodsoll,  Committee of  Imperial  Defence                (Secretary),and with the following terms  of reference :         &quot; To examine the whole problem, as set out by the Postmaster-General in    his Memorandum, Paper No. CP; 311  (29), as to whether the Wireless    Telephony services, which, in accordance with the recommendation of the    Imperial Wireless Conference of 1928, were retained in  the  hands of the    Government, should be operated through the medium of the Post Office Wireless    Station at Rugby or through the Beam Telegraph Stations which were leased to    Imperial and International Communications, Ltd.; and to report to the Cabinet    on the question of policy  involved therein.&quot;* Cabinet 48 (29), Conclusion 7.,[20612]
      .                     SHORT  HISTORICAL NOTE.    1.  It will be remembered that,  in 1928, a Conference, known as &quot; The Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference,&quot; was set up with the following terms of reference:          &quot; To examine the situation which has arisen as a result of the  Competition    of the Beam Wireless with the Cable services,  to report thereon, and to make    recommendations with a view to a common  policy being adopted by the various    Governments concerned.&quot;*    2.  The Conference recommended, and the  late Government adopted its recom-mendation,!  that  the Beam Telegraph  services (together with  the  Pacific and imperial Cables) should  be  transferred to a company formed by  a  merger of  the marconi Company and the  Eastern  Group of  Cable  Companies.   The  MergerCompany is  known  as Cables  and Wireless, Limited,  and there is a subsidiarycompany,  responsible for communication services only,  registered  as Imperial and international Communications, Limited.    3.  iln  making  these recommendations, however,  the Conference  expresslyexcluded the transfer of  the wireless  telephony  services,  which were left in  thepontrol of the Post Office.  Recommendation VIII of the Conference was worded asfollows : telep!on w&quot;The Post Office in London will reserve the right to conduct the external        )honic services of Great Britain, but will agree with the Company the terms        which it will have the right to use the Company&apos;s wireless stations or portions    thereof for telephonic purposes.&quot;    4.  Eventually the late  Government adopted, as a  definite  policy,  that  the wireless telephone services in Great Britain should  be reserved  for  Governmentoperation and control under the General Post Office.    This decision,  as  also Recommendation  VIII of the Conference,  was com-municated to the Merger Company, and a principal issue on which the Committeewas called upon to report was the  interpretation put upon Recommendation VIII bythe representatives of that Company.    5.  The Company argued that Recommendation VIII implied that their stations would be used  by the  Post Office as the channel for overseas  telephone services,provided reasonable financial and other arrangements could be made.    The Committee was informed, on the other hand,, that this recommendation wasinserted at the request of the Post Office, and with the  authority of  the late Cabinet,to meet the possible contingency  that the Beam stations would  be able to providetelephone services to the Dominions which could  not be  worked,  or could not  be worked so efficiently, from Rugby.   It was expressly  designed to secure that, as acondition of the transfer of the telegraph services, the Company should  agree to theuse of their stations for telephone services, if they were so required, on reasonableterms, and should not be left in a position to exact a monopolistic  rental.    6.  The second paragraph in the  Imperial Conference^ Report, on which  theCompany relied, is as follows (paragraph 44) :-        &quot; The full benefits of the scheme can only be  secured by the whole-hearted    co-operation on the part of  all the Governments  concerned, and of the under-    takings conducting telegraphic communications throughout  the  Empire.  The    establishment or authorisation  of  services within the  Empire, which work  in    opposition to, or, indeed,  out of harmony with, the above scheme, would deprive    it of much of its value, and would militate  against the objects which we have    endeavoured to attain.&quot;    7.  This paragraph is not concerned with the question of telephony, but relates to the co-operation of the Governments and undertakings concerned in the Imperial                           * I.W.C. (28) 75, paragraph 1.                           t CP. 135 (28), paragraph 5 (1).                           % I.W.C. (28) 75, paragraph 15.r,       .     .............................     ....
telegraph services.  It will be noticed that telegraphic communication is expresslyreferred to, and the conclusion of the same paragraph, which runs as follows, makesthis even more clear :-         &quot; .  .  . .  We recommend, therefore, that, if our proposals commend them-    selves to the Governments of the several parts of the Empire, they should take    steps to apply  the principles of the scheme, with such modifications in points    of detail as may be necessary to meet local conditions, to the overseas telegraphic    undertakings operating within their jurisdiction.&quot;Meetings Held.    8.  We held our first meeting on Tuesday, the 19th November, 1929, and decided,in the first instance, to invite Sir Basil Blackett and any other representative ofImperial and International  Communications,  Limited,  whom he might wish tobring, to attend  and give evidence  in support of the cLaims of the Company to operate, from their Beam stations, the wireless telephony services.    9.  We recognised that, whatever the final decision, His Majesty&apos;s governments in the Dominions would be interested, and we arranged, therefore, with the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and  the  Colonies  to furnish a memorandum inexplanation of any Dominion interests involved.    10.  We also took the precaution of consulting the Imperial communications committee on the strategical aspect of this question, and the views of this Committeeare submitted in the appropriate section of this report.    11.  We have held eight meetings in all.  A list of  persons who have attendedthese meetings, either as witnesses or in an advisory capacity, or who have been con-suited, is attached as Appendix A.                                    i  I. THE CLAIMS OF IMPERIAL AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS, LIMITED.    12.  The Company&apos;s claim is founded upon four principal grounds :     (1) That there  is some moral obligation on the Government to co-operate  with          the Company by using their  stations;    (2) That the Beam stations will give a more efficient service than can be provided          by any other means at present known;    (3) That the Beam stations  will be more economical;    (4) That  their use  will enhance the Company&apos;s  prestige  and assist  it in          competing with its American rivals for foreign concessions.    13.  The  first  claim is primarily  based upon Recommendation  VIII  and paragraph 44 of the report of the Imperial Wireless Conference of 1928,  reference has already been made to these in paragraphs 3-7.    14.  In the light of these explanations, we think the Company&apos;s claim that aright  to use the  stations is equivalent to  an obligation  to  use them  is clearlymisconceived, and we are satisfied that there is no substance  in the argument thatthe Government is under any obligation, moral or otherwise, to utilise the Company&apos;sstations. In our view, it is free to provide  Imperial  telephone services by  suchmethods, and through such stations,  as it considers expedient.    15.  The Company&apos;s representatives stated that, in the, course of negotiations between the  Post Office and the Company in  February 1929, an undertaking wasgiven  by the  Secretary to the Post Office that that Department would co-operate withthe Company with  a view to  the  development of  the best  overseas telephonicapparatus, without prejudice to its ultimate use; and would agree not to place orders,for  a  period of six months,  for new  apparatus for Dominion telephony.    TheCompany argued that they were justified in assuming, from this undertaking, thatthe Beam stations would be used, provided an  efficient service could be given at theend of the six months&apos; period and that the financial terms asked by the company were not unreasonable.    16.  We are informed that, during the course of these negotiations,  no under-taking, express or implied, was  given to  utilise the Company&apos;s stations.  It wasintimated to the Company that,  while the Postmaster-General was willing to agree
 not to order further apparatus for Dominion services for six months, he desired to leave the question  as  to whether the  Company&apos;s stations or some  other means of transmission should be employed, absolutely open for decision on its merits when the provision of telephone services to the Dominions became a practical possibility.  The Post Office have also informed us that the undertaking not to order apparatus for the Dominion services for six months was  strictly observed,  and that, in fact, no order has been placed for this purpose from that day to this. Conclusion.     We think it is evident that the late Postmaster-General&apos;s policy was  to  keep himself free from any previous commitinent, so that the merits of both systems could be impartially weighed when the time  for taking a decision arrived. IT-A GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE  POLICY  OF IMPERIAL  AND  INTERNATIONAL             COMMUNICATIONS, LIMITED,  vis-a-vis THE POST OFFICE.    17.  The Company contended that they should  be regarded not merely  as  a commercial undertaking trading for profit, but as a public utility company charged with the duty of maintaining  and co-ordinating telegraphic communications within the Empire, and working under Government supervision,  through the medium of the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee.   They pointed out that their profits were limited by the operation of  their agreements with the Government and that their Chairman, and  one  other member of the Board, were  subject to Government approval; and they urged that, by reason of their exceptional position, the Govern-ment should view their application for the telephonic use of the Beam stations from the broad standpoint of Imperial  policy.    18.  From this contention the Company deduced that their aims and the  aims of the  Post Office were identic, and that these aims were the development, to the fullest extent and as expeditiously  as possible,  of  a thoroughly efficient wireless telephony service, firstly within the Empire and  secondly outside it.   And further, that this service should be  developed by British enterprise.    19.  The Company went on  to assert that they did not  desire,  in any  way, to interfere with  the Post Office&apos;s monopoly of the internal telephone system of thiscountry,  but they felt that only  by the very closest co-operation and collaboration between  themselves and the  Post Office could British enterprise be  fostered andforeign competition defeated.    20.  We agree that the special position which the Company occupies gives it a title to Government support  and, as  a British undertaking, it would naturallyreceive such diplomatic assistance as the British Government can give in negotiatingfor concessions in foreign countries.  But we do not think that, in framing an organisation for its own telephone services, the  Government would be justified inrejecting a  system which  offers superior advantages, from a technical or financialstandpoint,  merely in  order to strengthen the Company&apos;s prestige abroad.    21.  The Company urged that, if the Beam stations in this  country were notutilised for telephone services, it would be necessary for the complementary Beamstations in the Dominions to be duplicated at a heavy and unnecessary expense.    22.  We are informed that the Rugby station can work telephonically, without difficulty, with the Beam stations in  the Dominions, which  it will therefore be unnecessary to duplicate;  and that the Post Office is prepared to operate with anyagency in the Dominions which is able  to give access to the telephone subscribers inits territory.    23.  The control of the telephone service, whether internal or external,  in each Dominion,  rests entirely with  the  Government concerned which is free to license acommercial company or to retain the service in its own hands.  We are satisfied thatthe Dominion Governments would not be fettered  by a decision to utilise Rugby andthat it  would not entail the duplication of any of the existing Beam stations.   If theDominion Governments decide to erect separate stations it will  be for other reasons,e.g., that the Beam station is not conveniently situated for telephonic communicationwith the principal centres  of population.
Conclusion.    24.   The Company stated that, in certain cases, it might be expedient to conducta service through a relay station instead of by direct communication, and that thePost Office could only obtain the use of the  Dominion stations for relaying purposesby agreement with the Company.    It is acknowledged that, in certain instances, and at certain times, the use ofrelay stations may be found more efficient, or more economic, than direct communica-tion, but the Post Office stated that it was unnecessary,  for this purpose, to employthe Company as their agents in this country;  arrangements could and would, in thenormal course, be made with the authority owning and operating the relay station.III. COMPARISON BETWEEN  THE  TECHNICAL  ASPECTS  OF THE Two  SYSTEMS OF                               COMMUNICATIONS.    25.  The  Committee next considered the relative efficiency of the alternativesystems.  They found general acceptance of the  principle that, apart from north america, long-distance services to the Dominions and  foreign countries,  outside europe, will have to be operated on short waves;  firstly, because the power requiredto maintain services exceeding about 2,000 miles in length makes  the  long waveuneconomical;  and,  secondly,  because  the  long wave  is  more  susceptible toatmospheric disturbance in tropical latitudes.  Moreover,  even if these  difficultiescould be surmounted, the Dominions would not be  prepared to incur the considerably higher outlay which a long-wave station entails.    26.  It may be explained that the principal  difference between the Post Officesystem and the Marconi system is that the latter uses a large directive aerial system with a transmitter of lower power, while  the Post Office uses a small directive aerialsystem with a transmitter of higher power.  The  Company attach great importanceto the large aerial system; the Marchese Marconi argued that it concentrated, inthe required  direction,  a far greater proportion of  the energy radiated,  with a consequential  reduction in the liability  to  possible interference, and that it  was virtually indispensable.  He  also  claimed  that, although the  large  aerial  was regarded with scepticism in many quarters, its success had been proved  by  actualexperience.  A lengthy  document,  in support  of  this  conclusion, was submitted bythe Marchese  Marconi, and  is to be found on pages 25-31  of Appendix B  and appendix C.   (The oral evidence given by, the Company has also been included as appendix B.)    27.  The Post Office engineers, on the other hand, contend that the lower powerproduced by the small aerial system is more than  compensated  by the high power ofthe transmitter, which gives a superior overall  efficiency as compared  with the marconi  system.    It was also urged by the Post Office experts that the Rugby system, owing to itssmaller aerial  and  lower masts, gave much more flexibility.  They claimed that theseveral services could be grouped at Rugby,  so that each transmitter could be used at different hours for two, or, with minor services, even three,  lines of communica-tion, and that  two, or, if necessary, three, alternative wavelengths could be provided at relatively small additional cost, thus enabling communication to be maintained on one wavelength, when  the other  would not  give conversations of a  commercialstandard.   This statement would,  no doubt,  be  hotly contested by the  MarcheseMarconi, who  quoted, in defence of his thesis, the following eminent authorities on commercial Wireless operation :     M. Girardeau: Director of the Compagnie Geherale de Telegraphie Sans Fils.    Graf von Arco  and Dr.  Schapira:  Director and Managing Director of the        Telefunken  Gesellschaft fur Drahtlose Telegraphie m.b.H.Berlin.    Mr.  David  Sarnoff:   Vice-President  and  General  Manager  of  the Radio        Corporation of America.    28.  In view of the highly technical nature of  the  issues involved, and the conflicting opinions which were submitted to us upon them, we thought it  advisable to obtain the advice of two independent scientific experts of established  repute;  andwe accordingly consulted Dr. F. E.  Smith, Secretary of the Royal Society and of theDepartment of Scientific and  Industrial  Research, and Professor G. W. O. Howe,    2M-
Professor of Engineering at Glasgow University and, until recently, a member of the radio Research Board.  A copy of the letter addressed to them, and of their reply,is printed in Appendices F and G.     29.  We  think the report of Dr. Smith  and Professor Howe may  fairly besummarised as follows : -     (a) That  it is  immaterial, from the restricted point of view of signal strength           at the receiver, whether  this  is obtained by increasing the  power output           of the transmitting apparatus, or by increasing the concentration of a           smaller  available power by using a more efficient directive  aerial  system.               In other words, so far as the present is concerned, both the Marconi           and the Post Office systems  are probably  equally capable of providing           satisfactory telephonic communication.  As regards  the  future,  it is           considered  that the adoption of the more elastic aerial system, that  is,           with lower masts, would be advantageous, because of the smaller  capital           outlay required. This means that the Post Office aerial system, which is           carried on lower masts than the Marconi Beam system,  could probably be           made more effective than the  Marconi array at lower capital cost.     (b) That  there is no  reason  why the Multiplex system,  as  employed  by the           Marconi Company,  need produce  interference,  although it  has been           known to do so.     (c) That  the  development  of  single  side-band transmission  is  of  great           importance, and research should be encouraged in this direction, as being           likely,  not only to improve  efficiency,  but also, to make possible the           employment  of  devices for  providing  secrecy  in  radio  telephonic           communications.Conclusion.     30.  In view  of  the opinions of  the scientific experts, we have come  to theconclusion  that,  on  technical grounds,  the  Post  Office  system  of  telephoniccommunication through  Rugby is at least as efficient as  the Marconi system andoffers greater possibilities of economic development in the future. We consider, also,that the Post Office system gives greater elasticity;  in  particular, by the working ofmore than one service from each transmitter at different times of the day.IV. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL  IMPLICATIONS OF  THE Two  SYSTEMS.    31.  In  response  to a request  for  a  definite  financial  offer,  the  Companysubmitted to  the Committee three alternative proposals, which may be summarisedas follows; full details are given in Appendices C and&apos; D : Multiplex, using a band of 13,000 cycles with one channel for telegraphy    and one for telephony.Average hours service per diem, for the whole year-Hours.CanadaSouth AfricaIndiaAustralia  ...13191913Organisation-

The  estimated income per         annum, on the basis of proposal No. 1, would be as follows :                                                                             To the Company    ...       ...       ...     40,200             To the Post Office   ...       ...       ...     31,800                                  (c.)

     Financial Arrangements        &apos;  Imperial and International Communications, Limited, to receive  38,000*             per annum, plus 10 per cent, of the gross British receipts, with a             combined minimum of  45,000 per annum.                 The estimated income per annum, on the basis of proposal No. 1,             would be as follows                                                                                   To the Company    ...       ...       ...    45,200                 To the Post Office   ...       ...       ...    26,800     32.   To obtain an accurate basis of comparison with the cost of operating thesame services from Rugby, it  is necessary to add, in each case, the cost of the landline connexions between&apos; the wireless  stations  and  the  London trunk  exchange.  \According to the Post Office estimate, the land lines required for the Beam stations would represent a capital investment  of   266,000,  entailing annual charges for interest, depreciation and maintenance of  20,800.  On the same basis, the land linesrequired for Rugby would represent a capital investment of  64,300 and annualcharges of  5,300. &apos;     33.  The much lower cost of the land lines needed at Rugby is attributable to two factors :      (a); The concentration of the services at one centre admits of  their being worked           with a smaller number of lines.                                       .  j     (b) Rugby and  Baldock are much nearer London than the Beam stations, and           the land lines will therefore  be shorter and proportionately cheaper, both           in capital and maintenance charges.     34.&apos; The following  are the chief additional points  made by the  Company in  i:support of their proposals :       (a) They entail no capital expenditure on  the part of the Post Office, except in           the  provision of the  necessary  land-lines  and the installation, at the           Central Telephone Office in London, of the land-line  linking devices.     (&amp;) The remuneration proposed  to the Company covers interest on capital           expenditure plus depreciation, and  the running costs for operating and           maintaining the transmitting and receiving stations.     (c) For any development  beyond the 20 three-minute calls per circuit for 300           days per year, the  Post Office income  will  increase in  far greater           proportion to that  of the Company, t     (d) If necessary, the Company will be prepared, on suitable  terms, to add such  I           additional channels as the services may require.     (e) - The Post Office will retain the right to fix the scale of charges to be raised           for the service and to alter or amend these rates as they think fit.     35.  The Post  Office have  supplied  us with  a  detailed estimate, printed  inAppendix E, of the cost of conducting the  services with  India,  Canada,  Australia  jand South  Africa, through the Rugby  and Baldock  stations.   According to this  \estimate,- the additional capital expenditure, exclusive of land lines, would amount  jto  120,000, and the cost of working, exclusive of costs common both  to Rugby andthe Beam system, but inclusive of land lines and capital charges, would be  43,000per annum, of which  4,000 would represent existing costs necessarily incurred atRugby and  39,000 would be new charges.     36.  It  should  be mentioned that these figures include staff and equipment which would be  available for other services  to foreign countries.   If these facilities  [were fully utilised, the cost attributable to the Dominion  services would be reduced  fby some  6,000 to  7,000 per annum.     37.  The first and cheapest of  the three alternative proposals submitted by the  f;Company would, we are informed  by the Post Office, be the least satisfactory, on  [various  grounds,  such as interference,  though  this would. be disputed by  the  ICompany.   If the policy of utilising the Beam stations were adopted, the choice  iwould lie between  the second and third proposals.  For purposes of comparison  Iwith the cost of the Rugby system, it would be  necessary to add, to the payments  [    * Note.-There will be an increase  in capital and running costs due to the provision of separate  jjtransmitters.&apos;    t For details see Appendix 0, p. 42.
Ito the  Company,  the  sum  of   20,800 per  annum  in respect of  land  lines,  producing  a  minimum  cost  of   60,800 and   65,800 respectively.   On  these  figures  the  saving secured by  utilising Rugby  would  be  over  17,000  on the  second  alternative, and over  22,000 on  the third,  even  if the  services were  debited  with their  share of the existing  cost of Rugby and not merely with new  expenditure.  And this saving would be still further increased as soon as the revenue  reached a point at  which additional payments to the Company, by way of  royalty  above the minimum rental, became due.I Conclusion.      38.   We have,  therefore, reached  the conclusion that concentration at Rugby1 oilers substantial economies, which may be estimated at not  less than  20,000 perI annum,  and, in certain contingencies, would be considerably more.      39.   In this connection it is important to note that heavy capital expenditure:  has been incurred by the Government  for the large sites and extensive plant and  buildings at the Rugby and Baldock stations.   The present capital  cost of  these  stations  is  690,000, and the present annual charges (covering interest, depreciation  and working expenses)  amount to  125,000 a year. The wireless telegraph  service  conducted at the Rugby station has always been held to be strategically necessary,  but it is  run at a loss; on the other hand, the wireless telephone service,  for which the  station  is also used,  is remunerative.   The  Rugby  and  Baldock  stations  can  accommodate  additional services; and  the concentration at those  stations of new  wireless  telephone services  is an economical arrangement, since it will  spread the  overhead costs more widely and will enable the large capital already invested in the! stations  to be more fully and profitably used.                V. THE  QUESTION OF  RADIO-ELECTRIC RESEARCH.     40.   This question, though in a sense a side issue, having been specifically raised  by the Company,  we considered  it necessary that some reference to it should be  included in our report.  Briefly, the Company claim that great benefits have already  accrued  through their work on this subject, by reason of the unification of radio-  electric research, pure and applied, and its correlation with research in connection  Avith the manufacture and operation of submarine cables.     41.   The Company attached great importance, not only to the unification and  extension of research work in this sphere,  out to co-ordination generally within the  Empire,  and it was in this latter field  that the Company alleged there  were grave  shortcomings.  It was contended that no co-operation existed, in reality, between the  largest factor in British radio-electric research the Company and other interested  concerns, notably the Radio Research Board.     42.   The Company appeared to  think that, while the Post Office was in close  touch with the American Telegraph and Telephone Corporation in regard to wireless  developments, there was a tendency to ignore British efforts, and that it was of high  importance to all concerned that British research should be encouraged and collated  if a determined, and successful effort, was to be made to combat the ever-increasing  menace of foreign competition.     43.   Finally,  the Company stated  that the research work in radio-telephony  which had been carried out by the Marchese Marconi and his assistants, had been  done principally on the assumption that co-operation with the British Government,  in solving the problem of Imperial telephonic communications, would be forthcoming.  Failing this, it  would be necessary for the centre of this research work, both as  regards radio-telephony and radio-telegraphy since the two are inseparable to be  transferred  abroad,  where it could count on the sympathetic  co-operation of other  Governments to whom the Company is already under contract.     44.  Regarding the  alleged  co-operation between the Post  Office and the  American competitors of the Company, we are informed that this is true only so far  as concerns the use by the Post Office, for reasons which are given in  the following  section, of certain apparatus of American design and manufacture.  Conclusion.  . ;     /    . 45.  It is agreed generally that, in principle, close co-operation  between the Post Office and British commercial undertakings is  desirable.       [20612]                                                        c 2
                  VI. THE MENAGE OF FOREIGN COMPETITION.    46.  The Company laid  great stress on  the difficulties; with which  they are confronted in the field  of foreign competition, which, in effect,. means Americancompetition.* They point out that they are faced with this competition not only onthe communications side, but on the business or production side as well, and that the amalgamation of cables and wireless throughout the  Empire was only an effort to rationalise the business of British radio-electric communications and to help  it tomeet foreign competition.    47.  The Company stated further, that the close association of the Post office with American-owned companies in this country Standard Telephones and Cables,Limited had tended to the purchase  of American equipment  in preference toBritish, with the result that the stations at Rugby and Baldock had a considerable proportion of American apparatus, which gave an unfortunate impression to foreignvisitors and which reacted unfavourably on the trade of Imperial and InternationalCommunications, Limited.  Continuing,  the  Company pointed out that they  have accepted  serious liabilities as  regards strategic cables, the  employment  only ofBritish personnel, &amp;c, and that they were, in consequence, entitled to every support from His Majesty&apos;s Government.    48.  Finally,  the Company suggested that, if they were excluded  from  allparticipation in wireless telephony in this country, there was no British organisation which  could take  their place  in the provision  of wireless telephony  servicesthroughout the  Empire.  The Post Office, it was stated,  could not operate outsidethe United Kingdom, and  if Imperial and International Communications, Limited,were restrained from taking  the part they wish to play, then the  inevitable result would be the introduction of foreign elements.    49.  The Post Office pointed out that, in operating  a telephone service, it wasnecessary to collaborate with the company or other organisation controlling the otherterminal,  and that they have been necessarily brought  into close association with theAmerican  Telegraph and  Telephone Company through the working of the  Anglo-American service.  They informed us that their usual practice is to invite competi-tive tenders from the Marconi Company and  the Standard Company and to selectwhichever tender is preferable from the point of  view of  price  and  technical efficiency;  that  British manufacture is  preferred, and  that where the  StandardCompany have obtained an order it is because their product was superior in design and slightly lower in price. It was further pointed out that the Standard company is a British registered company, with works on the outskirts of London, and that itwould constitute an entirely new departure to rule out a firm manufacturing in GreatBritain and employing British labour, on  the ground that it  was  financed  by american capital.Conclusion.    50.  We  understand  that, apart  from  other  considerations,  the Post office would be anxious to place orders with the. Company in order to widen the sources ofsupply, and that they have offered to discuss  the details of their specifications withthe Company5s engineers should the latter so desire.  We know of no reason why theCompany should  not be  able to compete, on equal terms,  with any other  firmmanufacturing in this country, and we hope, in future, that their technicians will beable to satisfy Post Office requirements.    * Note. The question of meeting- American  competition within the Empire has been frequently beforethe  Imperial  Communications Committee a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   It is admitted  that, there is a  distinct menace to the security of our Imperial communications, strategicallyspeaking, since American  ramifications are world-wide and are  backed by what  is  apparently unlimitedcapital.
         VII. EFFECT ON DOMINIONS AND  STRATEGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.Conclusion.    51.  We have obtained from the Dominions Office a note of the present positionas regards long-distance telephone services in each Dominion, which will be foundin Appendix II. As we have already pointed out, the use of the Rugby and Baldockstations will not entail the provision of separate stations  in the Dominions if theBeam stations are  conveniently situated, and the authority concerned desires to use them; nor will it fetter the discretion of the Dominion Governments either to retainthese services in their own hands or to license commercial companies to operate them.    52.  Although not included in their terms of reference, the Committee felt itnecessary to examine the bearing of the two schemes on National Defence.   Whileit is the recorded  opinion  of the Committee of Imperial Defence that the  absenceof secrecy would at present be a bar to the use of wireless telephony for Governmentpurposes in time of war, there is reason to  believe  that various secrecy devices areat present passing through the experimental stage, whose development does not,  atpresent, provide sufficient data for definite conclusions.  We directed our attention,therefore, to the immediate question of vulnerability to air attack.    In this latter  connection, it was pointed out by the Imperial communications committee that the dispersal of wireless stations presented advantages.   On theother hand, a place like Rugby, in the centre of England, is more difficult to locatefrom the air than stations like  Grimsby and Skegness,  which are situated on thecoast.Conclusion.    For  this reason we  are  of the opinion that concentration at Rugby  involves no special risks.  The memorandum forwarded to us by the Imperial communications committee is attached as Appendix J.                             VIII. CONCLUSIONS.The Claim of I. and I.  C. to operate the Wireless Telephone Services.    53.  The first point to  which our attention was  directed  was the claim  ofImperial and International  Communications,  Limited (referred  to  in subsequentparagraphs as  the I.  and I. C.) that they have some  moral right  to operate the wireless Telephony Services emanating from  Great Britain.   While recognising that this claim was put forward in good faith,  the Committee are of  opinion that itis based on a misapprehension, and can in no way be substantiated.    54.  Our next step was to compare the systems for operating Wireless Telephonyservices advocated-by the Post Office and I. and I. C. respectively.  The chief bases of comparison were              (a) Their technical merits.             (b) Their financial implications.Technical Merits of the Two Schemes.            &apos;                  &apos;    In regard  to  (a), after hearing  the  expert advisers of the Post  Office  and therepresentatives of  the  I. and I. C. (including  the Marchese Marconi himself, whosubmitted  several  written statements), we  realised that we  were not competent,without further advice, to express an opinion on the technical points involved.  We,therefore, consulted two independent experts, Dr. F. E.  Smith and Professor Howe,whose  joint report is  given  in  Appendix G.   From  this report we reached theconclusion that the Post Office system is at least as efficient,  for present purposes,  asthat employed by  the  I. and I. O; that it has the further distinct advantage  ofproviding greater flexibility through its equipment, and that it can be more readilyadapted  to new i  developments. and  inventions.   In  this latter connection, theCommittee feel that it is only fair to the I. and I.  C.  to recognise the value of the research work it has carried out, more especially that of Marchese  Marconi.  Forthis reason the Committee  feel that any possible co-operation between the research department of the Post Office and the I. and I. C. would be in the public interest.
Financial Implications of the two Schemes.    As regards (b), we find that, for the purpose of working  four Dominion services under the proposals of the Post Office, the annual charges are estimated to amountto  39,000, exclusive of costs common to both  systems.   These charges includedepreciation, costs  of maintenance, land lines, and  interest on the  capital outlayinvolved, which is estimated to amount to some  120,000, which would be providedout of loans authorised by the Post Office money acts.    Proposal 2 of  the  Imperial and International  Communications Company, asset out in  Appendix C, would cost the State  60,800  per annum.  This  sum isreached by adding to the Company &apos;s figure the annual cost of land lines charged onthe standard Post Office basis.  It will be seen that  the  difference in favour of thePost Office proposal amounts to  22,000 per annum.  This difference will be increased in the event of the revenue rising to a point which  would entitle the Company toremuneration above the minimum figure.    We took note of the capital sums already expended  on  the Rugby station, andthe fact that the returns on these are at present negligible.  We were also influenced by the further consideration that, if the  Wireless  Telephony services should be operated from the  I. and  I.  C. Beam Stations,  the situation  at Rugby  could not greatly be improved, and might even deteriorate.    We are satisfied, moreover, that when the Wireless Telephony services come tobe extended as undoubtedly they will be with new inventions- the gain to the publicExchequer will be increased by adopting the Post Office system.Strategical Aspect.    55.  At  our request,  Lord Passfield,  the Chairman  of  the  Imperial  Com-munications Committee, submitted a memorandum on the strategical aspects of thisquestion.   The chief point affecting our decision was the question of vulnerabilityto air attack.  Lord Passfield&apos;s Committee  stated that it was  preferable either to locate the centre, if concentrated, in such a position  as will  lie outside the probableradius of enemy  aircraft or bombardment by enemy war vessels from  the sea; or elseto disperse the stations, thereby decreasing, greatly, the risk of total disablement.    We consider that the location of the Post  Office station at Rugby more nearlyfulfils these conditions than do certain of the Company&apos;s Beam stations situated onthe coast, and this being so, on strategical grounds, we felt that our conclusions werenot affected.Dominion Aspect.    56.  Lord Passfield also kindly furnished us with a memorandum showing theposition in the different Dominions of Wireless Telephony communications.  Fromthis memorandum it is apparent that the Dominion Governments are  still undecidedas to their future  policy.  A Wireless Telephony service is already in  operationwith Canada from  Rugby, but through a station in  the United States of America,and we have noted  the desire  of His Majesty&apos;s Government  in  Canada for a directservice with the Mother country.  On the general question  we are of the opinion,however, that the Dominions will have no ground for comment or complaint in regardto the control of  Wireless Telephony  services operated from this country, providedthat transmission and reception are efficient.Foreign Competition.    57.  Our attention was drawn to foreign competition, principally American,with British efforts in  the field of wireless  communications generally (telegraphic,as well as telephonic).  The report  of the  Imperial Communications  Committeestates  that  the only  British commercial  company  capable of   meeting  suchcompetition is the I. &amp; I. C, and we  feel, therefore,  that every assistance should begiven to this company, by diplomatic  and other means, to obtain concessions inforeign countries and throughout the Empire.     Complaint  has been made that  the  Post  Office  purchases  the bulk of  its requirements of wireless material from a firm  with  works in London, but financed by American capital, in preference to purchasing from  Cables and  Wireless,  Ltd.,the parent company of the I. &amp; I. C.   The Post Office  state that  tenders are
invited  from both  companies,  but that those of the  former have  usually been successful because they are not only slightly cheaper, but are, from a technical pointof view, superior, and that it would not be in accordance with the usual practice ofGovernment Departments to discriminate between two firms, both employing british labour, by reason of the existence of foreign capital.  Any such discrimination would open large and debatable questions of policy.    We  are informed by  the Post  Office that they have  now  made  special arrangements with Cables  and Wireless, Limited, by  which it is hoped that  thedifficulties mentioned above, in enabling this Company to  secure  orders,  will be overcome.    58.  After carefully  weighing the  conclusions set  out above,  we make  thefollowing recommendations :     (1) That the long-distance Wireless Telephony services in the United Kingdom          should be retained under Government control  and operated by  the Post          Office through the Rugby station for transmission, and through that at          Baldock or elsewhere for reception.    (2) That the Post  Office  should  open up  new  services with the Dominions,          Colonies and foreign countries whenever economically justified.    (3) That Imperial  and  International  Communications,  Limited, should be          helped, by diplomatic and other means, in their endeavours to obtain          concessions  in  the Dominions,  Colonies and  foreign  countries.   The          recommendation applies to Wireless Telegraphy, as well as to  Wireless          Telephony services.IX. RECOMMENDATIONS.(Signed)THOMSON  (Chairman).H. B. LEES-SMITH.F. W.

-      197   ..134&quot;APPENDIX  B.Stenographic Notes of  the  Evidence  of  Repre-sentatives   of  the  Imperial  and  InternationalCommunications,   Limited,   given   before   theCabinet  Committee on  Wireless Telephony attheir   Second   and  Third  Meetings   held   on November 25, 1929, and December  5, 1929.                             I.        Second Meeting of the Committee held on                   November 25, 1929.    SIR BASIL  BLACKETT  AND MARCHESE MARCONI,                    Called and Examined.    Lord Thomson: &quot;Well, we are met together in pursuance of the last decision of this Committee, which was to invite you, Sir Basil, and anyone else whom you might like to bring, to attend this meet- ing for  the purpose of giving evidence in regard to the claims of Imperial and International Communications, Ltd., to. take over the control of the wireless telephone services. Would you like to make a statement now, Sir Basil?   Sir Basil Blackett: I should like, at the outset to say, on behalf of the Company and myself, how  grateful we are to  His Majesty&apos;s Government for appointing this Committee.  We court the fullest enquiry  in the widest possible standpoint into our ease, and we are extremely grateful to the Government for  giving us this opportunity.   I do  not know what documents have  been supplied to the Com- mittee.  I have therefore brought with me and desire to hand in the following/&apos;   Lord Thomson:  That is a very long  document which you have handed in,  Sir  Basil, and it will need a certain&apos; amount of study. However, there are one or two points on which I think the Committee would like a little elucidation. In my view, the first is this question of  policy and your own attitude to  the policy as laid down by  the Government  at  this Conference which took place last year.  As I understand  the  general tenor of your remarks,  you claim for  the Company a specially privileged position  on the  ground, first,  thatyou are a Government nominee as Chairman, and in the second placeon certain understandingscertain conclusions that you deduced asregards the  special position of the Company.   I think you read  outsomething  about that when yOu took over the  Chairmanship youunderstood I refer, for example, to that first  sentence you readout   &apos;      &apos;&apos; The Post Office in London will reserve the right to conduct   the external  telephonic services of Great Britain; but will agree   with  the Company the terms on which it wil\ have the right to   use the  Company&apos;s  wireless  stations, or portions thereof,  for   telephonic purposes.&quot;   Sir Basil Blackett: Yes.       -[20612]* See Appendix.
    Lord  Thomson:  You  gathered  from  that  decision that your Company was in a specially privileged position, and that the ques- tion of it conducting telephonic services  was wholly reserved; so to speak, still in doubt.    Sir Basil Blackett:  The question of its being used  as an agency for providing the  wireless  link is - all that is in question.   It is  not the question of us becoming the conductors of the telephonic services. 1  certainly  understood  that sentence to mean that, while the Com- pany would not itself conduct, on its own, telephonic services over- seas, it could expect the Post Office to use its agency on reasonable terms, and its stations,  and I submit that is the only possible mean- ing of this sentence if it has&apos;any meaning at all.    Lord  Thomson: I  should  have  said it .was  a  perfectly clear-statement          but will agree with the Company the terms on which it will       have the right.&quot;    Sir Basil Blackett:  I would point out that the Post Office have made no attempt to agree with the Company the terms upon which it should do it.    Lord Thomson: I should like the  Postmaster-General to  make any remarks on that he cares to.    Mr. Lees Smith: I did not intend myself to take very much part in this discussion with Sir Basil Blackett, but if I am invited I would like to draw his attention to this. Is he aware of the actual words ofthe Cabinet Decision on the matter ? I can read it:        &apos;&apos; That the  right to  determine the future  conduct of wireless    telephonic services should be reserved to the  Government and    that  accordingly  the  merger should   be  informed  that  His    Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is not prepared to sell or   lease any form of communication  by means of telephony, and    will require as a condition of the lease of the  beam telegraphic   services that provision shall be made for the use of  wireless tele-   graph stations or portions thereof by His Majesty&apos;s  Government,   if desired, for telephonic purposes upon royalty terms.&quot;    Sir Basil Blackett:  I was not aware  of  the exact terms of that Cabinet Decision which, so far as&apos;I am aware, was never communi- cated to me or my Company in that form, but I was perfectly aware of the position that, while the Post Office Beam  Stations were to beleased to the  Company for  the  purpose  of wireless telegraphicbusiness, the question of how the overseas telephonic business was tobe conducted was reserved, subject to retention by  the Post Office oftheir monopoly of telephonic business.   That does not seem to  meto touch the point- I do not see what the meaning of this sentence in this report could possibly be if it meant that the Post Office werefree to use us or not to use us at its own sweet will.  That is certainly not the natural meaning of that sentence.    Mr. Lees Smith: May I put it in this  way.   Do you  contend,Sir Basil, that  this sentence here ties  the Government  down  tothe position that,  even if  it comes to the conclusion that inter-national wireless telephony can be conducted more effectively byconcentration at Rugby than by using the beam stations, it is stillbound to use the beam stations in advance ?   Sir Basil Blackett: I claim,  this, that the Government is undera moral obligation to use its best endeavours to arrange to associatethe Communications  Company with it in  the business of wirelesstelephony, and my complaint, if I might say so to the Postmaster--General, is  that so far  from making any effort to use  us,  the PostOffice have, to  all appearances, done their  best to avoid  giving  usa chance  of showing that we have anything to  offer.   Mr. Lees Smith: That is another point.  I  am on  the  pointof the position of the Post Office by  this sentence in the Reportof the Wireless  Conference.   The point I wish to  make is this : isit  claimed that the Post Office, by this statement, is  compelled  touse the beam stations even though it considers that,  on technical grounds,  concentration  at  Rugby would  be superior?/
     Sir Basil Blackett.- I would point out that that is a hypothetical  question.     Mr. Lees Smith: No, why is it hypothetical?  I thought your  argument was  that the Post Office  ....     Sir Basil Blackett:  I  have made it perfectly clear,  I think,  what my claim is.  I have put it several  times  in my document,  &quot; provided  reasonable financial and  other arrangements  can be  reached,&quot;  &quot; provided we are able  to  offer a commercial  service,  and that  we can  come to reasonable  commercial terms with the  Post Office.&quot;     Lord Thomson:  We  want to give you  every  chance of stating  your  case.  The first point  that arises  is  this.   Tou claim that  there is some moral obligation on the part of the Government to  give your Company the agency.     Sir Basil Blackett: Not necessarily to give it to us, but to try  and give it to us.     Lord  Thomson: Well, to try and  give  it to  you.    Supposing  that, in the best interests of the  country, some course has got to be  taken  by  the  Government,  is  your  whole case  based  on some  understanding that you have got, or some  interpretation that you  have put upon  this other phrase         &apos;&apos; The Post Office in London will reserve the right .  . .  .&quot; ?     Sir Basil Blackett: No, my main case is based on  many other grounds that I have  already given you.   So  far  as this  point is concerned,  my  own position is that  it came  as a shock to  me that the  Post Office read this as meaning nothing, because I think that is a short statement of their attitude in the matter,  and  that it was quite contrary to the  natural  meaning of  the  words  in  the Report, which was  all that I or the public had to go on.    Lord  Thomson:   Well,   that is the  question now  for  the Committee to consider when we are alone.  Has any other member of  the  Committee  got any  question  to  put  on  that point?  I conclude that is your general position; that,this statement, which is the only thing the Company or the public had to go on, does, in your opinion,  impose on the Government  a moral  obligation  to try  to come to terms with your Company.    Sir  Basil Blackett: Yes, so far as that  point  is concerned.   Lord  Thomson:  That is your  argument  on  that particular point ?   Sir  Basil Blackett:  Yes, reinforced, if I  may add this, by the paragraph  I read from the  Report  that the  whole success of this amalgamation of the  cable  and  wireless  business  of  the  Empire in one public utility company does depend on getting co-operation by the  Governments as recommended by the Conference.   Lord Thomson :  But that is a later point.   Sir Basil Blackett: That is the second part of this point.   Lord Thomson :  I think all these arguments you have developed are in this long statement which we will study later on.  You made as your second point, or I  think  it  was your  third  point, the question of research?   Sir Basil Blackett: Yes.   Lord Thomson:  And you asked for an  assurance from the Post Office that there would be  no research work  conducted through American  agencies.   Sir Basil Blackett: No, I do not think that was quite the formin which I put  it,  or  if it was it certainly does not express mymeaning.   What I think I said was  that  I presumed the PostOffice has ho understanding or agreement with American organisa-tions in the United States or in this country which prevented theexchange of  technical information  or  manufacturing  experience with  either Government Departments or with the Communicaticr.:     [20612]                                           JJ 2
Company and its associates, and I should like  an assurance onthat point.    Lord Thomson:  In other words, that we are  not in any senseexcluding you from the pool of knowledge?    Sir Basil Blackett: That they have not bound themselves to an american company in a way which would prevent them using us.    Lord  Thomson:   That is merely  a  request on  the part  ofSir Basil.  It is not  a question for discussion here.  The last pointI have noted for discussion, while we  have  the advantage Of yourpresence, is in connection with  really largely a  technical matter,i:e., whether your arrangements would be more efficient than otherways.  I do not  want to go  deeply into that, and  I do not knowwhether  any member of the Committee has any questions, but wehave the advantage of the presence of Marchese Marconi here, andif he has anything to say on the technical side we  should be pleased to hear  him.    Marchese Marconi:  I only  arrived this  morning.   I only sawthat a few  hours ago,  and perhaps the Committee will be goodenough to allow me  to put in a statement in a few days.   I havebeen conducting researches in wireless telephony for many months,and I am aware  of the results  of the Post Office communications,,because  I pick them up, or nearly all  of them, on  my  yacht, andI know the conversations that are going on and the difficulties theyhave occasionally;  the number  of hours they  can  work, and  thenumber  of hours they cannot work.   Of course I will not refer tothat in any statement I make unless I am asked questions  by  theCommittee,  but I will limit myself to the views on the technicalside of wireless  telephony generally.    Lord Thomson:  You would like a couple of days or three days in which to prepare  a statement?    Marchese Marconi:  Yes, it would be a very short statement.    Lord  Thomson:  And  you  would  be glad  to come here andamplify  that?    Marchese- Marconi:  If the Committee so desires.    Lord Thomson: I think that would be very valuable to us, and&apos; we shall be  very  grateful for  your paper.  Has any  member of  theCommittee any questions to raise on the general point of view asrepresented by Sir Basil Blackett?    Marchese Marconi:  If the   Committee  could  give  me some indication of what questions they would like me to answer, or what information they would like me  to give, it would help  me verymuch in the preparation of this  statement, and perhaps save time.    Mr. Lees Smith: There were certain claims based on technical consideration.   That  would  be very valuable.   That is  what wewould like the  Marchese Marconi&apos;s opinion  on.    Sir Basil -Blackett: As I  have the  advantage  of having  theother party  to the dispute among the judges ....    Lord Thomson:  Let me deal with  that point  at  once.  ThePostmaster-General is not one of your judges, none of us are;  butthe  last  person  to be your judge is the Postmaster-General.   Weare  advising the Government in  this matter, but we are a perfectlyimpartial Committee met here as fully as possible to find out yourpoints of view in the fullest sense of the term and to do you justice. In no sense is  the Postmaster-General here as an advocate  of  one side or the other. We want to hear your case as fully as possible.You have made  certain statements in. that paper about  technical questions and  we will be grateful, as  a Committee  seeking  forinformation, to know how far  they can be justified; and if  soeminent a scientist  as  the Marchese Marconi is able  to  assist  uswe shall be grateful.    Sir  Basil Blackett:  May  I  assure you, Sir, that  I  have no intention of suggesting  for a  moment that  this Committee  is anything but an impartial Committee,  or that anybody here was\
  present  for any other purpose,  but getting the full facts.  What  I say about the situation is that we are in this difficulty;  we do  not know what the  Post Office objection  to working  with us is. What is their claim  as to the service they can render?  In what  direction do they  suggest our  service&apos; would  be inferior?   The  Postmaster-General has just suggested that concentration at Rugby  is one of the points.   If we were informed what the claims were  we should be in a much better position  in presenting  our  case.  We have not had the Post Office side at all.     Lord Thomson: Well, in a sense I do not think you can expect  the Post Office side.  You are not here engaged in a process against  the Post  Office at least  I hope not, although I am bound to say  that parts of your document would give that impression.   We want  to  find out what is the substance of your claim  to conduct, as agent or in some other form,  the wireless telephonic services of the - British Empire.   That is what it comes to.   The big point that you first raised about policy and what you understood,  I think we have  cleared up.  After that, anything that you can put forward before us which  will show that, for the benefit of the whole country your service  is  a good one, will be received with respect and get the attention that  it  deserves.   You are not here fighting a case against the Post Office.  You are trying to justify a  claim to take over certain services  for or on behalf of the Post Office.         ,    Sir Basil Blackett:  Thank you.   I do not wish to quarrel with words, but there is  no question of our taking over.  We are asking to be  employed, not  to entrench in any way on  the preserves of anybody  else,  but to  be used with a view to that collaboration of which I have spoken, to the benefit  of the unification of the radio- electric communications of this country.  So far as the Empire is concerned, the  Post  Office  have  no  possibility of  developing services except from this country to some  other country.   We are anxious,  and it  is part of one of the purposes for which we  are established, to develop inter-Imperial communications  from each part of the Empire to every other,  so that we  are  seriously  con- cerned in, telephonic  services between,  shall we say,  India and South Africa,  Australia and  New Zealand, Australia and Canada or any other that you may mention.    Lord  Thomson:  At this  moment you  are charged only with the telegraphic  services?    Sir Basil Blackett:  In this country, but not in the  Empire.    Marchese  Marconi:  We have installed  telephone communica- tions between other countries.    Lord Thomson:  Well, what I want to feel quite satisfied about is this : that in that document which you have read out to us and which we have before us you have stated all that you have to say, or would  you like  to  substantiate  any further  points before  the Committee ?    Sir Basil Blackett:  I  should be  very  glad  to come again,  if necessary, to answer  any questions  the  Committee would like to ask. It. is a general statement of our position.  It is not an attempt to do more than to make a  general statement that we believe we can provide as good, if not better, wireless links for telephonic purposes, from this  country to elsewhere, than  the Post Office.   We have not gone into  the details  of that, nor into  an examination of such points, as suggested by the  Postmaster-General, that there is  something in concentration at  Rugby which would  make the service better.  We should like very much, if I may repeat my question, to know why it is so, because if we are to  present our case  I think we ought to be in a position to know what the claim is.    Lord  Thomson:  Apparently you do. not  know the position with regard  to  the Post Office, but you are rather inclined to  condemn their policy.    Sir Basd Blackett: We know - their  position as  regards  theservices that the  Post Office are  doing. We  do not know what thearguments are  on which they rest the case that concentration atRugby  has advantages over non-concentration.
   Lord  Thomson: That  ignorance  does  not  prevent  you putting up your case as fully as possible, recommending in other words that your system is a very good one, we will say not the best ....   Sir Basil Blackett: Lhelieve it is  better than any other available at present.   Lord  Thomson:  That could be devised  ?   Sir Basil Blackett: That could at present be devised.   Lord  Thomson:  That is a perfectly reasonable attitude.   Mr. Gillett:  I should first  like  to point out to Sir Basil that, sofar as I am concerned, the information he has given  is not the infor-mation, personally, that I wanted.  I want  to hear from his Companywhat the financial results of his proposals are going to be.    Thatseems  to be a matter of some moment, rather than any decisions taken by the late Government, decisions which I do not feel bound by.  I  should have liked to have heard from your Company what youestimate your capital expenditure will be if what you are suggestingis carried out.  I should like to know what the result would be to thepublic  in regard to  increased  charges. Could we have some of the statements you  have made  more fully substantiated?  One or two were just statements and  no  arguments were given in support.   Ishould like to know whether  your plan wordd mean the abandonment of the Rugby service or whether  it would work  in with it; and if adopted, what the financial result is likely to be,  so  that  we cancompare it with figures provided by  the Post Office.   Sir Basil Blackett: I should only be too happy if we could havean opportunity  of discussing  these questions with  the Post Office.Our  difficulty is that the  Post Office has  been unwilling to discuss them.  As regards one or  two questions, I think I can  answer them at once.   Our claim is that  the capital expenditure  that would haveto be incurred, if we are used as the  agency, would be very consider^ably less than the capital expenditure that  would have to be incurred by the Post Office if they  do not use our  agency; that the taxpayerwill  have to incur capital expenditure in order to get  exactly the sameservice as he would get without incurring  that capital expenditure  ifhe uses us, i.e., there is a net saving to the  nation of a considerableamount  of capital expenditure if we are  used compared with whatthere would be if we were  not  used.  As far as the cost of the service is concerned, presumably, as  there would be a saving in the capital cost, the facilities that will be given will  be greater or the chargesless than if the Post Office proceed to establish stations of their  own.The absence of substantiation  of some of my statements to which youreferred is, perhaps, due to the fact that I was unwilling to wearythe  Committee  with an even longer document the Chairman hasalready  referred to  its length, but if there are any statements whichare  challenged I shall be most  happy to answer them.    Mr.  Gillett: You have just  made a statement,  but unless there are  some figures to back  it  I  do not think it is of any value to theCommittee.  It is your opinion but nothing more.  Can we have anyfigures ?     Sir Basil Blackett: If it is desired by  the Committee to  examine fully  whether  by using our services you  can get as good,or better service than by not using us, then I have secured all I came for, viz.,. that our case will be examined on merits with a view to our being used if we  can offer as  good or  better telephonic services than the Post Office can offer without our help and at less cost.     Mr.  Pethick Lawrence:  You have used on several occasions the expression  &quot; use  our agency.&quot;  I should rather like  to  know exactly  what you mean by that phrase.     Sir  Basil- Blackett: That again is a question  of detail which we  shall be happy to  enter into.     Mr.  Pethick Lawrence :  I should have thought  it was more than detail, and I should like to  know exactly what you mean.     Sir  Basil  Blackett:  Our  stations are  there.   It is simply  a question of connecting up our stations, on a call being put through,
with the telephonic system of this country.  Actually, at the trans-mitter,  there would be possibly one man concerned.  If the  PostOffice wish to  have their officer actually doing the transmissionthat would be a matter for arrangement.   It is merely a questionof switching the  telephone  system  on to  the wireless links.  Thepoint is, really, the use of our stations.  Whether under our controller under the Post Office, for that purpose, is a matter on which wehave no special views.  It is simply a matter for making the bestarrangements for  suiting  all parties.   Lord  Thomson:   I  think   what  would be valuable to  theCommittee, Sir Basil, is, without making any comparative estimateof the different costs, if you would submit to  us in writing what you  think the cost of your  proposal would be.   Marchese Marconi: I could perhaps, in my statement, give some indication or enlighten the Committee as to what  my views arewith regard to  the approximate  cost.   Lord Thomson:  If you could give a detailed statement of the costs under various heads; reduction of  charge to  the consumeror reduced  cost to the taxpayer.   Those are the two points youraise.   The Committee would like,  I am  sure,  to know what  yourproposal would cost.   We could have  that in money and, withoutany  reference to  the Post  Office or anything else, we should  then have a  definite figure before us, and we should then be able toget figures from the other end.   Sir Basil Blackett: We  should be most happy to do that.  Oursimple point is that we have never been asked  for  this.  This isthe first time it has been suggested -they  would be welcome.   Lord Thomson:  That is not  a material point. , Now, the  chancehas come.   Sir Basil Blackett:  Cel&apos;tainly.   Lord Thomson: Let us know exactly what your proposals would cost.  Mr. Gillett  has  raised the point. The cost,to the taxpayersand  the cost of running later on.   Mr.  Gillett:  What the capital  expenditure  would be by theCompany and how it is likely to work out.   Sir  Basil Blackett: Obviously  the capital  expenditure  of theCompany would be less, because we have the  stations in existence and  somebody  else has to put  them up.   Lord Thomson.- We  should like  to  know the  cost of  yourscheme. Presumably you would want Government assistance on it.   Mr.  Lees Smith: We should know exactly what  would  be theTent, what would be the  charge.   Sir Basil Blackett: What we are really being asked to do  is tomake a firm offer, and we shall be very glad to do it.   Lord Thomson: That would clear the air.   It is really likeasking us to buy  a &quot;pig in a poke.&quot;   Sir  Basil Blackett: I  do not  want to  quarrel,  but we wrotea letter on the 6th August offering  these services.  We have hadno reply.   Mr.  Lees Smith:  May I say  that you wrote a letter on the6th  August offering these  services,, but it  was  a matter of  veryconsiderable  technical examination before a reply could be sent,and  obviously it is a matter which would take one to two months before  we could send a reply to that letter.                 i   Sir Basil Blackett: I do not quite  see why it should.   Lord Thomson:  I  do not think that is really material.  It has passed.   Sir Basil Blackett:  But we  have not  had the opportunity
    Mr. Lees Smith:  Before the opportunity was given the matter was taken out of the Postmaster-General&apos;s hands and  referred toanother  department.    Sir Basil  Blackett:  That  was two  months after,  but in themeantime we have had evidence that the Post  Office, so far fromdesiring our services, are trying not  to use them.    Lord Thomson : We have started a new chapter, and, as a resultof your first letter to  the Post Office,  your second  and third letters to  the Chancellor  of the Exchequer,  this Committee has  beenappointed,  so we  start a  new  chapter  and we want to find outexactly what  your proposals cost and  if you  could substantiatesome of the  statements that have been made in that document which was  read out  to us.   I forget the particular  points  youraise, Mr. Gillett, but there was one which you put forward ....    Mr. Gillett: What the effect would  be on the Rugby station,whether that might have to be scrapped or not.    Sir Basil Blackett: No, I can answer that.   The Rugby station is at present in use for the purpose of the long waves  to the UnitedStates, and so  long  as that  goes on the  Rugby  station will berequired.  If we were asked to do so naturally the Company wouldbe  perfectly willing to  make suggestions  for taking over Rugby,but I do not think that is what we are  asked to do.    Lord Thomson:  I think,  on the question of Rugby, if theMarchese would give his views  on the subject of long  waves itwould be rather interesting.    Marchese Marconi: I do not know what Rugby is  used for nowapart from telegraphy.  I think it has a news broadcasting service.    Mr. Lees Smith:  The Empire Broadcast.    Marchese Marconi:  I  think that is a very valuable thing, butI do not think long waves can be used for distances such as thosewhich separate England from South Africa or India or Australia.    Lord Thomson: That  will be very valuable information for usto have as a Committee if yOu can  give us your opinion on that.    Marchese  Marconi:   There  is  also  the   question  whetherpractically all the range of long waves is not already  filled up, but even  apart  from  that  I  do  not think  the long waves  willcommunicate to South Africa telephony or to any other far distantcountry, further than the United States, because of the atmosphericconditions to which long waves seem  to be particularly subject.    Lord Thomson:  I think it would also be  of interest  to  theCommittee to  have an opinion,  from  a^man like yourself,  on thesubject of television and its development.    Marchese Marconi: I should be very glad to let  you have it.I will say something about that.  Of  course it will be to a certain extent speculative.  I  think the Post Office know a good deal abouttelevision now, or the absence of it.    Lord Thomson : Has any member  of the Committee any furtherquestions  to put?  Well, I  am very much  obliged to  you  twogentlemen for  coming.                         CONCLUSIONS.   It was agreed        To ask Sir Basil Blackett and  the Marchese Marconi to be   kind  enough  to prepare  papers,  for the information of  the   Committee, setting out definitely  the financial  implications of   their proposals  and elaborating their claims  to the  greater   technical efficiency of their system.
            Document handed in by Sir Basil Blackett.    1.  Letter to the Postmaster-General from myself as Chairmanof  Imperial and  International Communications,  Limited, datedthe 6th August, 1929, with three  enclosures, viz., a memorandumon  the subject  of Overseas Wireless  Telephony and two  chartssetting out the organisation  of the International  Telegraph  and telephone Corporation of  the  U.S.A.  and the Eadio corporation of America, showing  their world-wide ramification.    This letter offers the services of I.  &amp; I. C, Ltd., as agents in providing  the overseas link in  establishing, by means of its BeamStations,  direct telephonic communication  between  this countryand Canada,  Australia, the Union  of South Africa, India,  and egypt, and also with the Argentine, Brazil,  Siam and such othercountries  as might be  found desirable.   The second document is a letter from myself as  Chairman ofI. &amp; I. C, Ltd., dated the 27th September, 1929, addressed to theChancellor of the Exchequer, with enclosed  memorandum, appealingfor the intervention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in order that thequestion of the use of  the agency  of  I.  &amp; I.  C, Ltd., in providingoverseas wireless telephony, may be considered in  its  broadest aspectand not merely from the departmental standpoint  of the Post Office,in view of the national and imperial interests involved.   The third document is a  further  letter from  myself to theChancellor of the Exchequer,  dated the  1st October, 1929, withenclosure, relating to the action of the Post Office in removing a land-line  connection  on which the experimental working of  Beamtelephony to Canada was dependent.   2.  The point  at issue between I. &amp; I.  C-, Ltd., and the PostOffice can be shortly stated as follows :        The.Company desire that, for the purpose of providing the   overseas wireless link between this country and the Dominions,   and between this country and foreign countries other than the   U.S.A. with  which direct wireless telephony is  to be  estab-   lished,  the Post  Office should  use the wireless stations  of   I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., in this country on such  terms, both as to control   of the  telephonic channel and as  to finance, as may be mutually   agreed upon.   The  Post  Office desire to establish overseas wire-   less telephonic connections  by  means of  stations  of their own,   thereby entirely excluding I. &amp;  I.  C, Ltd., from the biisiness of   wireless telephony as far as the United Kingdom is concerned.   3.  It  is the contention of my Company    (a)  that the attitude taken up by the Post Office is contrary to the          letter and spirit of the recommendations of the Imperial          Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928;   (b)  that it is contrary to the  spirit, if not also to the letter, of the          understanding reached  between   representatives  of  the          Company  and  representatives   of  the Post  Office  in          February last, when  the  various agreements, leases and-          licences since  concluded between  the Post Office and          other  Government Departments   on the one hand and          I. &amp; I. C, Ltd.,  on the other were under discussion;   (c)  that the business of radio-electric communications cannot be          bisected into  radio-electric  telegraphy  and radio-electric          telephony and the two  conducted in  isolation,  the one          from the other,  without maiming  British radio-electric          research and retarding British radio-electric development;   (d)  that the use of the Beam Stations of the Company will pro-          vide  a  better  wireless telephony  service  than  can be          provided by  the Post Office  by  any short-wave  system          such as the American system now used by the Post Office;          or, alternatively, that a short-wave system as good as that          of the Company cannot be provided by the Post Office          unless they erect large aerials, thus duplicating the exist-          ing Beam Stations; and finally,     [20612]                                              J*
   (e) that  it  is  an  inevitable  consequence  of  the  Post  Office          attitude in the matter that the Department will be work-          ing in close co-operation with the American competitors of          I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., to the detriment of the strategic, political          and commercial interests of this country and of the  British          Empire, and in particular to the detriment of the interests          of I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., a Company which has been established          under Government  auspices as a&apos; great imperial public          utility&apos; company with special  reference  to meeting  the          menace  of American competition in communications.   4.  I desire to draw the;special attention of the Committee to thefact that I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., does not in any way ask to  encroach uponthe telephonic monopoly of the Post Office.  It simply asks that theexisting  Beam  Stations should be used  by  the Post Office  as thechannel for the radio-electric transmission of telephonic communica-tions  from this country overseas.   The- Company does not  ask forany  specially favourable financial  arrangements.   It  simply asksthat  its agency  should be availed of on  fair monetary terms  andon ordinary  business lines.   I would now proceed to develop these  contentions.   5.  Recommendation VIII and the first part of  Paragraph 44 ofthe Report of the  Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928read as follows :    Recommendation VIII.       &quot;Telephone  Services.    The  Post Office  in London  will   reserve the right to conduct the external telephonic services of   Great Britain;  but will  agree  with  the Company the  terms   on which it will have the right to  use the  Company&apos;s wireless   stations, or portions thereof, for telephonic  purposes.&quot;   Paragraph 44  reads :        &quot; The above scheme  is designed  to secure  a common basis   for  the  conduct  of  the  telegraphic communications  of  the   various parts of the  Empire.  The full  benefits  of the  scheme   can only  be secured  by  the  whole-hearted  co-operation  on the   part  of  all  the Governments  concerned,  and  of  the  under-   takings conducting telegraphic communications throughout the   Empire.  The establishment or authorisation of services within   the Empire which work  in opposition to, or  indeed  out of   harmony with,  the above  scheme would deprive it  of much of   its value, and would  militate against  the objects  which we have   endeavoured to attain.....&quot;   It  is  submitted  that Recommendation VIII  clearly  implies that, while there  is no obligation on the Post  Office in London topay  extravagant terms  to  I.  &amp; I. C,  Ltd.,  for  the use of itsstations,  those  stations  will  be used by the  Post Office  as thechannel  for  overseas wireless telephony,  provided reasonablefinancial  and other arrangements can be reached.  I submit  thatthis is the natural reading of  this recommendation, and  that  itcannot mean that the Post Office will  use these stations  if they feel  inclined, and  will not  use them  if  they  do  not  feel inclined to do  so. &apos;I feel sure that  the  general public  of the Empire haveunderstood this recommendation in the same sense as I understoodit myself when, coming entirely fresh to the subject in december last, I first read the Report of the Conference.    6.   During  the negotiations  which  took   place between  therepresentatives  of  the Post  Office  and other Government  Depart-ments and the  representatives of the Company, when the preciseprovisions of  the agreements,  leases  and licences: were  underdiscussion, a question arose as to the insertion, in some part of the documents, of  provisions setting out the terms on which the  PostOffice would use  the Company&apos;s Beam Stations.    The above recommendation of the  Conference had  been  incorporated  by thelawyers in one of the documents in almost  exactly the same wordsas those  used  in  the  recommendation.   It was then  pointed  out,on behalf of the Company, that in legal form  the  words used didnot  bind either party, and  it was suggested that the clause should
be modified.   It  was,  however, agreed by both  parties not to go further  with the  question at that stage, the representatives of theCompany being  fully  satisfied  by an undertaking given by theSecretary to the Post Office that no  orders  would be  placed forDominion telephony at Rugby for a period of  six months, and thatthe Post  Office  would co-operate with I. &amp;  I.  C,  Ltd.,  with aview to the development of the best overseas  telephonic apparatus,without prejudice to its ultimate use, and would give the company the same facilities  with regard  to  discussion as  the Post  Officegives to others.  For  myself, I came away  from that Conferencefully  satisfied that, provided the wireless telephonic system withwhich the Company were  then experimenting  proved its worth,there would  be no  question of the  Post  Office not employing theCompany as its  agents.  I clearly understood the promise of sixmonths&apos; grace as being made for the purpose of giving time forthe development of the Company&apos;s wireless telephonic experimentswith  a view to  our stations being used by  the Post Office, andI thought that I had secured a promise of Post  Office co-operationwith  the Company to this end, and  that it was  only a questionhenceforward whether     (a)  we were  able  to offer  a  commercial  service;  and    (b)  we could settle  reasonable financial  terms with  the Post          Office.    7.  I would  suggest to the Committee  that  the evidence of Sir  Otto Niemeyer should be invited both  as to his view of the meaning of  the recommendation  in  the Report  of  the Imperial Conference,  and  as  to  his  impression of  the negotiations  in February to which  I have just referred.    8.  It came  as a great shock to me and to  my Company to find, in the course of  the summer, that the Post Office was making no endeavour to  utilise  our telephonic service  to Canada,  but rather was procrastinating in regard to it, with the result that no steps could be  taken to open a commercial  service, and that the Post Office was  approaching the various  wireless companies  in the Empire, and the Governments of the Dominions and  of India, with a view, to quote its own  words used in a letter addressed by the Post Office to the  Indian Radio Telegraph  Company,  &quot; to using radio-telephony  terminals  in  this country which are independent of radio-telegraph  services,&quot; i.e., to avoid using the Beam Stations belonging to  my  Company.    It would  appear that, in  order to avoid using the stations of an -Imperial public utility company to establish direct communication between this country and Canada and  direct, communication to South America, the Post Office prefer to  co-operate  with  the  American  rivals  of  the   Company  in establishing indirect  services  via  New York  in the  one case, and via  Paris and Berlin in the other, and further that, so far from offering whole-hearted co-operation as a Department of the  British Government,  the  Post Office  are  engaged in  instigating other Governments of the  Empire, and  even the wireless companies in other parts of the  Empire which are associated with I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., to  use  their  best endeavours  to  avoid  co-operating with  my Company.  It is  impossible to believe  that  this is  the deliberate policy of the Post Office,  yet this is quite clearly the effect of their  attitude.  I  would point out that the  Company have received  no reply from the Postmaster-General, beyond the original acknowlegement- ment, to their  letter of  the  6th  August offering the  use  of their  stations, and are  quite in the dark as to the reasons which  actuate  the  Post Office  in not using these stations.   I find the position  all  the more difficult  to comprehend in that there is, so  far as I can  see,  no  conflict of  interest  between  the   Post   Office  and  I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., in regard to wireless^telephony.  The interests of  both parties are  identical, namely, that  wireless telephony  from-  this country  should  be developed to the  fullest extent  as  quickly  as possible,  and the best  possible service and the greatest possible  facilities provided, first within the Empire and then outside it, and  that British enterprise in the wireless telephonic field should be  encouraged in  all possible ways.  It seems to me  perfectly clear  that these purposes can be most certainly  achieved by collaboration  between the  Post Office  and my Company, and that absence of       [20612]                                            E 2
 collaboration must necessarily hamper progress and lead to inferior results.   All  I am asking for  is active and willing  collaboration. Once this principle is accepted, there will be no difficulty in arriving at satisfactory arrangements for working.    9.   I want at this point once again to lay  stress on the fact that I. &amp; I.  C, Ltd.,  is not  an ordinary company trading solely  for profit.  It is a public utility company covering the whole  Empire, with limitations ori its profits and with definite obligations to the. Governments of this country, and  of  the Empire,  in regard to strategic and political considerations, and  is  subject to a carefully devised  system of Governmental  supervision.  My  own  appoint- ment as Chairman required  and received  Governments approval, and I  was strongly influenced in accepting the position, less than a year ago, by the fact that, after a quarter of a century of  Govern- ment service,  I should  still  find myself engaged in public  duties in a Company so  constituted and organised as to make the motive of  public  service  uppermost,  and   ensure  close  and  continued co-operation with my old Department,  the British Treasury, and the  other Departments of Government.  I know that many  other people beside myself regard I. &amp; I. C,  Ltd., as an important new departure  in  the  organisation  of  public  utility services of  an Imperial  character,  as   a   new  and  promising  experiment  in combining private  enterprise with public service,  and it would be a severe disappointment  if, before the  Company is  a year old, it should find itself cold-shouldered by  the Department of the British Government which ought  to  be its natural and closest ally.    10.   My next  point  is that, by  using  the facilities offered  by I. &amp; I.  C, Ltd., the Post Office can  provide  a better radio-electric telephone service to the Dominions and India, and to countries out- side the British Empire, than by using any alternative short-wave system.  The Committee will no doubt desire to hear expert evidence on this  part of the subject  in due course. I will accordingly confine myself to-day to one,or two general considerations.    11.   The only overseas wireless telephone service  at present in commercial use direct from this country  to another country I omit the  European  telephone services is  the service  to the U.S.A. in which  the  Post Office are  working the  British end at Rugby and Baldock, and  the  American  Telegraph and Telephone Corporation are working the American end.  Eor this service a combination of long and short waves is in use.  It is  the existence of Rugby which makes possible the use of very high power for the  long wave, and if full allowance were made in  the costings for the very  heavy capital expenditure incurred in  the past at  Rugby,  this  system would  be shown to be very costly.  Eor technical reasons the long wave cannot be adopted for direct communication  with countries other than the U.S.A.   Even if this were not so, the enormous  expense of dupli- cating Rugby  in   Canada,  South Africa,  India, &amp;c.,  would  be prohibitive.  It is,  I am assured, accepted, by all the experts that a short-wave system must be adopted for any new overseas telephone services.  The success of the Beam wireless has been mainly due to the adoption of large aerials  at both  ends,  thus making the use of very high power unnecessary.  Similarly, the  best telephone results will be secured, with least cost, by using large directional aerials.  If the Post Office do not use  large and  properly designed aerials, any service they can give will be inferior to that  which  could be obtained by the use of the existing  Beam Stations.  If the Post Office  erect large aerials, they will simply be duplicating the Beam Stations at a cost  to the taxpayer which can be wholly eliminated  by the simple - process  of using the existing Beam Stations, and without obtaining results one  whit superior to  those which can  be obtained by  using the existing Beam Stations.   The duplicated Beam Stations would, of course, be capable of  being used for wireless telegraphy, a fieldfrom which the  Post Office have  just  withdrawn  in favour  ofI. &amp; I. C, Ltd., so that the telegraphic capacity thus made availablewould be wasted so far as concerns  the United Kingdom.  If thePost Office were not working with the stations of  I. &amp; I. C,  Ltd., *nd its associates in the Dominions and elsewhere, the result of thePost Office action would  be to cause the construction of new Beam Stations in those countries which are not  needed  and whose  tele-
graphic capacity would almost inevitably be used, either immediatelyor after a very short time, in competition with I. &amp; I. C, Ltd.  It istrue that the Post Office would, in fact, make some use of the  tele-graphic capacity for  sending service messages  in connection  withtheir telephony  working,  but from this  standpoint the Post office would be far better off  if they were using the existing Beam stations and had the whole of  the telegraphic services of I.,&amp; I.  C, Ltd., attheir disposal for such service messages.    12.   The potentialities of wireless discovery are so great  thatdogmatism at this stage would be absurd.   It is, however,  at  least possible that a  relay  system may in the end prove to give betterresults  for  long distance wireless  telephony in certain instancesthan a system of direct working.  For  purposes  of Imperial  tele-phony I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., have facilities for relay work, e.g., through their stations in India and  South Africa, which cannot possibly beat  the  disposal  of the  British Post Office  unless they  collaborate with I. &amp; I. C, Ltd.    13.   My next point relates to radio-electric research.  One ofthe biggest benefits offered by the establishment of I. &amp; I. C, Ltd.,is in the direction of  unification of radio-electric  research,  pureand applied, and its  correlation  with research in  connection  withthe manufacture  and  operation of  submarine  cables.   We arealready finding  considerable benefits from bringing together cablesand wireless  research inside the Company, but  this  is only the start.   The  question of research in connection with British businessof all kinds  is one to  which I attach very great importance.  If thiscountry and the Empire  are to hold their  place in the world it isextraordinarily  important   to  unify  and extend  radio-electricresearch.  At present there is a lamentable lack of co-ordination,not only as regards the British Empire, but even in this country.The  Radio  Research Board is  spending  some   18,000  a  year,mainly on  what  is  called  &quot;fundamental research.&quot;   The  PostOffice is apparently spending about  12,000 a  year, but this figurerefers to a time when the Beam  Stations were in the hands of thePost Office.   I  do not know what the  present figures would be.The Admiralty, the Air Force  and the War Office are  all spendingmoney on  radio-electric  research.  I.  &amp;  I.  C,  Ltd.,  and  itsassociates in this country are  spending some   100,000 a year  onradio-electric  research; this is  independent of their  exjtenditureon cable research, and the expenditure of the  Telegraph Construc-tion and Maintenance Company  on  research.  The  Post  Office andthe Defence Departments are  in touch,  to some extent, with the radio Research Board, but at present the research work of myCompany, which is and has been by far the largest factor in Britishradio-electric  research, is not co-ordinated with  the work of the radio  Research  Board.    I  have no exact  figures  regardingAmerican expenditure  on radio-electric research.   The AmericanTelegraph and  Telephone Corporation,  however,  spends 9  million dollars a year on research,  the major part of which, no  doubt, ison research other than radio-electric, but even so the expenditureof  this one American company on  radio-electric research is many times more than  the whole expenditure of this country on  similar work, and  the  American Telegraph and Telephone Corporation isonly one of many companies in  America engaged in radio-electricbusiness.    14.  The American Telegraph  and Telephone Corporation andthe British  Post Office  are working closely  together.   It would indeed be interesting to have a  comparison of the extent to whichthe Post Office  has co-operated in the development of its overseastelephony services, with      (a)  I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., and its associates on the one hand;     (b)  American companies in the U.S.A. or in this  country on          the other.     I presume that the Post Office has no  understanding or agree-ment with  American organisations in the  U.S.A.  or  this country which  prevent  the exchanging of technical information or manu-facturing experience  with other Government Departments, or withI.  &amp; I. C,  Ltd.,  and its  associates.  I should,  however, much like
an assurance on this point.  Co-operation in research work betweenthe Post Office and I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., would  not cut this countryoff from the benefit of American and foreign radio-electric research work, but it would ensure that this country  would get full value for all the British research work that is being done, and would notbe dangerously  dependent on foreign countries, as we are  boundto be if present conditions are perpetuated.  This country cannot afford  to   fall   behind  America  in  radio-electric  experience.I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., are bound to busy themselves  with  radio-electrictelephony and- research  connected therewith, if only because you cannot divorce research and  experience in radio-telegraphy fromresearch   and  experience   in  radio-telephony.    Radio-electriccommunication is essentially  a single and indivisible subject.  Ifthe Post Office exclude I. &amp; I.  C, Ltd., from  all participation  inradio-telephony  in this country, British radio-electric research willbe hamstrung. The potential value of the amount spent on researchby several authorities  acting in isolation must be far less  than thevalue of the same expenditure in collaboration.  Though at presentnot  concerned  with  radio-electric  telephony   in  this  country,I. &amp; I.  C,  Ltd., are  necessarily concerned  with  radio-electrictelephony in other countries,  both inside and outside the Empire,and  must necessarily  continue  research work in connection  withradio-electric  telephony, both because it cannot be  divorced fromradio-electric  telegraphy,  and because  of the  interests of theCompany in telephony outside the United Kingdom.   15.  I.   &amp; I.  C,  Ltd.,  are  confronted  with  widespreadcompetition  from the U.S.A. in particular, and from  other foreigncountries, both  in the  business  of  communications and on the manufacturing side.   The coming, together of cables and wirelesswas  an  effort to rationalise  throughout the  Empire the businessof British radio-electric  communications,  and to enable it to meetforeign competition.  The Post Office attitude  is a direct encourage-ment and assistance to the U.S.A. competitors  of I. &amp; I. C,  Ltd.It would be interesting to know the value of  the orders placed  bythe Post Office in connection with its overseas  telephony services during the past two years with    (a) I. &amp;  I. C, Ltd., and its associates on the one hand;   (b) American  companies in  the U.S.A.,  or American-owned          companies in-this country, such as  Standard  Telephones          and Cables, Limited, on the other.   The fact that the Post Office are in close  touch with Americanradio-telephony  has naturally tended to make them use Americanproducts,  and not  to  use British  products.   Visitors from foreign government,  potential  purchasers of  wireless  apparatus,  findRugby and Baldock full  of American apparatus.   When they cometo our stations,  not  only can we not show  them British wirelesstelephone apparatus in commercial use, but  difficulties are placedin our way even for  the purpose of  experimental  demonstration.I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., have accepted serious liabilities as regards strategiccables, the  employment only of  British  personnel,  &amp;c,  and are.,I submit, entitled to active co-operation on the part of the Govern-ment, and  have strong reason  to complain   of  a  GovernmentDepartment  that, so  far from co-operating with them, acts  in away which encourages and strengthens their American competitors,either  as   regards   communications  services,  or  as  regardsmanufacture,   Colonel  Behn,  the  head of   the  InternationalTelegraph and Telephone Corporation of the United States, came to this country recently  to discuss with I.  &amp; I.  C, Ltd., a numberof questions  relating  to communications  in  various parts  of theworld in  which  his  organisation  and ours  are confronting  eachother in friendly competition or otherwise. In the  course of these discussions   Colonel   Behn  expressed his  willingness  to  avoidentering into competition with I. &amp; I.  C, Ltd., in the province of communications services inside the British  Empire, that is,  fromone  part of  the  British Empire to another. He went on, however,at once to say that this applied only to telegraphic  services,  since i. &amp; I. C,  Ltd., were not  interested  in telephony, whereas  he himself was  working on the  friendliest possible  terms  with theBritish Post Office, and he accordingly proposed to regard himself
as free to take as active a part as  possible in providing telephoniccommunications within the British Empire.  If I.  &amp; I. C,  Ltd.,are excluded from all participation in wireless telephony from thiscountry there is  no British organisation which can take  its  placein the  provision  of  wireless  telephonic  services  throughout  theEmpire.   The British  Post Office  cannot go outside the United&apos;Kingdom.   If it  uses its position  within the United Kingdom toprevent I. &amp; I. C, Ltd., from developing British wireless telephonybusiness at headquarters, the inevitable  result must be to  handover the future of wireless  telephonic communications and all  thecommercial and  manufacturing developments which  it implies to non-British enterprise.   16.  I appeal to the Committee, with  all the earnestness  I  cancommand,  to  examine  the  case  which  I  have presented to  themsympathetically and exhaustively.   I regard  the question at issue as one of vital importance.  I believe that my Company can rendervery great5  services  to  this country,  to the Empire, and to  theworld,  in the business of imperial and  international communica-tions, if it is in enjoyment of the confidence and reasonable supportof the Governments of the British Empire, and in particular of  theGovernment of this country.  If it  does  not secure the co-operationof the Government  of  this country  it is bound to fail, and in  avery short  time  the  leadership which  this country has always1enjoyed in  the business of providing the world with communica-tions  will  pass out of British hands.   Failure to recognise  thejust  claims of I. &amp;  I.  C, Ltd.,  to  play a definite  part in  thebusiness of  overseas wireless  telephony, will react  disastrously onthe capacity of the Company to provide overseas wireless telegraphicservices.  I recognise fully  the monopoly of the Post Office in  theprovision of&apos; internal telephonic  communications  in  this country,and the right of  the Post Office to reserve to itself the conduct ofthe external telephonic  services of Great Britain in accordance withthe recommendation of  the Imperial Gable and Wireless Conferenceof 1928.  I do claim,  however,  very strongly  that it is  the dutyof the Post  Office, having regard to the  vital national and imperial interests involved, to do its utmost to use I. &amp; I. C, Ltd.,  as itsagent for  the provision., of wireless  telephonic channels  for  thepurpose of  overseas telephony, and it is only in the event of  thePost Office being  unable to establish satisfactory overseas telephonicservices  on a commercial  basis  by  means  of   the  agency  ofI. &amp; I.  C,  Ltd., or in the event  of I.  &amp; I.  C, Ltd.,  refusing tosupply facilities on reasonable financial  terms, that the Post  office would be justified in setting the Company aside.
                             II.        Third Meeting of the Committee  held  on                     December 5, 1929.SIB BASIL BLACKETT, THE MARCHESE MARCONI, MAJOR        MUNRO, MB.  VYVYAN  AND ME. FRANKLIN,                    Called and  Examined.   Lord Thomson:  I propose that we start  this morning by askingSir Basil Blackett and Marchese  Marconi whether they have anygeneral statement to make  to  supplement  the written statementwe have received  on the various points  raised at our last meeting?   Sir Basil Blackett:  I have nothing  to add, Sir.   Marchese Marconi:  I have nothing to add, except that,  ofcourse,  I  am  ready to illustrate  any point if any explanation isrequired.   Lord Thomson:  I would like to draw your attention to  page 7of your memorandum, in the middle of  the  page, the paragraphwhich reads &quot;I mean,  in other words, that with the  use  of our new  aerials we are able to  guarantee  better Radio  TelephoneServices than  could be obtained by  the use of any other arrange-nients of which I am aware.&quot;   The point  about  that, Marchese,is  this.  Are you aware that small  aerials  have worked well with new York and Canada for a period of  eighteen months,  and thatthey have  been tested, very slightly  it is true, with  Australia,and were you  aware of that  when you  made that  statement?   Marchese Marconi: Yes; I was aware of that.  I also  believethat  if the aerials were larger the service would  be  much  better.I am aware of the  difficulties of  communication  with  New York.I  know exactly,  at least according to the Postmaster-General&apos;s figures,  the number of calls and the  number of successes they havehad in that  connection.   I am also  aware of the failures.   I havehad an  unfortunate experience.  On two  occasions I  have tried to speak to New York and I have not been able to get through.  that means, of course, that sometimes it does not work. I do not meanto say that with larger aerials it  would work every time, but  myopinion  is that it would work better.   Lord Thomson:   That opinion&apos; is based  on personal experienceof the working of the larger aerial?   Marchese Marconi: Yes, personal experience  and listening, into the American service as  worked  at  present.   Lord Thomson:  Can you elaborate  that  at  all  on technical grounds?  Can you give us  a reason for  it?   Marchese Marconi:  I think it is stated in my paper  here.  Dueto the concentration of energy brought  about by large  aerials I  am not  quoting  the exact words due  to the diminution  or reduction  of interference at  the receiving  end brought about  by large aerials and  also the reduction  of what we call distortion,  theservice appears to be better the larger the aerial.   Lord Thomson:  The reason being that a large  aerial  does what?   Marchese Marconi:  Gives stronger speech,  enables you to  do with less amplification  and reduces  outside  interference.   Lord Thomson:  Could Colonel Lee give us the results  of his experience  of   the  working  of the  telephone  service  with new york?   Colonel Lee:  We have  some charts which indicate  it.  the black lines indicate when it is  working and  the blanks indicatethat it is  not  working.  All these short-wave circuits suffer fromdisturbances due to fading caused sometimes by an electric  storm.The  Beam services  of the  Marconi Company are subject  to  thesame difficulty. They very rarely get a  complete twenty-four hours&apos;working on  any Beam service.  It  is  quite unusual.  Sometimes,r
practically the whole day is  completely washed out, so that the-Marchese Marconi&apos;s  remarks  apply with  equal force to  Beamservices.  I might add that the New York telephone service was conicpared last May with the Canadian New York Marconi service.  Atthat time, in May, we had not got  our largest power available.  the comparison  of what we did at that time and  what the marconi company did showed that we  were capable of working for a longertime  per day between  here  and New York  than  the Marconisystem  between  this country and Canada.  That was  a  slightlybetter service.    Marchese Marconi:  Was that  on a particular day?    Colonel  Lee:  During May, during  the whole  period  of thetrials.    Marchese Marconi: That is comparing one circuit with  anothercircuit.   They are never comparable.  Circuits may be working to-Canada  better or worse than they are working to New York.   Itwould be like comparing the Canadian circuit with the Indian circuit.I want to state emphatically, and it will be a satisfaction for me if itgoes on the record here, as things have gone on the-record in theCommittee that was  held in 1924,  that I consider it necessary and desirable  that  large  aerials,  properly constructed  and properlydesigned, should  be  used  for these stations.  I  stake my scientificreputation on that.  I am very glad of this opportunity of its going on the record, as I was  glad of other things going on the record inthe Committee of 1924.   Lord Thomson:,  That shall be recorded.  There  is  one otherquestion I personally want to put to you.  It is this.  You appear tohave got some new device in mind with regard to multiplex trans-mission, some modification of  the  multiplex.  Does that affect theproposals you have made hitherto ?   Marchese Marconi: Would you be kind enough, and  perhaps itwould hasten the proceedings if you  would do so, to indicate wherethat is.   Lord Thomson: I think it comes in  one of  your later papers-Proposal 2, which appears not to be identical with the original pro-posal.   I understand that you have some suggested modification ofthe multiplex system ?   Marchese Marconi: That means what is stated here &apos;&apos; the provi-sion of separate transmitters for telephony for each circuit, working on the existing Beam aerials.&quot;  It  will mean a separate transmitterfor  the  telephone service.  We would not use the telegraph trans-mitter for that purpose,  but  we  would  use a separate telephonetransmitter.   Of  course, the  scheme would cost something morethan it would cost if we were using  simple multiplex.   Lord Thomson : That would mean additional cost ?   Marchese Marconi: Yes.   Lord Thomson: To be borne by the Company ?   Marchese Marconi: To be  borne  by the Company, because theonly remuneration the Company are asking  for  is this rental plusroyalty.   Sir  Basil  Blackett:  The additional  charge in Proposal 2,  as opposed to Proposal  1, is  due  to the additional capital expenditure involved in putting in a separate transmitter.   a   Lord Thomson : That is the modification you propose to introduce into your original proposal with regard to this multiplex system ?   Marchese Marconi: Yes, with regard to Proposal No.  1.   Lord Thomson: The charge to  be borne by the Company ?   Marchese Marconi: The  capital expenditure would be borne bythe Company.   Lord Thomson: And the current expenditure is to be based  asit stands in that proposal ?    [20612]                                             i&apos;
   Marchese Marconi: Yes.   Lord Thomson:   11,000 per annum, plus a proportion of twentyper cent, of the gross receipts ?   Sir Basil Blackett: May I point out that.in Proposal No. 1 therental suggested is  11,000, plus twenty per cent., with a minimum of  25,000.  In proposal No.  2, which involves additional capitalexpenditure on  a separate transmitter, the larger rental is askedbecause of the larger capital expenditure and, of course, a  larger number of hours are guaranteed.   Lord Thomson:  And a larger rental is suggested ?   Sir Basil Blackett: Yes,  33,000 per annum.   Lord Thomson: With a minimum of  40,000 as compared witha minimum of  25,000 ?   Sir Basil Blackett: Yes.   Lord Thomson: A difference  of  15,000 a year.   Sir  Basil Blackett: Yes.   It is partly  a  question  of  runningexpenses and partly of capital.   Lord Thomson:  There is only one other question I want to put toyou and that is this, do these proposals that  you make apply to newservices, or what would be your terms for a new service, we will say,to Argentine ?   Sir Basil Blackett: We confined ourselves to these four Imperialservices in the first instance, but they are  applicable to any other services that might be desired where we have an existing Beamservice, such as Buenos Aires, Rio, and other places.   Lord Thomson:  They would, in other words, be applicable to all new services ?   Sir Basil Blackett: They can be applied, yes.   Mr. Pethick Lawrence : I do not think I understand.  &quot; They canbe applied; &quot; you mean similar terms?   Sir Basil Bldckett: We should be prepared to offer similar terms.   Mr. Pethick Lawrence : Which, when the  question arose, you would specify ?   Sir Basil Blackett : Yes.   Lord Thomson: But these  conditions would  apply absolutely tothe financial position ?    Sir  Basil Blackett: Yes.  I am not quite  sure that I have notover-stated  it even  so.   If  we had a larger number of circuits the-actual cost could probably be slightly reduced.   Marchese Marconi: It would be reduced.  It would cost us less.    Mr. Franklin:  Per circuit?    Marchese Marconi:  Yes,  per circuit.    Sir Basil Blackett: Provided that the  Beam exists already.    Lord Thomson:  In other words, with proposal No.  2 or  No. 37?the  combined  minimum of  40,000 would be  increased but in a smaller ratio in view of new  services?    Sir Basil Blackett: Yes.    Lord Thomson: You have here four  services and you  suggest  40,000 a  year minimum;  if you  had  five services it might not&quot;be  50,000 and if you had six services it might not be  60,000?    Sir Basil Blackett: That is so.  Undoubtedly  there would be a reduction on taking a quantity.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence : I should like to  ask what your proposals involve in the  matter of any breakdown?  Do your proposals cover the   provision   of  any  spare  transmitter and,  if  so,  do  you contemplate a  spare transmitter at each station, or are  you not proposing,  in these estimates, to make any such provision?
   Marchese Marconi:  Is that in respect of the first proposal, or all proposals?   Mr.  Pethick Lawrence: Any of them.  If you say it does not include  it,  but it would be an extra if you wish it done then, ofcourse,  there is differentiation between&apos; the three proposals, but if,in making  these proposals, you have already taken the matter intoaccount, that is  the point I want to understand?   Marchese Marconi:  At present I  do not think  at the  Beamstation  we  have got a spare set.   Of course, the  service  has notbeen interrupted I think for that reason. It has been running for two years  and there has never been any  interruption due to  a breakdown  of  that kind, because a transmitter is formed of severalvalves and several  elements and it is almost impossible to occurthat  the whole thing would break down.  One  valve  breaks downor one rectifier or something else and one replaces that.  However,.in proposal No. 3 there will be separate transmitters for each wave-length.   This  would give additional security because, in substance,that  is  a spare transmitter.   Mr.  Pethick  Lawrence:  So  that  your answer  is  that you donot take the provision of a spare transmitter into account and youdo not think it is necessary.  You do not think it is  necessary inthe earlier  proposals because a breakdown is not likely and you danot think  it is  necessary in the third  proposal because alreadythere is more than one  transmitter involved  and,  if necessary,temporarily that could carry the double  load?   Marchese Marconi: I do not  think it  is necessary  at all becauseour transmitters are not one machine so to speak; they are madeof elements of various  parts  which may break down or  may gowrong, but they are replaced or renewed  when they do break  down.It is almost inconceivable that the whole thing  would break  down.At every station,  of course, in these proposals as well, there  wouldbe spare parts of every important element of the transmitter.   Mr.  Pethick  Laivrence:  Though you do  not take  into account the provision  of  a  complete spare transmitter, you do take  intoaccount  the  provision  of   separate   repairable   parts  of  thetransmitter?&apos;   Marchese Marconi: Yes, replaceable  parts, or repairable  parts.   Lord Thomson: In that connection would you tell us  whetherit would be practicable  to work a service  to two destinations at different times of the day from the same  transmitter?   Marchese Marconi: It depends on the direction in which those two destinations are.  If they are approximately in accordance withthe direction of one of the beams, yes;  if they  were in a differentdirection which  was not the opposite  direction,  because  in the opposite direction  one could arrange to work that way, it  mightnot be possible.   Lord Thomson:  In case,  therefore,  of  the breakdown of one-transmitter you might have a place out  of action altogether  if you had not got a spare transmitter?   Marchese Marconi:  You are assuming  the  whole transmitterbreaks  down,  which I  suggest  is exceedingly  unlikely;  I should say almost impossible.   The time taken to repair the transmitteris a  very short time, a few minutes.  It is not a machine  like adynamo or like  an alternator which when it is broken down it is.broken  down.  Our power plant is in duplicate  and in triplicate insome cases.                           0   Mr.  Gillett:  On page 14, in estimating the income, you havetaken the figure of   6 for three  minutes?   Marchese Marconi:  Yes.   Mr.  Gillett:  May I ask what that is based  on?  Why did youtake that figure to  start with?   Marchese  Marconi:   Just  as a figure.   If  the Post Office, Ithink, is charging  9 for three minutes to the United States, we thought  6 per  three minutes might dc     [20612]                                            F  2
   Mr.  Gillett:  Rather a safer figure?   Marchese Marconi:  It might be  a  reasonable figure to  begin with.  The  Continental  practice is  about that  figure.   Mr.  Gillett:  It compares with the Continental figure?   Marchese Marconi:  Continental  rates to  South  Africa  areslightly, more than  6.   Mr.  Gillett:  Under your scheme  who would  fix  these figures?If any  changes  were required as the  years went on  who  wouldthen fix the figure, the Post Office?   Marchese Marconi:  The  Post Office, certainly.   Mr.  Gillett:  The Post Office would fix it?   Marchese Marconi:  Certainly.   Mr.  Gillett:  What are your views as to  the possibilities of expansion in the income?   Marchese Marconi:  I think we have estimated for  a  verymoderate number of calls.  I think the calls would be much morethan twenty, especially when dealing with  countries like those ofthe British Empire where the  same  language is spoken.  I  thinkprobably,  I  am not sure of it,  but I  venture to say that probably the Post Office would reduce this rate of   6 in  course  of time, asthe traffic increases.   Mr.  Gillett:  So  that  the total amount  received  might remainmuch the same, do you  mean, or do you think it would mean anincrease?   Marchese Marconi: I  should think it would increase, certainly,this  minimum of calls.   Of course, if we  were to double the callspresumably the same rate would be adhered to,  but  if we got verymuch more  than that improvement of the service, the Post  Officemight reduce the cost of  the call, in the  public interest.  I  thinkit would safeguard the  income or the profit coming  from  these stations, that it would not in any way reduce the profit but ratherincrease it.   Mr.  Gillett:  In your experience do  you expect that the incomewould increase rapidly or that it would be  a slow growing increase?   Marchese Marconi:  I think it would increase rapidly after acertain period, that  is,  after the public in both countries had gotaccustomed to using the service.   Mr.  Gillett:  Do  you mean  in two or  three years?   Marchese Marconi:  No.   Mr.  Gillett:  Longer than that?   Marchese Marconi: No, I should say a shorter time.  Of course,I am not an expert in this matter.   Mr.  Gillett:  I wondered whether you had  any experience inother countries that you could work on ?   Marchese Marconi:  We have got  some  experience  in  othercountries, but very recently;  the services have only just  been opened.   Lord Thomson: I notice on page  9,  in the last paragraph,  yousay  &apos;&apos; If independent stations are  erected  in England  and in theDominions,  the  cost  to  the  Dominions  will  certainly exceed 500,000.&quot;   On what do you base that figure ?   Marchese Marconi: On the cost of the  aerials and reflectors andon the cost  of the plant, having to  build absolutely new stations,plant and the rest, and  machinery everything that constitutes anew station.   Lord Thomson: Would it be absolutely necessary  to put up anyaerials ?   Marchese Marconi: Yes, they would  have to have other aerials.They could not use the same aerials, of course, and they would have
to have either power supplied by a public supply, or else erect powerplants.  They would have to have all the transmitting machinery,valves, dynamos, feeders, absorbers, all that kind  of gear, the very long list of stuff which goes to constitute a modern station.   Lord Thomson :What is the present position in those Dominions&apos;?Supposing your scheme came into working, would they have  any expenditure ?    Marchese Marconi:  They would have an expenditure similar towhat we should have in  England for adapting or putting through the telephone service on the existing telegraph service.   They wouldhave the same kind of expenditure and the same  amount of expendi-ture roughly as we should have in England.    Sir Basil Blackett:   Of  course, there would be  a considerablesaving in time because the Beam stations are there ready to be usedin the  Dominions.    Lord Thomson: Is your opinion that they are  not utilisable for communication with the Bugby station, for example ?    Marchese Marconi: I think they are utilisable provided Bugby isefficiently installed, yes.    Lord Thomson:  Then this question  of the  500,000 would notarise in the same acute form ?    Marchese Marconi:  If you  use  our  associated stations in theDominions,  no.    Lord Thomson: In other words, this figure of  500,000 is basedon the fact that those stations are not utilisable ?    Sir Basil Blackett: It is based on the assumption, if I may put itin this way,  that if  the  Post Office do not use us at  this end theywould  not be proposing to use us at the other end.    Lord Thomson:  It  is  a question for the Dominions,  surely,isn&apos;t it ?    Marchese Marconi: It is on the assumption that they would notbe utilised.  It is an assumption.    Lord Thomson: That is the only basis you have got for makingthat statement ?    Marchese Marconi: It is on that basis.    Lord  Thomson:  That  the  stations  in the  Dominions already existing, the Beam stations, would not function with the Post Officearrangements even if those arrangements were satisfactory ?    Marchese Marconi: It is on the assumption that the stations, andI am talking about the stations with which we work Beam telegraphynow, would not be used.  It is on that assumption.    Lord Thomson:  And you base that  assumption partly  on thefact that the present installation at Bugby is not  suitable for com-communicating with them ?    Marchese Marconi: I am assuming that it might not be,  or thatarrangements could not  be made.  I am simply saying that, to coni-rnunicate  efficiently with these stations in the Dominions, in order not to  sacrifice any  of their efficiency, a station or stations of equalefficiency  would have to be installed in England.    Mr. Pethick  Lawrence : Further to that  point, I do not think you gave  us a figure of what it would  cost in the  Dominions toestablish connection  under proposal No. 2, for instance.  You said it  would involve  the same  expense  in the  Dominion as it  wouldinvolve here.  Can you  give us  any idea as to what it would be ?    Marchese Marconi:   Substantially the same.  There are some differences of cost  sometimes  in freights  and  labour  in  othercountries  as compared   with this country,   but substantially  thesame.    Mr. Pethick  Lawrence : My point is I do not think you havegiven  an  estimate of the cost of the service here and therefore
you are  referring  us  to something of which  we have not got thecost.   What do you  anticipate would  be the additional cost?  Iam not pinning you down to it, but I want  to get a rough idea?    Marchese Marconi: The capital  cost  to  the  Company,  youmean ?    Mr: Pethick Lawrence:  It  would be borne by the  Company?    Marchese  Marconi:  Assuming  the  Company  does  it,  theadditional cost  that would be incurred by  utilising these stations    Mr. Pethick Lawrence :  In  the Dominions?    Sir Basil Blackett: This expenditure  would be  incurred to the wireless Companies in the  Dominions and would  be roughly thesame figure, with  some differences in freight  and Customs, as theexpenditure of  the Imperial and  International Communications,Limited, here.   I have not got exact  figures, but we have someestimates, I think, of the capital cost  under  each  scheme we&apos; are proposing.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence:  I  was thinking for the moment of proposal  No. 2.    Sir Basil Blackett: On proposal No. 2 the capital  cost would be approximately,  I think,  125,000 for four stations.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence: You are saying that, if the Post  Officerun a  service it will  not only be a disadvantage to  this country,but it  will involve the Dominions in a cost  of   500,000?  Thatis one  of the arguments you, quite properly,  are putting forward?    Marchese Marconi: Yes.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence : What I am trying to elicit, and I think you have answered it now, is, that under your scheme a cost  willbe incurred  in  the Dominions which  will be in the neighbourhoodof  125,000.   It  would be a little  more because of the greatercharge  for materials.    Sir  Basil Blackett: That cost would be  incurred,  of course, bythe Wireless Companies in the Dominions.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence :  I am coming to that, but the cost wouldbe  incurred.    When  you  say  it   would  be   incurred   bythe  Wireless   Companies   that   in  its  turn   will  depend upon the arrangement which the Dominion makes with you,  but1 assume that to be the case and that you make some arrangement with the Dominion Company similar to the arrangement you aresuggesting we make with  you here.  You are not  a  philanthropiccompany and, therefore,  the Dominion will have to pay for thatin the  terms it  makes with you for running that particular service,so that, as against  the  500,000 which you say the Dominion wouldbe  charged, you are  contemplating  an expenditure  which wouldprobably amount to at least   150,000.  Of course the  Dominionwould  pay  in meal or malt for the  charge that is a comparablefigure in the Dominion.    Sir  Basil Blackett: One assumes that it  would enter into  anarrangement, perhaps similar to our rental and royalty arrange-ment,  with  the Company  at  that  end.   That  is  the  sort ofassumption  we  make.    Lord  Thomson: In other words,  supposing  they had to  pay 500,000 for this  installation,  they  have  got to face an annualcharge  to have  their  requirements satisfied by your  interest?    Sir  Basil Blackett: Yes.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence:  Based on  a figure in the neighbourhoodof  150,000?    Marchese Marconi: I think  that is rather a high estimate.    Mr. Pethick Lawrence : You said it would be over  125,000.I put it at  150,000,  but it is only a vague figure, I quite agree.    Marchese Marconi: Yes.
    Lord Thomson:  The  Company would  meet the capital charge and take the interest on it  out of the Dominion ?    Sir  Basil Blackett: Of  course, the Dominion Company would run the service.  It is just a question of who runs the service.    Lord Thomson:   Are  the Dominion  stations at present, the&apos;existing ones, situated at convenient places for telephony purposes?For example,  is the  Beam station near Capetown suitably situatedto serve the South African  interests ?    Sir  Basil  Blackett: I  think Mr. Vyvyan  can answer  that question.    Mr. Vyvyan; It is a question whether most telephone conversa-tions will  be  with Pretoria,  Johannesburg,  or  Capetown.    you cannot  serve  with one station all three places, unless you  haverelay stations  from them.    Lord Thomson: You have  no  experience to show you yet whichis the place ?    Mr&apos;. Vyvyan : I do not know  which place is likely to get mosttelephone   conversations.  I should assume Johannesburg would.Then if there  is a suitable land line Johannesburg or Capetowncould be linked up with district stations,  or a wireless link could beput up.    Marchese Marconi:  I do not know much about this side of thematter.  I also do not know whether there  is a great differencebetween the telegraphic interests of the public, let us say, and thetelephonic  interests;  whether there  are  centres  which are  moretelephonic  than telegraphic.  I  do not  know.   It may be.    Nodoubt the  Post  Office,  with their experience,  could enlighten theCommittee on that point.    Lord Thomson:   You have  to consider the question of land lines.  Are you satisfied  with the land  lines which you have  gotalready in  South Africa?    Mr. Vyvyan: The land  lines  between Johannesburg and Cape-town are not  good.    They are  always  talking about making thelines better, but they have  not yet done so.  In the future it maybe considered desirable, or necessary,  to make a new station, say, inJohannesburg,  which would carry out both telegraphic  and tele-phonic connection.    Lord Thomson : I want to  go  back, if I may,  to one of our firstpoints,  these large and small aerials.   From your experience offoreign  stations, do they use large or small aerials ?    Marchese  Marconi: Certain  foreign  countries  have  got ouraerials and they are using large  ones.  I have already  stated here that services in foreign countries were  started with small aerialsand they all seem to  be coming to the larger aerials.   They were started with small aerials  and  the services  were bad compared with british  services.   Now they  are  certainly putting up  larger and larger aerials.    Lord Thomson: In,  we will say, France and Italy ?    Marchese MarconiIn France and Italy; in Italy they are put-ting up our aerials.   In France  they  have got our  aerials.   Thuyhad small  aerials of  their  own,  but now they are making  themlarger and  larger. That is  my experience.    Lord Thomson: And Germany ?    Marchese Marconi: In Germany, I think, they have  got our sizeaerials, much  the same height as our own, I am told.    Mr.  Franklin: They are going to  the  biggest aerials they can afford.    Lord Thomson: The tendency is to the big aerial ?    Mr.- Franklin: Yes.    Marchese Marconi:  Of  course, in the beginning of my  work.the idea of a big aerial was scoffed at and laughed at generally by
many  technical experts,  who  said the  Beam did not  exist,  andwould not help.  It is absolutely wasting the time of the Committee,but I have a lot of evidence on that point.   Lord Thomson: Could you  give us some evidence on that pointin writing; it would  be useful ?   Marchese Marconi: Yes,  I can do that  in the course of a fewdays.   Mr. Pethick Lawrence : I  would like to ask one further question.Of course, wireless telephony to-day is in its infancy and naturallyall round this table we are looking to a  very considerable develop-rnent.   For some  years to come do you visualise any  direct corn-petition between wireless telephony and  wireless telegraphy ?   Marchese Marconi: I  think there is  always  a certain competi-tion  between telephony and telegraphy, but I  do not  think the onemethod of  communication is  going to oust the  other.   I  think,especially in the case of the  Dominions  and countries where thereis a large difference of time, the use of telephony will be much lessthan telegraphy.   In ordinary life, when one wants  to give infor-mation or get facts from correspondents in other parts of the world,one does not always want to  speak to them or hear their voice.  Ifyou  are  booking rooms in a hotel you send a telegram.  You donot necessarily want  to speak to the manager.  There are hundreds of other cases,  especially where documents  are required,  whentelegraphy is preferable.  Of course, the Post  Office know ail about that, better  than anybody else.   Lord Thomson: If  no other members of  the Committee have further questions to put, I think that will satisfy us for the moment.I want to present  my gratitude for your attendance again.   If theMarchese Marconi  could give us in writing some of the point we have raised, especially the  last one,  I should be very  grateful.   Are youquite satisfied, Gentlemen, that you have expounded all the  pointsyou want to make  ?   Sir Basil Blackett: I  think the papers  contain  and the cross-examination contains  all we desire to  put before you.  We desire tohold ourselves entirely at the disposal of this Committee to give the mall possible information.   Chairman: Thank you very much.                         CONCLUSIONS.   It was agreed to ask the Marchese Marconi and Sir  Basil Blackettto be  so kind as  to  forward to the  Committee,  for their  furtherinformation, a paper amplifying the following points discussed atthe  meeting:    (a.) The development of  the large aerial from the smaller type          and the extent to  which the large aerial is now used in          other countries  in preference to  the small one : with          particular  regard to experience in  America.   (b.) The  actual  cost  of  a transmitter of  the  Marconi type          complete with plant, &amp;c. capital cost, and the average          annual  upkeep cost  of  the above.  These figures to be          representative  of  the  complete  cost  of  installing,          ab initio, one channel of communication.   (c.) An estimate showing, comparatively, the cost  to a Dominion          n  employing I. &amp;  I.

Memorandum  on  the  various  Methods whereby  Imperial  and  International    Communications  (Limited) can  Co-operate  ivith the  British Post Office  in    providing  Services of  Wireless  Telephony  by means of  the existing Beam    Telegraph Stations.Proposal 1.    THE conversion of the existing transmitters and receivers on the Imperial BeamStations to multiplex working with one channel only for telegraphy and one channelfor telephony, thus utilising a communication band of not more than 13,000 cycles.    Under this proposal, Imperial and International Communications  guaranteesthe following average hours of service per day taken over the whole year :                                                               Hours.Canada    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    13South Africa        ...       ...       ...       ...    19India      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    19Australia  ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    13    Imperial  and  International Communications proposes  that it  should  beresponsible to the Post Office for conducting the wireless side of the Services, thePost Office being responsible for the maintenance  of the land lines connecting the wireless stations with the London Central  and the extensions to subscribers;  andthat the remuneration of Imperial and International Communications,  under thisproposal, should be on the following basis :     A rental of  11,000 per annum,  plus a proportion  of 20  per cent, of the gross        British receipts, with  a combined minimum of  25,000 per annum.    For the purpose of assessing the income proper to the Company under the above proposal, an estimate  must be made of the income which each of the services is likelyto earn in the first few years.  It is accordingly assumed, in these calculations, thatan average of 20 three-minute calls per channel per day for 300 days per annum isas much as can be  expected, and that a fair fee  on which  the service should be initiated is  6 for three minutes with the Dominions and India.    On this basis, the income  at the British end of the four main services would amount to  72,000 per annum  and,  on the above  basis, a rental  of  11,000 plus20  per cent,  of  the gross British receipts, would give to  the  Company  25,400,leaving  46,600 for the Post Office.&apos;Proposal 2.     The provision of separate  transmitters for telephony for  each circuit, working on the existing Beam aerials.     Under this proposal,  Imperial and International  Communications  guaranteesthe following average hours of service per day taken over the whole year :                                                               Hours.Canada    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    16South Africa        ...       ...       ...       ...    20India      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    20Australia  ...       ...       ...       ...       ...    15    Owing to the increased expenditure, both as to capital and  running costs,necessitated by the provision of separate transmitters, the Company considers thatits remuneration under this proposal should be as follows :     A rental of   33,000 per annum plus  10 per cent, of the gross British receipts,        with a combined minimum of  40,000.    The income  is assessed under the same assumption as in Proposal No. 1.  TheCompany&apos;s share under this proposal would amount to  40,200 per annum,  leavingto the Post Office  31,800.       [20612]                                                         G
Proposal 3.    The provision of separate transmitters for each wavelength on each circuit, withthe exception of Australia, which works with only one wavelength.    Under  this proposal,   Imperial  and International  Communications,  Ltd.,increases its guarantees as follows : -                                                              Hours.             Canada    ..        ...       ...      ...       ...     17             South Africa  .      ...       ...      ...       ...     21             India      ...        ...       ...  .....       ...     21             Australia   ...        ...       ...      ...       ...     15These guarantees being the average daily number of hours taken over the whole year.     The Company proposes that its remuneration under this alternative should beas follows :      A rental of  38; 000 per annum plus 10 per cent, of the gross British receipts,         with a combined minimum of  45,000  per annum.The income is again assessed under the same assumption as in Proposal No. 1.  TheCompany&apos;s&apos; share under this proposal would amount to  45,200 per annum, leavingto the Post Office  26,800.     The proposals are put forward in the form of a rental plus a proportion of the gross receipts,  as  it is felt that a rental basis is not by itself a satisfactory one tothe Company,,  as  it does  not  secure to the  Company  an increasing interest in theservice which it has done  so much to develop and will in the future develop.     The above proposals entail no capital expenditure on the part of the Pbst Office,except in the provision of the necessary land lines and the installation at the CentralTelephone Office in London of the landline linking devices.     The  amounts  put  forward as remuneration to Imperial and : InternationalCommunications, Ltd.,  cover interests on the capital expenditure plus depreciation,and the running costs for operating and maintaining the transmitting and receivingstations.     It may be pointed out that, on  the development of the services  beyond  theone-hour&apos;s paid time per  day  (i.e.,  20 three-minute calls per circuit for 300 daysper year), the Post Office income will increase in very much greater proportion thanthat of  the Imperial and International  Communications,  Ltd.  As an  example ofthe respective earnings, assuming double the number of calls, the comparative shareswould be :                                                 Post Office     Proposal No. 1                                          1 hour per service per day ...      &quot;...      46,600         2 hours per service per day ...       ...     104,200    Proposal No.  2          1 hour per service per day...       ...      31,800         2 hours per service per day ...       ...      96,600     Proposal  No. 3          1 hour per service per day... .      ...      26,800         2 hours per service per day ...       ...      91,600     The services rendered under each of the above proposals cover a single telephonechannel  to each of the  Dominions.  If traffic conditions show the necessity for anadditional channel, the number of calls  must have.been greatly augmented beyondthe 20 calls per day which has served as the basis  on which the revenue has been assessed, in which case the Company would be  prepared,  on suitable  terms, to  putdown such additional channels as the needs of the service may require.     Any estimate presented by the Post Office should take into account all  relativeitems, such as cost  of  providing full-size beam  aerials,  depreciation,  interest on capital,  and development  and  research.I.  &amp; I.C.      25,400 39,80040,20047,40045,20052,400
       The Capital Cost and Running Expenses of Separate Stations of the                                 Marconi Type.    In regard to Question (&amp;),* we assume that this refers to a transmitting station and receiving station with the full Beam  aerials that we  recommend, erected on different sites in England, and  that the price is to cover the buildings, a full two-bayaerial on each wave-length, power plant, and all running machinery and auxiliaries.    It is likewise assumed that  the telephone terminal unit for linking up to theland-line  would also be provided  by  us, but  installed in  the  Central  TelephoneExchange, where, it is assumed,  a supply of auxiliary power would be available.    The estimate presented herewith is also  based on the provision  of  duplicaterunning  machinery and adequate spare  plant.    The case considered is hypothetical, and  without knowledge of the particularsite and local conditions an absolutely definite figure cannot be calculated.    In giving the price I desire to draw attention to the fact that the cost per circuitin a single station must essentially be greater  than the cost  per circuit where, as isthe case in the offers actually  made by  I &amp; I.. C, Ltd., two or more transmittersand two or more receivers are  grouped together * in the same buildings, and where,therefore, capital cost and running expenses are shared.    Alternatives have been considered in this estimate, and. the capital cost in eachis as follows :                                                                             (1) A self-contained  station with  its own  power plant and           running  machinery in duplicate,  with  one transmitter           designed to work on one day wave and one night wave,           and receiving gear, with 5 masts and 4 full-size  bays of           aerial, similar to those at the Beam stations, both at the           transmitting station and receiving station, feeder system           and buildings    ...      ...       ...      ...       ...    112,000    (2) As in (1), but with provision for utilising an outside power           supply, and without power plant   ...      ...       ...     93,000    (3) As in (1), but with separate transmitters for the day wave           and the  night wave      ...      \..      ...       ...    124,000    (4) As in (3), but with provision for utilising an outside power           supply, and without power plant   ...      ...       ...    104,000    (5) Two transmitters  and receivers as in (1) for two separate           telephone circuits, run jointly in the same buildings  ...    191,000    The  annual running costs, omitting depreciation and  interest on capital, are estimated at:                                                                              Schemes (1) and (3) as above      ...      ...       ...     22,000         Schemes (2) and (4) as above      ...      ...       ...     18,000    If, however, plant for two  circuits were installed at the same station, the running costs are estimated at:          &apos;             .,                              &apos;            .   ..&apos;-         Schemes (1) and (2)..........       ...     28,000         Schemes (2) and (4)       ...       ...      .....      .....   24,000See p. 40, Conclusion (6), of Appendix B.[20612]G 2

Com/G/1.Dear Dr. Smith,     Professor Howe,                                       December 24, T929.    I am directed by Lord Thomson to inform you that a Cabinet Committee, ofwhich he is the Chairman, is  at  present engaged on an investigation of certain matters in connection with the future of wireless telephony.    From the evidence which has been put  before the Committee, it  is apparent that there are two schools of thought in regard to the direction in. which the futured development of the science of wireless telephony will tend.    Two separate and distinct systems have been placed before the Committee, and,although Lord Thomson feels sure that you are more familiar with them than he is,they may be described briefly as follows :                                                   Post Office System.                                          (b) The adoption  of  a small directive                                        aerial combined with considerably more                                        power in transmission.  This  type of                                        aerial, which is mounted on masts  of a                                        height of 180 feet or under and having a                                        span of 500 feet for each wave-length, is,                                        as regards capital cost,  very considerably                                        cheaper  than the type  described in (a).                                         For  this system it  i-s  claimed  that,                                        although the aerial is  1-7  times  less                                        effective  than the larger  type, so  far as                                        transmission is concerned, the additional                                        power  available  in the  transmitter                                         approximately  2-3 times that available                                        under system (a) gives an overall power                                        equal to 50 per cent, more than that of the                                        large aerial system.   When this difference                                        in power is combined  with  the losses in                                        the  &quot; Multiplex&quot;   system,  the  overall                                        power  available  for   telephony  under                                        system (b) is nearly six times greater  than                                        under system (a).    In addition to, and arising directly out of these two major considerations, aretwo other points on which the Committee would seek your guidance. These  pointsmay be described briefly as follows :            Marconi System.  (a)  The adoption of a.large directiveaerial combined with comparatively lowpower in  transmission.   This  aerial,which is mounted on masts of a height of287 feet and having a span of 1,300 feetfor each wave-length, is, in the first place,an item of considerable capital expense.It is  claimed  for it,  however, that  thelarge  span is essential in order to reduceliability to interference, to get the maxi-mum  amount  of  concentration and toensure, in consequence, greater stability of communication.   This system can beused  either with a transmitter  of  the&apos;&apos; Multiplex &apos;&apos;    type combined   tele-graphy and telephony-or  with separatetransmitters for each channel of commu-communication.           Marconi System.  (1) On the other hand, it is stated defi-nitely that  sufficient  power  is  alwaysavailable  to   give  reasonably  efficientresults, that the &quot; Multiplex&quot; system isbeing improved and  will give  still betterresults, arid finally that no spreading ofwave bands need  or should  occur savethrough maladjustment.           Post Office System.  (i)  It is suggested, on the one hand,that  the   &quot; Multiplex &quot;  system,  asemployed  under (a), besides being liableto give,  at certain periods, unsatisfactoryresults due to insufficient power  becauseof the division  between telegraphy andtelephony,  is also liable to cause  spread-ing of the wave bands,  with consequentinterference  to  other  stations.   It  is claimed that the  improvement  of the&quot;Multiplex&quot;  transmitter  to  reduceinterference will mean a considerable lossof efficiency.  (ii) A development of  wireless tele-phony, known as &apos;&apos; single side band trans-mission,&quot;  is likely to play an important part in future efficiency by increasing thepower available  for  transmission  somefive times.
    The Committee are faced then, by two divergent views; and since these opinionsare backed by authorities of such standing that they are entitled to every respect,difficulty  is  felt in pronouncing judgment  on one  side  or the other  without consulting an independent witness or witnesses.    Lord Thomson  would be  most grateful,&apos; therefore, if you  would  give  theCommittee the benefit of your wide experience, and answer the following questions :     1. Of the two  systems described briefly in (a)  and (b) above, which  in your          opinion, from a technical and scientific point of view, do you consider is          likely to prove the mosfeffective ?    2. Can  you say whether  the &quot;Multiplex&quot;  system of transmission is liable to          cause interference by spreading of wave bands?    3. Is the development and application  of  &quot; single side  band transmission &quot;          likely, in the  future, to  improve the efficiency of wireless telephony by          increasing greatly the power available  for  transmission  and also by          minimising distortion?    It is realised&apos; fully  that it may be difficult for you, at the present stage ofdevelopment, to express a definite opinion; at the same time it is hoped that you maybe able to give the  Committee a forecast on which it can predict, with reasonableaccuracy, the line on which we think this development should be encouraged.    I need hardly add that your report will be treated  in the strictest confidence,and that the Committee also ask that this letter may be treated similarly by you.  Ifyou desire any further information on any points, perhaps you would be kind enoughto address them to me as Secretary to the Committee.    Lord Thomson also asks me to say that he would be  most extremely grateful ifyou could forward your reply not later than the 14tb January, 1930.    I have addressed a similar letter to Dr. F. E. Smith, C.B., C.B.E., F.R.S., D.Sc,A.R.C.Sc, Department  of  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research,  16,  Old QueenStreet,  S.W., as the Committee felt that, in an important matter of this  kind,whoever was consulted would be glad of the support and collaboration of a scientificcolleague.

Department of Scientific and Industrial Research,                                 16, Old Queen Street, Westminster, S.W. 1,Hear Hodsoll,                               January 13, 1930.     WE enclose, for Lord Thomson&apos;s information, a joint reply to  the questionscontained in your letter of the 21st December, 1929.  We  think Lord  Thomson willlike to  know  that,  in the first  instance, we  considered  the questions  quiteindependently, but finding, at a subsequent conference, that our conclusions were incomplete agreement,  we  thought Lord  Thomson  would  prefer a  single report,knowing that we were in absolute agreement.  We trust  the information which isnow forwarded will be helpful to Lord Thomson in coming to a final conclusion.

                                  ENCLOSURE.                           Answers to the  Questions. (Secret.)     In^answering the first question, it has been assumed that by &quot;effective&quot; is meant &quot;capable of  providing satisfactory telephonic communication between two points for a given number of hours per  day, interference with or by other communi- cations not being taken into account.&quot;  In the second question it has been assumed that the waveband  theoretically  required  for  a given number of channels in  a. multiplex system can be allotted, and that it is required to know whether interference is caused by the multiplex system outside such an allotted  waveband.  &quot;We have not in  our answer  considered whether  a multiplex  system  requires a  wider total waveband than the simplex systems which it replaces.     It is desired to  make the general observation that multiplex working or single sideband working can be applied without reference to the size or nature of the aerial system employed.  With respect to the  two aerial systems  (a) and (b) referred to in the Secretary&apos;s letter of the 24th December,  1929, there is no scientific or technical reason why single sideband working should not be used with aerial  system (a) or multiplex working with system (&amp;). Answer to Question 1.     From the restricted point of view  of  signal strength  at the receiver, it would appear immaterial  from the theoretical standpoint  whether this is  obtained  by increasing the power output of the transmitting apparatus or by increasing the con- centration of  a  smaller  available power by  using a more efficient directive aerial system.     Considering the two systems (a) and (b) at  their present stage of development, it is believed that  any deficiency in   directivity of  the  Post Office aerial array compared with the Marconi array can be compensated for by increased power in the transmitting apparatus so as to make both systems equally effective in providing an adequate signal strength at  the receiving station.   On the technical side,  this is purely an economic question.  Apart from the signal strength at the receiver itself, however, it is believed that,  on account of interference  amongst stations, develop - ment in the future will lie along the lines of increasing the concentration of  energy in the desired direction and diminishing that in all other  directions, by improving the efficiency of aerial arrays in this respect.   There appears to be no reason  for supposing that an effective aerial array would need masts over 180 feet  in  height, and there is no  doubt that the cost of  masts increases very rapidly when they  are over 200  feet in height.   The Marconi Company were pioneers in beam development, and the Marconi beam stations already erected  are handicapped somewhat by this fact.  The Post Office system of aerial arrays being carried on lower masts could, therefore, probably be made more effective than the Marconi array at a lower capital cost.  A  brief answer to the first question is, therefore,  that, apart from  future development, both systems are probably equally capable of providing satisfactory telephonic communication between two points for a given number of hours per day. interference with or by other communications not  being taken  into account  at  the moment.  The actual amount of energy required for any particular communication can only  be satisfactorily settled by a lengthy series of reception tests.  As regards future developments, we think that the adoption of the more elastic  aerial system, namely, that with the lower masts, would be advantageous, since equally satisfactory results could be attained with a smaller expenditure of money.Answer to Question  2.    The  answer  to the second question is that measurements carried out during  the tests with the Marconi  multiplex system showed that the system as tested didproduce  interference on frequencies outside the wave  band  nominally  occupied.From a study of the undesired frequencies observed at a station about 500 miles fromthe transmitter, it would  appear that these were partly  due  to the existence ofharmonics in the fundamental frequencies of the two telegraph bands, and  partly to the intermodulation of the  fundamental frequencies of these two bands.   There isno theoretical reason why the harmonics should not be eliminated; and, further, it is      [20612]                                                          H
understood that the Marconi Company propose to employ only one telegraph channel.This latter  fact eliminates the possibility of the observed intermodulation betweenthe two telegraph  channels.  The question of the sufficiency of  powers for a givencommunication  is  again,  in the present state of our knowledge, a question ofexperiment.Answer to Question 3.     Single side-band transmission is an ideal to be aimed at not only from the pointof view of increasing the effective power received, but also of limiting, the band offrequencies  occupied by the communication.   It  is considered  that this  latter question far outweighs all  questions of the saving,  of power.    Single  side-bandworking should theoretically decrease distortion, but  without further experimentalevidence it is impossible to be categorical on this point.  It is also probable that the suppression and local replacement of the carrier wave in  single side-Band workingwould reduce fading.  It is also thought that the technical development involved inthe realisation of single side-band working would make it possible to employ variousdevices  for providing for secrecy in radiotelephonic communications.  It thereforeseems desirable that the research necessary to achieve single,  side-band working.should be pushed on with the greatest energy, as this method is likely in the future to improve efficiency.                              Further Comments.     In  presenting the answers to the three questions, we have considered the factors to be taken  into account in designing  a transmitting system for  short-wave radiotelephony.  These factors are as follows :      (a)  Attenuation  or absorption of  the waves  in  their  passage  from  the          transmitter to the receiver.     (&amp;)  Constancy  of the frequency of the wave modulated.     (c)  Effects due to the  interference of waves passing by various routes through          the intervening medium.     (d)  The disturbance produced by &quot; echoes &apos;&apos; due to waves which have travelled,          for example, by the opposite direction round the earth to that taken by          the main signal wave.     (e)  Disturbance by atmospherics.     (/)  Disturbance by other signals.     To  overcome the effects of attenuation and absorption in  the medium,  it isnecessary to use either  an adequate non-directed output from a generating systemor a  smaller output from the  generating  system, concentrated  into the desireddirection by a directive aerial array.  Apart from interference with other stations,the choice between these  two methods is  purely economic, that is to say,  that,provided sufficient power is applied to a non-directive aerial, equally adequate signalstrength would be,received at a distant station without making use of a directiveaerial system at all.  A difficulty frequently arises from the varying attenuation ofdifferent wavelengths, and  to meet  this it  is often found desirable to change thewavelength  in  use according to the.time  of day.   Provision for  such  choice ofwavelengths is likely to be more cheaply made with a relatively low mast system.     In  short-wave  telephony very objectionable distortion can be  produced.   It isbelieved that the Post Office regard  lack of frequency stability (factor (b) above) asthe main cause of  distortion, and state that, with improved control of the carrierfrequency, distortion has  been  found  to vanish.   The Marconi  Company,  while accepting the importance  of frequency stability,  would  appear  to consider that considerable distortion is produced by the interference of waves coming by differentroutes through the medium (factor  (c)  above).   The control of  frequency stabilityobviously does  not depend on- the  aerial system employed.  On  the  other  hand,interference effects classed under (c). would be less likely to be produced provided avery concentrated.beam was employed, since the area of the Heaviside layer on whichthe beam was  reflected would be. very considerably  reduced, and, therefore,  the chance  of  waves  interfering  due  to  a   difference  in   their  paths  would  be correspondingly less.  At the same time, the few independent measurements whichhave been made upon the radiation from the Marconi  beam system would appear toshow that, as at present designed, the concentration in one direction is not sufficient
to obviate  the  chance of distortion being produced by interference effects of thekind under discussion if they exist to any appreciable extent.  The same is true ofthe Post Office system.  If further experience, however,  shows that such.interferenceis appreciable,  then it would appear  that1 it can only be reduced by the use of moreconcentrated beams than have yet been employed.    The subject of &quot;echoes &quot; has received very great attention abroad,  and Germanexperts have stated  that the existence  of back radiation from  the  beam system which, in their opinion,  is the radiation which produces the &quot;echo,&quot; sets a definitelimit to the speed  of signalling.  Neither the Post Office nor the Marconi Companyappear to attach very much importance  to these  &quot;echo&quot; effects.   It is quite clear,however, from  the data obtainable that both aerial arrays, as  at present used, giverise to considerable back radiation, and  therefore, if the AUEWS of foreign expertsare accepted, are both liable  to give rise to defects due to &quot;echoes.&quot;  The  effect ofthese  &apos;&apos; echoes &apos;&apos; at the receiving station  can, of  course, be overcome by a directiveaerial system which does not accept radiation from the backward  direction.   Echosignals may, of course, also be produced  by radiation leaving the transmitter  in the forward direction  and travelling more than once round the world.    The problem of atmospheric disturbances affects the transmitting aerial designonly in so far as it demands  the production at the receiver of signals exceeding theminimum value required to overcome the noise due to atmospheric disturbance. Themitigation of atmospheric disturbances  requires the use of receiving aerials blindto the direction of maximum disturbance.  This may  involve  the  receiving aerialsbeing placed in a  poor direction for the reception of the transmitted  signals, andto overcome this difficulty an  increase  of the  necessary  signal strength may berequired.   As  in the case of factor (a)  above, this  can be applied either by betterconcentration of a restricted power or  by  an  increase of power  without specialconcentration.    As regards interference  to other signals, this, in so far as it  IS determined bysignal strength, as  opposed to the much more important factor of wave band occupied,can only be restricted by the best  possible concentration of energy in  the  requireddirection.  Increase  of power to compensate  for bad concentration accentuates thedifficulty.  The mitigation of atmospheric disturbance is primarily a question of thewave band occupied.  In general it may be stated that the probability of disturbanceby natural or  artificially generated  signals grows  with the width of wave bandoccupied.   The single side band system  not only occupies less than half the waveband of the ordinary system, but the strong carrier  wave with its great interferingproperties  is eliminated, and on these  grounds it  is  of  the  greatest importance.The ideal would probably be multiplex working with  a single side band system.  It is,therefore,  desired  to emphasise  that no antithesis as between &quot;single side bandversus multiplex&quot; is valid except  on possible grounds  of  immediate practicability.

WIRELESS TELEPHONY AS FAR AS IT AFFECTS THE DOMINIONS.Memorandum from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the  Colonies.    THE issue before the Committee is understood to be as follows :  The Post office are conducting  a wireless telephone service with New York  from Rugby both on thelong wave and the short wave.  The only long-wave station,  other  than that atRugby, which is suitable for communication on the  long wave is understood to be thatin New York, and there is little prospect of anjr other long-wave station now being set up anywhere else in the world.  The Post Office have the  right to use the Marconibeam stations for short-wave wireless telephony (Clause V of the Lease of the BeamStations page 62  of Cmd. 3338), but  an alternative is to develop the separateshort-wave  service,  and,  if the  Rugby station is equipped for  this purpose,  ashort-wave service can  be given from there.   This system  is understood to imply,.       [20612]                                                        H 2
 -at any rate so far as North America is concerned, collaboration with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.  On the other hand, the existing Marconi beam telegraph stations  in  this country are claimed by Imperial  and International Communications,  Limited, to be  capable  of  providing a satisfactory wireless telephone service  in direct  communication with the  corresponding beam stations in the Dominions and  elsewhere.     For the purposes of direct communication with the Dominions, any service from -or to the United Kingdom must be operated in association with stations established in each of them, and the question arises as  to whether the proposals of  the General Post Office would necessitate the  establishment of new stations in each  of the Dominions, and,  if so, whether  the  Dominion Governments would agree to the establishment  of  such  new  stations.   If new stations  are  not necessarv in the Dominions and existing systems can be utilised or adapted to communicate with the Post Office short-wave  station  established at Rugby, working arrangements in the Dominions would presumably be required with existing interests who are already directly  or indirectly associated with Imperial and  International Communications, Limited.     The following is a short resume of such  facts relating to each Dominion as seem to have a bearing  upon the question at issue. Canada.     The only  licences at present held in Canada to operate trans-Atlantic wireless, either for telegraph or telephone purposes, are in the hands of the Canadian Marconi Company. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada informed His Majesty&apos;s Govern- ment in the United Kingdom  in 1927 that they  would &quot;welcome the establishment of a radio-telegraph service between Great  Britain and Canada, but would much prefer that that service should be established directly between  stations in Great Britain and stations in Canada, rather than through the medium of stations in the United States.&quot; At the present moment the  Post Office are in telephone communica- tion with Canada through  the station of the American Telephone and  Telegraph Company at New York, and a despatch Avas sent to the Canadian Government on the 29th July, 1929, giving a summary of the results of telephone experiments by meansof the direct Marconi beam system which had recently been carried out between this country and Canada, and inviting that Governments views generally again on the whole question.  A copy of this despatch is annexed.  The Canadian Government replied in September that the whole matter  was under consideration and that  they hoped to express their views shortly.A australia.     The wireless services in Australia are  operated by Amalgamated Wireless ofAustralia, of whose  shares the majority are held by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the  Commonwealth of Australia.  In the course of  the negotiations for the cable and Wireless Merger in this country, Mr. Bruce  took very strongly the line that the control of all  telegraphic communications  in  Australia  and  of  any developments must rest in Australia.  It  therefore seems  likely that the Commonwealth Govern-ment would wish any station in Australia to be operated by Amalgamated Wireless, Limited.  It may  be added that  this Company and  Imperial and International Communications, Limited,  have been in negotiation  for unifying their interests in Australia, but the Secretary of State is not aware whether any agreement has jetbeen arrived at.     A recent  Select Committee of  the Senate  recommended,  inter alia, that allwireless stations should be owned by the Government and that all  oversea telephonic communication should be under Government control, but this does  not  necessarily imply a control other than that exercised over Amalgamated Wireless, Limited..New Zealand.     Sir Joseph Ward&apos;s Government has pronounced in  the  Dominion Parliament against the policy  involved in  forming the Cable and Wireless Merger.  But, so far as is known, no action has  followed on this pronouncement, and the Secretary ofState has no information as to its possible bearing on the operation of a long-distancewireless station in New Zealand.&quot;                                -       .  ,
Union of South Africa.    Imperial and International Communications, Limited, is in negotiation withthe Wireless Telegraph Company of South Africa for an amalgamation of interests.This has been agreed to, in principle, by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Unionof South  Africa on  the understanding that cable and wireless rates should beequalised  at something lower than the present wireless tariff.  The Secretary ofState has  not heard what has been the result of these stipulations, nor whether theCompany&apos;s licence extends to the conduct of a long-distance telephone service.New foundland.    His Majesty&apos;s Government in Newfoundland have recently been empowered byan act of the local legislature to enter into a contract with the American telephone and Telegraph Company for the landing of a telephone cable in Newfoundland, andthe Company has undertaken to provide a telephone service between newfoundland and the mainland of North America and between Newfoundland and Europe. *    In the report of the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference, 1928, it was made clear  that the General  Post Office  reserved  the right to  conduct the externaltelephonic services of Great Britain, but was to agree with the Merger Company,the terms  on which it would have  the right to use the leased wireless beam stationsor portions thereof  for such  purposes.   It is difficult to deduce from  this reportanything material as to the probable attitude of the Dominion Governments towardsthe alternative proposals now under  discussion for the conduct of  a wireless tele-phone system, except in  so far as the principles which  the report was designed toestablish would be affected by adoption of a system which involved, at  any rate tosome  extent, working in collaboration with a foreign company in a matter so closelyaffecting Inter-Imperial Communications.    No system of wireless telephone communication can be established with theDominions  in the  future  unless arrangements  are  made  with  each dominion government as to the corresponding  system of  communications to be set up withinthe territory for which they are responsible.  But Dominion Governments would nothave  ground for  commenting upon any  decision which might be  reached by HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in the United Kingdom for entrusting the operation of external wireless telephony in this country to the General Post Office or  to imperial and  International Communications, Limited,  except in so  far as  that decisionaffected the  corresponding arrangements for  reception and  transmission in each dominion, and so far as it was likely to retard or promote  the development of an efficient direct service.  These points necessarily involve technical considerations.     If the Cabinet Committee desires  to ascertain  the views of  the  DominionGovernments  before preparing their  report, it is suggested that these governments should be invited to select representatives who could explain their views informally to the Committee.  Such preliminary consultation will, however, not dispense withthe  need of making  the arrangements with each Dominion  Government  already referred to above.     It may be  added that,  before  Imperial and  International Communications, Limited,  could adopt a  scheme involving the use of the Beam stations  for wirelesstelephony purposes,  they  would  presumably  have   to  consult  the   Imperial Communications  Advisory  Committee  in  accordance  with  Clause XX of  theTreasury Agreement of the 29th May, 1929. Canada.  No. 441.  Confidential. Sir,                                             Downing  Street,  July 29, 1929.     With reference to  my predecessors Confidential despatch No.  74 of the 1st February, and to your Confidential  despatch No. 89  of the 4th March, I have the honour to transmit, for  the information of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada, a summary of the results of the telephony experiments, by means of the Marconi  Beam system, which have recently been  carried out between this country and  Canada.  It will  be seen  that,  during the experimental period, the Beam  system afforded a telephone  service comparing  not  unfavourably,  as regards  stability  and efficiency,    * It may also be noted in connection with the question of a trans-Atlantic telephone  cable, that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada were informed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in July 1929, that financial arrangements were being  considered under which half a share in the cable would he come the property of the General Post Office.
with that given by the short-wave  channel  at present in use in the Transatlantic-public telephone service.    2.   As explained, however, in Mr. Amery&apos;s  Confidential despatch No. 74 of the1st February (paragraphs 3 and 4), short-wave radio-telephony has not yet reached a degree of reliability sufficient to  enable a telephone service wholly dependent on short-wave radio connection to compete in efficiency with an existing service in whichstability is maintained at a high level by the combination of a long-wave channelwith short-wave channels.  Unless, therefore,  the existing Anglo-American long-wave radio link continues to be available as a stand-by, a direct short-wave Anglo-Canadian telephone service would be definitely inferior to that at present provided and, moreover,  would exclude the  whole  of Western Canada from the existingbenefits of communication with Europe until the &quot; all-Canadian &quot; telephone route tothe Pacific coast is completed.     3.   In  this connection, I enclose,  for the confidential information  of HisMajesty&apos;s  Government in Canada, a copy of correspondence which has  passed between the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and the Bell TelephoneCompany of Canada^   It will be seen that the former Company  have decided  to discontinue the New York routing  of Anglo-Canadian traffic if and when a directservice  is opened,  and, consequently,  the Anglo-American  long-wave channel wouldriot be  available to provide service  between Europe arid  Canada  when the directchannel failed.    4.   Moreover, the relative inferiority of a direct Anglo-Canadian short-waveradio-telephone service, unsupported by  the Anglo-American service, would become-more marked with the  provision of an Anglo-American telephone cable, which would materially improve the stability of the existing service.  No definite decision as tothe provision of a  cable has yet been taken, but it may now be regarded as a practicalquestion,  and  experimental lengths are being manufactured for the  AmericanTelephone and Telegraph Company. .... .  5,   As regards the financial aspect of a direct service,  it should be pointed outthat the volume of traffic at present passing between  Canada and  Europe does notexceed  500 paid minutes per month.   It is  economical to carry this traffic over  theexisting Anglo-American radio-telephone route,  as spare capacity  is available andno appreciable additional costs are  involved. The opening of a direct service wouldinvolve the British Post Office in  considerable additional expenses without anycompensatory increase in revenue and, regarded as  a commercial  proposition,  themaintenance of the existing  service via New  York would be the  most attractivepolicy.     6.  But the Postmaster-General would  not  refuse, on grounds of cost alone, toco-operate in  a   direct service  if the  Canadian Government  so desire  and  if satisfactory arrangements can be made with the Imperial Communications company for obtaining the necessary facilities at the Beam stations.  He thinks, however,that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada may now  wish to consider the question from the  standpoint of the telephone user, having regard to the deterioration of theservice which  the substitution  of a  single short-wave channel for  the facilities available via New York would entail, and he would be glad to receive their views ofthe matter.                                                           I have, &amp;c.                                                  (Signed)       PASSFIELD.The Secretary of State for      External Affairs, Canada.
           Memorandum from the Imperial Communications Committee.    From the purely strategic aspect, there are three points  to which the Committeewould desire to draw attention, and which have  some bearing on the future controlof wireless telephony services in Great Britain.   These points are as follows :      (a) In so far as it is possible, without undue influence  on the economic aspect,           it is desirable to avoid  concentrating the whole of the overseas wireless           communication services in this country in one particular site.  In any           future war  it is anticipated that one of the enemy&apos;s  aims will  be  to           destroy, by bomb or such other forms of  attack  as may be possible, the           nerve  centres of communications in this country, and thereby to  hamper           our operations generally.  A large  wireless station  offers, not only an           admirable target, but one which is very easily destroyed by reason of the           delicate nature of its contents.   It is preferable, then, either to locate           the centre, if concentrated,  in such  a position  as will lie outside the           probable  radius of enemy aircraft or bombardment by enemy war vessels           from the sea; or else to disperse the stations, thereby decreasing greatly           the risk of total disablement.    (b) It is laid down at the present time that,  on the imposition of censorship, all           wireless telephony will  be suppressed.  It is understood, however, that           secrecy in this form of communication may be achieved in due course;           and, if this is so, a new and highly valuable asset of strategical importance           may be available in war time.  It is desired to draw attention to this           point, which, although not relevant at present, may be a factor of  great           strategical significance in the future.    -(c) Arising directly out of (&amp;) is the vital need to ensure, by every possible means,           that our overseas wireless links in the  Dominions, Colonies, Protectorates,           Mandated Territories or other countries such as  Egypt in  which we           have important interests, are retained in British hands.  The Committee           regard with grave apprehension  the  efforts  of  American and  French           firms,  especially  in Egypt, to impinge on  British and Imperial circles,           and urge that every  effort  should be made to support&apos; and encourage         :  British wireless enterprise  overseas.   It  is also pointed out that the           greater the control of foreign wireless communications by British con-           cerns,  the more the strategical benefit to us in time of  war.The methods by which these aims may be achieved necessarily involve questions of higher policy with which the Committee is not empowered to deal.    It is desired to  add that the only  British commercial company which appearscapable of meeting and competing overseas on anything like equal terms with foreign interests is the Imperial  and International Communications, Limited,  and  it  isurged  strongly that  every assistance should be given to  this firm to help it in itsefforts to obtain concessions in our overseas dependencies and in foreign countries,that firm being required, in return for such assistance, to perform the  necessaryservice on terms as advantageous with  regard both to price and efficiency  as  thoseoffered by any other responsible Company, or those which the Post Office is preparedto accept for performing the work at the British end.                 Dissent of General Post Office  Representative.    The Post Office representative records his dissent from this Resolution and callsattention to the following facts :     (a) In view  of  the decision of the  Committee  of Imperial  Defence at  its           239th  meeting, that &apos;&apos; it should be laid down in Censorship Regulations           that wireless telephony between this  country and places abroad  will be           prohibited altogether after the institution  of Censorship,&quot; it is difficult           to  maintain that  wireless telephone services are  of great strategical           importance.
(b)  It  is  quite  likely that secrecy  devices  will  be  evolved which  will  give-       reasonable security against &apos;&apos; tapping &apos;&apos; by private individuals, but there-       is no prospect of any device being evolved which would be proof against       tapping by enemy Government wireless and deciphering experts.  There-       is little likelihood, therefore, of the reversal  of  the  OLD. decision  to       prohibit the working of wireless telephone services in  war time.(c)  The site of the Rugby station has always been  admitted to be good from       the strategical point of view, whereas the sites of  the beam stations have       always been admitted to be defective from the strategical point of view.       It is better, therefore, that the telephone services to the Dominions should       be worked from.  Rugby rather than that both telegraph  and telephone       services to the Dominions should  be concentrated at  the beam stations.(d)  A  Sub-Committee  of the   Imperial  Communications  Committee, which       reported on the beam stations on the 3rd October, 1924 (I.C.C. Paper 790),.       expressed the view that &apos;&apos; the reliance which  can be placed on them for       strategical purposes is slight.&quot;  Another Sub-Committee which reported       on the 27th October, 1927 (LOO  Paper 916),  stated that beam stations       could easily be jammed more easily in fact than &quot; all-round &quot; stations       These views give  no support for  the  transfer  of wireless  telephone       services to the beam system on strategical grounds.(e)  The Imperial Communications Company and its  subsidiary companies have       a strong hold on the cable and wireless telegraph services throughout the       Empire, and there is little risk that wireless  telephone services  in any       strategically important part of the Empire will  fall  into the hands  of       a foreign Company.(/)  The Post  Office, in view of its extensive  telephone  cable  system  to the       Continent and its ownership of the high-power wireless station at Rugby       with  both long-wave  and short-wave transmitters,  has been  able  to       establish  Great Britain  as the centre through  which  every  telephone       message between any part of Europe and  any part of North America       must pass. No Company would have been able to achieve this satisfactory       result.(g)  In view of the importance of Great Britain as a  centre for telephone traffic       (both British and foreign), many important foreign countries will desire       to obtain  direct telephonic communication  with  this  country.  In some       of these countries all international telephone services will be conducted       by the Government themselves (as  in this country), or,  alternatively, by a       Company of their own  nationality.  Where  this  is  not the case and       outside companies  compete for concessions as  in Egypt the British       Government can  assist the Communications Company (1) by diplomatic       support, and (2) by the influence of the British Telephone Administration       with the foreign Telephone Administration concerned.
