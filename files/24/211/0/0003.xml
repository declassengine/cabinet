[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC KAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).                                                       Copy No.SBORBT.                     CABINET.J.P.103C30) .LOCAL AUTHORITIES (ENABLING) BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.          This Bill I-as considered, before Second Reading,by the Cabinet at its meeting on the 5th February, 1930(see  C .8 (30) Conclusion 12).   The Bill received a SecondReading and is likely shortly to come before the StandingCommittee.   The Bill has, of course, no chance of becominglaw, but I have to be ready with amendments for the Corcmitteestage.          The Bill proposes to give power to the Council of everyCounty and of every Borough and Urban District having a population of 20,000 or over &quot;....to establish or purchase orcarry on any business or undertaking within their area havingfor its purpose either the acquisition of gain or the promotion of commerce, art, science, recreation, charity, or any otherobject which might lav/fully be established or carried on by a company, limited or unlimited, or association duly incorporatedand duly acting under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1929&quot;.It further provides that       a council may purchase or holdland within their area in such quantities and for such purposes has they think f it.&quot;          It is not practicable to allow the Bill to proceedwith these provisions as they stand.   The Local authorities would, be enabled to do anything they like, within the law;the reference to the Companies Act provides no substantiallimitation because companies have wide powers of carrying onenterprises under that Act.          Many activities can now be carried on by Local
Authorities subject to provisions in the general law, suchas water supply, gas, electricity, means of transport andthe like;  but under the Bill, a Local Authority might beable to undertake these enterprises free of the present statutory conditions.   The proposed powers with regard to&quot;art&quot; and. &quot;science&quot; might clash with the present law relatingto education and the powers relating to &quot;charity&quot; with those relating to public assistance.          Furthermore, the carrying on of certain enterprisesare subject to  special laws,  such as those relating to bankingand insurance (both of which  could be undertaken by LocalAuthorities if  the Bill were  passed in its present form), and before giving a general power of this kind to Local Authoritiesit would be necessary to go through all the relevant lawsin order to ascertain with what modifications,  if any, theyshould be applied to Local Authorities.          It is no exaggeration to say thati if it were proposedto pass the Bill with its present wide scope, weeks of work would be required to bring it into prbper form;  and, quite apart from other considerations,  there is no time for this work on a Bill  with  no  prospect of becoming law.          I find that the principal enterprises for which LocalAuthorities have sought power in recent years by Local Billshave been the sale of milk and coal and power to manufacture and sell bricks, to develop surplus land by the erection of shops, etc., and to provide entertainments;  and I proposethat the powers of the Bill should be applied to these matters,with the addition of the making and sale of bread.   Someother small matters found in some Local Acts might be added;and it might further be provided that the Minister should have                               -2-
power by Order (the Order to be subject to confirmation.by Parliament if opposed) to grant to a Local Authorityany power which has been granted by Parliament in local acts, subject to any conditions which may have been imposedwhen the power was given;  in this way, the latest decisionsof Parliament could be applied in fresh places by a simpleprocedure.          With regard to the acquisition and use of land,I propose that a provision now freely given to the largertowns by Local Act should be followed, under which the LocalAuthorities are given wide powers to acquire land where thisis desirable for the development of their district.          Question arises whether power to establishMunicipal Savings Banks should be included.   Birminghamestablished such a bank during the war and has sincecontinued it.   Last year, the Council were authorised toextend their ope nations to any area adjoining  the City if theLocal Authority agree.   Many other towns have sought toestablish municipal banks but the Treasury have objected, and none of the applications has been granted until this year,when the House of Commons Committee has passed the clausesgiving these powers to Cardiff.   A Birkenhead Bill of thisyear (which has not yet come before Committee) containssimilar provisions but I understand that the Treasury have asked that the proposal be withdrawn on the ground that theydo not consider that  these powers should be granted to townswhich have not a very  large population or where adequatesavings facilities already exist.   The population ofBirkenhead is about 160,000;  that of Cardiff, 227,000.
          If it be decided to include powers of this kindin the Bill, it might be well to restrict them to county boroughs with a population of not less than, say, 200,000.          It might be prudent also that a limit of 50,000population (instead of 20,000 as in the Bill) be providedfor the general powers, except that places of lesspopulation might be granted the powers by Order, subjectto the confirmation of Parliament if the Order is opposed.                Many  other  questions  arise  on the  Bill,  but  I      need trouble the Cabinet with only  one  of them.    In the      Bill, it  is proposed  that  the Local Authority  shall  not      be empowered to borrow for the  purposes of  the Act      (unless a Provisional Order  is  Issued and passed by      Parliament) if  their  total debt exceeds a fourth  of  the      rateable  valuej  but  the total  debt of  most  large      Authorities already exceeds  many times  the  rateable  value.                I propose that this matter  should  not be      expressed in relation to the total  debt but  that  a limit      of one-twentieth of the rateable value  be inserted for      borrowing under the Bill.                                            (Initialled)  A.G.Ministry  of Health.    21st March,  1930.
