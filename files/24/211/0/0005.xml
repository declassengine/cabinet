THIS yJOOIMMg IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRimUHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.     /?                                                        ^ A     J.C C   tf[            CABINET.             COPY HO.   \) 0.P.105(30) .       UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.               Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.            She Live Register figure for 17th March to be published      this  week will total 1,621,800, or 500,000 more than when      the Government took office.   The new Unemployment Insurance      Act eame into force on 13th March.   Next Friday we shall be      asking Parliament for power to borrow up to another  10,000,000      for the Unemployment Fund.   These things, coming together,      create a situation to which we must give serious thought, but      I  do  not think there is any occasion for fearing that we      cannot meet any criticism to which we may be exposed.            First of all, there is very little connection between      the increase in the Live Register and the new Act.   The      Lord  Privy Seal and I have pointed out that the new Act night      mean  an increase of 100,000, but so far the utmost that can      be attributed to this cause is about 40,000.   And if it be      asked what effect changes in administration apart from the      new Act may have had the answer is much the same - such      changes have brought on less than 10,000 at the outside.      These increases were the anticipated result of our policy      and it does not lie in our mouths to complain of them or to      apologise for them.   It is the policy of the Party to      humanise the Exchanges and to transfer the able-bodied      unemployed, temporarily at any rate, from the Guardians to      the Exchanges, and so far as this policy is successful      it must result in an increase in the registers.
     The new Act,  waa brought Into operation withoutfriction or delay.   There have been a few stories in thepress of Exchanges being besieged by crowds of applicants, but so far as I can discover these stories are substantiallywithout foundation.     The increase of 500,000 in the Live Register since theGovernment took office may be roughly analysed as follows          New A.ct and administrative changes    50,000          Seasonal causes                      200,000          Other depression in trade            250,000Industrial comparison cannot be given for a date later than24th February, at which date the Live Register was 421,000higher than on 24th June, 1929.   The figures for some of themore important industries are as follows:-                              Increase (-?) or decrease (-)                              between 24th June, 1929 and                              24th February, 1930.          Coal. Mining                -  61,700          Building                  -V^ 79,600          Cotton                     -F  58,500          Distributive trades        -4- 46,200          General Engineering        4- 22,900          Hotels, etc.                  20,600          Clothing                   -4- 19,300          Wool                       4  16,600     The increased borrowing power for which  I shall haveto ask on Friday  is required owing to the high registers wehave had since the beginning of the year and  is therefore not due to the new Act.   In  saying this, I ought to add that thenew Act may result in a further increase in the register and higher expenditure otherwise, and if things go badly the newborrowing power may soon  be exhausted:  but so far as we have gone, it will be  easy to  refute any suggestion that we are putting forward next Friday&apos;s proposal on account of the newAct.
       It has &quot;been suggested there may be the possibilityof an all-Party Committee-&quot;&apos;on. unemployment insurance.   I doubtvery much whether this is a feasible plan either forunemployment insurance or for the more general question of theemployment situation.    The new Act    has hardly come intooperation, and it will be months before any figures and experience can lee got to show how it is  -working - we have infact made plans to record figures and experience so that theposition may be reviewed later on, but any inquiry just now would find nothing to enquire into.   Apart from any such considerations I cannot help feeling that any proposals foran all-party Committee at this juncture would be hailed by our opponents as a confession of failure.    They would have no desire to take over any share of our responsibility, and they need not put themselves in the wrong by refusing outright.All they need do is to make stipulations, which we could not agree to without political suicide, for the admission of theirown particular remedies.           So far as next Friday&apos;s Debate is concerned, theChancellor and I believe we can deal with it without the needfor the announcement of any new departure in policy;  indeed,I am not sure that such an announcement would be permitted bythe Chairman of Committees.   The plain point to make is thatthe exhaustion of the unemployment fund is due to an abnormaland unforeseeable increase in unemployment which is world-widein character, that it is in no appreciable degree due to unemployment insurance policy or administration, and that theplan of further borrowing, undesirable though it is, is theonly thing possible in the circumstances, and the one which any government would have adopted..
     There is one other matter to which I should refer,namely, the question of the treatment of the able-bodiedunemployed who do not possess the minimum insurancequalification.   The present position is that as a purely temporary measure these are being transferred nominallyto the Unemployment Fund,  but actually to the Exchequer,which pays the whole cost of their benefits.   This isin effect a transfer of the able-bodied unemployed to central funds with very inadequate safeguards againstabuse and with no ooherent policy  to guide it.   Thismatter, as my colleagues will remember, is at present being considered by the Unemployment. Insurance Committeeof the Cabinet,  but I wish to emphasise that we mustsettle upon a definite policy before the autumn.
