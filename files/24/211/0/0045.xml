           Public Works Loans Bill 1930.    Memorandum by the Financial Secretary  to  the                   Treasury.     (1)  The Public Works Loans Bill is normally takenannually in July or August.   The national Debt end local loans Aot 1087 established the Local Loans Fund for thepurpose of financing the bodies authorised by Parliamentto lend money for local loans.   There is  now only onesuch body, the Public Works Loan Commissioners.     (2)  The Commissioners are appointed  for five years at a times the tern of office of the present  Commissionersexpiring on the 31st March 1931.   Clause  1 of the draftBill roappoints the present Board to serve for a further period of five years.     (3)  The last Public Works Lo-ns Bill was for parliamentary reasons postponed till late  in  the year, andwas only passed in December 1928 instead of August 1928.In vievi of the expected General Flection in 1929 provision( 35 millions) was then made which was estimated to sufficeup to April 1930 some fifteen months.-.  This will be exhausted in a few months time, and a Bill providing forfurther advances is therefore essential this  session.  Theamount proposed in the Bill to be issued is  30 millions which is  estimated to be sufficient to meet requirements upto the end of August of next year (clause  2).     (4)  Under section 15 of the national Debt and local loans Act 1887, the principal of any loan  not likely to be recovered is directed by Parliament to be  written off fromthe assets of the Local Loons Fund and to  be made goodultimately by a Vote of Parliament.  In accordance with this procedure, clause 3 of the Bill authorises the write-off ofunrecoverable balances -amounting to  61 .,901 .,13.0 on certain
loans advanced to certain Scottish Harbours and under theAgricultural Credits Act, 1893,      (5) In some cases it is necessary not only to writeoff all debts from the assets of the fund, but further toremit the debt remaining due to the Exchequer as againstthe borrower..  Thus clause 4 of the Bill provides for there mission of the amounts of principal written off under clause 3, together with the accrued interest.      (6)  Clause 5 provides for the remission of principaland interest in respect of three loans made to certainScottish Harbours many years ago which have already been written off the assets of the local Loans Fund. 1      (7)  Clause 6 provides for the remission of the outstanding interest amounting to  10,189.0vlO. on a loanmade to the Scrabster Harbour Trustees.      (8)  The Bill is an essential Bill arid will in any event be required before the end of the Summer.   TheWhips are anxious that it should be ready for introductionnext week.   It does not usually give rise to controversy in the House.- -
Public  Works  Loans  Bill.           FINANCIAL  MEMORANDUM.     1. Under section 15 of the National Debt and local loans Act, 1887, where  the  whole or  any part  of theprincipal of any local loan is by reason of the  sum notbeing likely to be recovered  directed by  Parliament tobe written off from the Account of Assets of the local loans Fund, the amount of such principal is required tobe  paid to the  National Debt Commissioners  out of moneys provided by Parliament.  Any sums afterwardsrecovered, whether for principal or interest, in respect ofthe  amount  so  written off,  are to be paid  into theExchequer.     2. Clause 3  of  this Bill proposes to write off theprincipal of various loans to the extent of  61,901  13s. Od.and  in accordance With the procedure indicated above this  sum will require to be made good to the Local loans fund by Vote.   The amount will appear in the Vote for repayment to the Local Loans Fund for the  financialyear 1931.     3. As there  is no prospect of  effecting any furtherrecovery of the amounts due from the borrowers clause 4of the Bill  extinguishes the principal  outstanding  andremits all arrears of interest thereon.     4. Clause  5  extinguishes the principal outstandingand  remits  all  arrears of interest  in respect  of threeloans, the principal of  which was written off from the accounts of Assets of the Local Loans Fund in the years1818 to  1887 and 1906 respectively.    5.

The Harbour Commissioners conse-quently fell into arrear with their payments, and in the circumstances the Treasury on 12th December,1914, agreed to a suspension of payments during the peiiod of the War on condition that all surplus revenue was remitted to the Loan Commissioners in reduction of the arrears due to them, and that at the termination of the period of suspension the arrears of interest were capitalised and added to the principal outstanding and fresh annuities calculated. In the year 1921, however, the financial position of the harbour undertaking was such that it became necessary to suspend the loan repayments for a further period and under the terms of such suspension the Fraserburgh Town Council agreed to collect the Burgh rates in the ordinary course from the Harbour Commissioners and pay the same over to the Loan Commissioners direct in reduction of the arrears due on account of the guaranteed harbour loans. Sums - amounting in all to 13,467?. 10s. have been so paid to the Loan Commissioners by the Town Council since 1921. Notwithstanding the last-mentioned pa\ merits the net revenue of the harbo undertaking continues to be insufficiei to discharge in full the payments of tlx recalculated annuities, and on 31 March, [Continued on page v.117,381 13 5	10,826 14 9	38,669 7 1	7,948 8 7	the Treasury, and added to the principal then outstanding .in the accounts of  the PublicCommissioners.133               A 2......................    ^

Unless some financial relief is granted it is feared that the harbour structure will rapidly deteriorate, in which case there will be a further serious loss of revenue. It is, therefore, proposed to extinguish the arrears of principal due on account of the non-guaranteed and guaranteed loans, and the capitalised interest in arrear, and also to remit the arrears of interest mentioned above, in which case it is anticipated that a half-yearly payment of 4,2502. by the Harbour Commissioners to the Loan Commissioners will be sufficient to discharge the balances of principal then outstanding within the periods originally fixed for the repay-ment of the loans, and leave a surplus for extraordinary expenditure on repairs, and other necessary works. The Eraserburgh Town Council have already agreed to extinguish the debt of 13,467?. 10.s. owing to them by the Harbour Commissioners in respect of the t amounts paid to the Loan Commissioners by the Town Council, referred to in the second paragraph above.78,128 8 (	5 13,548 . 5 (	) 1,863 8 &apos;	1 9,105 18 4	the Treasury, and added to the principal then outstanding in the accounts of the Public.-

Subsequently the Trustees found great difficulty  in  obtaining payment  of  the harbour dues and in the year 1903-4 the local herring fishing failed with the result that the revenue of the harbour was dependent on the export and import trade. This trade, however, gradually declined owing to the dangerous condition of the harbour, due to the accumu- lation of sand.   The revenue of the harbour undertaking, which suffered considerably as a result of the War, has seldom been more than sufficient to meet the expenses of management and the necessary cost of dredging each year.  Although financial assistance has  been rendered by the Fishery Board for Scotland and the Department of Agriculture for Scotland jointly towards the cost of the removal of sand from the harbour and the erection of a sand screen, it is very improbable that the revenue of the harbour will ever reach an amount sufficient to discharge the instalments of the loan and interest.  It is therefore proposed to extinguish the loan.

Although the Trustees were successful in the  litigation which followed, the Contractor went  bank- rupt, and in consequence  of the lack of  sufficient funds the Trustees have never been able to complete the works, with the result that the income of the harbour has never realised what was anticipated.  The revenue of the har- bour undertaking, which still further  suffered from the effects  of the War, is now only sufficient  to  meet the expenses of management, maintenance and repairs.  A sum of 2,512/.&apos;(ranking after  the loan of  13.000Z.) is also due to private lenders, the interest on which is consider- ably in arrear.   No improvement in the financial  position would appear to be probable  until the harbour has  been completed.   On the  other hand, it is unlikely that  a lender could be found to advance sufficient money to the Trustees to enable them to complete the harbour, except on a first mortgage.   In the circumstances it is proposed to extinguish the loan of 13,O0OZ.Oi-&apos;Qos^5oft&quot;tot-io.ass09 fit.

The last payment in respect of  the arrears was made on 14th February, 1894,  and the failure of the Trustees to make any further payments under the Board&apos;s mortgage  is due to the harbour having been abandoned in an in- complete state.  A dispute arose in the year 1894 between the Trustees and the Contractor with regard to the removal of silt from the harbour and  the Contractor removed his plant pending a settlement of his claim and subsequently obtained a Decree Arbitral against the Harbour Trust which the Trustees refused to.o8tootoI-*QO

Owing to  the  harbour being incomplete and  the  accumu- lation of silt not having  been re- moved the Board of Trade refused to  issue  their  certificate, without which no dues could be levied, and the  harbour  is  now  practically&apos; abandoned.The balance of principal outstanding was written off  the Assets of the Local  Loans Fund by the Public Works  Loans  Act,  1887,  but the Harbour  Commissioners  were  not relieved of their liability.   The.last payment in  respect of the arrears was made on  9th January,  1899, since which date the revenue of the harbour has been insufficient to meet any further payments.  Payments due under  the  Board&apos;s mortgage were made punctually until the year 1881,  when the  revenue  of  the harbour declined.   The  Harbour Commissioners attributed the decline to the improvement which had taken place in the  other harbours on the East Coast  of Scotland,  both as regards safety and  accommodation, which had the tendency  to  draw boats from Rosehearty, and also to the fact that the herring fishing was then being carried on in  a larger class of boat which required deeper, water than  is afforded  by Rose- hearty Harbour.IS3OtoI-1gpor-3

The last payment in respect of the arrears was made on 1st June, 1898, and the failure to make any further payments under the Board&apos;s mortgage is due to the falling off in the trade in coal which was the chief source of the har-bour revenue. The gross revenue of the harbour has for many years not exceeded 102. per annum, and it has conseqently been impossible to ob-tain any further payments in reduc-tion of the arrears.

The Trustees were advised that the original plan and design of the works were not sufficient to withstand the action of the sea on the face wall of the har-bour, and ultimately they had to meet heavy additional expenditure on repairs. On the outbreak of the War all fishing operations at the harbour were suspended, resulting in a further

In1924 a Provisional Order was obtainedenabling the Trustees to increase themaximum  rates by 50 per cent., but,owing to the expenditure of large sums of money on necessary repairs to the harbour road  and  the piling at  the harbour, the  net  income  has  only been sufficient to meet the arrears ofinterest  due to certain bondholdersranking in front of the Board.  Thesearrears have now been cleared off, andin order to place  the Harbour under-taking on  a more satisfactory footingit is  proposed to  remit the arrears ofinterest  due to the Board up to 31stMarch, 1930, so as to enable the Trus-tees  to resume the  making of futurepayments   due  under  the  Board&apos;smortgage.3oft-oo&amp;toI-1oOr
