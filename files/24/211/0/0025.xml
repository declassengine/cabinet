ECONOMIC  ADVISORY  COUNCIL.COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT  STATISTICS.                                  REPORT.    AT their First Meeting (E.A.C./lst Meeting, Conclusion 4 (e)), the economic advisory Council  agreed to  appoint a  Committee with  the  following  Terms  ofReference :                                                             N         &apos;&apos; To examine the published returns relating  to  the number  of persons    recorded as unemployed and to suggest methods for the regular presentation of    the figures  in  such a way as to avoid misunderstandings, whether at home or    abroad, on the extent and nature of the present unemployment problem.&quot;    2   The Committee is composed as follows:-             Sir William McLintock, G.B.E., C.V.O. (Chairman).            Mr. E. Bevin.            Sir Horace  Wilson, K.C.B., OB.E.    3.   We have  held two meetings, at which  the  returns now published were examined and  alternative methods  of presenting  the  figures were  considered.    4.   At present statistics of  unemployment in Great Britain are issued officiallyto the  Press on Tuesday of  each week.  A copy of a recent issue of  this press communique is  appended (Annex II).   Statistics, in an amplified form, are alsopublished each month in the Ministry of Labour Gazette, but since it is the statement that appears in the press each week  which obtains the greatest measure of public attention and forms the basis of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, we haveconfined our attention to  this  particular return.    5.   We are of opinion that the present form in which the numbers unemployedare published gives rise to misunderstanding principally for the reasons given in thefollowing paragraph.    6.   The Return adds together  and presents in one comprehensive total various sections of the  unemployed whose circumstances  are  quite dissimilar.    It  is truethat it proceeds to give an  analysis of this total by  separating  it into personsclassified as &quot;wholly unemployed,&quot; &quot; temporarily stopped &quot; and those normally in&quot;casual&quot; employment, but this analysis is presented as a table of figures, of whichit is feared the public would fail to  grasp the significance even if the Table werewidely published.  In fact, the Table is too large for inclusion in a single column ofthe ordinary newspaper, and the  result is that the Press, with one or two exceptions,merely presents the public, with  the gross total.  We  are of opinion that it  is verylargely this addition of dissimilar sections of the unemployed into one grand totalthat gives rise to much of the existing misunderstanding.  The persons classified as&quot;wholly unemployed&quot; in  the present returns are those  who have no  immediateknowledge  of the time or place of their next employment.  Even within this  sectionof the unemployed, there are widely differing industrial circumstances.. A very largeproportion  of  such workers  obtain further employment  within the  course&apos; of       [20886]                                                         B
a few weeks, or even of a few days, some of them. are merely passing from onejob to another,  while, at the other end of the scale, the section includes a numberof workers who have been  unemployed for very long periods and who have little prospect of being re-absorbed into industry.  The section classified as &quot;temporarily stopped,&quot; on the other hand, includes workers who,  it is known, are still attached: toan employer.  Large numbers of them are. in fact, obtaining some work with thatemployer every week, for example under systems  of  short-time working, and therest have a definite understanding that they are to return to their former employmentwithin a short period (up to. a maximum  of six weeks from the&apos; date on which theywere  suspended).  Lastly, the group  classified as being normally in casual employ-ment consists largely of  dock workers and others,  who regularly seek a livelihoodby means of jobs of  short duration,  whether  for one employer or for a number  ofdifferent employers.   In a large proportion  of these cases  also a certain amountof work is obtained  every week.  We are of opinion, therefore, that the practiceof adding together these classes with differing circumstances is open to -objection,and it has the further disadvantage that  it may tend to obscure important changesin the nature of the unemployment problem.   For example, it may happen that the trend of the figures relating to the wholly unemployed and the temporarily stoppedrespectively are in opposite directions, but if regard is had only to the totals, thesecounteracting movements cancel each other out and  an important  aspect  of theproblem of unemployment is thereby lost sight of.    7.  As already  pointed out, the unemployed persons now classified as  whollyunemployed include individuals with  widely differing experience of employment and unemployment.  We have been informed  that it is possible to sub-divide this classso as  to distinguish separately :      (i) insured persons whose record of employment has enabled them to prove the           payment  of at least 30 Unemployment Insurance contributions  in the           past two  years  (this  is  the minimum  qualification for unemployment           benefit under the normal rules);    (ii) insured persons who have paid less than 30 contributions in the preceding           two years; and    (iii) uninsured persons.    8.  Furthermore, it is  possible to furnish an analysis of claimants  for  benefitaccording to the length of time that they have been registered as unemployed.    9.  We recommend that the officially published returns of unemployment shouldmake provision for distinguishing separately these various classes of the unemployed.It is only by this means that misunderstanding, whether at home or abroad, of theextent and nature of the present unemployment problem in Great Britain will be avoided.  The Returns should also continue to give the estimated numbers of insuredpersons in wrork.    10.  We further recommend that the Returns should not only include thenumbers of unemployed persons in the  various categories referred  to  above, but should give,  in  narrative form, a statement of the principal industries in whichchanges in the numbers unemployed occurred during the previous month.    11.  We append to this Report a form of statement which we recommend shouldbe used for the publication of the unemployment returns (Annex I).    12.  Some  of the material included in the  revised form of statement canonly be furnished at monthly intervals.   We  are of opinion that the inclusionof such information  is essential if misunderstanding of the figures is to be avoided,and we, therefore, recommend that the weekly publication of  statistics of unemploy-ment should be  discontinued.   In place of the weekly return at present  issued, themore comprehensive statement now  proposed  could, we are informed, be issued on-or about the 16th of  each month in respect of a date towards the end of the previous month.   The new statement would thus be issued to the press concurrently with theinformation at  present supplied by the Ministry of Labour regarding employment,wages, cost of living, and trade disputes.     13.   We have not regarded it as  falling within our province to consider whetherthe present is an opportune time to introduce the changes, we suggest.
    14.   In the course of our Inquiry, we received from Mr. Bevin a memorandumsuggesting that the Press Communique giving the unemployment figures should also give certain other statistics or charts relating to the state of trade.  This proposalappears to go beyond our terms of reference, and Ave therefore express no opinion.upon it, but submit the memorandum herewith to the Council (Annex III).

  Suggested Form for Monthly Statement on  Employment and Unemployment.1. Insured Persons in Work.    It is estimated that on                        1930 there were approximately                   insured persons aged 16 to 64 in work in Great Britain.  This was                         than  a month before and                   l?.2 ? than a                    Jess                                             Jessyear before.2. Numbers Wholly Unemployed.    At                        1930 there were                    persons  on the registers of Employment Exchanges in Great Britain  who were out&quot; of  a situation.This was &apos;                   H?I? than a month before and                               Jess&quot;j101^  than a  vear before.   The total  on                          1930 included Jess ,                    men,                    boys,                     women and                    girls.  It was made up approximately ofinsured persons who had paid  at  least 30 contributions  during the preceding.twoyears;&apos;/                insured persons who had  paid  less  than 30 contributionsduring the preceding two years;  and                    uninsured  persons.   the claimants for benefit, numbering                   , included                   men,                    boys,                    women  and                    girlswho had  been  on the  Register  for less than  one month.    An increase in the numbers unemployed  occurred  during  the past month in thefollowing industries : On the other hand, there was some improvement in Temporarily Stopped.     At                             1930  there  were  registered  ae  unemployed                    men,                     boys,                    women  and                   girls who were  on  short  time or  were  otherwise  suspendedfrom work on the definite understanding that they were shortly to return to their former employment.     The total of                     was                      T- than a month   .        i       ,  :                                            lessbefore  and                          than a vear before.                              less         JNumbers Unemployed normally in Casual Employment.     At                      1930 there were on the register                   men,                     boys,                    women  and                    girlswho normally seek a livelihood by means of jobs of short duration (these are mainlyemployed in dock, harbour, river and canal  service).   The total ofwas                   more ^Vdn a fxionth before  and                        than                       less                                             lessa year before.
                  Present Form of Weekly Press Communique.                       EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT.    THE  Secretary of  the Ministry of Labour makes the following announcement :-    On the 10th March, 1930, the numbers of persons on the registers of EmploymentExchanges in Great  Britain were 1,084,700 wholly  unemployed, 388,500 temporarily stopped and 90,600 normally in casual employment, making a total  of 1,563,800.  Thiswas 16,583 more than a week before, and  294,961 more than a year before.  Thetotal on the 10th March, 1930, comprised  1,144,300 men, 38,700  boys, 338,700 women and 42,100 girls.Date.Persons normally in Regular      Employment.  Wholly      TemporarilyUnemployed.

                         Memorandum by  Mr. E. Bevin.     IN. considering the alteration in the form of presentation of the unemployment figures, I take the view that the mere presentation.of such figures in order to convey a particular impression will serve no useful purpose.   It has been tried so often and the figures have resulted in providing matter for  speeches, and while this has led to a good deal of ameliorative work and relief, it has not, in my opinion, contributed to what is so necessary, viz., to correlate the various factors relating to unemployment     If the figures are to be of value they must show :   &apos;     (a) The working population who have a claim to be absorbed by industry;     (6) The capacity of industry to absorb them;     (c) Whether the other factors in industry are such as will enable industry to           function in a  manner which will employ the population; &apos;    (d) If not, in what direction are we to look to distribute the supply of labour to           correspond  with  the  industrial  capacity  to  employ  the  working           population.     (NOTE. The  object  of the latter being  to  direct  the use of social service         payments  to  assist  in  the process of utilising the most  effective  and         productive life of the  workers.)     To this end the whole of our statistical information should be co-ordinated; the presentation of the figures by  the Ministry of Labour is too limited.     There are other factors acting and reacting upon unemployment  which shouldbe presented in easy and accurate form.     I prefer a chart, showing by the curves the effect of one factor  on another.     Time does not  permit me to produce  such a chart  at  this meeting, but  the following will  indicate what is in  my mind and  no doubt  the staff could do  thepreparatory work :          (1) To  show the monthly bank balances and credit available.         (2) The price levels.         (3) Production.         (4) Persons employed.         (5) Persons unemployed.         (6) Wage levels.         (7) Total available working population.     The above factors, in my opinion, are correlated, and I would say,  in  connectionwith                                                       /(1)  Bank Balances and Credit.    The production of these figures by the  Treasury and  the Bank of  England  foruse in  relation to the other factors would cause a consideration to enter into policy,which, in the past, has been almost entirely absent.                  &apos;(2)  Price  Levels.    The effect  of the price  levels is practically unknown by both Trade. Unionnegotiators and  the ordinary managements they are hit and they fight blindly overwages.  A study of  this problem will, I feel, constitute a new approach, especially from the point of view of progressive efficiency, and will assist the Treasury in itstaxation policy in so far as it enters into the cost of production.(3)  Production.    The Board  of Trade has  control of the Census of Production, but so far as i know,  this has  never been utilised for the purpose of assisting Industry, either to adjust hours or wages, or to  know  the values  in a manner likely to assist in there organisation of industry or in the promotion of its efficiency.
 24?14*(4) Persons Employed.    This is an extremely important point.  There are no means available whereby the speed of  absorption of the population  into Industry can be proved.  This isimportant, too, in view of rationalisation, &amp;c, and by publishing the employed figures as well as    . (5) the unemployed figures, the real position can be ascertained.(8)  Wage Levels.    The  money wage  levels will give us information as to the purchasing power ofthe masses in relation to production;  and the progress of the wage levels in relationto increased production and efficiency.    In conclusion, I would emphasise that  the presentation of statistical inf information-tion will  cause a co-ordinated study of the problem itself; it will help us to  get outof the watertight departmental manner of handling the problem; and what I regard as vital,  it would cause the Treasury to have regard, in the consideration of everyfinancial  movement, to its  effect upon the problem of employment, while the Boardof Trade would be linked up with the financial and employment  problems in a more precise manner.  In addition, the Ministry of Health and other Departments wouldbe enabled to make a  reasonable forecast of the appropriate periods for home andpublic utility development.    At the same time, Great Britain would be presented, not as down and out, but rather in the light of its achievements.    The  Committee will pardon the rough outline of this Memorandum^ but  I have          - -  -     -     1          n    T.1      * ,   1*1   I    11*&apos;-&apos;ERNEST BEVIN.o
