.1 i*66.JTjjb-Document f$ the Property ofHULL.....&quot;........ll^Jestya QovernmenT r\War Cabinets Pensions of Officers1 Widows.IMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Wart15iThe decisions of the War Cabinet on 17th September (W.C.473 (il)) and Hr. Hodge&apos;s Memorandum G.Tt5G76 prepared in accordance therewith, call for certain further observations.1.     I agree that the decision to raise the &quot;highest rate&quot; pensions of widows of subaltern officers killed in former wars from  80 to  100 will lead to a demand for increase of the &quot;intermediate , rate&quot; pensions of  60 and that these should be raised to  75 as proposed in paragraph 13 of lir. Kodge!s paper.But it should be made clear that this applies only to cases arising out of former wars *   a certain number of these pensions have been given in cases&quot;of death from injury in the performance of duty in peace time; but the whole application of the new pension codes for both officers and men is at present limited to war cases.2,     The decision to increase the pensions of the widows of General Officers whose death was due to War Service in former wars, where the newratesfor such widows are higher than the old, wouldinvolve derious difficulty in principle.   It would be a marked departure from the principle that only the smallest pensions arising from former wars should be increased.   As regards intermediate pensions, assuming the proposal at (l) above to be approved, it would leave us with an increase at both ends of the scale of rank (Subalterns and General. Officers) but with the middle rank3 (Captains kajors and Colonels) untouched;   while to announce a general increase of such pensions for all ranks in the case of any class, even officers&apos; widows, would lead to similar claims from other classes.It so happens that there are in fast no pensions which would be increased under this decision if it were announced, and I therefore suggest that the decision to revise the pensions of General Officers&apos; widows arising from former wars might well be cancelled.3.     I agree with Mr* Hod^c (paragraph lu of his Memorandum) that a demand may possibly arise for revision of the retired pay of certain ulasses of officers disabled in former wars,   Dut I suggest that this question (which will require very careful study) should be left for consideration if and when the demand arises.   The demand for increase of pensions of all kinds will doubtless continue, but in dealing only with widows&apos; pensions we are observing a perfectly defensible distinction.4.observed a.I1 or tne that :.-sake of correctness of record, it should beb.The increase of children&apos;s allowances mentioned at paragraph 10 of Kr. hodge&apos;s memorandum was made by the Seleot Committee of 1914/lb, and;That Committee recommended as one of the principal features of its scheme a system of discretionary grants,supplementing those to be administered by the purpose; while the newMinistry covers the supplementary as well a grants.be made under the Pay Warrant, to Statutory Committea set up for that Royal Warrant of the pensionthe fixed-rate21st October, 1918.
