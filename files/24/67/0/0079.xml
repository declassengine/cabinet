j^S&quot;CAB/S JLyiil2 H!T!^ is thr property of     , . .&quot;7ii&apos;n&apos;&quot;j *,,v *i4jsstys Governmentreport no, 24v^.............----------gist october, 1918,*&apos;FORTNIGHTLY REPORT ON PACIFISM AND REVOLUTIONARY ORGANISATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND MORALE IN FRANCE AND ITALY.(Circulated by the Home Secretary)my 0orrespondents all over the country report.the morale of working men to be now probably at.its highest point.    in liverpool,&quot;conversation in the workshops is all on winning the war.    &quot;\7e mubt give the germans b..... socks now we have got them on the run&quot;.   even shop stewards have been heard to talk like this, but what is most interesting is that many who were formerly advocates of a round table con-ferenoe, are now not only determined to beat the germans, but also to make them pay the cost of the war, &quot;even if it takes a thousand   years to do it&quot;.   they say. &quot;if the government does not make germany pay for the war, we (the workers) will have to find the money, and we don&apos;t see why we should.    the germans made the french pay in 1870, and they must pay now&quot;,    those who were formerly inclined to find exouses for the germans are now justifying a demand for indemnities 1-    &quot;after all, this war has been fought more for the democracy of germany than for anyone else.    it will result in their emancipation!   instead of being ruled by the military class.they will rule themselvesin other words, &quot;as we are going to bestow benefitsupon the germans, they pught to pay the market value for them&quot;.my liverpool correspondent says that the ohange of tone in the workshops is really remarkable.    the recent submarine outrages have made people very bitter, and all except the .extremists take the view that the peace proposals are simply a dodge to gain time for concentrating the german array.    there is-a remarkable widening of outlook,among the lancashire workers.    some of them are&apos;discussing the object of the germans in wrecking the country they are evacuating, and the general opinion is to the effect that in flooding the french mines^, stealing machinery, smashing workshops and plant, etc, the germans are seeking to put france back for years in the&apos; economic competition which will follow the war.a woman who is in close touch with the directors of the women&apos;a peace crusade&apos; says that they have come to the conclusion that house to house visiting in the cause; of peace is useless, for the visitors are often subjected to abuse, and the doors are shut in their&apos;faces.    they are, in fact, very despondent.at an independent labour party meeting early last week, only thirty-five persons attended.mr .j&apos;.h.white house, m.p. for mid-lanark, addressed a meeting for the independ-ent labour party in newcastle, on the 3rd, and made a pacifist speech of the usual type.    he said that the only sane way to obtain peace was by negotiation, and that the peaoe conference should be conducted by persons specially elected by the democracies, and not by civil servants or diplomats.    about eighty persons attended.john hill, the general seoretary of the boilermakers&apos; society, has brought.a storm about his head by framing a peace resolution to be adopted by his exeoutive committee.    this. resolution he sent to the press.    three days after publication a resolution was, passed by the boilermakers, employed in messrs. palmers&apos; shipyard,-jarrow,. protesting against his action, and demanding that the government accept nothing short of unconditional surrender with indemnities and the punishment of
the authors of all orimoe oommitted against International Law.    It wao also resolved that John Hill should be asked to resign his position,    Sinilar meetings were held in other yards.The situation in the Midlands is much the same.    The Independent Labour Party seems to be confining -its efforts to the sale of literature and tho , oolleotion of money for the support of Parliamentary candidates.    Councillor Raynes, of Derby, a strong Pacifist, has withdrawn his nomination from the Mayoralty, recognizing that his views would result in considerable disunion in the Council Chamber if he were elected,,  The other side of the picture comes from a working man correspondent on the Clyde, who nays that there is already a talk of opposing the League of Nations, on the ground that, while pretending to foster a better feeling between nations, it will really be a &quot;world capitalist oombine&quot; to shackle the working classes. The agitators are pointing to the Employers Federation as an instanoe of organisations for restricting the liberties of the working olass, and they say, &quot;What will it be like when the Federation becomes international?    Tho world will then be entirely ruled by oppression,&quot;    Unfortunately, foolish talk like this is swallowed whole by the more ignorant.    The same man goes on to say that though industrial affairs on the Clyde are fairly quiet at present, it would take very little to cause a big upheaval.    The women, he says, are annoyed about the prices of food, and although Mr, Clynes received a gcod hearing in Glasgow, his audienoe was of the middle class, who oan leave their families in charge of servants when they are out.    If it had been composed of old age pensioners, soldiers&apos; wives, miners, railwayman and War widows, he would have had a very different reception.    He says that allowanoe is not made for the bad conditions under which the workers live.    Many of the men go to work in the morning on dry bread, &quot;This&quot;, he says &quot;does not tend to make men run about the streets with Union Jaoks in their hands, shouting for oarrying on the War&quot;, He sums up the position by Baying that it is eenly the lack of leadership, the Defence of the Realm Regulations,, and Conscription which are saving the country from Revolution, and even this^ is now smouldering,The same writer says that there is a determined attempt among the extremists to oapture the Disoharged Soldiers1 Federation, and the demand for better allowanoes should be very oarefully watched, for if they auooeed in getting the soldiers and their wives to baok thorn, they will be a very numerous and dangerous body.An unconfirmed report from Birmingham states that Mrs. Fawoett, of the Birmingham National Federation of Women Workers, is advising women against buying War Bonds,    Further enquiry will be made into thi6.THE AMALGAMATED SOCIETY OF ENGINEERS AND THE RAILWAYMKN,A well informed correspondent thinks that the Shop Steward movement among the engineers will entirely upset orthodox Trade Unionism,    He describes the workers as being sick of Parliament and officialism, and as soon as the restraining influence of the War is removed, he thinks that there will be a revolt everywhere,    Tho same tendency is to be seen amoftr the railwayman, who are reported to be firming Station Committees, similar to the Workers&apos; Committees
in the engineering industry,    Tho names of the principal railway agitators are J. Beale, P.II. Blaok, and &apos;v&apos;,T.A. Foot. who is Parliamentary candidate for Bedford.Nevertheless, the Executive of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.is quite sound about the War. and when lir, W.O. Anderson approached some of them, asking them to assist certain Pacifists in propaganda work; he was told that they would not appear on the same platform with any man who did not want the War fought to a finish.ELECTRICAL TRADES UNION. &apos;.The position of this Union as a revolutionary Body has been the oau.Be of much anxiety for a considerable time.    It is oomposed of a minority of skilled Eleotrioal Engineers, with a smattering of education, and an overweening sense of their cwn value and importancei and a large b*dy of unskilled men, such as stokers, who have been persuaded to join the Union for the purpose of united action.    The leaders, Stavenhagen and Webb, are openly revolutionary.    The polioy of the Union has been to slow down work required for the Royal Air Foroe and to prepare for paralysing the country by a sudden stoppage of all the Power Stations.    With this ebjeot in view they have been using pressure to get all the nen in the Power Stations to join; but, so far, they have been unsuooessful with the clerks and with the higher grade electricians, who have formed a society of their own called &quot;The Eleotrioal Power Engineers&apos; Association&quot;.    Matters are now coming to a head, for on the 24th instant their demand will be refused, and it is probable that they will at onoe come cut on strike.    If this wero allowed the stoppage of power in the Underground, Tubes and Trams, Anti-aircraft Search Lights, operations in hospitals, oold storage and the printing of newspapers would immpdiatsly result.    The Union is net very large, and it is very unpopular with other Unions, so there oan be no better time for resisting a strike than the present.      Steps are being taken quietly to provide an alternative service. An entire stoppage, which would result in the loss of thousands of tons of frozen meat, etc. is unlikely to take plaoe.    It is also unlikely that an attempt to bring abcut a Btrike will result in other Unions owning out.MR. E.3. MOREL.The candidature of Mr. E.D. llorel for Motherwell is very much resented,and no -one seems to know who is responsible for having brcught his name forward. The responsible Trade Unionists, who were approached by some of the Glasgow Pacifists en M*rel&apos;s behalf, indignantly declined to support him.SHOP STEWARDS.A Conference of Shop Stewards was held at Chandos Hall oh the 4th October, when it was decided to form a London Council for Shop -Stewards and Workers&apos; Committees,    Some of the extreme members, such as Tanner, Di?kie, and Chapman opposed the proposal, on the ground that better work could be done by having a l*cse organisation and decentralisation,    A further Conference is to be held on the 26th.A REVOLUTIONARY MEETING.W.F. Watson addressed a meeting held at Chandos Hall on the fith, and stated that the London Workers 1 Committee would support all future strikes.    The audience
consisted largely of railwayman, tube &apos;bus and tram, workers.    A delegate from the. tubes ,abated that the railway tube and &apos;bus services have.&apos;, now joined forces, and that the workers were in a position to paralyse London at a moment&apos;s notloo, and looked to Mr. Watson for support,    Watson made the usual kind of revolutionary speech, saying&apos;that London must become the Petrograd of England, and the workers must unite and adopt the Russian principle of Freedom.    He added that &quot;our comrades in &quot;Russia&quot;heed not fight the Allies, as the coming winter would do it for them,&quot;    Watson does not neglect his own interests4 There is a movements which has his oordial support, to raise a fund in the form of a testimonial to him, for clearing off a debt of over  70 left by the late Amalgamation Committee.    It is hoped to raise the money by the 9th November, when a dinner will be given at the Bell Inn, Holborn, with MoIIanus in the Chair. The person who is engineering this testimonial is David Ramsey, of 72* Lowfield, Street, Dartford, who is believed to be a dangerous agitator of whom more will be heard.PROSECUTIONS.A prosecution is pending against Tom Liann for speeches he has made in South tfales, where he has lately been advocating Bolshevism, in addition to his usual cry for six hours a day, five days a week,  1 a day. and a holiday on full pay.^ean van Roendoenck, a Belgian tool-setter at the Daimler Works, Coventry, has been sont to prison for six months with hard labour and deportation for circulating a Bolshevik pamphlet entitled &quot;To the Toiling Masses&quot; amongst his work mates.     This pamphlet is being widely cir**dlated by the Independent Labour Party in Barrow and London, and. it is probable that there will be further proseoutions, , .John Barraclough, Secretary of the&apos; South Dorset Labour Party, was charged at Weymouth for having said &quot;The issue of War Loans and War Bonds is a swindle.&quot; The oase was dismissed for lack of avidence.Miss Sylvia Pankhurst is to be prosecuted for a speech she made at Creswell, in Derby,     ^he oase is to be heard on the 28th,BOLSHEVISM IN ENGLAND.Jhe Ministry of Information and the War Aims Committee are now oiroulating information on the true state of,Russia under the Bolshevik regime.    It is to be hoped that when they are giving details about the Terror they will not lay too much stress on the outrages committed on the bourgeoisie, a matter about which the English extremists will feel unsympathetio, but will give ample details, especially in the Sunday ne\7spapers, of what working men have to suffer.1 -    *The term &quot;Bolshevik&quot;, as used by tho Daily Press, is very difficult to define.    Beside tho doctrinaire&quot; socialists, who profess Bolshevik sympathies, the term is made to inolude every kind of revolutionary agitator; whether he is a paolfist and conscientious objector, or anarchist and Industrial v/orker of tho World,    The English friends of Russian revolutionaries, such as ldtvinoff, are neither, a large nop influential&quot;class, and of course, they have had no real
^   t)M         Mexperienoo of what Bolshevism; moans.    An exact translation of the word &quot;Bolshevik&quot; is, 1 am told, &quot;out-and-outer&quot;, but people who live under the Bolshevik regime describe it as a sort of infectious disease, spreading rapidly, but insidiously, until like a cancer it oats away the fabric of society, an:l the patient ceases even to wish for his own reoovery.    A nation attacked by it may, if we may judge from the state of Russia, be reduced to a political and social morass, which may last perhaps for a generation or more, with no hope of renotion; whilst civilisation crumbles away and the country returns to its original barbarism.    If this progress of disintegration has seized on Germany the Allies may find themselves with no-one in the enemy countries to negotiate with.     It is difficult to believe that it would ever attack nations with the genius,for practical organisation such as England and Germany, for even our extreme revolutionaries show a constructive instinct, but, in conjunction with syndicalism it may make some headway, and it would not take very much in the midst of serious labour disturbances, carried on with the sympathy of the Police, to do enormous damage to the oredit of the country.     Unfortunately, syndicalist agitators seem to think that tho Capitalist has all his oapital in the form of gold&apos;in a box, and that all they have to do is to possess themselves of the box to carry on Industry as proprietors rather than servants.     They oannot under-  * stands that Capital and Credit are plants too sensitive to withstand sudden storms and upheavals,i&apos;The Bolsheviks are.-now secretly circulating tr;o pamphlets, one &quot;To the Toiling Masses&apos;1 signed by Lenin and Trotsky, printed without imprimatur, and the other, &quot;Lesscnc on the Russian Revolution&apos;1,&apos; signed by Lenin, which has been printed for the British Socialist Party.    As I reported a fortnight ago, Fairchild, of the British Socialist Party, is believed to have reoeived a considerable sum of money from Litviucff before he left, and tho money is probably being spent in this way.    A large number of copies of the second pamphlet have been seized at the offioe of the British Socialist Party, but in the present state of the Law it does not seem possible to found a-prosecution upon it,WOMEN WORKERS AMD SHOP STEWARDS,A mass meeting of women workers in Aircraft factories is to be convened for the 23rd October, for the purpose of organising the Shop Steward movement among women,    W.F, Watson, a declared Bolshevik, is to be one of the speakers.FRANCE AND BELGIUM.During the past fortnight, the military and civilian morale in France and Belgium has remained very high.     Among the Frenoh soldiers the certainty of d victory has strengthened the demand for reparation, which is now plainly tinged with a longing for revenge.     The tendency to belittle the part played by British troops is disappearing, in the light of the recent offensive in the Cambrai - Le Cateau sector, and the victories in Palestine and Maosdonia, and also the rumour that an awkward situation oread ed between Cambrai and St. Quentin by the Impetuosity of the Americans, was relieve^ by tho arrival of British and Australian Divisions. It is to be noted also that the French now speak warmly of the Belgian,Army. This has reacted favourably upon the Belgians, who are now said to show their
-* 0 -increased selfrespect by the way they walk down the street.    The men make light of minor wounds, and a percentage of them leave the hospital at their own request n-before they are quite fit, in order net to miss the fighting.     It iB reported that the,King of the Belgians went over the top at the beginning of the attack, and could be held back only with difficulty.    His A.D.0, was killed beside him. It is perhaps not to&apos;be wondered at that tho Belgians have shown ferocity in the moment of victory.    A wounded German Officer said that they fought like dogs, massacring the wounded and prisoners,The Portuguese are net covering themselves with glery.    In Aubigny they have been quarreling  with the British and using their knives.    They appear especially te dislike the Canadians, with   whom they have had fcur or five affrays, in which they brought their knives into play.The rooralo of French civilians is also at a yery high level, though they have great ground   for oomplaint about the high food prices and profiteering. There is much criticism of the mismanagement of the food question by the Authorities, who appear to allow controlled commodities to: be sold at far more than the Controllod price.Though Pacifist agitators obtain a ready hearing when they approach their )&apos; audiences on the subjeot of the cost of living, the rank and file of Labour are showing a very good spirit as regards the War,    For example, during the strike of the dockers at Dunkirk they were always ready to unload British munitions and British coal, and the railwaymeh of the Nord Railway, while agitating for an additional War bonus, have deoided not to strike, even if their demands are refused.       &apos;.Meanwhile, the dispute betwoen the employers and metal workers at Havre remains unsettled, and Legratn is pressing to have the dispute submitted to tho Ministry of Armament for arbitration.    This course has been adopted.    It is Significant that though, as compared with the wages paid&apos;to munition workers in this oountry, the demands of the workers are very moderate, and though some bitterness,might have been expected at the persistent refusal of the masters to meet them, they passed a Resolution, quite temperately worded, pointing out that they had always done their duty and had endeavoured to produce the maximum amount of work.    In faot, their morale as regards the Y/ar is unexceptionable.The strikes in; the-clothing trade in Paris; where the employees of largo dressmaking establishments are holding out&apos; for an eight hour day, have not yet come to an end&apos;, though a resumption of work is expected next week.    In none of these Labour disputes ,1b there any trace of Pacifism.- - The only cloud on the horizon for the moment is the &quot;behaviour of the Socialists under the guidance of Jean Longuet, the grandson- of Karl Marx, who had a sweeping.majority at the Meeting held last Sunday week by the Socialists of the- Seine.    This nan and his followers are fomenting distrust of the intentions of this oountry with regard to the German Colonies, and against British Imperialism as a whole.    Active preparation is being made for the
National Socialist Congress to be held this month, and it is feared that the Longuet Party my beoome the direotors of the Party organ &quot;L^iumanite&quot;.   Longuet, as I havo already reported, returned from London in a very bad temper with the English.    Taking from the Germans the threadbare argument that Ireland, Egypt, and India are oppressed nationalities, striding for liberty, Longuet is warning his oountrynen against the ambitions of England and Italy, and is pointing to the seizure of the Gorman Colonies as a proof that the War has degenerated into a War of oinquest.-    This would not matter very muoh if the talk was limited to Sooialiat ciroles, but unfortunately it appears to be taken up by people who will have nothing to dc with Socialism, and it may grow to be a real danger.    She French aro very ignorant regarding British colonisation to-day.    They imagine it to be a s(.rt of paternal despotism in which no kind of individual liberty is allowed.    nL1Humanite&quot; is warning its readers against Imperialism and national egoism as the natural result of cur conquests in the East.    As long as; the Allies were btund together by a common danger, there was little room for International jealousy, but nw that this danger is passing, we shall have to watch French susceptibilities very closely.    There is a great need for explaining to the Frenoh hew the question of returning the German Colonies in Afrioa and the Paoifio is regarded in England, and what the British proposals are regarding Syria, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.    No doubt this need has been taken note of by the Ministry of Information, who arc row seriously taking up the question of propaganda in France.     It has been pointed out that the suspension for a few days or the confiscation of single issues of Ssoialist Newspapers, such as &quot;La Populaire&quot;,&quot;L&apos;Heure&quot;, and &quot;La Vague&quot; only irritate Socialist opinions the orders often como too late to be of use.The subscription lists for the next French War Loan aro to open on the 20th, but already it is reported from Lyons that premises of subscriptions are coming, in,ITALY.Thers appears to have Been a good deal of anti-war agitation in Italy during the past two or three weeks.    The Mayor of Sirmione was arrested by the Carabiniori of Brescia, for having made anti-war statements.    The Army area is beset by rumours suoh as that when General Piaz visitod France, Marshal Foch refused to send any help to Italy, and this was why the offensive was delayed; that the Premier was visiting Paris to protest against Italy&apos;s interests being sacrificed to those of France; that the Italian offensive was postponed owing to the Austrian Peaoo novo.Information received from Berne shows that French and ItAlian anaraohists are in oonstant correspondence with their comrades in Italy.The Government has confiscated a postcard reproducing the first page of the Republican journal, &quot;il Luoifero&apos;1, of Ancona, praising the tired days&quot; of 1914. In the middle of the postcard is a photograph of the agitator, Pietro Nenni, who was killed in a conflict with the PoliceaA report has been received fr-*m Switzerland to the effect that the Jew agent, HaiphandV who made himself notorious in Copenhagen, is actively engaged in Switzerland in oarrying cn Republican propaganda among the Italian deserters there,
advocating tho overthrow of the Italian Dynasty, and the establishment of a Republio aB the means by which Italians oan live in pea^o in their own oountry There has fcoen an agitation among th^metal workers f.*r obtaining permission for their members, serving in the Army, to attend meetings,.    In the Turin area the General has permitted this, provided that the meetings do not trenohupon politics, ,By order of the Pope, 130,000 parcels have been sent to the Nuncio in Bavaria for distribution among Italian prisoners of War in Germany.    This is the first indication f the number of Italian prisoners actually held by the Enemy.As Boon as the German demand for an armistioe was&apos;announced in Florenoe the people appeared to go mad.    They paraded the streets for many hours, singing songs and &quot;Mafficking&quot;.    The whole demonstration was so artificial that it seems certain that It was carefully organised in advance by the Socialists,B.H.T.SB 39-46.
