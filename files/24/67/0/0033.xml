JFeefc ended 12^ Gcto&amp;er, 1918.NAVAL OPERATIONS.Minelaying has been carried out in the North Sea.North Sea.R.A.F. machines from Dunkirk, working with the Navy, during the week carried Flanders out a raid on Westende and Middelkerke, and also raids on enemy road and railway Area&apos; communications, the total weight of bombs dropped being about 14 tons.   During aerial fighting six enemy machines were destroyed and two driven down out of control, and two of our machines are missing.   Flying was hampered by bad weather conditions.On 10th October s.s. &quot; Leinster &quot; was torpedoed and sunk 2 miles S.E. of Kish Light Irish Sea. Vessel (E. of Dublin Bay).   The vessel carried troops, of whom about 330 were lost.On 6th October the armed merchant cruiser &quot; Otranto &quot; was wrecked on the Island Casualties, of Islay after collision with the s.s. &quot; Kashmir.&quot;  Both vessels were carrying United States troops.   335 troops and 96 of the crew were lost from &quot; Otranto,&quot; but &quot; Kashmir &quot; reached       , port and landed her troops without any casualties.On 6th October H.M. drifter &quot; Ocean Foam &quot; was sunk in collision with a trawler in Penzance Bay, the crew being saved.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review from 16 to 21 large enemy submarines, of a type which Submarines operates further afield than the North Sea, were located, included in this number being four opwating. of the &quot; cruiser &quot; type, of which one was to the westward of Ireland, homeward bound, two were operating off the North American coast, and one in the vicinity of the Azores. The remaining large boats were mainly operating in the Irish Sea, to the westward of the North Channel and in the Bay of Biscay. The Irish Sea was the chief area of activity, while the East Coast was again markedly quiet and the English Channel entirely immune.The following Table shows the number of actions between Allied craft and enemy Actions submarines which are reported to have taken place in all waters during recent weeks      enemy and the nature of the craft which have been engaged ; and also the number of submarines submarines. which have been destroyed or lost to the enemy as the result of such actions : 	Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Week ended		Sept. 21st.

In non-United Kingdom Trades, however, the September losses, both as regards number and tonnage, are exactly half those which were sustained in, August.Vessels The number of British and Foreign merchant vessels sailing in organised Convoyconvoyed,   ^hjch completed their voyages during last week, and the losses sustained whilst in such Convoys, compared with corresponding figures for previous periods, are as follows : Losses of British and Foreign steamships in trades.

Attacks in September on vessels engaged in U.K. over-seas trades.During the week ended 5th October the losses in the Mediterranean were one in the Milo-Bizerta Convoy, two in the Bizerta-Marseilles Convoy, and two in the Salonika-Milo Convoy.The total number of steamships of over 500 tons of all nationalities which sailed to and from the United Kingdom in Overseas trade in the month of September was 2,028, and of these 1,865 or,92 per cent, sailed in Convoy and 163 independently of Convoy; 9 attacks were made on the 163 non-convoyed vessels, resulting in the loss of 2, whilst of the 1,865 convoyed vessels 11 were attacked and 7 sunk whilst in Convoy, and 21 attacked and 14 sunk before joining or after dispersal. Of the convoyed sailings 0-37 per cent, were lost in Convoy and 0*75 before joining or after dispersal, while 1 -23 per cent, of the non-convoyed vessels sailing were sunk.The numbers of British and Foreign steamships of 500 tons and upwards which were Number of attached by submarine in the different areas in the months of June, July.

Despite the reduction in total attacks, however, there is a further increase in the number of attacks in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel.The numbers of British and Foreign steamships of 500 tons and upwards which were Number of sunk in the different areas in the months of June, July, August and September are shown vessels sunk in the following Table:- 1 b?sub&quot;	Number of Ships Sunk.

There is a decrease of 15 losses on the August figures, mainly due to reduced activity ofi the American Coast.Tonnage sunk by submarine in recent months compared.The following Table shows the amount of tonnage sunk in the different areas during the last four months, from which it will be seen that, though in September the tonnage lost in Home Waters equalled the average for the preceding three months, there is a decided reduction in each of the other areas : Area.

The general inactivity as regards enemy minelaying in Home Waters was maintained during the week under review, but a further group of mines has been located in the Thraso Straits (iEgean, in the neighbourhood of Kavala), which was doubtless aimed at the movements now taking place in that locality owing to the Balkan situation.Of the mines destroyed abroad, eight were located in the Thraso Straits and two off Mudros.Casualties.

No enemy ships have entered or left Rotterdam.
FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.France.Two armoured cruisers have been ordered to Mudros to complete the Allied iEgean Squadron.On 7th October at 6 a.m. the French Syrian Coast Division entered the harbour of Beyrout.On 10th October the battleship &quot; Voltaire&quot; was torpedoed 20 miles east of Matapan.  She reached Milo in a damaged condition at 4.15 the next morning.Spain.At the first Council held by the new Ministry it was at last decided definitely to take 15,500 tons of German shipping, the equivalent of the five Spanish steamships sunk since the Governments Note of 14th August. Meanwhile it is understood that Germany has ofiered to charter to Spain five steamers whose tonnage aggregates 16,966 tons. Five more vessels have been placed at the German Ambassadors disposal, to replace any . further vessels sunk outside the blockaded area. In all, seven Spanish steamers have, in fact, been sunk since August 14th.Russia.The German Expeditionary Force to Finland has been almost entirely withdrawn. On 8th October there remained only a total of about 5,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, with one battery of artillery.The Archangel Government has at last been formed with M. Chaikovski as President, and is considered satisfactory from an Allied point of view*It is reported from Stockholm that mine-sweeping is to commence at once round Eckero (Aland Islands), so that the cable which carries the direct traffic between England and Russia, and which has for some months been in German hands, may be taken up and repaired.Naval Staff.nth October, 1918.[Appendices.
