Offing to the unfavourable weather conditions prevailing during the iast week, comparatively few new aerodromes have boon located. On the 14th instant 16 new aerodromes were located in the area between Hons and Mauberge and 6 more in the vicinity to the S, of the latter place.
GENERALBad weather has hampered our aerial observation so that it has been impossible to obtain any evidence as to changes in location of the enemy&apos;s aerial forces and their changes in policy and numerical strength,,   Large forces of scout machines for day &apos;ork have been concentrated opposite the Northern Battle front. There has been an increase in day bombing on forward areas when the weather has permitted it and also in the use of machines for firing on roads and other ground targets with machine guns. This policy has, ho..ever., been confined to the Northern battle front,(&amp;)   Pistributiou of t German Bombing Forcesjdthe &quot;western Front.(Twin engine and Giant machines).The distribution of the Bombing Squadrons on the western Front remains the same, although it.is not known where the different flights are now actually situated.Reliable information has been received that a new Bombing Squadron has arrived on the Verdun Front.   The formation of this new squadron has been in progress for some months at PADSRB0R1I, and its arrival at the Front has been suspected for some time past.(e) Losses in German Air Forces - western Front.Aeroplanes 0[The total losses sustained by the enemy on the Western front, due to British activities from the beginning of January, ltlS to October 20th, 1S;18, are as follows:-Western Front(R.A,F% ,with the Armies in the PieIda)2529 machines; destroyed. 1029 out of control,Total. 3558 machines.5th Group (RtA..Fo with the Navy ^Dover &amp; Dunkirk.)109 machines destroyed.

During the remainder of the week the weather was unfavourable for flying and few machines were seen. Low flying and reconnaissanco has not been above normal consider-ing the operations in progress,   Scout machines have engaged ground targets with machine gun fire.   Bombing has been confined to forward areas.ROUBAIX Canal to the SCARES.During the 14th, which was the only fine day, activity was slight.

There has boon very little flying on either side during the past week owing to v/eather conditions which have been consistently bad.   During such periods as have been possible for flying the enemy has not shown any unusual activity.   His abnormal activity of the previous week is new thought definitely to have been caused by nan attempt to mislead us as to the continued presenceon tho front of companies which hauo been removed,ENEMY AERODROMES.     No further change has taken place,(b) PALESTINE, SALONIKA, MSSOPMAJfl A and RUSSIA,No change,3*   AIRSHIPSe   During the last fortnight very little activity has been displayed, probably due to the unfavourable weather conditions.GERMANY, SEAPLANES,     Practically no activity has been displayed but&quot;&quot;this is due in all probability to the removal of all Seaplanes from their bases on the Belgian coast,COINING OUT IN THK GERMAN AIR SERVICE.A prisoner states that, in July last, there were some 00,000 men at the recruit depot at Bevorloo, who had been combed out from the Air Service and a few other units *   These men were posted to units in the field, after 6 weeks&apos; training,SHORTAGE 01? OFFICER PILOTS IN THE AUSTRO HUNGARIAN AIR FORCE,In order to meet the necessity for Officer Pilots which is daily becoming more urgent,, the War Minister has issued orders    thereby officers Of every corps, arm and unit, regardless of present duties, are to be invited to attend a course of instruction for pilots.   Application must be accompanied by a recommendation from their commanders and submitted through military headquarters.   No application may be refused, but all must be transmitted to the War Minister.MISCELLANEOUS,Supply of German Fighting LsachinOBn   - The following is derived from a German document, recently captured,&quot;During last r/inter we devoted all our efforts &quot;toward the creation of new Pursuit Squadrons and supplying &quot;Battle Squadrons with new aeroplanes &amp; Halberstadt and &quot;Hannover.   But, since the end of February, our material &quot;for Pursuit   Machines has been found insufficient, the Albatros &quot;D III and D,V. v&amp;re considered antiquated, and the ne;v &quot;Pfalz D.III machines and Fokker triplanes were not satisfactory, &quot;As a result of conferences and tests at Adlershof (near Berlin)
&quot;a now aeroplane, tho Fokker D.VII. r/as found superior to the &quot;aeroplanes already knuvn and its manufacture v.as begun t &quot;ir:,mediately,&quot;The slackening of manufacture due to the change in &quot;c nstruction, the transformation of the existing material, &quot;and the replacement of the heavy losses suffered by our &quot;aviation from the first days of the March offensive, created a &quot;crisis in aviation.   The strength of the Pursuit Flights &quot;rapidly decreased, and the replacement of worn out material &quot;v/as siov/.&quot;At tho present time,the increased production from &quot;the v/ar factories would permit of the replacement of destroyed &quot;machines or worn parts in a very short space of time.   In &quot;spite of the great losses resulting from our offensive and &quot;that of the Allies, the threatened crisis in aviation material &quot;is averted,&quot;&quot;The follov/ing from an order issued by General von Below,   &apos; dated 22.0.1010:- points to the fact that fighting concentration to prevent reconnaissance, necessitates reliance upon ground defences against low flying aeroplanes.&quot;The best means of defence against enemy airmen are cur &quot;scouts, which are being steadily reinforced.   Their numbers &quot;will, however, never equal the en-flmy1^ strength in fighting &quot;machines.   It is only by concentrating strong scout foroes &quot;on certain parts of the front that the enemy^s reconnaissance &quot;and fighting activity can be curtailed.   As a result, troops in quiet sectors will frequently have the impression that they &quot;are not being protected; they must rely upon defence from &quot;the ground against their most dangerous air opponent, the &quot;loi/-flying machines.&quot;NIGHT RSC0MAI35AHCS.A captured document, emanating from the C.G.3. of the Held Army, dated the 3rd September,1918,, shows that the enemy attaches considerable importance to air reconnaissance by night.   The follov/ing is the translation of some extracts f-^om this document; -The object of night reconnaissances is to provide information to the Higher Command, regarding the trend and extent -   usually considerable when operations are impending of any movement behind the enemy&apos;s lines under cover of darkness. During operations, the battlefield should be patrolled by night reconnaissance machines.Useful and relaible reports can only be expected from observers, who, having worked over an area for a long time, kiiov/ the country well. ..If it is not possible to reconnoitre railway lines, roads and water courses for movement by repeatedly flying along their whole length, one reconnaissance should be carried out between midnight and 3 a.m., as the beginning or end of any important movement will take place during that period.   The direction of railway movement and the activity at stations can be recognised by the glare frwia locomotives and the vhite smoke issuing from them.   Size and nature of train movements and of entraining or detraining operations can only be observed by machines flying at a low altitude,   Increased activity at stations can be recognised by the unavoidable increase in lights on sidings and platforms.Night -reconnaissance machines v/ill be sent out singly in order not to attract the enemy1s attention, which would cause tola to $actiii^u&amp;sft lights and alarm his defences.-  It is recommended  hat machines should cross the lines at great heights, and then glide down   it may also be advisable to fly v/ith the
engine throttled down.   Machine guna should only bo used for self-defence or when there is a chance of causing serious losses to. tho e$pmy-   A machine wh:i ch limits itself to reconnoitring may sometimes be taken by the enemy for one of his ovm aeroplanes,The best type of machine., as low flying is necessary, is a tv/o-oeator.   Twin-engine machines, although permitting a heavier load Of bombs to be carried, have the disadvantage of making too much noise.Parachute flares are very useful for night reconnaissance.As regards the enemy1s defensive measures against night reconnaissance machines; complaints received are chiefly concerned with the blinding effect of searchlights, which my render all reconnaissance impossible; anti-aircraft and machine gun fire has not been heavynAn organisation for night reconnaissances, involving special equipment of units, is under consideration All concerned will be informed.(Signed) LUDENDORFF.SHORTAGE OP PETROL- An order issued by the XIV Reserve Ct*rps (Cambrai front) on the loth. Sept, ember a quoting instructions issued by the G.0,C, Air FofCe, and ci rcu3 ated&quot; down to batteries, shows that the enemy is at present suffering from a shortage of petrol; a translation of this order is given belovr,**&quot;According to instructions from the G,OeC Air Forces No. 27551&apos;J&apos; Full the strictest economy in the use of potrol for aircraft engines is absolutely nece&amp;sar-y.   The situation compeJb Us to ration psb-pdt   High-powered engines consume much petrol and the su&quot;-*?3y is comparatively small, &quot;so that only such flights as are ihdisp.enea&apos;ble*/will be carried out. The accomplishment of several tasks during one flight   should be attempted whenever possible.Steps should in all cases be taken to avoid keeping aeroplanes&quot;&quot;waiting for any length 0&quot;f time, when engaged on  -artillery registration, until the registering   battery is ready to firOe   Every delay entails unnecessary petrol con-sumption and may jeopardize the execution of other important missions.For special information and promulgated to 0.0*8batteries.(Signed) Graets.   22/9/18.&quot;/SRMANY,Aeroplanes.      The new Fokker monoplane 15*V, is reported as having a speed of 150 mph, at ground level and a climb to 4,500(gl metv en i;n 11% mins. when fitted with the 160 H.P. SiemensSchucke-rt engine-A Siemens schuckeyt monoplane is stated to be expectedat the Front shortly.A new Roland (probably D6Vl) is said to&apos; be about to be issued shortly to Units on the Western Front.The Junker Fokker Co ; have produced a new infantry machine called the J*II,   This is regarded mo^e favourably by pilots than the JQI,
A modified Albatros Single skater fighti p is reported as already in use.   It differs from its predecessors in that its fuselage io more stumpy thus remedying the weakness that the Albatross D.V. suffered from.An Albatross CnXV. is stated to be in existence and will &quot;II be issued for the use of artillery and oloso roconnaissanoe.Engines, A new engine of 360 H,P,, made by Han so Lloyd is statedto be under  -manufacture at BREMMT,A report states that there are two new rotary engines under manufacture - the 140 II-?c Oberursol and the 160 H*P, Goero.   Both firms are known to have been employed on engines of the rotary type.Armament.        It is reported that experiments arc in hand in Germany with&apos;&quot;a new 14 m,m, calibre automatic gun oapable of firing 25 rounds in quick succession,A new typo of incendiary bomb is reported from KIEL.EVACUATION Off BELGIAN COAST BY.THEi GERMAN, AIR FORCES.Tho oapture of the Belgian coast has necessitated tho evacuation of tho German Seaplane bases at ZEEBPUGGE and OSTEND, and the 6 aerodromes that acoommodated the naval   land flights, and in addition the 5 aerodromes used by the 3rd bombing squadron.jEAPLANES. The total nuinber of seaplanes at OS TEND and ZEEBRUGGEwas approximately 30 and 80 respectively.   The above two bases situated on the Belgian coast proved extremely useful as the machines v/ore employed on the following systematic patrols.. (1)   RECONNAISSANCE AND FIGHTER PATROLS,From the coast &quot;of FLANDERS&quot; to (&apos;h**;&quot;The North Foreland as far North as tho LEMAN Bank Lightship (30 miles EaBt of Cromer) (b)   The territorial waters of the Dut^h Coast as far as Terscholling Bank Lightship, from whence^   tho patrol was oarried on by the machines from BORKUM and other North Sea bases.OCATION. No information   has yet been received to show where themachines from tho evacuated bases are now housed. It is oon* sidered probable that the present existing stations at BORKUM and NORDENLY will be reinforoed by these machines,IebERAL 3ITUATI0N.   Although machines from BORKUM will be able to carry out the   IEIIAN 3A1TK - HAR7ICH - KENTISH KNOCK PATROL as far as fuel endurance is conoerncd the journey will entail difficulties for tho following reasons:- (1) Machines engaged in a contest off the East Coast of England may net be destroyed or driven down, yet nevertheless be damaged enough to prevent them setting baok to BORKUM; whereas it was a comparatively oasy mattor to struggle home to the coast of Flandero0   (2) The unsettled weather conditions of the North Sea will also limit the number of distant patrol3.   The distance from OSTEND to LEMAN Light vessel is approximately 100 miles each way, and from BORKUM to LEMM Light vessel 17o miles eaoh way,BRQPLANESt The naval land forces amounted to about 100 maoninesmostly two-seater, whoso duties were divided up between the Naval sea foroeo and the German 4th Army,   The jaaohines oarried out spot lag for the big short   batteries that were in constant action against our naval forces and constituted an aerial defence against bomb raids that were oarried out against their naval base3, aerodromes, railway centres, dump3, etc.LOCATION, No information has been received a3 to where thesenaval land foroes will go.   They will probably cither take up a position further South and reinforce the military machines under the command of the German 4th Army, or be sent to reinforoe the land protective flights in the vicinity of KIEL, CUXHAVEN, TONDER and NORDHOLZ, where a certain number of flights exist,

The machine at Messrs, Beardmore&apos;s should be flying on the 26th instant,B, Further experimental work on the Dragonfly Engine has been carried out at Sheffield with satisfactory results. Distribution troubles have been overcome by a circular induction pipe, and as the result of tests a power of 340 HIP, at 17 GO r,.p*m5 was obtained and held for if minutes. As the tes t was carried out in escargot limitations of cooling prevented a longer run at this power.     The pooling obtained by the engine in flight will, of course, be muen superior,     Tho sect.*.ement of this distribution question practically completes the proving of the present -design of Dragonfly Engine,
