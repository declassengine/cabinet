vVTTMsDociimetit&apos; Is the Property-of His Britannic Majesliy^^Governnient.],   CONFIDENTIAL. Political Intelligence Department,L    --,-j   [September 19, 1918.] Foreign Office.Rumania/002.fay .MEMORANDUMonTHE MEANING AND EFFECT OF THE BTJCAREST &quot; PEACE TREATY.&quot;[With Map.]IN the following&apos; memorandum an attempt is made to set forth the most important aspects of the Peace Treaty concluded on the 7th May last between Rumania and the Central Powers together with its corollaries the Legal and Economic Treaties and the Petroleum, Shipping, and Commercial Conventions between Rumania and Germany and Austria-Hungary respectively.The political meaning and consequences of this treaty and the attached conventions may be best discussed from the two points of view : 1. What safeguards Germany thought it advisable to take alike militarily, politi-cally, and economically against any hostile action of Rumania against her now or in the future.2. What political and economic conditions she has indicated by the treaty that she favours in Rumania with a view to definitely bringing that country or the ruling forces in it into line with the policy supported by the Central Powers.This second point may seem an altogether subsidiary factor in influencing German policy with regard to the peace conditions imposed. It is indeed subsidiary to the primary consideration that it was considered essential to German interests to dispose of Ruman I cl RS ci military and economic factor so completely as to prevent any trouble there to German policy during the rest of the war. Alike from the military and economic point of view, Germany, in other words, was pressed for time. She felt the urgent necessity of concluding a speedy peace with Rumania so as to free all her troops on that front, with the exception of the 60,000 men left as garrison, for removal to the Western front where she was then carrying out the series of grand offensives which finally ended with such disastrous results in July. And again, from the economic point of view, what German statesmen, even the most far-sighted of them, had primarily to consider was, as in the case of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, not the detailed settlement of Germany&apos;s relations with Eastern Europe, but the necessity of procuring the immediate provision for the German public of the foodstuffs and other raw materials of which it stands in such urgent need. This being the case, the risk had to be run&quot; of wounding Rumanian opinion more than might have been favoured in less urgent circumstances. For that the German authorities were, in spite of their declarations that they were anxious for friendship with-Rumania, perfectly well aware that their peace treaty had not helped on such friendship is shown by Kiihlmanns admission in the Reichstag on the 21st June : &quot; Certainly, after the experiences of this war, complete and undivided trust cannot return immediately.&quot;Nevertheless, the second point the consideration of the germs of a future perma-nent policy towards Rumania, as contained in the treaty is no idle one. In so far as the necessities confronting Germany allow of any such free action on the part of German diplomacy as regards the establishment of a future complete policy towards Rumania, the German authorities appear, at least in their own eyes, to have embarked on such a policy. To the impartial observer there is not, in fact, in practice at least if not in theory, any really fundamental contradiction between the policy temporarily adopted by the Central Powers of exploiting conquered Rumania for the relief of their own necessities and the policy of permanently arranging conditions in the country in such a way as to favour its indefinite control by Germany and Austria-Hungary. It is, in fact, only in form that a contradiction arises, but just the fact of this contradiction in form may prove in the long run the most valuable - factor in permanently affecting RumamVs relations with Germany. To take one illustration of such action it is perfectly clear that Germany would willingly have waived the military occupation of the country, and have made every allowance for Rumanian &quot;patriotic [367-43] ^ B01
feelings could she have been sure that, at a time when she is so hard-pressed as at present, such an absence of direct military control would not be turned to use against her in immediate military operations. (It must not be forgotten that there are close on 500,000 Rumanian trained soldiers left.)While the treaty and the series of conventions attached provide in almost every paragraph striking instances of the way in which the Central Powers either openly or disguisedly have secured for themselves complete control over Rumania, it is impossible in a short memorandum to enter into every such detail. But a few illustrations may be considered of the different forms of control established as illuminating examples of German policy, and with a view to their&apos; immediate and probable effects on Rumanian opinion.1. Territorial Annexations.In the map attached it will be noticed what are the so-called &quot;rectifications of frontier &quot; which the Central Powers have considered it in their interest to establish. On the side of Austria-Hungary they consist of the cession by Rumania of the whole crest of the Carpathians, comprising every strategetic point of access to Rumania, and in one or two places, particularly in the Bistrita Valley, very considerable additions to this. Altogether the amount of territory ceded is, according to Rumanian estimates, 5,000 square kilom. to Hungary and 2,300 square kilom. to Austria. Included in this territory are 167 villages and a population of 130,000. The reasons for which the cession of territory was demanded are primarily strategic ones ; through them Austria-Hungary would henceforth hold Rumania entirely at her mercy. It is perhaps no accident, however, that in the territory ceded is included all the finest forest country of Rumania and the rich coal-fields of Paringu (near Petroseny). As Austria-Hungary has no particular wish to increase the numbers of her subject-populations she has made no objection to the inhabitants of the territory ceded being granted the option of retaining their Rumanian citizenship and leaving the country. But as regards the economic resources of the territories, the Austrian and Hungarian Governments take over ali State property as their own and, as has been continuously the German practice with regard to territories lopped off enemy States, the territory annexed is freed from any financial or other obligation hitherto due from it as part of the Rumanian kingdom.With regard to Dobrogea everything has been taken from Rumania except the small marshy delta enclosed by the mouths of the Danube (the boundaries are shown on the attached map). As regards Rumania it is a matter of comparative unimportance whether the Dobrogean question is settled in a German or Bulgarian direction, for the conclusion must naturally be ruled out that the Entente Powers would consent, as certain Bulgars appear to believe, to the annexation by Bulgaria of the whole province up to the mouths of the Danube. As regards the province (apart from the two southern districts annexed by Rumania, in 1913 where the population is about 45 per cent. Bulgar and 47 per cent. Turco-Tatar) Dobrogea, as incorporated in Rumania in 1878, contains a Rumanian majority varying from 50 to 55 per cent., while even the Bulgars cannot claim more than lfi to 18 per cent, of the population. The Central Powers pay no heed to such facts and, if they recognise that Constanta is necessary to Rumania as her only important outlet to the Black Sea, they do so in their own interests, for, keeping in their hands the control of the Cernavoda-Constanta Railway, as well as the temporary control of all the Rumanian railways, they naturally make this &quot; concession &quot; to Rumania entirely in their own interests. It is pointed out by &quot; R.&quot;* that for the moment the strategic control of Dobrogea is of vital importance to the Germans. So long as it remains in their occupation they would be able to deal summarily with any possible revolt that might break out in Wallachia, for they would be in a position to cut off between Galatz and the Carpathians any attempt at co-operation between the Rumanians in Wallachia and in Moldavia.The rectifications of the Rumanian frontier with Austria-Hungary and the seizure of Dobrogea are therefore measures dictated both by urgent military and economic needs and by political schemes for the future.2. Economic Control.The urgent need in which the Central Powers find themselves of securing the greatest possible supply of foodstuffs and raw materials, such as petroleum, necessary for* &quot; R,&quot; who is quoted from time to time throughout this memorandum, is Colonel R. Rosetti, D.S.O., of the Rumanian Army, who kindly compiled some notes on the implications, of the treaty.
the conduct of the war, naturally finds expression in the conditions of the treaty. In the first place, by article 20 the army of occupation has the right to requisition cereals, fruits, vegetables, wool, cattle, and meat, as well as timber, crude oil and oil products, available from the output of 1918. This right of requisition has been applied to the most extreme degree. According to the &quot;Pester Lloyd&quot; (21st July) the import of sheep from Rumania to Hungary began at the end of June, and the paper reports that more than 100,000 animals had already crossed the frontier.As regards grain the Germans brought pressure to bear on the Rumanian Govern-ment* to guarantee them 120,000 tons of grain, - threatening otherwise to confiscate the whole 1918 crop. As tilings have turned out, the harvest has been extremely bad, owing to severe droughts in every part of Rumania and Bessarabia, except the south-west corner, Oltenia (Little Wallachia). The Rumanian authorities, however, are not permitted to use the surplus in Oltenia to meet the appalling deficits in other parts of the country, but this surplus output is claimed by the Germans as their share under the agreement. But, apart from immediate necessities, the German authorities have arranged for tying to their use all the agricultural output of Rumania in the future. For the next seven years from 1919 all Rumania&apos;s surplus grain is automatically to be at the disposal of the Central Powers, at prices to be determined annually by a mixed commission, and, should the Powers wish it, the engagement may be further prolonged, the proviso being added chat all iuties levied by Rumania shall be borne by the seller. The duty of determining the surplus is assigned to a joint Austro-German and Rumanian commission, and the method of obtaining, receiving, and paying for the commodities will be determined by an Export Office to be set up by the Rumanian Government in conjunction with the Bureau to be set up in Rumania by Germany and Austria-Hungary, the representative of which Bureau is to be kept informed of all business proceedings of the Export Office. In return, Germany and Austria-Hungary generously undertake to facilitate the export to Rumania of all manufactured goods, raw materials, &amp;c, particularly those needed to increase agricultural production, which amounts to establishing for the Central Powers in Rumania a monopoly of the sale of these goods against other European Powers.The arrangements made for the production and export of petroleum are similarly arbitrary. The Rumanian Government is forced to concede for thirty years the exclusive right of exploiting all the State oilfields hitherto unexploited and also, under certain nominal reserves, the resumption of all concessions to the &quot; Oil Lands Leasing Company (Limited).&quot; In this company all the preference shares are put at the exclusive disposal of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and these shares will carry 50 votes each. As for the founders&apos; shares, one-quarter will be at the disposal of the Rumanian Government. Of the rest, a quarter is set aside for Austria-Hungary, and the remaining &quot; 50 per cent, will remain over for Germany.&quot;! Germany therfore establishes complete control over the policy and actions of the company. Similarly, the sole rights of export are confided to a Commercial Monopoly Society founded by the German and Austro-Hungarian Governments, the control of the shares of which are assigned in the same proportion as that of the society^ above mentioned to the Central Powers. These two societies possess practically plenary jurisdiction over the entire petroleum industry of Rumania. Not only is every facility for the use and construction of railways put at their disposal, no: only is the Rumanian Government prevented from exercising any customs or financial control over their activities, but the society can force the Rumanian authorities to grant it any privileges, whether of transport, timber, or storage, that it considers useful to it. Nor is controversy of any avail, for cases of dispute between these two societies and Rumanian firms will be decided finally at a Court at Leipzig.Lastly, Rumania has been forced to agree to the complete surrender to German economic interests of the control over her own natural resources. German nationals and German societies and associations are permitted by article 7 of the Economic Treaty to acquire real and movable property in the towns of any nature at all, and in the country to rent for thirty years all real property they consider necessary to their industrial enterprises. They cannot be submitted to any other restrictions except such as also apply to Rumanian citizens. Under this articlej there can obviously be no assurance that the greater part of real estate in Rumania might not before long be in the possession of foreigners.   By article 9 of the same Economic Treaty all previous-   * This is &quot; R.&apos;s &quot; statement.f The authority for this statement is a well-informed article by an expert in the Frankfurter Zeitung, May 9, 1918, but according- to a statement in the Berlin Banca-Archiv, January 15, p. 186, note 52, one-third, of the founders&apos; shares are set aside for Austria-Hungary.\ &quot; R.&quot;
conventions and tariffs with the Central Powers are so modified as to favour the impor of German goods into Rumania, none of which goods may &quot; under any pretext be more heavily taxed than those products in the country itself.&quot;   Such a clause obviously puts the development of Rumanian industry entirely at the mercy of Germany.   The other articles of this Economic Treaty are all similarly conceived.3. Financial Control.By articles 42 and 43 of the Legal Treaty, Rumanian finance is definitely enslaved to Germany. Rumania is forced to agree that the credits and deposits of the Rumanian National Bank with the German Reichsbank shall be held as security for the service of the Rumanian public debt as regards German subjects for a period of five years, and in the interests of these subjects may be drawn upon for ten years to make good any instalment which Rumania falls behind with, and for the discharge of interest due and redeemed bonds. Further, more precise arrangements for the fulfilment and assurance of liumamVs financial obligations were to be decided within four weeks of the signature of the treaty by representatives of the contracting parties in Berlin; but nothing seems to have been published as to their decisions. Germany is, however, forcing Rumania, under article 5 of the Legal Treaty, to make herself responsible for the redemption, by means of notes of the National Bank or other legal forms of payment, of the notes issued by the Banca Generala Romana on the order of the German Military Occupation. Till so redeemed, the notes of the Banca Generala Romana shall be recognised as legal tender. Up till the time of the signature of peace, it may be noted, the Banca Generala Romana, which is a creation of the Disconto-Gesellschaft, had issued 1 milliard of lei worth of paper money.Even in small matters, such as the payment of cost for transport of returned prisoners and repatriated civilians, the Germans have taken care to bleed Rumania. Thus, while there are many Rumanian prisoners of war in Germany and few civilians interned, and while quite the contrary is the case with German soldiers and civilians respectively in Rumanian hands, it is arranged that each party should pay for the transport of returned prisoners, while the transport of interned civilians shall be free. In spite of this fact, it may be noted, Rumanian prisoners of war, apparently for political reasons, are not being released from Germany.4. Political Strangleholds.It is above all with regard to their handling of the political situation that the Germans have had to accommodate their views as to Rumania&apos;s future to the exigencies of the moment. The full security against Rumania taking action against the Central Powers later, should occasion arise, is aimed at through the military terms of the treaty. The whole Rumanian army is demobilised with the exception of a certain number of the first ten divisions, two of which are left in Bessarabia, while the remaining eight are allowed to be maintained at a reduced peace strength. Apart from the two divisions in Bessarabia, the total number of men not demobilised must not exceed 32,200, and only a very small amount of ammunition is left at their disposal, nor are any reservists allowed to be called up for training until the signing of the general peace. On the other hand, the German army of occupation in Wallachia may amount to and will, not exceed 60,000 men, which is considered, and for the moment obviously is, adequate to repress any discontents. The whole cost of the upkeep of this, army is, according to article 21 of the treaty, to be borne by Rumania. &quot;R.&quot; notes that the. Germans have demanded 360,000,000 lei from Rumania, which would amount to 6,000 fr. per head for each soldier per annum, or six times the normal cost of the maintenance of a German soldier in peace time. By various articles of the different treaties the military command is left in control of all the vital ways of communication. Railways, posts, and telegraphs, for instance, will remain till further orders in the hands of the military administration, though, of course, put at the disposal of the Rumanian authorities and population (article 17). By article 15 the military administration reserves to itself the exercise of all the powers it has hitherto enjoyed, and though the civil administration of the occupied territory reverts to the Rumanian authorities, their exercise of this administration is completely tied by the fact that by article 17 a civil official of the military administration is attached to each of the Rumanian Ministries until the evacuation of the occupied territories, the object of this provision being humorously stated as being &quot; to facilitate as far as possible the transfer of the civil administration to the Rumanian authorities.&quot;   As, further, the Rumanian authorities are obliged to
103comply with the regulations which the chiefs of the army of Occupation consider &quot; necessary for the security of the occupied, territories,&quot; and &quot; offences against the army of occupation &quot; a very vague phrase are to be tried by its military courts, the actual sovereignty of the Rumanian Government is practically a farce.The treatment of the educational question provides yet another of the countless possible illustrations which might be given of German policy as exemplified in the treaty. By article 27 of the Peace Treaty the &quot; same liberty and legal protection on the part of the authorities&quot; is demanded &quot;for the Roman Catholic, Protestant, Muhammadan, and Israelite religions as for the Rumanian Orthodox.&quot; &quot; These religions will in particular have the right of setting up parishes and communities, and founding schools which will be considered as private sch tols, and can only be forbidden in case of danger to the security of the State or disturbance of public order.&quot; This clause, in appearance a plea for tolerance, is, in fact, intended to supply a demand which does not yet exist. There is no demand for either Roman Catholic or Protestant schools in Rumania in the sense hinted at by the treaty. What is desired is that the German and Austro-Hungarian Governments may at will create throughout the country as many, in appearance innocent, centres of propaganda as they may think fit. Nor do they confine their educational propaganda to foreign schools. By clause 3 of article 15 of the Legal and Political Convention between Puimania and Austria-Hungary the two parties bind themselves only to permit school-books or other educa-tional material the contents of which do not contravene the promise given in the opening sentence of the article, that the contracting parties bind themselves not to tolerate in their respective territories any sort of propaganda or action directed, primarily or indirectly, against the territorial integrity, security, or public order of the other party. This clause, therefore, may be used so as to stifle for ever the teaching to young Rumanians of the history of their race, and of a great part of their national literature. It is tantamount to establishing a precedent for the safe control by the Austro-Hungarian authorities of all the educational activities of Rttmania.No purpose would be served by examining in greater detail the further provisions made in the treaty by the Central Powers to restrict Rumania&apos;s political freedom, but two practical instances may be given of the spirit in which the German Government is controlling Rumania.Under instructions from its creators, the Marghiloman Government has passed a law obliging all peasants men from 14 to 60, women .from 14 to 50 to work on the land. As these laboureis can be transferred by the will of the authorities from one part of the country to another, they are practically in the condition of slaves. By this measure the Germans have provided themselves with a powerful weapon for controlling the huge peasant population. But more important than this, it is also a measure of control over the landowning classes, since such landowners as refuse to accept a German orientation can be cut off from their supply of labour, and their properties consequently taken away from then! on the ground that they are not supplying their quota of the food which Rumania is pledged to provide. The German authorities similarly control all agricultural machinery. Again, the. production and export of food is under complete autocratic control. A &quot; General Economic Directory &quot; has been created, at the head of which has been put Dr. Antipa, an extreme pro-German by education and sympathy. * Plis powers include the fixing of the quantity of goods to be exported, the requisitioning of such goods, the rationing of foodstuffs, and almost every other side of Rumanians economic life. He is responsible only to the Prime Minister, and is therefore practically a dictator.The Central Powers have not hesitated to interfere in the most flagrant way with the internal affairs of Rumania. It is said that during the peace negotiations the Rumanian plenipotentiary found it hardest to accept of all the German demands the demand that Rumania should grant a &quot; complete amnesty to all Rumanians for their political conduct or military attitude based on political motives during the war&quot; (article 32, section 2). Under this provision, which the Rumanians were compelled to accept, not only the pro-German politicians but direct traitors such as Colonel Sturdza, Colonel Yerzea, and others who had betrayed and deserted the cause of their country are fully reinstated. The German object was, of course, not only to strengthen the pro-German party in Rumania, but to show the world that service to the German cause never goes unrewarded. Corresponding measures of revenge are taken against all those considered responsible for Rumania&apos;s declaration of war on the Central Powers. M. Bratianu and his late colleagues have been impeached for their policy. It is true that Ktihlmann in his speech on the 21st June in the Reichstag declared : &quot; This action* &quot;Lumina,&quot; June 20/July 3. [367-43] 0
against the Bratianu Cabinet comes from the Rumanian people of their own free will without any attempt at pressure from outside.&quot; It is also true that the Marghiloman Government and its supporters have seized with joy the chance of revenging them-selves on their old opponents. Lastly, it is true that the act of indictment dwells on the unconstitutional methods of which, it may be maintained, the Bratianu Government was guilty in embarking on a policy and an enormous expenditure of public moneys without real authorisation from the Parliament of the country. But, in fact, whether there is or is not a legitimate ground of complaint against M. Bratianu for certain of his acts, it is clear that the action of the Marghiloman Government against him and his fellow Ministers is chiefly dictated by their pro-German animus. The reply of the accused Ministers, read in the Chamber on the 5th August, dwelt in a dignified way on the fact that the war, which they are accused for entering on, is the &quot; naturaloutcome of our national development.....   At the present time we await withconfidence its conclusive results and proudly appeal to history to judge us.&quot; The Marghiloman Government was unable to rely on the Supreme Judicial Court giving a judgment against the Ministers accused, and has therefore not hesitated to place them under preventive arrest and to threaten to appoint a court ad hoc to condemn them. Parliament, which is their creature, has agreed to these demands. M. Bratianu and his colleagues are obviously justified in refusing to recognise any trace of moral or legal authority in such a sentence.In yet a third way the German authorities and their Rumanian creatures have definitely interfered in the internal politics of the country. Some months ago (at the end of May) they arrested in Bucarest the leaders of the so-called Socialist party, Mme. Arbure, M. Petrescu, and others, on the ground that they were spreading revolutionary ideas. This is the more instructive in view of the fact that this party, which was always strongly neutralist, was openly favoured by the Germans during 1915 and L916 before Rumania&apos;s intervention. According to later news, however, these Socialists appear to have been released.But apart from direct attempts to destroy opposition to their policy in Rumania and to safeguard themselves against any further trouble there, the Central Powers have also been thinking of the future, and it is quite clear that here as elsewhere they are looking for support to vested interests, whether political or financial.   Comprised in the Marghiloman Government are some of the biggest landholders in Rumania; men like Grigorie Cantacuzino (one of the richest and most reactionary boyars in Rumania) are included.   It is obviously to this class that the Germans can look for support not only temporarily but indefinitely, for on German support alone can they depend for the maintenance of their regime of exploitation of the country.   The first act of the Maro&apos;hiloman Government was to annul all the sweeping electoral and agrarian reforms the Rumanian Parliament passed last year with a view to their incorporation in the Constitution,   ft is true that Marghiloman at the same time promised to bring in reforms of his own, and that the Speech from the Throne definitely spoke of &quot; revision of the Constitution so that in the shortest period and before any other constitutional change we may carry out agrarian reform and awaken the lower classes of the nation to real political life.&quot;   It was on these conditions that such persons as M. Stere, an ardent social reformer, expressed their desire to work with the Government, but they are long since disillusioned.   The fact that a reactionary like M. Garoflid has been appointed Minister of Agriculture should show that there is little to be expected for reform from such a quarter.   M. Marghiloman has dwelt on the necessity of maintaining large properties in the interests of production and scientific agriculture.   He is now proposing legislation by which all landowners will lease 10 per cent, to 30 per cent, of their land to various peasant associations for five years.   No details of this legislation have yet reached us, but it would appear certain that the Government and the landowners will, under the conditions proposed, retain as much control as heretofore over the adminis-tration of the country.   At the same time he. declares that, while intending electoral reforms, he cannot admit to full rights the illiterate population (which is the huge majority).   The elections at the beginning of June gave the Government sweeping majorities in both Houses.   In fact, there is practically no opposition at all.   This was to be expected, as the parties of M. Bratianu and M. Take Ionescu did not contest the elections.   It is becoming clear to everyone in the country that electoral and agrarian reform in the mouth of M. Marghiloman mean merely such changes or adaptations of the existing regime as may happen to suit the interests of his party.   At the same time, though the Germans, through their political support and the financial inducements they offer to the propertied classes to share with them on their own terms in the exploitation of the country, are putting their main confidence in this class of society,

they are not neglecting other factors. Till recently, at least they had done a great deal to conciliate the peasants and to encourage them to look to Germany for protection against their own landlords. Similarly, they have definitely embittered feeling over the Jewish question. By articles 27 and 28 of the Peace Treaty, they have demanded and secured From Rumania the conferring of certain rights on the Jews. Their solution is no complete one of the Jewish question, but this appears to be intentional, for it is in the German interest to leave the question unsolved in order that they may play one side against the other, and themselves enjoy the r61e of arbiters and supporters of each in turn. (The question is so complicated that it must be left for a subsequent memorandum.)All these are a few of the many instances which might be given of the way in which Germany has secured her control over the internal affairs of Rumania. It is a control based, of course, on the right of the stronger and on the belief (which they calculate that the Rumanian public, practically cut off from Western Europe, may come to share) that, whatever the issue of the war elsewhere, East and South-East Europe will definitely fall within the German sphere of influence. In the main, probably for reasons of temporary necessity, as we have seen, but perhaps also for psychological reasons peculiarly German, their whole policy is based on the maxim &quot; Let them hate so long as they fear me.&quot; From any general point of view of the interests of the world, and from any far-sighted Rumanian patriotic point of view, it is well that the Germans have so bluntly shown their intentions of exploiting and bullying Rumania, explaining at the same time that that is what they mean by &quot;friendship.&quot; It would be no exaggeration to say that Germanopbilism in the narrowest sense is less widespread in Rumania than it has ever been. Even so old a pro-German as M. Carp is said to have remarked : &quot;I dont know my Germans any longer.&quot; Already there is rising discontent all over the country. Not only the large political parties of M. Bratianu and M. Take Ionescu, many of whose leaders have remained in Rumania, while others, including M. Take Ionescu himself, are taking prominent part in the organisation of a National Rumanian Committee in Paris, at the head of which are Dr. loan Cantacuzino and the Transylvanian Uniate priest Father Lucaci, are unappeased and active, and, according to Bulgarian papers,* &quot;their intrigues are continuous and vigorous, while they are spreading in the country the idea that Rumania may once again constitute a new Eastern front&quot;; not only are these men opposing and intriguing against the German occupation, but even other parties, less historically anti-German,^ are acting in the same way. We have seen the discontent of M. Stere with his former ally Marghiloman. His point of view is shared by a very large body of hitherto non-party revolutionaries. Further, the Germans have to reckon against them the bulk of disillusioned Socialist feeling, for what it is worth, in the country; and lastly, there is the body of free-lances who have grouped themselves round General Averescu and who carry on a political guerilla war against the Marghiloman. Government. Little as these men may count in political ability, they rank among their supporters a great number of army officers and other Rumanians indignant at the way in which their country has been treated.The elimination of Bulgaria from the war and the advance of the Allied armies may very shortly offer the chance of these discontents finding their expression in a universal rising of the country against the Germans. The question of how or by whom this movement will be directed must be reserved for treatment elsewhere.I* &quot;Dnevnik&quot; (August 22)
