i9    iTHIS DOCUMENT 11: THE PRnFTOTVO?&quot; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT).S E C R E.l\G. T. 6054WAR CABINET. ROAD RECONSTRUCTION.;Copy of letter from Mr. j^oyn^oj^ioks^ --td&quot;i6&quot;?rime Minister.15, St. James&apos;a Placec3 w15th October, 1918.My Dear Prime Minister,Amongst my activities is that of Chairman of the Automobile Association and Vice-President of the Roads Improvement Association;   hence my interest in this question.May I put the following position before you:-(1)   The roads of the country are in a worse condition than &quot;they have been for fifty years.(2)   Large sums of money will have to be spent upon them immediately the war is over.(3)   I believe Mr, Addison&apos;s Committee has considered the matter in a general way and roughly agreed that 50 million should be spent, but &quot;they have prepared no plans.(4)   There would be grave hostility on the part 6f the Local Authorities to any military control such as the Road Transport Organization now run by the War Office,(5)   The Road Board, of which Sir George Gibb is Chairman and Lord Montague of Beaulieu, Lord St, Davids, Lord Pirrie and Sir A. Macdonald are Members, has the confidence of the Local Authorities, and I think of the Road users also.(6)    Peace may possibly be upon u-  at any moment, and demobi-lisation will let loose a large amount of labour which quite con-ceivably may not be easily absorbed.(7)   The simplest method of utilising unskilled labour is roadmaking.This cannot be done unless plans are prepared before hand and this should be done immediately, as the negotiations with the various Road Authorities and the financial arrangements with the Treasury would necessarily take some months&apos;-.(8)   The Engineer and Secretary of the Road Board is General Maybury, who has done wonders with the roads in France, and 1 understand that Sir Douglas Haig would be willing to.allow him to corrfejfffere for some weeks in the &quot;dead&quot; part of the year, be-tween November wid February, if what I propose meets with the approval of the v!*ar Cabinet.
(9)   Sir George Gibb is due for retirement in 1920, and I think it possible he would be willing to retire much earlier on. terms (though I have not his authority for saying so).(10)   Any scheme such as I suggest should be initiated by the new Chairman, and not by one who has had nine years in the post and is just about to retire.(11)   There is a Member of the existing Board who, I think, would make a good Chairman, but I should say that owing to the other work of Lord Pirrie and the great age of Sir A. Macdonald, the Board needs outside strengthening.(12)   So far as I can see, nk Board or Committee of any kind is yet prepared to set to work with existing plans * the moment Peace is declared, and this I submit is essential, not merely from the road but from the labour point of view.I venture to ask the consideration by the Cabinetof this letter,      ?w.Yours sincerely,, ^(SD.) W. JOYNSON HICKS.The Rt. HonrThe Prime Minister
