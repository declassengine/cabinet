Report from the Ministry of Labour for the week ending the 16th October, 1918.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The attitude of labour in view of the Peace Notes is discussed.Part II.: Press Comments.The opinion of the Labour press on military matters, including the German Peace Notes and the exchange of prisoners; on foreign affairs, with reference to Russia ; on home politics, with reference to separation allowances and the purchase of the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; ; on home affairs, with reference to strikes; and on food is described.Part III: District Reports.The industrial situation generally is tranquil.Part IV: Disputes.(a.) Involving a Stoppage of Work. No serious strike has been reported. (b.) Not involving a Stoppage of Work. The only dispute of importance is that of the surface workers.I.-General Remarks.The Reception of the Peace Notes.The industrial position during the week has been abnormally tranquil, and public interest is centred on the possibility of early peace negotiations.The reception of President Wilson&apos;s Note in the labour world, so far as can he judged from expressions of opinion which have been received, is overwhelmingly favourable. The Labour Party appears to be in entire accord with the attitude adopted by President Wilson in both his Notes, and these also seem to command almost without exception the support of that section of labour which has been looked upon as pacifist.Before the receipt of President Wilson&apos;s first Note, the demand for immediate negotiation with a view to peace was expressed in certain quarters, but in view of the almost unanimous acceptance of the point of view expressed in President Wilson&apos;s second Note, the premature manifesto by Mr. John Hill, of the Boilermakers, and the opinion of Mr. Robert Williams that it was a case of immediate peace or general insurrection, are now of little interest.In the industrial world the effect of the expectation of an early peace in certain quarters has been a relaxation of effort on the part of the workers. This very natural symptom indicates a danger against which it will be necessary to guard. It would also appear desirable that all possible steps should be taken to maintain that unity in support of the Government which has been apparent since negotiations began. Probably the best method of securing this end would be that the public should be kept informed, as far as that is possible, from time to time, of the actual position and of the necessity&apos; for the various steps in preliminary negotiations as they are taken.[1100-51] . B
(A.) Military,The German Peace Note,The publication of the German peace note encourages a demand for immediate negotiations among the more pacific section of the Labour press the political complexion of the new German Government and. the character of the new Chancellor, Prince Max, being alleged sufficient grounds for immediate acquiescence on the part of the Allies, Mr. Brailsford, in the &quot; Herald,&quot; claims that the Chancellor owes his position to the lieichstag majority, which with each successive crisis has added to its prestige. It first of all drew up a programme and outlined a policy, and now finally it has made a Government as well. To say that Max was called by the Kaiser to form his Govern -ment signified about as much as the Kings calling Mr. Lloyd George in 1916. Reference is made to Prince Max&apos;s efforts on behalf of prisoners of war, to the &quot; Times&apos;&quot; ungrudging praise of his work, and to the high opinion in which he was held by Ambassador Gerard. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; is also at some pains to establish the democratic nature of the new Government, which, it thinks, is as well authorised to speak for Germany as President Wilson is for the United States of America. The &quot; Call,&quot; however, considers that the process of disintegration will probably be carried a stage further, and will eventuate either in a Revolution or a military dictatorship,The &quot;Clarion&quot; in a leading article advocates rejection of the German.offer in favour of a dictated peace, pointing out that Prince Max, when subsequently called upon to defend his famous &quot; sermon on the mount &quot; speech, took occasion to belaud the German sword and to cast aspersions upon the popular outcry for democracy and all the current party watch vyords, especially &quot; Parliamentarianism.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot; claims that Germany has conceded all we asked for,and the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; goes on to show that any equivocation on our part will only go to prove the existence of ulterior motives for the continuance of the war.Both the &quot; Herald &quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; rejoice in the fact that Wilson did not consider it necessary to give a point-blank refusal, and the &quot; Herald &quot; considers this a great advance upon the policy of a &quot;knock-out blow&quot; or a dictated peace, for which a section of our press has recently been clamouring.The &quot; Clarion,&quot; in a characteristically vigorous article by Blatchford, entitled &quot; The Weeping of the Crocodile,&quot; enumerates some of the many woes that have befallen the conquered regions of Northern France and Belgium, suggests that the Germans should be made to feel what it means, in Bismarck&apos;s words, &quot; to have nothing left but eyes to weep with.&quot;Immediate action on the part of Labour in calling together an Inter-Allied Socialist and Labour Conference in order to reach a negotiated peace without the agency of their Governments is strongly advocated by the &quot; Call.&quot; Other papers suggest that the matter should be decided by a plebiscite. Camille Huysmans in the &quot; Herald&quot; calls for the immediate support of the Allied democracies, lest the German Social Democrats, whose presence is responsible for recent developments, should feel discouraged. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; and &quot;Workers&apos; Dreadnought&quot; demand that an ^qual willingness to abandon conquered territories should be shown by the Entente nations before asking Germany to effect a withdrawal.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; threatens the Allied Governments with revolution if conciliatory methods are not adopted. &quot; It is a dangerous thing surely for Governments to acclaim insurrection in a world bristling with millions of armed proletarians and fermenting with revolutionary ideas.&quot;&quot; Justice,&quot; on the other hand, thinks that the peace talk is all a trap to keep t)ae Allied armies out of Germany in order to give her time to recover and to proceed anew with her work of domination and destruction.Exchange of Prisoners.The &quot; Herald &quot; considers that the delay over the exchange of prisoners is intolerable, and begs the Government, in the name of common decency, to override the diplomatists imd get the men home at once.[b.)-F()reign Affairs.Russia.An attempt to whitewash the Soviets k aaaade in two articles in the &quot; Workers&apos; Dreadnought,&quot; one of these being from the pen of Arthur Ransome.   The &quot; Call&quot; givesII.-Press Comments.
a translation containing the Russian version, as given in the Russian papers, of the alleged British conspiracy in Russia, and describes the paragraphs about the Red Terror that have recently been appearing in the English press as lurid and lying. &quot; Forward,&quot; on the other hand, in the course of a long article, condemns the policy adopted by Lenin and Trotsky, and supports Kerensky&apos;s view of the necessity for Allied intervention.(0). Home Politics.Separation Allowances.The question of separation allowances is dealt&apos; with by the &quot; Herald,&quot; the &quot; Labour Leader&quot; and the &quot; Bradford Pioneer,&quot; all of which advocate that organised trades should take the same line of action in demanding a higher scale as has already been done by the Scottish miners.&quot; Daily Chronicle.&quot;The purchase of the &quot;Dairy Chronicle&quot; is ascribed by &quot;Forward&quot; to the activity of the paper in the matter of the British Cellulose Company and the great Dope scandal. &quot; Justice &quot; regrets the purchase as a blow at the political independence of the paper. The &quot;Railway Review&quot; is &quot;of the opinion that the amalgamation of newspaper interests is a menace to labour. Mr. Robert Williams in the &quot;Herald&quot; asserts that we have neither a military nor a political dictatorship, but that we are in the hands of a mischievous press. Papers, he maintains, are bought up in order to pollute public opinion at its source.(D.) Home Affairs.Strikes.Mr. Ramsay Macdonald contributes a long article to the &quot; Labour Leader,&quot; in the course of which he defends the I.L. P. against the charge of instigating strikes. The reasons in many cases he thinks are economic rather than political, such as the failure of wages to rise in response to increased prices. In other instances they are rather of the nature of a challenge of the Executive^ right to speak without consulting the men. Political strikes he thinks are dangerous on the whole as partaking of the nature of war, and he considers that the Government is too often to blame for not listening to the claims of reason, but preferring generally to wait for actual cessation of work before taking any action.(E.).-Food.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; alleges that the farmers&apos; demands in the case of milk prices were conceded by the Controller in order to prevent them turning to the production of other foodstuffs. &quot; Justice &quot; continues its campaign in favour of subsidies in the case of meat and milk.HI. District Reports.London and South-Eastern.The tinsmiths and sheet-metal workers at Cubitfs are discussing an increase in wages. The latter complain that work which should have been given to the sheet-metal workers is given to unskilled men. A &quot;deputation to the management, is to discuss both these points.There is a movement amongst tube, &apos;bus, and tram men to join forces. In the event of strikes they are assured of the full support of the London Workers&apos; Committee.

There is, a campaign amongst them for stronger organisation. Unrest continues among the woodworkers.West Midlands.Conditions appear to be generally satisfactory in this area. At Birmingham, how-ever, trouble is probable over the enli-tmeut of a fitter. This man left Vickers&apos;, Erith, and was about to start, work at Austin&apos;s when he was taken for the army. The Oldham District Committee of the A.S.E. are taking the matter up and the Executive Council are behind them.... [1100-511 B 2
