Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.

This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.

FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEMES, IRELAND.

G.T.6019

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s                                                    Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ended 16th October, 1918.

The following is a brief statement on the work of the Department during the past week in furtherance of increased Food Production in Ireland:-

LOANS FOR AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS.

Twenty-eight applications for loans for agricultural implements were received by the Department during the past week. The total value of machinery ordered from the beginning of the present year, to date, under the Scheme, amounts to Â£88,461.

COMPULSORY TILLAGE REGULATIONS.

Nothing calling for special comment has arisen in connection with the work of inspecting lands, which has been continued during the week.

In the case of holdings on which the Department entered last spring in exercise of their powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, arrangements are now being made to collect the rents from the persons to whom portions of such holdings were set by the Department in conacre, and steps are also being taken with a view to restoring possession of the lands to the occupiers when the Department&apos;s conacre tenants have removed their crops.

PROGRESS OF THE HARVEST.

The severe storm of the 5th and 6th instant, followed as it was by heavy rains, did considerable damage in certain parts of the country. Field stacks and stocks temporarily secured were in some cases scattered by the wind, and as a consequence there will be considerable loss through shedding.

Heavy rain rendered the land practically unworkable during the week, and little potato raising or ploughing of stubble could be done. Though there are reports from some districts of blackening and rotting of potatoes, the yield and quality are reported as generally good. Unless there is an improvement in the weather it will be difficult to work potato diggers except on very dry soil.

Turnips are reported to be bulbing fairly satisfactorily. Mangels are not doing so well. The raising of this crop is proceeding in the earlier districts.

The wet weather also prevented the preparation of the 16/10/18

 


ground for wheat sowing, but farmers are reported to have secured their seed, and are awaiting a favourable opportunity to have it sown.

FLAX.

Harvesting. Owing to a continuance of wet weather very little progress was made in occuring the flax still remaining in the fields.  At least one-half of the flax reserved for seed is so badly damaged that the seed will be only suitable for feeding purposes. The straw of this flax has also been seriously damaged.

Scutchers&apos; Dispute. Except in a very few districts scutchers are starting work, and the reports received show that the labour trouble is rapidly dwindling.

Scutching Results. The yields of scutched flax show great variations. On an average, however, the yields this season will probably be much under the average.

Attitude of Farmers. Farmers are generally seriously disheartened with this season&apos;s flax growing operations, owing to poor yields and returns, labour difficulties, and adverse weather conditions, and it is feared that this will load to a serious diminution in the area to be sown next year.

Scutching Operations.  The starting of scutching operations has been seriously retarded this season owing, to a limited extent, to labour troubles, but principally to the late harvest and to unfavourable weather.

Flaxseed (Ireland) Order, 1918. Last season it was found that mill owners were rather careless in obtaining the declarations from growers required under the Order, before accepting flax for scutching. A few cases of this nature have come to the Department&apos;s notice this season, and have been sent forward for prosecution. The number of cases of breaches of the Order on all accounts reported to date is 343.

MAINTENANCE OF LIVESTOCK.

During the period from 8th to 14th instant, inclusive, 154 applications for licences to slaughter or export heifers, 58 applications or licences to slaughter or export store? heifers and 83 applications for licences to slaughter bulls or bullocks were received. One hundred and twenty-five applications for licences to export milch cows also come to hand.

One licence was granted allowing of the exportation of 6 Shorthern in-calf heifers.
