SUBJECTS7&quot;Arrangements as regards susjtgnsirn f rcm emplryment duringthe War.Copy cf orrresecndencc between the Civil-Service Commissioner;and the Treasury.With reference tc the Cabinet decision of the 11th July con-*ar      tained in Minute 7^ the Chancellor of the Exchequer circulates the binet following extracts from correspondence between the Civil Service 4.      Commissioners and the Treasury:w!,ivil Service Commission, 23rd September, 1918.x ix. j\. x .x.&quot;I am directed by the Civil Service Commissioners to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s treasury, that candidates at certain competitive examinations which have been held during tiic course of the War have been informed,, with their Lordships&apos; authority, that in the event of their under-taking service in His Majesty&apos;s naval or military forces before appointment as the result of success in examination they will retain their right tc be at the end of such service appointed to the situ-ation they have earned.The number of candidates who enlisted before appointment is considerable, and although Open Competitive Examinations for male candidates cf or near military age have been generally suspended, examinations of Boy Clerk candidates for Assistant Clerkships con-tinue to be held and add to the number.     Scrutiny of all the cases has not been made and the question cf certification has arisen in a few only;   but it is certain that a proportion of these candidates will not satisfy the conditions of eligibility laid down in the Governments decisionOne/mch case is now before the Commissioners, the proposed appointment of Mr, T.S. Van&quot; Tell to a vacancy for an Assistant Clerk in the Inland Revenue Department, reported in June last.     Mr. Van Toll was successful in the Open Competition for Assistant Clerk-ships held in October 1914.     On the 25th of that month, before the result cf his examination was declared, he enlisted in the Army with permission cf the Inland Revenue Department in which he was serving as Boy Clerk.     He received the assuranoe cf appointment after histmilitary service which was specially authorised to be given to oan-didates at that competition by Treasury letter 20176/14 of let October 1914,     His case is now complete for certificatitn, but it is found that-his father was born in Holland.     If the candidate had not been serving in Macedonia the medical examination and other enquiries would have been completed and his certificate granted before the Government&apos;s decision was announced.     Under that decision he is ineligible for appointment during the War, and although his dis-qualification may thereafter he removed, his future, and the ful-filment of the promise made to nim, remain uncertain.
Besides the Open Competition cases there is another class in which a promise of appointment has &quot;been more or less explicitly, that is,, cases of men serving in unestablishod positions which lead in normal course to permanent appointment.One such case, that cf Herbert Keller, is now befere tho Commissioners cn -nomination for establishment as Postman.     The can-didate entered the Post Office service as Temporary Postman in 1914 after seven years&apos; -Army Service, and was recalled to the Colours on the outbreak of War.     It is probable that his father, Christian Keller, baker, was not a natural-born British subject;   ascertainment of the facts will take time as the candidate is with his regiment in France.In none of tho cases at present under notice- is immediate taking up of civil duty involved;   but certification and the assurance ofxjpointment on release from the Army, whether at the end of tho War or some earlier date, are a matter of importance to the candidates; and there is, besides, the official promise of appointment directly given or implied.The Commissioners think that those candidates are in a special position and submit them to their Lordships for such consideration as may be possible.     They do not think that excrotion need be made in respect of admission to Open Competitive Examination for fresh appointment, even where in ordinary course, there would be a priv-ileged claim for admission.     For example, although approved service as Boy Clerk has given cf oompeting for Assistant Clerkships, it does not seem necessary to allow to existing Boy Clerks ineligible under the new rule as to nationality admission, by way of exception to that rule, to future competitions for Assistant Clerkships if they have not previously had service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces,     They aro presumably being dismissed.The Commissioners suggest that there be added to tho rule con-tained in the Government&apos;s decision a proviso that exception may bo made in favour of persons in other respects duly qualified wlu, may become entitled, in ordinary course, by previous employment in a temporary capacity to appointment to permanent situations while serving or after having serv&amp;d in His Majesty&apos;b Forces,It is not proposed that the proviso should bo published, but should be communicated tc Departments for their guidance and, when necessary, to individual candidates enquiring as to their position,&quot;x x x xTreasury Chambers, October, 1918.3C .Jv X IJC&quot;In reply I am to inform you that. Ifiy Lords agree that the rules laid down in Treasury Letter of the 2nd instant (32948/18) should be qualified by the proviso that exception may bo made in favour of persons in other respects duly qualified who may become entitled, in ordinary course, by previous employment in a temporary capacity to appointment to permanent situations while serving or after having served in His Majesty&apos;e forces.     They note that it is not proposed that the proviso should bo published, but should be communicated to Departments for their guidance and, where necessary, to individual candidates enquiring as to their position.     It will be understood, however, that&apos; Departments will still be under the obligation of submitting to Lord Justice Bankcs&apos; Committee tho oases of all such persons at the time when it is proposed that they should actually take up duty in their Departments,&quot;x x x x x2 Fnitehall Gardens, S.1^1, October 26th, 1918.
