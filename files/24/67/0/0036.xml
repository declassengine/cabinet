 RQRET.MINISTRY  OF   FOOD.l^^iL^j^port for Week ending Wednesday, October 16, 1918.PART I-ACTION TAKEN.The King has been pleased to appoint Sir Alan Anderson, K.B.E., to be an additional member of the Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply.The Food Controller has learned with deep regret that Sir Henry Thompson is presumed to have perished in the sinking of the &quot; Leinster &quot; on Thursday, October 10. Sir Henry was Professor of Physiology in the University of Dublin, and had acted as Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Food since its inception. He was awarded a K.B.E. last January in recognition of his distinguished services, and his loss is felt acutely by the many friends whom he was always willing to assist.The Food Controller has assumed the chairmanship of the Joint Finance Board which has been established in order to secure unity of financial control in the matter of food supplies in accordance with the recommendations of the Select Committee on National Expenditure.The Food Council. Three meetings of the Council have been held during the week.. It was reported that Treasury sanction, had been asked for the setting up of 10 factories for the manufacture of potato flour.It was decided to submit to the Food Controller three alternatives as to the price of margarine : (a) reduce 2d. per lb. for three months certain; (b) reduce Id.per lb. for three months, with probable further reduction of Id. at end of period; (c) no alteration.   The Food Controller has, in fact, adopted the first suggestion.It was agreed that the policy of price fixing generally should be to maintain stability in such articles as meat and margarine for periods of at least three months, and so to arrange prices that control involved no loss but secured a small margin in hand.A note was presented on the question of Divisional Food Commissioners standing for Parliament and it was decided to prepare a memorandum to the War Cabinet on the matter.At the request of the Minister of Reconstruction it was agreed that Mr. Beveridge should attend a meeting called to consider the question of supplies of raw materials in the event of a cessation of hostilities. Major Astor suggested that it would be desirable for the Inter-Allied Food Council to consider the position as regards the supply of food to neutral and enemy countries in this event.It was decided not to allow the backs of coupon leaves to be used for commercial advertisements.The arrangements for administering the Cereals (Restriction) Order were stated to be satisfactory. From 1st September to 9th October, 23,423 quarters of damaged grain were released for feeding purposes. Nearly 5,000 applications were dealt with, and only 514 were rejected. It was resolved to instruct grain officers to facilitate the granting of licences and certificates to the utmost possible extent.Memoranda relating to bread finance were discussed. It was agreed that the nationalisation of the bakery trade was impracticable, and that the limitation of the subsidy to flour baked as loaves was inadvisable. It was decided to charge a higher price for flour used for proprietary breads and to push forward attempts at local centralisation of trade.Mr. Clynes stated that, in his opinion, sqme difficulties might be caused by an inquiry into profiteering on the lines suggested by Sir Albert Stanley. Working-class opinion would be stimulated to expect startling results and none would be forthcoming. The proper conduct of such an inquiry would, moreover, take an unconscionable time.Imports Board. The Board have considered (amongst other matters) the importa-tion of cheese, butter and cattle cake from the United States.A  (33)6638-3  Pk 1   H5  10/18  E&amp;S A.
In order to maintain the ration of butter and issues of cheese to the military and to civilians on the basis of 50 per cent, of the 1916 issue, the importation of 35,000 tons of cheese aud 21,000 tons of butter from U.S.A. in the cereal year is required The A merican Food Administration has been unable to supply this amount and prices are rising sharply. The Food &quot;Administration has requisitioned butter to the amount of 8,000 tons, but this has caused a rise in butter from&apos;47 cents to 62 cents per lb. Mr. Hoover lias offered to start a conservation campaign appealing to the United States population to save cheese and butter. It appears, however, that a result of this campaign in the present temper of the people would possibly mean that more butter and cheese would be thrown on the market than Avould be normally taken by the Allies, and he asks that we should guarantee to take amounts up to 40,000 tons further butter and 50,000 tons of. cheese, and that.we should take these amounts at prices fixed by the Food Administration. The Ministry of Food have been unable to accept this proposal, and have suggested that the prices should be limited to the prices ruling at the recent rise, i.e., 47 cents for butter and 25 cents for cheese. Mr. Hoover there-upon agreed to settle a price in advance, viz., 53 cents for buiter and 28 ce-nts for cheese.   To this the Board have agreed and have asked for Treasury sanction.With regard to cattle cake, the purchase of 140,000 tons of linseed and cotton cake from the United States has been approved, and Treasury credits have been obtained. There appears to be, however, some reluctance on the part of the American Food Administration to agree to the export of this quantity of cattle food at the present.The United States Food Administration have asked to be supplied with statistics giving the number of dairy herds in the United Kingdom-this information has been supplied. The proposed importation of cattle food is intended entirely for the use of dairy cattle and milk production.Home Supplies Board-On Thursday, October 10, Mr. Wells reported that the position as regards feeding-stuffs was even more serious than had been supposed, owing to the United States authorities having cabled that tliey would be unable to export any cake for cattle to the United Kingdom. Mr. Wise stated that an urgent cable had been despatched in reply, and that he was preparing a statement for the American delegate on the Committee of Representatives showing the necessity for obtaining concentrates. Sir Walter Roffey reported that the position was the same in the case of maize. He had received information that none would be exported from America. It was agreed that after Mr. Wise had communicated with the American delegate, the question should be further considered, with a view to obtaining the co-operation of the Board of Agriculture for requesting action by the War Cabinet.Mr. Wells further reported on the steps being taken and proposed in connection with the preservation, of fat stock.Experiments in freezing and chilling pointed to the possibility of keeping beef chilled for two or three weeks. It was hoped by this means to arrange that supplies of chilled beef would be available for a few weeks after the normal supply of fresh beef would be getting short. There would be no difficulty about freezing mutton. With regard to the proposed increase of price for first-grade cattle. Mr. Wells reported that the details of the scheme had not been fully worked out, but that it vras hoped to increase the price as from the middle of December, by a sliding scale, rising until the following June. The scheme was discussed, and it was agreed that, subject to Treasury sanction being obtained, it should be adopted.On Monday, October 14, the administration of the Cereals (Restriction) Order was discussed, and a report to the Food Council agreed upon. With respect to a complaint that farmers have been compelled to let the millers have grain which has afterwards been returned as meal at an enhanced price, it was reported that arrange-ments are being made to fix prices and prevent profiteering in these meals. It was generally agreed that the announced policy should be followed of bringing damaged and tail grain into account, ton for ton in offals, and at some increased rate for every ton of cake.Joint Finance Board. The first meeting of this Board was held at Trafalgar House on Wednesday, October 2. The question of a staff for the Committee of Representatives was considered, and it was decided that the extra cost involved, estimated at 12,0001. per annum, should be charged to the Committee of Represen-tatives and, according to the decision of the &quot;Food Controllers, would be borne by the four countries in equal shares.   It was further decided that the amount should
be borne on the books of the Ministry of Food, subject to repayment by the other countries of their shares.At a further meeting on Monday, October 14, Sir A. Stanley&apos;s recommendation for an impartial enquiry into trade proiits was considered. It was decided that the Ministry of Food, the Sugar and Wheat Commissions should each make enquiry and report to Joint Finance Board, whether the proiits of any business under their several Departments were such as to require special investigation, or explanation, and that Mr. Peat should get from Board of Inland Revenue returns of excess profits paid by various trades.Committee of Representatives.-ThQ Food Programme of Importation for the four months ending 31st December 1918 has been settled. The Committee are now considering a detailed programme for the first three months of 1919.Central Agricultural Advisory Council. At a meeting of the Council, held on October 15th, means of dealing with the large numbers of fat cattle now being sent to market were discussed, and it was stated that a certain quantity of mutton and beef was being placed in cold storage, though the limited capacity of the freezing plant in this country, and the shortage of skilled slaughtermen, made it difficult to deal with large quantities ; the Army is also taking supplies of fresh instead of frozen meat. It was recommended that all markets should at once be opened for fat cattle, and all cattle accepted as fit for killing should at once be graded, weighed and paid for, and if sent back for more than one week, their keep beyond that period should be paid for by the Ministry of Food. On behalf of the Ministry, it was stated that no guarantee had been given that all cattle sent into the Fat Stock Markets would be taken.A motion was carried stating that it was the opinion of the Council that it would be highly inexpedient, in the interests of food production to prohibit or restrict the sale of unthreshed oats. A motion was also passed that all corn fit for human food should be taken at maximum prices ; any corn that is not so taken to be allowed to the farmer to deal with as he thinks fit.Consumers&apos; Council. At the meeting of this Council held on 16th October it was announced that Mr. A. B. Weir and Mr. J. Young had been appointed to succeed Mr. Stewart and Mr. Gallacher. Mr. dynes welcomed Mr. Weir as a member, and thought the Council would agree that if he was able to give the attention to all questions that his predecessor had done the Council would be well served.He stated that it had been found necessary to raise the price of home-produced butter from 2s. 4d. to 2s. M. a pound, but the quantity affected would be com-paratively small, while at the same time margarine, which formed the by far larger proportion of the fat ration, would almost certainly be reduced by twopence a pound. He was not absolutely certain, but he thought the way was clear for that reduction ; and that would more than counterbalance the addition to the price of home butter. There was a certain reserve formed on the sales of margarine, which it was desired to give the public the benefit of. But in that event, the public would have to be informed that any rise in the price of raw materials might cause the price of margarine to be again raised in the future. He pointed out that in the event of an end of the war being reached in the next few months, Germany and Austria  especially Austria were so situated with regard to food that if they entered into competition with us in the markets of the world they would be prepared to pay almost famine prices, and thus cause a considerable increase against us.A resolution of condolence with the relatives of Sir Henry Thompson was unanimously carried.Meat.-The most important factor in the situation during the week has been the surplus of cattle sent to market.The following steps have been taken to deal with the position :-(1) As from the 4th October and until further notice only cattle really fit for slaughter will be accepted in grading markets. All surplus cattle not yielding the full percentage of meat which they are capable of producing are refused, while the general effect of this is that only first grade stock
are accepted. For the time being instructions have been given that care should be taken not to turn back cattle which clearly cannot improve with further feeding. This has resulted in the turning back of a very large number of heavy fed cattle.(2) Steps have been taken to supply only home-killed meat to civilians, and to restrict to the smallest possible dimensions the output of frozen meat. Such frozen meat as is being released from store at present is ill-conditioned meat (in many instances damaged by torpedo or otherwise during ocean transit) which, if left in store, would become entirely unfit for food and be condemned.(3) Arrangements are being made whereby the issue of frozen meat and other produce to the British and American armies in this country will cease as rapidly as possible.(4) The available plant and skilled labour for freezing and chilling meat is being utilised to the utmost, but the resources of the country in both respects are limited.(5) Neither the material, the plant, nor the skilled labour necessary are available for canning, salting, or preserving on any large scale.Dried Fruits.-Further shipments have been made of the Californian and Indian sultanas purchased on behalf of this Ministry.The Greek Government have not yet been able to provide any further ships for the export of currants from Greece, but at an interview at this Ministry the Greek Minister stated that he would see M. Venizelos, who is now in this country, in order to ascertain whether any further facilities could ba given.The anticipated stocks of dried fruits on November 1st should amount to 10,000 tons, and the trade have recommended that a distribution should be made in the first week of November in order to meet the Christmas trade. Investigations are being made as to whether it is possible to arrange a satisfactory distribution for this purpose.Offers have been made to the date importing firms for the piirchase of 36,000 tons of Persian dates on behalf of the War Office (22,000 tons), Ministry of Food (12,000 tons), and the N.A.C.B. (2,000 tons).Divisional Repohts.North Midland. In the past fortnight 112,199 lbs. prime fish are reported to have been caught at Grimsby, where a distribution scheme has recently been set in motion which it is thought will greatly facilitate equal distribution.Home Counties- The hop-picking season in.Kent has been brought to a close, and the arrangements made to provide supplies for the pickers, and assistance to the retailers, are said to.have proved entirely satisfactory, a fact which reflects credit on all concerned in the handling of a difficult and at one time even threatening situation.North Wales. -It is feared that owing to the recent rains not more than 50 per cent, of what promised to be a record grain crop, will be fit for human consumption.General. The Potato Control Committees have now been set up in most of the divisions, in connection with the Ministry&apos;s Control Scheme, and are reported to be beginning operations.Orders under Defence of the Realm Regulations.(1) The Cocoa Powder (No. 2) Order, 1918, dated 10th October, 1918, revokes the Cocoa Powder Order, 1918, but substantially re-enacts it with amendments. The principal amendment is that on sales by manufacturers to wholesalers, who declare that they are buying for the purpose of re-sale by wholesale, the maximum price is lowered, thus providing for the wholesalers&apos; profit. Manufacturers and wholesalers&apos; prices include delivery to the buyers&apos; premises. The maximum price of cocoa bean shell is fixed.(2) The Milk (Registration of Dealers) Amendment Order, 1918, dated 14th October, 1918, gives power to Food Committees to revoke in certain circumstances certificates of registration issued by them, if they are satisfied that the premises
concerned are unsuitable for the sale of milk, or are insanitary, or if the holder of the certificate or his agents have infringed any sanitary regulation, or failed to take proper steps to prevent waste or the spread of disease.(3) The Vegetarian Butter and Vegetarian Lard (Maximum Prices) Order, 1918, dated 14th October, 1918, fixes maximum prices for butters and lards manufactured wholly from, vegetable oils and fats. The prices are fixed, (I)&apos;ex works; (2) as delivered to retailer, i.e., with addition of all transport charges ; (3) retail price inclusive of packing. The Order also fixes a standard composition for vegetable butter and vegetable lard.Enforcement of Orders.The total of prosecutions for the past week is rather less than that for the ^previous week.   The summary is as follows : Prosecutions. Convictions.769 696In four Divisions the percentage of convictions was 100, but in each case the number of prosecutions was under 12. All but one of the 31 Scottish cases resulted in convictions.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.Imports.Imports of the principal food-stuffs in the week ended 12th October (190,200 tons)-were higher than those of the preceding week (177,200 tons) or than the average of the first 41 weeks of the year (180,600 tons) (Table A), but the total for the first six weeks of the cereal year (1,052,000 tons) is still 81,000 tons below that of the corresponding period of last year (1,133,000 tons).The outstanding feature of &apos;this week&apos;s imports is the very large import of sugar (64,000 tons), which is the highest recorded in any week during the last two years with the one exception of the weekended 6th April 1918 (66,300 tons). There were, substantial increases in tea (3,700 tons increase), cocoa (1,800 tons increase) and coffee (900 tons increase), the import of cocoa being exceptionally good. Condensed milk again showed a high rate of import (3,880 tons). The principal decreases were in bacon (which fell from 13,300 tons to 3,400 tons), beef (which fell from 7,900 tons to 1,700 tons), and lard (which fell from 3,700 tons to 2,050 tons). Wheat and flour as grain fell from 85,300 tons to 79,400 tons, and there was no improvement in barley, oats, and maize combined.The monthly figures of imports of oilseeds show a decrease in September compared with August under each important head.The total imports for the first six weeks of the cereal years 1917-18 and 1918-19 are compared in the following table: Imports (first 6 weefis of cereal year).. -  -	1917.	1918.

Consumption.Tables. The statistics illustrating consumption have been revised and are now given in two groups relating, respectively, to quantities and to index numbers. Table B (1) gives estimates of recent consumption of the chief food-stuffs in the United Kingdom. The quantities are those passing into distributors&apos; hands for consumption and as a measure of actual consumption in the case of the less perishable articles such as flour, bacon, lard, sugar and tea, are subject to modification according to changes in retailers&apos; stocks. Table B (2) illustrates recent changes in the slaughter of live stock in Great Britain, the returns covering about 70 per cent, of the estimated total slaughter. . Under Table C is given a group of index numbers illustrating changes in the rate of consumption of various articles over a longer period. Except in the case of milk, the standard taken is the rate of consumption in May 1917, so that the varying degrees in which the consumption of different articles has changed can be readily ascertained.Meat. The numbers of animals accepted for slaughter at markets in Great Britain in the week ended 5th October are estimated at 47,000 cattle and 208,000 sheep, as compared with 55,000 cattle and 204,000 sheep in the preceding week, and 56,000 cattle and 254,000 sheep in the corresponding week of 1917. These numbers measure the degree of success attending the Ministry^ efforts to hold back stock in the face of a prospective feeding-stuffs position much more acute than existed last winter. The estimated supply of home-fed butcher&apos;s meat of all kinds was 17,700 tons, and the issue of refrigerated meat remained at the minimum already suggested, viz., 1,100 tons, thus giving an estimated total consumption of 18,800 tons as against 20,500 tons in the preceding week. This indicates that the enforcement of the lower ration is now proceeding more satisfactorily. The weekly rate of consumption a year ago was 25,000 tons.Fish. Supplies of fish at Billingsgate and at several large provincial markets were 4,431 tons as compared with a weekly average of 3,297 tons for September. Supplies at Billingsgate alone were 2,770 tons as against 1,945 tons in the corres-jDonding week of 1917.Stocks.Stocks of beef have been enlarged by 2,000 tons ; other meats, including canned, by 5,000 tons, and cheese by 2,100 tons, while the stocks of bacon have been reduced by 4,100 tons, and butter 1,800 tons. Stocks of condensed milk have risen by 5,700 tons, and now stand at 46,100 tons.
