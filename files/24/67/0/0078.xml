[This Document is the Property ,of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed fur the War Cabinet.   October 11)18.I CONFIDENTIAL,   j ,G.T.-6078.IN pursuance of the undertaking given to the Cabinet on the 13th August ot this year, I circulate the annexed memorandum on the question of Japanese claims to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator. From it the following conclusions may be drawn: &apos;(1.) The Governments of Australia and New Zealand were fully informed in March 1915 of the claims of the Japanese Government to the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, and of the attitude of His Majesty Government, which was that all acquisitions of German possessions in the Pacific must be held over for discussion in the final peace negotiations.(2.) In the&apos; preliminary negotiations in 1916 concerning the adhesion of the Commonwealth Government to the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Mr. Hughes defining Australia^ requirements as regards coastwise trade to Sir E. Grey, and subsequently in conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, assumed that Australia would retain the German islands south of the Equator, and that Japan would retain those north of that line.(3.) In 1917, when the Japanese Government were being pressed to accede to the Admiralty&apos;s appeal for additional naval assistance, the Governments of the Commonwealth and New Zealand were consulted, and their assent obtained, before the assurance respecting the Pacific Islands north of the Equator was given to the Japanese Government.r c.y   Foreign Office, October 15, 1918.^-----The memorandum on the Japanese occupation of the Pacific Islands of the 22nd December, 1915, gives the history of their occupation and the origin of the Japanese claims to the retention of the islands north of the Equator. Without recapitulating the contents of that memorandum, it may be recalled that Sir E. Grey informed 12 Viscount (then Baron) Ishii, in a conversation at the end of August 1915, that we were bound by agreement to enter no such engagements and that all occupations of territory must consequently be provisional till the end of the war.In February and March 1915, in order to allay uneasiness in the minds of the Ministers of the Commonwealth Government, lest His Majesty&apos;s Government should have come to a secret agreement with the Japanese Government relative to the eventual disposal of the islands north of the Equator in Japanese occupation, Mr. Harcourt, by permission of Sir E. Grey, transmitted in secret despatches to the Governor-General of Australia and the Governor of New Zealand copies of the essential telegrams containing communications on the subject between the British and Japanese Governments, together with an assurance that no other communication, verbal or written had passed, of a nature to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government. This correspondence showed that, while the Japanese held strong views as to their claims, His Majesty&apos;s Government refused to admit them, and insisted that all territory taken from the Germans in the Pacific by the Japanese or British forces was to remain open for discussion in the terms of peace on the conclusion of the war. On the 19th March M r. Harcourt transmitted to the Dominion Governments a further memorandum of the whole of the communications which had passed between the British and Japanese Governments on the subject.Viscount Ishii, in February ,1916, replying to an interpellation, said that with -li regard to the disposal of the islands it was necessary to await the peace negotiations.Early in 1916 the Commonwealth Government was consulted with regard to a ?, demand of the Japanese Government for the adhesion of Australia to the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, and replied that the Prime Minister would consult His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject on his approaching visit to England.   Sir E. Grey[887] B
56401/16.   informed the Japanese Ambassador on the 22nd March, after consultation with tl Commonwealth Prime Minister, of the basis on which Australia would be willing negotiate for the adhesion of Australia to the Commercial Treaty.   The points discuss with Mr. Hughes related to immigration, tariff and coastwise trade.   The latter was t be reserved to Australia and was to include trade between Australia and any thin south of the Equator   which is now, or may hereafter become British territory.&quot; was pointed out that Australia had special regulations for coastwise trade, in some cas excluding even British vessels,   Japan reserved her coastwise trade and wouli doubtless treat as coastwise trade, trade with any territory acquired by her north of th92475/16. Equator. In a further conversation with the Japanese Ambassador on the 1.1th Ma Sir E. Grey informed his Excellency that Australia wished to define coastwise tradi as including &quot; all islands in the Pacific which are now or may hereafter be in Britisj possession.&quot; It had been pointed out to Mr. Hughes that Japan was now in occupatio; of islands north of the Equator and that she would certainly claim that, if Australi defined coastwise trade as she desired, Japan would also be entitled to define it in hti case as including any islands which are now or may hereafter be in her possession in tli Pacific.   Mr. Hughes had given Sir E. Grey to understand that be thought there wou113542/16. be no objection to this definition. In a conversation between Mr. Hughes and tl Japanese Ambassador on the 9th June about the adhesion of Australia to the Angl Japanese Commercial Treaty passing allusion was made to this question of coastwi^ trade. Mr. Hughes said that the existing Australian rule could not be altered and th even Great Britain had to conform thereto. The Japanese Ambassador assented anj finally suggested that these negotiations be resumed on Mr. Hughes&apos; return to Austral . with the Japanese consul-general..26707/17. On the 2nd February the Japanese Ambassador communicated a memorandapurporting to be a resume of the position adopted by Lord Grey with regard to&apos;Japan claims to German concessions in China and the German South Sea Islands.   As regan the latter the memorandum referred to the view of Lord Grey that all occupation of territory belonging to Germany by the Japanese and British forces would be withoil prejudice to the rmal arrangement at the conclusion of peace, and declared that in vie&quot; of the very extensive operations in which the Japanese navy had been and wi still engaged  in co-operation with the British navy the Japanese nation wou naturally insist upon  the permanent retention of all German islands north the Equator, and the Japanese Government would have to rely on the suppoj of the British Government to that end at the proper time.   The position of tl Japanese Government had been fully explained to Lord Grey by Viscount 1st during his visit to London in 1915.   The memorandum then referred to the questi of coastwise trade discussed with Mr. Hughes in connection with the establishmei of treaty relations with Australia,     Mr. Hughes had said that one of Australifj preliminary conditions was that Japan should not demand the right of coastwise tra in Australia.   Defining the sphere of coastwise trade Mr. Hughes had stated th under the assumption that the German islands now under the occupation of t Australian forces should become the possessions of the Commonwealth at the -end the war, the sphere in question would include the trade between those islands and tl Australian ports.   Lord Grey had observed that, in that case, acting upon a simi assumption, Japan might make a claim of a similar nature in regard to the traj between Japan and the German islands north of the Equator, now occupied by her. which view Mr. Hughes had acquiesced (conversation of Lord Grgyand Marquis Inoui 22nd March, 1916).   In a later conference with Lord Grey ou the 9th May, 191 Mr. Hughes had again raised this question and renewed his desire that the Japan Government should accept his point of view, whereupon Lord Grey had repeated previous observations, and had pointed out the necessity of recognising a similar posit] for Japan in the islands north of the Equator.   Mr. Hughes had answered that course suggested by his Lordship was quite fair and equitable, and that he had him no objection thereto.20396/16. Early in February 1916 the Admiralty asked that an application be made toJapanese Cavernment for the assistance of a flotilla of Japanese destroyers in24943/16.    Mediterranean, and a few days later, on the appearance of the German commorj raider &quot; Moewe,&quot; amplified the request by one for a Japanese cruiser squadron in Indian Ocean, and for another force of destroyers to patrol the Malacca Straits.   T30818/10.    Japanese Minister said it would greatly assist his Cabinet in considering these requesj36950/16. if he coidd point to some encouragement on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government their hope of improved treatment of Japanese in Australia and Canada hy the adherer of these Governments to the treaty of commerce, and of allowing Japanese doctors
practise in the Straits Settlements.   The matter was referred to the Colonial Office, stress being laid on the urgency of the need for naval assistance, and the desirability of holding out some hope of the fulfilment of the Japanese wishes.   Commenting on the Japanese reply, the jLdmiralty observed that the assistance of the Japanese navy had 34976/16.; been most valuable in the past, and its effect must have been appreciated in Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.   The Japanese Government and public regarded those services as compensated by the provisional occupation of the German islands north of the Equator, to which they doubtless intended to lay claim at the post helium settlement. The cruisers for the Indian Ocean and destroyers for the Malacca Straits were granted 05807/16. early in &quot;April.   Trie Admiralty requested in December 1916 that two of the four 256472/16. Japanese cruisers at Singapore be sent to the Cape to operate against raiders in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and renewed their request for destroyers in the Mediter-ranean, which had been allowed to drop.   The Admiralty asked that, if the Japanese Government showed reluctance, it should be strongly pressed.   Sir C. Greene pressed 16546/17. the Japanese Government for compliance, but warned His Majesty&apos;s Government that some demand for compensation was to be expected as on former occasions.On the 27th January, 1917, Sir C. Greene transmitted a message of the Japanese 22099/17. Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that the Japanese Government desired to approach His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to obtaining an assurance of their willingness to support Japan&apos;s claims respecting the disposal of Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung and possessions in the islands north of the Equator at a future Peace Conference. The Allies&apos; assent to the eventual occupation of Constantinople by Russia had recently beeli published, and a special agreement had been signed in connection with the entry of Italy into the war. The Japanese Government therefore hoped they might now receive tile desired assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government. On its receipt they proposed to approach the French and Russian Governments with a similar request. The Japanese Ambassador confirmed this message in conversation with Mr. Balfour on the 2nd 27983/17. February.Referring to our request made in 191G for additional naval assistance, the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs told His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that it would be easier for him to overcome the objections of the Japanese Cabinet and Naval General Staff if he eould quote the willingness of His Majesty&apos;s Government to give the assurance now. His own position would also be strengthened to the advantage of Allied interests. Sir C. Greene was in favour of making a virtue of necessity and giving the assurance. He pointed out that Japan was in actual possession, and if she eventually declined to surrender the islands it would be necessary either to expel her or offer other compensation, possibly more onerous, than acquiescence now. The Japanese public expected a reward for their participation in the war, and the reversion of the German Islands would go far to satisfy their ambition. As regards naval assistance it would make all the difference whether they granted it in response to a friendly action, or merely as a transaction on a pecuniary basis. Sir C. Greene imagined they would hardly insist on money payment if the assurance were given, and suggested it might be accompanied by the expression of a hope that acquiescence might lead to the whole-hearted participation of Japan in the new and wider field of co-operation.Mr. Long communicated this message by telegram to the Governments of the 215917/17. Commonwealth and New Zealand on the 1st and 2nd February, explaining that His 26918/17. Majesty&apos;s Government was very unwilling to give any pledgee to Japan before the peace negotiations, and doubted whether they were justified in so doing without obtaining the consent of their Allies, but that the Admiralty were pressing for immediate additional naval assistance from Japan in the South Atlantic and Mediterranean. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore desired to be in a position to give some (undertaking showing their willingness to meet the wishes of Japan as regards the islands north of the Equator. It would be practically impossible to induce Japan to surrender them. Nothing would in fact be given up by the recognition of her claims. The acquiescence of the Dominion Ministers was therefore asked in the event of His Majesty&apos;s Government being unable to avoid giving some pledge to Japan before the Peace Conference., In any case no assurance would be given without a corresponding assurance from Japan as to our retention of the German Pacific colonies south of the Equator. In his telegram to the Governor of New Zealand Mr. Long added that Mr. Massey had seen it and expressed a favourable opinion.On the 2nd February Sir C. Greene reported that the Japanese Government had 27203/17. acceded to our request for naval assistance, arid hoped that His Majes&apos;ty&apos;s Government would take their action into favourable consideration in considering the question of granting the desired assurance concerning the disposal of Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung\
and the South Sea Islands. They, however, no longer associated their desire for an assurance with that of naval assistance. In thanking the Japanese Government for their compliance His Majesty&apos;s Government said that they were obliged to consult certain of the29366/17. Dominions as regards the desired assurance. The reply of the Japanese Government granting naval assistance was communicated by Mr. Long to the Governor-General of Australia and the Governor of New Zealand by telegraph on the 5th February. Mr. Long said that in considering the request of the Japanese Government for an assurance he wished to add the following considerations to those previously submitted to the two Dominion Governments. Apart from useful naval assistance to the Admiralty, the Japanese Government had rendered great service in supplying&apos;guns and munitions to ourselves and the Russians. Besides the importance we attached to the continuance of this help, there was the fact that Germany had been making, and was&apos; still making, efforts to detach Japan from the Allies, and it was necessary to frustrate this policy. Any answer which could be interpreted as unfavourable to the aspirations of Japan would inevitahly react on their general attitude and have an unfortunate effect on the general course of the war.30566/17. The Governor of New Zealand replied on the 6th February that his Governmentagreed with the views expressed by Mr. Massey.30905/17. On the 7th February the Governor-General of Australia transmitted the reply ofthe Commonwealth Government to Mr. Long&apos;s telegrams of the Lst and 5th February as follows: &quot; When in England the Prime Minister had several conversations with the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Ambassador on the subject. The Australian Government quite realised the delicacy and importance of the question. As explained by the Prime Minister in London, the attitude of Australia was, broadly speaking, that she would not object to Japan&apos;s occupancy of the Pacific Islands north of the Equator, except one or two small ones on or near the line, of which Nauru and Ocean Island were typical. The Commonwealth Government would carefully abstain from saying or doing anything likely to strain the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with Japan, either in regard to the future partition of the Pacific or trade. In the event of the Prime Minister attending the War Conference he would represent the views of the Commonwealth at length.&quot;32459/1-32268/1;32599/17. Mr. Long replied on the 8th asking whether, if His Majesty&apos;s Government found itimpossible to defer the question until the Conference, he could take it that the Commonwealth Government agreed to His Majestys Government giving Japan some such pledge as was referred to in his telegram of 1st February, and asking to what islands north of the Equator the Prime Minister referred as being exceptions from the general iule. The Prime Minister answered on the 10th that there was no objection to giving some such pledge to the Japanese Government, and added that he did not know the names of any islands.slightly north of the Equator, Nauru and Ocean Islands being slightly south of it.   ^Ocean Islands are British possessions.)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo reported on 9th February that when the French Ambassador had urged on the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs the importance of Japan supporting American advice to China, to sever relations with Germany, the latter had said that his position in recommending such a course to his Cabinet would be strengthened, and it would be easier to appease the opposition, who had supported the China policy of the late Government, if he could obtain from the Freiich Government, as well as from the British and Russian Governments, an assurance as regards the disposal of Germanys rights in Shantung and the Pacific Islands. The French Embassy referred to this request in a memorandum of 11th February, and stated that M. Bnand was m favour of acceding thereto. 36133/17. On 14th February Mr. Balfour informed the Japanese Ambassador that HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo had been instructed to make to the Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs, a statement in the following terms : His Majesty&apos;s Government accede with pleasure to the request of the Japanese Government for an assurance that they will support Japan*s claims in regard to the disposal of Germany&apos;s rights in Shantung and in possessions in islands north of the Equator, on the occasion of a Peace Conference, it being understood that the Japanese Government will, in the eventual peace settlement, treat in the same spirit Great Britain&apos;s claims to the German islands south of the Equator.&quot;
noMr. Balfour at the same time informed the Japanese Ambassador that he felt it necessary to inform our Allies, France, Russia, and Italy, signatories of the Pact of London, immediately that this assurance had been given to the Japanese Government. These embassies were accordingly informed on 17th February.The official note of the Japanese Government acknowledging the above assurance, 40197/17-stated that the Imperial Government were highly gratified at this fresh proof of the solid relations of amity which unite the two countries, and declared that the Japanese Government will have no hesitation in supporting the claims .of His  Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the German islands south of the Equator.The texts of the assurance and of the .reply of the Japanese Government were communicated to the Colonial Office on the 23rd February.In August 1917 the assurance was also communicated confidentially to the State Department of the United States Government in compliance with its request for information with regard to Japanese intentions in the Pacific, and in particular as to whether any. understanding existed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Japanese Government for an ultimate settlement there.o4
