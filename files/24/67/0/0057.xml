JOTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BKITAliJC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT).jrSORET.     I WAR CABINET.0..T.6O57.       POST-WAR NAVAL AMD MILIT RY REQUIREMENTS.Position of Private Armament FirmsCopy of letter from Chairman. Coventry po Secretary.iWar Cabinet.Ordnance WorksThe Secretary,War Cabinet.Sir,THE COVENTRY ORDNANCE WORKS LIMITED. 3, Central Buildings, Westminster,London S.W.1. 14th October, 1918.The question of the future of the Coventry Ordnance Works after the y&apos;ar has for long engaged.the olose attention of the directors, and they recognize fully the importance of working out a definite scheme beforehand to be put into operation as soon as peace is declared. .At the same time, seeing that the Company has always been engaged almost exclusively upon armament work both Naval and Military-it is difficult for the Directors to -formulate any reconstruction programme until they know what the policy of the Government is in regard to private armament firms.Hitherto we have failed completely to elicit any information whatever on this subject from any of the Government&apos; Departments concerned, and in consequence hutebeen seriously handicapped in making our plans whereas In the national interest we might reasonably have exnected assistance.*We are told, in effect, that there is no Government policy in regard to private armament factories after the war, and are unable to ascertain that any practical steps are being taken to formulate one.   In fact the prevailing Impression in official circles appears to be that the problem is full pf difficulty and that nothing can be done now because nobody knows what the future will bring forth.Everybody knows one thing, however, and. that Is that if this problem is shirked now because it Is difficult we shay, be landed in a hopeless and disastrous muddle.-..ny working hypothesis is better than none, and to do nothing for fear of making a mistake is the worst form of mistake.
I have the honour to request therefore that this mattesJ brought to the notice of the War Cabinet because it is of vital importance that the transition from war to peace conditions shallJ effected, as smoothly and quickly as possible and this can only bo I done if problems are thought out in advance * IfI would venture to suggest, therefore, that a Commltte -I appointed with a member of the Cabinet as-Chairman, leading repreJr sentatives of the Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions and War Office! and certain non-official members, with a wide term of reference im enquire into the probable Naval and Military requirements of this 1 country under peace conditions and the manner in which they shoull; be satisfied.I am aware that no finality can be reached now on this I difficult problem and that any conclusions will require continual! readjustment to meet the everchanging circumstances of the times.! But it is surely possible to lay down some working hypothesis for! the immediate future on which we can act and towards which we can! shape our plans . 1I have the honour to beYour obedient Servant. (SB.) W.L.HICHENS. CHAIRMAN.
