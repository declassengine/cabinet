(a).2*    Our experience   in fighting and in wastage allows us to make the*following forecast of Xosses:-Oct.24 - 31 November December 1919January &quot;ebruary March April May JunePrance &amp; Italy,Other Theatres,* *16,000 68,240 63.610Total42,980 39,830 30,345 58,17040,810 49,470%297irT&apos;The wastage in other theatres is made up by the substitution of Indian for British personnel wherever possible, and the addition of now Indian battalions instead of the depleted white ones.3.    The a&quot;bnve losses include estimated transfer to Aviation Service, Tank Corns, etc, amounting to 5*,750 hut do not include the Army quota of the 33,000 Category &quot;A&quot; miners ?ahich under recent War Cabinet decision have to be released from the Forces,(&amp;)   The dlfifioienoy of 43.000 is mado up as follows:-Surplus, Deficiency;.-. &quot;^437600*.        - 20,000Prance Macedonia EgyptMesopotamiaIndiaItaly* t* 04,000 6,000 9,000 2,000
r) It?4,     we arrive therefore up to July 1st, 1919, at a total wastage of infantry of 472,155 (h).5,    To meet this we have the following:-(i)    &quot;A&quot; men &quot;by abolition ofHome Defence.......      20^,000(ii)   Estimated saving by reduc-tion in roarward services in France   ..     ..     ..   ..        5,000(iii)    &quot;A&quot; men now under trainingat Home       .. ..    ..     165,000(iv)   Estimated drafts,October 24-31 ......      12,000(v)   Returned wounded up to1st July, 1919......      72,000(vi)   New recruits from M.N.S. (150,000) Of whom only 10,000 will be 19 yrs. of age on or before 1st July,.      10,000 (vli)   Assets from other arms 17,000,,&quot;&quot;301,000Our only remaining asset is the substitution of Indians where possible for white&apos; troops, and these have, already been taken into account in Column 3 of Para, 2,.6.     On 1st July, 1919, our total deficit will therefore amount to 171,155, on the standard of 46 &quot;A&quot;   Divisions at 900 per En, War Establishment.7.     Thus it will be seen that our fighting strength in infantry will steadily decrease and with ever-increasing rapidity.   The greater strain thus thrown on those remaining makes for a lower standard in discipline, training, and consequently morale; which are all factors productive of a higher percentage of wastage than would obtain in normal circumstances.8.     The Army Council view this state of affairs with grave concern and are considering hew on the one hand economies can be effected and; on the ^ther, what new sources of supply can be tapped0   Hitherto they had hoped to have secured a oertain measure of relief by inducing the French and Belgian Armies to undertake certain obligations in respect of rearward cervices in France and Flanders now maintained by the British Army^ but it was made clear at the Conference attended by representatives of G-JI^Q, two days age that there Is nothing to be obtained from this source.   As eur Armies advance our transportation problem increases and the lack of railway personnel * especially engine driversf is becoming more serious daiiy.   Consequently we are putting forward a proposal to the War Cabinet to ask for 10,000American(b). Made up as follows:-bosses by transfer and wastage (para.2) 429,15*. Present shortage (footnote (a)) ,,     ..      43,000
9 H *1ft J fiAmerican railway personnel to be placed at the disposal of our Railway Operating Department for the purpose and it is hoped that this rcqueot may, in return for the many services rendered to the American Army, be favourably receivedc9*     The only other source from which any large number of additional men oan be drawn is Ireland,   The experience of the last six months has proved that, with every inducement that can be held out, nothing much oan be expected from that country under the system of voluntary enlistment.,   On the other hand; the number of able-bodied   young men trho could be obtained by conscription is very large,-   Estimates vary greatly and, having regard to the exceptional circumstances of the case, it is impossible to make an accurate forecast, but the Army Council ate convinced that, v/hen every allowance iB made for special Irish conditions, at least 150,000 good men (leas than half the number which, according to the British standard, Ireland ought still to furnish) could be thus raised-   They have no fear that the enforcement of conscription io beyond the power of the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland; or that the vast majority of the men oonscripted v/ould prove other than good and loyal soldiers,10o     The question of oonscription in Ireland involves political considerations which lie quite outside the province of the Army Council, but the Council beg respectfully to point out that it is essential to the proper discharge of their own duties that they should be informed as soon as possible whether the Government intend to proceed with oonscription in Ireland or not,   Questions of the greatest urgency as to the future conduct of the war cannot be decided, or even considered, a3 long as the Council are left in uncertainty whether theyca,n count on the very substantial addition to the strength of the Army, which conscription applied to Ireland would provide.   The number of divisions to be maintained in future, the extent of Front we can afford to hold; the arrangements for resting and training our troops during the winter, and many other pressing matters cannot be dealt with until the Council know approximately what is the number of men, of which they are likely to be able to dispose in the future0   It will be apparent from what has been already said, that in making any calculation on that point, the question whether Ireland is or is not to be regarded as a source of supply, is of most material importance,MILNER.24th Ootober, 1918,
