HiaTfttaOocumjnt ,8 the Proper^&apos; 17^ &apos;/DEMOBILISATION CP MUNITION INDUSTRIES^flwant 2 3 2^,V:V   In G.TU 6041, tho Minister of Munitions postulates ,, j^^lternativ^s in regard to the future of his Department. -Vj^the first case, the elimination of the Department and the assumption of Its functions by the consuming Services.     In the second, its amplification into a Ministry of National Supply to provide for the materiel requirements of the Navy, Army, Air Porce and otner Government departments. I presume ho means all other&quot;Spvornmont departments, in fact, the centralisation of all Government purchasing.In this connection it is interesting to reflect that during the war the Government in its different Departments has purchased a very large part of the entire industrial production of the country.The reasons underlying a ,proposal to concentrate purchase in one Department are probably as follows(a) Prevention of competition between departments, and consolidation of inspection thus&quot; securing economy and efficiency of production.(b) The possibilities of standardisation also involving eoonomy and efficiency of production.These two reasons would apply both in peace and war, but in future war I presume the following reason would also apply -(g)   A single control of the allocation of industrial strength and allocation of industrial resources to the specified needs laid down by a central war authority or staff.     This will secure an accurate apportionment of industrial strength to Navy, Army and Air Porce in accordance with the character of total war effort.With regard to (a) and (b), I have the conviction that tho competition and lack of co-ordination between t&amp;e branches of such a huge organisation would bo fraught with equal difficulties to&quot;the present system.With regard to (c), I believe it is now clear that the creation of an Imperial War Staff directing the policy of war effort would react very favourably on all supply questions and in itself secure many of the advantages of the central supply organisation, as in default of such a General Staff, a Central Supply Organisation would either become itself an authority on war effort,, or its efficiency would be impaired by lack of authority as to allocation of industrial strength as against the different phases of war effort. Accordingly, on the broadest lines I am opposed to the scheme.Considering it from the standpoint of my own department I am prepared to admit that there &apos;is a sphere in which concentration of government supplies in the hands of tho Supply Department would be of advantage.     I refer&apos; to the great mass of supplies which are common to all departments, what I may call the running plant of government !in the way of general stores where bulk oontracting can more readily be done and where combination of contracting and inspecting staffs may be inspected to produce efficiency and economy and great progress in standardisation.But I think that this concentration needs very careful consideration when we come to settle to what exactly it is to be applied.P.T.O.
There are very serious difficulties and dangers associated with tho divorce of supply of a technical character from the control of the designer and user,Since the inception of the second Air Board, we have had experience&apos;of two procedures concerned with suppl Under the second Air Board we had two independent consumin authorities in the form of the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Plying Corps.     The technical part of the work vrt done by the Air Board&apos;and the supply and production oarriej out by the Ministry of Munitions.     Only by the closest col operation and exercise of the best good will was it found possible to make good progress, and when tho Air Ministry was constituted I Insisted on tho necessity for deleting one of the three separate authorities.     This was done byhanding the Ministry of in the form supplier inDesign and Technical Department over to theMunitions, and we were then left with the usor I of the Royal Air Force and the designer and the form of&apos;the Ministry of Munitions.     This arrangement has also only been successful, as Mr..Churchilll will agree, by an equally close degree of co-operation and[ exorcise of good will between the two authorities, and to such an extent has this been developed that the present Controller of the Technical Department is virtually responsible both to the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Munitions.Further, the Technical Department is practically entirely constituted of Royal Air Force Officers, theSupplI Department to a rather smaller extent, while both Departmor] have establishments based on Air Ministry establishments with corresponding ranks0The necessity for associating the user with the     , Technical Department is so great, that a constant circulatij of officers between the field and the Technical Department has boon found necessary.-   Further,, in such a highly technical form of supply,I wherein field experience must be rapidly embodied in production, the closest possible touch between the actual contracting and production authority and the Technical Department&quot;is involved.Accordingly, all experience goes to show that to moot the greatest difficulty of technical progress in aviati which in conjunction with the training of personnel constiti the surest foundation for a successful Air Force, there must an Air Ministry self-contained as to technical development and supply.tconclude therefore that the way to deal with the problem is to provide a central ministry of supply to deal with what I have called (for want of a better term) the running plant of Government departments but that each department must have the reserved power of keeping in its OH hands supply whore in its judgment that counse is necessary to its, own efficiency.23,10.18.mm.
