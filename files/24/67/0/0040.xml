Lffi^ATION BILL.f(0    J) ;!After the Emigration Bill had passed its second reading in the House of Commons it was referred to Standing. Committee B,    The number of members on this Committee is 77, The quorum is 20, including the Chairman, :&apos;Up to October 17th the Committee held nine meetings. The largest number present on any occasion was      including, the Qhairman,    On four occasions no quorum was present. Very little progress has been made with the Bill.   In fact the first clause has not yet been carried, and even in this several amendments have. been, made against the views of the Minister in charge, as it is found that the Government cannot command a working majority on the Committee owing to the abseneo of several of its supporters on war service.In these circumstances I think thqt the right courseis not to proceed with the Bill in Standing Committee B but-to introduce a now Bill into the House of Commons incorporating certain amendments which are considered^ of importance and have been put down after negotiation with the interests affected.The Emigration Bill is needed for two reasons. First, it effects a much needed measure of control over passage brokers and agents and Emigration Societies,   Such control was non-existent before the war, and the war has accentuated the necessity for it*    Secondly, it will enable a policy to bo formulated as to tho measure of assistance which can be given to gz-service men who wish to emigrate after the war, and practical measures taken to carry that, policy into effectsFor both these reasons, it is most desirable that thfcjBill should, piss into law this session,WJUu18.10.1918.DOWNING- STREET,
