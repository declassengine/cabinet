With reference to tho request of the .7or Cabinet (437 (17) on 28th June, 1918, that the Secretary of State for &apos; ar should issue instructions to the Departr-icnts concerned, in order that the necessary prpers concerning; men invalided from the Army might be received at the civil hospitals before the arrival of tnt men to whom they relate, the Army Council desire to point out in the first place that, except in the case of certain incurablet diseases, it is their practice.to retain unfit soldiers in the toy so long as they require indoor Hospital treatment, and when they no longer require such treatment, if unfit for further, military service, to discharge there from the Army, in which case the Ministry of pensions becomes responsible for their further oor$f2,   Incurable cases requiring permanent indoor hospital treatment are discharged from the Army and retained in &quot;Military Hospitals as free patients until the Lihi atry of Pensions can arrange for their transfer to an Institution under the Jeinistry of other Civil Authority.3.   prior to the 3lst August the procedure was as follows21 days before a soldier was due for discharge from Hospital he was medically boarded end a statement on Army Form v;.3555 was prepared in duplicate giving particulars of the man, the hospital from which discharged, nature of disability and treatment recommended, one copy being handed to the man,and the other forwarded direct to the Local V.ar pensions Committee of the district in which the man intended to reside.In addition the man&apos;s discharge documents, including tho Report of the 1 edical Board (Army Form  .179) and the I cdical History Sheet (Army Form P.178) were forwarded through the officer in charge Records to the I inistry of Pensions in time to reach the Finistry at least 10 days before the*man&apos;s discharge from hospital.   The Ministry fit pensions were therefore in a position to make arrangements for any further necessary treatments4.   As the result of conferences between this Department and the Ministry of pensions a new scheme for effecting the&apos; discharge of soldiers was agreed to and came into operation on the 31st August.Under the new procedure as soon as it has been decided that a soldier, who is a patient in hospital, is to be brought before an invaliding Board, a notification is sent by the Officer in Charge Hospital to the Secretary, Local tfar pensions Com-mittee, on Army Form W.5001.   (This gives about a week&apos;e warning.)   On the date on which the soldier&apos;s discharge from the army is approved, i.e. the date on which he leaves hospital for his home, one copy of Army Form V.3555 /  is given to theJ For contents see para.3.man
man, a second copy together v?ith Army Form .7.3463.A. (report to Local Committees of the War pensions Committee on Soldiers discharged) is at the same time cent to the Officer in Charge of kecords who forwards them within 24 hours of their receipt direct to the Secretary, Local Committee of the -.7ar pensions Committee.   The man&apos;a other discharge documents including Army Form&apos;B.179a - (Radical Report on a Soldier Boarded prior to Discharge) and Army &quot;Form P,.179b - (statement by a Soldier concerning his own oase) are forwarded through the Officer in Charge Records, to the ministry of pensions.&apos;   ; -       ; -       . , - ----- .On the day on which the soldier is discharged the Officer in charge the T-capital also forwards direct to the Ministry of pensions a special form - Medical Report on an Invalid (Army Form E.179c) containing all the necessary information (nature&apos;of disability, further treatment recommended etc.) to enable.the man*a treatment to be carried out without loss of continuity.   The man is also given a slip (Army Forml79.P.) containing particulars regarding previous operative treatment.   The linistry of Pensions and the Local Committee of the \7ar Pensions Cbmraittee are, therefore,  supplied with full information..5.   Under this system there should as far as the Army Council are aware be no difficulty in the documents reaching the Civil Hospital in good time, but the question of further acceleration rests with the Ministry of Pensions.KILMER.
RETENTION OF DISABLED        IN SERVICE UNTIL THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT IS COMPLETED.($ Memorandum by the Minister of pensions.With reference to the correspondence between Mr. Chamberlain tar Cabi-and Sir A. Griffith-Bo 3^2 awon, which originated in a Cabinet jt 437     Minute j^n on a Memorandum on treatment of discharged men by in, 1?     Sir Kenneth Goadby, and the subsequent interview between Sir A. Griffith Boseawen and Sir Kenneth Goadby, the Minister of Pensions desires to lay before the Cabinet the following consi derations,(1)   Men are now discharged from the Army when the Military Authorities have decided that&quot;(a) they are not likely to be of any further use for. the. service and (b) they no longer require in-patient treatment in hospitals.(2)   The result of this system, which is no. doubt based on the necessity of clearing the hospitals for fresh cases from overseas as quickly as possible, is to throw on to the oommunity a very large number of men who require further treatment either as out-patients or in many cases as in-patients.   For in many-wound cases an interval has to elapse before a second operation can be performed,  and the men have been discharged during the interval.(3)   It is the duty of tho Ministry of Pensions to provide for treatment after discharge.    . The Ministry has done it   utmost. ! Starting with practically no facilities or accommodation it hascreated its own accommodation in many places and has made arrangements with a very large numbed of private hospitals etc., with the result that to-day 30,000. discharged men are receiving treatment.   The Ministry is in a weak position however,   It has no disciplinary powers.   It fiannot compel men to receive treatment. By the provisions of the Warrant of 1917 it can place pecuniary inducements in their way and can penalize them by reducing the pension by one&apos;half if thoy unreasonably refuse.    But many men do and will refuse, since they can get such high wages at the present time.   Others refuse because they know that if their physical impairment becomes less, their pension will be reduced, and they sacrifice their future health to present high pension. The question is one of great difficulty.(4)   The Ministry feel that as the men have been impaired ; in Army Service it is the duty of the Army to repair them sofar as is humanly possible.   They should be kept in the Army on Army pay and under Army discipline until everything in the way of treatment has been done for them which can be done, and I then, but not till then, they should be discharged and receiveI their pension.   This does, not mean that they need continueto oocupy   hospital beds unnecessarily.   When they are fit to leave I hospital, but require out-patient treatment, they could be billetedj near the hospital where the; out-patient treatment is to be received,1 and in cases where they are awaiting further in-patient treatmentI they could be sent home on furlough being retained in the service.I The same principle should apply in sickness as well as in wounda oases, e.g. cases of tuberculosis, rheumatism, bronchitis, etc.T The details of the proposed arrangement could doubtless be workedI out between the medical staffs of the w&quot;ar Office and the1 Pensions Ministry.   Similar arrangements oould be made with ;!; the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.(5)   The
(5)   The matter will become specially urgent on the termination of hostilities.   The Military Authorities propose that 6 months after this occurs the further treatment of the men then in Hospital should be transferred to the ministry.   In tho view of the Minister of pensions thia is a proposal which cannot be accepted.   The men should be retained in the Army until their cure is completed.   Otherwise there is no guarantee that the men who ex-hypothesi have become civilians will even consent to remain in hospital in some cases, the Minister of pensions having no power to compel them.(6)   The J inister of pensions desires to add that he hopes that this most important matter may have the early consideration cf the .,&apos;ar Cabinet since the welfare of thousands of discharged disabled men may depend on the decision arrived at .(Intlld.)
