Committees are now considering next year&apos;s programme.&apos;&quot;&apos;If sufficient labour is forthcoming there will be no difficulty in getting a good acreage ploughed, but the shortage cf labour; -and - the - unfortunate harvest ere going to make the work of Committees very difficult.

Tlaei&quot;allocation has been made on a basis of about J-th of the quantities applied for.In disposing of the quantity of Sulphate allocated, merchants have been asked to meet as far as possible all orders where, the fertiliser is required for immediate&quot; applica-rtion to growing crops, such as Autumn wheat,&quot; 3*   Supply of. Feeding-Stuffs. Rationing of Live Stocks&quot;In anticipation of the scarcity of cattle feeding stuffs during the coming winter, it has been decided by tho Ministry of Food,;in-consultation with the Board and the English Department of Agriculture, that arrangements should be made for securing the distribution of&quot;such quantities as are available to the^classes of live,stock that it is important should be conserved in the national interest and that arrange-,:ment,s should be made - in such a /way that the most important classes of animals should have, a preference -over&apos; the less important .classes-.  , \ . -The classes-of live stock that will be entitled toreceive /
receive supplies are:-    Cows in,milk,. Calves under 6 months, Horses (transport horses, pit ponies, and horses kept for agrioixl-:tural purposes), Bulls kept for breeding, Sows in farrow, Boars, Store pigs, breeding Bams, (Mil stock).   Arrangements have also been made for the supply of grain and meal mixtures;, for special utility breeds of poultry.It is proposed to leave certain classes of feeding stuffs &quot;free&quot; for tho moment for supplementing ration allowances and feeding classee of stock for which no definite provision has been made.    The feeding stuffs to be controlled meantime are Oleaginou cakes and meals, Compound cakes and meals, Millers&apos;&apos; offals and Brewers&apos; and Distillers&apos; by-products.The scheme will come into force on 17th November and will be administered by tho Live Stock Commissioners under the Ministry of Food.4*   Sale, of Horses Order.During the week 865 licences to sell horses were issued by the Board,bringing the total number issued to 41223.5*   Supply of Horses for 1918-19 cropping scheme.The Board have issued to District Agricultural Executive Committees the conditions upon which horses will be provided for hire to farmers during season 1918-19.
