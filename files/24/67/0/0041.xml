, DEMOBILISATION OF MUNITION INDUSTRIES.(OA l _1. THE attached papers should be of immediate interest to the Cabinet.At the threshold of any arrangements which may be made by the Ministry of Munitions for the disposition or transformation of the national factories stand the following alternatives: (a.) Is the Ministry of Munitions to come to an end six months after the conclusion of peace, are its elements to be completely dispersed, and are its functions, in so far as they are required in peace time,, to be resumed by other Government Departments ; or(b.) Are we to create a Ministry of National Supply, which will continue permanently to provide for the needs in material of the army, trie navy, the air service, and other Government Departments ?It is evident that the treatment of almost every problem connected with the return of our factories from a war to a peace basis is affected profoundly by a decision either way.If it were decided to adopt the second alternative (b), it would not, of course, be proposed to make any change during the continuance of the war. But the objective towards which we should be working being clearly indicated, every step could be taken in proper relation to it. Neither is it necessary to decide at the present moment whether the manufacture of armaments is to continue after the war a matter for private enterprise. It is clear, however, that a decision in favour of the alternative (6) would undoubtedly tend in the direction of concentrating the production of armaments in the hands of the Ministry of National Supply, and our arrangements for the disposition and utilisation of existing plants and factories would no doubt bo made with the idea that the private production of armaments would gradually dwindle away.2. Once the above decision in principle has been given practical action to dispose of national factories, &amp;c, can be taken. This has become a matter of critical urgency. Until the Cabinet decision of the 9th October was taken I considered that the responsibilities of the Minister of Munitions were completely discharged when he had furnished to the Minister of Reconstruc-tion all the information in his power. The closest accord has been preserved between the work of the Mmistry&apos;s Demobilisation and Reconstruction Committee and Dr. Addison, and with ,a view to this accord I especially selected a year ago Mr. Piggott, Dr. Addison&apos;s former private secretary, as[885-1]
the head of the Departmental organisation dealing with these subjects. Dr. Addison is, therefore, I believe, fully apprised of every aspect of the situation and is in agreement with the steps that have been taken. But the Minister of Reconstruction has no executive power, and it is now necessary that definite authority to conclude bargains and arrangements in this field should be vested in some Minister. If desired, I am prepared to adapt portions of my existing extensive organisation to undertake this duty, provided, however, that the powers set out in the attached Paper A are accorded to the Minister of Munitions.3. The third extremely important step which should be taken is the amalgamation, for the purposes of the demobilisation of civilian labour, of all the existing Labour Departments of the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, and the War Office. This really means that Sir Stephenson. Kentfs Department absorbs the Others. No machine large enough to be capable of dealing with this problem exists apart from the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions, and no diversity or duplication of action should be tolerated at this time. 1 am sure that the Minister, whoever he may be, who is charged with the commercial and business aspects of the transformation of our industries from a war to a peace basis ought not to be burdened with the intricate study of the labour problems which are simultaneously involved. One man working in the closest accord with the Ministry of Munitions should have this matter in his charge, and should have at his disposal all the machinery for labour distribution which exists at the present time in the country. I presume that Parliamentary responsibility will rest with the Minister of Labour.I trust these matters may be the subject of early decisions.WINSTON S. CHLBOHILL.October 18, 1918.
[This Document&apos;is&apos;the Property-of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.SECRET.A.NOTE TO THE MINISTER OF MUNITIONS FROM THE MUNITIONS COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON DEMOBILISATION AND RECON-STRUCTION.THE attached report on the work of the Council Committee on Demobilisation and Reconstruction, for the year ending the 30th September, 1918, will show the extent to which the Committee have been able to survey their field of enquiry, and the prepara-tions that have been made to deal with the situation that will arise on the cessation of hostilities.The Committee desire to draw your attention to the concluding paragraph of the report, in which they point out that it is imperative to press for a decision from the Government on certain questions of policy.As the occasion for immediate action may now arise at any moment, the Committee wish to present to you in a summary form their views as to the powers that should be exercised by the Minister of Munitions during the transitional period, and the duties which will probably fall to the lot of the Ministry of Munitions to discharge. Without these powers it is contended that the Ministry of Munitions cannot play its proper part in assisting the country through the crisis.The powers required may be classified under seven heads : 1. The termination of contiacts for the supply of munitions.2. The disposal of stores, stocks of materials, machinery, &amp;c, in the possession ofthe Ministry of Munitions. 3. The arrangements for the disposal, or post war use, of national factories, withtheir plant and equipment. 4. The control of materials during the transitional period.5. The special arrangements with the iron and steel trade required in order to secure continuity of output from the blast furnaces and rolling mills.6. The reinstatement of peace industry, particularly in the engineering and chemical trades.7. The demobilisation of civilian munitions labour.These points are dealt with below in the order indicated.1. The termination of Contracts for the Supply of Munitions The Minister is already possessed of complete power to terminate contracts entered into by him. The only additional authority he will require is that which can be obtained by direct application to the Treasury for sanction of the financial arrangements that may have to be made with individual contractors on the termination of their contracts. No further powers in this respect seem to be required.The Committee propose that the manufacture of munitions, which are no longer required for the successful prosecution of the war, should be terminated at the earliest possible moment. They consider that the Minister should be empowered to give a month&apos;s notice, or a month&apos;s pay at a flat rate to be determined on generous lines, in lieu of notice, to all work-people whose services are dispensed with. It is understood that the Ministers present powers are insufficient to enable him to give instructions to employers in this matter, and that further powers are immediately required.2. The di sposal of Stores, Stocks of Materials, Machinery, &amp;c, in the possession of the Ministry of Munitions The present position is extremely unsatisfactory. Lord Salisbury&apos;s Advisory Council and Executive Board for [the disposal of surplus Government property have been in existence since 4th March, 1918. Various attempts have been made to define their functions and powers by Treasury minute, but it has proved impossible to obtain agreement between the various departments interested. In the meantime, the Surplus Stores Department of the Ministry have been proceeding with the day-to-day disposal of obsolete munitions, scrap, surplus machinery, and other movable property no
longer required by the Ministry. When the time comes, however, to cease manufac-turing munitions and to commence the task of liquidating some of the enormous assets in the possession of the Ministry, the machinery for selling, or otherwise disposing of stores, &amp;c, will need to be greatly strengthened.The Committee are very strongly of opinion that the Minister should retain the power to dispose of all stores or other movable property in the possession of the Ministry. It should be pointed out that large quantities of materials have been delivered to contractors to enable them to carry out their contracts, and plant and machinery have, in many cases, heen installed in their works on terms which form part of the contracts themselves. It seems inconceivable that any other body than the Ministry of Munitions, who have been in constant relations with these firms, and on whose behalf the articles to be disposed of have been manufactured, should be responsible for disposing of the property thus accumulated.The Committee consider that an outside Advisory Council, to which questions of policy or of overlapping interests in connection with the disposal of stores could be referred, would serve a useful purpose ; but they are strongly of opinion that the executive responsibility in connection with the actual disposal should rest with the Minister, and that no independent Executive Disposal Board is required.In the case of stores of similar types, in the possession of more than one Government Department, it would be open to the Advisory Council to recommend that the disposal should be entrusted to the Department chiefly interested.The Committee consider that the Minister is in a position to give an assurance that an efficient organisation can be evolved from the existing staff of the Ministry, effectively to deal with the disposal of stores in its possession, and with similar problems that may arise during the transitional period in connection with the disposal and distribution of material.In this connection it is important to point out that the outside area organisation of the Ministry is exceedingly well adapted to the decentralisation of this kind of work. Through this organisation many of the difficulties connected with the disposal oi material, &amp;c, could be settled locally. The materials could, in fact, be solcl where they lie, thus saving transport and unnecessary handling.3. The Arrangements for the Disposal, or Post-War Use, of National Factories.It was not until 9th October, 1918, that, by a decision of the War Cabinet, the Minister was empowered to enter into negotiations for the disposal of an)7 national factory which would clearly not be required for public purposes, and to conclude the sale or lease subject to the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction, and the sanction of the Treasury. This decision will enable the Minister to negotiate with outside bodies for the sale or lease of a factory. He should, however, also be empowered to maintain a national factory in temporary activity should he consider it desirable to do so, and he should be at liberty, in consultation with the Ministry of Reconstruction, to prepare plans for turning over national factories to the production of commodities required in bulk by the Government or by public bodies.4. The Control of Materials during the Transitional Period.At the meeting of the War Priorities Committee on Tuesday 15th October, it was decided that during the transitional period, and until further arrangements were made, the control by the Government of various kinds of materials should continue to be exercised by the Departments in which it was at present vested. The controlling Departments in the Ministry will therefore continue to exercise their functions so long as control is needed, and will do their utmost to facilitate the flow of materials to useful industries, acting, whenever necessary, in accordance with the instructions of the Post-War Priority Authority.5. Special Arrangements Required with the Iron and Steel Trade.The cessation of munitions production automatically necessitates the re-allocation of the output of the blast furnaces and rolling mills. During the war it has been necessary to grant subsidies in order to maintain a uniform price of steel for munitions productionThere can be no question that the Government will be compelled to take steps to secure the maintenance of the output of steel for peace purposes. It is consequently a matter for immediate decision to determine what arrangements are to be made with the manufacturers to ensure (a) that output of the fundamental forms of steel and iron
is not checked ; (6) that manufacturers are not placed in a position to enhance prices; (c) that abnormal speculative movements of price are avoided; and (d) that during the transitional period the product is distributed according to an allocation laid down by the Government.The Minister must therefore obtain authority to undertake the necessary negotiations with the steel and iron manufacturers, and to issue instructions with regard to the manufacture of steel for peace purposes. This may involve a guarantee on the part of the State to indemnify makers of steel and iron stocks against loss, or a continuance of the sale of imported ore at a fixed price, or even the purchase and holding of the surplus stocks by the State.These powers are urgently required and . may have to be exercised at very short notice. It would appear that they can only be exercised by the Minister of Munitions, who, at the present time, has complete control of the iron and steel industry.6. The Reinstatement of Peace Industry, particularly in the Engineering and Chemical Trades.The case of the iron and steel trade is an exceptional one, both from the point of view of urgency and of its fundamental industrial importance. But similar powers may be required in the case of other industries which have been forcibly diverted to muni-tions production, in order to assist them to resume their normal trade. It is inevitable that the manufacturers who have been in very close touch with the Ministry of Muni-tions should look to them for assistance, whether in the matter of financing the supply of materials or of making other arrangements for the rehabilitation of their industry.During the transitional period, at any rate, it seems desirable that the Minister of Munitions should have power to act in these directions, subject to Treasury sanction.7. The Demobilisation of Civilian Munitions Labour.It is understood that the Minister of Reconstruction is submitting a proposal to the War Cabinet to the effect that a Director-General of Civil Demobilisation should be appointed, who would act under the Minister of Labour. The Director-General would have under his control the existing labour machinery of various Government Depart-ments, including the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions and the Shipyard Labour Department of the Admiralty.Under this arrangement the Minister of Munitions would have no direct responsi bility for the reinstatement of workpeople discharged from munition industries, nor for their maintenance after the period of notice of discharge had expired.The Committee considers that this division of responsibility offers a workable arrangement. The only recommendation they would wish to make is that the Labour Department of the Ministry of Munitions, with its local area representatives, should be maintained as an integral unit in the new organisation. They consider this would offer the best means of safeguarding the interests of munition workers, owing to the accu-mulated knowledge and experience of the Department in handling labour questions in. mnnition factories.

PART I.-ORGANISATION.CHAPTER I. THE COMMITTEE AND ITS WORK, l. Appointment and Membership.The Committee was appointed on 3rd November, 1917, as a Standing Committee of the Munitions Council to consider all matters within the Ministry of Munitions connected with demobilisation and reconstruction. The Committee was given authority to appoint Sub-Com-mittees and. to invite other officers of the Ministry or persons unconnected with the Ministry to serve on such Sub-Committees.The original constitution of the Committee as announced in General Memorandum No. 42 was as follows :  Sir James Stevenson, Bart. (Chairman).Sir W. Graham Greene, K.C.B.Mr. P. G. Henriques.Major J. W. Hills, M.P.Mr. W. T. Lay ton, C.B.E.Mr. H. H. Piggott,Sir Keith Price.Mr. E. G. L. Bertram, Secretary.This Committee superseded the Ministry of Munitions Reconstruction Committee which was created by Dr. Addison as Minister of Munitions in April, 1917 (General Memorandum No. 2), and consisted of Sir Arthur Duckham, Sir-James Stevenson, Sir Frederick Black, Mr. C. W. Fielding, Sir Stephenson Kent, Mr. W. T. Layton, Sir Ernest Moir, Mr. E. B. Phipps. Mr. K. B. Quinan, Sir Alexander Roger and Sir Glynn West, with Mr. G. D. Hutchins as Secretary. It was Dr. Addison&apos;s desire that, whenever possible, either he himself or one of the Parliamentary Secretaries should preside.The Council Committee held its first meeting on 15th November, 1917, since which time weekly meetings have taken place.- Sir James Stevenson was compelled by the pressure of his official duties to relinquish the Chairmanship of the Committee, and on .16th December, .1917, Major Hills became Chairman in his place and acted in that capacity at the 7th meeting on 2nd January, 1918.At the 21st meeting, on 5th April, 1918, Major Hills resigned the Chairmanship, having decided to sever his connection, with the Ministry of Munitions in order to return to political life. Sir James Stevenson thereupon resumed the office of Chairman. (General Memorandum 83.)The membership of the Committee was extended in January by the addition of Mr. J. E. Masterton Smith, O.B., the Assistant Secretary to the Ministry, who had already been attending the meetings of the Committee ex officio. In February, Sir Stephenson Kent was appointed to represent the Labour Group, and since he found it impossible to attend regularly it was decided in June that Mr. H. Wolfe, C.B.E., should join the Committee, and that if he found himself unable to be present at any meeting his place should be taken by Mr. J. A. N. Barlow, C.B.E., or Mr. T. M. Taylor, C.B.E.In March, Mr. W. J. Larke, O.B.E., who had been attached to the Secretariat for special work in connection with demobilisation and reconstruction, was also appointed a member of the Committee.   (G.M. 69.)In March, 1.918, Mr. Bertram resigned the position of Secretary to the Committee in order to devote himself exclusively to the work of Secretarial Officer to the &quot;0&quot; Group of the Munitions Council. His place as Secretary was taken by Mr. G. I. II. Lloyd. Miss D. M. Fry, M.B.E., became Assistant Secretary to the Committee.The present constitution of the Committee (September, 1918) is therefore as follows:-Sir James Stevenson, Bart. (Chairman).Sir Graham Greene, K.C.B.Sir Philip Henriques, K.B.E.Sir Stephenson Kent, K.C.B.Mr. W. J. Larke, O.B.E.Mr. W. T. Layton, C.B.E.Mr. J. E. Masterton Smith, C.B.Mr. H. H. Piggott, C.B.E.Sir Keith Price.Mr. II. Wolfe, C.B.E.Mr. G. I. H. Lloyd.(Secretary).Miss I). M. Fry, M.B.E. (Assistant Secretary).2. The Reconstruction Department.In April, 1917, a. Reconstruction Department was established in the Ministry under the charo-e of Sir&apos;Arthur Duckham and Sir James Stevenson in order to assisit the Reconstruction Committee then appointed by Dr. Addison in the work of collecting and considering reports, and formulating questionnaires (General Memorandum No. 2, Section 7). Mr. F. G. L. Bertram was appointed a Secretary in this Department (General Memorandum No. 7, Section 4), and was assisted by Mr. R. M. Aitkin and a small staff. .....   , ,
When the Council Committee was appointed, it was again found necessary to establish an organisation which should he responsible for the day to day work connected with recon-struetion, for preparing memoranda or conducting enquiries, the results of which could in due course he submitted to the Committee. By this arrangement it was hoped that the Committee would be able to concentrate its attention on important issues of principle, while it would be tlie duty of the officers of the Department to work out points of detail ami to ensure that continuous progress was made with the questions under consideration.It was accordingly decided to strengthen the Reconstruction Department, which had been since October, 1917, in the charge of Mr. H. II. Piggott, C.B.E., one of the Assistant Secre-taries of the Ministry. Mr. Piggott had been made generally responsible for reconstruction questions within the Ministry, and had been acting, by arrangement with Dr. Addison, as liaison officer with the Ministry of Reconstruction (General Memorandum No. 32).The reconstituted department consisted of Mr. Ii. II. Piggott, C.B.E., Mr. W. J. Larke, O.B.E., and Mr. G. I. II. Lloyd, assisted by Mrs. E. Wood, O.B.E., on statistical questions.3. Functions of the Committee : Relations with the Ministry of Reconstruction.The scope of the Committee as defined in General Memorandum 42 was the consideration of all questions connected with demobilisation and reconstruction. In a minute of November 5th the Minister emphasized the importance of having ready some scheme by which the factories could be moved from war to peace production at the moment hostilities ceased, and in a later minute of January 14, 1918, elaborated his statement.&quot; You have therefore to make a great scheme, necessarily crude and bold in its outline of what enterprise each class of munitions production is to he turned to. You have got to assume the same public credit as exists in time of war will be temporarily continued and you ought to he able to issue at 10 days&apos; notice directions which will switch the great volume of our production on to new lines. Where it cannot be done, you will have to arrest the production of war material at the earliest point at which it can be boiled down for civil purposes, meanwhile keeping everbody paid (i.e., rationed)and maintained in their existing workshop.....In view of the uncertainty ofthe situation you should not shrink from working out a very crude and general scheme, which can he refined later as time permits.&quot; The Minister also defined his conception of the limits of work between the Ministry of Munitions Committee and the Ministry of Reconstruction in a minute of Kith February, 1918.&quot;Although the Ministry of Munitions necessarily must deal with the questions of day to day discharges and contraction in our total number of employees and must continually he studying the methods by which the situation arising on peace is to he tided over, I am of opinion that &apos;the general application of war industry to peace industry constitutes a principal part of the work of the Ministry of Reconstruction. We should supply them with the data obtained from our knowledge of the particular firms and industries under our control and with suggestions as to the alternative forms of production which can he substituted on the cessation of hostilities. But they alone can make a broad, scheme. I am therefore of the opinion that the Minister of Reconstruction should he asked by us to prepare a general scheme for the utilisation of munitions labour on a declaration of peace and that our Reconstruction and Demobilisation Committeeshould seek to supply him with all the necessary information.....We shallincur very severe censure if we are not found with detailed plans and a carefully con-sidered policy should the war come to an end unexpectedly. The ground must he thoroughly explored and it can only be explored by the Minister of Reconstruction. This is in fact the most practical and urgent portion of the work and it certainly ought not to continue to be merely a subsidiary departmental study of the Ministry of Munitions.&quot; These two minutes from the Minister state the objects and -extent of the Committees work and the subsequent chapters of this report outline the attempts made to cover the ground.One of the first acts of the Council Committee was to get into touch with the Minister of Reconstruction in order to arrive at an understanding as to the ground to he covered by the Committee, so as to avoid, as far as possible, any overlapping with the work of the Ministry of Reconstruction. On November 9th, 1917, accordingly, at an interview with Dr. Addison it was agreed that the Ministry of Munitions Committee would consider and report on the following subjects:  (1) National Factories.(a) How the work at present carried on in them could best be terminated on the cessation&quot; of hostilities.(b) Their future use, whether for the manufacture of munitions or for industrialpurposes.(c) Ptor what peace-time production their plant and machinery were most suited.(2) The termination of munition contracts in f/enwil, and the consequent displacement ofld :0(3) The Ministry of Munitions Area Organisation, and the best use to which it could he put during the transition period.(4) Control of materials and priority.(a) The adaptation of the war priority organisation to post-war conditions(b) The allocation of materials to post-war demands.(c) The possible development of the Priority Department into a clearing-house for post-war orders. , &apos;.t   ... , ,      .At &amp; later interview the Ministers view as to the respective spheres of the Ministry ot Reconstruction and the Ministry of Munitions in matters connected with industrial demolnlisa--tion and reconstruction was explained to Dr. Addison, i.e., that   the Ministry of Munitions19430 t A 8
Demobilisation Committee should limit itself to consideration of the arrangements to be made and the instructions to be issued during the transitional period, and that all large questions of future policy should be left to the Ministry of Reconstruction.&quot; To this Dr. Addison agreed, but stilted that he would need technical advice as to the possible uses io which munition factories and plants could be put under peace conditions.It will be noticed that at these interviews Dr. Addison expressed no desire that the Ministry of Munitions should assume any responsibility lor the preparation of plans connected with the demobilisation of labour. The Committee have throughout acted on the assumption that, while it was their duty to offer to Dr.-Addison all the assistance and information in their power on labour questions, the responsibility for advising the Government and for the preparn-tion of schemes of labour demobilisation rested with him and with the Minister of Labour,CHAPTER II.HEADQUARTERS&apos; STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATION. 1. Demobilisation of Headquarters&apos; Staff.The question of tho demobilisation of headquarters&apos; staff was first taken up by the Ministry Reconstruction Department set up by Dr. Addison.In April, 1917, a questionnaire Avas issued to all lira neb es of the Ministry, which included questions as to the policy to be pursued in regard to departmental questions at the end of the war. Particular attention, was invited to the possible need of the continuance of the activities of different branches of the Ministry and the retention of their organisation? either temporarily or permanently.SerialNo.ll. This inquiry drew from Deads of Departments some valuable expressions of opinion, and indicated the need for a more thorough exploration of the problem of industrial organisa-tion during the transitional period as a prelude to a decision on questions connected with the actual winding up of the activities of the Ministry.After considerable progress had been made in the survey of these correlated problems as will be indicated elsewhere in. this review it became possible to concentrate attention upon the more immediate aspects of the question, namely, the arrangements that must be made in advance to provide for the dispersal and retention of staff and re-grouping of departments that would follow on a sudden termination of hostilities.The matter was taken up by the newly created Reconstruction Department of the Ministry, and on 25th March, 1918, the Establishment Branch was requested to carry out a fresh inquiry, in order to ascertain in. respect of each department of the Ministry :  (i) the. period required for winding up the work&quot; of the department and the rate ofdismissal or retention of the staff; (ii) the personnel whose retention would be necessary during this period, and, in parti-cular, the responsible or administrative officers whose services would be indispen-sable, and the steps that should be taken to secure the availability of such officers or of substitutes for them.Sev;a] &apos; A circular, intended to elicit the necessary information, dated 7th May, 1918, wasNo. Ml.      circulated to Supply and Administrative Departments of the Ministry, and a summary of thereplies was submitted to the Committee on 17th July, 19.18. Serial The question was then referred to the Reconstruction Department for further analysis,No. 157. and a. memorandum reviewing the whole problem was prepared, the principal features of which may be briefly indicated :  Tho departments of the Ministry, grouped according to function, may be arranged in order of their relative permanence as follows:  Group    I.   Supply departments proper.Group   II.   Factory construction and industrial equipment departments.Group III.   Materials departments.Group IV.   Administrative and regulative departments.Group   V.   Financial departments.Group VI.   Military and scientific departments.This arrangement reflects the view that Supply work proper will show the earliest and most rapid shrinking; while, at the other extreme, come tho financial branches, which will require prolongation up to two years or longer, and the purely military branches which must be regarded as having a permanent establishment.Group I. Supply Departments. It is suggested that the principle to be adopted in this group on demobilisation will bo the telescoping of sections and departments into one another in accordance with a prepared plan, and their amalgamation with, or into, an appropriate administrative organi-zation.In point of permanence the work of (a) supervising the termination of contracts must be clearly distinguished from the responsibility for (6) the administration of national factories.(a) It is thought that the former will in most cases be very largely completed within threemonths, or less, from the time when output is no longer required. (/)) The administration of national factories could be conveniently grouped in a Central Factories Brand), which would take over responsibility for this work from all departments which at present havo factories in their charge.Group II. Industrial Equipment. The Central Factories Branch would also, presumably, absorb the accompanying responsibilities connected with the completion of factories in course of construction and questions of industrial equipment, except as otherwise provided.Group III. Materials Departments. These are primarily concerned with the control of output and supply. It lias been assumed that the guiding principle in this group will be the substitution of priority regulation for direct administrative control, and that, in consequence, there will be a
rapid diminution of staff, loading to the transfer of a reduced organisation to a Central Priority Department.   This reduction in staff should make rapid progress during the first six months.In special cases where more permanent control is contemplated, e.g., in the manufacture of explosives, optical glass, potash, &amp;c, special provision must be made for the, retention of the appropriate organisation.Group IV. Administrative and Regulative Departments. Tho two principal functions of this group during demobilisation will he:  (o) Salvage and disposal of surplus stores; (b) Priority control.In connection with each provision must be made for the necessary expansion of the organisation.Tins Labour Department, on a reduced basis, is likely to be absorbed by the Ministry of Labour unless its retention in nucleus is required in any future Ministry of Supply&quot;.Group V. Financial Departments. As already indicated, those will show the greatest expansion, and, in particular, the suggested amalgamation of.supply and contracts work will involve many months of great activity. The final termination of contracts&apos; and adjustment of accounts is estimated to require a still longer period extending over two years or more.It is in this group that the retention of skilled technical officers is thought to present features of special urgency and difficulty.Group VI. Military apd Scientific, Departments In these cases a small nucleus staff will need to be retained and tho Departments will shrink to the basis required as a permanent establishment.The Inspection Department presents a separate problem, since it is expected to take a prominent part, both in the work of clearing the factories, terminating contracts, &amp;c, and in tho subsequent task- of sentencing and disposing of stores, both those in course of manufacture and those returned from overseas..    The following&apos; recommendations were therefore made to tlie Committee by the Reconstruc-tion Department, and are still under consideration :  (a) The ordinary Munitions Supply Departments as at present constituted will probably come to an end automatically within three months of the end of the war, when their remaining&apos; functions should be handed over to an appropriate administrative organisation.(h) That a central Factories Branch should be set up to administer the national factories which may remain under the control of the Department.(c) Control and Allocation of Materials will probably be transferred to a Central PriorityDepartment, if possible before the cessation of hostilities.   Responsibility for sale of stocks will pass to a Surplus Stores Department.(d) Fin ance and, Accounts.   The activities of this Department will continue on a con-siderable scale for some years and efforts should be made to retain as many as possible of the higher staff, as the proportion of civil servants in these Departments is comparatively insignificant.(e) Military Design, Inspection and Invention, Chemical and Mechanical, Warfare.   Asmall nucleus staff will be needed in each case, the retention of the necessary officers should present no difficulty as many of the higher staff are regular soldiers. . (/) Departments Connected with Trade Encouragement, e.g., optical glass, potash, gauges, agricultural machinery, chemical and fertiliser manufacture, &amp;c. These will probably be transferred to other Government Departments and steps should be taken to maintain a sufficient staff to ensure continuity of policy.2. Transfer of Functions to other Departments.Until the question of the creation of a Ministry of Supply has been decided, the considera-tion of the problem of the final disposal of the proposed Central Factories and of the Contracts, Finance and Labour Departments of the Ministry must remain in abeyance.Recommendations with regard to certain specialised functions may, however, be made independently of the decision in tlie above matter. Thus it is probable that departments con-nected with trade encouragement and the maintenance of &quot;key &quot; industries will be transferred to other Government Departments, eg., optical glass, potash, gauges, agricultural machinery, chemical and fertiliser manufacture, magnetos, ball bearings, &amp;c. Purely military functions will presumably revert to the War Office, and research work may be transferred to the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research.In each case arrangements must be made for the retention of the necessary technical nucleus staff on a permanent basis.3. Ministry of Supply.The Finance and Contracts Departments present the most difficult problem in the de- Serial No. mobilisation, of the Ministry, for, apart from their duty of winding up the affairs of the Ministry 170. so long as it continues to exist as an independent body, they discharge, with the Supply Departments, certain duties which will need to be continued. Arrangements for the supply of warlike stores after the termination of the war must continue, and unless this function, which covers not only the placing and supervision of contracts, but also the management of any national factories that may be retained for the manufacture of munitions, reverts to the War Office, it must be assigned to some other permanent Government Department.The disadvantages attached to the present system by which some fifteen different Govern-ment Departments are engaged, to a greater or lesser extent, on independent purchasing and &apos; placing of contracts, are set forth in the Report recently submitted to the Treasury by the Inchcape Committee. That Committee was&apos; clearly of opinion that the ideal solution of the difficulty would be the creation of a Ministry of Supply, that would be generally responsible for carrying out purchases for all Departments of State.191 HO
It was only in view of the possible reluctance of the Government to make so great a change at this period of the war, that the Committee put forward as an alternative recommendation the formation of u standing Committee consisting of the Heads of the Contract Departments of the Admiralty, the War Office, Ministry of Munitions and Air Ministry, with an independent chairman.Should it be eventually decided to act upon the main recommendation of the Inchcape Committee, the surviving remnant of the Finance and Contracts Departments of the Ministry of Munitions would naturally pass to the Ministry of Supply.It may be pointed out that the idea of a central buying department for all Government purposes is not a new one, or even entirely without precedent. The old Board of Ordnance was responsible prior to 1855 for the supply of equipment, both to the Army and to the Navy; and so long ago as 1890 a Committee reported with favour on the creation of a joint department charged with the purchasing of all ordnance stores for the two services.While it may be said that the decision with regard to the creation of a Ministry of Supply affects all plans for the demobilisation of the Ministry of Munitions, the remark applies with peculiar force to those relating to finance and contracts, and to the control and management of national factories for the production of munitions.4. Rate of Shrinkage of Staff.No estimate can at present be made of the precise rate of shrinkage of the Ministry staff as a whole, or of the ultimate figure to which it Avill decline, but some idea of&quot; the effect of applying the above suggestions to the existing staff may be obtained by considering the various stages of expansion since the outbreak of war of the headquarters&apos; staff employed upon the supply of munitions for the Army. The table given below shows that the staff now employed by the Supply, Contracts and Finance Departments is approximately one hundred-fold as great as at the outbreak of war. Even should supplies be required in the future for an army ten times the size of the pre-war peace establishment it seems reavsonable to assume a shrinkage inSerial No.     the present total figures to one-fifth, or one-tenth within a year or eighteen months of the157. cessation of hostilities.

Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee on the meaning of &quot; The Period of the War.&quot;Serial No -&quot;-n ^ne^r nrs^ In&quot;terim Report, dated January 12th, 1918, Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee,105. appointed to consider the legal interpretation of the term &quot;period of the war,&quot; advised asfollows:  &quot;In our opinion, speaking of the legislation (i.e., the emergency war legislation) generally, the war cannot be said to end until peace is finally and irrevocably obtained;1 and that point of time cannot be earlier than the date when the treaty of peace is finally binding on the respective belligerent parties, and that is the date when ratifications are exchanged.&quot;Following on the report of this Committee a Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed on July 16th &quot; to report what provision should be made by Parliament for defining the meaning of the phrase &apos;end of the war&apos; and other similar phrases occurring in the War Emergency Statutes and for extending in whole or in part or shortening the period of operation of the several emergency statutes and the several Regulations made thereunder.&quot;2, Recommendations by Ministry of Munitions.The Ministry of Munitions were requested by the Minister of Reconstruction to prepare a statement of their views with regard to the continuance of the emergency legislation in which they were interested, for submission to the Select Committee.
11619430A memorandum on the subject was accordingly prepared by the Reconstruction Depart- Serial inent, in consultation with the legal advisers of the Ministry, and forwarded to the Ministry of No. .148. Reconstruction on July 19th.The following is a summary of the most important points in the memorandum:  1.   Ministry of Munitions Act, 1915.The winding up of the contractual and financial business of the Ministry will certainly require considerably more than a year after the termination of the war, the present statutory period during which the Ministry of Munitions will continue. Under the Act tho Minister of Munitions is not created in a corporate capacity, nor is he given express statutory power to hold land in his rcpre-sentative capacity as a Minister of the Crown. As a resu.lt, where estates and interests in land have been vested in the Minister, these will continue in tho individual and not in the office. Further, practically all contracts have been entered into in the name of the Minister, and there art* many outstanding interests and rights which may not be adjusted for a number of years. It is therefore essential that, at the winding up of the Ministry, provision should be made for the vesting in some duly authorised person of these various estates, interests, rights, and obligations, which, otherwise will, in certain eases, remain outstanding in tho individual Minister, and, in others, give rise to questions of extreme doubt and difficulty.2.  Munitions of War Acts, 1915, 1916, and 1917.While, so far as the direct object of the Ministry is concerned, there seems to bo no reason why these Acts should extend beyond the period of existence of the Ministry itself, yet the experience gained during the war in all matters affecting labour tends to show that some of the provisions under the Acts might with advantage either be made permanent in some form or other or at least be continued for some period beyond the war.(i) Compulsory Arbitration.- The main Act introduced the principle of compulsory arbitration to avoid strikes. In practice its main use has been to settle increases of wages and in that manner to avoid apprehended strikes, its secondary use has been to ensure the holding of an enquiry, and thereby to enable the public to judge of the rights of the case, and to end the strike by pressure of public opinion. If, therefore, there is any legislation dealing with labour difficulties, it is suggested that strikes and lock-outs should not in, themselves bo made illegal, but that compulsory arbitration should be retained in. some form, e.(]., in&apos;.the form of a Government enquiry.(ii) Government Control of Establishments: Continuance of the Tribunals System, Since tho absorption of the Munition Levy in the Excess Profits Tax, the only importance of control has been (a) that it suspends trade union practices, thereby making dilution possible, and (b) that it provides a method of enforcing discipline by means of the munitions tribunals. The experience of the Ministry shows very clearly that enforcement of discipline in works should be dealt with by tribunals and not by the ordinary law courts. The former are more popular, and the presence of an assessor repre-sentative of the workman inspires confidence. If some form of tribunal is retained, its jurisdiction should be extended to all matters arising out of the workman&apos;s contract of service. The power to deduct fines from wages should be continued, since by this means enforcement of the tribunals decisionsis possible without resort to imprisonment.   Further, it should be borne in mind that the success of   . the system is largely due to the right of appeal to a judge of the High Court.(iii) Regulation of Wages. So far as men are concerned there, seems to be no case, if control goes, for retaining the existing system of awards and Government regulation of wages. The more difficult question of the women, who are at present unorganised, may be met by the Trade Boards Bill at present before Parliament.(iv) Second Schedule ami Restoration of Pledges. The redemption of pledges made to trade unions as to the restoration after the war of pre-war trade customs will he dealt with by the Amending Bill now under consideration by the Minister of Reconstruction.3.   Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act, 1914 (and Amending Acts).The more important Regulations under these Acts from the point of view of the Ministry of Munitions are the following:  (i) Occupation of Land: Regulation Xo. 2__So far as concerns the question of the continuedoccupation of land of which possession has been taken for the purposes of the, Ministry of Munitions, the necessities of the case will be met by the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1910; it may, however, be necessary, during the period of demobilisation, to take possession under this Regu-lation of further land for storage purposes.(ii) Control of Manufacture: Regulations 7, 8, 8a. The. continued possession of factories, &amp;c. acquired under Regulation 8 is already provided for by the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act. The control exercised over many important industries under Regulation 8a will need to continue for some time after the termination of hostilities. It is inconceivable that the whole system of priority, organised under this Regulation, can be abandoned during the period of reconstruction, as it will still be necessary to, direct materials and manufacturing capacity into the most useful channels..(iii) Investigation of Costs: Regulation 15c. Under this Regulation, cost investigations -are pro-ceeding, which in numerous cases cannot bo terminated for many months or, in some cases, for years. These investigations aro essential for the execution of orders made under Regulations 2b and 2bb, &amp;e., dealing with the control of materials, and it would be impossible to allow these costing operations to come to an end until their entire, object has been accomplished. Moreover, it is worthy of serious consideration whether the right of the Government to investigate costs and adjust prices of stores required by them should not be made permanent, if for no other purpose than as a. necessary corrective to excessive prices which might otherwise be charged by tho Trusts which are at present growing up-under Government approval.(iv) Regulation of Prices: Regulation 30a. The power to control tho price of materials has been employed both to reduce profiteering and to limit speculation. The industries to which such Regula-tion has been applied have therefore been operated on a non-economic basis, and&quot;the abandonment of this artificial system must be carried out with caution. Further, the Ministry itself, as owner of very large stocks of metals, explosive materials, fertilisers, railway material, &amp;c, will need to retain some power of control over price fluctuation.(v) Control of Industrial Materials: Regulations 2bb, 2e, 7, 1.5o.-It appears essential that the powers conferred by these Regulations whereby supplies of raw materials are controlled and dealings in them regulated, should, subject to any necessary modification, be continued for some considerable period after the cessation of hostilities. Apart from the dangers of abrupt relaxation, control of tho supply of materials may be necessary with a view to allocation to the most Urgent post-war needs of the community.
PART II.-PREPARATIONS FOR THE CESSATION OF MUNITIONS PRODUCTION.CHAPTER IV.EFFECT OF THE DECLARATION OF AN ARMISTICE ON THE MANUFACTURE OFMUNITIONS.1. Inquiry addressed to Heads of Supply Departments.By circular dated 30th November, 1917, Heads of Supply Departments were asked to suggest the immediate steps that should be taken in factories and establishments under their control, and the instructions to be issued to them: .[a) In the event of an armistice being declared during negotiations for peace, or (6) in the event of peace being declared without a preliminary armistice. In particular they were invited to make suggestions on the following points:  (i) Should munitions and components actually in process of manufacture be completed ?(ii) Should completed munitions and components be retained at the factories?(iii) Should supplies at ports of shipment be increased?(iv) Should supplies already embarked proceed to the usual field depots?(v) Should the production of raw materials be continued without abatement?The replies to these questions covered many different topics bearing on general policy, con-tinuance of emergency legislation and administrative control, and hypothetical conclusions depending&apos; on the military situation, at the time in question.While on many specific points these suggestions were of considerable practical interest, only in a few eases were any common conclusions reached, the most important being the desirability of maintaining the supply of raw materials at the full rate while turning over intermediate stages of manufacture to peace products as rapidly as possible. As regards the final stages of munitions manufacture, the desirability of clearing the shops at the earliest moment was emphasised.The following particular recommendations were submitted to meet the event of an armistice:  (a) The Gun Ammunition Department recommended the reduction of manufacturing activity to a minimum, working day shifts only for alternate weeks, paying piece rates during the working week and a standard rate during the off week.   Meantime the shops should be cleared as far as possible, machinery repaired, swarf and scrap disposed of, and an 8 weeks&apos; supply of material&apos; should be placed in stock.(b) The Controller of Gun Ammunition Filling recommended that previous arrangements should be made for dealing with the labour situation.   Steps should be taken:  (i) To dismiss at once one-third of the employees in the Filling Factories;(ii) to abolish bonus and piece-work systems and substitute the flat rate;(iii) to reduce the number of workers gradually to the extent of another one-third.When the accumulated stock reached 12 weeks&apos; supply, he anticipated that there would be little difficulty, in the event of a breakdown in the negotiations, in getting the factories working again at full output before the stocks were unduly low. While the first third of the employees could be dismissed without fear of consequences, special precautions should be taken to retain a hold on the services of any further employees whom it might be found desirable to release.(c) The Explosives Supply Department recommended that, wherever possible, night shifts and Sunday work should be discontinued and output systematically reduced, but that the workers should not be paid off in bulk. A scheme for increasing manufacture of fertilisers should be put in force to absorb the displaced labour not occupied on cleaning up the plant.2. Position of Munitions Manufacture during; an Armistice.Taking these replies as a whole, it was felt by the Committee that some further analysis of the situation that would arise in the event of an armistice was necessary, and Mr. Layton was accordingly asked to consult with the Controllers of the Gun Ammunition, Gun Ammunition Filling and Explosives Supply Departments, and to prepare a memorandum.This memorandum, with the Ministers approval, was submitted to the War Office, on January 15th, 19.18, and also to the War Cabinet. The decision of the War Office was asked for with regard to the following formulation of the problem:  Three alternative forms of armistice may be considered: (a) The total cessation of all manufacture of munitions, or munitions material, and of the movement of these; (b) freedom to move raw material and to manufacture munitions, but not to move the latter towards the front; (c) complete freedom both of manufacture and movement.(a) This is unlikely to be acceptable to any belligerent owing to difficulty of resuming manufacture when once stopped. Moreover, no belligerent could ascertain whether the terms were being carried out. There is also a difficulty of definition. Nitrates might be imported as for agriculture, and steel as for industrial purposes. We should profit by the cessation of submarine warfare much more than the Germans would by the raising of the blockade.
11Jl(b)&apos; We -should stand to suffer by any clause limiting the cross (Jhauuel movement of finished munitions. The effect would differ at different times of year, but it would in any case cause a great accumulation of munitions in this country.If such a (dause were agreed to, our policy would be to supply France and Italy with raw materials up to their maximum capacity of munition manufacture, since they could rail their accumulations to the front.(c) Germany would not be likely to assent to such-a condition if it involved raising the submarine blockade.If all these hypotheses are set aside as impracticable it must be assumed that fighting will continue during negotiations, though on a defensive in place of an offensive scale. If under these circumstances shell filling were to be continued at normal rales a very large additional emergency storage would be required in France.Should the military authorities decide that this additional storage could be provided, filling-would be continued according&apos; to programme. Our position in unassembled components and materials would be strong, and much material might be diverted at once for railways, power stations, and other purposes useful for both war and peace. The shortage of material in France and Italy might also be relieved.Should the military authorities in France be unable to store the extra accumulation it must not be produced, as it could not be stored in this country or transported across Channel. The loss of output would on this hypothesis be irrecoverable.In either case manufacture of guns must continue as at present.The War Office; were, therefore, asked :  (i) Whether the three propositions stated above exhausted the possible forms of armistice ?(ii) Whether they concurred in the conclusion that during preliminary negotiations no restriction could be accepted on the output or movement of munitions ? . .  (iii) Whether they agreed that defensive warfare only was likely to be maintained during negotiations, and if complete cessation of hostile activity by land but not by sea was a possible contingency ? (iv) What was the maximum emergency storage available at short notice in France? (v) What was the maximum expenditure of ammunition that could be expected for three or four months after the failure of negotiations ?The reply of the Army Council to the above communication was as follows:  War Office, London, S.W.,Sir, 12th February, 1918.     SerialIn reply to your letter of the 15th January, 1918, enquiring what are the. conditions likely to- No. 30. prevail in the event of the conclusion of an armistice and covering a memorandum drawn up by your Department indicating the results from the munitions&apos; standpoint that would follow on certain assumptions as to these conditions, I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you, for the information of the Minister of Munitions, that an armistice implies nothing more than the suspensioii of hostilities in the area to which it extends and that every other act is lawful which is not strictly specified in the agreement to be unlawful. Accordingly, in the CounciFs opinion, the only condition for which provision need be made is that during the armistice naval warfare will continue and the blockade will not be raised.The. Council consider that on this assumption the manufacturing and filling programmes need not be maintained at their present level, since there would not bo sufficient storage accommodation in France and facilities for the transport to the various theatres of war of these stocks, if they were accumulated in England, would not be available.In these circumstances, therefore, the Council consider that in the event of the conclusion of an armistice the manufacture of munitions of which the supplies are adequate might safely be reduced, without prejudicing future expenditure, so far as is consistent with the possibility of restoring within six weeks the normal output in the event of a resumption of hostilities, and that the opportunity should be taken of supplementing stocks of those munitions in regard to which a shortage exists.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)      B. B. Cubitt.This ruling indicates, in effect, that the Army Council are prepared to take the risk of the Serial enemy continuing production during an armistice at maximum output and so storing munitions No. 31. in increased quantities behind the lines. The Ministry of Munitions can work out without much difficulty the necessary instructions in order to carry out the policy laid down in the War Office letter. Stocks in France will need to be filled to their maximum capacity. There would be an immediate reduction in output, and preparations would have to, be made for increased storage accommodation in this country to provide a sufficient stock to enable the maximum cross-Channel shipments to be at once resumed and maintained during the period required to bring the output up to its previous level, in the event of hostilities being resumed.CHAPTER V.TERMINATION  OF  CONTRACTS.1. Cessation of the useless Production of Munitions.In considering the question of the termination of supplies for military purposes two antagonistic policies have been discussed by the Committee.   .(a) That of continuing the manufacture of munitions on a reduced scale during the tran-sition period in order to mitigate unemployment.(b) That of discontinuing the production of useless munitions at the earliest possiblemoment, whatever the immediate effect might be upon the labour market.111430 A 6
In the preparation of their plans for the termination of contracts the Committee deliberately adopted the latter policy. On the cessation of hostilities the limitations of storage capacity will, in any wise, necessitate a rapid diminution, of output of gun ammunition and other bulky supplies, and on the other hand, the need for economising material and tor hastening the transition, to peace industry will make it most undesirable that (he output of useless munitions should be continued for a day longer than is absolutely necessary.TheiCommittee were fortified in their opinion by the knowledge that the Civil War-workers Demobilisation Committee were actively engaged in the preparation of a scheme for the payment of unemployment allowances to workpeople during the period of industrial demobilisation. Further reference is made to the work of this Committee in a later chapter of this Report. On the assumption that the Ministry of Labour would have the necessary organisation ready, when the time came, for the payment under proper safeguards of subsistence allowances to unemployed workpeople, it remained for the Ministry of Munitions to make their plans with a view to the &quot;most rapid turnover to peace-time production, and to the conservation of raw materials and their diversion to the most essential industrial purposes.The Minister of Reconstruction was invited to give his assent to the principle indicated above, in a letter dated March .1.9th, in which it was pointed out that &quot; to continue production of munitions for. which there is no future demand, even though it may assist in some measure in dealing with the question of employment during the transition period, must necessarily have the effect of utilising raw and semi-manufactured material which will be urgently required for commercial industry, and thus delay the change over of the munitions industries to the products of commerce.&quot;The reply from the Minister of Reconstruction on April 6th was in the following terms:-Ministry of Reconstruction, 2, Queen Anno&apos;s Gate Buildings, Sib, Westminster, S.W. 1, loth April, 1918.I am directed by the Minister of Reconstruction to acknowledge your letter of the 6th April (M/ Demobl/27) in which you enquire whether the Minister is prepared to concur in tho adoption of the general principle that no useless production shall be continued by the Ministry of Munitions after tho cessation of hostilities, even during the immediate transition period.In reply-, I am to state that while the Minister concurs in the general principle of discontinuing as soon as possible any production of munitions for which there is no future demand, he does so on the assumption that Mr. Churchill has in mind a scheme of demobilisation under which it is hoped, by the placing in advance of new contracts and by ensuring materials for their execution, to facilitate the transition from munitions work to other forms of production.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,.(Sgd.)     Vaughan Nash.As the second paragraph of this letter appeared to place upon the Minister of Munitions the onus of preparing &quot; a scheme of demobilisation,&quot; it was subsequently agreed with the Minister of Reconstruction that the sentence &quot; he does so on the assumption that Mr. Churchill has in mind a scheme of demobilisation, &amp;c.&quot; should be interpreted as meaning &quot;he does so on the assumption that he may rely upon Mr. Churchill&apos;s co-operation in the preparation of a scheme of demobilisation, Sec.&quot;Having obtained Dr. Addison&apos;s agreement with the important principle that the useless production of munitions should be discontinued at the earliest possible moment, the Committee proceeded to consider in greater detail the steps required for the termination of munition con-tracts at the cessation of hostilities. To appreciate the position, a brief statement is required of the action taken by the Ministry with regard to the insertion of &quot; break clauses &quot; in contracts.2. Report of the Financial Advisory Committee on &quot; Break Clauses.&quot;The Financial Advisory Committee appointed on April 27th, 1917, had included in their terms of reference the consideration of the operation of &quot; break clauses &quot; in Ministry contracts. By a remit from Sir Herbert Hambling on September 14th, 1917, the Committee were requested:  &quot; To consider and report on the forms of break clauses now in general use in Ministry contracts, and whether, and if so what, alterations should be made therein, having regard to the financial interests both direct and indirect of the State, the contractors and the workpeople : and the policy to be adopted, (a) in bringing such clauses into operation, and (6) in cases where no break clause exists.&quot;In view, however, of the appointment in November of the Committee&quot; on Demobilisation and Reconstruction, Sir Clarendon Hyde, the Chairman of the Financial Advisory Committee, noti-fied the Minister on December 12th, 1917, that his Committee had resolved to discontinue their deliberation on the operation of the &quot; break clause,&quot; and to hand over to the Demobilisation and Reconstruction Committee the evidence already taken, giving to that Committee all possible help. The Financial Advisory Committee were asked to present a report on the evidence which they had so far obtained, and on January 30th, 1918. they reported as follows :  &quot;Following the CommitteeVminute of the 12th December, 19.17, to the Minister, and in accordance with Sir Clarendon Hyde&apos;s subsequent interview with Sir Worthington Evans, the Committee are confining their report upon the above remit to the broad principles involving important financial considerations, which they are of opinion should be observed in the operation of the break clause in Ministry contracts.The Committee make the following recommendations:   1. The Minister should limit his liability under the break clause as strictly as circum-stances permit, but once the responsibility of the State has been strictly safe-guarded the Minister should interpret the clause in a liberal spirit as the case of
11819480each contractor reasonably demands. So divergent are the circumstances of different branches of industry, and of individual cases, that the application of the terms of any break clause must be varied so as to apply to individual circumstances.Full effect given to the strict letter of a strictly drawn break clause must seriously prejudice the interests of the State, the contractor and the workmen, by bringing about a general cessation of work and producing industrial chaos at a moment when steadying factors will be of the highest importance.2. No material should be wasted by being employed in unneeded manufactures. All munitions work as such should cease at the earliest possible moment, and con-tractors should be encouraged to resume their normal occupations with a minimum of unemployment and dislocation.3. Generally speaking, buildings in course of erection should, if of suitable design, location, and of substantial use for commercial purposes, be completed.4. In the application of the break clause with a principal contractor regard should be given to the application by the principal contractor of the break clauses in his contracts with sub-contractors.&quot;3. Types of Break Clause.Un the 6th February, 1918, it was decided to obtain from the Contracts Department information concerning the length of the period of production under existing break clauses and the approximate number and variations of types of such clauses in force, and to arrange for a meeting with the members of the Board of Management Executive Committee in order to discuss the termination of contracts, the question of employment after the war, and other problems that will arise on the cessation of hostilities. This meeting took place on .19th February, 1918.Apart from the power to terminate on the ground of default by the contractor, there are 1wo main types of break clause to consider :  (a) the ordinary break clause giving power to either side to terminate a running contract on specified notice being given; the period of notice varying from 14 days upwards according to the period of normal production; (6) the so-called war break clause, which is commonly additional to the above, under which the Minister of Munitions has power to terminate any contract extending over three months or upwards, whether a &quot;running contract,&quot; or a contract for a specific quantity, if the war ends or if in his opinion it is likely to end shortly.&apos;In a memorandum prepared by Sir John Mann for the Sub-Committee of the House of Serial Commons Committee on National Expenditure, and dated 10th December, 1917, the basis of No. 36. the action of the Contracts Department in the matter of the war break clause is defined as follows:  It is open to the Minister to instruct a contractor to stop deliveries under any contract and pay him compensation for the loss occasioned by the cancellation. The war break clauses have been matured with a view to defining and limiting the amount of the contractors&apos; claims where it is decided to stop supplies at the end of the war.The policy to be adopted with regard to supplies of munitions on the cessation of hostilities involves many vital considerations besides those which affect the Contracts Department. . . ,, . No responsibility lies upon the Contracts Department of the Ministry for the policy to be adopted in bringing the war break clause into operation; the duty of that Department has been to make the best bargain possible with the con-tractors in order to limit the Government responsibility. . . . The war break clauses have therefore been framed in a permissive form conveying an option to the Minister to terminate the contract but not tying the hands of the Government in any way as to the extent to which the cancellation is to be carried into effect.&apos; The break clause has been criticised, perhaps quite naturally, as if it prejudged or prejudiced the reconstruction policy. This is not so. Obviously, on the coming of peace it may be difficult to justify the expenditure, of one single shilling upon either wages or material for the manufacture of munitions of war, but it may be repeated that the war break clauses as they stand do not necessarily involve waste of money on labour and material in such futile expenditure, as their primary object is to define Government liability without prejudicing the demobilisation question. The Government may at any time extend the periods set forth in the clauses, or adopt other solutions of the problem.4. The Standard War Break Clause.The period of notice during which full production will continue under the war break Serial Nos, clause is in the majority of cases from 14 days to 4 weeks, but is extended in the case of supplies 104,112. for which the productive period is long.As regards the supplies incompleted, or not yet delivered, at the termination of the period of notice, the Minister has power.under the standard war break clause to direct the contractor either (a) to complete and deliver at a mutually agreed rate all articles actually in course ofmanufacture or, in default of agreement, at the contract rate; (6) to cease manufacture entirely. ,
MThe contractor is indemnified against commitments properly incurred tor the purpose of carrying out his contract.    It is provided :  (i) that the Minister will take over, at cost, all material and components which areunused at the expiration of the notice owing to the exercise of the power of termination;(ii) the contractor will he indemnified for purchases of material and components inrespect of the incompleted portion of the contract;(iii) the Minister will take over all articles in course of manufacture which the con-tractor shall not he directed to complete, and will pay for the same the cost of material used, together with labour and establishment charges properly applicable, and an allowance of 5 per cent, upon the total outlay. The preceding conditions are those usually attached to the standard war break clause.  There are in addition certain variants to be found in contracts of types of munitions for which the productive period is long.   In certain contracts for gun and howitzer equipments a special clause has been inserted with a view to securing that so far as possible various parts of gun equipment should not be left in an unfinished condition, or should at least be completed up to a definite stage. The number of months&apos; output at contract rate, which may be completed after notice, varies in these cases from three months for 3.7 in. howitzers up to nine months for 12 in. and 15 in. guns. Again, in some of the &quot; assisted &quot; contracts, where the Ministry supplies the plant, the war break clause gives the right to terminate at any time wit boot notice, subject to repayment of all outlays, plus 5 per cent.   In aircraft contracts the war break clause allows for:  (a) Four months&apos; output extended over six months for all aircraft engine builders,(b) Three months&apos; contract output extended over six months for aircraft contractors whoare solely aircraft contractors.(c) Two months&apos; output extended over six months for firms who have taken over aircraftwork but have other work in addition. In the case of mechanical transport, the war break clause provides for eight weeks&apos; pro-duction deliverable over a period of six months.5. Statistics of Contracts.The contracts terminable under the break clause constitute a comparatively small proportion of the total contracts placed by the Ministry, probably not more than 30 per cent. Financially, however, they cover the major part of the Ministry&apos;s contractual obligations.The total number of contracts, exclusive of sub-contracts, placed during the twelve months ending 31st March, 1918, was 62,880. It is estimated that the average life of a contract,is nearer two than three months. This would reduce the number of contracts current :at a par-ticular date to 11,500-12,000.Of the contracts placed by the Central Contracts Department during this period, the number subject to notice is estimated at 4,586, of which 2,167 are subject to a war break clause.&apos; To these totals must be added figures for contracts placed by the Explosives, Aircraft Production and Trench Warfare Departments, and by the Boards of Management. The information under these headings is somewhat inadequate. It is known, however, that only a small number of Explosive and Trench Warfare contracts contain a break clause, such contracts being in the main for fixed quantities or short periods. Board of Management contracts are as a general rule subject to notice: probably about 2,000 Board of Management contracts are alive at a given date.Making allowance for all these factors, the total number of terminable contracts in all departments of the Ministry may be estimated at 7,500, of which the number subject to a war break clause is from 3,500 to 4,000. As already stated, these 4,000 contracts, though only one-third of the total number outstanding at any one time, represent a very large proportion of the gross output of munitions and materials.6. The Termination of Contracts.After taking into consideration the various memoranda that had been prepared and cir-culated on the subject of the break clauses, and after consultation with Sir John Mann, the Controller of Munitions Contracts, and Mr. Collinson, the Controller of Inspection, the Com-mittee decided that it was necessary to make preparations in advance for the immediate termina-tion of contracts, should such a- course prove necessary. It is conceivable that the end of the war may come so gradually that it will be possible steadily to reduce the output of munitions by the operation of the existing break clauses. On the other hand, it may prove necessary to terminate a large number of contracts at a moment&apos;s notice, and definite instructions to meet this emergency should be prepared in advance. It is also possible that, in any case, contractors may prefer to bring their contracts to an immediate termination, so as to get their works clear for post-war work, rather than to have their contracts brought to an end by the normal operation of the break clauses.In the event of its proving necessary to bring contracts to an abrupt termination, it was obvious that some machinery would need to be devised in order to assess the claim of the con-tractor upon the Ministry for work done. Mr. Collinson was of opinion that his inspecting staff would be able to assist in this assessment, especially in the case of contracts for shell com-ponents. If a schedule of operations were prepared, on which could be entered the number of articles in course of manufacture at various stages, the shops could then be cleared of the material under manufacture and the extent of the claim of the contractor npon the Ministry could be calculated from the schedules. Sir John Mann saw no difficulty from the contracts point of view in this procedure, and was of the opinion that given satisfactory financial arrangements, many contractors would be glad to have their eh cleared expeditiously and their contracts terminated in the manner suggested.
1&quot;; Q1. .\ dCHAPTER VI.PREPARATIONS FOR THE RESTORATION OF INDUSTRY TO A PEACE FOOTING.1. Post-war Supply of Materials.An essential preliminary to any large scheme of transfer from war to peace production is an estimate both of the requirements of raw material of industry for peace production and of the probable supply. With a view to a preliminary investigation, the Minister of Reconstruction was informed, on November 30th, .1917, that the Ministry proposed to inquire from all Controlled Serial Nos. Establishments, particularly those connected with the engineering industries, what were their ^ an(* 2^ probable post-war demands for materials and equipment. To this Dr. Addison- ultimately agreed, and on February 7th, .1918, the following letter was accordingly issued to all Controlled Establishments : Ministry of Munitions of War, - Sir, 7th February, 1918.    SerialI am directed by the Minister of Munitions to inform you that his &quot;Department, in conjunction No, 27. with the Ministry of Reconstruction, is at present considering certain post-war problems connected Circular III. with the demobilisation and reconstruction of industry. As it appears probable that it will be necessary to continue the issue of materials on a priority basis for some time after the war, the Minister will be obliged if you will indicate for the confidential information of the Government what materials you estimate you will require, in what monthly quantities, for what purposes, and how soon after the cessation of hostilities, also details of any essential renewals of equipment.In replying to these enquiries it is important that you should state whether the whole of your estimated requirements for materials, and, if not, what portion, are needed for the manufacture of commodities for which on the cessation of hostilities you anticipate an assured and immediate demand.This enquiry is purely a cautionary measure, and must not be taken to indicate the probability of an early termination of hostilities.Your reply should be addressed to the Secretary, Ministry of Munitions of War, Whitehall Place, S.W. 1, and should be marked &quot; Post-War Materials, Room 107,&quot; on the corner of the envelope.An early reply will oblige.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)     W. Graham Greene.To Controlled Establishments.Replies were received from about 33 per cent, of the firms, but contained little material from which any definite conclusions could be drawn. Many firms stated that they had neither the time nor the staff for making a statement of any worth, and the firms who did in fact put forward an estimate of requirements made their statements so provisional, and on such incom-parable bases, that no statistical summary could be attempted.Certain conclusions of a more or less-representative character did, however, emerge. An Serial analysis of the replies showed that of 1.175 firms who were decided as to their post-war trade, No. 00. 999 needed no renewal of equipment, 168 needed partial renewal, and only 8 complete renewal. Replies from iron and steel manufacturers, iron founders, metal workers, &amp;c, showed, almost universally, complete assurance of maintaining maximum output. Ship-reoairing firms and chemical and explosives manufacturers, while anticipating that they would be fully occupied, were very uncertain of their requirements.19430 a 8Tlio Committee therefore decided in July, .1918, that a number of sub-committees should immediately be formed to consider in detail the arrangements that should be made, and the instructions that should be issued to contractors, should the occasion arise for the wholesale Serial N&apos;os. termination of contracts. Three of these sub-committees have been formed for gun ammunition, Jog&apos;^nd&apos;187 ordnance and explosive respectively, containing representatives of the Supply, Inspection and Contracts Departments, under the chairmanship of Mr. Larke. Sub-committees for ammunition boxes and mechanical transport are to follow.The sub-committee on gun ammunition contracts has already presented an interim report. In this report they desired authorisation for the insertion of a new war break clause iiwall new contracts, and so far as possible in existing contracts, for gun ammunition, empowering the Serial^ Minister, should he be of opinion that the war was likely to end shortly, to direct the contractor No. 100. to cease manufacture wholly. The condition is added that, should the Minister exercise this power, he will take over from the contractor all articles in course of manufacture at the date of the notice, and will pay for the same the cost incurred by the contractor, calculated in accorcl-ance with certain schedules of operations and costings. There is the further condition that the Minister will assume liability for any payments to employees in lieu of notice of discharge.The Committee, on September 18th, 1918, approved of this new war break clause in principle, and also directed that steps should be taken to keep the Civil War-Workers Demobilisation Committee and the Ministry of Labour informed of the action which the Ministry contemplated with regard to the termination of contracts. The Committee also considered that an early public announcement should be made as to the Governments intentions with regard to the payment of unemployment allowances during&apos; the transition period.The proposed new Avar break clause in gun ammunition contracts was referred informally to the Treasury, and they expressed the opinion that it should be considered by the newly formed Committee of the Heads of the various Contracts Departments under the chairmanship of Lord Cohvyn. The Committee, therefore, decided at their meeting on September 25th that the Colwyn Committee should be consulted before any action was taken in the matter.
If)Serial No. 28.Serial No. 05.Serial No. 179.Serial No. 13G.2. Post-war Position with regard to Steel.Tho iron and steel industry, both in view of its importance and from ihe fact that the Ministry is in practical control of it, has been the subject of special investigation. On January -iOth, 19.18, Mr. Layton was requested to prepare a memorandum, in collaboration with the Steel Department, on the probable post-war steel position. This was done, and at the meeting of February 20th the memorandum was discussed at length, especially with regard to its recom-mendations. Mr. Layton, as a result of a provisional analysis of probable post-war supply and demand, based respectively on the present supply and the pre-war demand, had come to the conclusion that there would probably be an excess even to the extent of a million tons of supply over demand.   The recommendations of the memorandum were as follows:  (a) An immediate cncpiiry into tlie probable post-war demands at home from steel-using industries,(b) Enquiry as to actual and prospective orders for steel for export.(c) Government action to absorb in public works, chiefly railways, the estimated surplus (about 1,000,000 tons).(d) Steel department to consider probable post-war demand divided into plates, sections, rails, &amp;c, for comparison with present rolling capacity.(e) To this end a Committee should be appointed consisting of three members of tho Steel Department, a member of the Ministry of Reconstruction and a representative of the Priority Department.   The suggested terms of reference were:  (i.) To examine the prospects of shipping of iron ore and to present a forecast of the probable post-war supply of iron ore. pig iron and steel; and to indicate any steps that are needed to permit this production to be made, (ii.) To consider in particular the position as regards the present Government bonus to defray the present high freights on ore imports, (iii.) To draw up a programme of home requirements of steel and to report what difficulties, ifany, there are in the way of those requirements becoming effective, (iv.) To report in a similar way on the export situation,(v.) If it appears likely that supply and demand will not balance, to put forward proposals for filling the deficiency in either supply or demand.After discussion of Mr. Layton&apos;s memorandum, it was decided by the Committee that Dr. Addison should be consulted with regard to the proposed departmental committee on the post-war steel position, and also that steps should be taken to ascertain to what extent the Central Committee on Materials Supply, appointed under the Ministry of Reconstruction, had already collected information on the subject. At an interview with Dr. Addison it was dis-covered that a committee of the Board of Trade under Mr. Percy Ashley was charged with ascertaining the probable demands for materials from home and colonial sources, and that Sir William Clark of the Department of Overseas Trade was ascertaining, neutral and allied demands. The Materials Supply Committee under Sir Clarendon Hyde was also collecting information, and Mr. Wormald was tentatively arranging engineering trade demands in a priority classification. It appeared essential to get in touch with these various bodies, and a conference was arranged for 4th March, at which Mr. Ashley, Sir W. Clark, Sir Clarendon Hyde and Mr. Wormald were present.This conference served to show that neither of the two committees referred to had advanced very far with their inquiries.   The discussion also disclosed a strong dissent on the part of Sir Clarendon Hyde from the proposition that there would probably be a surplus of steel \available immediately after the war.It was finally decided on 27th March to appoint a Steel Sub-committee, as suggested in Mr. Layton&apos;s memorandum, with the terms of reference proposed by him, and to inform Dr. Addison accordingly.The Sub-committee was constituted as follows: -Mr. W. T. Layton (Chairman), Mr. W. T. MacLellan, Mr. F. L. MacLeod, Mr. J. Peach of the Steel Department, with Mr. W. J. Larke as Secretary.The Sub-committee held 25 meetings and examined a large number of witnesses repre-senting various industrial groups interested in the production and utilisation of iron and steel.An interim report was presented at the beginning of September and was considered by the Committee at their meeting on 4th September. This report dealt mainly with the prospec-tive supply of steel during the period immediately following the war, and with the question of price and freight subsidies. The estimate of the probable demand was based largely on pre-war figures, and a more precise estimate of the prospective quantitative demands for various forms of iron and steel was deferred to a later report.One of the most interesting points that emerged during the inquiries of the Sub-committee was the fact that the Shipping Controller did not anticipate, so far as could be determined under present conditions, that shortage of tonnage would be a limiting factor at the end of the war, and he was of opinion that if required there would be tonnage available for a total import of 8,000,000 tons of foreign iron-ore during the first year after the cessation of hostilities.The main conclusions arrived at by the Committee were as follows :-  (o) The supply of imported ore during the year following the war may be anticipated to be at least 0,000,000 tons, and possibly 7,500,000 tons; an output of 20,000.000 of home ore may be expected.(b) This will give 11,000,000 to 11,750.000 tons of pig iron.(c) Allowing for exports, 7,000,000 to 7,750,000 tons of pig iron will be available for steel making.On the assumption that scrap will be plentiful and that a considerable amount of shell steel will be available for re-rolling, the quantity of finished steel should be between 8,250,000 and 9,000,000 tons.((f) A liberal assumption of the demand for steel during the first year would be 8,300,000 tons. The larger part of this demand, will become effective during the second six months. The prospective steel output is therefore considerably in excess of the probable requirements in the first six months after the war, and will probably exceed the demand for the whole year.(c) This surplus will not be realised unless the extensions now in progress are completed; without them supply and demand will about balance.
The chief recommendations put forward by the Committee were:--(I) In order to encourage the placing of orders now, the Government should proceed with the pro-paration of a scheme of post-war priority, and should announce that, they will guarantee a supply of imported ore up to 3,000,000 tons at 50s. per ton&apos;for six months after the war. ,(2) Immediate steps should he taken to investigate the financial effect on the iron and steel industries of the removal of the subsidies at present paid by the Government: all subsidies, with the exception of freight subsidies should he removed as soon as possible, and a new schedule of fixed juices should be issued.(3) Maximum prices for the immediate post-war period should be. fixed of (say)  8 1.0s. per ton for hematite pig iron and  7 per ton for basic pig iron. Licences for the export of basic pig iron should not be granted at a price less than 30s. per ton below the current price for hematite pig iron.(I) The Government should issue a statement containing prospective maximum post-war prices: thisstatement to be revised every six months. (5) Tlie Government should prepare plans for assisting the iron and steel trade to maintain fulloutput during the transition period, preferably by either themselves placing orders or enablingorders to be placed.A considerable portion of the report was devoted to the consideration of the effect of the fGovernment stibsidies in the creation of an artificial price for various forms of iron and steel. The sub-committee were agreed that the present position was unsatisfactory, and that immediate steps should be taken to establish some sort of an economic price. Simultaneously with the investigations which were being carried out by the Sub-committee, Mr. H. Guedalla, the Controller of Commercial Finance, had been instructed by Sir L. Worthington Evans to investigate and to report on the effect of the Government subsidies in the iron and steel industries. Mr. Guedalla&apos;s conclusions were practically identical with those arrived at by the Serial Sub-committee, and he also recommended that the Government subsidies should form the subject of an immediate inquiry with a view to their removal at the earliest possible moment.In view of these two independent recommendations the Committee advised the Minister that a Departmental Committee, with Treasury representation, should be set up at once to con-sider the question, and to advise when, and how, the subsidies could best be removed or modified.A Committee was accordingly set up on September 4th, and held its first meeting on ,&apos;September-.18th.Its constitution is as follows :  -Sir Clarendon Hyde (Chairman). Sir Hugh Levick (Treasury).Mr. H. Guedalla (Controller of Commercial Finance). Mr. H. J. Judd (Deputy Controller of Munitions Contracts). Mr. W. I. Larke. Mr. W. T. Laytou.Professor H. M. Macdonald (Director of Men&apos;s &quot;Wages Section). Mr. E. C. Drake (Secretary).The terms of reference are :   (1) To consider the present system of subsidies paid by the Government to the iron and steel industries, having regard to the effect on public expenditure of:  (a) their continuance during the war period;(b) their removal during the war period.(2) The effect on the iron and steel industries of the artificial conditions arising from the payment ofsubsidies and the desirability of restoring normal conditions in these industries by the removalof the subsidies as far as possible during the war period. (3) The method of their withdrawal, e.g., whether by gradual reduction of the existing amounts or bycomplete withdrawal of certain of the subsidies at different stages, or of all of the subsidiesat a definite date.(4) The effect on prices and wages of any recommendations made in clauses .1-3 inclusive, having regard to the existence of the sliding scale agreements in. tho iron and steel industries whereby wages are regulated- by the market prices of the products.3. Provision of Machine-Tools.The Committee have had under consideration at different times applications from firms for permission to order, manufacture or import machine tools required for post-war developments. N :joq Owing to the pressure of war requirements on the machine tool trade, it has been the practice of the Machine Tool Department in the past to prohibit the placing of orders for any purposes other than those connected with the conduct of the war. As a result of consultations with Mr. Iliffe, the Controller of the Machine Tool Department, instructions have now been issued to the Department to modify their practice in this respect, to the extent of allowing post-war orders to be placed, on the understanding that they must not interfere with the execution of sTerial orders for war purposes. - No. 189.The importation of sample machines, &amp;c, from the &quot;United States presents special difficulties. All orders for machine tools in that country have to be put forward to the American Board by the Machine Tool Department, with a guarantee that they are necessary for the conduct of the war.4. Use of American Materials for Peace Purposes.The case of machine tools is an extreme one, but a somewhat similar difficulty arises, in the -case of all materials, required for post-war purposes, of which supplies are obtained from the United States. An undertaking has been given by the Ministry to the War Industries&apos; Board in America on more than one occasion, that all materials, &amp;c, obtained on United States&apos; credits j^^O. are required solely for war purposes. The point has been referred to the Treasury and to the Foreign Office, and an expression of opinion has been obtained from Mr. Austen Chamberlain,
Circular II.the Chairman of the American Board and British representative on the Inter-Allied Council&apos;.. The opinion expressed by Mi&apos;. Chamberlain is that, in view of the impossibility of drawing a distinction between American and other imported materials, and of the duty of the Government to meet the civilian and economic needs of the country, the undertaking given by the Ministry would not be violated by the execution of schemes, necessarily small, for post-war development.So the matter rests at the moment.   But the position is unsatisfactory, and may give rise to difficulties and misunderstandings between ourselves and the United States Government in the-future.5. Industrial Development during the War.Serial In January, 1918, a circular was issued to the Controllers or Directors of Supply and*J.0, IJ&apos; TT    Materials Departments asking for information as to new and extended industries:  (1) a list of the new industries, whether engineering or not, which the Department had found it essential to create for the prosecution of the war; and(2) a list of the industries greatly extended for war purposes, with a brief statement shewing the extent to which these developments have been found necessary. Few departments had had to create new industries, but nearly all reported more or less important extensions. The chemical industry had started several new processes, and had greatly extended many others, e.ij., manufacture of thermometers, pyrometers and other record-ing instruments necessitating the use of chemical glass, all the best of which was previously made in the Central Empires. The manufacture of fine chemicals of reagent quality, acid resistant pottery and chemical plant had also greatly increased owing to the cutting off of German supply. Other sides of the chemical industry, such as the concentration of sulphuric acid to 95 per cent, strength, and the production of oleum, toluol, benzol and carbolic acid&apos; crystals had all been greatly extended. The production of raw materials for aeroplane dope had also been promoted.The effect of the war on the iron and steel trades had been mainly in the extension of existing, rather than the creation of new, industries. There had been an increased production of coke, pitch-coke for the manufacture of electrodes, pig-iron, refractory metals and of all kinds of bricks (some of which magnesite and coke-oven bricks used mainly to come from Germany). As regards alloy steel there had been an extended use of heat and oil treatment, and of electric furnaces for high class steels of special analyses and tests. The Mechanical Warfare Department reported the increased manufacture of small steel castings in high tensile steel (practically a new thing in England) and the heat treatment of small steel castings, also believed to be a new industry.Of non-ferrous metals the greatest development was in the manufacture of tungsten, which&apos; before the war was made in Germany from the wolfram ore produced in the British Empire. To-day the works capacity is more than sufficient to deal with all the tungsten produced from materials in the Empire, while the quality is better than even the best manufactured in Germany before the war. The manufacture of cupro-nickel steel sheet was a new industry and there had&apos; been a great development of the use of cupro-nickel alloys. There had also been a development of aluminium and spelter manufacture.Both the Mechanical Warfare and Trench Warfare Departments reported on the good effects of the war on the engineering trades.    &quot; Distinct progress has been made in workshop-methods owing to the greater accuracy and precision required in the making of munitions, e.g.&apos;. standardisation and interchangeability of parts, extended use of improved and accurate machinery, micrometers and gauges generally.&quot;CHAPTER VII.PRIORITY   CONTROL. 1. Post-war Priority.The question of priority control has received very careful consideration by the Committee., both in regard to the machinery for maintaining priority regulation, so far as necessary, during the transition period, and also with a view to facilitating under war conditions such preparatory measures for peace production as the supply of material and labour will permit.On March 18th, 1918, the Minister of Reconstruction was asked whether he was yet in a position to determine how far it would be necessary to regulate priority of production in the-Serial interests of national industry after the cessation of hostilities: whether any scheme for theNo. 47. regulation of post-war priority was under consideration, and it so, what priority classification it was proposed to adopt, particularly in connection with the products of the iron, steel, non-ferrous metals and engineering industries.A reply was received on April 5th stating that, while it was impossible to give a definite-Serial answer to these inquiries, in. Dr. Addison\s opinion it would be safest to frame plans on theNo. 77. assumption that continued control would be required. A copy of a report on the subject was-also forwarded, which had been made to Dr. Addison by the Second Section of his Advisory&apos; Council, under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Birchenough.The main recommendations in this Report were as follows: &apos;(a) Priority of allocation for materials, labour, power and transport facilities. Preference should be given to industries in the following order:-(1) Those connected with the home production of food and raw materials, in order to economise overseas transport by restricting imports.
1 9 I(2) Those connected with the manufacture of machinery and equipment of all kinds including transport-which arc immediately necessary for the re-equipment of the industry of the country as a whole.(8) Those connected with the manufacture of finished goods for export, in order to rectify foreign exchanges and to restore or maintain our position in foreign markets.(4) Those connected with the production of goods for home requirements of a pressing nature, (b) Administrative Organisation. A Cabinet Committee should bo net up, holding a position analogous to that occupied by the. War Priorities Committee, which would lay down the broad prin-ciplos of post-war priority and would be responsible for the bulk allocation of materials to various industries where a shortage of materials existed. The detailed allocation to individual firms would, as far as possible, be carried out through trade organisations. The Cabinet Committee d should fie assisted by a Standing Advisory Council, consisting of men of high position in industry and commerce, together with representatives of the Government departments concerned.On 27th April, 1918, the general agreement of the Ministry of Munitions with these Serial proposals was intimated. No. 84.On. August 2nd an announcement was made in the press by the Minister of Reconstruction, Serial with the approval of the Economic Defence and Development Committee of the War Cabinet, No. 187. on the subject of post-war priority. It was stated that the Government had decided to take immediate action on the lines of the Birch enough Report, and that it was proposed to set up a small Cabinet Committee, consisting of the President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Labour, Minister of Shipping, Minister of Munitions, and Minister of Reconstruction, with the same Chairman as the War Priorities Committee. This Committee would determine large questions of policy, and would lay down the general principles upon which any allocation and priority should proceed.The Cabinet Committee would be assisted by a Standing Advisory Council composed of members of the Departments chiefly concerned, together with persons representative of com-merce, industry and labour. The duty of the Standing Council would be to draw up a scheme of post-war priority and to consider what detailed machinery should be used for allocation, where necessary, in the transition period; to review the existing machinery of control and to consider how far it was possible to transfer the control exercised by government departments to the trade organisations which were in process of formation by the Ministry of Labour, the . Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Reconstruction.Since the date of this announcement Dr. Addison has been in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, and with various associations of employers and other representative bodies, with regard to the constitution of the Standing Advisory Council. It is anticipated that a further public announcement on the subject will be made very shortly.2. Priority to be assigned during1 the war to Work connected with Post-warDevelopments,The action described above relates in the main to the regulation of industry when the requirements for war purposes are no longer operative. It does not deal, with the more immediate problem of the extent to which preparations can be made during the war period for the re-establishment of industry on a peace footing. The importance of such preparations has heen emphasised by Lord Balfour of Burleigh&apos;s Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy, by the Civil War Workers Demobilisation Committee, by the Board of Management Advisory Panel and by other independent authorities.Any arrangements for preparatory work of this kind must; clearly be made to fit in with the existing war priority organisation, so that whatever small surplus of materials, labour or manufacturing capacity may:, prove to be available after urgent war requirements have been met, can be diverted to making preparations for the reconstruction of industry after the war.This aspect of priority regulation has been discussed by the Committee with the greatest Serial Nos. thoroughness, and various memoranda on the subject have been submitted for consideration.      94, 100, 101. From these discussions the following propositions have been established :  (a) A definite priority classification for post-war purposes - is required, which can befitted in with the existing regulations for war priority. (6) In view of the large number of applications for materials and machinery for post-war purposes which will be received, so soon as it is known that facilities for manu-facture can be obtained, it seems essential that the scheme should provide for the automatic certification of priority, by definition.A memorandum on these lines was submitted to the Committee on May 15th, 1918, by Serial the Controller of Priority. Sir Edgar Jones. The Controller stated that it was in his opinion No. 101.. possible to bring into immediate operation a scheme that would effect the above objects without disorganising the existing priority arrangements, and would offer a stimulus to the placing of orders for post-war delivery. For its effective working the scheme required a public pronounce-ment with regard to the relative grades of importance of post-war work, Ley, a statement of the priority classification that might be expected to obtain on the cessation of hostilities.A draft Amended Priority Order was therefore prepared by Mi1. Larke and submitted to the Serial Committee on June 3rd.   The Order was so designed as to give a definite priority classification No. 114. to the maintenance and conversion of industrial plant and machinery, including jigs and tools, in the United Kingdom, for whatever purpose required during the transition from war to peace industry.   The method adopted was that of a new graded classification, within Class B, Class A remaining as before.   In case of export orders, no automatic classification was given in order that  -complete control might be retained over such orders.   Neither was provision made for&apos; the automatic classification of applications for the production of samples, in view of the temptation
to accumulate commercial stocks under the shelter of this privilege, and of the fact that undue advantage would be given to some firms over others. Priority applications for the purpose of such manufacture would, therefore, be reserved for individual consideration.Accordingly,  the draft amended Order laid down the following classification under Class B:-class b comprises ; Material required wholly for or work upon a component part of orders in the following grades:   glass b, grade 5.Orders for repairs (but not for tlie replacement of existing machinery by new) essential to maintain continuity of operation of industrial plant or machinery in the United Kingdom which is for the time being mainly engaged upon the execution of orders in Class A, or of industrial plant or machinery in the United Kingdom employed in Transport (including shipping, docks, harbours, canals, railways, tramways and commercial or public vehicles), in mines and quarries, in the manufacture of iron, steel, and other metals, and coke, in the production of food, oils, dyes and fertilizers, in the supply and distribution of water, electricity, gas and other forms of power, or in sewage or drainage works.Such orders, including export orders, as the Ministry of Munitions has directed or may hereafter direct in writing to be within Class B, Grade 5, after application has been made in each case to the Controller, Priority Department, Ministry of Munitions, 1, Caxton Street, London, S.W.1. class b, grade 6.Orders for reasonable stocks of articles or materials required as component parts of articles or materials to be produced or supplied in Class A, or Class B, Grades 5 and 6.Orders for repairs (but not for replacement of existing machinery by new) essential to maintain continuity of operation of plant or machinery in the United Kingdom other than plant or machinery included in the definition of Class B, Grade 5.Such other orders, including export orders, as the Ministry of Munitions may hereafter direct in writing to be within Class B, Grade 6, after application has been made in each case to the Controller, Priority Department, Ministry of Munitions, 1, Caxton Street, London, S.W.1.Export orders, certified, in writing by the Admiralty, War Office, or the Board of Trade to be of sufficient national importance to be specially approved for export, and as to which the Minister of Munitions or other Government Department controlling the necessary materials has certified that such materials can be spared. class b, grade 7.Orders for the renewal or conversion of such industrial plant or machinery employed in the United Kingdom as is included in the definition of Class B, Grade 5.Orders for the repair and maintenance of buildings or constructional works in the United Kingdom. class b, grade 8.Orders for the renewal or conversion of plant or machinery employed in the United Kingdom other than plant or machinery included in the definition of Class B, Grade 5. class b, grade 9.Orders for such new or additional industrial plant or machinery, to be employed in the United Kingdom, as is included in the definition of Class B, Grade 5. class b, grade 10.Orders for such new or additional plant or machinery, to be employed in the United Kingdom, as is not included in the definition of Class B, Grade 5. class b, grade 11.Such orders as are not included in the definition of Class B, Grades 5 and 10, if authority to place them in Class B, Grade 11, shall have been previously obtained from the Controller, Priority Department, Ministry of Munitions.This scheme cannot become operative until the present steel orders are modified so as to enable manufacturers to issue their own priority certificates for this essential material.A further scheme for the priority classification of individual applications, which could not readily be covered by the proposed automatic classification, was prepared by Mr. Larke and submitted to the Committee on July 8th.A copy of the draft Amended Priority Order was forwarded to Dr. Addison on June 12th. Emphasis Was laid in the covering letter on the desirability of securing an automatic basis for priority certification, if this was by any means possible, in order to avoid the setting up of a special organisation to deal with the large number of applications that might be expected. It was further pointed out that &quot; careful consideration would need to be given to the effect that such publication (i.e., a public announcement with regard to. post-war priority) might have on the understanding, which exists between our own and the United States Government, that materials supplied on credits provided by the United States are required, and are to be used, solely for war purposes.&quot; In the meantime, so Dr. Addison was informed, pending a decision as to publication, the Priority Department of the Ministry of Munitions proposed to apply the principles underlying the Draft Order to individual applications that might be referred to them for materials and facilities for post-war development.Beyond this point the Committee can for the present take no action. Further progress with the scheme must await the appointment of the Cabinet Post-War Priority Committee and of
4 q n 1(jCHAPTER VIII. LABO UR DEMOBILISATION.1. General Considerations.Since the Ministry of Munitions is itself a temporary Department, whose main function is the supply of military stores and equipment to the army, it has been recognised throughout that the Minister cannot assume responsibility for the reinstatement of labour in civil work, or for framing plans to effect this object. The responsibility on all matters affecting the national policy with regard to labour after the war, including such questions as the fulfilment of pledges for the restoration of trade union practices, the treatment of diluted labour, the preparation of safeguards against unemployment, and the like, rests with the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister of Labour.One side issue to the Treasury agreement with regard to the suspension of trade union practices during the war, has a direct bearing upon some of the reconstruction problems which have been considered by the Committee. According to the strict interpretation of the agree-ment, diluted labour cannot be employed during the war on the manufacture of machinery or tools required for post-war development. Dr. Addison&apos;s attention has been drawn to this on more than one occasion, and it has been suggested to him that some understanding on the point should be arrived at with the principal trade unions, The point at issue is bound up with the introduction of the Amending Bill to the Munitions of War Acts, which Dr. Addison has under consideration, as it is considered that the trade unions would not be willing to make any bargain as to the employment of diluted labour on post-war work until the Bill, which is intended to give legislative force to tlie outstanding Government pledges, has been passed into law.One of the chief problems with which Dr. Addison and the Minister of Labour are con-fronted is that of making arrangements in advance for the reinstatement of demobilised soldiers and for the transfer of civil industrial workers from war to peace trades. A Committee, known as the Civil War Workers Committee, has had under consideration for some time the latter aspect of the problem.    Its terms of reference are :  &quot; To consider and report upon the arrangements which should be made for the demobolisation of workers engaged during the war in National Factories, Controlled Establishments land in other firms engaged in the production of munitions of war and on Government contracts, or in firms.where substitute labour has been employed for the duration of the war.&quot;The representatives of the Ministry of Munitions upon this Committee are Mr. H. Wolfe and Mr. J. A. Barlow.   It has already presented five interim reports, in the second of which Serial Noa. the Committee recommend the adoption of a system of State unemployment insurance during ^8 and 197 the transition period.The Council Committee on Demobilisation and Reconstruction have obtained, and have forwarded to Dr. Addison, a considerable amount of information bearing on the two following aspects of the general problem of the demobilisation of civil war-workers :(a) the extent to which firms, though employed on war work, are in effect engaged ontheir normal standard production, and can therefore be expected to turn over to peace industry with little or no dislocation:(b) the probable state of employment at the end of the war in the metal and chemicaltrades, over which the Ministry of Munitions has most direct control. These are briefly dealt with in the two following sections.2. Degree of Identity between War and Peace Industry.At a meeting with the Boards of Management Executive Committee on 19th February, Serial 1918, it was suggested that the problem of demobilisation could most conveniently be approached No 34. by considering separately the volume of labour now engaged upon its normal peace-time pro-duct, as compared with the labour not so employed.   It was estimated by Mr. H. Mensforth of the Manchester Board of Management, that in his district, at any rate, the former amounted to no less than two-thirds of the total, so far as engineering trades were concerned.The same point was dealt with at a later date by Mr. A. H. Hardisty, General Manager Serial of the Huddersfield National Shell Factory.  In a letter to Sir James Stevenson on 20th June, No. 133. 1918, he gave the result of an analysis he had made of the engineering works in the Huddersfield District.   According to this analysis, nearly 90 per cent, of the firms were engaged on what was more or less their normal standard production, though in an intensified form owing to war -conditions.These estimates, though merely representative of particular districts and not applicable to industry as a whole, afford some ground for hoping that the dislocation caused by the return to peace conditions may not be so serious as is generally supposed.the Standing Advisory Council referred to in the first section of this chapter. The proposals submitted to Dr. Addison by the Ministry of Munitions Demobilisation Committee will no doubt form one of the earliest matters for consideration by the Advisory Council, and until their views have been obtained no public announcement on the subject can be made.
3. Probable state of Employment in the Metal and Chemical Trades at the end ofthe War.A careful statistical computation, based on an analysis of employment figures in munition industries, was undertaken during the early part of the year with a view to estimating the probable displacement after the war of two large groups of workers, (a) those who will he thrown out of work almost immediately after the cessation of hostilities&apos; from the body of workpeople now engaged on the manufacture of destructive munitions, and (b) those persons who have during the war been drawn into industries&apos;as &quot; dilutees,&quot; and who will have to be displaced if the pledges given to the Trade Unions as to the restoration of pre-war trade practices are rigidly carried out.A memorandum on this subject was sent to the Minister of Reconstruction on 2nd May. Taking the returns for October, 1917, as the basis, it was shown that there were at that time 2,228,000 males and 878,000 females employed in the chemical and metal trades, roughly 90 per cent, of whom were employed on Government work. Of these 3,106,000 workpeople, 691,000 males and 524,000 females were employed in the manufacture of military stores, such as guns, shells, aeroplanes, &amp;c, while 1,537,000 males and 354,000 females were employed in the manufacture of goods which could be used or adapted for peace purposes, such as ships, iron, steel and other materials, machinery, hardware, &amp;c, &amp;c.A provisional estimate gives 180,000 males and 65,000 females as the numbers of work-people who may continue to find employment on munitions proper after the war; these totals include one-half of the numbers employed in aircraft production. The probable displacement of labour of persons employed on munition work proper thus becomes 511.000 males and 459,000 females. &apos;Of the 1,537,000 males and 354,000 females employed in the manufacture of goods that can be used for peace purposes, the vast majority aie, of course, employed upon work subsidiary to the manufacture of munitions proper. Assuming, however, that the substitution of private orders for Government orders is satisfactorily arranged, and that suitable provision of raw materials, banking credit and the like is available, these persons will not necessarily suffer more than some temporary breach of the continuity of their employment, except in so far as the Trade Unions insist upon the expulsion of dilutees from occupations in which they are engaged. As the pledges to the Trade Unions stand at present, all dilutees must leave their occupation after the conclusion of hostilities, and since it must be supposed in order to arrive at a maximum figure of possible unemployment, that the pledges will be strictly adhered to, it has been necessary to base the estimate on the assumption that all dilutees in the metal trades will have-to change their occupation.The term &quot; dilutee &quot; is susceptible to various interpretations, each of which has a limited acceptance. In this memorandum it has been assumed that all the males are dilutees who have been drawn into the various industries since July, 1917, either to replace men called to the colours or as a net addition to the number previously employed. This method of calculation clearly gives a, maximum figure. Women dilutees are taken as these engaged upon work which would normally be performed by men. The dilutees employed in the manufacture of goods that can be used for peace purposes are according to these definitions 514,000 males and 112,000 females.The final estimate of the number of workpeople in munition trades who will have to change their occupation at the end of the war may be summarised as follows:  Engaged on making destructive munitions: Males. Females.Dilutees.........     ...      ......     410,000 285,000Others       .......     ............     101,000 174,000Engaged on other Government work in munition trades of a nature that can be used or adapted for civilian purposes:Dilutees     ...     ...............     514,000 112,000.1,025,000 571,000It would therefore appear that on the conclusion of hostilities, about 1,000,000 persons employed upon munitions proper will have to seek fresh employment, rather more than half of these being males. In addition to these totals 500,000 male and upwards of 100,000 female dilutees will have to change their occupation at the end of the war if the trade union pledges are completely enforced. The above estimates are based on the figures of employment for October, 1917, and the conditions have probably been substantially modified since that date by the development of certain branches of munition manufacture, and also by the operation of the Military Service Act (No. 2), 1918.
PART III-PREPARATIONS FOR DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY.CHAPTER IX.RECORDS OF LAND AND PROPERTY BELONGING TO, THE MINISTRY.1. Retrospective.Down to the end of 1916 negotiations for the acquisition of land were conducted through the agency of the Lands Branch of the War Office, exercising the powers in regard to land conferred upon the competent naval or military authority by Regulation 2 of the Defence of the Realm Act.In August, 1916, Sir George Holmes had been charged to prepare a statement of factories other than ordnance factories, and of other properties owned and managed by the Ministry through the Director-General of Munitions Supply, with details as to their plant and equipment, and similar statements were to be prepared by the Explosives and Trench Warfare Departments.On 25th January, .1917, a -Joint Lauds Department of the War Office and Ministry of Munitions, was established to deal with the acquisition of land, questions of compensation, valuation, &amp;c, and to compile records.In April, .1917, a special committee of the Munitions Works Board, known as the Special Committee for Lands and Buildings, with Sir Howard Frank as Chairman and Major Tudsbery as Secretary, was set up (General Memorandum 3) by the Munitions Works Board, which had absoi-bed the &quot; Survey and Valuation&quot; Branch of the Controlled Establishments Division. This Committee was made responsible for the preparation of a list of factories and other buildings erected and taken over by the Ministry. It was further charged with the compilation of a schedule of the Ministry&apos;s lands; reporting for this purpose to the Lauds Department.In July, .1917, the Finance Department raised the question as to the policy to be adopted in regard to plant and machinery, the property of the Ministry, which was in the hands, of the contractors. It was pointed out by the Director-General of Munitions Contracts on 25th July. 1917, that the greater part of the plant and buildings belonging to the Ministry formed part of establishments owned by private contractors who have assisted contracts, and it was suggested that arrangements should be made with such contractors to take over immediately the plant and buildings under their control. It was understood that the plant and buildings belonging to the national factories would be amply sufficient for all government requirements after the war.Sir James Stevenson, on the 30th August, 1917, suggested that the Lands Branch should prepare a list of plant and machinery in the hands of contractors, and that the general policy should then be formulated by the Ministry of Reconstruction as to (he sale to contractors of Ministry property, or other methods of disposal.Sir Howard Frank was accordingly invited on 3.1st August, 1917, to prepare such a list, but by Generol Memorandum No. 24, issued on .10th September, 1917, instructions were given to all Supply Departments of the Ministry to arrange for the preparation of inventories of all plant, machinery, furniture, &amp;c, in national factories or in the hands of contractors which were the property of the Ministry or which might become the property of the Ministry, or over which the Ministry had some lien. Inventories when compiled were to be supplied to the Inventories -Section of the Finance Department M.F. 613, under Mr. H. Wingfield.Early in December, 1917, the Special Committee for Lands and Buildings became a Sub-Gommittee of the Standing Committee of the Munitions Council for Demobilization and Recon-struction, which had recently been appointed. Their terms of reference were extended to include responsibility for preparing schedules and valuations of machinery and other property belonging to the Ministry, and for making recommendations for the disposal of Ministry property when required (General Memorandum 47). In particular the Committee was instructed to report on the capabilities of such machinery for post-war work.The Special Committee is constituted as follows:   Sir Howard Frank, K.C.B. (Chairman). Mr. A. Yirgoe Buckland, O.B.E. Col. H. C. Cole, C.B.E. Lt.-Col. H. St. J. Cooke, D.S.O. Major the Hon. L. H. Cripps, C.B.E. Major F. C. T. Tudsbery, O.B.E. (Secretary).2. Records of Property.The first printed index giving a schedule of properties belonging to the Ministry of Munitions was issued by the Special Committee in July, 1917, in which lands and buildings were arranged under headings of (a) Supply Departments and (6) under towns and districts. The list was re-issued in January, 1918, and included information as to more than 600 separate properties. By June, 1918, schedules, with plans, &amp;c, had been prepared in respect of 530 of these properties. A brief summary of this information has been duplicated and is. known as the &quot; Property Records Summary.&quot;With a view to carrying out the work- of valuing and reporting the Special Committee decided to instruct valuers and surveyors of high standing in the various districts to report upon particular groups of factories, these reports being subsequently checked by the headquarters stuff. The United Kingdom is -divided for this purpose into 23 areas, each. being under the -charge of a single valuer.   The work has, however, been delayed owing to the absence of
Serial Nos. 154, 155.Serial Nos. 93, 111, 116.Serial No. 181.information respecting, agreements affecting the property, such as grants of way-leave or options to purchase, the information at the disposal of tho Committee in these respects being defective. A further consideration affecting post-war value is the continuance of existing railway facilities, and the post-war ownership of siding connections constructed for the Ministry. This point is being considered by a special inter-departmental Committee.Some progress has been made with regard to the surveys of National Factories. In respect of assisted firms, however, the work is more backward. In certain important cases, such as Messrs. Sir W. Armstrong, Whitworth &amp; Co., no information has been received.As regards the work of compiling inventories of plant and machinery, which was coni-meneed in January, 1918, the greatest difficulty lias been experienced in obtaining inventories sufficiently detailed to enable a reliable Valuation to be fixed, and still more in keeping such inventories up to date.The inadequacy of the records of movement of plant and machinery belonging to the Ministry came to the notice of the Committee, and they decided that the most energetic steps should lie taken to bring&apos;, and to maintain, these inventories up to date.On the 4tli June, .1918, a conference of representatives of the Finance, Central Stores, Salvage and Reconstruction Departments, was summoned by the Financial Secretary to consider tins question They recommended that the responsibility for maintaining the inventories of plant and machinery belonging to the Ministry should rest with the Engineering Department under the Council Member for Ordnance. This decision was confirmed by the Council Committee on Demobilisation and Reconstruction on July 3rd, Sir Howard Frank duly concurring in the new procedure. It is hoped that a reliable record of Ministry properly in plant and machinery will therefore before long be available. Such a record is needed not only to protect the Ministry from loss, but also in order that some estimate may be formed of the mechanical resources at the disposal of the Government for purposes of reconstruction.The Munitions Works Board was instructed in April, 1918, to prepare and maintain a Register of Available Factories. This register is intended to furnish particulars of all factories either unemployed or not fully employed, whether belonging to the Ministry or to private owners. (General Memorandum 79.) Flans for the construction of a new factory cannot be proceeded with until the Board are satisfied, by an examination ol the register, that suitable accommodation is not already available.3. Valuation.By the arrangements explained in the preceding section, responsibility for valuation of machinery still remained with the Special Committee. The valuation of Ministry property in contractors&apos; works has raised several important questions of principle.It has been decided that allowances for depreciation should be made as if there were a normal market for the sale, the principle underlying assessed values being that the desire of the Government to dispose of its property constituted no valid reason for such a low scale of prices us would be refused by any private firm. In deciding the value of machinery supplied under assisted contracts it has, therefore, been laid down by the department that, although the contracting firm should make the first offer for the Ministry&apos;s machinery installed in their works, they should be made to realise that they could not offer only scrap value for everything. It should also be pointed out that although the war price of American machinery was about .100 per cent, above the peace time level, and of English about 60 per cent., nevertheless post-war juices would certainly be at least 50 per cent, above the pre-war level. Depreciation therefore should be calculated not on the pre-war price of the machine, but on a price increased 50 per cent. This, of course, would only apply to machines for which there is always a demand ; those specially designed for the manufacture of shell would need to be assessed on a different basis. It was, however, conceded that if a contractor made a reasonable offer, even though under valuation price, it would be well to accept, or, conversely, that the Ministry should not demand the last farthing of value and thereby risk loss of sale.Another aspect of the valuation question was raised by an application from Messrs. Vickers that they should be allowed to buy the Government extensions to their works at a price based&apos; on the rate of depreciation on their capital expenditure since 1911, which had been allowed by the Advisory Council to the Board of Inland Revenue for the purpose of Excess Profits assess-ment. On this assessment the residual value of the extensions to Messrs. Vickers Works bad been written down to 23f per cent. Messrs. Vickers stated that they were prepared to accept this valuation, which was held by some of the Finance Officers of the Ministry to be generous to the firm, but only on condition that the Inland Revenue valuation was accepted as the market&apos; price of the extensions paid for by the Government, should the firm desire to purchase them.The point was referred to the Treasury for decision in two letters dated May 3rd and June-13th.   The reply from the Treasury, dated September 5th, laid down the ruling that, in the opinion of Their Lordships, any negotiations for the sale of the Government extensions in question should be undertaken independently, so far as practicable, of the Inland Revenue-valuation.Serial So. 76.CHAPTER X. DISPOSAL   OF   SURPLUS   GOVERNMENTPROPERTY.1. Disposal of surplus Stores and Machinery by the Ministry of Munitions.The principal development in relation to the disposal by the Ministry of surplus stores and machinery has been the establishment in May, 1918, of a special Surplus Stores Department under Mr. W. H. Webbe as Assistant Controller, responsible for all arrangements connected
with the routine disposal of surplus stores, and for centralising all information relating thereto, in order to assist the transaction of business between the Ministry and other government depart-ments dealing with these quesions (General Memoranda 78 and \)2). The steps leading up to this departure may he briefly recounted :On 17th May, 1917, a conference was held at I)ean&apos;s Yard, attended by Mr. K. S. Montagu, -Chairman of the Central Reconstruction Committee, in the Chair, Sir Reginald Brade, Sir Graham Greene, Sir James Stevenson, and Mr. Vaughan Nash. The conference agreed to recommend that the Ministry of Munitions should undertake the disposal of government stores, together with lands and buildings but not ships and that this work should be carried out through an Executive Committee working in close connection with the Stores Department o:&amp; the Ministry, and advised by a panel of hush)ess men. It was decided that the assent of the Government should, be sought to these proposals.On 5tli June, 1917, the War Cabinet endorsed the principle of setting up a single authority to dispose of surplus property and stores, and agreed that the Stores Department of the Ministry of Munitions should form the nucleus, together with representatives of the War Office and Admiralty.The Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Munitions discussed the scheme on .15th, Kith, 18th and 21st June, .1917, and made proposals as to immediate pro6edure.A conference called by the Central Reconstruction Committee on 5th July, 1917, was tattended by Sir Frederick Black and Sir James Stevenson, as representing the Ministry of Munitions, and resulted in some divergence of view as to the degree of responsibility which was to rest with the Executive Stores Branch of the Ministry of Munitions and the relation of the Ministry to other government departments.On 28th August, 1917, an inter-departmental conference was held, attended by:   Sir James Stevenson, in the Chair. Sir Graham Greene. Sir Howard Frank. Mr. Garnsev. Mr. Gill.Mr. Ash down, ) ,. . 7  -Air Clark       i rel)iesen&quot;llS&apos; tne Admiralty.Sir Reginald Brade, \ ,.    .,   T1T   rKlllMajor-General Sir Charles Hadden, J presenting the War Office.The following resolution was unanimously adopted:  &quot; That this Conference, representing the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Ministry of Munitions, is of the opinion that in view of the absence of the necessary provision in the Act constituting the Ministry of Reconstruction it will probably be found desirable to ask Parliament to appoint a Commission with statutory powers to deal with the subject of the disposal of surplus war material and other property, but, in the meantime, owing to the urgency of the need for a body with authority to act at once, it recommends the Minister of Reconstruction to ask the Prime Minister to appoint an Executive Committee, consisting of a man with wide commercial experience as Chairman, two business men, and one member to be nominated by the Admiralty, one by the War Office, one by the Ministry of Munitions, and one by the Treasury, the terms of reference to be:  &quot; To consider and prepare schemes for the sale and disposal of land, buildings, war material and other property real or personal of all descriptions which the various departments of Government may certify to be available for disposal through the agency of the Committee in consequence of the war, and to carry out on behalf of such departments the sale a&apos;nd disposal thereof.&quot;This resolution was communicated to the Ministry of Reconstruction who replied on the &apos;5th September, pointing out that the proposed work fell into two portions (a) advisory, (b) executive. As to the former, Dr. Addison proposed to set up a representative advisory body; .as to the latter, he asked that&quot; Mr. Churchill should appoint an Executive Committee, constituted in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet, to take the action required for the disposal of any property reported to them by this department.&quot; On September 21st the constitution of the Executive Board was notified to the Treasury, Admiralty, War Office and Board of Trade, with terms of reference as follows:  &quot;To carry out such arrangements as they may deem advisable for the disposal of everything which may be assigned to them for the purpose by the Minister of Recon-struction or by the Advisory Council acting on his behalf.&quot; The proposed terms of reference for the Advisory Council were communicated to the Ministry of Munitions on the 20th September as follows:  &quot; To expedite the preparation of.* any necessary inventories of property and goods of all descriptions held by Government departments, and to consider and advise upon the disposal or alternative form of use of any property or goods which have or may become during or on the termination of the war, surplus to the requirements of any department for the purposes of that department.&quot; At this time it was clearly understood that land and buildings were to fall within the reference of the Executive Board and Advisory Council.This view, however, was challenged by the Treasury, who further held that executive action should remain with individual departments on the following grounds, which were stated in a letter to the Ministry of Munitions on 31st October, 1917:  &quot; The dominant considerations appear to the Lords Commissioners to be that the statutory powers of the Ministry of Reconstruction are to consider and advise and to make
recommendations but not to carry them into force: that the Ministry of Munitions is a temporary department and not part of the permanent executive machinery of Govern-ment: that the War Cabinet Minute No; 157 only covers stores and not Government pro-perty in general (e.g., ships, land, &amp;c): and that it is essential to preserve so far as practicable the responsibility of the various public departments, their Parliamentary Chiefs and their Accounting Officers for realising to the best advantage receipts from property in their charge.&quot; Mr. Bonar Law, on 19th January, .19.18, endorsed this latter view : &quot; I do not think we can by administrative action entirely abrogate the responsibility which now rests on individual Ministers in respect of the disposal of the property of their respective departments.&quot;On 14th December, 1917, Dr. Addison made application to the War Cabinet, asking per-mission. to publish his letter to Lord Salisbury appointing him Chairman of the Advisory Council. The letter was approved, subject to the proviso that the Dominions were to be kept informed of opportunities for acquiring property accumulated by Government, but the War Cabinet definitely withdrew Government factories from the purview of the special organisation. (Vide Minutes No. 298.)&quot;The War Cabinet therefore decided that Government factories and shipping should he treated as a separate subject offer consideration by experts, and proposals he submitted later by the Minister of Reconstruction.&quot;2. Advisory Council and Executive Board for the Disposal of Surplus GovernmentProperty.In view of the difficulties as to the responsibility of individual Ministers for the stores of their respective departments, the Treasury on 1st February, 1918, asked that both the Advisory Council and Executive Board should be appointed by Order in Council and he responsible to the Cabinet as a whole, individual Ministers retaining certain responsibilities in regard to individual transactions. An Order in Council was accordingly issued on the 4th March, 1918, creating the Advisory Council and the Executive Board.In response to the request Of the Advisory Council that a departmental staff should be set up to act under the direction of the Executive Board, the Ministry of Munitions pointed out, in a letter dated 8th March, 1918, that the Order in Council did not give the Board authority to deal with stores which were the property of the Ministry.The Order in Council was in fact merely declaratory, and while defining in general terms the functions of the Advisory Council and Executive Board and their constitution, did not in fact determine their membership or their exact powers. The matter was thus in abeyance pending the issue of a Treasury Minute, under the authority of which the Council and Board would operate. A draft Treasury Minute was submitted on 24th April, .1918, which declared the duties of the Council to he as follows:  To collect information as to stores, land and property under the control of Govern-ment departments, and likely to become &quot;surplus to its requirements&quot;; to expedite the preparation of inventories; to receive reports of surplus property and advise as to the manner of disposal. It was further laid down that no Government department should dispose of property without first reporting and receiving recommendations from the Council.The duties of the Disposal Board were to undertake the disposed in accordance with the recommendations of the Council; and to obtain and supply information relative to . property which, has been reported as surplus; and to advise on questions of value.Discussion showed the necessity for closer definition of the functions of these two bodies and their relation to ministerial authority. (A revised draft of the minute, dated June, 1918, attempted to find a solution by placing the Minister of Reconstruction in charge of the organisation, and deleting the provision which had previously been included to the effect that any member of the Executive Board who found himself unable to concur in executive action might refer to the Minister in charge of the depart-ment by which he had been nominated. The executive authority thus conferred upon the Minister of Reconstruction necessarily raised the question of the limits of his constitutional rights under the Act setting up the Ministry of Reconstruction.A fresh draft of the minute, dated July, 1918, substituted the President of the Board of Trade, for the Minister of Reconstruction, thus bringing the work under the authority of a per-manent department of State,A conference wTas held with Sir Albert Stanley, at the Board of Trade, on the 18th July, attended by Sir John Bradbury, Sir L. Worthington Evans, Sir Graham Greene, Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith, and Sir William Marwood, at which the difficulties inherent in the proposed: transfer of all surplus stores to one department were discussed. Sir L. Worthington Evans-pointed out the difficulties that would be presented by handing over innumerable small articles and materials in course of manufacture, and the impossibility of separating the disposal of stores from the adjustment and termination of contracts, especially in the case of semi-manu-factured products. There might, however, be an advantage in dealing centrally with certain completed articles and saleable stores, such as motor vehicles, railway plant and the like.Sir Albert Stanley, suggested that a definition of surplus stores should be. drawn up which would serve as a basis for such a classification, leaving uncompleted stores and details to be disposed of by the department whose property they were, unless that department wished to hand them over to the Central Disposal Board.Since this conference with Sir Albert Stanley no further progress has been made in the direction of defining the exact functions of the Advisory Council and of the Executive Board.
Although the question has now been under discussion for nearly eighteen months it has so far proved impossible to arrive at any form of agreement between the various departments interested. In the meantime the Surplus Stores Department of the Ministry is proceeding with the disposal of surplus and obsolete stores in the possession of the Ministry. It is hampered, however, in the task of overtaking the large arrears of work by the uncertainty that exists with regard to the arrangements that may eventually be made for the collective disposal of surplus Government property.3, Disposal of Surplus fiiled Ammunition.In January, 11)18, the question was raised by Brigadier-General L. C. 1\ Miinian of the arrangements to be made for the post-war disposal of surplus filled gun ammunition.   A sub-committee consisting of General Miliuttn a,s Chairman, Dr. T. Martin Lowry, Lieut.-Col. .11. jj?J^Ja Luhrs, and Lieut.-Col. J. B. Ramsden was appointed to consider the matter.   The interim terms of reference were as follows :  To consider and. report on:  (a) The length of life of amatol-filled shell.(6) The commercial aspect of breaking down filled ammunition, and the manner in which this should be done.It was decided that the larger technical questions arising out of the&apos; sentencing and storage of ammunition should be reserved for later consideration with the assistance of representatives of the Design and Inspection Departments, and of the War Office.On 6th April an interim report was submitted, enclosing a memorandum prepared by the -Serial Superintendent of Research, Woolwich Arsenal, on. the life of amatol-filled shells, kept under No* 7^ service conditions, and of cartridges filled with cordite and N.C.T., and filled fuzes and gaiues. The general trend of the report was to show that these stores would remain serviceable for periods of from four to twelve years, or even longer. As this memorandum dealt largely with technical points it was referred to the Controller of Munitions Design for consideration. It was also reported by the sub-committee that a War Office Committee, under the chairmanship of Col. Home, Commandant of the Ordnance College, Woolwich, was engaged on the investigation of the value of explosives as fertilisers. In order to prevent overlapping in these two inquiries, which were being carried on simultaneously by the War Office and by the Ministry of Munitions, it was decided to nominate Major Frye and Dr. T. Martin Lowry to represent the Ministry on the War Office Committee.On 1st August the sub-committee presented a final report dealing mainly with the cominer- Serial cial aspect of breaking down filled ammunition.   They pointed out that the question whether or 1 0l not it might prove a profitable undertaking to break down surplus ammunition after the war would depend on. the then commercial value of the materials recovered and on the quantities to be handled.   The sub-committee in reporting on this question made the following assumptions :   lions :  (a) That after all requirements for storage are satisfied there will be a surplus equal to 8 weeks stock of B.L. ammunition, together with 10,000,000 rounds of Q.F. ammunition, and 10,000,000 brass fuzes.(6) That the scrap value of shell bodies, including driving bands and nose bushes will be  5 per ton.(c) That ammonium nitrate as a fertiliser will have a value of , 20 per ton.(d) That T.N.T. being a drug on the market may not realise more than  20 per ton.-(e) That the cost of recovery of T.N.T. and ammonium nitrate from filled shell will be  6 per ton of amatol.On these assumptions the Committee estimated that The B.L. ammunition will yield:   240,000 tons scrap metal, worth        ............      850,00024,0ou tons explosives, worth...............      255,000The Q.F. ammunition will give: -5,000,000 H.E. shell bodies; 2,000 tons explosives; 5,000,000 shrapnel shell bodies; shrapnel bullets; 10,000,000 brass cartridge cases, value        ...      ...      ...    .1,150,000Less cost of breaking down, recoveryand transport       ........&quot;.       700,000Net value......      450,000The brass fuzes will give net value     ............      200,000Total   ....... 1,755,000No estimate has been included in the above for the erection of special plant, since the plant now being provided for immediate requirements should be capable of dealing with the above quantities within a period of 18 months or two years.The important fact established in the report of General Milnian\s Committee is that the breaking down of field ammunition can, if considered desirable, be profitably undertaken as a commercial proposition on the cessation of hostilities.The papers have now been referred to the Council Member for Design, to consider, in con-sultation with the military authorities, whether it is desirable that the Ordnance Committee
should initiate climatic and other trials to establish more precisely the probable length, of life of filled ammunition of modern, types. This is a service question which is of importance in arriving at a decision with regard to the stocks of filled ammunition that could with advantage be retained on. the cessation of hostilities. It is understood that the Council Member for Design proposes to initiate the necessary investigations without delay.CHAPTER XI. DISPOSAL 01: NATIONAL FACTORIES. 1. General Survey of the Problem.On December .18th, .1917, Dr. Addison raised the question of the disposal, of the National Factories, asking for a declaration, of policy from the Ministry on this point. At that time the inventory of Ministry property was not complete and no detailed recommendations could be made, although the broader aspects of the problem, had been frequently discussed by the Committee. In. March and April, however, reports were drawn up, based upon and embodying the recommendations of the various Supply Departments as to the disposal of the factories in their charge and the probable dislocation of labour involved by the discontinuance of the manufacture of munitions.Reports were prepared on these lines relating to different groups of factories and were forwarded to the Minister of Reconstruction.   On the basis of these sectional surveys a general summary was prepared on June 21st, bringing together the results of the detailed reports. The main conclusions arrived at in these various reports were as follows :  The term national factory was taken to include either (a) factories directly managed and controlled by the Ministry of Munitions, or (b) those in which the wages and other outgoings were paid by the Ministry although the factories might be managed by private firms under some form of agency agreement. The factories might be classified in four groups as follows (a) Those &quot;which might be permanently retained for post war use as munition factories, either wholly or in part. Of these there were about 16-20 (apart from Royal Ordnance Factories).(6) Those suitable for eventual disposal or use as industrial concerns; of these there were about 85.(c) Factories not suitable for industrial purposes but required during the transition periodfor storage, &amp;c.; of these there were about 25. Some of the large filling factories were included in this class.(d) Factories and establishments reverting to their original owners and pre-war uses onor soon after the cessation of hostilities; of these there were about 115. The general recommendations as to the policy to be pursued in the dismissal of labour were as follows:  (a) That on the cessation of hostilities the workpeople no longer required should be given notice terminating their employment. Where they could be dispensed with immediately, one week&apos;s pay in lieu of notice should be given and the workpeople told to seek other employment.(6) The order of discharge should be:  (1) Those not dependent on their earnings.(2) Those living away from, home; in which case railway fares should be allowed. (3) Local workpeople without dependents.(4) The remainder, if possible, in such order that those most likely to obtain work should be first discharged.It was pointed out that the skilled and semi-skilled men, being largely employed in engineer-ing industries, would probably experience little or no difficulty in finding other work. The chief unemployment would be among women, particularly if the Trade Unions insisted upon a strict fulfilment of the Government pledge that the employment of women on work previously done by men would be limited to the duration of the war.The recommendations regarding the main groups of factories may be briefly summarised :-Explosive Factories. With the exception of those recommended for retention as National Explosive Factories the Department advocated the disposal of the factories either to managing firms or in the open market and indicated the industries for which each plant would be most suitable. As regards labour it was reckoned that many of the men would in the event of private firms taking over the National, factories, remain in employment under the new owners, and that the skilled builders would probably soon be absorbed by the building trade which might be expected to be active at once. Discharge of labour would be extended over a period of three months.National Shell Factories.-It was recommended that all these factories should be returned to their owners as soon as possible, but not before arrangements had been made for disposal of the plant, which, however, is expected to be only of scrap value. The labour would all be discharged in about one month.National Projectile Factories. It was anticipated that in many cases it would be possible to conclude arrangements with the managing firms to take over the factories. It was expected that a large proportion of the labour would at first be discharged, although it might ultimately be absorbed again by the new management.
126National Filling Factories. These are unsuitable for industrial purposes but should Serial be maintained as long as needed for storage of Government material, and subsequently, No. 69. where suitable, for camps.   In other cases they might be dismantled and the sites used for housing schemes.   Almost all the labour is unskilled and could be discharged within a few weeks.Trench Warfare Factories. It was recommended that the more permanent build- Serial ings most&apos;of which have been taken over under the Defence of the Realm Act should No. HO. revert to their original owners, and that the temporary erections should be used as long as needed for stores and then dismantled.   It was anticipated that the labour, most of which is unskilled, would be discharged gradually.Ordnance Factories. Apart from the factories which it might be desirable to retain Serial its National Ordnance factories, it was recommended that negotiations be entered into No. 81. either with the managers or with neighbouring firms for their disposal.   Owing to the nature of the work the discharge of labour would be gradual and there should be no great unemployment among the men.National Aircraft Factories.-An many of these factories were in course of erection Serial Nos when reported on, it seemed too early to determine their ultimate disposal.     It was 117 and 120. possible that some might be retained as national establishments.   There were also certain factories whose status was not yet determined, the property, in certain cases, belonging to the Government, while managed by private firms.2. Procedure for the disposal of National factories.The decision of the War Cabinet that the disposal of National Factories should be with--drawn from the purview of the Surplus Government Property Advisory Council, left in suspense the question of the method of disposal of these factories, and the authority that should be responsible for conducting the negotiations on behalf of the Government for the conclusion of a sale or lease. The Committee have pressed repeatedly upon the Minister of Reconstruction the importance of obtaining a decision on these points. Cases have already arisen in which National Factories are either redundant to the needs of the Ministry or are likely to become so in the near future, and it seems desirable that negotiations should be entered into for the eventual disposal of such factories without delay, in order to avoid the loss that might result to the Government if a number of valuable properties were thrown upon the market simul-taneously at the termination of the war. The Committee have also been impressed with the importance of enabling firms to make preparations in advance, in as many National Factories as possible, for the turnover from the manufacture of munitions to peace industries, so that unemployment during the transition period may be reduced to a minimum. To secure this it is clearly necessary to enter into negotiations without delay for the eventual sale or lease of ;some of the National Factories to private firms.The question was raised in a concrete form by a letter dated May 16th from Mr. Hichens Serial Nos. of Messrs. Canimell, Laird &amp; Co., asking for a declaration of the Ministry&apos;s policy with regard 105 and 140. to those of its National Factories which were managed by private firms.   Mr. Hichens put forward the National Ordnance Factory at Nottingham, which is managed by his Company, .as a typical instance.He argued that the most effective method of preparing a National Factory for transitionto peace industry, would be for the managing firm, who were conversant with its capabilities,to work out the details and make preparations for the transfer.   To effect this it was necessarythat the Government should enter into negotiations at the earliest possible moment for theeventual sale of some of the Factories.   Messrs. Cammell, Laird might be prepared to putforward a definite offer with regard to the National Ordnance Factory at Nottingham, butbefore doing so and before working out their plans in detail they wished to know with whomnegotiations should be conducted.    Mr. Hichens also suggested that it was desirable that theofficer responsible for conducting the negotiations should have full powers to conclude a settle-ment.    Sir James Stevenson, since the date of this letter, lias had a personal interview withMr. Hichens, and has received from him a private and confidential letter in which a more orless definite offer is made bv Messrs. Cammell, Laird &amp; Co., for the National Ordnance Factorv v11^.i -vr M&apos;    i - &apos; *  No. 174.:at Nottingham.In order to accelerate a decision on this point, the lack of which was causing continuous and increasing embarrassment to the Ministry of Munitions, a letter was sent on May 2nd to Seriaj the Ministry of Reconstruction, putting forward for Dr. Addison&apos;s consideration the following No. 90. definite suggestion with regard to the procedure to be adopted in the disposal of National Factories:  That the Ministry of Munitions should be responsible for initiating the negotiations for sale or lease, and that in due course the matter should be concluded by them, subject to Treasury sanction and the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction.This Avould be in harmony with the usual procedure for the disposal of Government property, and appeared to be the most effective and direct means of dealing with the matter. Copies of the correspondence with Mr. Hichens with regard to the National Ordnance Factory at Nottingham were also forwarded to Dr. Addison for his information.On August .10th, the Minister of Reconstruction submitted a memorandum on the subject Serial to the War Cabinet, enclosing a copy of the letter of May 2nd from the Ministry of Munitions No. 172. and endorsing the suggestion contained therein that the disposal of such of these national properties as are clearly likely to be redundant to the requirements of the Government after vthe war, should be arranged by the Department responsible for their management, subject to
Treasury sanction and the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction. New questions of principle and difficult cases would ho referred by him to the War Cabinet or to (lie Economic Defence and Development Committee for a decision.Dr. Addisoi)&apos;s memorandum was referred by the War Cabinet to the Economic Defence and Development Committee, who, on September 24th, approved of the proposals contained in it. This decision has yet to be ratified by the War Cabinet.3. Property acquired under the Defence of the Realm Act.An added problem is presented by those factories built on land occupied under the Defence of the Realm Act. Under the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Lands) Act, 1916, the Ministry has power for a period up to three years after the termination of the war, compulsorily to acquire land in its occupation, needed for any of the specific purposes for which lands can be acquired under the Defence Acts or the Military Lands Act. These powers of purchase have not however, in conformity with the views of the Treasury, up to the present been exercised, save in one exceptional case. In January, 1918, the Ministry represented to the Treasury the Serial Nos. advisability of taking steps to purchase before the end of the war, in special cases, property &apos; of which possession had been taken under the Defence of the Realm Act.The point was of importance in that the Ministry had in some cases covenanted with a firm to convey to them at the end of the war land of which the Ministry was in occupation. It was felt that more favourable terms could be secured by immediate action than b*y waiting until the end of the war.    The Treasury agreed to the Ministry&apos;s contention in certain cases : .(a) cases in which the Ministry of Munitions had covenanted with some firm to conveyland of which they were in occupation to the firm after the war;(b) cases in which it is clear that the factory or store erected on the site is permanentlyrequired by the Government for use after the war; (a) cases in which it can be established that purchase of the site is necessary in order to secure for the Government the value of the capital expenditure on the site.The Treasury was prepared to consider on its own merits any case put up by the Ministry, taking into account the cost of acquiring the site, the amount of capital expenditure thereon, the estimated post-war sale of the buildings and plant erected, and the disposal value (after removal) of the property so erected. Schedules are in course of preparation for submission to the Treasury giving detailed information with regard to certain typical cases in which the immediate purchase of property in possession of the Ministry is considered desirable.4. Irish Factories.The Irish Factories and the Royal Ordnance Factories stand rather apart from the main group of national factories and call for individual treatment, the first on political, the second on historical grounds.During 1917 the Prime Minister had been in communication with the All-Ireland Munitions Committee concerning the post-war utilisation of National Factories in Ireland. In the&apos; later months of the year engineers had been appointed by the All-Ireland Committee to visit Dublin, Waterford, Cork and Galway, and to report on the possibility of using the factories after the war for industrial purposes. Early in 19.18 they reported that, as they stood, neither plant nor factories could be used for industrial purposes, but they thought that with regrouping or rearrangement they might be made of use.On the receipt of this report the All-Ireland Committee suggested that they should be authorised to negotiate with manufacturers with a view to the eventual disposal of the Irish factories for industrial purposes.   From the political standpoint it was thought that there Serial was something to be said for a policy of allowing an Irish Committee to frame recommendationsNo. 83. f,g to disposal of Irish factories, and after consultation with Dr. Addison a letter was accordingly sent on April 25th authorising the All-Ireland Committee to enter into negotiations, on the understanding, however, that they had no power to conclude any agreement without reference to the Ministry of Munitions.5. Royal Ordnance Factories.The Royal Ordnance Factories, owing partly to their historic position and partly to the complexity of their associations and functions, have been considered apart.    Owing to lack of unity in headquarters control, Sir Glynn West had in .19.17 suggested the formation of a Board of Control.     This step was however negatived until the whole position had been thoroughly surveyed.     Accordingly, on March 6th, .1918, it was suggested by the Council Committee on the Control of Woolwich Arsenal, appointed to consider Sir Glynn Wesfs proposal, that the Minister should appoint a Committee of Inquiry with terms of reference  &quot; to enquire into and report on the administration, organisation and equipment of, and &quot;nature of work carried on in the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich, and to advise &quot; the Minister of Munitions what, if any, changes are required.   The Committee should &quot; have regard to the importance of efficient and economic production and should give &quot; due wreight to the obligations of the Government as an employer to ensure the best &quot; possible industrial and housing conditions for the employees.&quot; Serial Later in the month the Reconstruction Committee advised that the, terms of reference should beNo. 57. extended to include all the departments within the Arsenal and not the Woolwich Ordnance Factories alone. Accordingly the terms of reference of the Committee when ultimately appointed, were extended 
&quot;to enquire into and report upon the control, administration, organisation, lay out and &quot;equipment of the Royal Ordnance. Factories at Woolwich, and the nature and distri-&quot;bution of the work carried on in them, and at the Arsenal generally, and to advise &quot; the Minister of Munitions what, if any, changes are required.&quot;Mr, McKinnon Wood, M.P., was appointed Chairman and early in August the Committeestarted work.The constitution of the Committee is as follows:  The Rt. Hon. T. McKinnon Wood, M.P. (Chairman). Mr. W. Adamson, M.P. Vice-Admiral Sir R. H. S. Bacon. Sir A. DuCros, M.P. Mr. G. W. Currie, M.P. Major General Sir W. Furse. . Mr.&apos; .T. M. Henderson, M.P.

Murray   JPART IV.-SUMMARY.CHAPTER XII.Summary of Progress and Future Problems.Of necessity much of the work of the Committee surveyed in this Report has been in the nature of clearing the ground. Before decisions can be made information must be collected, on strength of which general principles can be laid down. The Committee has dealt with the principles which should determine the demobilisation both of the Ministry of Munitions itself, and of the labour employed through the country on munitions work. It has elicited from the Departments concerned their opinion as to the immediate handling of trade after the war, as regards relaxation of control of material and prices, and has endeavoured to find out from the trades concerned the probable post-war demand for materials.It has given much thought to the question of priority during the transition period in order to establish general principles facilitating the smooth passage of industry from war to peace footing. It has, in addition, considered the steps necessary for disposal of Goverment&apos; property, whether factories, machinery, or surplus stores, and has dealt with the instructions to be issued for cessation of production of war material on the advent of peace. In many of these cases principles have been decided, and in several others decisions are awaited from outside bodies whose advice the Ministry has sought.It now remains to apply these principles to the particular problems of demobilisation. Steps must be taken to prepare definite plans for the individual national factories, and to determine the orders to be given to each class of industry at present engaged on the manufacture of muni-tions when this form of production is no longer required.The ground has been explored with some thoroughness, but the Committee cannot proceed much further with the preparation of concrete plans for dealing with many of the most important problems that will present themselves for solution at the hands of the Ministry of Munitions on the cessation of hostilities until some definite declaration of policy has been made by the proper authorities on the following points :  (.1) Tlie post-war use of national factories, in particular whether arrangements are to he made during the war period for the disposal of some of them for post-war use to private firms, and if so, who is to be responsible for conducting the negotiations.Some progress has recently been made towards obtaining a decision, on this point, as stated on pages 27 and 28 of this Report. On September 24th, the Economic Defence and Development Committee decided to recommend to the War Cabinet that the Minister of Munitions, subject to the concurrence of the Minister of Reconstruction and the sanction of the Treasury, should be responsible for conducting negotiations with private firms for the eventual disposal of some of the national factories that will clearly be redundant to the requirements of the Government after the war. As soon as this recommendation has been accepted by the War Cabinet the Ministry of Munitions will be in a position to consider proposals from private firms for the post-war use of some of the national factories.But a declaration of policy is still required from the War Cabinet on a wider aspect of the question.   If the fullest benefit is to be obtaned from these great national properties after the
war, it is essential that the Government should decide at an early date what industrial products (apart from munitions) the State should manufacture for its own use, or for the use of Dominion Governments or local authorities. When a decision is obtained on this point, it will be a com-para lively simple matter for the Ministry of Munitions to indicate those national factories which are most suitable for the purposes desired and in due course make preparations for their transfer to industrial production.(2) The output of&quot;munitions of various kinds required by the War Office after the cessation of hostilities, and the stocks of munitions to be maintained.On this point it has not, up to the present, been possible to obtain a statement of policy from the War Office.(3) The relative priority that is to be assigned to the equipment and development of various forms of industry after the war.The progress which has so far been made towards obtaining a decision ou this point is shown in Chapter VII of this Report. It is hoped that the Minister of Reconstruction will very soon be in a position to make a further public announcement with regard to the Cabinet Committee and the Standing Advisory Council for post-war priority, which he is in the process of forming. When this machinery has been set up it will be possible to consider applications from firms for facilities for post-war developments and to grant them such assistance as the over-riding claims of urgent war orders will permit.(4) Whether provision is to be made, by the creation of a Ministry of Supply, for con-tinning many of the functions at present exercised, by the Ministrypf Munitions.This is another question of general policy which has been the subject of much discussion but on which no decision has yet been given. Failing a ruling on the main issue, provisional plans will need to be prepared for securing continuity in the work of those branches of the Ministry of which the permanent retention in some form appears to be necessary.The four considerations mentioned above cover nearly the whole field of demobilisation and reconstruction so far as the Ministry of Munitions is concerned. As the Government&apos;s policy with regard to them becomes more clearly defined the Committee will be able to give more definite shape to the plans which it has at present under consideration. In the meantime the continued investigation of some of the more immediate practical problems which confront the Committee cannot.be delayed.   Among these may be mentioned:-(a) the working out in detail of plans for the demobilisation of the Ministry itself; (6) the setting up of machinery for the disposal of surplus stores and industrial equipment in possession of the Ministry;(c) the investigation of the possibilities for post-war use of individual national factories;(d) the negotiation for sale or lease to private firms of factories which will clearly beredundant at the end of the war;(e) the preparation of instructions for the termination of contracts for the various classesof munitions;(/) the actual modifications of current munition output required under various conditionsof armistice or partial suspension of hostilities. (g) the consideration of the best means of affording facilities to private firms to turn overto peace work;(//) the use that should be made during and after demobilisation of the central and local labour organisations of the Ministry.Considerable progress has already been made in the investigation of these questions.   It remains for the Committee to work out the details, so far as they are able to do so, and mean-. while to press for a decision by the Government on the fundamental questions of policy alluded to above.
