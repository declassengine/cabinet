I desire to support on the broad principles outlined in Dr.Addison&apos;s proposal G,Tc5837, the establishment by lav; of holidays for male and female wage earners.At the same time, there are some points of importance in regard to his detailed proposals which would appear to require further consideration.    In particular -(a) The question of 14 consecutive days,(To) System of assessing pay during holiday period.In the large industries of engineering and ship-building, as well as probably others of which I am ignorant, definite holidays, although not prescribed by law, are actually given by custom,     I believe they approximate to an allowance of 6 to 8 days at Christmas or the New Year, and 7 to 10 days in summer.      This system of 2 breaks in the year provides suitable opportunities for plant repairs, and also gives a six-monthly break from the monotony of service, which would be too great if arranged at yearly stages.With regard to pay.     I regard an isolated proposal of this character as a somewhat dangerous entrenchment on the delicate question of remuneration and they appear to me fraught with great dangers of dispute.    For example, the safeguard against unjustifiable dismissal will be most difficult to interpret in actual practice. Troubles will arise in connection with known bad timekeepers, whilst strikes occurring close to the holiday period, might produce difficulties and anomalies.    Further, the six-monthly conditions of service before payment appears to me to operate unfairly.Accordingly, taking Dr. Addison&apos;s 3 proposals, I desire to suggest as regards -(1) lily full agreement.(2) Two holiday periods to be established by law, the winter period to be as short as practicable in view of the necessity for repairs; while the summer period should be not less than 10 days.To overcome the difficulties with regard to remuneration which I have referred to above, the following arrangement is suggested.    The worker is to be credited by the employer each week with a sum representing 4$ of his actual earnings, the sum thus accumulated to be paid over to the worker on the occasion of his annual holidays, or in the event of his changing his^employment,(3) The dates and periods of the holidays to be determined by responsible organisations of employers and workers, proper attention being given to the views of the civic and local authorities, also the railway companies.The percentages stated above are based on an average of 4$ additional on earnings as representing 2 weeks in 50 weeks.A scheme on the above general lines secures, I think,, a genuinely ffeir system, under which the holiday pay is definitely related to service and causes of disputes are removed.15,10.18.
