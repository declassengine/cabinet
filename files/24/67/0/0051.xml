November 1918.SECRET. 10G.T.6051. . ,war cabinet.CONTINUANCE OF-EMERGENCY LEGISLATION.Note ry the Minister op Reconstruction.I SUBMIT for the consideration of my colleagues the annexed memorandum on the continuance of emergency legislation after the termination of the war.The guidance of the War Cabinet is asked by the Departments upon which the burden will mainly fall of performing the special duties arising out of the very exceptional circumstances of demobilisation and reconstruction.The Departments will submit to the Select Committee on Emergency Legislation the particulars of their requirements and will ask the Committee to recommend to Parliament the continuance of the necessary enactments and regulations. But they will be greatly assisted in doing so if the War Cabinet will give their sanction and approval to the general principles which, in the opinion of the Departments, ought to govern the temporary continuance tor the above-mentioned purposes of powers which were primarily conferred upon them for the purposes of the war.They have, therefore, by agreement, and in order to enable the War Cabinet to form an opinion, set out in the memorandum attached, under the three heads of 1. Espionage and Aliens,2. Maintenance of Public Order and Discipline, and 3. Control of Materials, Means of Transport, and Food,the main grounds upon which, from the point of view of the Departments in each case concerned, they ask for the continuance of such of the Defence of the Realm Regulations as in their opinion fairly illustrate the policy which ought to be adopted especially with regard to matters of a controversial nature. The Departments ask for the approval of the War Cabinet of the general lines they have followed.C. ADDISON.Ministry of Reconstruction,October 19, 1918.MINISTRY OF RECONSTRUCTION.Memorandum on the Continuance of Emergency Legislation. (Confidential.)1. The appointment of a Select Committee to take into consideration the report of Mr. Justice Atkin&apos;s Committee, and matters connected therewith, and to report what provision should be made by Parliament for defining the meaning of the phrase &quot; end of the war &quot; and other similar phrases occurring in the War Emergency Statutes, and for extending in whole or in part or shortening the period of operation of the several emergency statutes and the several Regulations made thereunder, renders it necessary tor the Departments concerned to seek the directions of the War Cabinet on certain questions of policy.2. The Select Committee will no doubt desire to be informed of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the continuance of certain important powers conferred in the main by the Defence of the Realm Acts and the Regulations and Orders made under these Acts[925]&apos; B
3. Individual Departments have no authority to represent the views of the Government on these important and controversial topics, and the following statement (which is restricted in scope to matters of high policy) has been prepared as the outcome of conferences held between representatives of the Departments concerned, in order that the Departments may receive the instructions of the Government as to the course which should be pursued in tendering evidence on these topics to the Select Committee.4. The powers in question will in general, in the absence of provision for their continuance, lapse on the termination of the war. For the purposes of this memorandum the interpretation of this phrase suggested by Mr. Justice Atkins Committee has been adopted, viz., that the date of the termination of the war is the date of the exchange or deposit of ratifications of the Treaty of Peace.5. The Defence of the Realm Regulations which have been considered by the conference referred to above relate to matters falling under the following heads : (A.) Espionage and Aliens.(B.) Maintenance of Public Order and Discipline.(C.) Control of Materials, Means of Transport, and Food.6. The recommendations of the conference, which are approved by the Ministers concerned, are set out in the following paragraphs.(A..)-Espionage and Aliens. ,7. As regards espionage the War Office have prepared a Bill to amend the Official Secrets Act, which is being considered by other Departments. If this Bill, the title of which is &quot; The National Security Bill,&quot; is passed before the termination of the war, it will make it possible to allow Regulation 18, which lays a prohibition on obtaining and communicating naval and military information, and a number of other Regulations of similar purport, to lapse at that date.But should the Government not approve the Bill or be unable to secure its passage before that date, it will be necessary to keep the relevant Regulations in force at least during the period of demobilisation.8. As regards aliens the Home Office have a general measure in preparation which will, it is hoped, be passed before the termination of the war.Pending the passing of this Bill it is suggested that such Regulations as are necessary for the adequate supervision of aliens and undesirable persons should be kept in force.The Bill, however, will not provide for the continuance of the powers conferred by Regulations 14 (Power to remove suspects from specified areas) and 14 b (Restrictions on or internment of persons of hostile origin or associations).9. The Admiralty and War Office suggest that the powers under Rrgulation 14 should be retained for a period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the termination of the war.10. The Admiralty and the War Office suggest that the powers under Regula-tion 14 B need only be retained so as to enable the Secretary of State to keep in internment persons already interned under the Regulation for a period not exceeding twelve months from the date of the termination of the war. The Home Office agrees, but thinks the period should be six months. The retention of the powers is necessary both because most of the persons affected are actively hostile to the national interests, and would, if released immediately upon the termination of the war, be likely to do their best to embarrass the Government in the critical early stages of demobilisation ; and because there is a risk of civil commotion if these persons are set at liberty during a time of acute public excitement.(B.) Maintenance of Public Order and Discipline.11. As regards Liquor Control there, is general agreement among the Departments concerned that Regulations 10, 10 a, 10 c, and 40 a, and the Regulations made in pursuance of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1915, should continue and be enforceable during the period of demobilisation. This will enable control to be exercised by naval and military authorities over licensed premises, intoxicants, and places of public entertainment, and ensure the effective continuance of the powers of the Central Control Board.12. In the opinion of the Home Office Regulation 10 B, which enables the Secretary of State to restrict, either generally or in particular areas, the hours&apos;in the. evening
during which any class of business may be carried on, should be continued until there is time to consider permanent legislation which is sure to be strongly demanded.13. As regards Control of Traffic in Arms it is suggested that the powers contained in Regulation 30 should be continued until legislation can be obtained on the lines recommended by a Committee on this subject which is now sitting.(C.) Control of Materials, Means of Transport, and Food14. The Departments mainly concerned with the regulations imposing these forms of control aro the Board of Trade, Ministry of Munitions, War Office, Ministry of Shipping, and Ministry of Food. The views of these Departments as to the extent and duration of the continued control which they desire to be secured are set out in the following paragraphs: Board of Trade.Powers which it is necessary to continue temporarily.15. Regulations 2 b, 2 f-2 jj, and 7. Under these regulations the Board of Trade has powers, with respect.to articles of commerce not being articles of food, similar to those enjoyed by the Food Controller. These include power to take possession of goods, to fix maximum and minimum prices, to require persons to dispose of stocks and to make returns, to take possession of factories, workshops, &amp;c, give directions as to work to he carried on, take evidence on oath at enquiries preliminary to exercising powers under the regulations, and requisition, in whole or in part, the output of factories in which &apos; articles of commerce are being produced, at prices to be fixed by arrangement or by arbitration. These regulations contain the basis of the control exercised over petrol, coal, gas, and electricity consumption, cotton, timber, paper, and tobacco and matches. It is clear that there must be power to continue these controls temporarily after the war; and the regulations, therefore, should be continued so far as they give powers neces3ary for this purpose. Probably the period of extension should be twelve months after the end of the war, though possibly some of the provisions might be dispensed with or modified.Regulation, 2 c. The Army Council or Board of Trade may enter on any land,for the purpose of inspecting and marking trees and take possession of such trees. They may also take possession of land, buildings, plant, &amp;c, required in connection with the cutting or storage of trees. It appears necessary to continue these powers temporarily in view of the probable continuance of the timber shortage.Regulation 2 g. Enables the Board of Trade to require returns giving particulars as to their businesses from persons engaged in the production, manufacture, purchase, sale, distribution, transport, storage, or shipment of goods. It is essential that such powers to call for returns should exist during the period of reconstruction.   .Regulation 2 jjj. Enables the Board of Trade to ensure the provision and main-tenance of an efficient system of road transport by regulating the use of road transport, taking possession of horses and vehicles, regulating the priority in which goods are to be carried, &amp;c. The continuance of this power during the period of demobilisation seems necessary, in view of the pressure which is likely to be exerted upon transport facilities generally.Regulation 7 b. Enables the Board of Trade to take possession of private owners&apos; wagons on the railways, to enforce prompt loading and unloading, curtail statutory requirements as to running of trains and fares, and prescribe conditions under which tickets are to be issued. It appear to be necessary to extend this Regulation for some time after the war, since during demobilisation there is bound to be great pressure upon transport facilities. The Railway Department think that powers as regards-railways and canals given by Defence of the Realm Regulations should be continued for two 3ears after the war. Also that powers under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871, should be continued for two years. Control over the railways under this Act and under the Order in Council of the 4th August, 1914, is continued by warrant from week to week so long as the Secretary of State, in his absolute discretion, certifies that an emergency exists. It is understood that he would be prepared so to certify throughout the period of demobilisation, but should the Select Committee entertain any doubt as to this course being within the spirit as well as the letter of the statute, it is suggested that they -should be asked to recommend that further legislation be introduced to remove the doubt.
Regulation 7 bb. Enables the Board of Trade to permit an increase of statutory charges of carriers between Great Britain and Ireland. A similar Regulation is 39 bb, referred to below, which relates to docks and harbours. It would probably be wise to continue these Regulations in force as emergency measures for three or four years after the war, until some idea is obtained as to what the new normal level of prices will be. Measures af a permanent character can then be taken if necessary.Regulation 9 g. This enables the Board of Trade to take possession of coal mines and give directions as to their management and user. Power of control must be continued during the coal shortage after the war m order that distribution may be efficiently regulated. The period suggested by the Coal Controller is six months after the end of the war or until the end of the winter following the conclusion of peace, whichever is the later date. It may, of course, be decided to continue the control of coal mines upon general considerations of public policy, but this is a question which it is not proposed to discuss in this memorandum. Apart from such a decision, a further extension of control might be necessary in the event of nationalisation being strongly supported by the miners with a threat to strike, which the country could not stand during the period of reconstruction.Begulation 9h. Enables the Board of Trade to take possession of any canal and give directions as to management and user. Carriers may be prohibited from disposing of barges, plant, &amp;c. Canal carriers maybe controlled similarly to canals. It seems highly desirable that power of control should be continued for a time after the war. There is likely to be pressure upon transport facilities generally. Moreover, a trans-portation system works as a whole, and there should be power to control canals under the Regulation as long as railway-owned canals can be controlled under the Regulation of the Forces Act, 1871. As suggested above, this period would be for two years after the end of the war. It is possible that this might not be sufficient to enable the canak to get into regular working, but no doubt control could be further extended at the end of the two years if found desirable.Regulation 39 bb. Gives the Board of Trade power to permit dock and harbour undertakings to make charges in excess of the statutory maxima where such under-takings cannot be efficiently carried on otherwise. It would probably be wise to continue this Regulation in force as an emergency measure for three or four years until some idea is obtained as to what the new normal level of prices will be. Measures of a permanent character can then be taken&apos;if necessary.Regulation 39 g. Provides that an application for the transfer of the registry of a British ship from a port of registry in the United Kingdom to a port of registry outside the United Kingdom shall not be made without the consent of the Board of Trade. The continuance of this power as a temporary measure is very important.There are two Regulations as to the continuance of which the Board of Trade and the Admiralty do not agree.2 d enables directions to be given as to the priority in the supply of coal and coke. The Board of Trade say that, although distribution of coal will probably have to remain under control temporarily, they consider this Regulation as unnecessary. The-Admiralty, however, regard its continuance during demobilisation as essential.30 bb prohibits the transfer to aliens or foreign, controlled companies, without the consent of the Board of Trade, of an interest in mines of certain ores, oil-fields, and businesses connected with contraband in certain foreign countries. The Board of Trade take the view that the refusal to allow properties to pass under neutral control in peace time could only be justified as a result of the considered opinion of Parliament expressed in legislation. There is nothing they say, in special reconstruction conditions to justify its retention. The Admiralty, on the other hand, are strongly of opinion that this Regulation ought not to be allowed to lapse until Parliament has had an opportunity of considering proposals for permanent legislation on the subject.Ministry of Munitions.16. Regulations 2 b, 2bb, 2 b, 7, 15 c, and 30 a. A very large number of Orders liave been made by the Minister of Munitions under one or other of these Regulations, by which the stocks in hand, and the supplies, of most of the raw materials of industry are controlled, and dealings in these materials are regulated.Under certain of these Orders, in particular those relating to lead, copper, flax, and tar oils, the State has practically become the owner for the time being of all stocks of these materials in the country, and under others of these Orders it is necessary for any person selling or dealing in material of the classes controlled to procure a licence from
-the Department concerned. The stocks in hand at the cessation of hostilities may be very considerable. The main objects aimed at in the framing of these Orders have been the diversion of the manufacture and&apos;supply of the materials in question into the most useful channels; the avoidance, so l&apos;ar; as1 possible, of waste, and the prevention of speculative dealings by the regulation of prices. It is under certain of these Orders (and the cases of iron, coke, and steel may in particular be referred to), that the prices of the commodities in question have been fixed in the&apos;interests of the whole community;It is almost inevitable that such control, though perhaps in a modified form, will require to be continued during the period immediately following the cessation of hostilities, and most of the arguments adduced by the War Office (see paragraph 17 below) in favour of the retention, for a limited period, of these Regulations, are also applicable to the case of the Ministry of Munitions, It lias been found that manufac-turers have adapted themselves to a certain amount of control, and the relaxation of that control cannot be accomplished hurriedly or abruptly without creating great confusion.&apos; Further, for the purposes of Reconstruction, it may still be necessary to retain the power of controlling the supply of materials, with a view to their diversion into the most useful channels, in order to meet the most urgent post-war needs of the community.- Even after the operation of the Regulations has been relaxed, it will be necessary to retain the power to carry out that which has already been ordered, but which may not have been fully performed for instance, numerous Orders have been made under Regulations 2 b, 2 bb, 2 e, and 7, for the proper execution of which it is necessary to investigate costs of manufacture. Such investigations are at present proceeding under powers conferred by Regulation 15 c, but hp numerous cases cannot be terminated for long periods, which may possibly run into years. It is obvious that in such cases it would be impossible to allow the powers under Which these costing operations are being conducted to come to an end until their entire object has been accomplished.    ;    ;Regulations 8 (Power to take Possession of any Factory or Plant) and 8 a (Power to Direct or Restrict Work in any Factory and to Remove Plant). These Regulations have been used by the Ministry of Munitions in a good many instances, and the Ministry is at present in possession of certain factories and workshops under Regulation 8,&apos;and is alsd actively controlling the manufactures conducted at other&apos; factories and workshops under Regulation 8 a. In so far as Concerns the actual possession of the factories or workshops, the continuance of such possession is already provided for by tlie Defence of the iRealni (Acquisition of Land) Act, and this Act would&quot; probably also apply to the plant1 referred to in Regulation 8, if fixed, though there might be some doubt as to loose plant. As regards Regulation 8 a, however (apart from the important question of&apos; priority, which is further referred to below) it would be; most inexpedient, and indeed disastrous, that the control which is being exercised by the Ministry of Munitions over&apos; many important industries through this Regulation should be precipi-tately relaxed, and it is suggested that the continuation of this Regulation for a considerable period&apos;after the cessation of hostilities is essential.Regulation 8 a. The maintenance of this Regulation is also considered important from another point of view, by reason of the fact that it is by means of this Regulation that the entire system of priority in manufacture which, since the beginning of 1916, has pervaded every industry1 of importance in the country, has been organised and made effective. Under this Regulation the Minister issued the Priority of Work Order of the 8th March, 1917, whereby he directed&apos;that all persons engaged in any of the&apos;trades or industries therein referred to should &apos;* comply with the directions and regulations as to the priority to be given to work carried Out in their factories and workshops&apos;and elsewhere in or in connection with such trades or industries.&quot; Although in some cases the&apos;Controller of1 Priority co-operates with other Departments in1 the administration 6f Orders as to manufacture issued under other Regulations, it is Regulation 8&apos;a!which forms the main foundation of priority control.&apos;    ;It is inconceivable that this&apos; system of priority in manufacture can be altogether abandoned during the considerable period&quot; of reconstruction which must&apos;follow the cessation of hostilities/for there will ofnecessity&apos; continue to be a shortage of essential materials of many descriptions, and the Government will probably desire&apos; to retain the power to direct the manufacturing capacity of the country into the most useful channels. This&apos;Regulation needs to be considered in connection with the group of Regulations relating&apos;to the&apos;Control of Materials already referred to. &apos; If these Regulations-are&apos; not continued in their present or1 in a &apos;slightly&quot; modified&apos; form it will be necessary for similar powers to be: obtained;l by fresh&apos; legislation !l! J^:&apos;   &apos;)w 1 &apos;l&apos;m ir,i (,(! ;(iV&apos;     *
Regulation 9 gg. Under this Regulation the Ministry of Munitions is in possession of all the iron ore mines in Cumberland and Lancaster, and these mines are being worked under the management of the owners in accordance with an agreement entered into with them. The Regulation has also been applied to certain wolfram and other metalliferous mines. The uncertainty as to the conditions which are likely to prevail after the war in the iron and steel industry make it undesirable that the powers conferred by this Regulation should be abruptly terminated. It is therefore considered desirable that the Regulation should be continued for some period after the termination of the war, if for no other reason in order to assist the Government in allocating available supplies, maintaining production, regulating prices, and, so far as possible, obviating the possibility of labour troubles in connection with the output of Ihese mines.Regulations 42 d and 45 (h). Prior to the introduction of these Regulations it was practically impossible to inflict a penalty upon a person, whether a contractor or workman, who, either wilfully or by gross negligence, manufactured or assisted in manufacturing fraudulent or defective stores which might endanger the lives of those using them. Action against the contractor in a civil Court for breach of contract was no doubt possible, but it was not possible to proceed against the workmen unless a special case of conspiracy amongst more than one person could be discovered. This made prosecution practically impossible. The introduction of Regulation 42 d was primarily aimed at cases of suspected sabotage, but it has been found useful in a number of less serious cases; and Regulation 45 (h) was inserted to meet certain serious instances of defrauding the Inspection Department by tampering with test pieces. The permanent retention of these Regulations, or the introduction of an amended Public Stores Act containing provisions akin thereto, for the purpose of giving the Government a full measure of control over persons engaged in the manufacture of war material is considered highly desirable if not essential.War Office.17. Regulation 2 b. The power of taking possession of war materials, food, forage, and other stores, and the machinery for determining the price to be paid for them, are of very great importance. During a considerable, part of the demobilisation period the strength of the&apos; Army will remain at a high figure, and as it is the policy of the War Office to avoid the maintenance of excessive reserves, it cannot safely be assumed that the stocks in existence on demobilisation will in all cases suffice to meet its requirements, which as regards supplies and stores other than those used solely in the fighting line must still, in spite of the reduced rate of consumption, be very heavy in the aggregate. Further, large bodies of troops must continue for several months to be located in various countries overseas, and this may at any time give rise to emergent demands of a nature which cannot be foreseen. On the other hand, importation of supplies from abroad will be restricted owing to the scarcity of tonnage and the heavy demands for transport for the troops.The retention of this Regulation is, therefore, essential in order to ensure the provision of the requirements of the Army. It is also indispensable in connection with the control exercised by the Department over certain industries, which it will be impossible to bring to an end immediately on the cessation of hostilities.Regulation 2 b. This Regulation, together with Regulations 2 b, 7, 8 a, and 15 c, and the power of restricting importation and exportation which has been exercised through the Board of Trade, constitute in effect the machinery for the regulation and control of certain branches of industry in order to secure essential supplies for the Army as well as to safeguard civilian requirements, and the exercise of these powers has been found by practical experience to be indispensable for this purpose. It is pointed out that where an extensive svstem of control has been put into operation with regard to -an industry of wide-reaching ramifications, such control cannot be suddenly brought to an end; and as regards the more important war materials, many of the circumstances that have rendered control imperative will continue to exist. The shortage in tonnage and the employment of existing shipping to a preponderating extent on Government service will reproduce during the demobilisation period the present conditions of restricted imports, keen competition, and artificial prices. It has also become necessary in certain industries for the Department to take control of supplies for civilian purposes, especially in the cases of leather and wool, and to some extent boots and cloth.Where war conditions have created acute shortage in industries controlled by the Department it has been necessary for the protection of the public to fix the price of -civilian supplies, and a sudden withdrawal of such control might open the way to
profiteering. As, moreover, the price at which the Department has in some cases been able to supply the trade with materials is considerably below their world value, it would probably, even from the trader&apos;s point of view, create a serious dislocation of the entire industry if the Department were suddenly to abdicate its general control.Moreover, as regards certain materials the Department has developed new sources of supply, some of which were in German hands before the war (e.g., the trade in East Indian kips), and it is desirable that the newly-established trade should be tided over the difficult period following the cessation of hostilities.Furthermore, there is the important question of the heavy stocks and commitments in raw materials which the Department will have on hand at the close of the war. The holdings in wool amount in value to 58,000,0001, whilst those of hides, leather, &amp;c, amount to 10,000,000L, and the liquidation of these stocks to the best advantage, both of the State and of the trades concerned, will m itself necessitate the continuance of the general control of the industry.Regulation 7. The powers given by this Regulation are analogous to those contained in No. 2 b, which deals with the requisition of, and assessment of prices for, goods already in existence, whilst No. 7 contains corresponding provisions as regards articles to be manufactured. The reasons advanced to justify the continuance of No. 2 b apply equally in the present case ; and there is this further consideration which applies specially to supplies for which the Army depends on the manufacturing resources of the country, viz., that the desire not to be left behind in the struggle to recapture private, home, and export trade, is likely in some cases to make firms indisposed to undertake Government work, particularly as their productive capacity may be temporarily impaired by the withdrawal on an extensive scale of female labour and dilutees before the return of demobilised soldiers. It would, therefore, be unsafe to rely on purely voluntary bargaining to secure on reasonable terms during this difficult period the share of the manufacturing capacity of the country necessary to provide for army requirements. Moreover, on the powers conferred by Regulation 7 depends the whole system of costings&apos; investigation, through which immense economies have been effected during the war, and as regards these powers the Public Accounts5 Committee,, in their report of the 31st July, 1917, have expressed the hope that they will be retained on a return to normal conditions., On these grounds the retention of this Regulation is essential.It must be borne in mind that some of the Regulations, the continuance of which is required by the War Office, are considered to be essential for the purpose of carrying out the scheme of demobilisation, and also for providing for the re-formation of the post helium army.If the Regulations themselves are not continued, it will doubtless be necessary to initiate legislation conferring on the War Department similar powers to those contained in the Regulations. It will be observed that the War Office have limited their request for the continuance of these Regulations to the period of demobilisation.Ministry of Shipping.18. The Minister of Shipping, under the title of Shipping Controller, was appointed under the New Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1916, for the purpose:of organising and maintaining the supply of shipping in the national interests in connection with the present war.The problem of the control of shipbuilding is essentially one for the immediate post- -war period, and during that period (i.e.t for a year after the termination of the war), the Ministry of Shipping will continue in existence. As the Act is drafted, however, the Ministry&apos;s powers, being largely derived from regulations under the Defence of the Realm Act, will, for the most part, lapse automatically on the termination of the war. It clearly cannot have been intended to prolong the existence of the Ministry without powers, and the absence of the necessary provision in the New Ministries and Secretaries Act may no doubt be attributed to a drafting omission. Steps must, in any event, be taken before the end of the war to remedy the omission, and when this has been done the Ministry will be ^armed with all necessary powers to enable it to deal effectively with the shipping and shipbuilding problem during the period immediately following the termination of hostilities.It is accordingly suggested that provision should be made for preserving to the-Ministry for one year after the date of the termination of the war such powers as may actually be vested in the Ministry at that date.[925] * D
Regulations required for the Control of Shipping Traffic in the Interests of Safety.It will be impracticable owing to the presence of mines to allow unrestricted movement of shipping in the home waters for many months after the end of the war, and for this reason the general powers of direction and control conferred on the Admiralty will have to be retained.It follows that Regulation 36 (Navigation in Harbour), 36 a (Control of Boats), 37 (Navigation), 37 c (Apparatus for British Ships), 38 (Prohibition of Vessels in Dangerous Areas), 39 (Pilotage), 39 a (Control of Crew in Requisitioned Ships) must be continued.Regulation 37 a (Signalling Apparatus on British Ships), 37 b (&quot;Wireless Telegraphy on British Ships), 38 b (Entrance of Defensively-Armed Merchant Ships to Docks and Ports), 39 f (Prohibiting the Employment as Agent for a British Ship of a Person of Enemy Nationality), should also be continued temporarily.Ministry of Food.19. The Office of the Food Controller was constituted under the New Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1916, and by Section 13 of that Act the Office and the Ministry of Food will cease to exist twelve months after the conclusion of the present war or at such earlier date as may be fixed by His Majesty in Council.The powers of the Food Controller are ultimately derived from Section 4 of the Act, which provides that he shall have such powers as may be transferred to him from any Government. Department by Order in Council, and also such further powers as may be conferred on him by Regulations under the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914.The main body of the Food Controllers power arises from the Defence of the Reaini Regulations, and will be found contained in Regulations 2 b, 2 e, 2 f, 2 g, 2 gg, 2 h, 2 j, and 7 and 8 c. Mr. Justice Atkins Committee have advised that the powers under the befence of trie Realm Regulations will cease on the termination of the war, and that, therefore, the Food Controllers orders cannot be operative after that date.In the view of the Food Controller it is clear that some measure of control Over foodstuffs will require to be exercised for a considerable period after the war, and also that the most convenient way of exercising control is that he should be empowered to issue special Orders in the same manner as is authorised by the Defence of trie Realm Regulations. vIt is a matter to be considered whether it would not be convenient to deal with the whole position, of Food Control by a special Act of Parliament, but upon the assumption&apos; that the powers of the Food Controller are to be continued under existing legislation, it is suggested that the following legislation shall be prolonged : :(a.) The powers vested in the Food Controller under the Defence of the Realm Regulations should be continued for a period co-terminous with the con-. tinuance of his office.(b.) The provisions of sub-section 2 of section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1915, as applied by the Food Controllers (Con-current Powers) Order, 1917 (being an Order in Council of the 6th Februarjr, 1917), which relate to relief from liability for non-fulfilment of contracts occasioned by the Food Controllers action under Defence of the Realm Regulations, should be continued in force.(c.) The provision contained in section 3 of the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act, 1917, which is of the same character as the provisions referred to under (o), applies only to matters connected with the present war. In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the provisions referred to in (6j above, it would be desirable to have a statutory provision on the lines of that contained in section 3 applicable so long as the Food Controller^ Orders remain in force.20. The foregoing paragraphs do not purport to contain an exhaustive statement of the Defence of the Realm Regulations which it may be necessary to retain in operation after the end of the war j nor do they cover the emergency legislation other than the Defence of the Rralm Acts whicn /confers powers tnat il may be desired to continue after that date.
The War Office have submitted to us certain recommendations dealing with (a.) The powers necessary to retain with the Colours men required for thepersonnel of cadres, and for safeguarding equipment, animals, and stores. (b.) The power to recall to the Colours men whose services will be required in theevent of remobilisation becoming necessary during demobilisation, (c.) Measures extending the operation of the Official Secrets Act, 1911, to coveroffences which experience gained during the war proves are not within theAct.The requirements of the War Office with regard to these matters are approved, but as they concern the War Department almost exclusively it has been arranged that they should be dealt with separately by them.21. It may subsequently be necessary to submit further questions in regard to emergency legislation to the War Cabinet. Certain Regulations should be continued in force until Parliament has had an opportunity of considering proposals for permanent legislation. But in the meantime the War Cabinet are asked to authorise the repre-sentatives of the several Departments concerned to state to the Select Committee that His Majesty&apos;s Government approve the principles suggested in this memorandum.
