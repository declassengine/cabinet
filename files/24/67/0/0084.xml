Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.Demobilization in Munition Industries.I trust that the Cabinet will answer the Minister of Munitions by assenting to his alternative question (b) in tho Paper which he writes on the 18th OctoberMy experience as Minister of Munitions and as Secretary to the Treasury when the Ministry of Munitions was founded, and the work which I did on the Reconstruction Committee make me emphatic in the opinion that great expenditure, great delay, great extravagance of effort, great confusion, overlapping and anomaly have been caused during the war by the imperfect and incomplete allocation of functions between the War Office, the Admiralty, the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Labour. The fact that two or more Departments have been placing contracts for similar articles requiring the same raw materials and making demands on the same supply of labour has been, I think, one of the prime difficulties with which the supply of our lighting forces has had to contend. Nobody in the Ministry of Munitions will, I venture to think, be found to deny this, and I have stated it more than once in the Bouse of Commons with, I believe, general assent.It is unthinkable that after the elaborate organisation called the Ministry of Munitions has been so successfully built up, it should disappear, leaving the future supply of all the Services to be distributed among the older Departments. I would remind the Cabinet that we were in great danger at one time of setting up a separate Supply Department for the Air Ministry. It was only after protracted debate that this grave mistake was obviated, and the history of Supply for the Air Ministry would, I think, justify the policy of concentration into one Department and show that the difficulties can be overcome.The main difficulties, I think, are (1) The manning of such a Supply Department. It seems to me essential that steps should be taken to secure the services of those who would be wanted for the State when war has ceased, and that the objections to paying-adequate salaries to technical and export State servants, and even to Civil Servants, should be faced and overcome.(2) The difficulty of ensuring expert and practical assistance in design and research without divorcing design from supply. This is a difficulty which the War Office and the Air Ministry in its earlier days both regarded as insuperable. It was overcome department by department in regard to the munition supply of the War Office. It has, I believe, been successfully overcome in air matters, and there is no reason now to suppose that these difficulties are insuperable or that they cannot be overcome by organisation.I agree most cordially with the Minister of Munitions about the necessity of collecting under one Ministry and under the same Parliamentary responsibility the Governments dealings with the labour which it employs.I think that the Cabinet should also remember that these questions are under the consideration of Lord HaIdano&apos;s Committee on the Machinery of Government and that they are almost certainly about to recommend the creation of such a Ministry of National Supply.(G.T. 6041).E. S. M.21st October 1918.SS 8     In   10/18
