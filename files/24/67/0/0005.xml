loo?     ALLIED MARITIME TRANSPORT COUNCIL.ALL 55Full Association of the United States Government.The Council at their recent Session (September 30th, October 1st and 2nd, 1918) considered the tonnage position in relation to the four main requirements of food, munitions, raw materials and the supply of the American Army during the cereal year 1918/19.The Hon. Newton D. Baker, United States Secretary of War, was present.So far as the European Allies are concerned, the general position was that on a balance of the tonnage under the control of the European Allies and the needs of those Allies for food, munitions and raw material during the cereal year 1918/19, there was a serious deficit of carrying power as set against the programmes of requirements.So far as the United States was concerned, the general position was that American tonnage, while increasing, was at present insufficient and would continue for some months to be insufficient to meet the immediate needs of the Supply Programme for the American Army.The Council, therefore, were confronted (1) by ah immediate American deficit, and (2) by an Allied deficit for the whole cereal year 1918/19 developing to its worst in the later months of the cereal year.The solution of the difficulty was, the Council considered, to be found in the fact that, according to estimates of American shipbuilding produced by Mr. Baker, American tonnage will be more than sufficient by next Spring to meet the minimum needs of the Supply Programme of the American Army. This rendered it possible for the European Allies to postpone certain of their importations (mainly cereals) during the next few months, thus releasing tonnage for the supply of the American Army, on the assumption that the European Programmes could be drastically reduced and that American co-operation towards meeting the deficit on programmes so reduced could be assured in the later months of the cereal year.It was clear that in the common interest every effort should be made to increase the Allied Forces in France, and if the tonnage under both American and European control were now used in the common interest to meet the most urgent present need (the supply of the American Army) similarly that tonnage should be used in the common interest later in the year to meet the most urgent needs at that time, those needs including the supply of cereals to Europe.Mr. Baker pledged the United States Government to the policy of the common use of shipping for the common needs of the associated Governments as indicated in the Resolutions and explanatory memorandum printed on pages 3-5.Mr. Baker&apos;s speech, which obviously marks a stage of the utmost importance in the development of the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the whole of the Associated Allied Bodies (the Food and Munitions Councils and the Programme Committees), was as follows : Mr. BAKER&apos;S SPEECH.&quot; The purpose of sending the 80-Division Programme of soldiers to France is, of course, to help win the war. The determination of&quot; the 80-Division Programme in the United States was made after a very prolonged study, in which we undertook to arrive at the maximum military effort which the United States could make within the time allowed, and it was determined by careful consideration that if tonnage could be supplied, if certain arrangements could be made about artillery, and munitions, the 80 Combatant Division Programme was a possible programme. And it. was, therefore, adopted as the definite aim of the United States, subject to there being found the necessary tonnage, and to arrangements being made as to the necessary artillery and munitions.&quot;    .. . .&quot; This Council, of course, is concerned only with the transportation end of that undertaking. I think it can be said, however, that arrangements are in course of making on the other limiting factors of that programme, of such a character as too  (33) AS 6444  Pk 30  250  10/18   E&amp;S ACONFIDENTIAL. .,....,.r;, ... No, %
make it fairly likely, perhaps I might say certain, as far as human things can fee certain, that the 80-Division Programme can be carried out if the transportation and cargo tonnage can be provided.&quot; s. ,. .&quot;Now, of course, the United $tates realises that to get-additional tonnage out of the available tonnage&apos;at&apos;the disposal of the European Allies imposes&quot; serious hard-ships, calls for new limitations on the supplies and calls upon this Council, and those who, are responsible for. the diversion of these ships, to assume a very serious responsibility&apos; in the matter of invading the anticipatory use which would&quot;be made of tins tonnage now against a shortage at the end of the.cereal year.&quot; , rn;&quot;So far as the position of the United States is concerned,ot.is, as I.am.informedj k^roximatelylthisy The shipbuilding programme; of the-United States is going along well. The number of ships being turned out is increasing month by month.; As we e^timateTthe tonnage requireipents of the. American.Army; by the latter part of February it will be possible to release most; if not all, of the additional tonnage npw&quot; deemed necessary tobe,putlin for the cargo. support of the American Armyi tjnlessjsome wholly unforeseen interruption of that building programme takes place; beginning at the month of March, there willbe shipping: available, which may be; called surplus in this sense, that it will be more than is needed for the tonnage support, pf the American Army, increased as it is scheduled to increase, to attain the 80-Diyision Programme within the time specified.&quot; . .1(   , &apos;,&apos;-&apos;/ ]&quot;.&apos;.&apos;. .,.r-IC \ - The question, therefore; comes : what, arrangement will. be; equitable to be. made with regard to the use of that surplus tonnage, and the first thought that occurred to my mind-rand the first thought I am sure of; most of those, here was that if we in fact borrowed tonnage from, the European Allies for the..support of our Army until March?, then, with the available surplus tonnage, it would be wise. for us to undertake to re build.the&quot; invaded&apos; cereal supply, ton. for;; ton, until. it. was, entirely re-established. according to the original estimates, and thus make good what we had;, temporarily-borrowed, The morel haye thought of that, the more I ani satisfied that that is a narrower,view of the action of. the United States in co-operating in this matter than I should feel, justified in taking. I prefer to think of this as a cause in which we have put pur soldiers and.; in&apos;which we ought not to hesitate to put our ships for the eomniefl gopdl&apos;&apos;;.j ; h,,n ^.-11 r        ;.;     .   . - f - -.&apos;,r? : &apos; . - .iA.- &quot;Therefore, the resolution as it is drawn here, seems to me to&apos; be the correct solution of the whole problem. If it be decided that the American .80-Division Programme is a&apos;feasible programme, and can- be-carried out: without putting in jeopardy the vital-interests of any of the European-Allies, then it ought to go forward and be carried out. As soon as American shipping is in excess of the requirements Of the American Army, the &quot;surplus of that ought to be as available as the Allied shipping is now being made available for what may then seem to be the most important need of the United States and the European Allies.&quot; &apos;- - &apos;- -------:&apos;&apos;&quot; The difficulties which have obtained heretofore, I know very little about. I suspect that&apos;the width of the Atlantic is in part responsible for much of the hesitancy and uncertainty which has seemed to attend the getting of statistics and the getting of programmes from the United States. But I am entirely in accord with the views expressed by Lord Robert jDecil, that we ought to exhibit our import programmes in the Programme Committees, that we ought to be advised and informed by any counsel of those associated in the examination of those programmes; and, in the disposition of any shipping which the United States has under its control, it ought to be fully informed as to the needs of the Allies, surveyed and examined, as they would be, in a body of this sort where the one moving view of everybody is the best interest of the common cause at the moment. I think there will be no difficulty whatever in committing, the American -Government, and indeed i do commit the American Government, to that view, that the United States will inform itself, by participation in the Programme Committees and in the deliberations, of this body, as to what the needs..are,, and will, except in the exceptional cases which are enumerated in the resolution itself, be guided by the deliberations of this body in determining the disposition of its own shipping. This T say with this understanding of the case as stated&apos;. It is quite impossible, of course, for any nation to part with the control of its own shipping in the ultimate and last analysis. No: one of the European Allies would, and the United States would not in like case, part with&apos;the&quot; ultimate,right 6i /determining an interest; bf its own to be vital, even though it seemed to this Conference not tbbe^ vital&quot;wlfen&apos; compared with other needs.&quot;     : &apos; . &quot;    u .&apos;   &quot;: 1
&quot; That lias not happened in the deliberations of this body heretofore, and it does not seem to me to be likely to happen, but a reservation of the ultimate right to the disposal of the ships designated by that nation seems to me to be a necessaiy reservation, and I am glad to see it is made on behalf of the other Allies and I think it ought to be made by the United States.&quot;&quot;I think this observation ought to be made, that the 80-Division Programme will go forward and is going forward now. The men are being carried and the cargoes of supplies are being sent. This Body ought to be as &apos;foresighted as it can in regard to the 80-I)ivision Programme, and if it is going to be necessary to cut that Programme down, the warning note should be sounded as soon as possible, and we should all know it as soon as possible. If it should turn out, for instance I use these figures wholly as illustrative, and in order not to make them deceptive and still make them illustrative I make them, perhaps, absurd that the maximum use of the tonnage available permits only of a 79-DivisiDn Programme, we ought to know that just as soon as possible, because the United States will have to regard as a vital use of its shippiug the maintenance of whatever forces it has in France. That force will be 3,000 miles from home ; it will have to be supplied and maintained, and its necessary and essential supply must always remain a vital need to the United States. So that, if there is to be any later diversion of shipping from the support of the American Army, we ought to try to foresee it as soon as possible, and not to bring up a situation in which the United States would be obliged to regard the actual maintenance and essential supply of its army as a need too vital to admit of comparison with any other need that might be presented.&quot;&quot; I notice with pleasure that the right is reserved here to this Council by these Resolutions at a later time, if it should seem necessary, to suggest or recommend a modification of the 80-Division Programme. I think it is a better understanding for us to proceed upon than it would be for us, just out of hand, to agree on the 80-Division Programme, and not reserve the right of future examination. The thing ought to lie in constant examination and constant counsel.&quot;Resolutions.(a) That America should with the European Allies table her programmes of Imports for joint consideration by the Allied Programme Committees and her tonnage for similar joint consideration by the Allied Maritime Transport Council, and enable her representatives on these bodies to consider adjustments in the programmes of her imports and the allocation of her tonnage.. (6) That in order to secure (1) in the immediate future additional tonnage for the American Army Supply Service, and (2) later to meet the accumulated European, deficit and to supply commodities vitally needed by any one of the four countries, America, like the European Allies, should be guided in the arrangement of her Import Services and the disposition of her tonnage by the information and recom-mendations of the Programme Committees and the Transport Council, with the definite intention of utilising this Allied Machinery in order to achieve the objects unanimously agreed on by the Paris Conference, viz.:  (1) To make the most economical use of tonnage under the control of all the Allies,(2) To allot that tonnage as between the different needs of the Allies in such a way as to add most to the general War effort, and(3) To adjust the programmes of requirements of the different Allies in such a way as to bring them within the scope of the possible carrying power of the tonnage available.These resolutions are intended to be read with and interpreted in the light of the fuller statement of the working principles of the Allied Machinery printed on pages 4 and 5.(c) That the Council should not recommend at this moment any reduction in the embarkation of American soldiers in spite of the grave condition of the European import programmes, but should be prepared to recommend such a reduction, if necessary, in the embarkations of next year in order to meet any crisis that may. arise in the imports of food or other supplies at the time.o  AS 6444 A 2
The Council recorded their opinion (d) That in-view of the severe sacrifices that must in any event be entailed if the American military programme is continued a full statement of the position should be issued to the public of the four countries, this statement emphasising the fact that it is the supreme importance of increasing the Allied forces in France which is the reason for the sacrifices asked for, and that these sacrifices are likely to be required only during the winter and spring, the supply position being thereafter in all probability greatly improved.(e) That the Council, having before it the following provisional allocations of tonnage for arrival from September to December, inclusive, viz.: -Food, including Military Oats, 7 million tons, Munitions and Raw Materials, 9 million tons,recommends that approximately 500,000 tons be diverted from the above allocation for the American Army programme for October, November, and December, including the 200,000 tons already arranged, but in addition to any further space that can be provided by the release of double bottoms. &apos;The exact quantity of tonnage to be allotted to the American Army supply programme is to be subject to further consideration in the light of later information as to the immediate needs of the American Army in relation to the requirements of other services.Mr. Baker observed that the Resolution would be regarded as subject to the general sense of his speech, and that in the last resort the carrying out of the 80-.Division Programme must depend on the. amount of tonnage available in Europe and America.Fullkr Statement of the Working Principles of Allied Machinery.The European Allies desire to make it clear that the reduction in their tonnage threatens them with the definite prospect of a shortage of munition supplies, and of food in the latter part of the cereal year. This shortage will be rendered more serious and will be felt earlier if tonnage is now allotted by them for the American Army service. In practice tonnage can now only be so allotted by leaving behind breadstuffs in America, and. a shortage of bread, apart from sufficient assistance: by America later,, appears inevitable. The European Allies therefore cannot take the responsibility of diverting tonnage from food supplies without adequate assurance for the future. At the same time, looking at the Allied position as a whole, it. appears right that during the winter (when the recent harvests are still in hand) a, preference should be given in the allocation of tonnage to the conveyance of army supplies and munitions which must be brought in now if they are to help the fighting of the early summer. It follows that a; similar&apos; preference must, as and when it. proves necessary,, be given later in the year to food. The European Allies are anxious to consider America&apos;s problem as their own on the basis of full and equal, partnership, and on this basis are now allotting, tonnage for the American Army service. This can only safely be done if America will similarly identify herself with the European Allies and regard their problem also as her own. This means in, practice identifying herself with the Allied machinery of the Allied Maritime Transport Council and the associated Allied, bodies with the definite intention of having her programmes of imports and her services requiring tonnage tabled for joint Allied consideration with those of France, Italy, and Great Britain, and of making her tonnage with that of the three European Allies available to meet the most important needs of any of the four countries.The executive control of her ships would of course be reserved for America as for the other countries. But what is desired is that America, like Ureat. Britain, should (subject to the reservation of that, ultimate right) co-operate in the general Allied machinery with the definite intention of making her ships, like the others, available where it is agreed that the need is from time to time the greatest. &apos;  :In order that the Allied co-operation may be effective it is necessary that the representatives of the-:several. countries on the different Programme Committees should    &apos; ; ; -(a) produce their full programmes ;
(6) be fully informed of their Governments&apos; policy and be able to discuss the programme in relation to the other programmes, and within reasonable limits assigned by their Governments, assent to modifications of the programme;(c) that so far as any Government feel bound to take a different view as to their own requirements in relation to those of the other Allies, they should normally express that dissent through their representatives on the Com-mittees and not, except in extreme cases, by dissenting later from a recommendation of the Committee to which their representatives had assented;id) that in any case each Government should only make their final decision after careful consideration of the report of the Programme Committees and of their representatives on them; and(e) that, subject to such dissent and to the ultimate executive power over their own ships, each country should definitely declare their intention of arranging the allocation of their vessels in accordance with the general programmes of the four countries as a whole, as and so far as they may be agreed by the different representatives.The European Allies feel that from every point of view the full acceptance of such a principle and method of co-operation by America, based upon the needs of the four countries as they develop, is a more satisfactory assurance for the future than an arrangement in the nature of a bargain based upon the extent of the assistance now given. They feel bound, however, in reviewing the ensuing cereal year as a whole, to state that they have not been able to effect a reduction in their own programmes below the total importations which can be conveyed on present estimates in the tonnage now under their control. That is, in arranging the immediate allocation of tonnage to America or the provision of such commodities as artillery and munitions which necessitate importation, the European Allies are doing so in the belief that the application of the above principles will be likely to result in approximately as great an allocation of tonnage assistance to Europe later in the cereal year. Later it is of&apos; course hoped that the prospective improve-ment in the general Allied tonnage position, resulting from the large increase in American building, will, under the operation of the above principles, enable the Allied supplies generally to be raised above the dangerous level to which they must necessarily be kept down for the present.Lancaster House,12th October 1918.
