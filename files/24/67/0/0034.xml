I circulate the following notes which have been prepared in the Intelligence and Statistics Section of the Ministry of Munitions on the labour position in munition industries.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.                                                                     I.-STRIKES.                                                                          Statistics for Week Ending the 9th October 1918.                                         During the week ending the 9th October an unusual number of small strikes took place, several of which lasted for only a few hours. The total number of days lost through strikes by munition workers*was, however, only 17,016, or one-ninth of 1 per cent, of the possible working time. The most important loss of time occurred at the National Aircraft Factory, Aintree, where 3,000 workers lost 4,500 days.                                   II.-DIFFICULTIES IN THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY.                                             Dilution and Training.                                                                      The objection of woodworkers and sheet-metal workers to the employment of women is making it difficult to secure placings for women who have been trained in the schools under the direction of the Ministry of Munitions. Women who cannot secure employment with private firms are to some extent engaged on productive work in the training establishments, but this tends to cause congestion and to prevent the admission of new candidates for training. The difficulty of employing women on aircraft work has been felt most acutely in the Manchester and South-Western districts. +                                                          Payment by Results.                                                                         The aircraft woodworkers who are impeding output by refusing to allow women to perform certain operations are even more obstinate in declining to allow their members to be stimulated to greater effort by payment by results. The National Woodworkers&apos; Aircraft Committee is bound by an agreement of the 22nd October 1917 not to interfere with existing systems of payment by results. In spite of this, the unions represented on the Committee are now threatening to expel any of their members who remain on or accept such systems unless they have been accepted by a majority of the aircraft woodworkers, not in the establishment concerned, but in the district.$ The Ministry has found it necessary to warn the Committee that such interference is regarded as a violation of Section 4 (3) of the Munitions of War Act, 1915, and, being illegal, will be resisted by such means as the Ministry commands.                             * For the purpose of these statistics munition workers are taken to include all classes of workers in respect of whom the Ministry of Munitions would intervene in the event of a strike (a) in the munition industries proper (metals, chemicals and rubber); and (b) in certain auxiliary industries, eg., iron ore mining, brick-making, timber-sawing, "certified" gas and electricity undertakings, &amp;c.                                                               + The Aircraft Woodworkers&apos; Committee at Belfast ordered the employees of a firm which was employing women to cease work on the 5th October. In this case, however, the men unanimously refused to comply with the Committee&apos;s instructions.                                          $ A payment by results scheme is in operation in a National Aircraft Factory at Liverpool. Sub-contracts for wings have been placed by this National Factory with two other establishments in the city, and the workers in both of these have come out on strike rather than handle material for the men working under the payment by results scheme.                 a  (33)6640-3   Pk 50   125   10/18   E &amp; S
iii.-releases prom the colours.Attention was drawn in these Notes for the 26th June to the difficulties which might be anticipated in maintaining the output of munitions in face of the drain upon manpower occasioned by the needs of the army for men. These anticipations have, in some instances, been justified by the event. The shortage of certain classes of labour in war industries of the highest importance has become so marked that it has been found necessary to reclaim men from service with the Colours. Difficulty has been experienced, in particular, in the operation of blastfurnaces, the production of stampings and forgings, of tanks, guns, and scientific instruments. The War Cabinet have already recognised the urgency of the problem and have sanctioned the release from the Colours of a specified number of men fitted for work of certain classes. Arrangements have been made for bringing back at the earliest possible moment 1,325 men born in 1898-99, of whom 400 are to be employed on blastfurnace work,, 400 on stampings and forgings, 325 on tanks, and 200 on Admiralty instruments. In addition the release of 300 older men has been sanctioned for work on stampings and forgings. It will be necessary, however, to consider the question of releases on a larger scale, and to make further proposals to the War Cabinet, if the present munition programme is to be carried out.
