THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT3ECr *]T, 2.T.6064.TO CABINET.SHIPPING CONDITIONS OF AN ARMISTICE.Letter dated Oct. l8, 1918 from tho Socrotary ef tho Ministry of Shipping to the Secretary of the &quot;Var Cabinet.&quot;On the assumption that the conditions cf an armistice will in essentials represent the ultimate peace conditions and will he such as to preclude the possibility of the resumption of hostilities, there are two demands which tho Controller thinks should be considered.The first is that Germany should be required formally to notify the neutral Governments of the world and particularly these of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland that all restrictions placed on tho trading pf their vessels with tho allies, whether by tho Government er by private Gorman interests and whether in return for specific concessions Buch as the export of shipbuilding material or not, are immediately cancelled.This may bo of very groat practical importance from the point of view of our Scandinavian supplies.     Danish ships practically all come here in ballast as a price of obtaining German safeconducts and while there may npt be much in Denmark which they could bring they would be very useful in mooting eur present heavy demands for timber from Sweden,,     Sweden is under an obligation to Germany not to let us have more than 400,000 tons of her shipping in our service, and there are also a number of Norwegian ships built of German materials which are debarred from trading in our interests.-Tho second is that Germany should be required to deliver immediatoft ly at a Swedish port the British shipping interned in Germany.&quot;haveWhitehall Gardens, S.W.I. &quot;October 22nd, 1918.
