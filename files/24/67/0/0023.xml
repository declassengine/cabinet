(1).tyTp,........This Document Is the Property of*&amp;*ktMj Ji^------ His Britannic IVIaiesty^s Government16th October, 1318Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood&apos; Production Department for the week ended 15th October, 1918:-The Weather and Condition of Props.Heavy rain which fell on Tuesday and Wednesday interrupted work &quot;in many districts, but on the whole there was a slight improvement in the&apos; weather experienced during the past week, the week-end being fine.In the Midlands and in the south of England, harvesting operations have been practically completed;   some corn is still in stook in the north.Autumn cultivation, owing to the weather,&apos; Is&apos; generally much behindhand, and considerable difficulty is being experienced in lifting potatoes on heavy land.     In some places, chiefly in Gloucestershire, potatoes in the ground are being attacked by slugs.On the pasture land there is an abundance of keep, but the poor quality of the grass and the rough weather recently experienced have hot been conducive-to the well doing of stock.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION,&quot;&quot; Agricultural Executive Committees.   . Dorset.   The Committee have had under observation for some time a 200 acre farm at Cerne Abbas,&apos; and have now come to the conclusion that if the land is to yield an adequate contribution to the food
supply It will be necessary for them to take possession of the farm.     The tenant is a hardworking man, but ?;ithout sufficient capital or business experience to cultivate the farm properly. The Committee have been authorised to take possession, though it is possible that they may employ the tenant as their agent to manage the farm under their supervision, -Herefordshire,   The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 477 acres at Bishops Prome, which is in a very neglected state.    The owner-occupier, who inherited the land in a heavily mortgaged state, is without the necessary capital to farm it properly.    The Committee have made every effort to induce him to accept pecuniary and other assistance, but as all their offers have been refused, the Board and the Committee felt there was no other course.open to them,in &quot;the interests,of food production, but for the Committee to take possession of the farm (with the exception/of the dwelling-house) and to arrange for its adequate cultivation. Sussex, East.   A farm of 142 acres at Alboume has been under the observation of the Committee for a very considerable time, but though In September 1917 the owner-occupier gave an under-taking to Improve materially the condition of the farm, no improvement has taken place and the land is deteriorating rapidly,.,.  The owner lives at a distance, and seldom visits . the farmj, which is reported to.be very foul, and overrun with couch, noxious grasses and thistles.    The Committee have, therefore, been authorised to take possession and to arrange for the adequate cultivation of the farm.Cases settled by Arbitration. A farm of 89 acres consisting of .very fine fenland had been allowed by the owner to become derelict The Isle of Ely Agricultural Executive Committee accordingly tooK possession of the farm in July, 1917, and put it under the manage
of a local farmar who acted as their agent.    With the consent of the Committee the owner sold half tho farm and let the remainder on lease, in each case to a reliable farmer, and the Committee withdrew from possession in November.    As they were unable to agree with the owner as to the sum he should pay them under Paragraph 4 of Regulation 2M for their acts of cultivation, the matter went to arbitration, and the arbitrator has fixed the amount at  238. 5s. lid. This is the first case of the kind to be settled by arbitration. Proseout ions.  A farmer in Devon has been fined  10 for failure to comply with a cultivation order, and a-farmer in the West Riding of Yorkshire has been fined  50 for a similar offence. Damage by Game.    Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Hampshire.Drainage.   Great derate having been caused to agricultural lan&amp; owing to the rising of Lake Grasmere the Westmorland Agricultural Executive Committee -undertook last June the cleansing of the River Rothay which forms the outfall of the lake.    The Committee now report that in addition to removing the deposit from the channel of the river they have been able to widen the outlet from 18 to 55 feet, and have also constructed ft dam across the river by which means it is hoped to keep the lake at normal level.    A stream which formerly discharged into the lake has been diverted and will in future discharge into the river.    It is hoped that by this work future damage to agricultural land in the vicinity will be prevented. *Determination of Tenancies.    During the week 1 Order has been made by the Board determining a tenancy on account of bad farming in respect of 242 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION Provision of Land, for Allotments.  During the week 10 local authorities have agreed to acquire 124 acres (1,776 allotments), Including 38 acres at Castleford and 37 acres at Hastings.
Six appeals against orders to quit have been dealt with and arrangements have boon wade for 206 allotment holders to continue their tenancy of a total acreage of 102 acres.At Tonbridge 90% of the 3*200 householders possess cultivated gardens, while, in addition, there are 2,000 allotment averaging 10 rods eaoh.During the week claims for compensation have been dealt with involving 27 acres.  188.3.5d. waa claimed and  117.13.94* recommended in settlement.foult Sect ion.  Fruit orchards in Huntingdon and at Rampton in Carabs.  have been inspeoted.   A meeting of the treat Oambs. FruitS Growers1 Association has been attended and arrangements made for a demonstration on pruning to be held at the end of the month i Marketing.  Mottin^ham.  The registration of a County Marketing Society was decided upon at a large meeting held In Nottingham   I recently.   A central depot will be established in the county town with sub-depots at Mansfield. Worksop, Retferd and Kewark. and smaller depots at bther places.Leicester,    The produce available in this county is not considered sufficient to warrant the formation of a Sooiety, I but the Horticultural Sub-Committee have made arrangements to handle any produce which is available.Live Stock, The rabbit breeding scheme has been taken up by nea every county s and in some counties as many as 10 centres have bee formed*TgOHKICALDIVISIOM. Inspection of Land,    Formats Farm, Horth Re&amp;ton, taken over by the Lindsey Agricultural Executive Committee in 1917, has been. Inspected.    The farm, which extends to 750 acres (400 arable)   I was greatly neglected by the previous tenant.    Since its occupati by the Committee over 100 acres of grass land have been broken, and the ruaainder of the furm cleaned and improved, with! tho result that this year it is expected that the production of i grain on this farm will be 10 times as great as in the last yearj of the previous tenant1 s occupation.m 4 **
Utilisation of Badly-Damaged Grain.   A report has been submitted of tests made at Leeds with regard to the feeding value of badly sprouted grain crops, taken straight from the field and used without any drying.    The tests were made with 16 cows and 2 horses, and lasted seven days.     It was found that on the whole the animals consumed the material readily, and apparently without digestive trouble or loss of efficiency, Antl^Rook Mixtures.   An Interim report has been submitted of experiments carried out at the Rothamsted Experimental Station with various seed dressings (including proprietary dressings) which might be used as a protection against birds.Further experiments are in progress. LABOUR DIVISION.Harvest Labour.    The number of soldiers specially released for harvest work and still out on farms is 5,127.The Commandants of Agricultural Distribution.Centres have nOw been authorised to grant a further extension of 14 days&apos; agricultural furlough where necessary for the ingathering of the remainder of the harvest or for harvesting the potato crop to those soldiers who have been released from the Home Forces for harvest work.Ploughmen for Autumn Cultivation.   The War Office have arranged for the release, on two months&apos; agricultural furlough, for ploughing work in England and tfales, of 2,500 skilled soldier ploughmen.    These men will be sent to their county of origin. Prisoners of War.   1,186 further prisoners of war were voted to the Department this week,With regard to the scheme for the provision of migratory gangs of prisoners of war for threshing and other agricultural work, the War Office have arranged that migratory gangs formed from non-agricultural working camps should, where
required, be replaced as far as possible from prisoners now    n available or who subsequently beoome available in parent camps,I The total number of prisoners to be supplied for these gangs from parent camps will not exceed the number originally supplied by non-agricultural working camps, and since withdrawWomenVa Branch,Forage Section.   It has been decided that women working under the Forage Department shall no longer form a section of the Lanj Armyi and after November 30th the Selection Boards set up by the Women&apos;s War Agricultural Committees will cease to select women for this work.   The Women1s Land Army, therefore, will in future consist only of the Agricultural Section and the Timber Cutting Section.Training.   An interesting report has&apos;been received on the workof several of the women in the Land Army in West Sussex.    TheFarm Director at Wye College commenting on an Efficiency Testwhich he judged, states;-   &quot;Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the milking tests was the fact that the majority of the candidates paid special attention to cleanliness. Only a very few commenced milking without taking every precaution to prevent contamination of the milk&quot;.i,&quot;As future employees In dairy herds, the methods adopted by these workers will have far-reaching effects in the production of pure milk, and much credit Is due to those who were responsible for their training.&quot;With regard to carting, he stated;-   &quot;The candidates who -  entered for this test acquitted themselves extremely well, and gave evidence of having freen carefully trained, Many of the girls showed efficiency In general horsemanship) equal to that of the average farm carter, and if due allowance were made for difference in physique, they are just as capable.&quot;He concludes by saying that one of the most pleasingof his observations was the fact that the unwarranted prejudicof the average farmer with regard to women labour is rapidlydisappearing.An Efficiency Test was held during the past week in &apos; Gloucestershire, and out of the nineteen candidates who enteredn only one failed.
Welfare.   Several club3 for women of the Land Army have been started in Essex and Hertfordshire.   The clubs are run by the girls themselves and supported by their employers.   The Hertford County Council has been approached with a view to getting school rooms and institutes for use as clubs, rent free.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme.   The following statement shows the position with regard to the provision of tractors, machinery and implements for the week ended 12th October, 1918:-*No. consigned    Total No. during week.    with counties.Tractors67(1 withdrawn)4,291Ploughs...........   -      76      - 5,332During the week ended 27th September, 21,937 acres were ploughed,, 247 acres were cross ploughed and 3,409 acres cultivated. Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during the past week was as follows:- ploughed 10,580* cultivated 7,132, harrowed 959, mole-drained 94.   Total 18,765 acres.Harvest work.   Two additional threshing machines have been supplied to County Executive Committees during the week, making the total number so consigned to date 350.Some weeks ago Corporations, Rural District Qouncils and other similar bodies were approached by the Department with a view to arranging for the loan to threshing contractors of engines and skilled engine drivers in the employment of local authorities..   As a result offers have been received ,vhich will make available for this purpose 11 engines and 21 drivers.   Arrangements for the employment of these engines and drivers will be made by the respective County Executive Committees.SUPPLIES DIVISION. Sulphate of Ammonia.   The production of sulphate of ammonia in September wa3 up to the average, but deliveries have since fallen off, presumably owing to farmers being busy ;vith the harvest.   The
future supply of sulphate of ammonia g&amp;ves rise&apos; to&apos; some&apos;.anxiety a tho output-will be smaller owing to the reduction Ih&apos;the manufact of gas, while at the same time the requirements of the&apos;Ministry -Munitions, are increasing; &apos; &apos; .&apos;  v*- - ;--&apos;  &apos; * \   &quot;v &apos;&apos;&apos;Army; Manure. The arrangements made early in the year for removil stable manure from the dump, at Eelmooi^, near Aldershot have been /working: satisfactorily, but a breakdown;&apos;itfas &quot;recently&apos; threatened I to the defective condition,of the Baaingstoke Canal.&apos; &apos;Ar rang erne n have now been made whereby the price paid to the -Sar Office for manure will be reduced from 4s.6d. to 2s.6d. per ton, while the to the consumer will be raised from 4s.6d. to 5s. The profit (2j per ton) thus obtained will be applied to the repair of the Cana ;-as.. to enable the &apos;barge3 to -continue working throughout the winte Lime.- The&quot;arrangements, recently&apos; made for the distribution of li ..in ,the south western counties of England are working satisf actor but owing .to-increases in the cost of coal arid in wages, it will shortly be necessary&apos; to raise&apos;the price from. 21s.6d.&apos; to 23s.&apos;6d&apos;. ton. It has also been necessary to; increase the price of the limestone which is- being produced at Croydon from 12s.6d. to 15 ton in order to cover the cost of fuel used in drying the lime during the winter.Testing -of Seeds Order.-- Evidence of the excellent results of t Testing of Seeds- Order is frequently&apos;being brought to the notic the Department. Large quantities of&apos;clover seed are being disp of. for feeding purposes which would otherwise have been sold fb; seed. Grass seed of&apos;low germination-is beinglsold for poultry&apos; feeding,&apos;and quantities&apos; of &quot;root&apos;seeds are being crushed because disclosure of their&apos;low germination makes&quot;their sale for seed purposes impossible. The effect &quot;on cereals may be judged by tto large and increasing number of samples of wheat, barley, oats a rye which are being sent for testing to the official Seed ,Testi Station.Prices of Root Seeds.   The wholesale seed houses have not yet *l
stabilised prices for root seeds for the coming season, but the general tendency is to place them much lower than they were last year. Turnip, which has been an excellent crop, will probably be on an average about 85s. per bushel, as compared .vith 120s. last year, (Green Globe Turnip is being mentioned at as low as 56s* per bushel), and mangold will be about 138s, per&apos;owt- as compared with 220s   last year. The swede crop has varied very much, being good in some parts of the country and bad in others,- and the prices will not show much reduction, probably an average of 110s. per bushel as against 112s.6d. last year.Seed Potatoes.   The final arrangements have now been made and the prices fixed for the distribution of the second early and late immune varieties of potatoes grown by the Department under contract in Scotland.Seed Tftieat.   Reports received from the Seed Testing Station regarding the germination of samples of seed wheat selected for distribution under the Department^ scheme, have so far been very satisfactory. Several samples have given 100 per cent, germination. Wart Disease.   The careful survey by the wart disease and spraying staffs of each county in order to ascertain the extent to which wart disease is present, is being carried out systematically,   Reports received up to the present indicate that the disease is present in many districts where it has not been notified, and in many cases has not been suspected.Spraying.   Reports have been received from a farm in the Cambridge fens that field crops of &quot;King Edward&quot;, &quot;Evergood&quot; and &quot;Ally&quot; varieties on being lifted last week showed on an average not more than %$ of blighted tubers. Nevertheless, there are indications that 30me varieties of potatoes are not likely to keep well during the present season.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, Director-General.% RtrHon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P., President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
