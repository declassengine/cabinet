[This Document is the Property of His Britannic KLajesty&apos;s Government.] *Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.SECRET.G.T.60C9   IXMote &quot;by the Minister of Blockade.I SUBMIT for consideration a memorandum on the policy to be followed in the event of a return convoy from the Netherlands East Indies to Holland.    . . .-i r- j i      r\   J.       -i r, -i ri 1 1111; 0- * /    JJ *16th licit ,i/Ji.8 ____.____.The fact that various announcements have recently appeared in the Dutch press as to the probable return of the Dutch convoy, and the nature of the cargo to be carried makes it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide what policy they will adopt if the homeward convoy actually sails. Several important questions arise in this connection.Before dealing with them it will be convenient to state the conditions on which His Majesty&apos;s government finally consented to allow the passage of the outward convoy.   These conditions were as follows : (a.) A detailed list of all passengers to be furnished, none but Dutch Governmentofficials and their families to sail. (6.) Full particulars of all cargo to be supplied in the same way as is now doneby the Netherlands Oversea Trust in respect of ships under their control, (c.) The Netherlands Government to give a formal guarantee that no goodsshipped in the convoy are either wholly or in part of enemy origin, (c/.) The ships sailing under the Dutch naval flag, including the converted liner,not to carry any civilian passengers, nor any goods or articles other thanwarlike stores for the colonial authorities or forces, of which complete listsshould be furnished.(e.) No mails, correspondence, private papers, printed matter, or parcels to be carried by any ship in the convoy (except official despatches of the Dutch Government).(/.) The convoy not to sail until the above stipulated particulars and undertakings have been furnished, and have been found satisfactory by the British authorities.The following questions arise in regard to the homeward convoy: 1. Shall we bring the vessels into port to exercise the right of visit and search (a.) In spite of the Dutch claim of a right of convoy. (6.) In respect of cargo carried under the naval flags ?2. What action shall be taken in regard to the ex-German vessels transferred to the Dutch flag in compensation for the Dutch vessels sunk last year, and likely to be included in the homeward convoy ?3. If a general agreement with Holland has not been reached, what action are we to take if it is found that the only cargo on board consists of innocent cargo consigned-(a.) Either to the Netherlands Oversea &quot;Crust; or [b. To the Netherlands Government ?4. Are we prepared to insist on bringing vessels into port if resistance is threatened or actually made&apos;?These questions are dealt with below in succession.(1.)-(a.) His Majesty&apos;s Government made in June last, prior to the sailing of the convoy on its outward journey, the most emphatic declaration of their refusal to recognise the so-called &quot; right of convoy.&quot;   It is true that, on this particular occasion, they waived, on certain conditions, the actual exercise of their right of search, but they [875]P
notified the Netherlands Minister that this must be regarded &quot;as an act of courtesy,&quot; and proceeded to &quot;lay stress on the altogether exceptional nature of such a concession, which must not be treated as a precedent for similar concessions in future, nor held to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government in any way to the abandonment of their just claims on other occasions.&quot;   (See White Paper &quot; Miscellaneous No. 13 (1918),&quot; p. 9.)When the Dutch press began recently to speak of the return of the convoy, His Majesty&apos;s Government -repeated their warning with ,emphasis. Iii an official note to the Netherlands Government, dated the Oth September last, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at The Hague notified them that the conditional waiver of the right of search applied to the outward journey only. Sir W. Town ley proceeded : &quot;Should any further attempt be made to transport passengers and goods under convoy, His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to exercise their full right of search.&quot;If, therefore, any attempt is made to bring back merchant vessels from the East Indies under convoy of warships with a view to evading our right of search, it is clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully committed to resisting such a manoeuvre, and it seems difficult to believe that the Dutch would make such an attempt.ib.) There is also the possibility that the Dutch may try to bring home cargo under the naval flag. One of the vessels which composed the outward convoy, the stemiship &quot; Tabanan,&quot; was a merchant vessel which the Netherlands Government &quot; converted &quot; shortly before her sailing into an &quot; auxiliary cruiser.&quot; There would seem to be no practical difficulty about &quot; converting &quot; any number of other merchant vessels, iDeluding perhaps the ex-German ships, into &quot; auxiliary cruisers.&quot; The &quot;Tabanan&quot; carried cargo on her outward journey, and, as we are well aware, the Netherlands Government claim the right to carry goods required for the public service on their warships The battleship &quot; Hertog Hendrik &quot; some months ago carried out a wireless installation of German manufacture to the East Indies. When this came to our know-ledge Sir W. Towniey was instructed to inform the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs that &quot; if the Netherlands Government claim the right to use their war vessels as carriers of merchandise, they cannot justly ask His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend to them the privileges and facilities which they at present receive as ships of war.&quot;If His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to resist the carriage of merchandise, exempt from search, on Dutch warships, it might be advisable to remind the Kether-kinds Government of the above warning, and to say plainly that we regard vessels-which carry merchandise and passengers under the naval flag as subject to the exercise of our right of visit and search in the same way as ordinary merchant ships. Our warning might include special reference to the &quot;Tabanan.&quot;2. The position in regard to the transfer of German ships to the Dutch flag in compensation for torpedoed Dutch vessels is as follows : In reply to a request from the Netherlands Government that we would recognise this transfer we stipulated in August 1917 for certain conditions. These conditions were revised in June 1918, and are still before the Netherlands Government in the following form :-(a.) That corresponding vessels now in Holland should be time-chartered to the Allies for the period of the war for service outside the war zone.(6.) That the transfer should be absolute, no enemy interest remaining in the vessels.(c.) That the German cargoes on hoard should be discharged in the Dutch East Indies.In September the Dutch press announced completion of the transfer, and reports were received of preparations for survey and insurance of the vessels. His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires was consequently instructed to remind the Netherlands Government of our conditions, and warned that if the vessels sailed before the conditions were accepted the responsibility for any resulting loss or inconvenience would rest with the Netherlands Government. His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires reported that in reply to this warning the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he fully realised that the ships could not be used until the conditions of transfer had been settled. His Excellency suggested informally that the employment of these vessels might be settled during negotiations for a general agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply adhered to their original attitude. ,The Admiralty anticipate an attempt by the Netherlands Government to include these vessels in the homeward convoy.
IIn view of what has passed it is suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adhere to the conditions already demanded, and if these conditions are not fulfilled should seize the vessels as prize. No other course seems open as we cannot admit the right of neutrals to arrange such transfers of flags without our consent.3. Our policy has been that no goods should be .allowed into Holland until a general agreement has been reached : -(a.) Under existing arrangements ;with&apos;:the Netherlands Oversea Trust ho cargo can be shipped without our previous approval. If, therefore, any goods are found on board consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust they would have been shipped in violation of the agreements with the Trust, and their detention would be justified.(6.) Cargoes for the Netherlands Government present a somewhat more serious difficulty, and it might be advisable at once to warn the Netherlands Government of the danger which would arise from an. attempt to&apos;convoy &apos; merchant ships with such goods on board.The general policy of refusing the passage of goods to Holland until the conclusion of an agreement is quite consistent with what has been done in the case of the Scandinavian countries by ourselves and the United States. The United States adopted this embargo policy over a year ago as a measure for securing agreements, and neutral vessels were detained for a long time in Allied ports in consequence. No new factor would be created therefore by the mere detention of these ships as far as blockade policy is concerned.   It is suggested therefore that detention would be justified.4. The question whether we shall insist on our present attitude in the face of any resistance or threatened resistance on the part of the Dutch is partly a naval and chiefly a political question, and requires decision accordingly.
