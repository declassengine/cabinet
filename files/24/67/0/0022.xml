Land Division.all Holding Colonies *forHplbeaoh.   Potato ploughing and carting and horse ploughing : other&quot;&quot;crops Ts proceedingo    The wet weather is hindering potato-lifting but as much as possible is being done, most of the men and all the women taking part*ffatrington.   The weather has continued unsettled *    The harvest is practically all in at Bleak House, Newlands, Channel and Wood Paras, with the exception of a few acres of oats at Bleak House which will be cleared direotly they are dry*     There arc still about 100 a0 es Of wheat and 20 acres of beans at East Bank to get in.     As soon as the, gathering of the crops on the fother farms has been completed, the whole of the available labour will be diverted to East Bank to complete the &apos; Clearing up of ttyit farm.The cr*p3 , produce and stock disposed of during the week included over 19 tons of straw, 16 bullocks realising  578. 15* 2., 207 pints of milk and 495 eggs.Heath Hill-     The weather still continues to hinder the farming operations, the rainfall for the week being 0*718 inches.    When weather has permitted, all hands have been engaged.in potato lifting, and some 2$ acres have been raised and clamped down during the weeke Another case of Wart Disease has been detected on the Colony and duly reported, the variety attacked being King Edward VII.ham Estate.The Estate Committee of Management are considering what land in the Rolleston area might be taken ever next April when the present notices expire, and whether in the event of such land being farmed by the Committee, the present tenants might be resettled.The tenants are being consulted as to what proposals they are prepared to make in the event of notices to quit not being enforoed, the obj ect being to prepare next year for as large an area of sugar beet as possible on the whole estate, should the turn of the war enable the sugar beet programme of the Committee to be accelerated.    Apart frrm this, it is felt that if the farms occupied by tenants are to be taken in hand, this should take place as early as possible, as any imprrvemcnt in the farming of the Estate as a whole cannot be expected if the tenants allowed to remain in possession cannot look forward to remain in their holdings beyond one year.Tithe, Qopyhold. Commons and Survey Branch.During the past week 1 Enfranchisement of Copyhold, and 3 Redemptions and 7 Altered Apportionments of Tithe Rentcharge have been completed, while 4 Applications for Merger, 7 for Redemption, 4 for Altered Apportionment of Tithe Rentcharge, and 9 for the Enfranchisement of Copyhold have been received.

Two further reports were received by the Board, &quot;&quot;brie&quot; of &quot;which,&quot; on a farm adjoining the premises at Burwash on which the original outbreak occurred, was confirmed.

Nineteen further reports were received from the Devonshire and Cornwall Area, of which 11 were confirmed.    A Press Notice was issued on the 11th inst. warning the public to the serious risk of the further spread of Rabies and ttte need of co-operation between the public and the Authorities in securing the observance of the &apos;  Regulations requiring the muzzling and control of dogs in the Area affected and restricting the movement of dogs out of Devon and Cornwall.There is nothing of special interest to record as to other animal diseases.This Branch as a separate arm of the Board&apos;a activity ceased with tho resignation of Mr. H.S. Cautley, M.P., - the result of the announcement that concentrated feeding stuffs would not be available for pig feeding after Xmas, and that pig keepers who could not find sufficient food for their pigs in other directions would have no alternative but to slaughter.   What work is possible is being continued for the time being in the Animals Division.The reports from the Committee&apos;s local Representatives bear full tistimony to the fact that the turning back of fat stock at markets is causing considerable trouble to graziers, owing chiefly to their inability to keep the animals in condition while waiting for a marketo    The continuance of this state of affairs must inevitably lead to loss of meat to the country.The opinion ia generally expressed that, in view of tho shortage of food for pigs, it is necessary to remove the weight restriction on the sale of pigs for slaughter.The Deputy Director has attended a Meeting of tho County and I     District Representatives held at the Shire Hall, Worcester, on Saturday, October 12th.Pig Production Branch.Joint Committee of the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food.
