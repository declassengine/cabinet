ffi &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;       I. &apos;    .^      tI(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI?. BRITAN;&apos;!IC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)SECR B.I. WAR CABINET.a. T. 6050.MEMORANDUM BY LORD ROBERT CECIL.MEMORANDUM ON RUSSIAfl POLICY.If     The original purposes of our Intervention In Russia were(1) to prevent our enemies from drawing supplies and assistance from Russian territory, and(2) if possible to reconstitute a Russian front. Later on, after the Czechs^ came on the scene we were anxious to help them and the other elements in Russia such as Alexeioff and his followers who had remained friendly to our cause.- So long as the war goes on those objects remain and we must continue to urge our allies other than the United States &apos;to join us in working for them.&apos;If,.however, an,Armistice is concluded with the Central Powers, though.we.shall still wish tc help the Czechs and our Russian friends., our other and earlier objects will no longer exist.     On the other hand we receive constant telegrams sayin.fr that if the Germans withdraw from the occupied districts.in Russia, including Poland, their withdrawal will be    . followed by ai. outbreak of Bolshevism with the consequent chaos and destruction. &apos; This is probably true.     It is certainly being diligently put about by the Germans with a view to their remaining In the Russian occupied districts.     It is, indeed, part of their policy tc dominate if they can the neighbouring districts of Russia politically and commercially after the War.     Should they succeed In doing so they will not only command the Baltic but may very likely become commercially If not politically paramount in.the whole of European and ultimately Asiatic Russia also with all its Incalculable resources.     Apart from this It will be ai grave misfortune if the rich districts of Russia suchas middle and Western Siberia, the Don,basin and thea Caucasus not to speak of the Ukraine are sterilised foryears by revolution.I submit therefore that the general object to which our policy should be directed on the conclusion of the Armistice must be to maintain in those districts which now have an orderly existence and a friendly population as good and stable a Government as possible. I assume that it would be impossible for several reasons to maintain any British force in Russia after an armistice at least for fighting purposes.   But I suggest that we ought to support with money and arms as far as we can any \ Government in Siberia which has a chance of surviving and i no ought in tho same way to help to sot on its logn a I national Government in each of the Baltic States end ..fcf - 1 :v;e can roaoh It, in Poland, alrso.
Aloxoioff and his friends soon to Too concentrated in tho North Cauoasus.     In that case, wo can reach then through the Black Boa when that is opened.     Whethor there is anything to hope from then we shall then ho able to ascertain.     If so, wo should encourage and assist thon to establish themselves with the Georgians as tho rulers of the North and South Caucasus.     If they are as incom-potont as other Russian Govcrnmontt/we could at least offer to help &apos; those who wished it to leave the country.As for the Czechs, if they desire to leave Russia, I should ho inclined to advocate their withdrawal as and when that is possi-hlc, by agreement with the Soviet Governments.I am entirely opposed to anything like a crusade against Bol-shovism whether by sending forces if we had them into Russia or even by erecting as is contemplated by some people a ring fenae round European Russia.     It is probably true that the policy I have sketched above might have that effect at any rate to some extent but I do not advocate it on that ground,     It would follow that we should not remain in Occupation of Murmansk or Archangel any moro than of Vladivostok though it might conceivably bo desirable to remain at Murmansk until the Peace Congress and would probably be inevitable for shipping reasons,II.   I look with grave apprehension -rhat ever we may do, te the fate of the small Baltic States brought into existence by the Germans.     Their present frontiers are doubtless intentionally drawn so as to destroy their homogeneity, but it will not bo possi-ble to avoid some mixture of races in each of them.     For that reason as well, as because of their youth and inexperience they cannot be anything but very weak for many years to come,     1-cr am I able to believe as some do, that they can be given a Polish orientation to support them for I expect the Poles will have all they can possibly do to look after themselves.     It may well there-fore bo that those States will tend to lean upon Germany.     Finland has already shown that tendency and since it will be very difficult for the Western Powers to come to the aid of Esthonia, Latvia and Lituania, they may easily follow Finland&apos;s example,     The only remfcdy appears to be to fodter as far as we can tho creation of -a Scandinavian block to which tho now States would turn for assist-ance and it is for that reason that I welcome the suggestion that Sweden should send troops to Esthonia to keep order there though it is very doubtful if she will do it.In this memorandum I have not attempted to deal with questions of boundaries difficult as they are, because they must in my view be left for settlement by experts, nor have I said anything about the Ukraine because I do not see how wo can for the present do any-thing to help or hinder in that country.(initialled)   R.C,
