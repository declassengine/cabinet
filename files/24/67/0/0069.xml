THIS DOCiMhi,T IS THE PftuPLKTY Off HIS BHITANMIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).(JX- V 4** %.igECRETt WAK CABINET.G.T.6069.Some notes hastily put together on the possibilities opened up by an Armistice or a Peace with Turkey.1*    What possibilities will be open to us if the Turk s agrees to an Armistice including a free passage for ships of war an i troops through the Straits and into tho Black Sea ?(a) Tho Command of the Black Sea will pass into ourhands *(b) Operations against the Turks will cease in Europe,Palestine and Mesopotamia.(c) As a result of such cessation of hostilities thefollowing troops will be set free for other objectives(i)   General Milne&apos;s Force of 8 Divisions * &apos;(ii)   From Mesopotamia and Palestine a force of -2 British Cavalry Divisions 2 Indian       M &quot;1 British Infy. Division 7 Indian Infy.   Divisions.The total shown above amounts to -4 Cavalry Divisions 16 Infantry Divisions.It Is reasonable to hope th?*t with Command of the Black Sea we shall be able to put the Rumanian Army Into the Field once more.   This Army now stands at *2 Cavalry Divisions 4 Infantry Divisions.and this force is capable of expansion to about *2 Cavalry Divisions 10 Infantry Divisions.jig- (e)   We cannot expect much assistance from the Bulgers.(f)
(f)     Later on when we have really commenced operations in Austria, Hungary and Koumania we may hope for considerable assistance from the Poles, the Czechs, the Jugo-SelavB and the Roumanians *    It is not possible, at present, to translate this assistance Into terms of divisions but it Is reasonable to have considerable hopes for our future possibilities with these peopleS.    How do we stand if Turkey pives in?(a) A force of   -   4 Cavalry Divisions16 Infantry Divisionswill at once be set free.(b) A further force (Roumanian) of -2 Cavalry Divisions 4 to 10 Infantry Divisionswill presently be available.(e) Considerable assistance from Poles, Czechs,Jugo Sclavs and Roumanians.3.    In short we shall be in a position to reinforce our movement on the Danube and in Roumania by an Army of 26 to 32 Cavalry and Infantry Divisional and in addition we shall be helped by the people of Poland, Bohemia, Bosnia. Herzgovlnla and Roumania*   This is a formidable addition to our present threat to Austria-Hungary along the line of the Danube.4.    I am not able in the time at my disposal to work out the best disposition and distribution of these forces, but It is certain that the Port facilities at Salonika, Dedeagatch9 Constantinople, Varna, Constanze and the Danube are amply sufficient, as are the railways leading from these Ports to the Danube and to Hungary.5.    General Franchet d*Ksperey has now a force of 29 Divisions under his command of which 8 Divisions under General Wine are moving against   Turkey *    These 8 Divisions and IB to 24 more Divisions will be available to move against Austria-Hungary. &apos;
6.    It is certain that Austria-Hungary is quite unable to withstand such an attack at the same time as pressure, in no way diminished, Is exercised by the Italians both in Venetla and in Albania, and it is equally certain that the Germans are in no position to send assistance to their Ally, and therefore I have no hesitation in saying that an Italian movement on Laibach with a concentric Allied advance from the Danube and from Koumenia on Buda Pesth would be certain of achieving decisive results against the Hr-psburg Empire.7*    It Is not? easy to fix a date for the final overthrow of Austria-Hungary but from the day when we get command of the Black Sea to the day when we shall have detached or defeated the last of Germany&apos;s Allies will only be a matter of months and not many months, cither, and therefore our prospects in the Near East, should Turkey fall out, are so bright that we can well afford to be stiff in our dealings with Germany in the west.8.    In short, If we can get Turkey out of the war in the near future I see no reason why we should not Inflict a final crushing defeat on German Armies on German soil-(Id,)   H.w.21st Oct. 1918.
