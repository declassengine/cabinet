(Oft17th October, 1918.AN INQUIRY INTO THE LEANING AND EF^CT OP Til] DUKAND FOR &quot;PR&quot;TD0M OP TK3 S^AS&quot;,Adjniralty Memorandum for the War Cabinot.headingsTho proposal as stated by President Wilson on 8th January, 1918, is&quot;Absolute freedom of Navigation upon tho seas &quot;outside territorial waters alike in peace and in war, &quot;except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part &quot;by international action for the enf or cement of inter-&quot;national covenants&quot;,,the proposalIn this paper ft is examined&apos; undor the followingWhat is meant by &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot;? Oversea Com-innications in warThe German object in originally waking the proposal. International Control. Conclusions.(!) What is meant by &quot;Freedom of tho Seas&quot;.As far as the seas in time of peace are concerned, they have been free for centuries and their freedom had been maintained by the British Navy.     Nothing further need there-fore be said on this point.As regards tho seas in time of war, the proposal is presumably intended to apply solely to merchant vessels. It would clearly be fantastic to apply it to war vessels, since this would be tantamount to prohibiting all fighting between belligerents on the high sca3.     It is assumed, the2$-fore? that the President must have in mind freedom, both to belligerents and neutrals, to carry on overseas trade in spite of the existence of a state of war.Further, not only will neutrals bo free to carry contraband, but belligerents and neutrals alike will be free to carry foodstuffs and raw- materials of every description -and apparently also troops and munitions.In these circumstances there will be no right of capture ar detention at sea, except of warships by each other, and no object will bo served by the exercise of thB .\ .,1, right of search.If those assumptions are correct, blockade will be impossible, and it&apos;will&quot;bo possiblo for a belligerent to transport and maintain expeditions.overseas? subject only to interference in the territorial waters of his enemy.   Purely naval operations will bo hampered, in tho spheres in which they aro being conducted, by the presence of uncontrolled merchant shipping.If this is not a correct interpretation of the meaning of the phrase &quot;Freedom of tho Seas&quot;, it is necessary that the meaning shall be made clear before&quot; tho subject can be further discussed,(2) Oversea,.....
(2) Oversea Oonmmicatipns in war.It is a truism to say that unless communications can bo maintained warfare is Impossible.   Neither naval nor military forces can act unless they arc reasonably secure If a belligerent can cut tho linos for a sufficient length of time tho onomy is defeated, and in war it is always an obj ;-et-ofton tho principal objeot - to do this.   In tho present war wo have succeeded in cutting atost entirely Germany&apos;s oversea commanications; she is trying iby means of submarine warfare to cut ours.     The proposal to raako thoseas free in war time is in tho nature of a stop to prevent sea lines of eoirkiuiiication being cut.At first sight it may bo thought that as the sea is practically our only line of conmnication, while to any other nation it is but ono of their lines, we have more to gain by the proposal than anyone else.   It must be remembered, however, that the need for maintaining our oversea com-munications h s forcod us to provide for their protection, and that this has given us the power to interfere with tho corjiiunications of the enemy.     If, therefore, our lines arc secured by freedom of tho seas in war, so are those of anyone opposed to us.     Tho same linos are used by both, and the freeing of them from attack acts both ways.     It would prevent us from using our strogost weapon and place in tho hands of our onomy a power which he does not possess.     The value of military power., both for attack and defence, would bo enhanced, and its radius of action increased, while tho value of naval power for attack and dofenco and its radius of action would bo c orr o spondingly diininishod.Further the establishment of the principle of &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; in time of War would act as an incentive rather than a deterrent of war.  -*(3) The Gorman object, in orginally making tho proposal.From the foregoing tho German object in making tho proposal is evident,     Germany, a strong land Power making a bid for world supremacy, found her efforts baffled by the sea-power of the British Empire,   She was suffering from shortage of food, immitions, and raw materials, and saw her enemy supplied with all of thorn by soa.   Odd she carry an army safely oversea she could hopd to destroy us; could she use her merchant ships or import in neutral bottoms her shortage would disappear.   These objects wore doniod to her by our sea-powor.   If the use of soa-powor could be thus restricted, she could achieve hor desires.     The demand.for &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; was therefore revived and put forward as an aim for which all nations should strive, in the interests of the world&apos;s peace.   G-orjiany, whose industry is war, saw a military advantage in the proposal.   Ncpoloon constantly raised a similar cry.(4) International control.It is observed that President Wilson contemplates international action in emergency, and it is said that the activities of tho various countries would henceforth bocontrolled by
by a League of Nations, which woulfl keop the peace by exercising a dominating influence over any recalcitrant raombor and determine the extent of tho force which each member of tho League would require to maintain in order to provide by Joint force for this purpose.   Tho    conditions of the British Empire, however, are so unique and its dependence on feea communications so vital, that it is impossible even to contemplate conraitting its whole destinies at soa to iany League or combination of nations.The British idea of the freedom of the soas is free and unfettered access in time of poaoe to all the seas by all who wish to cross them &quot;upon thoir lawful occasions&quot;, in timo of war this privilege must be fought for by belligerent navios, causing as little inconvenience as possible to noutrals, but maintaining the rights of capture bf belligerent merchant ships and of searching neutral merchant ships in order to verify their nationality and prevent their aiding a belligerent.(5) Conclusions.(i) Aoceptanco of the proposal would result in making sea-power af little value to a nation dependent upon it for existence whilst providing a military Power with froe linos of oversea communication.ill) The right to decide for ourselves questions which-c^rnoern such vital interests, could not be surrendered to any League or combination of nations for by as-senting to -tho proposal we should give up by a stroke of the pen tho sea^power wo have for centuries maintainod and have never yet nisused.    On this basis the British Empire has been founded, and on no other oan it be upheld.17,10.18.(Sgd) EJ.IMSS,
