-    ,, % (This Documflnt -.. the Prof :rty. LWio &quot;i nil&apos;        &apos;    . :&apos; &quot;. iji.)filfYient.)FUNCTION OP THE MINISTRY OF INFORMATION ON THE CESSATION OP HOSTILITIES.Memorandum to the War Cabinet by the Minister ofInformation.The oesoation of hostilities must olearly produce a new situation as far as the Ministry of Information is concerned.   It would be advisable to keep the Ministry inexistence during the interval between the cessation of-hostilities and tho actual signature of peace, for public opinion throughout the world will be a vital objeot to His Majesty&apos;s Government during tho intervening period.The position of the British Government at the Peace Conference will have to be explained to the world day by day if the solidarity of allied opinion is to be main-tained.   In a lesser degree it will be necessary to dwell on the effortb Great Britain has mado in the war.   But an organisation intended for War Propaganda will have to undor-go considerable modification if it is to be adapted to the needs of the Empire during the Peace Conference.The authority of the War Cabinet is therefore sought to ensure (l) that the Ministry of Information shall be continued until the Signature of the roace Troaty; (2) that the Ministry shall be allowed to make such alterations in its methods and organisation, as will enable it to meet the new condition.These changes may be indicated briefly.The War effort of Great Britain will no longer be the principal topic of the Ministry of Information.   It will only be necessary ,to insist on.it on occasions., or in particular localities., such as in the ISaat where prestigo is a primary consideration.
It will he no lor^ai^r^^saajry- to insist on -certain,,, specific territorial ohangos, such as the r^trtHmaalon of Alsaco-Lorraine to Franoe, or the. restoration and indemnlf-ication of Belgium.   In a word, the main war aims of the Allies will bo realised and need no longer be preached.The functions of the Ministry will be to secure public support in all foreign countries for the view of the Imperial Government and to give the reason why tho Imperial Government is justified in adopting a certain attitude towards the problems before the Conference.     In this way Allied opinion will be kept solid and   Neutral opinion friendly.The necessary changes in machinery and method must be made in advance and it is for this reason that the sanction of the War Cabinet is required before our Staff and Agents are warned of the impending change.In the first place, the Ministry will have to be ready to alter, not only the objects, but the type of its propaganda material.   Publications which take a long time to prepare will be useless.   Cables, wireless and artioles will&apos; become the only essential instruments for defining the position of His Majesty&apos;s   Government at the Peace Conference.   Both the alteration in policy and in method will require time and should be put in hand at once.In the second place, the Ministry can only justify its existence during tho period In which the terms of the Peace Treaty are being settled by maintaining the closest possible touch with the British representatives at the Conference. Wherever it may be held, there will all the journalists of the World gather together.   On the information v/hlch they obtain^ from the peace-delegates and their associates will depend the impression produced in every country as to the course of the negotiations - an impression which will react on the negot-iations themselves.   The function of the Ministry is here quite clear, and it would seem desirable that the Ministry should transfer some part of its working staff (whether openly or secretly) attached to the British Delegation to the scene of the Conference.
I should be glad if the War Cabinet would give me -ran instruction to carry out the policy suggested in this Minute.October 16, 191F, BSAVERBROOK.9 K
