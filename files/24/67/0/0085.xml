\1s^S-^e/Xx -&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;-jJI^MEMQBANDUM BY THE MINISTER OP LABOUR OB /      ,    ANTICIPATED STRIKE OP THS! ELECTRICALTBADBS UNION IN ;BIEOEUO POWER UTOJ&amp;TAnBfOS.)0I have to submit to the War Cabinet tho possibility of a serious labour trouble, on which I desire their directions!.-Throughout the war the.Electrical Trades Union has given great trouble both to the Ministry of labour and the Ministry of Munitions and from time to time has threatened to stop the electrical power undertakings in various parts of the country.    The present Secretary of the London district - Mr. Webb - is extremely anxious to incor-porate in his union ail persons connected with electrical power undertakings, and his particular attack is directed against a recently formed union called the Electrical Power Kngineera&apos;Associa-*ion which apparently comprises some of the technical staff at electricity undertakings.    It has been brought to my notice that the Bleotrical Trades Union is threatening that unless all the members of this Association join the Electrical Trades Union, they will make it impossible for the members of the Association to earn a living in the electrical industry and it is quite likely that they may enforce this claim for compulsory membership of the Electrical Trades Union which they have submitted to arbitration by a sudden withdrawal of their labour fpom the power undertakings.   It is improbable that the Committee on Production could decide a claim of this nature.I understand that G.H.Q.(Home Forces) acting in conjunction with, the Commission of tho Metropolitan Police have made arrange-ments for tho immediate supply of auxiliary labour to most of the electrical power undertakings within the London area, but that they have not yet been able to obtain information as to the number of electricians who will be required in the London boroughs.I suggest therefore that the Ministry of Munitions, who will be concerned with possible damag? to the munition factories, the Ministry of Food, whose cold storage installations would be affected, the VTar Office whose hospitals would also be affected and the Local Government Board should in collaboration with G.H.Q. (Home Forces) obtain confidentially from the boroughs the numbers of men who will be required to keep the undertakings running.   This enquiry should be treated as a matter of urgency as this stoppage if it is to take place at all will undoubtedly be sudden.Further, I ask for sanction that if such a stoppage takes place the operation of the Military Service Acts should be immediately applied to suoh men in the union who have stopped as are liable. * to Military Service.I propose also to submit the facts to the Director of Public Prosecutions so that if a strike takos plaoe immediate action can be taken against the instigators.    Further, a statement will be prepared for communication to the Press if necessary.I ask tho sanction of the War Cabinet to the adoption of these proposals should oircumstances admit it.In the meantime I am arranging for the General Secretary of the Union to be approached to see whether sober counsels may not prevail.
