Iji This Document is the Property ofbs/1606. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.             of1.10.1918.             1% &quot;                                     0I * (\    P        0     t&quot;\^        &apos; - Ootober 11-10,1918I3--4  here has been a rapid rise during the weekof the mark exchanges in. Holland, switnorland and Scandinavia, due, presumably, to anticipations of an early peace.    The exchange on Amsterdam rose from 34*70 on October 9th to 39.76 on October 14th.    2ho exchange on Zurich rose in the same period from 70.715 to 79.50,     he Scandinavian exchange rose from 52.25 to 61.50 (Christlanla);   from 67.00 to 60.00 (Copenhagen); and from 47.76 to 69.60 (Stockholm)*    it Stockholm there has since been a sharp relapse, in consequence of President Wilson1s reply, to 51 (Qot.16).12, HOHWAY.     Under the A&amp;eriean-Horwegl an Agreement the Associated Governments may not discriminate against Uorweglan firms on the sole ground that they traded with the enemy before the Agreement was signed, -and it is therefore necessary to whitewash certain firme and admit them to the privileges of the Agreement.     he Horwegian Government have proved very aocomodating in their interpretation of the Agreement and have shewn little desire to support Norwegian firms which are blacklisted or notified as under suspicion by the Allies.    They have agreed that firms whitewashed under the Agreement shall bo required to sign an undertaking to abandon all trade, direct or indirect, with the $ enemy so long as the war continues.    She firms concerned will be at liberty to denounce this undertaking at three months notice if they so desire;   but in thie event the Associated Governments will be free to restore them to the Blacklist.3. IIglff.BMJ)B*    The fatherlands Government are giving full powers to the Dutch delegates who are coming to Xondon to negotiate a
general Agreement *    si. Vuletar the representative of tho H,0,T. will be one of the delegates, and will have full powers.     On October 10th Sir. V/. Townley informed tho Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs that H.M. Government oeuld not consent to any weakening of the oon-trol of the Trust over Dutch Imports;   that the new Agreement should be based upon the existing guarantees and organisation, of the Trust; and that a revised consolidating Agreement between tho5?ruet and the Allied Governmenta should form part of the proposed general settle-mont.    The United States Government have agreed that those negotia-tions shall take place in London end are Bending J$r. Sheldon &apos;the necessary instructions,,    3?hey stipulate, however, that the full text of the iigreement shall be submitted to Washington for consideration before tho Agreement is signed.(The United states State Department havo decided to publish a statement justifying their past and present attitude towards the Netherlands government and offering to put at the disposal of Holland 100,000 tone of American coal monthly at tho United States poThe Go mane have agreed to give safe-conducts to 60*000 tons of Dutch shipping to bring over grain from the Argentine.,    This understanding does not apparently form part of any general Agreement with the Gero.au Authorities.     It is understood that the negotiations between Holland and Germany have been postponed until negotiations have boon opened with the AIIies*The German Government have announced that no-further supplies of butter can for the moment be officially obtained from Holland., Private consumers in Genaany may o stain butter from Holland if they e and such supplies will not be aubject to the restrictions which apply to official imports of food.We understood from the Dutch Government that, in deference to their objections, Germany had agreed to send no further consignments of railway material to Belgium over the Limburg Hallway such material being regarded by the Dutch Government as material of war.
Further consignments, however, have recently boon noted and we have again protested.    The Dutch Mnistor for Foreign-Affaire admits that railway inatorialo are ctill passing.    He explains that the Juutoh Oovorhaant in their rooent a:-our one as in-tended to refer only to narrow gauge railway material.     All other -railway material is apparently allowed a free passage.Imim FIMAliCE m SOUTH AMKHICA.      The Allied Banks in Buenoe Aires have deoided to scrutinise clearing house operations in order to discover whether lieutral firms are dealing with Gorman banks, firms dealing with Gorman Banks will be refused facilities by the -Allied Banks unices they break the connection.    fX&apos;he Allied Banks in Chile are also prepared to take action.     hey have offered to refuse ohcguea on German Banks if they are invited to do so.    This proposal is warmly approved by the British Chamber of Gomaoroe at Valparaiso,    The Banco Piehineha, the only b?nk in Quito (Ecuador), has not only undertaken to transact no further business with Gorman firms, but has furnished the Allied authorities with full particulars of tho Gorman holdings in the Bank raid warned their shareholders to abstain from disposing of their chares to enemy purchasers.BOLIVIA.     The Germans in Bolivia, who still have great influence, have contrived that a Bill should bo introduced In the Bolivian Congress to the effect that persons who hold commercial positions shall not bo recognised as Consular Officers.    This measure serious-ly threatens cur administration of the British Statutory List in Bolivia as moat of the officers on whom we rely hold business appointments.    A Bill has also been introduced prohibiting foreign merchants from introducing into their sale-contracta the condition that goods may not be transferred to the enemy. ROE08)53) IliTERgATXOML PRIZaCOClff. A Keutral Conference was lately held at Copenhagen to discuss the possibility of setting up an
0 0Minternational priZocourt to review decisions of tho belligerent prizeoourte taken during the war.    Ho orfioial account has been iuouau of the proceedings of this Conference, as the Dutoh delegates who were unable to attend have not yet considered the resolutions. Tho Conference apparently decided than an international Supreme Court of Appeal should be set up and that application should be made to the belligerent countries for a revieion of unjust decisions and for compensation in oases of hardship.$7. .ty;/rX2&amp;f&amp;AflD.    2he Federal Government have set up a Ministry of flood which will take over duties hitherto performed by the various Swiss Departments.     2he new Ministry will control all measures touching food supplies, the acquisition of fodder  tuffs, and distri-bntion of raw materials and manufactured goods, the fixing of prices end the regulations against profiteering.    rfho new Ministry will be placed under a Director nominated by the Federal Council, who will attend the meetings of the Federal Council whenever questions are dlsoussad affecting his Department.g8* SKMJJ BUmaiMI BJuQCiai)!.
