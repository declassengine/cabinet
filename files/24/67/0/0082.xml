This Document is the Property of 8 U 9 A R.On the 17th instant I sa,w Mr. Sandbach Parker of the British Empire Producers 0organization and Mr, William Martineau who came with him to represent the British sugar refiners.   Their object was to urge the need for an early declaration of our policy in regard to Colonial sugar after the war.    Something must be done to replace the sugar we used to get from enemy countries, and we ought to be making arrangements to extend the cultiva-tion of cane in our tropical Colonies,    But previous experience has made capital shy of Colonial sugar-growing and it is impossible to get the money for increased cultivation or improved machinery without some assurance for the future.     They contend that, with a preference of one third of the existing duty, the Empire could become self-supporting in ten years.    However that may be, I have little doubt that there is room for great development, but that there will be no development of any kind, but rather a falling off, unless the producers get some assurance of a preference in our market.On behalf of the refiners it was represented to me that the British refiners can deal normally with 750s000 tons and at top pressure with 1,000,000 tone of the 1j750,000 tons&apos; of refined sugar that the United Kingdom requires annually.    They are anxious to put up machinery to deal with the whole quantity.   But there is a movement on the part of American refiners in conjunction with Cuban growers to capture the British market after the war, and without a promise of preference the British refiners cannot get the capital wanted and would not borrow it if they could.They(j iJ x
Thoy represented with some justice that we should be little better off after the war if we only exchange dependence on Germany and Austria for dependence on the United States and Ouba.    I understand that an alliance between the American refiners and the Cuban producers wj,th the object of capturing European markets is being actively discussed and that it will be too late to meet this competition if arrangements are not made soon on our side.    They represented to me that these arrangements would be made by the growers and the refiners without delay once they had a definite assurance of a preference for British sugar, but that nothing can be done until the Government formally announces its policy.      In the circumstances it seems to me essential I   that this should be done at an early date.*IJLL.23.10.1918.COLONIAL OFFICE.
