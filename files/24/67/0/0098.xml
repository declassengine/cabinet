27/CJI./6973 Ac ,       , :,: ,nt )War OabirieYI1/Recall of Coal Miners,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for v&quot;ar^  /    JoolJ     x am extremely anxious to oarry out the decision ?f the^M)inet (w0Coft86 (12)) about recalling coal-miners from&apos; themorc scrupulously anxious beoause I so entirely!:L-disagree with it,   But I really must ask for further guidanoe in the matter*   As the order stands( I do not in thelte&amp;^t know what it means or what I am expeoted to do,,The last Cabinet Minute on the subject is as follows:-&quot;The Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the   &apos; Admiralty, and the Air Minister should transfer to the Reserve their respective quota of miners up to the numbers and of the medical categories asked for by the Coal Controller, subject to the conditions that men from the Army will be taken, in the first instance, from divisions which have been withdrawn from, active offensive operations, and which will not be employed again this year for active operations, and that the Admiralty should be authorised tu withhold the release of stokers serving in the Royal llavy.&quot;This present!! a number of conundrums.1..    &quot;Up to the numbers and of the medical sategories asked for &quot;by the Coal Controller.&quot;liilhat is the number?   It origirfally was 25,000, but this was subsequently raised to 60,000.   At the date of the last discussion in the Cabinet we had already returned from the Army nearly 26,000 men, and the number has now risen to 27.00^, of whom 5,300 were Ai. and Bi. and 21,500 Biis   But the Coal Controller then declared that, aB these were men of low physical,categories, they ought to be reckoned as no more than equal to 17,000 A,^r Bi men, these latter being the only class of men that he really wanted..   I think this assumption, that every man of a oategory below Bi, who is returned from the Army, is only to count as three^fifths of a man, is extremely arbitrary, especially having regard to the fact that of the low category men already returned, 74$ are actually working on the face.   It may well be that a man who, o*-ing to some physical ,,. defect specially unfitting him for field work, belongs from the military point of view to a low oategory, is nevertheless not by any means unfitted for hard physical work of a different kind - which does not, for instance, involve marching,But be that as it may, I mast, for my own guidance, have a clear ruling, whether the Cabinet&apos; accepts the two-thirds of a man principle&apos;or not?   If it does, then it is evident, that since the 27,000 already returned are only three-fifths of a man caoh, and therefore only number 18,000, 32,000 men are still owed to the mineB,But here another question arises\   Is the demand a demand for 32,000 A. or B$,. Hien simplicjter t or is it-for% he equivalent of 32,000 A. or BiB. men?   In other words, oan it o&quot;nly   &quot;satisfied by the return of .32,000 aotual A, and Bi, men, or could it be satisifed by the return of, Bay 10,000 A. and Bif, men and 24,000- men of lower categories, these being, on the two-thirds of a man basis, the equivalent of a further 16,000 A. and Bi. men?   (Of course the particular figures are only an illustration:   the point is, whether men of lower categories are substitutable, in the proportion of 5 to 3, for A. and Bi,men.)
men),24th October, 191B,As far as I understand the matter, the Coal Controller contends for the former view.   He wants to have only A. and Bi. men.   But I am not sure whether this is the view of the Cabinet. It is fair to warn the Cabinetj before it finally decides the point, that to call out 32,000 A, and Bi, men will be infinitely more disastrous to the Amy than to call out the equivalent of 32,000 Ac and Bi, nen,.   For, while a certain number of A, and Bi, men can no doubt be obtained without serious inconvenience, it is totally impossible to get as many as 32,000 without completely dislocating some of the best units in the Army,   And as the Army, which has had 800,000 casualties already this year, and is still fighting hard while recruiting has almost some,to an end, will in any oase fall to not much more than half its 1918 strength in 1919, this is a grave consideration, Whether the difference to the mines between a smaller number of A, and Bi. men and a larger number of men of lower categories is equally great. I cannot say,     Judging from the readiness with which men of the lower categories have been absorbed, I 3hould hardly think so.   But I do not propose to argue the matter further,   I   only want to know what the decision of the Cabinet is.2,     &quot;The Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Air Minister shall transfer to the Reserve their respective quota oXminers-   &apos; &apos;What is the quota?   What proportion is it expected that the Army, the l*avy, and the Air Force should furnish respectively?   Will the Cabinet, please, lay down the proportions, as1-other wise it is perfectly certain thtt the I-avy and the Air Force will contribute nothing at all, and that the whole sacrifice will be exacted, as always, from the Army.I presume this will be done by the Kinistry of lational Service.3,     &quot;Hen from the Army will be tfcken, in the firBt instance, from divisions which have been withdrawn from active offensive operations, and which will not be employed again thin year for active operations,&quot;With a view to carrying out this decision we have communicated with G,H,Q,, in France, in order that miners may &quot;be withdrawn from divisions answering tfrt above description,   I have not yet heard the result, but I am bound to warn the Cabinet that, for the immediate future, it is likely to be very small, for, as I understand, it is the intention of the Allied High Command that, while the enemy continues to give ground, we shall press him for all we are worth as long as the weather permits. Under these circumstances, while some divisions are alvays in reserve, there are few, if any, divisions of which it can yet be said that they &quot;will not be employed again this y^ar for active operations,&quot;     If there are at the present moment no such divisions, or only very few, and if those few only contain an inconsiderable number of miners, what is to be done?t*&quot;y own reading of the Cabinet decision is that we. must wait, and not break up or materially weaken any unit until it is certain that it will not be required again for active operations this year,   &quot;But 1 want *&amp;o be sure that I rirhtly interpret the vishes of the Cabinet in this reppectt
