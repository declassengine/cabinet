^EOtfft DotjiMeiWis the Property.of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]CONFIDENTIAL. [October 15, 1918.]Political Intelligence Department. Foreign Office.Japan /002.(03/. MEMORANDUMonTHE JAPANESE ROLE IN THE INTERVENTION IN SIBERIA.THE Japanese attitude in Siberia has not always been transparent, and there has been conflict from time to time between the utterances of Tokyo and the activities of the Japanese agents in Siberia. The general scope of Allied intervention, so far as that principle was discussed by the Western Powers and America, was to be the prevention of the Eastward extension of German domination and control, or, more particularly, to prevent Germany from obtaining control of the resources of Western Siberia for her use in the war ; to aid in the restoration of Russia, compelling Germany at the same time to keep troops in Russia; and to obtain the support and good-will of the Siberian peasants by letting them have at cost price various manufactured articles which they were unable to obtain otherwise for themselves. It is doubtful, however, whether the Japanese considered the question of intervention in the same frank and disinterested manner.Long previous to the decision of the 3rd August for active intervention in connection with the Czecho-Slovak denouement (cf. P.I.D. Memorandum Russia/014), Mr. Balfour telegraphed (4th February) to Sir J. Jordan that &quot; the support of any purely Russian movement in Siberia, prepared to act energetically, was essential. Semenov apparently was prepared to so act; and, therefore, his adherents should be informed through tho Consular Office at Harbin that we were prepared to support his movement with money, arms, and ammunition.&quot; From the beginning, however, the Japanese showed a remarkable interest in Semenov&apos;s organisation, supplying him with arms and ammu-nition. It also appears that the local Japanese representatives were anxious that their offers of assistance to Semenov should be kept secret.On the 28th February the Japanese consul at Harbin informed His Majesty&apos;s consul that the arms required by Semenov would be shortly supplied, and that Japan was ready to send an expedition to assist him, but would not attempt to occupy Siberia. The continued encouragement and instigation of Semenov by the Japanese at a later period, when the other Powers were endeavouring to restrain him, the constant occasions of misunderstanding between him and Kolchak, due, in the opinion of the latter, to definite Japanese attempts to promote disunion, with a view to facilitating&apos; their own ultimate supremacy, are further instances of ambiguities of policy that seem to require explanation.According to the report of the local consul, Admiral Kato took the decision to land a Japanese force at Vladivostok on the 5th April, without consulting his foreign colleagues. They were only told about the matter the night before, and the Japanese force was landed at dawn the next morning, accompanied, however, by a British force, since Captain Payne, of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; &quot; at once offered to act on the same lines.&quot; According to the same report, the Japanese were generally believed to have instigated a rising against the Soviet in Blagovyestchensk, in February, which ended unsuccessfully.Partly on political grounds, and possibly for economic reasons, Japan seems to have been averse to a joint military operation in Siberia on the part of the Allies. At an early stage she wanted to know whether, if after making an agreement with the Allied Powers she should decide to take certain military measures and find herself obliged to have recourse to the moral and material support of the United States, she could count on the latter.   Later her attitude was modified :&quot; In view of the fact that Japan&apos;s motives in intervening are solely her desire to discharge her duty as a member of the Grand Alliance, the Japanese General Staff are willing to waive their objection to the participation of the Allied forces in the Japanese military operation, should any of the Allies so desire, provided that such a step would prove effective in removing the opposition of the United States.&quot;[367-45]
Iri the early stages she plainly wished to bargain, but at first it was difficult to know what the Japanese intentions were. Whenever these have been expressed, they do not appear to have anticipated action further west than Chita or Verkhni-Udinsk, or possibly Irkutsk. General Saito, for example, expressed the opinion that the Japanese advance should not go beyond Chita, and be limited to five divisions.Meanwhile the desire was growing amongst the European Allied Powers for intervention, in which Japan should provide most of the military strength and the supreme command, but in which the other Allies should effectively participate. The Japanese had apparently at first thought only of intervention &quot; to prevent German penetration to the Pacific coast.&quot; &quot; To&apos; send troops as far as Tchelyabinsk to divert Germans from the Western front&quot; was &quot;an entirely new idea.&quot; Intervention in general assistance of the Allied cause had not been fully considered by them. Mean-while they offered one thousand volunteers to Semenov with the idea of bringing about Japanese intervention. It is also worthy of remark in this connection, that in some cases the resolutions passed at the public meetings in towns in Eastern Siberia calling for Allied intervention stated that the Japanese alone would be invited if the Allies did not respond.Japanese sensitivity was also visible in connection with the suggestion that the Americans should take control of the Eastern Siberian Railway for the purposes of the campaign. It came out more strongly in their insistence that the complete approval of the United States Government was necessary before they could agree to joint action with the Allies. Their general attitude to the political Russian situation may be gathered from the statement that they could not recognise the Siberian Provisional Government and would only support General Horvat, in conjunction with the Allies. On the other hand, in the matter of arresting the Bolshevik agitation leaders in Vladivostok, &quot; the Japanese Government does not seem in a hurry to oblige us.&quot;On the 16th July the Japanese reported that they had some days previously received a proposal from the United States Government that each of these Governments should despatch about 7,000 men to replace the Czechs, who were moving westward. This proposal was viewed in a favourable light by the Japanese Cabinet and formally adopted on the 20th July.At this time the attitude of the United States Government was as follows : The President desired to send an economic mission through Vladivostok to supply material assistance, but feared that military intervention, &quot;even supposing it should be efficacious in its avowed object of delivering an attack upon Germany from the East, would be merely a method of making use of Russia, not a method of serving her.&quot; To this the reply was made that if Russia was to be herself again she must be free from an alien domination, the whole object of which was to shatter her political fabric and exploit her material resources. The President also feared, with justice, that intervention, being primarily conducted by the military, would inevitably foster reaction. The desire of the Allies &quot; to keop free frorn the party disputes by which Russia is torn,&quot; and leave her &quot; free to choose her own form of Government and to pursue in her own way her own lines of self-development,&quot; after cleansing her from German influences supported by German soldiers, has met with unlooked-for difficulties which have called forth a question as to the practicability of the policy from His Majesty&apos;s representative in Archangel.On the 3rd August the decision was taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government in concert with the Allies to extend military help to the Czecho-Slovaks in Russia. The Allied forces agreed upon were : &quot; America, roughly, 7,000; Great Britain, 3,500; Italy and France, 300; making 12,800 [sic]&quot; in all. Japan to send 12,500 and have the supreme command of the total force of 25,000. The United States Government was ready to entertain the idea of subsequent reinforcements if necessary. Japan agreed to send 12,000 men to Vladivostok, stating that she would consult the United States Government with regard to moving them outside that town, and disposing of extra bodies of troops at various places along the railway. She reserved, however, to herself tjie right &quot; to take immediate action should a sudden grave ernergency call for such -a course/&apos;In connection with the landing of the first detachments of Japanese troops, the Japanese Government issued a proclamation in which they stated that they &quot;remain in their constant desire to promote relations of enduring friendship with Russia, and they reaffirm their avowed policy of respecting the territorial integrity of Russia, and of abstaining from all interference in her internal politics. They further declare that upon tlnj realisation of the objects above indicated &quot; (i.e., relieving the pressure upon the Ozecho-Slovak forces and preventing the extension of the activities of the Central
0 DPowers to the Russian Far Eastern possessions) &quot; they will immediately withdraw all Japanese troops from the Russian territories and will leave wholly unimpaired the sovereignty of Russia in all its phases, whether political or military.&quot;In connection with the plans for intervention, a scheme of economic relief was also worked out for administration under the Allied Governments. The two principles underlying the supply of goods to Siberian consumers were laid down as follows : first, that the whole transaction should be as far possible self-supporting and not eleemosynary, and so prevent abuses like the exploitation of the consumers by Chinese and other middlemen ; and that the element of. profit-making should be excluded from the supply and distribution of goods sent for the purposes of relief, so as to make it clear that the object was to benefit the local population and to avoid any suspicion that the Allies were aiming at exploitation of the economic necessities of Siberia for private gain. The Japanese, however, are reported as &quot; using every effort to secure valuable rights and concessions of all kinds.&quot; In close connection with the above may be taken the following comment upon recent -Japanese activity in China by Sir J. Jordan : &quot; I have endeavoured in a number of recent despatches to convey some idea of the policy and methods of exploitation which have been pursued by Japan in this country during the past year. Misgivings of Japanese Government as to wisdom of that policy synchronise as closely with change of allied fortunes of war as with change in Japanese Cabinet. When result of that policy comes to be reviewed by Allied Governments it will be impossible for Japanese Government to evade responsibility for deliberate adoption of a policy which has resulted in establishment of a preferential status for Japanese in communications, industries, and commerce of this country, and in continuation of a disastrous civil war, Japans action in China will be found strongly at variance with the aims and principles proclaimed by the Allies.&quot;In opposition to suggestions that the,scale of intervention should be enlarged, the United States Government has held steadily to its point of view that &quot; it should be left to a later time and circumstances not yet developed to consider radical alteration of the whole scale and character of action in Siberia.&quot; The President has stated &quot; unalterable facts which must of necessity limit military action and supplying of armies in Siberia.&quot; None the less the Japanese were moving troops from Lower Manchuria towards &quot;Manchuria&quot; station on the 13th August, although not intending to send them across the border, and an &quot; intimation &quot; was given to the United States Government that a third Japanese division was being mobilised and would probably start for the Chita front on the 4th September. &quot; Meanwhile the Japanese troops are not ingratiating themselves with the natives, owing to their high-handed behaviour,&quot; and General Gaida, Commander-in-chief of the Czecho-Slovak forces, &quot;only voices opinions freely expressed here when stating the object of the Japanese is to weaken Russia.&quot;
