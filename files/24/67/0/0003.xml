This document Is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government)w -A R &apos;   CAD I V. g T, .SECRET. .T.6003.TI3K DISPOSAL OP GOVERNMENT STORBS. (Memorandum by the Uinistcr of Reconstruction) *I have road the Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of October 14th, and In connection therewith would dran attention to the Resolution adopted by the Surplus Government Property Advisory Council at its meeting on October 10th, which has been forwarded to the War Cabinet.I am in entire agreement with the Resolution of the Advisory Council.The fact that the Cabinet decision has not been given effect to and that vhave been delayed and hold up by fruitless discussions is due principally to the objection of some of tho Departments to tho method of tho working which would require to be adopted and which, I believe, would have been capable of satisfactory adjustment on the lines indicated in the Resolution of the Advisory Council, if any serious attempt had been made to carry out the decision of the War Cabinet.As the Chancellor points out in his Memorandum, in tho absence of any other effective proposal, it was suggested that I should take the responsibility for both bodies.    My objection was not due to the fact that I was not satisfied as to the proprtty.    It solely arises from the fact that I have no powers under the Act of Parliament constituting this Ministry to discharge ,such responsibilities *  . I. do not regard such as the proper business of this Ministry, but I would have been &quot;  willing to accept the responsibility, had I the ncoossary legal powers.
---------------........................-.....................,-,...............................------...........^...,-..^^SS^i17I am firmly convinced that if we arc to avoid waste and- -serious- jseandals, we should constitute a strong and independent authority to deal with the whole mattert delegating such responsibility with regard to details of sales to the Departments as may be found to be expedient,This matter has been the subject of prolonged and detailed consideration for eighteen months and of more than one Cabinet decision and what is required is that that decision, in some appropriate form, should bo given effect to.     I do not believe that it oan adequately be given effect to without legislation, but.I should have thought it would not have been a&apos; difficult matter to constitute a Statutory Commission or some similar authority to deal with the whole matter on the lines indicated by the Advisory Council, and it would seem to me that the proper body for the iStatutory Commission to report to on this very important matter would be tho Treasury itself.The anxiety of us all is to avoid wastes and scandals and tc secure that any schemes adopted by the Government for&apos; public benefit should havo made available for them, on suitable terms,&apos;the property that has been acquired by the Ration for&apos; the purposes of the 7:ar, appropriate to the ends in view,It was, for these reasons, that the proposals &quot;of the Office and the Ministry of Munitions, under both MrvMontagu and myself, were ultimately formulated -I may say, with the concurrence of the -Departments concerned.,-   These were ratified by the Cabinet.I believe that the legislation involved would be of a very simple characterand -the analogy of the Duke Commission is a case in point,(Sgd.)
