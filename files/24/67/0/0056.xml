Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.mUi I ibo^h )cJ8estoration of Pre-War Practices Bill.1 have not seen the Bill nor the Memorandum referred to in paragraph 17 of the Minutes of the War Cabinet held on Wednesday, 16th October, but 1 have read the lVtinutes, and, as an ex-Minister of Munitions, I am bound to urge, with the greatest deference to Mr. Churchill, my profound difference from the views he there expressed.I have a vivid recollection of the proceedings at the Treasury when I was present at the negotiations between the present Prime Minister and Labour which led to the Munitions of War Act, the proceedings which were the whole foundation of our output of munitions, and I say, with the greatest possible conviction, that we have no other course but to redeem our pledges unless those to whom they were made release us from them. I am quite satisfied that without those pledges the Prime Minister would never have get the munitions which he succeeded in getting, or the labour which was at his disposal throughout, and I cannot therefore but view, with febe same- alarm the statement of the Minister of Munitions that he has explained &quot;to bodies of workmen that it was impossible to redeem the Governments pledges.&quot; The Minister of Munitions may be quite right in saying that the labour conditions which we are pledged to restore are absurd and vicious; he may be quite right in saying that the Bill (which I have not seen) will entrench a number of small and close corporations in restraint of trade; but if this Bill carries out the solemn pledges made over and over again and accepted over and over again by the Government, then it seems to me that these arguments should be addressed to those to whom the pledges were made, and that they should be asked to substitute for those conditions new and better ones. The pledges made are as solemn as, if not more solemn than, any International Treaty, and I do not think we could go into the negotiations which the Minister of Munitions suggests with clean hands unless we say that we have no choice but to restore the old conditions in fulfilment of our pledges unless those to whom they were made are willing to confer with us with a view to substituting better conditions for the old conditions. I agree entirely with the Minister of Labour when he savs that without a Bill there could be no negotiations with the Trade Unions.Perhaps I may add that this matter interests me not only as one who was in 1915 and again in 1916 concerned with these subjects, but also in my present Office. It is lamentable, but it is true, that nothing is so difficult as to persuade Indians to-day to believe that we intend to carry out pledges made to them. Our enemies in that country use every opportunity of pointing out to Indians reasons for not trusting our word. I am certain that if wo refuse to carry out pledges to Labour from which we have not been released, there will be many opportunities in the Labour troubles which will ensue for those opposed to British government in India to point out to the Indians that if we do not keep our faith to our own people, we cannot be expected to keep our faith with them.E. S. M.18th October 1918.10  ss7     15  10/18
