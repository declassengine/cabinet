The War Cabinet decided when the matter was before them that&apos; the information obtained by the Council should also be made available to the Dominions as they were understood to be desirous of being permitted to acquire if they wished to do so property accumulated by the Government during the War,The Surplus Government Property Disposal Board has its origin in a Minute of the War Cabinet of 7th June, 1917, (WoC157 para., 14.) when it was decided upon a suggestion emanating from the War Office which was submitted by Mrt Montagu that there should be set up a single authority to dispose of all Government Stores at the end of the Y/ar; the Stores Department of the Ministry of Munitions to form the nucleus of such an authority to which should be added represen-tatives of the War Office and the Admiralty; recommendations as to the composition of and reference to this authority to be made by Conferences between representatives of the Departments concerned and the Reconstruction Committee..        tThe powers of duties of these two bodies and their relations to each other have presented very difficult problems and given rise to much controversy, and though the discussions, have been now prolonged for a period of nearly twelve months no settlement has been reached.   The Advisory Council and the War Office have favoured arrangements under which Departments would be relieved of all responsibility in connection with their surplus property which they would merely report to the Advisory Council which would decide whether it should be disposed of through the Disposal Board or otherwisea   The Department would then hand over the property to the Disposal Board or to any one else who might be authorised to receive it by the Advisory Council and as a Department take no further interest in the matter-     The Disposal Board would have-a full staff of experts to&apos;deal with the property handed over and make arrangements for sale.S E &apos;C RE ToWARCABINS T,The
The Treasury   Ad-.irp.lty and Office of Works on the. other hand have taken the&apos;view that tho Advisory Council should he merely a Clearing House for information and a Committee to advise theDepartments and the Qoy^rnnent generally as to the disposal of surplus property and that tho Tisposal Board, should ho an Interdepartmental and       . Consultative Committee to co-ordinate the activities oi tne, various Departments- and to secure that sales -by different&apos; Department0 of similar kinds of property&apos; are not made in competition with each other.Under this arrangement the executive work in connection with the actual disposal of the property would in the main be carried out by the Departments themselves though it would he possible and probably desirable for the Departments to set up an Interdepartmental Executive Committee Or separate Committoea for different classes of goods to carry out on their behalf arrangements for bringing together for the purposes of sale property belonging to two or more Departments in canes &quot;in which the Disposal Beard are of opinion that this was the most advantageous method.The War Office and the Advisory Council on their part also contemplate that&apos; certain classes of commodities will be dealt with to better advantage by the Departments than by the Central Authority but they wish to provide for this by giving the control over all commodities in the first instance to the Central Authority and allowing that Authority to delegate the duty of selling to the Department only when it sees fit to do so.The Ministry of Munitions while willing to entrust certain of their surplus property to a Central Board to dispose of are of opinion that the work of disposal of the bulk of it is &amp;o closely bound-up with their supply contracts that it will have to be performed by themselves and claim that they must be the judges as to what they shall hand over and what they shall retain.The Advisory Council are also anxious that the two separate and more or less independent bodies should bee abolished and a single Authority&apos;created with executive powers to constitute a separate Government Department under a responsible Minister.This of course would require legislation.On 4th March 1918 an Order in Council was passed con-stituting the two bodies:   the Advisory Council to consist of a Chairman appointed by the Crown, not more than twelve members appointed by the Minister of Reconstruct ion,:two appointed by the Treasury and one each by the Admiralty, Army Council, Air Council.. Ministry of Munitions, Pirst Commissioner&apos;of Works and Board of Trade:   and the Disposal Board to consist of a Chairman and not more than two members appointed by the Crown, two members appointed by the Treasury, one each by tho Admiralty, Army Council and Minister of Munitions,.together&apos;with when dealing with property under the control of the department other than^the aoove,. one member appointed by that Department.In the recital of the Order in Council the Advisroy Council   is described as a body   &quot;to whom shall be reported all sOores, land, and other property (except shipping and Government Factories-) under the control of Government Departments being property acquired for the purpose of thepresent
&quot;present War and. no longer required for the purposes of the &quot;Departments uncor&apos; the control of which it is, in order that &quot;the Council may subject to the direction of the Minister of &quot;Reconstruction consider and advise as to the manner in v/hich rrthe same is to be dea.lt with whether by transfer thereof to 9some other Department or by sale or disposal thereof to publi,o &quot;authorities or to other persons.&quot;&quot;The recital described the Disposal Beard as established &quot;for the purpose of carrying into effect the recommendations of &quot;the Surplus Government Property Advisory Council as to the &quot;disposal on behalf of and in consultation with the respective &quot;Departments having control.thereof of any such property as may be notified to them bv the Council as available for disposal &quot;with power,cn the part of the Board.to enter into negotiations &quot;and conclude contracts for that purpose,&quot;At the time the Order in Council was passed it was con-temulated that -tho Disposal Board would be responsible to the respective Ministers of. tho Departments ef Those property tjiey were from time to time disposing,  the control of those Ministers be-in--; exercised through a power of veto to be given to the Departmental representative concerned in each case.   Difficul-ties however arose in parrying out this suggestion&apos;and the Chancellor of tho Exchequer asked the Minister of Reconstruction (Dr* Addison) to take responsibility for both bodies which in that case would have been instructed by Treasury Minute to act under his directions.Dr. Addison however was not satisfied as to the propriety, in vie1  of the terms of the Ministry of Reconstruction Act, of his assuming executive functions and the Chancellor there-upon asked Sir Albert Stanley to allow them to be placed under the Board cf Trade,   . -Sir Albert Stanley after looking into the matter has conn,  to the conclusion that the idea cf a centralised sales executive acting more or less independently of the Departments is unworkable and he has suggested a soheme of which a copy is annexed, for- putting the whole arrangements upon a new footing.Under this scheme an Advisory Council is proposed to be set up on which trade interests will be represented who would consider and, advise both the Government and the Interdepart-mental Sales Committee which he proposes to establish, on questions cf general policy.The Sales Committee would be a Joint Committee of the various Departments concerned with an independent Chairman of high commercial standing which would lay down the lines on which the business was to be conducted the&apos; actual executive work to be carried out by the Departments themselves. In the event of differences of opinion, between the Sales Committee and the Departments the question, would be referred&apos; to a Committee cf Ministers who would - also exercise general supervision on behalf of the Government as a.whole.e   Owing to the complicated nature of: the subject and the difficulty in obtaining agreement- between Departments, I am of opinion that the best course will hp to set up,a Committee presided- over by a. member of the War Cabinet with tho Ministers of the various Departments concerned and Lord Salisbury,, to   ./ examine and report upon the best method of obtaining a proper&apos; disposal of surplus Government, property, and I ask tho approval of the War Cabinet to this-proposal,(iritd.)

DISPOSAL OjT dURPLUS STORES.Tho present arrangement of an Advisory Council and Disposal [Board (With numerous Committees) under no particular authority (has admittedly failed and various alternatives have been proposed, feo far as these retain the Surplus Stores Disposal Board, they are lopen to the objection that they involve the creation of an elaborate [central capital selling organisation whilst the Departments princip-lally concerned &amp;ave each their Own highly organised Buying [Organisation which oould apparently be also employed successfully&apos; las a soiling Organisation.    In the Admiralty this is. already done.,. Sand there would seem to be no reason why the V/ar Office and Ministry Jof-Munitions should not do the same.   The scheme new pat forward &apos; proposes to make use of these existing organisations, subject to Itfte control of a Joint Committee as described therein, with a Chair-&apos; jman, not representative of any of the Departments concerned, but &apos; [responsible to tho Department to whom the appointment of the Committee Iis entrusted. - -   -An Advisory Council is also contemplated including mombers representing Commercial, and labour interests and representatives of Government Departments, to whom questions involving trade policy can be referred by the Chairman of the Joint Committee or by representative bodies of Traders or by Government Departments, andthe ultimate appeal authority would be a Committee of Ministers. It would seem quite desirable that these two latter Committees should be the same bodies that will deal with Post-^ar priorities.   This course would avoid undue multiplication of Committees, and it is clear that the classes of questions involving trade policy that are likely to arise in connection with the.disposal of Government stores are in many respects akin to those&apos; which arise in connection with priority,ALTER5ATIVS SCHEME EOR DISPOSAL Q3T SURPLUS STORES11.
