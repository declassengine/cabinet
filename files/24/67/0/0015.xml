BASES OF POLICY CONCERNING GERMAN COLONIES AND TURKISH POSSESSIONS.

(Note by Lord Curzon).

I. GERMAN COLONIES.

On general grounds it is undesirable that any of the German Colonies captured by the Allied Forces should be restored to Germany,

Reasons. (1) Misgovernment by Germany in past.

(2) Interests and desires of the native chiefs and populations.

(3) Safety of sea communications of powers owning over-sea possessions, and of maritime trade routes of the world.

(4) Avowed ambitions and designs of German Government and German spokesmen.

(5) Menace to future peace of world.

(A) GERMAN COLONIES IN ASIA AND IN PACIFIC OCEAN.

(i) Tsing-Tau.

Reasons. (1) If Colony be restored at all it should be not to Germany, but to China.

(2) Menace to China of a recovered German foot-hold on the Chinese mainland.

(3) Certain refusal of the Japanese Government.

(4) Engagement of the British and the Japanese Government.

(ii) Pacific Islands.

(a) North of the Equator.

Reasons. Certain refusal of Japanese Government to evacuate - and engagement of British Government to them.

(b) South of the Equator., i.e. New Guinea, Samoa, and smaller groups of islands.

Reasons. (1) Feeling of Dominion Governments by whose forces they were occupied and who now administer them.

(2) Interests of native populations.

(3) Menace of German Naval and submarine bases and wireless stations in Pacific.

(4) Insignificance of German interests in smaller groups.


(B) GERl AIT CQLOHSS va AFRICA.Gcncrrl reasons against restoration: -(1) Gortan treatment of native peoples.(2) Explicit statements of Gormen Government andrut.&quot;critics as to nature, and objects of a German African Empire.(3) Danger of Black army.(4) Attitude and feelings of native peoples.(5) Naval, military and Political menace tc world-peace of a German African Umpire.These considerations affect tho British Empire in partiou* lar, hut apply also to the remaining nations of the world. (The economic question and supply of raw materials must be separately considered.)particular/Coloni es,(i) *&apos;ist Coast, i.et Togoland and 0nmeroens.Reasons -   (l) Shocking cruelties of Germans in Cameroons.(2) Danger to world-peace of German naval bases end wireless stations on -Jest Coast fronting the Atlantic, (Duala,  etc.)The situation in tht.se Colonies is affected by an arrangc-ment between Great Britain and prance,  entered into after their joint military oocupation, under which the greater part of them is placed at present in the hands of prance.Should any concession to the African Colonial, aspirations of Germany in the last resort be forced upon us, it could be made,&apos; not without great danger, but with less danger, here than on the South--Vest or East Co;:st of the African Continent,(ii) German..South ?cst Africa;  -It is inconceivable that this colony should be restored to Germany.Reasons -   (1) Appalling story of. tho Herreros,(2) Safety of South African Commonwealth.(3) Occupation by,  and attitude of, South African Gcvernment.(iii) German East Africa.All the general reasons against restoration apply with especial force to this colony, viz; feelings and interests of native populations,  certainty cf ferocious German retribution in the event of restitution, menace of such a colony, as the nucleus of a Central African dominion, to the, safety of the   &apos; Indian ocean, the security of the neighbouring nnd/the weaker African colonies of Belgium, Portugal and France.To
To these must he added in the ease of Gorman East Africa the great and proltnged military effort put forward by the combined British forces (i.e. British, Indian, South African and native), the expenditure of blood and treasure in the recovery of these territories, and the strong feelings enter-tained in India,These are powerful rand unanswerable arguments against the reotcration of German East Africa to Germany.     As regards the future of that colony, Great Britain is more concerned to provide against these dangers than to add to her own terr-tcries or to assume additional responsibilities - though it must be remarked that the menace of a recovered German East Africa will be directed in the main&apos; against the British Empire, both by land and sea.The only alternatives to German re-occupation are :-(l)   Handing over to another European Power, cf whom it may be said that Prance has no direct or immediate interest in that part of Africa, and Belgium and Portugal are too weak to defend their existing .possessions.(2)   Handing over to America.(3/   Internatlocalisation, i,e, the setting up of a pOndpminium of Powers *? admittedly the most un*.* profitable&apos;of all forms of Government, resulting in international jealousies and friction, in the playing up of several interests, and in the consequent neglect cf native progress.(4)   Government by the European Power which has conquered or occupies them, or has the largest local interests, subject to the directions or advice of an International Board, chaiged not with administrative duties,, but with the control of raw materials, and the evolution of an International policy as regards tariffs, liquor trade, protection of native races, railway development &amp;c.Such a solution, if found acceptable, might equally be applied to Togoland and the Cameroons.II,   TURKEY,  -TURKISH POSSESSIONS IN ICSSOPOTAMIA, SYRIA m:c PA1ESTINE.^n general   grounds it is inconceivable that these should in any case be restored tc Turkish rule, because of(a) the character of that rule ** in itself an alien rule -marked by centuries of mis-government, and stained with almost incredible barbarities and crimes;(b) the pledges given by the Governments and spokesmen Of the Powers who have emancipated their peoples:(0) . the actual treaties and engagements entered into with the Arab State and with King Hussein, whose Government is already in concrete existence in a large part of the recovered territories:U)
the attitude of the native populations, w/to could not in a single case he returned to Turkish rule without the most violent protests from, and peril to, themselves:the now thoroughly exposed and fully understood ambitions of Germany and Turkey in combination to secure a roadway to the East, to threaten the pol-itical peace of Egypt, Arabia, Persia and Afghanist tan, and to strike at the - Suez Canal on the one hand, and India on the other.Further, the future of these territories is affected by en-gagements entered into since the beginning of the war by the Eur-opean Powers who have either assisted to conquer them or have definite/interests therein.     These Powers are Great Britain, France and Italy,     Russia was included at an earlier stage, but has now by her own action dropped out.     The particular provisions of these agreements have been to some extent rendered obsolete by the passage of time and the conditions of the war,     But they render it im-possible to make any provision as to the future, except with the conburrence of those Powers.Subject to the above conditions, the position in $he several territorities referred to is as follows:-(i) Mesopotamia.    (From Mosul to the Persian Gulf.)This territory has been recovered exclusively by British and Indian forces and is now administered by native and British cfficials in combination.     Here the policy of the British Govern-ment - openly declared in published proclamations - has been the setting up of native self-governing institutions, as part of a Confederation of Arab States.     Orderj peace and prosperity have already been restored to the greater part of the occupied terri-tcries, and it only remains for the Arabs to develop the &quot;requisite political organisation and stability, which cannot be done without the aid and support, financial, political, and material, of a civilised Power.(ii) Syria,.     Similar conditions apply to Syria, now.for the most part in the occupation of the Allied forces under General Allenby.     Here the fabric of an Arab administration is being rapidly built up, and the Amir Faisal (son of King Hussein) is already ruling at Damascus.     Here, hevvever, the European interest and influence corresponding to that which is exercised by the British in Mesopotamia, falls to the French;   and the administra-tive and financial support which are required to give strength and stability to the native Government will be supplied by thenu. (iii) Palestine.     The inter-allied agreements already referred to, contemplated an international administration cf Palestine. Such a solution, would, it is believed, be profoundly unacceptable to the native population, itself, to the Zionists, who are return1-ing in large numbers to Palestine, and to the Arab Government.     It would furthermore be the source of very certain trouble in the future.Local opinion would undoubtedly prefer administration by a , single power and if we are to rely upon the evidence that we have received would without hesitation pronounce for Great Britain.The British Government is not anxious, unless called upon, to charge itself with such a task, and would willingly welcome the appearance of America as the tutelary Christian r-ower in Palestine,, acting as the trustee of ihs Christian World as a whole, for the political control and administracive development cf the Holy Land.(Intd.)
