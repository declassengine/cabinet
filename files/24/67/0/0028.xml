/This Document is 5.1^:2 ?I*L L. fcCirculated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.j &apos; MiXThe Future of the German Colonies.I notice from the Papers that I have received that the War Cabinet is busy discussing the future of German Colonies. Before any decision is taken on this matter 1 should like to place on record my views. -I am in agreement with those who hold and I think this is the unanimous view -that no German Colony should be given back at the end of the war to Germany. The arguments which are summarised in Lord Curzon&apos;s most recent Paper appear to me to be conclusive, but I hope we shall base ourselves not on the desire of any &quot;Dominion for a particular island or tract of country, but on the gross mismanagement of these Colonies by the Germans in the past, and on the necessity of being assured by actual experience and by practical and effective guarantees that there is no danger that these countries could be used to interrupt sea traffic or as bases for submarine activities.I cannot help thinking thaj; it may be difficult to get the American Government to see that our motives in this matter are not selfish. But it seems to me that if we obtain as we must obtain America&apos;s assent to the principle that these countries ,shall not be given back to Germany, we ought to be prepared to accept any arrange-ment which she would prefer to satisfy her that they are to be held in trusteeship for the good of the inhabitants and of the world in general, and not for any selfish ends. These considerations incline me to prefer Lord Curzon&apos;s alternative (4) as probably the most acceptable solution.But in the discussions, which I have been privileged to hear, I notice that the country which is most loosely held, the country on \yhich members of the Imperial^ War Cabinet seem to be most ready to compromise, iiTGerman East Africa. I would-^ 5 /3 implore the War Cabinet to consider, and to consider seriously, the Indian situation. I circulated to the War Cabinet on this subject a Paper by Sir Theodore Morison on the 16th July. It has never been referred to by anybody since, from which I conclude that it has not produced the slightest effect, And yet the matter is very serious. India is a congested country. There &quot;is not in India a possibility of suitably rewarding with land a fraction of the soldiers who have placed their services at the disposal of the Empire, and it is land above all things that the Indian soldiers and peasants want. I do submit with all the urgency that I can command that we shall be guilty of a grave dereliction of Imperial duty if we do not see that the Indian has some opportunity of colonization, arising out of the Indian partnership in this war, in the countries in conquering Avhieh India has played so conspicuous a part.The question of Indian immigration into Mesopotamia, which has really been conquered by Indian soldiers and liberated from the Turk by luclian soldiers, has never been settled. The difficulties are very great, and although I hope and believe that we shall never consent to any policy of excluding Indians from Mesopotamia, there do not seem to me to be large opportunities there.German East Africa does offer great possibilities. I do not think that we can help regarding the position of Indians who wish to settle in our Dominions as very unsatisfactory. It is true that by agreements as to reciprocity and by certain ameliorations that have beeu sympathetically considered by Dominion Prime Ministers, some of the acerbities of the position are being removed, and the best construction possible will be placed on the situation, but the fact remains, and every Indian knows it, that Plis Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects are not welcomed, and indeed barely tolerated, in many of the countries flying the British Hag, and that at present they do not get in all cases as favourable treatment as other Asiatics such as the Japanese. This is undoubtedly resented in India,, and is undoubtedly opposed to the whole principle upon Avhich the Empire is based, a partnership of free and equal nations and races.Almost every day some new fact comes to light which shows that we are noAvhere near getting good treatment for our Indian fellow-subjects in- the British Empire. I am only now in correspondence with the Colonial Office about the prohibition of Indians from residing in certain parts of Mombasa.   Many of these questions areSS 6   45  10/18
without a solution, and they are without a solution at a time when they are increasing in their evil effect in India, when they are becoming more widely known by reason of better communication and greater travel in India, when I think it is safe to say that racial discrimination and racial prejudice do us more harm in India than almost anything else.German East Africa does offer a possibility of free colonisation to Indians, and I must press the Cabinet in considering the disposal of German Colonies to consider this great Imperial question with the utmost care. ,I have nothing to say about the countries rescued from Turkish domination, save to repeat that I am a little doubtful whether the Americans have the necessary experience to offer a welcome instrument of government to a Mohammedan country such as Palestine, and whether they can be relied upon effectively to prevent the penetration of that country by Germans disguised as Zionists.E. S. M.18th October 1918.
