^^^E^J^ope^yjfHis Britannic MdeBtVg Government..!Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1918.&quot; SECRET.] Ti&amp;^Uf- *j WAR PLEDGES BlLL-I CIRCULATE the following memorandum by Sir Stephenson Kent.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.October 17, 1918.I have read memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Reconstruction, and the Air Minister dealing with this subject.In the first place, I wish to make my position clear in the matter. At Dr. Addison&apos;s request, the Inter-departmental Committee, of which I was Chairman, drafted a Bill incorporating the various pledges dealing with the question of restoration, and it was no part of the Committees duty to express an opinion on the matter.In view, however, of the memoranda to which I have referred, I should wish to express my own personal opinion.In my view, the Government must either implement its pledges, or give in lieu thereof a constructive policy on liberal and far-seeing lines which will meet to some considerable extent the aspirations which labour has so often expressed regarding its future well-being.In my opinion,, the second alternative should be adopted, for the following-reasons :-Not even labour, who are clamouring for the Bill, really intend to insist upon the literal fulfilment of the restoration for which it purports to provide. They admittedly want it only as a basis for bargaining or contracting out of its literal terms. This leaves things to be settled by agreement between capital and labour, and in view of the transition and reconstruction period through which we must pass, I do not think it possible to hope that any such agreement can be reached without considerable delay if it is to cover the ground and at the same time satisfy the various interests involved. Moreover, I am strongly of opinion that the whole subject is one of such magnitude and importance to the national well-being that the Government cannot leave the matter to a lengthy process of haggling between competitive interests.Further, while the more acute and immediate problem may principally concern the general engineering employers and the skilled craft unions, it is unthinkable that upon the conclusion of hostilities any pronouncement of labour policy can be made which does not lay down certain main principles which must include, inter alia, a colossal programme providing for the erection of additional housing, and improved housing conditions, the reduction of hours, security of employment, &amp;c.The various aspects of the whole question are so closely bound up with each other as to make it impossible, even were it not undesirable, for employers and labour to embark on negotiations which must infringe or perhaps run counter to the policy to be declared at some time or another by the Government. Decisions affecting the nation as a whole cannot be made by sectional interests.At the sanu time, I am bound, bo remind you that Ministerial pledges in the past in regard to restoration have been very definite and comprehensive, and it is impossible to shut one&apos;s eyes to the fact that labour interests are very insistent on the introduction of a Bill on the lines already submitted to them in the summer of last year. I am afraid that the alleged delay by the Government in dealing with the matter for the last twelve months will not make it any easier to secure an agreement to alternative proposals at this date.STEPHENSON KENT.October 16, 1918.
