JocumcAmended Copy0CIIiCULATSJJ TO EF3 Kli-TG- AND V/AJcH CABINET.Notes on an Armistice.6045.An armistice should provide 1.   Security against resumption of war by the enemy,For this purpose it is necessary(a) To occupy such strategic positions as will place the enemy in a hopeless position if he renews hostilities on land;-   a purely military problem,.(b) To obtain possession (or at least control) of so many Submarines and Battle Cruisers (query raiders also?) as will prevent him renewing hos-tilities by sea;-   a purely Naval problem,11,   An armistice should provide for the irrmocV;a\e &apos;occupation of as many as possible of those districts which we mean permanently to take from the&apos; enemy e0g. Alsace and Lorraine nnd the Trentino,    The reason being that whatever else happens, it is most unlikely that Germany wouldrrenew
renew the war to recover what she nan clearly lost, though she might do no In order to retain what she still holds. . Moreover the burden of the final peace negotiations would be lightened if these most contentious problems were more than half settled already. .111.   In addition to 1 and 11 it seems of the greatest importance that we should occupy as much territory which we do not mean to keep an will provide an adequate   pledge for the fulfilment of the pecuniary and other conditions which we pro-nose to exact under the final terms of peace.   This last condition seems hardly fulfilled by the Field Marshal&apos;s scheme - if I rightly understand it.   He proposes to occupy Alsace and Lorraine which the Allies desire to keep, hut no territories VThich properly belong to the German Satire,   If, however, we do this, how are we to ensure the performance of any conditions we may exact with regard to Eastern Europe, and how are we to secure the huge pecuniary reparation which will be required for Belgium, France, Italy, Serbia and Roumania?    The Germans in 1871 arranged for an occupation of French territory until the final payment of the indemnity.   Ought we not to do something Similar?It
It may perhaps be replied, that we possess in the Blockade an instrument less invidious and much . lore e-^iiy applied than territorial occupation, yet sufficiently powerful to do all v/e want,   The point fliouid be examined.-    But I would observe that the machinery of Blockade, which must I suppose be in any case retained for -purpose* of international &quot;rationing long after pence is declared, is very difficult to work and very unpopular &apos;  It cannot be applied, to Germany alone,- for it must necessarily involve the neutrals who border on Germany, and through whom Germany could otherwise import whatever she wanted.   Would it be possible or desireable to continue this artificial system beyond its natural term, merely to. compel Germany to pay her debts and fulfil her other obligations?    I seriously doubt i t.-(Initialled)    A, Jfl B,FOhEIGN OFFICE,October 20th, 1910,
