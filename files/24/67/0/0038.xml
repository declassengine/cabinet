Memorandum by the President 1 np,w   ,4^/7 of the Board of Trade. I JlJI circuktto a Memorandum by tho Controller of Horse Transport asking that an additional allocation of 200,000 tons of shipping for Oats for Town Horses may be agreed to. I hope that, in view of the considerations urged by Mr.Selbie, sanction may be given to this proposal.   It must, however, be borne in mind that the quantity asked for is the absolute minimum required and it may be necessary at a later date to ask for some additional amount.A.H.STANLEY.Board of Trade,18th October,1918.MEMORANDUM BY THE CONTROLLER OF HORSE TRANSPORT.Calculations based on tho Census of Horses taken in April 1917 show that the number of horses (other than agricul-tural horses and young horses under 3 years of age) engaged in essential transport work is at least 500,000.The cereal food-stuffs which it is possible to feed to horses, apart from Oats, are Maize. Beans, Peas, Brewers1 Grains and Bran.&apos; With the possible exception of Maize, none of these commodities can be used,even if available, as a substitute for Oats, but only for mixing with that gra-in.  So far as Brewers1 Grains and Bran are concerned these are mainly used for cattle feeding purposes and are to be strictly rationed during the owning year.   Arrangements have been made with the Ministry &amp;t Food for Town Horses to get a certain proportion but it will only be small, the maximum allowance contemplated being 2.lbs. per horse per day. After allowing for this, the following calculation shows the quantity oi grain required by 500,000 Town horses for twelve months to be fed in accordance-^.rr..,....:;.r.,r,- ,....,.r-.,,...... ;r.......,.. ... ^ ; ,, .......       ....... ....
with the Rations laid down by the Order:-LBS TONS TONSiU    EEL250,000 at  11     :    37,342    :   448,103 250,000   &quot;    13     s    44,131    t    529,576 .Total     JZLSnjona.To meet this in thSnpresent cereal year the following is all the provision made:-Oat a to be imported from the Plate.............120,000 tons*    &quot;  -  imported from Ireland............... 30,000  &quot;&quot;    H  &quot;  purohased in Scotland............... 15,000  &quot;Stock of American--Oats now at the Ports.......T100?000  &quot;Total     ?$5fQQQ toniThis leaves a balance of 712,000 tons which in the absence of any further allocation of shipping for oats or maize must be provided from iocme-grown oats.  In view howerar of the increased requirements of Farmers, owing to the shortage of Cake and other Cattle feeding-stuffs, it is extreme-ly unlikely that the same quantity of Oats will be available for Town horses as was obtained from this source last year. Assuming nevertheless that this is possible and that as much Maize is allotted to Town horses as last year, an additional allocation of shipping for 200,000 tons will be essential to meet the minimum requirements.It is fully realised that at the present time this is a sarious claim on tonnage in view of the pressure for ships for other purposes, but the need is an urgent one and cannot otherwise be met.  It is necessary, if the town transport work is to be carried on efficiently, that the cereal rations laid down (which aro below those generally in use before the War) Bhould be assured to the horses.  In order to secure the most rigid economy in the use of the Oats, it is proposed only to issue them on a system of certificates to owners of ;tos4onga^l in *s**tiiiaJhwxrrk.R.H.
