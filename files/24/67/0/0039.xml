Memorandum by tho President of the Board of Trs&amp;o.I circulate a Memorandum &quot;by the Controller of Timber Supplieswith which I concur.&apos;     I shall &quot;bo clad to have on early decisionof the War Cabinet on the proposals it contains.Board of Trade,&apos; A. H. STANLEY.18th October, 1913.-.---oOo-----MBMORAHDUM .The present position of the timber supplies of the country is such that I consider myself justified in placing the facts befort you in order that definite action may be taken to enforce economy in the use of timber by Government departments and their Con-tractors, and in other directions.    You will probably recollect that ft cut of 1,800,00.0 tons in imported timber was made at the beginning cf the present year by the War Cabinet, this being agreed to after I had obtainsd from the Departments their -estimated requirements for the year.     These estimated requir3ments totalled under ^jDOOjOOO^stmdards, but, owing to various circurn-stances, tQTrs&quot;Tigure&apos;wllTTe&quot;&quot;isoeeded by 200.000 standards, or 900000   tons.    The result will be that by the 3n5To2? Tfoe present year the available stocks of timber in the country will be so reduoed as to only barely cover two months-demands ahead, which is a very narrow margin.    To oope .wTu nEEe Increased demands our home-grown timber has been exploited to an enormous extent, the output now being 850 per cent, greater then at this time last year, and has now about reached its maximum.     I have advised the War Office that I am unable to continue sending Supplies of timber to Prance for the use of our Armies in that country, and as regards imported timber generally we have only been able to obtain tonnage to lift about half  the material required to meet the demands for War purposes, the result being the shrinkage of stocks above referred to.    Steps have been and are continually being taken to reduce the consumption of timber for essential civil needs.To meet the situation I recommend after careful consideration:-1.   That tonnage should be provided beyond what lias already been arranged by the Shipping Controller to lift at least 50,000 standards between now and the end of the current year.2.   That instructions should be issued forth with-to all Departments that an immediate out of 33-1/3 per cent, be made in their indents and demands for timber of all y descriptions, and that they should make every possible effort to relax their specifications and inspections to the utmost limit compatible with safety.J. B. BAIL.Controller of Timber Supplies. October 17th, 1918.
