^CAB//v^n    MII1UTS   TO   THE   WAg   0A3ISET.&quot; y-&apos; &apos; \ -- 1 q Rn TO, I   0^72- leth October, 191f.The question of appropriate celebrations of American Thanksgiving Day (Thursday 88th November) has been brought before the Minister of Information both by the American and the British Advisory Committee to the Department of Hospi-tallty to the American   Forces of this Ministry.Their view, which 1 support, is that the American troops stationed in this country will celebrate Thanksgiving Day as a public holiday in any event.   These troops would find it strange that no one else should share their national festival, and this fact would tend to make them feel complete strangers in.England.   I understand that it is the policy cf His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend every courtesy to American troops in this country, and to make them feel, as far as is possible, that they are among friends and not among strangers.I would suggest that the difficulty could be met if a celebration of the British victories in the war were held on the same date.   It is probable that Hie Majesty&apos;s Government would desire to set apart a day for this purpose in any event, and It would be an excellent plan to make the two days coincide.I would therefore ask the War Cabinet to consider theiquestion of proclaiming Thursday the 86th November as a pu&amp;Lic holiday to celebrate and give thanks for the British victories.%BEAVERBROOK.
