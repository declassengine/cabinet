-A[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC 1/IATESTY&apos;S G0V3RMSNT]CRET.T. 6055.WAR CABINET.FEEDING STUFFS POSITION.Memo by the President of the Board of Agriculture.The War Cabinet on&apos;September 6th 1918 (W.C.470 Minute 9) substantially approved the programme of the Food Controller and the Board in respect to the importati on of feeding stuffs for live-stock for 1918-19.     On October 1st 1918 (V/.C*480 Minute 6) it reversed that decision, and decided to reduce the importation of animal foods in the first six months of 1918-19, considerably below the bare minimum which the Board of Agriculture considered to \$ necessary for the maintenance of the livestock of the country and of the ordinary supply of both milk and meat.    The first decision secured the delivery of the feeding stuffs in the winter months, when they are roost urgently needed;     the second decision postpones delivery till the Spring, when they are comparatively valueless. The anticipated results should be recorded.In the winter months, when the grass has failed, the livestock of this country depends partly on home-grown produce, partly on concentrated foods most of which are imported.(l)   The supply of home grown produce is diminished owing to the smaller crops of hay and roots and1 to the appropriation for human food of all the barley which is not required for brewing.    To some extent this loss may eventually be compensated by the amount of damaged wheat and barley.      It is estimated that 10$ of the wheat and 17$ of the barley in England and Wales are so damaged as to be unfit for human food.      But the restrictions on its use will not make this source of supply immediately available.(2)   The supply of concentrated foods is at the same time drastically reduced below the pre-war level owing to (a) the closer milling which lessens the quantity and quality of wheat offals; (b)   the greater importation of wheaten flour instead of grain, which again reduces the amount of wheat offals;   (c) the low reserve of stocks in hand which will be exhausted by the end of next month; (d) the reduced importation of productive fodder-stuffs.    In the yearB 1908-13 the average annual importation of these fodder-stuffs was 6,740,000 tons.    The Board&apos;s estimate of its minimum requirements for 1918-19 reduced this figure to 2,480,000 tons. But by the recent Cabinet decision it is cut down by a further 750,000 tons, or a reduction on pre-war averages of no less than 5,010,000 tons.In order to distribute these limited resources to the best advantage it is necessary to adopt a scheme of rationing concentrated foods, which allows a limited ration for milch cows, calves, and breeding sows, and nothing at all for fattening cattle or sheep, or for pigs after December.The effects that may be expected on the various classes of livestock may be thus summarised.1.    Milch Cows.      The dairy stock of England and Wales on June 4th 1918 has rTserTto 2,577.970 and 2,484,220 on June 4th 1914. The price for winter milk puts farmers on their mettle to maintain the supply.      They may be expected to supplement the low ration of concentrated food from their ho;.,e..gxown resources.    There would, therefore, be no reason to anticipate more than a 10$ reduction in the supply of nilko    But I now understand that the United States have decided to export no cake and no maize.    If this decision is adhered to, even the milch cows will nut receive their ration, and the whole supply of milk must be seriously jeopardised.
IGO2*    Boef Cattle,*   The beef cattle of England, and Wales on -Tuno 4th 191fif**nave risen to 3,622,520 from 3,393.724 on June 4th 1914. The difficulty of the present position is aggravated by the fact that the supply of cattle now ready to slaughter off the grass is greater than the Food Controller can handle      Those cattle, when returned from the market, can only, be maintained by consuming the scanty supplies of hay and root3, which eight to be reserved for preparing score cattle for the butcher in the spring,    Without any prospect of obtaining imported feeding stuffa, few farmers can be expected to attempt the winter fattening of cattle for the supply of beef from February to the end of Hay.    A decline in production must, therefore, be anticipated which has been variously estimated at from 20)2 to/*&amp;$. The output of meat then will certainly not meet the present ration.. This reduction will arouse widespread and bitter dissatisfaction!   It may then become necessary, under public pressure, to requisition and slaughter lean animals *     The wastage of such a course will be great, and out livestock capital will be so reduced as to diminish the output of meat for the whole of the following year.3*    Sh^s-o..   The sheep stock of England and Wales on June 4th 1918 has declined to 16,475,180 from 17,259,694 on June 4th 1914.     This decline has taken place almost exclusively in arable counties like Wiltshire and Hampshire, where the crops grown for isheep feeding require to be supplemented by concentrated foods for ewes and lambs. The withdrawal of this supplementary food will cause a further decline in flocks on arable land, and a consequent diminution in the later output of mutton and lamb, as well as of wool.4*    ?3$ 3 2llLh9J^3.*     ^e greatest difficulty is already experienced In obtaining food for transport horses.    The supply of foreign oats for which the Board had budgeted is cut off by the Cabinet decision.     Farmers, speaking generally, will require all their home-grown oats to feed their livestock.     They can buy nothing tc replace them.    They will, therefore, be unwilling to sell what they have and any attempt to requisition their oats for civilian purposes would produce something like an organised revolt. &apos;   Transport horses at any rate must, it is.submitted, be supplied by importation either from Ireland or from overseas.5*     ?- s--   Tiae        stock of England and Wales on June 4th 1918 had declined to- 1,697,070 from 2,481,481 on June 4th 1914, in spite of the considerable increase effected by the campaign of the Board in the present y^ar,     Though it was impossible to secure the promised supply of offals, etc., a large number of cottagers, small-holders, clubs, and local authorities were encouraged, at their own expense, to keep pigs.     Pig-keepers of this class depend on an allowance of offals and cake, which was included in th-3 minimum requirements of feeding stuffs submitted by the Board.     The withdrawal of this supply in many cases necessitates the slaughter of this stock of pigs before the New Ysar;   it inflicts heavy loss on a number of small men who had been encouraged to enter on the industry;     young pigs will not be bred for a start next spring;   and a heavy fall in the output of pork must be expected next year.     For purposes of reconstruction it is essential to obtain at least a sufficient ration of concentrated food for the maintenance of pedigree herds.-It is true that the United States of America *,are willing to send to this country an adequate supply of pig meat.    But this substitution of a foreign import for a home-grown product, though it results in a gain of tonnage, means the waste of the great quantity of refuse which the pig consumes.     It will not as a policy be commended to British farmers by the following extract frcm a letter from a Vice President of the Cudahy Packing Company, quoted en page 45 of the summary of the report of the Federal Trade Commission presented to the President of t&amp;e United States, July 3, 1918, on the Keat Packing Industry:-&quot;There never was a time in the history of the business when we have had as good a margin on the hogs for as long a stretchcontinuously
IS!continuously and naturally it has made everyone very greody to kill every hog they possibly could.    I don&apos;t suppose any of us have wasted much time figuring out whether we could or could not handle the business when we saw a chance to land a big allotment over at the Pood Administration.    The main idea that we had in mind was that it was profitable bueiness and the firBt thing to do was to take the order and then get through with it some way or other&quot;.R. 3l PH0TK3R0.23rd October, 1918.
