THE USB OP NATIONAL FACTORIES AFTER THE WAR.Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.*L^J! tlx2.olol0 0L^e Memorandum from the Demobilisation and ?S2ffi?J5S^I0ll.8CB51 ttSev?f fc\e M^istry of Munitions reoontly -SSSW fc0 *ho,WaS ?,al)iGGt     the HiSister of Munitions the 0LlK5d 0Lthe ^e to which the national &quot;factories ?MJLo^l\f!eJ&apos;th0 war.^- It is suggested that, while some ot them.should be disposed of to private industry others should5L *A?&amp;!a by thS ?vtatS m&amp; used for Government Manufacture of commodities;    and the War Cabinet is asked for a declaration of2Sii2y *5JS ^f! a?i^loi.2? 5la*s of artioles the Government would conaidor itself justified in manufacturing in national factories.   On this matter the following note is submitted.&apos;,      If there are any things which the Government decides that it will be desirable to manufacture permanently in national factories (*,g, armaments) it will, of course, be well to retain and use national factories for that purpose.   But for the Govern-ment to undertake manufacturing work because the factories are there, and not because the things to be made in them are specially&quot; suitable for Government manufacture would be exceedingly dangerous, The essential need after the war is that ordinary industry should?&apos;Ot restarted as soon as possible in an atmosphere of confidence, f private firms are threatened with Government competition, he extent and fore? of which it will be impossible for them to garoje beforehand, they can hardly fail to be discouraged and their recovery can hardly fail to be checked.   This effect is likely to be tho more serious since thoy will kDc*w that for a time at least the Government is bound to continue some measure of control over the distribution of materials, and they will naturally suspect that this control will bo exercised with a bias inxavour of the Governments own factories.   The right policy would seom to be for the Government to decide what, if anything1 it thinks ought to be manufactured permanently by the Statewlthout any reference to the fact that there happens Jo be a number of factories in State hands, and.thus to retain for itselt only such number of factories as arc roquirod.for this purpose. Air the others should be sold or leased to private li^ustry.    It should, moreover, be emphasised that in coming to their decision  , as to what things it is desirable for the State 2*^*4*^*11 manufacture ^Government would do well.to exerSise great caution. If it is over hasty it will almost certainly find afterwards that it is undertaking work for which it is not well gualifoed.^^ the result that muchpublic money may.be wast e4. or it ^t be omitting to undertake work which it is strictly in the National interest that it should execute.A.H.STArai.Board of Trade..15th October, 1918,
