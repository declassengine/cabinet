WAR CABINET.

DEMOBILISATION.

MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.

1. In view of the present military situation it is clearly essential that as a precautionary measure steps should be taken at once to ensure that we are ready to deal with the resettlement of labour when hostilities come to an end.

2. For this purpose the first and most essential step is the appointment of a Sub-Committee of the War Cabinet with full powers to take the necessary measures and to review the whole situation.

3. A great deal of thought has been given to the necessary plans in this connection but owing to the preoccupation of the Government and the country in the prosecution of the war, it has been inevitable that the plans and arrangements in general lack the approval in detail, or in some cases the legislative sanction, which is necessary before they can be carried into effect.

4. It is clear that owing to the imperative need for immediate decisions the position cannot be met by the ordinary course of departmental action, and further, that as regards the more important questions of policy, we cannot afford the delay that would be involved by leaving them to take their chance among the numerous other problems that must come before the full Cabinet. The only course, which, in my opinion, is commensurate with the urgency and importance of the case is that the Cabinet should refer the whole question of the resettlement of labour including the requirements of the Ministry of Labour in respect of staff and promises, to a small Sub-Committee with the fullest possible powers to come to a decision and give instructions with regard to the points involved. I would therefore press for the appointment of such a Committee at the earliest possible moment to deal with Resettlement, and suggest that it should consist of two members of the Cabinet with representatives of the War Office. Treasury and Ministry of Labour. It may be found desirable to appoint a further Cabinet Committee to deal with the whole subject of the control of industry and commerce, and raw materials. These two subjects are so big that I do not feel that they could be adequately handled by one Committee.

5. As showing the urgency of the appointment of such a Committee I would point out that in the event of an armistice instant decisions would be required with regard to the method of dealing with many thousands of munition workers whose services would no longer be required on the unproductive manufacture of shells and explosives. Apart from this, if we are to be prepared to deal with the problem of resettlement, the general lines of the policy and the arrangements to be adopted must be definitely settled forthwith, and in particular with regard to the methods according to which discharges from the Forces and from munitions works are to be regulated; the provision that should be made for unemployment arising either among ex-service men or among the rest of the civilian population; the training that should be provided for apprentices whose training has been interrupted by their service in the Forces; and finally the restoration of Trade Union conditions in accordance with the pledges that have been given.

6./

  
6. Not less important than the early determination of policy is the provision of the necessary staff and premises for carrying it out. The administrative work in connection with the resettlement of labour will fall upon the staff of the Ministry of Labour and it is absolutely essential that the staff and premises of my Department should be adequate for the task. In both these respects my Department has, during the course of the war, bee hampered by the fact that it has not been treated as primarily a War Department. I do not complain of this, but I am certain that the time has now come when the requirements of my Department , as regards staff and premises should receive the treatment which, during the war, has bee extended to War Departments.

7. A more detailed account of the principal matters of policy to be decided and of the requirements of my Department in respect of staff and premises is given in the attached appendix.

8. I must also bring before the Cabinet one other matter affecting my Department without which it is impossible for me to make the preparations I feel are absolutely indispensable if we are to be in a position to meet the situation should an armistice take place in the near future. The staff of the Ministry of Labour is at present situated in three different buildings separated by a distance of nearly a mile from each other. I have more than one applied to the Committee on Accommodation during the war to remedy this state of affairs pointing out how difficult it is to secure rapid and efficient working unless the heads of all Departments are immediately available for consultation with myself and the Permanent Secretary. The Committee have felt, however, that they were bound to give priority to Departments more directly concerned with the war, and I have naturally acquiesced in their decision. As soon as war ceases, however, the burden which has been borne during the last four years by the War Departments will be to a great extent shifted to the Ministry of Labour. I feel that I am, therefore, justified in asking that it shall be given every facility for organising itself in the best possible manner. I must, therefore, ask either that a building should be put at our disposal which win accommodate the whole Department; or falling this, which I realise to be exceedingly difficult, that the temporary buildings in front and in roar of Montagu House should be handed over to us for the accommodation of the Employment Department. Those buildings are at present housing a staff of 700, while the staff of the Employment Department is at present 601, though it will require considerable expansion to deal with Demobilisation. I would point out that the premises at Queen Anne&apos;s Chambers, which are capable of accommodating some 600 to 700 persons, would thereby be released and could be handed over to the Ministry of Munitions.

APPENDIX.

I. Matters of Policy.

The following are among the chief matters of policy which require immediate settlement. Certain of those have already received the general approval of the Cabinet, but even in those cases there are certain matters of important detail which still require such approval.

(1) The methods according to which the release of men from the Forces should be regulated: in particular the arrangements for the release of "demobilisers" and "pivotal men" before the main demobilisation commences, and the arrangements for deciding the priority of release of individual members of the Forces during the period of demobilisation.

It has been decided in principle that demobilisation shall take place in accordance with industrial rather than military requirements, but consideration of the important proposals put forward for releasing "demobilisers" and "pivotal men" before the main demobilisation commences have been postponed by the Cabinet. It may now be too late to carry out the original proposals in full but if an immediate decision is given something may yet be done. As regards the order of release during demobilisation it is suggested that, so far as the grounds is not covered by the release of individuals for whom employment is assured, the priority to be given to particular trades should be decided by a Departmental Committee specially set up for the purpose.

(2) The methods and principles according to which the discharge of munition workers should be regulated.

This subject is dealt with in the memorandum submitted to the Cabinet on 11th October by the Minister of Labour, in which among other things, it is suggested that munition workers should receive a fortnight&apos;s notice of discharge (or wages in lieu of notice), that adequate notice of discharge should be given to the Employment Exchanges, and, most important of all, that discharges should not take place haphazard but should be regulated according to definite principles agreed beforehand between the factory managements and the local representatives of the Ministry of Labour together with their Local Advisory Committee representative of employers and employed,

(3) The provision of out-of-work donation to demobilised members of the Forces: its amount and the conditions under which it should be drawn.

This has been approved in principle by the Cabinet but the weekly amount of the donation remains to be settled together with certain other details - in particular the extent to which the donation should be applied to members of the Women&apos;s Corps.

(4) Further provision (in addition to the existing State Scheme which only provides 7s. a week for a portion of the workers) against unemployment among the civilian population during the period of resettlement.

This question has been under consideration, first by the Civil War Workers Committee appointed by the Minister of Reconstruction, and subsequently by the Labour Resettlement Committee appointed by the Minister of Labour. The latter Committee has not yet given final consideration to the matter but it is likely that it will recommend a temporary universal

scheme/ 
scheme of insurance against unemployment for the civilian population, the rates of benefit and contribution being respectively as follows:-

                                  Weekly Rate of                  Weekly Rate of

                                   Benefit.                       Contribution.

    Men ... ... ...                  15s.                            6d.

    Women . ... ...                  12s.6d.                         5d.



Should this universal scheme not be adopted it will still be necessary to increase the present rate of benefit (7s.) for the insured trades as this amount is quite inadequate, and a scheme for this purpose, which will have to be approved. Both these schemes may be vitally affected by the proposals that are now being put forward for making special grants of State money to industries in which unemployment is caused owing to the shortage of coal, and it is obviously most important that any emergency measures that are adopted in this connection should be such that they can be dovetailed into the more more general arrangements that may be adopted later on. Failing a contributory scheme it will be necessary to have a non-contributory scheme of insurance for a limited period. This subject is under the consideration of the Ministry of Labour.

(5) The provision of training to apprentices whose apprenticeship has been interrupted by service with the Colours.

A scheme submitted by the Ministry of Labour has been approved by the Committee on Home Affairs and a Bill is being drafted.

(6)The policy to be adopted with regard to the restoration of Trade Union customs according to the pledges that have been given.

II Staff and Promises of the Ministry of Labour.

(1) The re-organisation and strengthening of the Head Office of the Employment Department on which will fall the main burden of the central administrative work in connection with the resettlement of labour.

This matter was exhaustively considered by a Departmental Committee on which the Treasury were represented and proposals were laid before the Treasury on 9th September, 1918. The work of the Employment Department will be enormously increased during the demobilisation period and it is clearly essential that the organisation at its centre should be adequate.

(2) The re-organisation and strengthening of the Claims and Record Office of the Employment Department at Kew, which will be the clearing house for dealing with the millions of "civil employment" forms that will be filled in by sailors and soldiers, and the numerous claims to unemployment benefit that will be made.

Proposals in this connection, are being prepared.

(3)The immediate release from the Army of all members of the permanent staff of the Department now serving with the Forces (numbering about 1,100 in all) in order that the Department may have sufficient stiffening of permanent staff to enable them to deal with the great increase of work that will arise.

(4) The engagement under proper conditions of a sufficient number of temporary staff.

The/
The great increase of work that will follow upon demobilisation will of necessity mean the engagement of large numbers of temporary staff and many, if not most, of those will have to be taken on before the release of the temporary staffs of the War Departments takes place, and also before ex-service men from the demobilised Army are available. It is desired to avoid the necessity for haphazard and hurried engagement of temporary staff at the last moment by making arrangements beforehand with regard to the methods of engagement and particularly the rates of pay. It is most important also that a certain number of further temporary staff should be engaged immediately in order that they may have some period of training before they are called upon to undergo the great strain that will arise when demobilisation actually commences.

(5) The acquisition of adequate and suitable premises for dealing with the ex-service men and others who will have to attend in the search of employment or for the receipt of unemployment benefit. It will be necessary to have powers to commandeer premises for this purpose and the Bill setting up legislative powers which had already been under consideration by the Cabinet should be introduced and passed without delay.

The existing premises of the Employment Exchanges will be quite inadequate in themselves as will be evident from a mere statement of the fact that the number of persons with whom they will have to deal will be multiplied by 3 or 4. The erection of new premises is obviously out of the question and the only method of dealing with the position is by the acquisition of temporary accommodation. For this purpose power to commandeer is absolutely essential: without it the premises could not in many cases be acquired quickly enough, and in a considerable number of cases could not be acquired at all.
