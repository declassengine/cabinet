-imiB DOCUMENT IS TAB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.)d faWAR CABINET.SECRET.G.T. ^016.THE NAVAL COMMAND IN THE NORTH AEGEAN.Le*ter from the Prirae Minister to the French &quot;&quot;&quot; P?es3&apos;&quot;di&quot;nt &quot;of the Council.(Giving effect to War Cabinet 484, Minute 4).10, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.V.I.X?th October, 1918.My dear M. Olemenceau,You will remember that at the recent Conference in Paris the question of the liaison between the land and naval forces which are about to advance on Constantinople was referred to a Conference of Naval Representatives at Versailles,    At that Conference the question of the command of the Naval Forces, was raised.    Admiral Hope, the British Representative proposed that the same arrangement should be made in.regard to the Naval Forces as we agreed to in the case of the military expedition; that is to say, that all operations should be under a British Admiral who would act generally under;the command of the French Commander-in-ChiefThis proposal was supported by the Italian Representative but was rejected by the French Representative.I write to you because it is essential that this question should be decided at once and because in my judgment., when the facts are examined, there can really be no doubt that the &apos;. command ought, to be under a British Admiral.   In the first plane, 1% of the craft to be employed will be British,    All, the Dreadnought battleships will be British, and 60% Of- the fighting ships will be British.     In the second place.the Aegean io and always haB been throughout the war a British zone...   Mudros on which the Naval Forces will be. based was established and has been maintained by Great Britain.     A British Admiral has always been in command in this theatre under the general orders of the Allied Commander-in-Chief,     In the third,place, the .eucoess of the attaok on Constantinople will largely depend on the quick understanding and close co-operation between land and sea. The majority of the land Forces as well as tho Commander on land will be British.     The majority of, the sea forces will also be British.     It must be obvious to everybody that if we are to aohieve the best yesults and to eliminate ,all risk of mis-understanding between the two arms, the Naval Commander should also be British.    ,&apos; - (Further there are the other reasons on which I laid stress when I was in Paris.   The, campaign against Turkey both by,land and sea has been mainly carried out by Great. BritAin*   We have taken by far the larger part of the burden of .the ,war against Turkey in the Dardanelles and Gallipcli, in Egypt,.in Mesopotamia and in Palestine.    The British Government has agreed that the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in Franoe should be a French General;   it has agreed that tho Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in the Balkans should be a French General.    I do not see how I could possibly justify&quot; to the.&apos;people of the British Empire that at the moment when the
final attack upon Turkey was to be deliyerdd\, tho command   of Naval Forces which are overwhelmingly British, in -a theatre of war associated with some of the moot desperate and heroic fighting by troops from nearly overy part of the British Brrrj&amp;ire, should be handed over to a French Admiral as well.     I fool sure that you will agree with mo in thinking that no French Government could consent to entrust the command of their farces in similar circumstances to a non-French Admiral and I am, therefore, confident that you trill agree that tho&apos; command of the Naval operations neoessary to complete the downfall of Turkey should,be entrusted to a British Admiral acting under the . general command of the French Commander-in-Chief in tho Mediterranean.Believe me, dear. M. Clemenceau, Yours sincerely,(Signed)    D, LLOYD GEORGE.
