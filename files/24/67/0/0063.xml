returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet for transmission to the Colonial Office when done with miless required for official use.) i rjIjgre^.     From the Governor-General of the Union of South Africa,CAB/-^^nv to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. ^^^J^lceived Colonial Office 10.15.a.m. SOth October, 1918).Ministers state thatAa Conference of wool growers held at &quot;Pretoria on October 16th with object of discussing question of another scheme for the purchase by His Majesty1 s Government of the 1318 ISIS wool clip following resolution amongst others was passed by 37 votes to 23 ? viz: &quot;that the Government of Union of South Africa be asked to approach Imperial Government with a request purchase such portion of the South African-wool clip of the 1918 1919 season as may be registered in a given period on similar terms and price basis as were laid down for the purchase of last seasons clip viz: 1913 1914 average prices plus fifty-five per cent.   In view of the fact however that during the last five years the South. African wool clip has considerably improved in quality it is suggested that price be increased to tenpence per pound in the grease for an average combingof forty per cent clean yfeld and that the Conference is of opinion that as the dif-ference between the Australian and South African-London is not so great to-day as in 1913 1914 this increase in price, is fully justified.    This Conference further re co amends that instead of a share in the profits resulting from.any sales made by the Imperial Government an additional 20 per cent be added to the 55 per cent and be paid out at the tine of purchase in full and final settlement of such purchase.    This Conference consi&amp;Lng of delegates from different districts of the Unionin
3,76in favour of another Government scheme guarantees the regis-tration of 80,000 bales at least and that quantity will  -* doubtless be increased when registration is thrown open&quot;.Owing to an epidemic of influenza raging in South Africa the Confer-ence was not so largely attended as would have been the case under normal co ndi tio ns.    Mi ni sters are grate fu1 for &apos; the consideration which they and the farmers of South Africa re-ceived from His Majesty1 s Government in connection with dis-posal of last years wool clip and would express the hope that His Majesty1 s Government will again cone to the assistance of Union wool growers by purchasing such portion of the 1918 1919 wool clip as may be voluntarily offered within a given period and if so Ministers would be glad to know to what extent His Majesty1 s Government would be prepared to agree to the modifi-cations suggested by Conference.    In the event of His Majesty1s Government agreeing to another scheme of this nature &quot;suggestions will be made later if necessary to the Director of Raw Materials by the Central Wool Committee for alterations in and additions to existing types and re-arrange-ment of the prices for such types in order to remove certain anomalies whofth were found to exist in the working of the scheme last season and to admit of a more fully graduated scale of prices.BUTTON.
