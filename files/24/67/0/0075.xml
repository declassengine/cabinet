(This Document Is the Property of   pfr-^viA.   p^uJl His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governm //9 a 1CuEFIiOTIAL- political mE3mGIi^ce..J)i^abtlemt     fj&apos;jl(21 October, 1918) foreign office,germany/018.&apos; provisional   note; onthe gsrum reply to president vvilson as regards constitutionalchanges in geri.iany. &apos;The German &quot;Government&quot;, in its latest reply to President Wilson, asserts that the Government of Germany has been brought into accord with the will of the people since it has been reconstituted on a. parliamentary oasis by the appointment of leaders of parties in the Reichstag to Secretary-ships of State at the head of the various Imperial Offices.The German Government, in making this assertion,  -seems to reckon upon a widespread ignorance of the terms andvthe operation of the German Imperial Constitution.The Chancellor rnd the Secretaries of State -whether the latter heve seati in Parliament or no - do not constitute &quot;the German Government&apos;.    The&apos;Secretaries of State are not luinisters of the Empire in the constitutional sense.    They are officially ^Secretaries oi State represent-ing-the Imperial Chancellor1&apos;, the sole Imperisl Minister.The sovereignty of the German Ijmpire- resides in the Federal Council over which Prussia, represented by the Chan-cellor, (who is almost invariably President of the Prussian kinistry and is always, as Prussian minister for foreign Affairs, a member of the Prussian ministry), and by the Prussian Delegates,, holds the Presidency.   (Exceptionally Prince Lax of Baden, the new Chancellor, has not been appointed Prussian Minister-President, but he is Prussian kinister xor Foreign Affairs).
The German Emperor represents the sovereignty of the Federal German Governments in various spheres and capacities, vfhich need not here he enumerated.     It is true that he has constantly, by unauthorised and irresponsible speeches, tele- . grams, JJourneys and other arbitrary manifestations, committed the Empire to paths of -policy without first obtaining the consent of the Federated Governments through the Federal Council.It is proposed to place a constitutional cheer: upon these arbitrary interferences by enacting that no public declaration of eny kind shall be made by the Emperor in future without the counter-signature of the Imperial Chancellor, who is to be responsible in all such cases to the Reichstag. -The Imperial Chancellor, with his subordinates, the Secretaries of State, is the organ and spokesman of  he&apos;Federat-ed Governments.    When he addresses the Reichstag he does so expressly &quot;in the name of the Federated Governments&quot;,    Re announces in these terms their attitude towards aiestions of home and foreign policy and their decisions.He does not speak for &quot;the German Imperial Govern-ment&apos;&quot; but always for the &quot;Federated Governments&quot;.The German Liberal Press is trying to make out that a German Imperial &quot;Government&apos;1&apos;, or &quot;Linistry&apos;&apos;, or &quot;Cabinet&quot; -they employ all three terms - has now been constituted, con-sisting of the Imperial Chancellor and the Secretaries of State.     There is no evidence that the prerogatives of the Federal Council have been modified or abolished, or that the centre of constitutional power has been transferred from it to a new &quot;Imperial Government&quot;.    The federal Council constitutes in a $ery real sense the &quot;Government&apos;&apos;, &quot;Cabinet&quot; or &quot;Ministry&quot; of the German Empire and also the Upper House of the Imperial parliament, the Reichstag,
like a Cabinet it initiates legislation and dis-cusses In secret session the drafting of legislative measures and the shaping of policy.    All Government Bills ere approved by it before they are submitted to the Reichstag.    And when the Bills or resolutions&apos;have been passed by the Reichstag, they come before the federal Council, which in secret session discusses them and accepts or rejects them.    when amendments to Government Bills are proposec&quot;. in the Reichstag, the Cbancel-lor, or one of his representatives - a Secretary of State -gets up and says that the Federated Governments (their decision having been conveyed through the Federal Council) will or will not accept the amendment or that they have not yet considered it, as the case may be.  -The delegates to the Federal Council aro not elected by any franchise whatsoever in the different German States. Each Government chooses its delegates without popular or par-liamentary control&apos;.     Indeed,&apos; in several States, they may be said to be appointed by the sovereign, e.g. in Lecklenburg.The Federal Council is thus anything but an assembly representative of the German people.    The federated Sovereigns and Governments whom it does represent form, on the contrary, an authorittpf,which acts secretly and on principles which have not necessarily any popular or democratic basis.It has been truly said of the German Imperial Constitution that, when it was framed, the two existing Con-federations, the United States and Switzerland, were taken as models, but that the models were not followed in respect of the Senate which both these Confederations possess.     Instead of the Senate, a body - the Federal Council - was established, which is not representative in the same sense as they are, and which, in addition to exercising the functions of a Second Chamber, is a seat of Government, a centre of Sovereignty, or
at any rate, an organ of the Sovereignty of the&apos;Federated Governments of the German Empire.This constitutional situation is left untouched by the Reforms which have so far been introduced or promised.It may be further noted that the Imperial Chancellor 1b not a member of the Reichstag, nor does it appear to be con-templated that he or his successors should be.     He is an outsider, appointed by the Emperor, and may be a General, like Caprivi, an official like Bethaiann Hollweg or Lichaelis, a diplomatist like Billow, or a princely personage like prince Cblo&amp;wig Rohenlohe or Prince Max of Baden.    There is nothing except public opinion, the influence of legitimate or ille-gitimate advisers, fear of the Majority in the Reichstag or of public opinion, to prevent the Emperor from appointing any- &quot; one he likes.To take two instances, one of a good Chancellor and the other of a bad one - Caprivi and kichaelis.     Both appoint-ments came as great surprises, not only to the public but to the Reichstag, and even to the leaders of parties.It Is now asserted that under the stress of the present crisis it has been made certain that the Emperor will never again appoint a Chancellor without consulting the views of the Majority leaders.    But there is absolutely no consti-tutiohal guarantee for this.    All depends, and indeed must depend, upon the victory, still problematic, ^of a true con-stitutional spirit.
