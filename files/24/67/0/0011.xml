ISv: - Property of ,.. jvernmeritConfidential.15th October, 1918,CA8%,      &apos;Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office, S.W.1. AUSTRIA/011,MEMORANDUMonTHE PRESENT SITUATION   IN   AUSTRIA.The Czech, Ju^o-Slay, Polish and Ukrainian members of the Vienna Reichsrat are reported to have withdrawn from it into Constituent Assemblies of their own.    If so, there is practi-&apos; oally no one left in it but the German Austrians.    The Austrian Reichsrat has ceased to exist and with it the Austrian covern-ment as such.   .The Austrian Germans see that the olc&quot;. name is up, and*that they will no longer be able to dominate Austria.     They have therefore joined the Austrian-German Socialist::- in the demand for &quot;self-determination for tlie Austrian Germans&quot;. They have passed at least in appearance to the defensive.    The Germans form 37 per cent of the population oi Bohemia and 28 per cent in &quot;Moravia.    If all the German districts are withheld from the new Czecho-Slovalr. State, the most vital strategic and economic interests of that State are jeopardised.    This is the meaning of the new German move in Austria in favour of &quot;self-determination1&apos; .The government has lost all power &amp;r,C, all hold on the situation.    It will admit anything and is in reality steering straight towards civil- war, in which, the Austrian government as such would hardly talfie any part.     It will let the different Constituent Assemblies develop and the different nationalities start an internecine war.     When the Czech Constituent Assembly
meets at Prague, the 2-g million Germans who inhabit the Czech, provinces backed by the Austrian Ger. axis from the central districts will not fail to attempt a counter-strode.     II&apos; the Polish Nation,-.! Assembly at Cracow procls.ii. a union of Galieia with Poland, the Ukrainian Assembly at Lemberg, representing the vast majority of the population of East Galicia and in fact half the population oi Galicia, will answer by a direct declara-tion of war.    Any move of the Ju&amp;o-Slavs at Laibaob and Agram would be countered by the Magyars.    The Vienna government will meantime draw into its shell, and fei^n death or rather the solicitude oi the benevolent peace-maker.But in all probability this political game will last but a very short time.     National questions in Austria are to such an extent bound up with social contrasts that the different national struggles rust unavoidably within the shortest time change into social class warfare.     The struggle of the Ruthenes against the Poles and Magyars, of the Jugo-Slavs against the Germans and Magyars, of the Slovaks and Rumanes against the Magyars are social in their very nature; and even the struggle of the Czechs against the Germans has a very strong social tinge, the biggest landowners in the Czech provinces and by far the greater pant of the industrial capital being German.     But amony the dominant nations also, the Germans, Magyars and Poles, the class struggle is certain to assume a violent form.     This common struggle of the proletariats of the dominant and subject races alike may do something towards mitigating the struggle between the nations, but considering the present moral and material condition of Austria-Hungary, it must within a short time lead to social revolution,which will in certain parts of the Monarchy be no less violent and bitter than in Russia.Everything now depends on the army, i.e. whether the different regiments will march home and carry out their own revolutions, or whether they will let themselves be used in the
-  o -territories&apos; ox other nation&quot; for the suppression or mover tents/ &quot;...to Uiioh their own nationalities are opposed.    The danper ofrepression is, however, less now than it has ever been before considering that the Austrian government is afraid of attempting it because of the impression which this would mahe abroad5 moreover it may be expected that with a view to d is arm in;; the German, Magyar and Polls]&apos; Nationalists the submerged nation-alities will immediately push forward the social question which will secure icr them the support of the revolutionary pro-let ariat among the dominant races,We have no Vienna papers later than October 7th, but even in those papers one can feel the beginning; oX a revolutionary&apos; storm.     The speeohes delivered in Parliament in the first days ox October were no longer of the old debating type.     There was finality in them, and it was obvious that one conviction was common to all the speakers, that Austria as a   State was irretrievably lost.
