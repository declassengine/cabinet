BOARD OF AGRICULIVRE&quot; ANDFOOD PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT,72, Victoria Street,London, S.W, (1).23rd October, 1918.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of thePood Production Department for the week ended 22nd October:-The Weather and^Oonditlon of Crops. Though still unsettled, improved weather was experienced during the post week and permitted of the carrying on of adtumn cultivation, thatching, and the lifting of potatoes, all of whichoperations have been much delayed by inclement weather.Most of the com crops have now been harvested, though tn some districts, especially in the South of Wales, com is still in the field.   Threshings of both wheat and oats, which were stacked before the break in the weather, give very satisfactory results, but those crops which have not yet been harvested are badly damaged.The potato crop is generally good, though somewhatvariable.Roots are being pulled in some districts and give promise of proving a fairly good crop.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION.A considerable number of reports, are reaching the Department that there is great disinclination on the part of farmers to plough up more grass land in the absence of an authori-tative statement from the Cabinet that it Is essential in the national interest to do so, and also that there is a great feeling of insecurity on the part of farmers as to the future of agriculture.
1*1Farmers fear that after- the War, prices of cereals may fall to an V uiireimineratdve level and that the demand of the urban population for cheap food will be so strong that the importance of encouraging homej production will be neglected.   If the results which have beenIobtained during the last two years are not to be lost, it is necessaj that there should be a definite statement of the agricultural polio) of the Government as soon as possible.Further consideration has been given to the draft order, (which was referred to in the report for the week ending the 2nd ins1 requiring farmers to maintain for 1919 the same area of tillage crop as they have grown this yeart   In view of the desirability of avoid the multiplication of.orders and for other reasons it has been dec id not to issue the order, but instead to warn Committees that where there&apos; is a danger that some farmers may lay down to grass some of th( land recently ploughed, a watch is to be kept, and in such cases whe it would be in the interests of food production to do so, the Committees are asked to serve individual cultivation orders.Work of Agricultural Executive Committees. Devon -The Committee were authorised last March to take possession 10 acres of a 63 acre farm at Blackawton which, owing to the ill-heal of the owner-occupier (an elderly woman) was in a very neglected stat the arable land being very foul, the hedges poor and the whole place over-run&quot; by rabbits.   It was hoped by this action that the owner woulf be enabled to manage to better advantage the rest of the farm, but no improvement has taken place, and in the interests of food prcduc-tion the Committee have been authorised to take possession Of the whol of the farm.   In order, however, that hardship to the owner may be avoided it has been suggested to the Committee that they should appoint as their agent to cultivate the, farm a neighbouring farmer w already rentB a part of it, and who would not require the dwelling-house, which could therefore be left in the possession of the owner.
fa faj iIt is considered probable that the Committee will adopt thissuggestion.Prosecutions.   A farmer in Somerset has been fined  80 for non-compliance with a cultivation order served upon him by the Committee.Determination of JTenancj.es.    During the week 5 orders&apos;have been made by the Board determining tenancies on account of. bad farming * in respect of 534 acres.gormcwiBAL pr/isiog.Prov1sion^of handmfor^A11otmenta.    During the week 24 local authorities have agreed to acquire 316 acres of land (4,318 allot-ments), including 46 acres at Manchester, 41 acres at Barnsley, 33 acres at Bedford, and 32 acres at Ashington. Fruit Section.    Fruit plantations in Devonshire, Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely have been inspected, and advice has been given as to improved methods of pruning, spraying, etc.,   Arrangements have been made for the provision of lectures under the auspices of the Horticultural Sub-Committees.    Conferences were held in Devonshire and Somerset with a view to Improving the orchards in those counties.Marketing Section. Shropshire. Conferences have been held in the county with a view to ensuring the efficient working of the County Marketing Society.East Suffolk.    Steps are being taken to ascertain If the Ipswich Industrial Co-operative Society will undertake the work of collecting the surplus produce of the county, and marketing it in Ipswich,TECHNICAL DIVISION. Inspection of Land,     Bromham Farm, Lewes, part of which-was taken over by the Executive Committee last spring, has been inspected in connection with a proposal of the Committee to take possession of the whole of the farm.Supersession of Bessemer Slag by Open Hearth Slag.   A report has been submitted on the results of experiments in improving the
quality oi&quot; the basic slags produced by the open-hearth process. I This process, which in recent years has to a great extent replaced the Bessemer process of steel making, yields slags of lower grade than those hitherto produced.    The report shows that . it may be possible to produce slags of higher grade and more soluble, from iron treated in open-hearth furnaces without interfering with steel production.Electrical Treatment of Seed,     A report has been received of the results of weighings, made on behalf of the Technical Committee, a crops in Dorset grown from seed treated by the Wolfryn electro-chemical process.     In the case of cereals, several of the crops weighed gave fairly substantial increases over the yield of similar untreated plots, and since these trials have had no official supervision and cannot, therefore, be accepted as conclus as to the real improvement or its cause, further investigation of the process is desirable,    A Sub-Committee has been appointed to deal with the subject, and to carry out laboratory tests which wi] form a basis for field trials in the Spring.    Meantime a large-scale experiment with winter wheat is being arranged. Plant Diseases.    A report has been received of a severe outbreak of mildew on wheat, which occurred in Cheshire towards the end of July.    The most extensively grown variety, &quot;Benefactor&quot;, was the most seriously affected.    Most of the worst cases were fields sown late (i.e.l&amp;te December and early January), but late-sown fields of some varieties were hardly attacked at all.     In practically all the most serious cases the wheat had been grown after oats with manure, and had received a dressing either of sulphate of ammonia or superphosphate in spring.     In the worst case, however, wheat followed clover on land heavily manured and prepared for potatoes which were not sown.    The effect In diminished yield in the worst cases was probably not less than 40%, and grain of very inferior quality was then obtained.
*) i 0u    0LABOUR DIVISION. Harvest Labour.   The mtmber of soldiers specially released forj i iipn win in mbi iwirirHiimr -iirrf --^ir&quot;nrir-harvest work and now out on farms is 3,978,    An additional 490soldiers and 380 German prisoners have been sent to Lincolnshirefor the potato harvest.    1,370 prisoners have been allocatedto Yorkshire to assist in raising the potato crop.The Department are in cojitfYiunlcation with the Ministryof National Service,, with a view, to obtaining the assistance ofschoolboy labour for potato lifting in Lincolnshire.Soldier Labour.   The number of soldiers now out on farms,exclusive of the men specially released for harvest work, is63,dll as compared with 62,094 four weeks ago.Danes.   The number of Danish agricultural labourers placed todate is-208 (192 agriculturists and 16 blacksmiths).War Agricultural Volunteers.   The number of War AgriculturalVolunteers placed on farm work to date is 3,738.    Pour weeksago the number was 3,529.Prisoners of War.From 335 agricultural oamps........... .19,583From other camps....................... 1,008Combatant prisoners lodged on  arma^t 1,10021,691Released aliens employed Inagriculture...............

The Department have applied to the War Office for the temporary release of 469 threshing drivers to date, of which applications 25  have so far been granted, and 106 refused.*. 5 **
Women&apos;3 Branch.Training and Employment t   The demand tor yoa&amp;n labour -gtJ.ll excee Jthe supply, and there is an increased demand for women milkers. A number of women trained in this work, who have for some weeks beei drafted to other employment as there were no vacancies for them as milkers, will be withdrawn from any other work on which they are at present employed, as soon as sufficient women are met free from) potato gangs to replace them.A woman thatcher, trained in Essex has recently been employed with much success.An interesting efficiency test was held in West Suffolk last week.   It was the first test of the kind to be held in the county, and was conducted on the form of the Chairman of the Executive Committee.   Tho examination included milking, ploughing root pulling, manure   loading, spraying and thatching.   15 recruit were tested and only one failure in one subject is&quot; reported. : A farm, to be run for the training of women in agricuithas recently&quot; been started in.Essex,  -130 acres will be ploughed immediately.  \ &apos; &apos;.CULTIVATION DIVISION. Tractor Scheme. &apos; The following statement shows the position with regard to the provision of tractors, machinery, and implements forjf the weekended 19th October, 1918:-No. consigned   Total No during week,   with countifTractors ............... (68 withdrawn)     4,223Ploughs ................ 33- . &apos; (2 withdrawn)     5,363During^the week ended 4th October, 19,804 acres were ploughed, 222 acres were cross-ploughed and 2,812 acres, were cultivated.Horse Scheme.   The horse-drawn implements supplied to counties during the past month are as follows:-tNo, consigned Total No. during month,   with countCarts and lorries ..... 13 2,604
Steam Tackle.   The acreage dealt with during tho past week is as follows:- ploughed 12,830 acres, cultivated 7,723 acres, harrowed 550 acres, drained 66 acres rolled 50 acres, total 21,219 acres. Thgjfopply of Coal for ^l^QgM&apos;   Difficulty inobtaining coal has been experienced in several counties, particularly in regard to supplies in quantities loss than a truck load.   The Coal Mines Department havo suggested an amendment of the present scheme by which the local fuel overseers will meot farmers 1 requirements.   The decisions of. the overseers, it is suggested, shall be subject to,appeal to the Agricultural Executive Committees. The details should b.e settled very shortly, but since this scheme forms part of a larger one under the consideration of the Coal Mines Department for the supply of industries using comparatively small quantities of coal, it may be a little time before it is given effect.   In the meantime, local fuel overseers have been instructed to give priority to agricultural demands, and tho present scheme which has certainly eased the situation substantially Will&apos; continue in force.SUPPLIES DIVISION.Fertilisers.   Returns are now available of the production anddeliveries of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate arid ground basicslag for the four months of the fertiliser year ended 30thSeptember.   The figures are as follows?-Production. Deliveries. 4 months June 1st - September&quot; 30th *ii^-Jjl1^-        1^819&quot;. I9l7-I8. &quot;&quot;1918*19.T&quot;6ns                Tons&apos; Tons         &quot;Tons&quot;&quot;Sulphate of ammonia    90;053            96,670 62,915        67,750Superphosphate           115,285           147,362 42,111        65,500Ground Basic Slag      152,438   -       185,693 144,587      177,766It will be seen that in each case the returns for the current seasonare on a higher level than those for the same period last year.Potash.   Sales of potash produced by the British Potash Companyare now proceeding, and about 250 tons have been sold to compoundmanure makers, and 250 tons to Approved Agents.   The demand,however,-up to the present is not very keen.
Stable Manure.   There is a large and Increasing demand for organ.^ stable manure from Army stables and good progress has been made recently in organising its efficient distribution.   In this direction valuable assistance is being rendered by the officers commanding camps in the several Commands, to whom all applications for this manure are now addressed.The distribution of manure from the large dumps at Shirehampton and Swaythling has been placed on a satisfactory footing.   Large quantities continue to be distributed from the Eelmoor dump near Aldershot. Lime.   Considerable numbers of German prisoners have been allocate! to several of the large lime firms in the country, and it is hoped that this will result in an increased production,. Seeds Stored in the United Kingdom yn Foreign Account.   By arrange j ment with the Ministry of Food it is now compulsory for seedsmen t make a return of the quantities of seeds sold to foreign customers which, owing,to export licences having been refused, are being stored in this country.   These returns show that considerable quantities are stored in the United Kingdom under these circumste but the fact that particulars have to be disclosed is believed to checking the practice to an appreciable extent.   The more recent4returns indicate that seedsmen are buying back quantities of thesj seeds for re-sale on the home market.Wart Diseases. The final reports on the inspection of growing cr of immune varieties of potatoes are now being received, and a list; of growers of approved stocks will shortly be available.Further outbreaks of Wart Disease traceable to &quot;seed&quot; supplied from Scotland have been reported. Spraying.   Owing to the continued wet weather and the consequentJL delay in lifting the potato crop, there has been some, but not a I serious, increase in the amount of disease in the tubers, &quot;especial
U o Usi r ain regard to the soft-rots, which are often a sequel to &quot;blight. The increase in the amount of disease is not so&apos; groat as might have been anticipated as the temperature has kept low and has checked to some extent the development of disease.   It is in the west of England that the increase in the amount of disease in the crop has developed, but in the large potato growing areas of the fens no serious reports of increase in disease have been received.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon.Rowland E. Prothero,M.P.,President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
