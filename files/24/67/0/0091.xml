(THIS JDOQUMBNg la TO VlftOrERTY Off HIa BRITANNIC iftJLolPY&apos; 3 GOVESNIjag).G0T,-6091cV/j\ R........Q A BINE T;A NOTE ON THE EARLY CONCLUSION Off IEAGE, ( By Genoral Smuts),6 til ui?or the &apos;King and War Cabinet only6The moment is approo decisions will have to be order to focus attention difficult and fateful ofaching when the moiaspect of the great peace quo; I wish to put the case for an to my mind,far-reaching taken, and I write this note in on what seems to me to be the most In order that no importantit ion should be early peace aslo ft uncons idere d j it presents itselfThere is a very noticeable wave of public opinion in favour of prolonging the war until a crushing defeat has been inflicted on Germany, and with this opinion the Government must naturally reckono   At the same time my experience of affairs has been that tho groat issues are often quite different from those to which tho public for the moment attach most importance.     And where so much is at stake, but for the British Empire and the world at larges those on whom fate has laid the burden of leadership are bound to look beneath the surface of the public opinion of the moment, and to explore the whole ground with the most circumspect judgments     To this consideration we are also* called by the very sober statement which bir Douglas Haig made to the 0abj.net on the 19th October, and which inspires no extrkva-gant hopes for the immediate future from purely military effort on the Western Pronto     I would put tho case for an early peace as follows1* There can be no.doubt, and there is no enemies have lost the war., They havo been and are everywhere suing for peace &amp;. Their whore retreating or suffering a worse fate, are broken by a spirit of revolution or dis future :7or .all of them is as dark and dospe She victory which we set out to achieve has substantial respects^doubt, that our decisively beaten armies aro every-their home fronts solution, and the rate as it could be been won in all2o     The salient fact to remember is that, as matters -now stand, this great result has boon achieved largely&quot; by the&quot; unexamplod&quot;*war effort of the British Empiree     On land and sea and in the air the great turn of the tide of war in the summer and autumn of this year has been due to the&apos; supreme British effort.     If peace comes nowv it will bo a British peace, it will be a peace givento the world by the same Empire that settled the Napoleonic wars a century ago,.     We have moved forward slowly, but now at the supreme crisis of the war we aro at the height of our- power; on land and sea and in the air we have tho most prodigious forces of all the allies; tho groat knock-out blow to the German power on the Western front has just been administered by use    If wo are wise andtako careful thought of our present achievements and our future position in the world we shall choose this moment to make peace, which will in that case be looked upon in history as our peace, our gift to.the world and humanityc    If unwisely wo let slip this opportunity, the war may drag on for another year - till no doubt Germany is utterly broken and finished, but also (and this is my point) till we have lost the first position; and tho peace which will then be imposed on an utterly exhausted Europo will be an American peace,     In another year
0*&quot;     g)    &quot;MOf war the United states will havo taken our place aa the first military, diplomatic ana financial power of the world.   She will have the largest armies, as already she has the greatest financial and industrial resources, vhe will h.ve the largest mercantile marine,  and she will be the dipl-mati? dictator of the world. A new centre cf gravity will havo been given to the great system Of Western civilisation, with results for the world and the British Empire which no man can foresee. - From the point of view of the British Empire,  therefore, this would be the proper time to conclude the war, if it is possible to do go on satisfactory terms.   How does the question stand from the general European point of view ?3.   There is no doubt that under the pressure of this vast world war a fundamental change is coming over the spirit of Europe.   Its tremendous and far-reaching pressure is felt even more on the home fronts than on the battle fronts-   Hence nations   ( and states go to pieces under this awful pressure before their armies are finally bdaten on the field of battle.   This was the case with Russia, in a minor degree it seems to have been tho case with Bulgaria, and now the same thing is happening in Austria, whose army remains unbeaten on the Italian front while the organism of the State is dissolving behind.   Under this pressure new forces are boing liberated, and a new spirit is being created which is destructive to all the ideas on which an orderly European oivili-sation has been slowly built up.   Autocraoy, which - was the danger yesterday-,  is already dead  ;r dyinj in the hearts of the nations, while to-day the grim spectre of Bolshevist anarchy is stalking to the front.   In another year of warfare this subterranean ferment may have assumed the most menacing social and political forms in Europe.   There is serious danger that the bad, but mere   . or less orderly, political pre-war system of Europe may give place to a wild disorder of jarring and warring state fragments, such a3 we new see on a vast scale in Russia-,   The fact is that the organism cf civilisation can no longer stand the strain put upon it, and is slowly but surely tending tc break up-.   In the Balkans before the war we had a foretaste cf the consequences of such a state of affairs. - \Rhat is going tc happen when, as now seems probable,  Austria breaks up and becomes a &quot;Balkans1 on a vaster scale ?   With the creation of an &quot;independent&quot; Poland,  there will be a chain of&apos; these discordant fragments right across Europe from Finland in the Nirth tc Turkey in the South,   No League cf Nations could hope to prevent a wild war-dance cf those so*qailed free nations in future.   The disorders of the new time may well be such that peaceable people will pray for the return cf the firm hand of autocracy, and. the Reaction may once mere lay its heavy hand cn Europe.   Germany may easily become the policeman of this chaotic Europe, as she already is in Finland and the ether border states carved from Russia.   And the danger is that she may gradu-ally come to dominate this hotrogeneeus mass until in another generation or two her foot is once mere planted on the neck cf Central Europe.   Whether any League of Nations will be strong enough to preserve Europe from this fate the future alone can shew.4.   It would, be vain to hope that the evil effects of such developments would be confined to continental Europe.   The Balkan imbroglio was the direct cause cf this world-war, and in the same way the political disintegration of Oentral Europe must inevitably have the most tremendous repercussion over the whole world.   I do not now refer to the colossal war debts piling up, the blood tribute in millions of casualties annually,  the stop-page of industry, and the wastage of capital.   To all these and much more we have become hardened.    I refer only to broad tendencies.
,nn&apos; from this point of view thord Sun bo no question th t -..n parly satisfactory termination of tho war in oi tho most vital interest to Luropo and the world at largo, and it would be wrong, merely for thu a. ke of still further and more adcquutoly punidh-ing Germany for hor misdeeds, to continue tho war and thereby to inflict incur bio wounds on tho body politic of toopo..     .yhon Christian nations war urnon;. each other, they are bound to boar in mind the overmastering claims of their slowly built uo Christ-ian civilisation itself,&apos;Now that the Germans are tho row hi;; bo ton, tho greatest noed of Europe is an early peace and a chance oi recovery from the political diseases to which sho is fast becoming a orqy. The war favor at this lato hoar bOginnlnr to rage in America, the insensate spirit oi revenge now apparently actuating franco, the temporary and evanescent Chauvinism in this country which has followed as a reaction on the pessimism of our Sorinr retreat-all, these should not blind us to the real inwardness oi the Situation,The popular cry for justice is very insistent, but two governing considerations should be kept steadily in view. Firstly, the evil oi continuing the war is raei&amp;ly beginning to outweigh the good to be achieved b;; a more complete measure of victory or justice.     Secondly, the British Empire should not pursue justice at the expense of its own legitimate future, After all we have to bo.,r in mind that our opponents at the peace tablo will not only bo our enemies;   and the weaker we become through the exhaustion of war, the more insistent may be the . demands presented to us to forego what we considoj necessary forI our future security.     And history teaches that our friends of to-di may not be our friends of to-morrow,5, As far as the British empire is concerned we have&apos;oracti-cally won and hold all that we want for our future cOmeloto mastery of the seas and access to raw materials, security oi our communications through possession of the German Colonies, and protection of our routes to Asia through the secure possession of Egypt, Arabia, Palestine and Kesopotamia,     To these wo must / hold as grimly as possible, and in any case no surrender should be made to present or future potential enemiese     Beyond these we.must secure the evacuation and restoration of the occupied territories of our Allies, as well as the evacuation oi Alsace-Lorraine whose ultimate fate must depend on self-determination in some form or another,.the cession to Italy of Trentino and certain other territories, the complete autonomy of Bohemia in afederal nr confederate Austria (unless Austria breaks up earlier), the complete self-determination of. Jufo-Sl&amp;via, and the indo-pendoneo of Poland with access to thu sea0     This programme,. together with the revision 01 .tho Br jst and Bucharest treaties,- . the establishment of a LoaMia of Nations, and the limitation oi  -armaments, I have no doubt we could make or force the Central Powers to accept j and we could conclude peujo on tht,t basis this winter.-     It is a moderate programme which might not satisfy the extremists, but it would embody all that is really essential in our war aims.     And the two thousand million pounds which we&apos; should save by ending the war this instead oi next winter could be well spent&apos; in Empire development and social reconstruction afic the rest \/o- must le. ve to the future, and. the 16ague oi Nations., and the unconquerable Spirit of man,     The burdens wo have shouldered in this generation have been he vy enough.(Initialled)    JiC^,24th October, 1918i
