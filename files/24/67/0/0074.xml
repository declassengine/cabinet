Tilin DOCUiiilT IS THE PROIIKTY Off HIS BKITAI^IC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNEHT.)S EC R E T.WAR   CABINS T.(VT.-6C74.NOTE ON A GENERAL ARMISTICE.(By General J.C. Smuts.)I wish to jot down a few observations on the present armistice discussians and negotiations.   Both of these are of paramount importance whether from the point of view of the termination or the continuance of the war.The broad effect on the public mind of president &quot;Wilson&apos;s correspondence with Germany, Austria and Turkey is that peace negotiations have begun, and as this correspondence drags on the effect on an exhausted world must be to create an irresist-ible peace atmosphere and to make the continuance of the ^ar impossible for us.   Unless we feel certain that the war is really over, and that nothing no?; remains but for the diplomats to discuss and sign the peace treaties, this correspondence may really prove a disastrous handicap tc us in renewing the campaign next year.   It should be ended as soon as possible, if it is not already too late.Rot only does this correspondence create a dominant peace . atmosphere, but it deals more with the side Issues than the grim realities of the peace settlement,   It is unprofitable at this tine of day to argue with the Germans on the exact measure of military predominance which the Allies have secured, or the German crimes on sea and land, or the Kaiser&apos;-s position under the German constitution.   These are not the things which matter, and an air of unreality is created in this correspondence which is more and more becoming a dialectic display rather than a sober statement of what we really want.   It does not deal with peace terms, nor even with the terms of a general armistice, but with certain issues r-relirainary to both which President uilson has raised on his own account.   I feel this correspondence has started us cn a wrong road, and it is of the greatest importance to us to get to the right road as soon as possible and before we have wandered too far in this dialectic maze.   The question is how to get out of this correspondence which may prove seriously embarrassing, if not compromising, to Allied interests.There is another and even stronger reason for reconsidering our course.   The enemy has asked for peace and an armistice, and while president Wilson is conducting his correspondence with the enemy, the Allies hove been discussing the terms of a General Armistice among themselves.   This discussion has revealed - what some have felt all along - that in a war like this an armistice is almost out of the question, for if it is to be effective from our point of view and not merely to give a breathing space to the enemy it must be so severe as really to&apos; prejudge and anticipate the final settlement of peace,The result of those discussions on an armistice is that the various drafts before us differ in no material respect from -an unconditional surrender, which is not justified by the present relative military positions of the belligerents.   Pooh demands the evacuation of occupied territories and even of enemy terri-tories up to the Rhine, with substantial bridgeheads over the Rhine; he also demands thrt all personnel and material whichcannot be evacuated, in an impossibly short time must be disarmedand surrendered. The Military representatives in their recom-mendations go further and ask for the disarmament of the enemy
foroaa and other 9onditiens which only an utterly defeated enemy oould be aompalled to oonotde.   Italy asks for the maximum of her territorial claims, while our Admiralty advises us that not only Heligoland &quot;but the major porti n of the German High Bean fleet as well as all her submarines must be surrendered,   It seems to me utterly useless to go to an armistice conference&apos; with Germany in order to present to her suph&apos; demands,   Such an amis-tice would be far m k- difficult t: ooncludo than a general peace cither on wils&apos;o.n*s or tho prime Minister&apos;s programme.It would obviously be safer far Germany to concede our whole war aims programme than to submit- without crushing and final defeat on the field of battle to an armistice so humiliating and wounding to the hon ur of her army and navy,  the valour and achievements , 9f which are beyond question.An armistice conference between the military loaders on those lines is, therefore, bound t-- pr ive abortive *   That will be mischievous enough after the peace atmosphere which has already been created.-,   But unfortunately the mischief will net stop there..   The repercussion &amp;f our exorbitant armistice terms will be very great all .;;vcr the world v   Compared with the studied moderation of our peace pr grammes as published last Jaaftary,  our armistice demands will come as a great shock not only to neutral publio opinion but also to that groat public of moderate and reasonable -men who form the greatest political reserve in this as in all Allied countries *   It will be - said that the Germans were prepared to concede V/ilsorJs 14 points and to evacuate all Allied territories, and that a fair and satis-factory peace oould have been concluded, but that it has been rendered &quot;impossible by our unreasonable attitude.   It &quot;would be said that the Chauvinists-have taken charge   -f the peace negjtia-ti-.ns.   The result might well be most regrettable if not disastr us f ;r the rcoral  .f the Allied nations.   And on the -other side the enemy moral would be o -rreepondingly improved by what will be held up to the German people as a complete exposure of our will t   humiliate, dismember and destroy Germany.   In the great defensive campaign   f next year Germany would start with a great moral reoevery, while we would labour under a corresponding handicap,   And in the background&apos;there is always the danger of a serious division -jf opinion am ng the Allies as t;, who is responsible far the unnecessary continuance of the war.The question arises why we should run all this risk at this stage before the actual peace discussion begins.   All this trouble would be raised ever the question of an Armistice which in any case is perhape^feasible, and which should-, therefore, be avoided by us, if possible, even at this late h ur.It may also bo pointed cut that the Germans would shrink from entering into a humiliating armistice because of their dread of the still harder terms which might be imposed  .n them at the peace when n? means  if resistance would be left them any more,For ail the reasons mentioned I see more prospects of success in concluding peace than iriconcluding an armistice.   The prime Minister&apos;s peace programme of the 5th January could be more easily oarried out than Foch&apos;s or tho Versailles armistice programme Wc should theref -re conclude the war with ut arranging an armis-tioe, as was, I.believe, the case in the Russo-Japanese war.   or if an armistice is deemed t   be necessary,  we should not conclude it until definite preliminary peace terms have been signed, and b )th we and the enemy knew exactly where we are.
I would, therefore, suggest that when President Wilson sends the German application for peace and an armistice forward to us, we should answer that we see very grave difficulties about an armistice until preliminary articles of peace have been agreed upon, end that without a cessation of hostilities we ore prepared to discuss our essential peace terms, while leaving the details of the general peace settlement to be arranged at a final Peace Conference.In order to carry out this programme, 1 consider it necessary that England., France and Italy and the U.S.A. should forthwith agree to a definite statement of the terms which should be laid before the enemy at such a conference.   President Wilsons 14 points have been accepted, but they are so vague and general, and even ambiguous, that it would be necessary for the above parties to go through them and to substitute for them definite proposi-   , tions which could be signed as preliminary articles of peace. Some of the 14 points raise matters which either wholly or in detail could only be dealt with at the general peace.   Thus, for example, the details of the settlement of Poland, the Balkans, and the Austrian nationalities could only be dealt with at the final Peace Conference;   but the renunciation by Germany of her colonies and Alsace-Lorraine, and by Turkey of her conquered provinces, could be definitely effected in the preliminary articles.    It must be for the Allies to determine what could stand over and what must now be $efiniiely  settled in the preliminary articles.   And their terms.must be agreed upon as definite and final and not subject to be whittled away by the arguments of the enemy. Germany must be presented with our bedrock term3, ?diich In essence should be unalterable - presented for acceptance or rejection. And this definition of our programme could be settled at the next Versailles Conference, where for the first time America will be represented. (- If we do not want peace now but to continue the war In order tp gain a more decisive military superiority next year, the armistice negotiations would do as a means to come to a break with this peace discussion.   But if we mean to attain to an early and satisfactory peace, I see more prospect of success in the above programme than in the present armistice negotiations.If on considerations it is found impossible at this late stage to withdraw from the present armistice negotiations, and these end (as anticipated) in failure, it is still possible that the enemy may be driven this winter to renew peace overtures. In that case, I would very strongly urge that no further attempt to conclude an armistice be made&apos;, but that the peace discussion proper be forthwith proceeded with.   For this purpose a clear agreement on our fundamental peace aims would be necessary, and I therefore press that no time be lost by the Allies and America in arriving as soon as possible at a definite settlement of their programme for presentation to the enemy when the proper time arrives.   The situation on the battle fronts, and still nuarjet in&apos;Central Europe, shows that the end of the war is in sight, and it is necessary that we loose no further time in putting our peace programme in order.(Intd.)
