The outbreak in Devon and Cornwall unfortunately continues to spread.     12 more cases have been confirmed, bringing the total up to the end of the week to 39.     On the 16th instant the Cornwall and Devon (Control of Dogs) Order of 1918 (Ho. 6) was made by the Board, superseding and revoking all the previous Orders,     This Order prescribed the compulsory muzzling of all dogs with a wire cage muzzle, after the 24th instant, in an Area extending from Grampound in Cornwall on the west, to tho River Avon in Devonshire on the east, and northwards from Plymouth to a distance of about 10 miles.     The Order further prescribed the muzzling, with a wire or leather muzzle as from the 15th November, of all dogs in an Area surrounding the district above mentioned, including the remainder of Cornwall and a large part of Devonshire.     In the last mentioned Area, dogs are required to be led by a person with a collar and chain, or other attachment, until the date when the compulsory muzzling takes effect.The movement of dogs out of Devon and Cornwall and also out of the inner Area surrounding Plymouth and Fowey, continues to be prohibited except with a licence of the Board, requiring quarantine on approved Veterinary premises for four months.     The Board&apos;s principal difficulty in imposing the muzzling restrictions over a wide area has been the scarcity of muzzles.    Manufacturers are disinclined to enlarge their output, whilst other more remunerative war work is in hand.     The Board have therefore approached the Treasury with a view to enable them to place orders for muzzles and to guarantee manufacturers against loss in this connect!on *-Foot and Mouth Disease .    Ho further outbreak has been confirmed, and the restrictions on the movement and the marketing of animals in East Sussex has still further been modified.Swine Fever.

Arrangements have been made with regard to the selection analysis and lifting of the sugar beet crop grown for seed.Advantage has been taken of the early dry weather and all the heavy land has been sown first.    The cropping position is, therefore, quite secure, the remainder of the land to be sown being mainly light land which will take any quantity cf rain without ill effect.    120 acres have still to be sown with wheat:   86 acr^s of Winter tats have been sown.*The balance of the arable land to be dealt with in the spring will consist of a small portion of roots after barley, and 150 acres of sugar beet seed:    tho remainder which is very foul will be devoted to fallow crops.Arrangements are being made for manuring.     The land is very badly in need of Lime and Phosphates and the lighter land ie also sadly deficient in Potash.    It is essential to get as much artificial manure sown as possible.The Livestock is doing well apart from Foot-rot:   20 mixed head of cattle have been purchased and further purchases are being made *Tithe, Commons, Copyhold and Survey Branch.notwithstanding that the Tithe Bill, which holds out prospects for the redemption of tithe rentcharge for a smaller consideration than that possible under the existing legislation, has now passed its Second Reading, applications for voluntary redemption on the present terms continue to be received at a rate which exceeds that for many years past, the number of new applications made during the past week being seven.

In the opinion of the Joint Committee, the action taken by tho Ministry of Food, both with regard to feeding stuffs and fat stock, is likely to disarm most of tho criticisms met with in th^se letters.     The Committee have issued a Notice to farmers, prepared in agreement by the Ministry of Food and the Board of Agriculture, stating inter alia what a farmer can do with tail and damaged corn unfit for human food, how he can use it for his o.*v.;. own stock feeding, if ho can got a licence for so doing, or soil it at not more than the fixed maximum for damaged grain, or if undamaged, at the maximum price.   The notice also tells the farmor that ho may food a reasonable quantity of oats in the straw subject to the orders of Ministry of Food or Army Council.On Saturday last, the Joint Committee initiated a now departure in the distribution of thoir literature by the opening of a stand in tho Corn Exchange at Norwich.
