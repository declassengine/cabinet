COMFIDMTIAL.Political Intelligence Department,Oct. 17th, 1918.Foreign Office,France 00/5SopM E Ivi 0 R A&apos; N D U MonTHE FRENCH SOCIALIST CONGRESS AND AJTER.In a Memorandum written on August 22nd it was pointed out that events seemed to he tending more and more to a split between the two wings of the French Socialist party.     In fact, it was said &quot;the split has begun. .&apos;. It is difficult to prophecy how it will develop.    The next stage is the meeting of the National Congress of the whole party in which the ultimate sovereignty, as it were, resides.&quot;The Congress has now met.     The efforts of Centrists like Sembat and Blum failed altogether to secure unity, and after co-operating in an address to President \7ilson the two sections came, it may almost be said^ to Open blows.     35ven the address to Lir.&apos; Wilson, the work of a small Committee in which each was represented, met With some damaging criticism from the stalwarts of both.     In particular Kilhaud from the Right objected to the words which&apos;described the proposals of the Central Powers as &quot;a serious opening of negotiations&quot;: and one of the other side complained that the Address did not say enough about the &quot;international action of the proletariat. But the truth is that it was a rather colourless document containing nothing of much interest except a scaroaly veiled reproof of the President&apos;s previous reply at half an hour&apos;s notice (&quot;the party considers that, while requiring the neces-sary diplomatic and military guarantees, the allied Govern^ ments are urgently bound not to repel such a proposal without
discussion.w.)    It wae carried with three dissentients. And the official organ of the party rejoined that the Con-greas had begun with an aot of unity. .But iext day it became clear that the unity was super-ficial and shortlived.    The struggle began.    It was evident that it wae at once a struggle for power and a clash ef principles.    The old Minority, whom it may be convenient to call the Internationalists, desired to complete the victory they had obtained at the Ceunoil in July, to Capture the maohine of the party and to transform its official policy in the direction of Pacifism and International Bolshevism.    And this is in fact what they hate d&amp;ne.    The majorities were not large &quot;but they were sufficient.    The first Was only 25: the eeccndi which decided the issue between the two fcalitioal resolutions put forward by each section was 316 (1528 for the International or Lenguet section with whom the extreme Kienthalians voted:   1212 fsr the National or Thomas and Renaudel section, and 181 for the Centrists):   and finally the third majority for the transfer of the editorship of the official Humanitl frum Renaudel to Caohin, was 155*.    This is a reversal of the situation at the Congress of a year ago when the Right showed themaleves strong enough to have defeated the Eeity; even if the Left had had the support cf the Centre.    But though the-Internationals have plainly wen a decided victory, there are two curious facts disclosed ]jy. the figures.    One is that though they for the first time capture the Congress their majority is smaller than it was at the National Council In July, and that if the Centrists oppeee them it is very email indeed.    Then they obtained 1544 votes agaiiaat 1172, a majority of 372.    This may be explained by the effect of victory on the members of the
Centre who on that occasion seem mainly to have supported Longuet.    A thing more difficult to explain is that in the largest and most extreme of the Socialist Federations, that of the Seine, Longuet and his Kienthalian allies obtained 9 out of the 12 delegates to the Council in February, and 10 out of-15 in July:   while for the Congress they obtained 30 out of 46, which appears to be a progressive though not rapid reduction.There is not a great deal that needs saying about therival resolutions.    Longuet&apos;s, the victorious one, demands thedisappearance of capitalist society, declares that the partyremains ready to play its part in national defence (solidairede la Defense nationale) but denounces  $he blunders of theHigh Command and the Imperialism of the Government:   rejectsany collaboration with the non-Socialist parties and denouncesthe &apos;union Sacree&quot;;   declares that the party is ready for anInternational Conference at once:   (no conditions are mentioned:-)quotes the English Trades Union Congress resolution aboutpassports and says the party should use all means., includingthe refusal of credits, to obtain them:   strongly condemnsAllied intervention in Russia: says the party will support, at v.the peace settlement, all national claims &quot;so far as they are1legitimate and realisable at this moment1&apos; but opposes all programmes that would prolong the wai*; and declares that no satisfactory peace .$an follow on a war waged on. both sides&apos; by capitalist and imperialist states:   supports the establishment of a Society of Nations tub refuses to make it a war-aim.
It is obvious that the tendency of the whole document is international, pacifist and revolutionary.    Ho word is said in condemnation oi the German Government, much less of, the German Socialists:   AllieO Intervention in Russia is denounced but nothing is said oi the T ;rty of Brest:   what is desired is apparently an International Conference without any conditions and a peace which would be,es indeed one of the new majority has openly confessed, peace without victory,The defeated resolution of the National Party was not a very strong document but it adopted a more cordial attitude towards national defence, rejected the idea of voting against war-credits except under very extreme circumstances* adopted kr. Wilson1b 14 points;   demanded that $eace should bring guaran-tees of reparation of the damage done in the war;   followed the recent Inter-Allied Socialist Conference of London in demanding Labour representation at the Peaoe Congress, as well as in its attitude about intervention in Russia, which that Conference ; did not condemn, and about an International Conference as to which it laid down conditions.In one sense this Resolution is more international than LonguetVsv    It cares much more ?bout the interest of  -foreign peoples as is seen in its acceptance of the fourteen points.    That, of Longuet cares nothing for the future- of Russia, Poland or Serbia as nations.    Its internationalism is not inspired by sympathy for all nations, but by sympathy for a single class..    It is^ in fact, an internationalism which ignores nations, as opposed to that a  kr. Wilson which alms at uniting them in a Society of which each will be an indepen-dent member.    The question.is what the victory of this revo-lutionary internationalism in the French bocialist Party means,, and what importance it has.
\Its meaning is that the party, bo far as the new majority, which is not a majority of tbe-$o^U4^^ control it, has gone over to pacifism.     Indeed one&apos;may almost say,..to Germanism;   for Longuet and hie friends never say a word against Gapm&amp;h Grimes of any kind, diplomatic or military, and reserve all their attacks for the alleged Imperialism of the Alliesi     In vain in the debate did Renaudel quote to Longuet his former speeches in which he declared that it. was necessary to make an end once and for all of Prussian militarism and described an International Conference as useless and impossible. He has forgotten all that.    He now wants a Conference and peace and both at once, the Conference without conditions and peace at any price..    In his speech at the Congress he accused Thomas of sacrificing Frenchmen for the sake of certain nationalities.] He always defends the Bolshevists and is quite ready to leave Russia to the joint tender mercies of Bolshevists and Germans. He denounces Thomas and his section for supporting the Czecho-Slovaks.    Ri: ... up sorter, Cachin, the new editor of Human its&quot;, openly attacked the dismemberment of Austria and aclopted the view - which in any one else he would have called a reversion to the policy of the balance of power and the Congress of-Vienna that Austria was needed as a counterpoise against Germany.    He was also very critical of the operations in:Syria.    And Longuet supporter, Mayeras, is reported to have attacked British Imperialism at recent meetings of strikers (at which by the way, the men themselves took up a patriotic attitude as regards doing urgently neoessary war work). ;The meaning then, of Longuet!s victory is plain. So far as he can control the party it will use its influence in a way which, whatever saving phrases be used, will Ua practice work for a German peace:.and will tend rather to renewing the old friendship with the German disciples of his grandfather,
Marx, than to concentrating the now one, for which he has no love, with American and English Labour-men, who sent him home defeated and angry from the London Conference of Inter-Allied Socialists in September.    They are not Socialists in his sense; that is they are not men of a book, of an abstract creed, of a single idea.    And they are resolved upon a complete victory ..in the war and say so with great frankness, as in a message English Socialists sent to this Congress.    The result is that Longuet declares that he will never attend another such Liter-Allied Conference and, by a majority of one on the Committee, cancelled the invitation for the Congress sent to the Italian Reformist Socialist! who are patriotic and took part in the London meeting, and sent one to the Unified Socialists who did all they could to prevent Italy coming into the war and have always had suspicious relations with Gorman and Austrian finance.It must be recognised then, that; so far as^it goes, the change in the French Socialist Party is a set back to the whole cause which depends upon the unity of the Allies and the will to complete victory.     But bow far does it goeand what is its importance?The party machine has been captured;   that is clear. Its official voices, the Kumanite and the Committee, will be under semi-Pacifist and semi-Bolshevist control.    But in the Chamber the majority of Socialist deputies is the other v/ay and it remains to be seen whether they will be affected by the change in the majority of the Congress.     It is not even certain how far the-new majority will find it prudent to use their victory.    They are not of the temperament that thinks much of prudence or is conscious of environment or of any opinion but its own.   If they had been they would not have chosen the present moment, when all Prance is breatlless with the prospect of victory, and the names of Poch and Clemenceau are in every
