Colonel I. Dally km,^ (This DocHr^ent is thtfi Pronerty 6 6 iu&quot;His tjr^-;/.......I&apos;&quot;7^7&quot;-^^i7tlWORTS &amp; iilXFOlYTG (TiaMPOR/lHY CONTROL) BILL.UoJ  Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.With a view to securing powor to continue to exercise control over imports into    1 exports from the United Kingdom for a limited period after the war. I propose to take an early opportunity of re-introducing, with some very slight odiiications to which 1 refer below, the Imports and ikport,s Temporary Control) Bill which was introduced but not carried o a second reading last session.The powers under which the importation and exportation of any goods can be prohibited except under licence are for the most part conferred by War legislation and would there-fore expire automatically when the war terminates.  There is little doubt that it will be possible to relax tho existing restrictions on trade to a very considerable extent when the war is over, when the oxisting war demands for certain materials c^aae, and when the tonnage situation will certainly admit of greater freedom for the carrying on of ordinary trade operations.   It is, however, essential that in regard both to imports and to exports His Majesty!s (tovernment should not find themselves unable to control in any way the class of goods which should be imported and exported.How long it may be necessary to exercise this control it is impossible to predict.   The Bill proposes a period of 3 veers after the termination of the War. that is to say after the &quot;ratification of the Treaty of reace.  A number of correspondents have written to the Board of Trade and a number of deputations have been received here with regard to this measure.  Although there is not absolute unanimity on tho subject there is no doubt a considerable volume of opinion which views with alarm the prospect of any Government Department being entrusted for so long with powers which might be exercised arbitrarily ovor the import and export trade of the country.  There is of course a considerable difference between the retention of the power to control and the actual exercise of that control and though 1 think it most improb-able that it will be necessary to maintain control except over a comparatively small number of articles for so long, I cannot uut feel some hesitation about asking Parliament for powers for a period which in some respects may prove insufficient.  On the whole, therefore, Fhave decided to retain, the 3 year period though it may be found necessary to modify it in the House.The Bill in its present shape though essentially the same as that introduced previously differs from it in three minor respects.(l) Words have been introduced to make it clear that it is imports into and exports from the Unitod Kingdom only which it seeks to control.  This should have been obvious but I find that there was an impression abroad that under the Bill United Kingdom firms could have been prevented from engaging in the trade between one foreign country and another.   There was of course no such intention.
(Z)  It has also been made clear that after the end of the war the solo authority whether for imposing or revoking prohibitions or for issuing liconce3 there-under is to do tho Board of Trade.  At* present whilst licences for the importation of prohibited goods are issued by the Board of Traclo and tho whole administration of the licensing is in their hands, licences for the exportation of prohibited joods aro issued in the name of tho Lords or tho Council, the administration being in fact exorcised by the war Trade iiopartment.   This latter Department in exercising its functions during tho war is of course guided to a large extent by blockade oonsidera-tions and has neoessarily^to follow directions given to it by the Ministry of Blockade,  Vlhen the war ends and the olockade is over there is no reason why the administra-tion of export prohibitions like that of import prohibition should not&apos; be brought under the Board of Trade. Very considerable importance is attached by traders to there being1 one sole responsible Department to which they can appeal, and i feel&quot;sure that a definite indication in the Bill that the whole administration is to be brought under one single head will create general satisfaction.   It is not of course proposed that the transfer of the ftar Trade Department to the&apos;Board of Trade shall take effect at once. Such a transfer would, probably be inconvenient so long as tho war continues.        ttf?.s reason tho Bill does not seek to revoke the existing war legislation under which new prohibitions are made,   This legislation will however cease automatically to- have effect when the war comes to an end and the sole r%ht to prohibit imports or exports or to issue licences will then rest by the Bill in the Board of Trade.(3) A new clause lias bo en added to tho Bill requiring tho Board of Trade to set up a Committee or Committees containing representatives of manufacturers and traders. It was always my intention to consult such representatives in administering the Act, but I have been rcpoatedly pressed, to include a definite provision in the Bill providing for such consultation, and&quot; I see no reason against meeting this widespread wish,   1 think it right however to make it clear that I have no intention of allowing any persons engaged in trade or manufacture to have a vsice in the decision as to the actual grant of particular licences. Any suggestion that individuals wore placed in such a position&quot;that they could make use of it to benefit particular interests would give rise to suspicions of favouritism which it is essential to avoid.   The assignee to which I look from manufacturers and traders relates rather to advice respecting such general, questions as the existence and extent of any particular shortage and as to the quantities of goods of particular descriptions which can safely be allowed to be exported having regard to home and allied requirements and so on.AX STANLiiY.Board of Trado23rd October, 1918.
Imports and Exports (Temporary Control) Bill.MEMORANDUM.The practical effect of the present Bill is to simplify and continue for a period of three years after the termination of the present war the powers which His Majesty has exercised during the war as regards the control of imports and exports. Other-wise these powers would to a great extent lapse as soon as a state of war ceases to exist.The present powers of prohibiting the importation and exportation of goods are as follows: (1) Under section 43 of the Customs Consolidation Act there is power by Proclamation or Order in Council to prohibit the importation of any goods, but not to prohibit the importation of goods of any specified origin.(2) Under section 8 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1879, there is power to prohibit absolutely the exportation of certain specified goods (arms, &amp;c, and food), and this power has been extended by the Customs (Exportation Prohibition) Act, 1914, to all goods of any description, but the extension has effect only while a state of war exists.(3) Under the Exportation of Arms Act, 1900, there is power (when for specific reasons it is deemed expedient) to prohibit the exportation of arms, &amp;c, to any country or place named in the order, and this power has been extended while a state of war exists.(a) to the exportation of all goods of any description, by the Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1914; and(b) to the exportation of goods to any such country or place unless consigned to particular individuals, by the Customs (Exportation Restriction) Act, 1915.The restriction of imports and exports is in practice subject in all cases to any licence which may be granted to import or export.38-2 a
The extensions of the law above referred to has effect only whilst a state of war exists. The result is that immediately the war terminates there will be no power (1) to prohibit importation of goods of a particular origin; or (2) to prohibit exportation except in the case of certain specified classes of goods; and most of the Proclamations and Orders relating to exports which hare been made during the war, under the above-mentioned Acts, will cease to have effect.
