Docttrnti&apos;&quot;        - Property Qf--T 18th ftgtobor.191b.His Brltan ic M &apos; stv&apos;o &quot;Government             .......REOJJIREMBHTS 0F&quot;TH3N F3R THE&apos; MAlTOdm^ADMIRALTY SUPPLIESQ / ;/ fl^Ut i K^0^&amp;-^w^1Joy Memorandum for the W&amp;r Cabinet,Hie Admiralty desire to bring before tho War&apos;Cabinet certain oonssauencea which have followed upon the withdrawal of men from Admiralty Workshops for service in the Air/; and to point out the further fferious results; which will ensue, unless some of these men are restored.As was explained in a paper which the First Lord submitted to the War Cabinet some weeks age, the Admiralty anticipate greatly increased activity on the part of enemy aubixiarinoas whose numbers by the end of this year will be greater than at any previous poriod of the War0    In the light of this faot9 the arming of Merchant Ships assumes a position of even greater importance than formerly0    At the tmd of last year9 three large Michino-shop Extensions were begun for the purpose of increasing the output of guns for Merchant Shipa, At that time6 it was not anticipated&quot;that skilled men would be taken from Admiralty Workshops for the Services, and it was confidently expected that the Extensions emb&amp;tked upon could be mannod by diluting the labour in the existing works, and spreading the skilled labour over a wider area0    The Extensions referred ts are now completed^ but the result of taking men for the Colours from the Admiralty Workshops has been that, at the present moment,, it is found impossible to man the new werka, and a considerable amount of machinery is now standing idle. By means of these Extensions, it had been hoped to double the output of guns for Merchant Craft?, bub at the present time it is found impossible to get any increase at all,    It was originally intended to supply the requisite number.of auns by November 19190 Under the conditions at present existing, if further labour is not supplied, it will be impossible to complete the Programme before May,1920,The position is rendered more difficult, by the fact that arrangements upon which the Admiralty were relying, were mado some time ago with the Ministry of Munitions, for the turning over of certain G-unHprbducing capacity to the manufacture . of guns for Merchant Ships,    Recently^ however, the Admiralty were informed by the Ministry of Munitions that, owing to the lack of skilled labour, the Ministry were experiencing great difficulty in manning their machines for the production of their own guns, which were accordingly being seriously delayed; and that it was impossible to forecast any time at which tho Admiralty would obtain the use of the works in question.The lack of labour hasbeen responsible for similar difficulties in the production of guns for the Naval Graft which are operating against enemy submarines.The manufacture of Gun Mountings is being very seriously delayed for the same reason.Another form of production which is being gravely orippled from lack of labour at the present time, is that of Director Firing G-ear0    This is a form of equipment which is of vital importance to the fighting ships$ but the supplies which are necessary for our Destroyer Fleet have been put back by a pexfcd of 3ix months, through the absence of the skilled men who arsalone capable...
alone capable of making the necessary gear0    The production of Torpedo Tubes is similarly affected.Further, it will be recollected that it ha3 been found essential to supply the Battle Fleet with outfits of a new form of Armour Piercing Shell,,    Tho production of this highly important material has, up till now, not realised more than one-fifth of the quantity deemed to be tho minimum ossontial there are not now enough men to attain the required output.The possibilities of reinforcing the existing supply of labour^ in the case of these various commodities, by means of further Dilution, have been carefully investigated; but Tnere is no prospect of any appreciable help of this kind being usefully employed,    Consideration has also been given to the purchase from Japan of many of the guns required^ but the Treasury have twice refused thoir sanction to proposals which were made for this ourpose.In those circumstances, the Admiralty is ecmpllled -although with great reluctance - to put the position before the War Cabinet,, in order that it may be made clear that without an additional supply of labour, the Admiralty mftst fail in attaining essential objects.Since the month of February, the Admiralty has given up from the Workshops under its jurisdiction over 17,000 men to the Army0    Recently the War Cabinet sanctioned the return of 600 men out of thfe number for some of the purposes above enumerated.    The further complement of skilled men now required for these purposes is 1^400 n   In addition to the number of skilled men stated above, 350 uncJcLlledmen are required for the manning of an feplcsivVFilling Factory at Leamington, The explosive in question is used for Admiralty A9Pfl0,,shell, and working with it is highly dangerous for health and io unsuitable for women.    According to medical instructions, only Grade A men under 45 years of age should be employed in dealing with it.    Every endeavour has been made to obtain this labour in the ordinary wa/, but with little ouocess.(Signed) .    R.Ee WEMXBS.18th October,1913
