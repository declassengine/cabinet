All guns, machine guns, ammunition and stores for the Yilderim group y/ere collected in Haidar Pasha at the time.

From G.O.C. Mesopotamia.To     C.I.G.S.October 22nd.X.4341.Your 42321.A. Beyond my X.4095 of October 8th there are no details re explosion.B. According to Turkish officer camp gossip Talaat credited with inclination for peace thus causing conflict between his views and those of Enver Pasha who favours energetic prosecution cf war.C. Several officers had heard of recall of Djemal Pasha was con sequent on his making difficulties at Aleppo.   He had gone to Berlin and on return thence was to take over&quot; at Constantinople from his deputy the duties of Minister of Marine.D. Turkish offioers are uncommunicative.   Following details from Arab officers Armenian doctors refer actually to period about March 1917 but officers say conditions now are if anything accentuated.     Turkish people are heartily sick of war and both people and army officers pessimistic regarding outcome:   people however have no voice and are under the thumb of the governmentas any opposition leaders are quickly removed.According to Arab officers Arabs disaffection against the Turks is growing in Syria but Arabs can accomplish little in present oiroumstances owing to Turks removal of leaders and constant watchfulness.       This disaffection will not affect efficiency cf Turkish fighting forces, as Arab soldiers on the fighting fronts are negligible in quantity.High prices for food stuff prevail at Constantinople Aleppo and elsewhere.     These led to maximum retail pricos cf eatables and various other necessaries being fixed by Government Committees.     Families of officers and men on service are being rationed by Government at half market rates and this system has been extended lately to civilians and some families.In Ramadi in September lire notes fetched 15 to 20 piastres.     In Aleppo 4 notes and in Constantinople 2i to 3 notes for 1 gold lira.     Turkish railways reserved exclusively for military requirements barring 1 train per week for civilians.Note.     1 Lira in peace time was worth 100 piastres.     In, Nazareth recently 1 Lira was only worth 10 piastres.
