GYH, Barnes, fPrevieus y^tri, 0.T.324S &amp; G.T..2266)The question of wages referred by the War Cabinet in ..JH^t-JClnut* 12,has &quot;been settled on a basis, as settut In 0.T.2282.    Instead of advancing only the smaller body of men, in literal fulfilment of Mr.Churchill1 e pledgewas decided to include in addition, the rank-and-file skilled men on production,In view ef complications, a word or two of explana-tion way be ef interest to the War Cabinet.     The smaller number of men included in the proposal eutoitted by Mr.Churchill are those who eannot by any possibility bo places on individual piece work, and in respect to whom, Kajor Hills&apos; Committee found that no system of collective piece work or bonus was applicable.    The larger number includes a good number who,could be on piece work but who for various reasons, are paid on time rates,The case of the $iees workers remains to be considered. The $eim.it tee en $reduction affirm that these workers will put ferward a claim on the ground that the amount of their earnings over the new time rate standard will be less than over the old one.     The &quot;dilutee&quot; piece worker, however, may be ruled out from this consideration.    Their earning, over tho time rets standard, - either the skilled or seai-skilled standard,* eith are far in excess of anything of which they had eny previous experience, or of which the engineering trade generally has had any previous knowledge.The point of the CeBWittee on Production ia regard to the piece worker has application only to the skilled piece worker&apos;a earnings as compared with the skilled time worker1a standard wages.     These earnings have ranged from 20 to 30$ above the time standard.     If the piece prices were such as to yield less, then it has been&quot;generally re-Cognised that there was a ease for re-adjustment.     It lias beon the haggling over this re-adjustment which haa led te most of the trouble about piece work.     If there are cases now where the piece worker is not earning an appreciable amount over the time rate standard wage, then there is no reason why they should not be brought forward for re-adjust-meat, even though such small excess earnings date back to pro-w^r days.     Such local re-adjustments were constantly being wide before the w*r, and I see no reason why they should not be made now as a question in &quot;difference&quot; and settled by the Ministry of Labour,
General advances, liewevtr. in the engineering trades have invariably be** giv% to time and piec*j workers alike;   the one being either *n hourly or weekly advance, $nd the other1 a percentage increase oh piece prices, ihu-a, if the. time workers get * penny an kour, or 4/- a week advance^ the piece worker would get his price3 advanced ten percent or sufficient to yield him a corresponding amount on his earning.     The pi see work men may now make a claim for increased prices.      Of course, mary of them have shared in the increased prosperity of all piece1 workers due to maintsiia:.oe of piece prices ( in accordance with the Treasury Agreement of April 1915.),and these are now probably earning much above the customary 20 or 50% excess over the time,work rate.     The 12%% advance to the time       &apos;&quot;-workers, however, will set up * new relation, and may in &apos; some cases brim; the piece workers dowii below the recognised standard.    It will fail to,the,Ministry of Labour to deal with any demani which may be made, and which the Kiniaier arid the men hare failed to agree upon.There are also the time workers in the trade whioh are not munition workers, who will not, therefore, share in t&amp;e advance just given.   These, however, are a comparatively small number, and will, if necessary, be dealt with by the Ministry of Labour machinery.      The advance just given covers about half of the whole trade.A word may be added, as to the amount of perotanta^e increase given during the war to skilled engineers as compared ^ith others.     15/* per wees has been awarded to the whole of the men in the engineering and moulding trades.It has been given to all alike irrespective of wage or status.     This represents about 75$ on the labourer&apos;s wage, and about 33$ on that of the skilled worker, some more and some less, ( 15$ en the 60/* weekly of the toolmaker or the earnings o^f the skilled pieoe worker, means %b% of an incraoue but on the 40/- of the rank-end-file fitter or turner, it mnm 37i$ increase).     The wages of coal miners, prior to the la at advance, had amounted to from 30 to 50 per cent in addition to some shift arrangement yielding.     Iron-ore miners and blastfurneoemen and iron and steel millmen t isave received 70 to 80 per cent.    Unskilled workers i: the engineering and kindred trades, 75$.   In the woolleu and worsted industry, 40$ on piece rates and 50$ on time rates, and in the Jute trade, from 30 to 35$.   Taking all industries together, the increase in rates of wages would appear to be from 20% in a non-essential trade up to about 80$ in essen* tial trades.A comparison may else be made with the wages of the men in the engineering end metal trades in Germany.   The follow-ing is taken from the particulars given by the war Trade Intelligence Department, and they cover all men, skilled and unskilled, but no women.G. H, S.16th. October, 1617.
