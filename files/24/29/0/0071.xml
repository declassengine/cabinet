From many sources it has beon made clear to the Governmont that a special Canadian representative at Washington should.be immediately appointed.   Lord Horthcliffe is strongly of this opinion and urged it in most emphatic terms. War conditions have brought about the necessity of promnt and immediate communication with the United States, Government in respect of our affairs.   The multiplicity of departments and commissions at Washington leads to disastrous delay if negotiations are conducted through the Embassy which is over-whelmed with a multitude of important matters not directly concerning Canada,   I propose therefore to appoint Hazen and to give him the designation of High Commissioner or some suitable title.   In matters that may concern the whole Empire he will of course consult with the Embassy but in matters solely touching our affairs he would communicate with the United States Government and its various commissions.   As the appointment will be made without delay I shall be glad to receive immediately any observation of the Colonial Secretary -Ends.Question brought by me before Cabinet this morning.-Full importance of it of course realised by them,   I under-stand however that the appointment is only for the war and that future arrangements v/i 11 still be open to. consideration. I suggest that it would be desirable in the interests of the dominion as well as ours and especially having regard to what passed between your Prime Ministor and myself during his recent visit that Mr. Hazen should be attached to the Embassy in Washington while of bourse full control over him would be retained by the Dominion Government.LOHCr
