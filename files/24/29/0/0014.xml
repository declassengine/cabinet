Its work is clearly such as falls within the sphere of the Ministry of Food, and accordingly, after discussions and correspondence In which I understood that the principle of transferring the work and   organization was assented to by the War Office, a letter was written on September 20th from the Ministry of Food to the Board of Trade formally asking for the transfer.   The Board of-Trade referred the letter for observations to the War Office and I have now received from the War Office a copy of their reply, dated October 4th..   This reply -of which a copy is attached * raises issues on which I am bound to ask for the early decision of the War Cabinet.The War Office letter of October 4th in effect makes assent to the transfer of the Board of Trade organization conditional upon assurances by the Food Controller that he will make no change in personnel or accommodation of the 3taff,   While I am anxious, so far as possible, to meet the wishes of the Army Council, I am not able to give such assurance or to admit the right of the Army Council to ask for them.I do not propose in this memorandum to enter into any detailed discussion of particular points which arise in connection with the transfer, but to lay before the War Cabinet the two general principles which appear to me to govern the question:-(1)   The control of the purchase and distribution of imported meat and cheese is a function proper to the Food Controller.   Unles^s
he possesses this power he cannot fulfil the duties of economising and maintaining the food supplies of the country, which have been placed on him by Parliament.     The purchase of imported meat and cheese for the Army and for the civilian population has not been and cannot be separated.(2) The Food Controller must have a free hand to determine by whom and in what manner the work for which he is cosponsihle shall be performedo     He cannot submit to any stipulations on such matters by the Army Council or by other Departments.4I may add that I have recently, on behalf of the British Government, completed an agreement with the French and Italian Governments for getting up an Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive to undertake, on account of the Allies, all foreign purchases of meat, bacon, butter, cheese, margarine, both for civilian and for military purposesrThis agreement was made with the full concurrence of the Avmy Council, conveyed in their letter of August 25.     It Is impossible to reconcile the positions taken by the Army Council then and now, or to give effect to the Heats and Fats Executive Agreement if independent purchases on behalf of the&quot; Army are allowed to continueI ask accordingly that instructions may be given by the War Cabinet for the immediate transfer to the Ministry of Food of the Board of Trade organization for the purchase of foreign and colonial meat and cheese, without any conditions as to personnel or accommodation for v/hich I alone must be responsible.RHONDDAgfelSTKY OF FOOD, October 1917.
5/Sen.No./8297 ($.*.Gi6.)Sir,I aa commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge receipt of your communication dated 28th September, 1917, forwarding a copy of a letter addressed to the Secretary, Board of Trade, by the Ministry of Food, relative to the transfer to that Ministry of the existing organization for the purchase and distribution of Foreign Meat.In reply I am to offer the following observations:-1. Hhen the Army Council notified to the Kinistry of Food under their letter of the 3rd August 1917, they expressly stipulated that in the event of the existing Board of Trade purchasing organization being transferred to the I-inistry of Food I there should be no change in such organization. They accordingly  j attach the greatest importance to this stipulation and could in no way be a party to the transfer under any other conditions.ofConsequently, before the Army Council can agree to an such transfer it will be necessary to obtain from the Ministr: Food their positive assurance that not only will the existing organization be transferred as it stands, but also that no changes! in its personnel shall be made at any time without the concurrencel of the Army Council.2. In further elaboration of paragraph 1 the Army Council desire to stipulate that not only must existing arrangements remain undisturbed as regards the personnel, but also as regards the present accommodation of the staff.   It must be remembered that the head of the organization, Sir Thomas Robinson, is the representative of the Government of &apos;bu3ensland, and it is necessary that he should at all times be accessible, not only to the Heat Organization, but also to the staff of the &apos;^uesnsland Government.   In no other way can he carry out his duties satisfactorily, and., while nothing could be gained, great inconvenience would result to Sir Thomas Robinson&apos;s functions, if the staff were removed from its present Offices,3 TheArmyCouncil attach thegreatestimportance to the unfettered freedom of access of Sir Thomas Robinson, to the Ministerial Heads of Departments.   This arrangement has obtained hitherto, and it is difficult to see how this extremely complex organization could remain equally efficient under other conditions The experience of the Council shows that the direct relations with Foreign Ministries maintained by Sir Thomas Robinson haveSecretary:,.,   Board of Trade.enabled/LONDON,4th October,1917.
enabled the most difficult situations to be overcome to the satisfaction of all the Allied Governments, in such cases as, for instance, the diversion of a eergo from one Government to another .4. The jcmy -Council are somewhat apprehensive regarding the attitude the Allied Governments wdght assume towards - the proposed transfer.   There is in any ca.se ample evidence that the French Army Authorities are always uneasy as to the proportion of meat allocated to British civilian needs, and It should be remembered that the Board of Tr-c-oe Or-garization have consistently refused to make any provision for the French Civil population, and they are still some 30,000 to 40,000 tons behind delivery to the French Army.. Eotvrithstanding, the organization has succeeded in maintaining the complete confidence of the French Army -Authorities, but it is extremely   doubtful whether this would continue if the proposed change were to take place *     If it .doe.s not continue a serious situation might conceivably arise with regard to British Army Supplies.   The same remarks apply to Italy.5. The movement and allocation of refrigerated tonnage in inseparably connected with the efficiency of the Arr-T r.eat Supply. TMs necessitates the closest possible cooperation with the shipping authorities, and the measure of discretion and guidance- now permitted to the *&apos;eat Organization by the Ministry of Shipping is the combined result of many years of continuous working with the cormerciairheads of that Department as well as the experience gained during the war.     Without this measure of freedom which is mainly personal in its element, the mainfe&amp;35*hce of supplies would in the opinion of the ^-rmy Council be impossible, and the Council understand that the ministry of Shipping would not feel able to continue to extend this measure of freedom to the I eat Organization if the contemplated change should result in any change in the personnel or alteration of existing methods.6. The Council,are not of course precisely aware of how the Officials of the Board of Trade directly connected.with the meat supply would be likely -&quot;to view the transfer of their services to the Kirvistry.   But the Council desire to take this opportunity of expressing their absolute reliance in the abilities and judgment of these officials and it would be deplorable if their freedom of action were in any degree fettered by the intervention of other Officials of the Ministry wholly unacquainted with the intricasies of the subject, and lacking&apos; the essential experience gained during the last 3 years. .7. riiially, apart from the organization dealing with purchase, shipment and delivery, the Council are compelled to consider the position of their own organization for the&quot; detailed distribution to the Troops..They would at once make it clear that: in no circumstance;..: could this purely military organization he handed over to the Ministry, of Food.Distribution to the xroops, is naturally inseparable from the question of storage,  and the Council could obviously not consent to any interference with the freedom.of their distributing agents in deciding where&apos;meat must necessarily be stored, so as to be accessible for distributing purposes... &quot; -In/
In view of the foregoing premises an - stipulations which after full consideration and discussion with departments concerned, the Council feel obliged to record, it now seems more than doubtful whether anything can be gained by the proposed transfer.    Indeed from the further consideration which this question has now received, the Council consider that such a change would be fraught with,serious danger to the adequate maintenance of Army Supplies, and would therefore wish to withdraw the general acquiescence expresse : to the Ministry when thei matter was previously brought forward.In the alternative the Council would suggest that the essential interests of the Ministry of Pood would be completely met, if they assumed full possession and control of all such supplies of imported meat, as are not required for Military purposes, leaving the existing Board of Trade Heat Organization to deal exclusively with Army requirements&apos;.Further if it were found desirable, the Council see, no reason why the Food Ministry should not undertake original purchases in the United States and Canada, contracts for supplies from other main sources being already in existence for the duration of the *&apos;ar and 5 months afterw rds.In these events the Food Controller could count on the cordial co-operation and assistance of all those engaged in this service, whether employed under either The Board of Trade or The War Office.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,B.B. CUBITT.
