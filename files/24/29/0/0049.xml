(f his Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic ^ajesty&apos;s Government.)Intelligence Bureau.SECRET.Department of Information.PIW/014.I,   i^4^i Weekly Heport on Italy, XIV.:-t,-^rrr - y   (Oct.  18th, 1917)The last fortnight has been uneventful in Italy.   Alike on the military front and on what Italian interventionists significantly call the &apos;fronte interno&apos; it has been a period of preparation, of small operations and &apos;making good&apos; The War.On Seat. 29th a limited advance on the Bainsiz&amp;a plateau, 3.E. of the Itsdoni-Podlaka line, gave the Italians command of the rocky ridge which at this point forms a sort of bastion separating the Plateau from the Chiapovano valley.   On the previous day another small operation had improvec- the Italian position on the northern slopes of San Gabriel^ e completing their command of the Valiki Krib and the Dol pass leading from the Isonso between San Gabriele and lionte Santo to the Chiapovano valley.Successful air attacks have been carried out in ?ola and on Oct. 4th a similar attack on the Austrian bases and depots in the Bocche de Cattaro is reported to have inflicted considerable damage. Internal Conditions.The failure of the legal authorities to find in existing legisla-tion any ground on which to rest a charge against lazsari, Secretary of the Official Socialist Party and author of the notorious circular,was perhaps not altogether unwelcome to the Ministry of the Interior, as enabling it to defer the moment for provoking an open breach ^ith the forces of Neutralism.     Keanrrhile preparations are being made on either side for the trial, of strength which must presently come.
By tho extension of military jurisdiction, noted in our last Heport, a stop is put to much direot sabotage of war material produc-tion in&apos;important eentres, since it is no longer possible for Socialist Local Authorities and Socialist Deputies to exploit their official or privileged positions in order to encourage and shelter such movements.The hands of the Government have further been strengthened by the oromulgation of a new Decree which makes any person who contributes in any way to &quot;depressing public confidence, diminishing the power of resistance of the country or prejudicing interests connected with the r;ar and with the internal or international situation of the State&quot; to a penr.lty of five years imprisonment and     fine of 5000 lire.    In cuses of special gravity the penalty m-\y be increased to 10 yer.rs im-prisonment and a fine of 10,000 lire.The unofficial adversaries of Neutralism on their p-.rt continue to regard the Government with distrust.     The Government, they S&apos;,y, hr.s promised stronger measures and h-:..s made ...t last r. beginning of performance.     But tho Lazsari fiasco, tho permanence of Orlando at the Home Office, the. pledges given by Boselli to the Socialists, the exaggerated respect shown by him for the authority of a discredited Chamber and the Government&apos;s failure to cope with the problems of Food Supply, afford grounds for doubting the will and capacity of the Government to deal with the really serious situation which the winter promises to bring into being.     Socialists call them reactionaries, but what the;/ demand is not reactionary measures but merely an uner-getic maintenance of that national solidarity which is indispensable in time cf war.   A War Cabinet with something approaching a Dictator-shin is what most &apos; interventionists1 really desire;   but in spite cf some talk of a re-emergence of Salandra, there seems to be little prospect of such a plan materialising.   The Government has refused to take upon itself the &quot;responsibility of any deep-going changes in the
1^ porganisation of the Cabinet and in .he Chamber the Neutralists are toostrong to make it safe to provoke a crisis.In the Neutralist camp the official Socialists, the only openopponents of the war, are mere than ever divided in their opinionsregarding the policy to be pursued in the coming session.     Treves, aleader of the Parliamentary group who commands respect by his abilityand great powers cf speech, writes in a Socialist Weekly advocatinga policy of opportunism.   The present Government, he argues, beingobviously hostile to Socialism and Labour, the aim of Socialism mustbe to replace it by a Government, which, though not Socialist, willbe more in sympathy with^the proletariate.     This line of argument isstrongly condemned by the Party Executive represented by Serrati,editor of Avanti, who contends that it is not the present Governmentthat is the enemy of Social Democracy but the whole bourgeois andvcapitalist nation, which has pledger the state to a war a outranoe and a consequent reactionary policy of repression;    that the same state of things exists in England and France no less than in Italy. The true international policy of Socialism in all countries was to make opposition to the war its first business and to treat the defence of constitutional liberties as a secondary matter.Simultaneously we have various signs cf renewed activity among the Giolittians.     First, the talk of a prominent part to be taken in the coming session .by the ex-Minister under Giolitti, Signer Ilitti. Quite recently the publication of a Manifesto, signed by 45 Deputies belonging to various groups, which is in effect an invitation to Deputies to rally to the defence of Parliament against the attacks of reactionary Interventionism.     The signatories are described by an Interventionist organ as&quot;belonging to 4 categories (1) nobodies; (2) Giolittians;    (3) Germanophils;    (4) Clericals&quot; and the Interven-tionist press trios to smother the movement in a shower of ridicule.
- 4 -Meanwhile the group shows signs of growing and may become formidable. The object attributed to it by the Nationalist organ is that of &quot;pushing the neutralist idea under cover of economic and social difficulties with the support of the Official Socialists.&quot;On the other hand we have the action of Giolitti in transmitting by telegram to Boselli the text of a patriotic resolution voted on Oct. 8th by the Provincial Council of Cuneo, of which he is President. The resolution conveys the &quot;warm greetings of the Council to His Excellence Boselli, who from the concord of all Italians draws the promise, the assurance and the guarantee for that desired victorious peace which,, assigning to the nation its natural frontiers and libera-ting its oppressed brethren,, will be the triumph of justice and civilisation&quot;.     Ciclitti&apos;s gesture is interpreted as a promise of support to the Government ana as a veto on any immediate bid forV &quot; &quot; 1 &quot; 1      11,1power by his followers.*7e have already noted that a.considerable section of Clericals has also, in reaction against Socialist excesses^ modified its pacifist propaganda, and proclaimed its general sympathy with the national feeling and aspirations.     This tendency is reinforced by the Execu-tive of the Azioni Cathcliea, which in a circular severely reproves the extreme propaganda of certain Clerical circles.It seems iihely, therefo-re, in the Session of Parliament, which opened on Oct. 16th, mutual distrust will maintain the chronic state cf unstable equilibrium between the various groups and enable the Government to survive. Food Control.In regard to the Commissariatc dei Consumi all that has so far been decided is that it shall bo incorporated in the Ministry of the Interior. -   The object cf this change is to enable the Department to
deal on an equal footing and to maintain contact with related Gcvern-ment Departments - Agriculture, Transports, etc.   On the further question of the precise relation of the Commissary General to the Minister of the Interior - whether he shall be practically independent (like the Department of   Munitions before it was erected into a Ministry) or a mere Under Secretary in the Ministry of the Interior -a difference of opinion arose between Orlando and Canepa.     They also differed dm their views on re-organisation of the executive machinery. Canepa submitted to the Cabinet a scheme cf re-organisation, ?/hich was rejected;   and he thereupon resigned.     Efforts were made to retain him in tho llinistry by the offer of &amp;he post of Under Secretary for Agriculture, but this he refused.     Canepa is a (Reform) Socialist and has been the object of very bitter attacks from tho Nationalist press as having attempted to favour the Socialist Oo-operative Societies ill his scheme for a National Pood Control Committee.     He probably wishes to have a perfectly free hand in defending his policy when the subject is discussed in the Chamber.General Alfieri has been appointed to succeed Signer Canepa as Pood Controller.   General Alfieri was Intendant General of the Army in 1915. and is said (to have shown marked capacity in organising and administering the Army Supply Services during the critical period of preparation and during the earliest period of Italy&apos;s war.     He was later Under Secretary of State for War and, since last July, Under Secretary in the newly-created Llinistry of Arms and Munitions.     In this post he is succeeded by a civilian, Signer Bignami. The Harvest cf 1917.The Minister for Agriculture states in a communication to the press that the wheat harvest of 1917, so, far as it is possible at present to calculate, amounts to 36 million quintals as against an average of
48 millions;    the maize crop amounts to 23 million quintals, asagainst an average of 26;   barley &quot;and rye to 2,650,000 quintalsas against an average cf 3,950,000.     Rice crop (without husk)3,300,000 - about equal to that of 1916.     The exact figures for thepotato and bean crops are not yet to hand but, whi3ie the yield hasbeen above the average in some parts of Northern Italy, it has beenpoor in Central and still more so in Southern Italy.      iltogetherthis crop is certainly below the average.Speaking at Salerno on Oct. 6th Signor Raineri said that in con-sideration of the incrased cost of production the Government hadfixed minimum prices for the grain crop of 1916 throughout thekingdom.     These would be:-For soft grain 52 lire per quintal. &quot;   hard     &quot;     60     &quot;     &quot;      &quot;In consideration of the exceptional difficulties of the SouthernProvinces and the islands, an additional 7,50 lire on soft grainand 9 lire on hard grain had been sanctioned in their case.External Relations.Greece.In reply to enquiry from the Foreign Office regarding the reported extension of Italian occupation beyond the Zonitza district, Mr.   . Erskine reports that the Italian Government proposes to retain rlcnitza until the French evacuate 2 of the 4 villages in the Sarandaporon valley commanding the road from Santi Quaranta to Macedonia.&apos;     The French decline to evacuate unless the Italians agree not tc occupy any of the 4 villages in question.     The Italian Foreign Minister points out that the road referred to forms the sole line&apos;of retreat for the Italian army in case of a disaster in Macedonia and that therefore it is essential, that- it should be properly guarded. .. According to him any difficulties which may have arisen with the Hellenic Government, on this subject are due to. the
action cf General Sarrail.It appears from Mr. Crackanthorpe&apos;s reports that the Italian Minister in Athens had, in conversation with the Greek Minister for foreign Affairs, held language which might be interpreted as intended to discourage the intervention of Greece in the war --apparently by representing peace as imminent.     He is said to have alluded to the strength of the Socialist peace movement in Italy as being so strong that his Government might be unalle to resist it and to have asserted that Italy had   been &quot;discouraged of late by a lack of sympathy on the oart of her Allies&apos;.     Mr. Cracknnthorpe suggests th :-.t Italy is cnxious to prevent a successful mobilisation, and regards it as in her interest to perpetuate r, condition of weakness and unrest in Greece.     According to other informants, it is probable that France also is pursuing a similar policy in&apos; Greece&apos; (Western and General Report, Got. 10th)J.C.P.
