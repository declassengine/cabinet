The Board of Trade have now received the following Reports from the Departmental Committees appointed by them to consider the position of certain industries and groups of industries:-Ine Coal &quot;Irade, the Iron and Steel Trades, the Lngin-eering Trades, the Slectrical Trades, the Shipbuilding Industry and the Textile Trades.T&amp;e ^ar Cabinet have decided on the recommendation of the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office that in view of the important questions of policy raised in these Reports - they should not be published at present;   but it has now been represented to the Board that the Reports contain much valuable information and many recommendations and suggestions which do not raise questions of Governmental policy and in-volve only action which could be taken by the Trades them-selves.    Suck are, for example, the sections of the various Reports relating to the general organisation of the various Trades, including the formation of associations for the con-federation of general questions affecting the industries and combinations for securing supplies of raw materials and for marketing;   methods of production ;   standardisation;   general and technical education;   apprenticeship;   and scientific and technical research.    It has been urged upon the Board of Trade that as questions of these kinds are now being widely discussed amongst British manufacturers and traders in their consideration of the steps which can be taken without Govem-ment assistance towards securing the greater efficiency ofBritish/
British trade and industry after the war, it would he veryuseful if the conclusions of the Committees on th6S6 subjectscould be published, since they would be likely to exercisea great influence in the respective trades.It appears to me that there is much force in these re-presentations, and I should accordingly bo glad of theauthority of the Tfer Cabinet to publish either in the &quot;Boardof Trade Journal11 or in such other manner as would be likely theto secure^requisite publicity such extracts from the Reports bearing on the subjects named above, and on otter matters affecting individual trades, as do not in my judgment raise any question of general Government policy, whether internal or affecting foreign relations,I have consulted the Minister of Reconstruction who agrees with t&amp;e above proposal,(Signed),  A.IK STANLEY18th October, 1917,
