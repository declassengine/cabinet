Ij     1&quot;y&apos;^OARD OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.-*  (v)j Mil*   To&amp;oidddkaddrcs^wtimmunicationsto:- FOOD   PRODUCTION   DEPARTMENT,% \ *-The Director General.IV y 72, Victoria Street,London, S.W, (1).tf^w----------- 17th October, 1917.Sir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Pood Production Department for the week ended 16th October:-The principal events since the compilation of last week&apos;s Report have been the Prime Ministerfs speech to the Agricultural Deputation on October 9th, and the announcement by the Food Controller of his concessions In the matter of meat prices.The latter has gone far to mitigate the most serious and glaring hardship under which farmers were labouring, whilst the recognition of their patriotism and services, contained in the Prime Minister!s speech, has heartened them greatly and cannot fail to have a most stimulating effect upon food production generally,LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees.   The Essex Committee have arranged for the surrender of a badly cultivated farm to be effected between landlord and tenant, no claim being made on either side for dilapidations or tenant right.     The East Sussex Committee have been authorised to take possession of three farms near Chailey aggregating 300 acres, p/hich are at present in the owner&apos;s hands; they propose letting the farms to tenants selected by the ownerfs agent and approved by the Committee, but subject to the tenants undertaking to carry out the cultivation as required by the Committee Breeches of Defence of the Realm Regulations.    In Huntingdonshire a farmer near Ramsey, a large owner and occupier of land, has been fined  10 for failure to comply vith an order made in August, 1917, to break up, fallow and cultivate 96 acres of pasture land for the 1918 crop.   The defence was inability to secure cultivating tackle,
pressure of work and shortage of labour.     In Somerset the prosecution of Mrs. Bonham Christie for failure to cultivate her kitchen garden (four or five acres in extent), which was referred to in the Report for the week ending 19th September, 1917, has resulted In a fine of  5 and  5 costs.     The defendant admitted that she had only been in her garden once since Christmas, and stated that she had applied for 20 soldiers but had only been allotted two.     The Bench said there was no evidence that more than two soldiers had been applied for, but found that there were strong mitigating circumstances which they did not specify. Drainage of Lands.    In Cheshire the Committee have been serving notices under the Drainage of Lands Orders for the cleansing out of water courses on particular farms.   The Committee for the Lindsey Division of Lincoln are calling upon the Newark Court of Sewers to exercise their powers for the cleansing of the Darn Syke.   In the West Riding the Committee are directing the Linton Navigation Commissioners to open their sluices when the Ouse is high, and have induced the Highways Committee to clear the silt from the arches of their bridge over the Crimple Beck.     The Flintshire Committee have succeeded in obtaining the consent of the owners to the Improvement, at their expense, of the drainage of three areas of land at Prestatyn (aggregating about 280 acres), in accordance with a scheme prepared on behalf of the Committee.     The greater part of this land will, it is hoped, yield a crop in 1918, and would not have been cultivable but for this undertaking. Damage by Game.   Action under the Rabbits and Pheasants Orders is reported from Norfolk, Somerset, East Suffolk and Surrey. Determination of Tenancies.   During the week four Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 388 acres, and seven Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 300 acres.Provision of Land for Allotments. Reports from 1,090 districts have now been received showing that 199,246 applications were made forA
plots, and 180,311 plots comprising 13,264 acres have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917 (No.2).HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. During the week 55 demonstrations in fruit bottling have been held.     Fourteen Home Canners have been sold, making a total of 154, and 7,632 cans, making a total of 104,914. Allotment Programme for 1918.      The Department has drawn up the following outline programme for 1918 based on the experience gained this year:-(1)   To secure the provision of more land for allotments(a) in order to satisfy applicants at present unprovided with allotments,(b) to encourage a large increase in the number of applications for allotments,(c) and to permit of increase in the size of existing allotments so as to provide for allotment holders, who have the necessary skill and leisure to cultivate them intensively, allotments sufficiently large to make each holder and bis family self-supporting with respect to vegetable produce.(2)   To provide increased security of tenure for allotment holders.(3)   To these ends, to urge the national importance ofextending the powers existing in the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917.(4)   To secure forthwith that, in all town planning schemes, the need for the provision of permanent allotments shall be considered and provided for.(5)   To form a National Register of Allotment Holders: toencourage Allotment Holders to form Local Associations, and Local Associations to combine in a National Federation of Allotment Holders.(6)   To establish close co-operation between Local Societies, the National Federation and the Food Production Department with the objects of:-(a) providing allotment holders with advice and instruction by means of skilled instructors, lectures, demonstrations, pamphlets and leaflets,(b) arranging for the co-operative purchase of seeds, tools and manures, and for improving the amenities of permanent allotments,(c) providing where necessary for the systematic marketing of surplus produce.
TECHNICAL DIVISION.Seed Testing Station.   The equipment of the Seed Testing Station is well advanced;   the available rooms have been allocated; and the laboratory arrangements are nearly complete.     Mr. RlG. Stapledon, M.A., Advisory Botanist of the University College of Falesj Aberystwyth, whose services have been lent to the Department during the war, has been appointed Director of the Station.   / staff of seed enumerators Is being trained.     ^t is expected that the Station will be ready to receive samples from the trade and from farmers early next month.Stack Building.   In view of the serious damage done by the unfavourable weather to corn crops In some southern and western districts, an enquiry Is being held as to the possibility of extending the special methods of harvesting and stacking practised in certain wet and late districts, and of making greater use of such appliances as drying racks, bosses etc.     A leaflet will be issued on the subject when the enquiry is completed. Milking Machines.   An enquiry Into the use of milking machines, end the possibility of improving existing types is being conducted. Information is being obtained from nine of the principal manufacturers, and from about 200 farmers, who are known to possess or to have possessed milking machines.Fruit Pests,   A memorandum giving detailed Information as to crops to be sprayed, pests etc, and containing suggestions for a spraying campaign next season has been prepared.LABOUR DIVISION. Soldier Labour. The War Office have issued an Army Council Instruction notifying Commands etc, that soldiers sent out for the harvest are to be made available for the 1918 programme.     Any of these men who, after examination and re-classification in co-operation with the Commissioners of this Department, can be
Q classed as skilled will be reckoned as Included among theskilled men to be found by the Military Authorities for the special programme *     The remainder of the men retained by farmers will be transferred to the Labour Corps and posted to Agricultural Companies, being counted against the number of unskilled men.Officers Commanding Units at home have also had their attention drawn to the fact that men of Categories &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; who are experienced farm workers and who still remain with their units should be made available at once for the 1918 programme.     It is to be hoped that this will result in more men becoming available immediately to be sent to the Distribution Centres.     A list, shewing the allocation of a further 5,000 skilled men, has been sent to the War Office, who have been asked to make further men available at once at several of the Distribution Centres where unsatisfied demands are outstanding.It is not possible this week to state the number of soldiers made available to date and sent out for the 1918 programme as many of the Commandants in their new returns have included all the harvest men among the skilled soldiers, and others have not Included the harvest men as instructed. Approximately about 23,000 out of tho 43,000 men - Scotland is to receive 7,000 of the 50,000 sanctioned by the ^&apos;ar Cabinet -to be made available for the programme are now out on the land in England and Trales.     Urgent and frequent demands for more skilled ploughmen are being received.The number of men supplied for training as tractor drivers is now 939, and, in addition, 106 men have been supplied for work with steam ploughs, and 48 as drivers for   * threshing tackle.   The names of 41 men required to drive
threshing engines have Been forwarded to the War Office, with the request that their services may be made available among the skilled men for the 1918 programme.HorSes.      Orders for the issue of 502 horses have been sent out during the week, making a total of 2,805 horses to date Prisoners of War.      In the case of several of the agricultural prisoner camps where the men have been accommodated under canvas during the summer, arrangements are now in course of completion for the transfer of the men to permanent quarters, in order that their services may remain available throughout the winter.   Two further prisoner camps have been opened during the week, bringing the total number of prisoners now employed from agricultural camps to 3,256.    In addition, 668 prisoners from the parent camps and 1,253 aliens are now employed on the land, making a total of 5,177 prisoners now on farm work.   Requests have been sent to the Far Office during the week for additional prisoners, amounting to 400 in all, to be sent to certain of the existing camps,Blacksmiths and Wheelwrights. The Ministry of National Service have been approached for assistance in connection with the urgent need of blacksmiths and wheelwrights in country districts, and, In order that the matter may be placed fully before that Ministry, Agricultural Executive Committees have been asked to furnish information at an early date of the number of smithies and wheel-wrights&apos; shops in their county that are closed or under-staffed. Agricultural Workers and Aerodromes.   Representations have been received during the week that, in the case of two new aerodromes, agricultural labourers in the district have been taken on by the contractors, and the Tar Office have been asked to make immediate enquiries into this matter, and to take steps to prevent any farm workers being displaced by work connected with the construction of new aerodromes.
Women&apos;s Branch.A Conference was held during the week between representatives of this Branch, the Forage Committee of the War Office, the Timber Supply Department of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour on the subject of the proposed co-operation between the first three Departments.It is under consideration whether the term &quot;Women&apos;s Land Army&quot; should not be extended to include, in addition to workers recruited by the Board of Agriculture, those women recruited under the auspices of the Forage Committee and the Timber Supply Department.   The result of the proposed scheme should be to d^ away with unemployment, as the women will be interchangeable between the three Sections, and a sudden demand for a particular piece of work to be done in connection with either Section will be met by pooling the resources of the three Departments.The following report from the South Wales Inspector shows the results of the National Service Scheme in her district&quot;Three hundred and fifty three N.S.V&apos;s are actually engaged on farm work in my area;    thirty-three have been lent for forestry, and twenty-five for peat-stacking. The percentage of failures Is small, and the general ver-dict Is one of satisfaction.   The number on farm work may seem small for seven counties.   It is in reality a large figure for my area where five of the counties are very sparsely populated, the farms small, and the accom-modation in many cases impossible.   The recruits are drawn, for these five counties, almost entirely from Glamorgan, and a few from Monmouth.&quot;The process of weeding-out undesirable N.S.V&apos;s has been going on steadily.   Some have dropped out of their own volition, having failed to stand the test of farm work under the unfavourable weather conditions.   The remainder will provide the nucleus of a really efficient Land Army for this area, or for whatever area they may be most needed.   The most pressing demand is for milkers and carters.   There have been sporadic demands for hedgers, ploughwomen, rabbit-catchers, and thatchers.
&quot;The result of the advent of N.S.V&apos;s in my area is interesting.   Congested Glamorgan is feeding the denuded counties of the West and Mid-Wales..,, giving back the population sucked from the other counties.   If this could only be encouraged on a large scale, Agriculture in ffales would have an entirely different outlook&quot;.This week the Returns show an increase on Farm Workof 266 women.   The number of women accounted for as members ofthe Land Army is 6,784, as follows:-In Instruction Centres ......... 769On Farm work     ... .........     5,772Waiting for references to be placed inTraining Centres      ..*      ...      ... 59Waiting for employment in Depots     ... 69Waiting in their own homes     ......        115MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION. The following statement shows the position as regards the provision of Tractors purchased or ordered by the Department:Consigned to Agricultural Executive Committees up to and including 6th October ...Consigned during the week     ...On offer to CountiesConsigned to Scotland (92) and Ireland (20)Available for forward allocation Titans1,435 61 184112__251,817SUPPLIES DIVISION. Supplies Sub-Committees.     A circular has been issued to Supplies Sub-Committees drawing their attention to the position as regards various fertilisers.   Those Sub-Committees which have not yet appointed 4pproved Agents have been asked to take immediate steps in tihis direction as it has been decided that no further Agents can be recognised by the Department after the end of this month.   Satisfactory replies are being received and it is- R -
anticipated that Agents will he appointed in practically every county before the list is finally closed.Sulphate of Ammonia. During September 21,700 tons of sulphate of ammonia were delivered for agricultural purposes, this amount being practically identical with the production.Returns from makers show that their estimate production for the eight months October 1917 - May 1918 will be about 176,000 tons, but this figure may prove to be an under-ostimate as the Ministry of Munitions is inclined to place it about 20,000 tons higher.   From this supply the following definite demands have to be met, viz:-tonsForward contracts already placedfor home agricultural use......      72,000Requirements for Munitions (minimum)     46,000Delivery direct to farmers from localgas works within 10 mile radius ...       20,000Export to France, Italy, Portugaland British Colonies (minimum)    ...        5,000Orders in the hands of Distribution Committee, not yet placed ......       13,000Total    ...     156,000The balance available in the eight months October -May to meet orders not yet put forward is therefore only 20,000 tons.   Any increase in production above the 176,000 tons referred to is likely to be absorbed by additional demands for munitions.tonsThe amount sold for home agriculturesince June 1st, 1917, is   ......       62,000The above figures show a furtheramount for home agricultural use of     125,000Total available for year June 1917 - 187,000 May 1918. ___^The Department is seeking an assurance from theMinistry of Munitions that their requirements will not exceedthe amount above stated.
Superphosphate.   According to returns made by manufacturers the quantity of phosphate rock received by them in September was only 18,000 tons while the quantity of superphosphate manufactured was 27,700 tons.   These quantities are exceptionally low, and a number of works are now only working part time.   There is a considerable quantity of superphosphate in stock, but it i3 very unevenly distributed in different parts of the country.   Arrange-ments for distribution are being made by this Department jointly with the Ministry of Munitions.Basic Slag.   The production of basic slag for the month of September was 48,500 tons and the deliveries 53,000 tons.   These are the maximum figures yet reached, the previous highest figure of monthly production being under 40,000 tons. Lime.   The returns for September so far as they have been received indicate a much increased production as compared with last year, and, so far as can be ascertained, the agricultural demand is being met.Seed Wheat of the 1917 Crop.   The demand for this wheat up to the present has been disappointing owing to the fact that Supplies Sub-Committees have forwarded very few orders and reliance was placed on their securing orders from farmers.   Steps have now been taken to get into direct touch with the farmers. Merchants and Storage Agents, through whose hands the wheat is passing, are being asked to sell direct to farmers, in order to expedite delivery.Seeds (other than Cereals).   A draft of the proposed Testing of Seeds Order, 1917, has been prepared.   There appears to be no serious opposition on the part of the trade to its introduction. Seed Potatoes. The delay in the issue by the Ministry of Pood of the Seed Potatoes 1917 Crop Order is causing great inconvenience to the trade.   The Department understand that the Ministry hope to issue the Order in the course of the next week.
A meeting was held on the 10th instant (at which representatives of Agricultural Executive Committees were present) to consider a draft of the Department^ scheme for the distribution of seed potatoes for areas infected with Wart Disease and to small growers in other areas.   Certain minor alterations were made, and the draft is now under final consideration and will shortly be issued to the Agricultural Executive Committees.   Steps are being taken to secure as large a portion as possible of suitable varieties, both of immune seed and of susceptible seed, from Scotland and Ireland for distribution in 1918.The efforts of the Department to deal effectively with the farmer&apos;s and small grower&apos;s requirements in seed potatoes are hampered by the uncertain and unsatisfactory position of the trade in ware.   The Department is preparing its seed potato programme on the assumption that there will be a further increase in 1918 on the potato area of 1917.   The high minimum price of  6 for ware is in fact a maximum and the flat rate thus established for all main crop varieties is stopping the sale of those varieties which ordinarily command lower comparative prices.   If growers of such varieties find that their 1917 crops are not marketable at the guaranteed price, they are unlikely to sow as large an area in 1918.   Such a situation would profoundly affect the &quot;seed&quot; provision to be made by the Department.The &quot;seed&quot; negotiations between the Department and the potato trade have brought out very clearly that the fixing of a minimum price for ware in 1918, even if it be considerably lower than the 1917 minimum, is essential in order to secure an increased acreage in 1918.In regard to the scheme for growing immune varieties in Scotland and Ireland in 1918 for distribution in England and

Wales in 1919, negotiations with the Board of Agriculture for Scotland have been carried further and it appears probable that there will be little difficulty in securing contracts for the growth of the potatoes under suitable conditions and on reasonable terms.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
