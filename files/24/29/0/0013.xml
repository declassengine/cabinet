TOIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI5 BRITANNIC MAJEST^S GOVERNMENT.3 S C R. E T. 9 9 :-:- WAR   CABINET.G.T.2313.fe DECISION OP U.S.A.GQYERIfr[ENT TO REQUISITIONALL &quot;VESSELS BUILDING. IN AMERICAN SHIPYARDS.Copy of letter&apos; from the Secretary. Ministry of ,Shipping, to &quot;the Seoretrry, War Cabinet.71960/17., Ministry of Shipping,15th October, 1917. &apos;Sir,I am directed by the Shipping Controller to transmit herewith for the information of the War Cabinet, a copy of a telegram CAppendix A) from his representative in America informing him of the decision ci uhe United States Government to requisition for their owr- service, all the vessels building in the United States to the order of His Majesty!s Government.This matter has been for some time past the subject of negotiations with the American Shipping Authorities and while Sir Joseph Maclay regards the decision now arrived at as a. most unfortunate one, he does not feel that any object would be gained in pressing for its reversal.The amount of tonnage in question is approximately 800,000 tons deadweight carrying capacity and in view of the serious effect which the loss of this quantity of shipping must have upon the carrying out of our essential services, it appears desirable that a formal communication should be sent to the United States Government, accepting their decision, but suggesting that in limiting our ability to maintain our own services end those Allied services for vhich we have hitherto assumedsome share of responsibility, they have taken upon themselves an additional responsibility towards our Allies and ourselves.A proposed draft of a telegram (Appendix B) on these lines is submitted herewith for the consideration of the War Cabinet.I amSir, iYour obedient Servant,(Signed)   John Anderson.APPEND I XA.Situation in Vashinfcten regarding restoration of our ships has taker, decided tc.tr. for 7,-01 sc snipping Board have recommended af t-.tr 3go 1.31 deration thai United States retain all ships delta et ed hsrea/tet nc matter to whom formally belonged giving as their reason urgent military requirements
and President has endorsed this view.    Shipping Board now given us formal notice this decision.    Royden says Chairman of Shipping Board explains this is no alteration his Policy whioh has &quot;been release all ships possible to us but simply means owing unexpeoted large military requirements it will be Impossible to release any more Royden will make special effort to Recover tankers and possibly some of the smaller ships.     So far the legal  jposition is tho Board have seized the ships but have not taken the contracts our opinion and that of our legal advisors is that wo should now press them to tako the oontracts and so end our liability or we may find if these are left as live instruments that builders may&apos; insist after war over upon sustaining these contracts to our disad-vantage and in any case many lawsuits will probably be avoided by extinguishing the contracts   whst is your view   ends.APPENDIX   B.H,M.Government have received end accept v/ithout question or protest the President&apos;s decision to requisition all vessels building in American shipbuilding yards including those build-ing to British orders.     It may bo convenient to repeat British position in regard to these vessels.     The orders were placed early in this year as soon as the commencement of the intensive submarine campaign made it obvious that the shortage of tonnage available for war services would be one of the most important factors in the war.     This action was taken before America entered.the war and was discontinued as soon as there was any indication that continued purchases might embarrass tho future action of the American Government.     The placing of the orders at this early date had the immediately good effect which the American Government will doubtless find to have proved of velue to them of increasing activity in American shipbuilding yards at an earlier dato than if no action had been taken till America   herself had both entered the war end commenced a large Shipbuilding programme.As stated by Mr.BoIfour our anxiety has been to main-tain as far as possible the number of vessels available for war services and H,M,Government have throughout made it clear that they would accept without protest whatever might be the President&apos;s decision in the matter.     We had while the question was under -deliberation ventured to put certain considerations before the American Government which we thought they might fairly be asked to tako into account before deciding.     The chief of these was that our tonnage has during the submarine campaign become seriously inadequate for mMntaining the supplies necessary for our own and our Allios commitments and the vessels in question would have been a valuable though only a partial off-set to the losses.We weloome the statement of the Chairman of the Shipping Board that the vessels havo been taken in view of the military requirements of America and are glad to infer tfjBofe this that America will use these vessels in order to increase by that number the vessels employed in war services.We feel that we must add that while our reduced tonnage would in any event have been insufficient to continue our own
military arid naval effort and also to assist the Allies as much as heretofore and while tho withdrawal of these vessels amounting to a total of somo 800,000 tons dead-weight from us necessarily reduces correspondingly our ability to help our Allies, there is evory indication that through comparatively poor harvestsi etc. the Allies needs will be greater rather than loss, and wo think that it may be convenient to America that as the Allies will therefore be necessarily turning to hor instead of to Great Britain for considerable help, she should have this preliminary indication.
