(This Document is the Property His Britannic &amp;Sajesty*s Government.)OPERATIONS-;From:- Captain Barratt, Roumania,To:-     C.I.G.S., War Office,repeated Petrograd,SECRET.10.10.17. 10.30 p.m.2291B.A.759.To-day General Elchaninoff, Commander of 8th Army Corps, has been relieved of his command.     He is a General who has done exceptionally well, and his Corps fought consistently throughout battle of Maracesti, ultimately being reduced to 3500 bayonets; majority still held its ground.       Russians, Roumanians and all the foreign missions here recognise his ability and Scherbatcheff himself said yesterday that he was his best General:    the 3th Corp; has certainly been and still is a real fighting force. The Committees are responsible for his dismissal.       Before Russian Revolution he was an admirer of the Czar, but has taken no part in politics during the War,   At the beginning of October,however, King of Roumania went to review and decoratehis Corps for the victory of Maracesti, and the Army Gommissaire seized on the occasion to call him away from the PARADE, and accuse him of pro-monarchial views.    Since then the Army Committee has tried to obtain his dismissal,     Scherbatcheff has defended him, and even yesterday was hopeful that he could be retained.  . On October 16th he summoned Elchaninoff to Jassy in the absence of General Ballard on the front.     When I was in possession of all the facts from Elchaninoff himself, I went to see General Berthelot who said that his dismissal -would produce a bad impres-sion amongst Roumanians, and would also make very precarious the -situation of other Russian Generals who had not such record behind them,Berthelot
Berthelot decided that lie would make through his Chief of Staff, Colonel Pctain, strong representations at Petrograd; Petain happened to be proceeding to-day to Petrograd.    In agreement with Berthelot I saw Scherbatcheff at 7 p.m.     Scherbatcheff hoped to arrange the matter locally and thought it would be unnecessary to bring any pressure to bear in Petrograd, but the 4th Arm:/ Commissary arrived later on in the evening, and insisting, Schcrbatcheff gave way. To-day Scherbatcheff and Elchaninoff say nothing further can be done, dismissal being a fait accompli.   However there is this afternoon good authority for believing that Commissaries have prepared a large list for dismissal including General Commanding 4th, 8th and 9th Armies *   Pour Corps Commanders in the&quot;4th Army (from 7th, 8th, 24th and 36th Corps) have been dismissed already during last 15 days by Commissaries, and Gelevine, Chief of Staff to Scherbatcheff, has been removed.    Petain informs me that he is going to Petrograd to see our Ambassador and Military Attache at Petrograd,   I have just seen Prezan who was unaware of the situation, but says a very bad effect will be produced in the Roumanian Army..I have informed General Ballard of the situation and have been acting on his instructions.    He is unable to be here before October 2Oth.
