His Britannic Majestv&apos;s Government)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,&apos;WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. XVI.(October 16, 1917).Department of Information^DRW/016.The General Situation.There has been a regrettable absence of news from Rumania during the past month.   The newspapers to hand, however, covering the   period from August 17/30 down to September 2/15, supply some details as to the successful resistance of the Rumanian armies during August and September.   The papers are unanimous in hailing the battles of Marasesti and the Ojtoz pass as the greatest military successes in Rumanian history.     The situation, however, remains a critical one.     An article in Actiunea Romana called &quot;Give Us Guns&quot; insists on the fact that the feeling in the Rumanian army is that victory is certain if the army can be properly munitioned.     People recently returned from Rumania confirm the impression that the moral of the Rumanian army is higher than it has ever been and that the resistance offered by it to the enemy&apos;s advance far surpassed expectations.   It is not, however, a question only of munitions, but also of the lack of men in view of the fact that a large number of the Russian troops on the Rumanian front have been a handicap rather than a help. So serious is the outlook that Sir G. Barclay points out in a wire (October 7) that the Rumanian Government is unwilling even to parting the 13,000 Jugo-Slav troops whom the Serbian Government naturally wishes to transfer to Saloniki.     In the near future the enemy will presumably make every attempt either to crush Rumania In her exhausted and isolated situation or to compel her to a separate peace.     The first steps in this respect have been taken
by the diffusion through German propagandist agencies of the rumour that the King of Rumania and Mr Bratianu had made overtures for a separate peace to the Central Powers..   One of our agents in Switzerland recently sent in a similar story:   that two Rumanian Statesmen had left for the enemy capitals to negotiate a separate peace.   This story is either a misunderstanding or a perversion of the fact that Messrs Carp and Marghiloman loft early in August far Berlin, - for what purpose it is unknown.     Possibly the Germans, if they fail to force or to cajole Rumania out of the war, may again bring forward their plan of setting up a distinct State in the provinces in their occupation and placing another member of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family on the Throne in Bucarest,As pointed out in a previous Report (No. XIV) they have already set up a Provisional Rumanian Administration in Bucarest. Evenimentul (August 24/September 6) gives a list and short account of the five &quot;Ministers&quot; who are taking part In this Administration, as well as of the various prefects, mayors and police officials who have remained behind in Wallachia and are working with the German Administration.   It mentions these persons in order to pillory them for ever as traitors to the Rumanian cause.     Unless, however, Rumania is completely overwhelmed or is faced by the fact that her Allies will be   unable to help her, there is no danger of those German Intrigues succeeding.   But, as was recently pointed out by a Rumanian writer in the English press, if the idea gets about in Rumania that the Allies are not prepared to keep their promise and sustain Rumania^ justifiable national aspirations, it would be iperfectly impossible to persuade Rumanians to continue the struggle. &quot;Restoration&quot; is no adequate reward in their eyes for assistance
by the diffusion through German propagandist agencies of the rumour that the King of Rumania and Mr Bratianu had made overtures for a separate peace to the Central Powers.   One of our agents in Switzerland recently sent in a similar story:   that two Rumanian Statesmen had left for the enemy capitals to negotiate a separate peace.   This story is either a misunderstanding or a perversion of the fact that Messrs Carp and Harghiloman loft early in August ffir Berlin, - for what purpose it is unknown.     Possibly the Germans, if they fall to force or to cajole Rumania out of the war, may again bring forward their plan of setting up a distinct State in the provinces In their occupation and placing another member of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family on the Throne in Bucarest.As pointed out in a previous Report (No. XIV) they have already set up a Provisional Rumanian Administration In Bucarest.

But, as was recently pointed out by a Rumanian writer in the English press, if the idea gets about in Rumania that the Allies are not prepared to keep their promise and sustain Rumania&apos;s justifiable national aspirations, It would be ^perfectly impossible to persuade Rumanians to continue the struggle. &quot;Restoration&quot; is no adequate reward in their eyes for assistance
in the war, for, as a matter of fact, the Central Powers offer them not only their old territory, but also the province of Bessarabia in return for a separate peace.     This fact is apparently not recognised by the bulk of the papers in this country, which rarely offer Rumania any further prospect than &quot;restoration&quot;.Rumaniafs Relations with her Allies.The Rumanian press is eager to seize on any sign - for there are not many - that the Western Powers are feeling a strong interest in, and sympathy   with, the Rumanian cause.   The messages sent by His Majesty the King, Mr Lloyd George, and the Anglo-Rumanian Society on the occasion of the anniversary of Rumania&apos;s inter-vention in the war were printed in extenso in the Rumanian press and made the occasion for leading articles in all the papers. The foundation of the Anglo-Rumanian Society, for instance, was the subject of a leading article- oh tuo successive days&apos; in-L&apos; Independence Roumaine- and in Romania,    In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that at the present moment Rumanians have come to feel that their future depends very largely on the good-will and support of Britain.   The press Is also naturally filled with accounts of conditions in Russia.     The difficulties in which the Russian debacle have involved Rumania, and, further, the unfortunate and, in many cases, disgraceful behaviour of the Russian troops in Moldavia, have roused all the old antagonism between the two peoples.   But more important than that is the realisation that Rumania is from a military, political and economic point of view almost entirely dependent on Russia. It is for that reason that Rumanians are more anxious than ever they were to tighten the ties of friendship linking them with the
Western Powers. The indignation and anxiety felt by Rumanians at the Russian situation occasionally finds utterance, though heavily censored, in the press, especially in papers like Opinia which were previously pro-German. The patriotic press, however, is anxious to insist on the fact that, as Romania puts it, Russia will again come into her own and that, trying as the times are, there can be no doubt that Russia in the future will be victorious and v-rill be Rumania&apos;s warm friend.Conditions in Bessarabia.The Nationalist Movement in Bessarabia, of which some account was given in Reports XII and XV, is being pushed on with.   At the end of August examinations were held for school teachers in Kishinyov;   350 out of 418 candidates succeeded in passing the examination in Rumanian language and history.   All these teachers are at once to be used in the new primary Rumanian schools which are taking the place of the old Russian schools.   In September the opening of various secondary schools and seminaries was expected. A printing press, using Latin type, is being set up in Kishinyov to print books in Rumanian as well as. a Review, Scoala licldoveneasca (&quot;The Moldavian School&quot;).     Prom the fact that Rumanian national songs are now being freely sung in Kishinyov we may perhaps conclude that the movement is already beginning to take the form of a rapprochement to the Kingdom of Rumania, which at the outset it entirely lacked.     This is presumably due to the fact that Bessarabians are anticipating, rightly or wrongly, the break-up of the Russian Empire into various national States.Rumanian IrredentaThe condition of the Rumanians of Hungary is becoming daily
worse.   To the facts referred to in Reports XIV and XV as to the increased stringency of the Magyar oppression of the Runa nian element, it may he added that Mr Vazsonyi, who has been entrusted with the &quot;reform&quot; of the Hungarian franchise law, recently informed a deputation that he intended to re-arrange the constituencies in Transilvania in such a way that, out of the 64 seats allotted, the Rumans, who form 60 per cent, of the population at least, should not be able to obtain more than 4 seats in parliament.Count Apponyi (Minister of Education), who is planning the wholesale Magyarisation of Rumanian schools and churches in Transilvania, recently declared, according to the Frankfurter Zeitung (October 2): &quot;Transilvania must become a strong Hungarian fortress.   Together with a new military frontier of Hungary a cultural frontier must be created&quot;.     By a new military frontier he means a frontier pushed further over the mountains so as to command still more effectively all the approaches into the Kingdom of Rumania;   by a cultural frontier he has explained that he means a frontier where all the land is held by loyal Magyars, to make room for whom Rumanian landlords have already had their properties confiscated.     The Transilvanian troops, who, as stated in Report XI, have already joined the Rumanian armies, are now, according to a wire from Petrograd (October 1), to be increased, for the Russian Government has given permission to the Rumanian Government to recruit another 30,000 men amongst the Transilvanian prisoners in Russia.Economic Conditions.Conditions continue extremely bad owing to the difficulty of importing food to meet the requirements not only of the Rumanian troops and large numbers of Russians in Moldavia, but\
also many refugees.   A census is now to be taken of the population of Moldavia to find   out exactly how much above the normal it is at present.   Prices have been fixed for various commodities - in some cases very high;   for instance, butter is 14 lei a kilo.   The difficulty is, however, that the food simply does not exist at present in the country.     There are daily Complaints in the press that even vegetables^ which were formerly so easily obtainable and so cheap, are now almost impossible to buy.Propaganda.The enemy continues his propaganda among the Rumanians. The paper Lumina (the first appearance of which at Bucarest was announced in Report XV) is apparently, judging from extracts in it from the German precs, attempting to show the Rumanians that they were &quot;let down&quot; by their Western Allies as well as by Russia.   For instance, an article in it by Victor Verzea, a Rumanian officer who deserted to the enemy, declares that 88 per cent, of the shrapnel sent from England was unusable.   Similarly, extreme Rumanian Socialists of the Rakovski type have now begun to republish the paper Lupta in Odessa, and there is little doubt at all that there is German money behind this latest venture.Meanwhile it is reassuring to note that Rumanians have waked up to the fact that it is necessary for them to begin stating their cause abroad in a clear and continuous fashion.     Not only have two Rumanian papers (see Report XV) been lately started in Paris, but there is also one, VEntente, now appearing in Petrograd, and various Rumanian professors and journalists have recently come to this country, France and Switzerland in order to
do something to counteract anti-Rumanian propaganda.     The appointment of Mr Angelescu as Minister at Washington may do something to put before the American public the true nature of Rumanian aspirations^ which, judging from articles I have seen in the New York World and the New Republic and other papers, have been persistently misrepresented in the United States.16.10.17.
