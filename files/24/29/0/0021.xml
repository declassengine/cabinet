(THIS DOCUItiENT IS THE. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC HAJSSTY^S QQVBRNMSNT)c 521 E C R E TW A R     CABINE T. G.T.2321.CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.REPORT of the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet (246 Minute 1) to consider the question of the Conscientious Objectors, such Committee consisting of -Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman) Mr. Barnes, h.P.The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., Dr. H. A. L, Fisher, M,;;P. Mr. Iah Macpherson, K.P. Mr. Hayes Fisher, M.P.with Brigadier-General Childs, and . lir. Brace, M,P., in attendance.The main question for consideration is whether effect should be given to the request of Mr. Asquith that the cases of the &quot;absolutists&quot; should be reconsidered by the Central Tribunal, and that if their good faith is&apos; established to the satisfaction of that Tribunal, the men should be released and discharged from the Army,        This proposal is founded on the view that the fact that Tiiese men are prepared to continue in prison may be deemed pr:.ma facie evidence of the genuineness of their conscientious objections and may be taken to show, as to those men who have been refused exemption by the Tribunals, that the Tribunals came to a wrong conclusion.In considering this proposal it is important to hear in mind the position which ths men classed as &quot;absolutists&quot; take up.      They are nob in prison because they have a conscientious objection to military service, whether combatant or non-combatant *     Many of them have bean offered hy the Tribunals exemption for ell military service on condition of
\their undertaking approved work.of national importance, and nave refused exemption on those terms.     All of them have been offered release from prison on condition of undertaking non-military work under the Home Office scheme, and have refused the offer.    Their view is that by giving such an undertaking they would recognise the binding force of the Military Service Acts, and it is because they refuse to recognize those Acts as law that they have deliberately elected to remain In prison unless and until they are granted absolute and unconditionalI  exemption.     In short, it is not as conscientious objectorsIto military service but as passive resisters to the Military i Service Acts that they are suffering imprisonment.It appears to the Committee that to give way to such a contention would be to abandon the basis of the Military Service Acts and to sow the seeds of great difficul-ties In the future.      It would in fact be a surrender to anarchy and the recognition of the right of an individual to disobey a statute if he disagrees with it.There is also the practical objection that, if this indulgence is shown to the &quot;absolutists&quot;, the result must be to cause many of those who haT,re accepted the Home Office scheme (numbering over 3,000) to reconsider their position and probably to return to prison with a view to ultimate release.     And it is not improbable that many persons who have been given and have accepted non-combatant service in the ^rmy would take a similar line and their services might be lost to the country.
There is the further difficulty that many of the &quot;absolutists&quot; are now in prison either-&quot;because they have refused to L&amp;pply to the local tribunals for exertion or because they have declined to put their case before the Central TMbunal with a view to release under the Home Office scheme .   They apparently hold that either course would have, been an admission of the binding force of the Military Service Actsr   If so, it appears plain that these men would equally refuse to take advantage of the opportunity to have their cases reconsideredwhich is proposed to be given to themj and that even if they applied , they would accept nothing from the Tribunal but absolute exemption - which could har$ly! he. granted in every case .   The scheme would therefore not effect, the object which is desired.Lastly, it appears very doubtful whether effect could be given to scheme except by legislation .   The military authorities naturally decline to release a man from military service merely because he has committed repeated breaches of his military duties .   It has been suggested that the case might be met by allowing these men to apply to the local Tribunals under Section 4,(5)) of the Military Service Act 1916, ^Session 2)) for a re-hearing of their cases;: but,, as the above observations show , many of the men concerned would refuse to make sach an application, and in any case it is improbable that in the present state of public feeling the Tribunals would be more indulgent than they have been to claims of conscientious objection.   If legislation is required, it appears to the Committee that it will be impossible to pass it.    The sense of the hardship inflicted on the men who are defending their country by the exertion of these objectors fjrom military service has increased since the Acts were passed, and it would be practically impossible to pass through the House of Commons a measure giving them further reliefs
Having regard to the above considerations it appears to the Committee that the proper course is to uphold the law . But, as a sentence to a long term of imprisonment is undoubtedly; exceedingly severe, theie would not be much objection to a direction being given by the Home Secretary that conscientious objectors who have been in prison for a substantial period and have conducted themselves well should be brought under No.- 243 A of the Prison Rules, so that they might receive certain special indu1genees as to dress , books, visits, and 1e11ers , which may be allowed under that Rule.   As to the period of imprisonment to be served before these indulgences are allowed the Committee are not agreed, but they are all of opinion that it should he sufficient to act as a deterrent in other cases .Incidentally , the working of the Home Office scheme has been brought into question, partly by Lord Salisbury51 s Memorandum (G.T. 2167) and partly by the Jtetter of the Bishop of Exeter published in the &quot;Times&quot; of the 8oh instant. - The Committee do not think that it is desirable to amalgamate (as proposed by Lord Salisbury) the Brace and Pelham Committees .   The former deals with convicted persons, the latter with persons who are exempted from military service and have committed   no offence against the law.   But they think that the Brace Committee might,at least in the case of men who for (say); 12 months have worked satisfactor-ily in the Home Office, Centres , consider the question of releasing I them for national service outside, subject of course to properconditions as to work, abstinence from propaganda, etc.   If this were done, the objection to keeping so many offenders in associaticlwould be obviated; and an additional incentive would be given tomen working under the Home Office scheme to be well-conducted anddiligent in their work.-.Signed on behalf of the Committee .GEO. CAVE.Chairman16th October, 1917.
