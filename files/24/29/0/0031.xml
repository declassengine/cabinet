GENERA REMARKS.position in       In their very able Report, the Commissioners who outh Wales.      enquired into Industrial Unrest in Wales, commented onbethe mental activity which is a feature among the workers, and which manifests itself in an eager interest in politics. They identified tv/0 well defined groups, one consisting for the most part of the older men, which favours parliamentary action as a means to the attainment of its ends, the other, to which most of the younger men belong, which believes in &quot;direct action&quot; and holds the tenets of syndicalism and Guild Socialism.   They point out that the general outlook of all is narrow, ov/ing to defective education, such adult education as exists being avowedly extremist and political.Both industrial and -pacifist extremist propaganda have been exceedingly active in this area during the past three years, and little has been done to counteract the effort.   It is practically impossible to discriminate between the two movements.   The industrial propaganda is the work of. the Central Labour College (C.L.C), the pacifist of the Independent Labour Party (I..L.P.).   These organisations are in the closest possible touch, and both have made rapid strides throughout the period of the war. The former exerts its influence by means of adult classes on &quot;Economic&apos; subjects, - the economics being confined to : a study of the revolutionary dootrines of Karl Marx and his followers.   The teaching has for its avowed object the promotion of the &quot;class war&quot; in its most uncompromising form.   Any idea of general eduoational development is expressly disclaimed.The movement is not a new one, the CL.C having been formed in 1908 after the Ruskin College Strike.   Its activity has, however, increased very materially during the past two years and its limitations are fixed only by the scarcity of qualified teachers. It is reported that during the last week 100 nev; classes have been organised and the &quot;South tfales Pioneer&quot; anticipates that the coming winter will be, from this &quot;point of view, the most successful on record.The I.L.P. is exceedingly and increasingly active in pacifist agitation, and the number of its adherents is s^id to be rising at a rapid rate.   In mo t omlk/zv weekly pacifist meetings are held, addyceso&apos;] oy 1 , :-al speakers or by touring members of pacifist bo3l.?S.: Tn this work the Ihas the co-operation of bbe :T:i;.on of Democratic Control, the Council for Civil 1.1 her vie 3, the Women1s Peace Crusade, and similar organisations. They have tilled their ground methodically anO well, and South Wales has proved a fertile field.
The result is now apparent.   A powerful and vociferous company of malcontents has been organised, who, though still probably forming but a small minority of the industrial population, have, by their energy and enthusiasm, impressed the law abiding with a sense of their comparative weakness. The malcontents are hostile to discipline of any kind whether within or outside of their Trade Unions, hostile to their employers as such, hostile to tho war, hostile especially to the Government,This hostility has displayed itself in various forms apart from the pacifist agitation to which reference has been made.   Strikes and disputes, frequently enterod upon in defiance of their unions, are exceedingly common, and involve an average of probably 5000 workmen each week.   These are chiefly among the mining population, but the ferment has extended to other South wales industries and the N*U*Fi. and the Shipyard workers are only less disturbed than the workers in the mines.The agitation of most widespread importance was that for an advance of miners1 ?/agcs.   While this was in progress a grievance of a general character was discovered in the liability of tbe waqe &quot;earner to pay income tax.   The recent announcement of a concession to married men does not appear to have succeeded in removing the grievance, and it is now claimed that wages of manual labour, however liberal, shall be sacrosanct, a resolution to this effect having been passed by a conference of delegates from Miners1 Locoes on the 8th October.The most serious matter of moment at the present juncture is, however, the question of recruitment for military service.   The original scheme was received with the utmost hostility and was rejected by  36 votes to  5 at a conference of the South V/ales Hiners1 ?eder,.tion on iur**ust End.   The proposals were then withdrawn and new arrangements prepared, which have been accented by the Killers1 federation of Great Britain.    These arrangements were considered by tbe &quot;Conference of 8th October and a resolution passed &quot;that &quot;wre take no part in assisting in tbe recruitment of colliery &quot;workers for&quot;the Army&quot;.   Not content with this blank refusal, the conference subsequently resolved to take a ballot of all members on 1st November on the following reference:-    &quot;are you in favour of a down tools policy in &quot;South 5/ales in the event of the Government proceeding with their combing out scheme in the mines?&quot;Thase manoeuvres are largely the work of the extreme section who control the machine of the South Y/ales Miners1 Federation.   The billot will give the rank and file a chance which they rarely get Of5 expressing their views.It is believed that the ballot will result in a negative answer to the reference, but is is clearly desirable that the patriotic element, which is common^ stated to be, though not voluble, exceedingly numerous, should be stimulated and strengthened in as far as that is possible in the short time before the ballot is taken.   Much could be done in this direction by a series of public meetings and it is &quot;su^ested that the war Aims Committee mi.--ht usefully address itself
to the matter.   Should the &quot;ballot, in proja^anda, ^o in favour of a strike *the absence of suoh c. serious situation would&apos;arise.   It has to be rsmambered, however, that In this matter the attitude of the South Wales miners is not supported by the Miners1 Federation and is strongly condemned by &quot;large sections of it.   My weakening in the faoe of their threats to the State would have a disastrous effect.The Shop Stewards Movement,The National Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding Amalgamation Committee held a Hank and File Conference at Newcastle on the 13th and 14th October, of which a detailed and interesting report has been received,   -The \?rime movers were P. H. Kealey of Gorton, Manchester, and W. F. Watson,   The objeot of the Conference was to pass a resolution to tbe effect that if the executives of the various Unions concerned refused or negleoted to take action towards amalgamation, tbe Committee should immediately form itself into an Engineering and Shipbuilding Workers1 Industrial Union,Reports from local centres were conflicting, but on the whole disappointing.   The Conferenoe itself was a failure from the point of view of the promoters.   The draft resolution was not accepted, and in its place a va-&quot;;ue motion obviously intended to postpone a action towards amalgamation was carried.   An that the time for an Industrial Union was not defeated only by 50 to 42, in a meeting which himself described as the cream of the Revolutionary Movement.naoisxvemondment ri.?e was leyTho finanoial report of the movement was read,F, Watson.   It showed an income of  S8a. andexpenditure of  410 and a consequent (lefioit of IdO, Of the expenditure  18.3 was for propagandist literature.

II. PKE33 OPINIONSThe unfavourable and oritical reception of its articles has induced the &quot;Times to begin climbing down by stages in its leader of October 15th.   k few more extracts from labour journals may be given.&quot;Justice&quot; criticises the articles as being &quot;of the sensational and &quot;superficial type which has been all&quot;along assooiated with Hariasworth journalism&quot; and in the course of the article, - dealing with the allegations as to prooessions parading the streets, calling for cheers for Germany, or &quot;down with the English 5sar&quot; - it says:-&quot;In what large towns have processions gone along &quot;uttering suoh cries?   Surely we havent a*&apos;Bolo Pasha&quot;&quot;Hanging round Printing House Square to secure insertion &quot;of matter in the &quot;Times&quot; which the Pro German press &quot;will be delighted to reprint?&quot;The &quot;Mew Age&quot; places the responsibility for whatever revolutionary feeling that may exist at the doors of the men who have used the 7cr as a chance to swell their profits.The&quot;Herald&quot; makes an unconvincing attempt to treat the &quot;Times&quot; articles seriously.   &quot;These British Junkers &quot;are determined that the war shall be carried on,... &quot;They want to shut up every sorap of free and &quot;independent criticism.,   They cannot refute or answer &quot;the arguments of men like Charles Trevelyan and his&quot;friends.,...They appeal to the Government in the name of &quot;patriotism to suppress every newspaper that has the &quot;audacity to disagree with Lord Northcliffe and his &quot;satellites: andc.-.athese cowards, hiding behind the&quot;anonymity of the editorial&quot;we&quot;, make all kinds of &quot;malicious charges against men whose shoe latchets they &quot;are not worthy to unloose.&quot;&quot;Justioe&quot; alsc points out the articles in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in the I.    -7. are in the same class as these in the &quot;Times&quot;.   Its view of this body is summed up in the phrase &quot;Personally I consider the &quot;I.V/.V/. another turnip with a light inside.&quot;The &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; has been publishing a series of four articles on &quot;Clyde Labour&quot;, written by a correspondent who evidently has a thorough grasp of his subject and an intimate knowledge of internal conditions in that area. As to these the &quot;Herald&quot; says that the writer has on the whole &quot;stated the case fairly for the &quot;rebels, without calling for their decapitation&quot;.Sir Auckland Geddos1 speeches have met with &amp; mixed reception from the press, sind the various comments show that considerable difficulty is experienced in their interpretation.The &quot;Hew Age&quot; considers that he &quot;has put up a &quot;fairly good f i-:ht against the forces of capitalism &quot;which were hopeful of enforcing a scheme of national &quot;Service which in effect would be industrial &quot;conscription.&quot;/Toif ferment of Evolution11[lonalService
To the &quot;Leeds Citizen&quot; the speeches seemed to contain &quot;a good deal of &quot;promiscuous talking&quot;, of whioh a somewhat bombastic example Is quoted^ while the &quot;Herald&quot; asks &quot;&quot;That does Oeddes mean?&quot; and dohsiders that the question becomes &quot;the more unanswerable the more speeches &quot;the Minister of National Service makes.&quot;   The chief criticism is aimed at the statement that all men of military age snail be regarded ss &quot;Technically in the Army Reserve&quot; and be kept in civil life only by the State, presumably excluding the Tiibunal.   &quot;Thus in a sense the &quot;cat is out of the ba^ and Labour is not likely after this &quot;to be made happy by assuranoes that no industrial &quot;conscription is meant.&quot;The &quot;Call&quot; is, as might be expeoted, frankly hostile. &quot;It is a eareiully laid plot, first to review and marshal &quot;every form of labour from the position of those who depend &quot;only upon military victory; and secondly as a prelude to &quot;that regulation of labour so necessary for keeping the fip &quot;workers in their place when that &quot;good customer&quot;, the war,/ &quot;no longer a bfefBr in the market.   Sir Auckland Oeddee &quot;says that he will be no party to the introduction of &quot;industrial compulsion.   He is developing industrial &quot;compulsion.&quot;   tfith reference to the continued application the Restricted Occupations Order to aliens, it sayS:-is a deliberate attempt to organise and &quot;promote fa labour force, that could quite easily be made, incircumstances, a force strongly antipathetic io Labour.&quot;the most hostile criticism is found ini h3 xvou , whose labour correspondent ends hie on the National Service puzzle with the following&apos;of&quot;This labc &quot;present &quot;BritishCuriously,theartiole words:-it&quot;Horning Post&quot;,&quot;The general view taken in South Bast Lancashire is that the skilled men will be no better off under the &quot;new amendment si and there are many who thlnk^he will be geven worse off4   Few express any definite opinion on &quot;the scheme of Sir A. Geddes, for nobody seems to &quot;understand it and few seem to regard it with approval.&quot;vemment Control      The retrospective increase in the price of coal Cfcal has given rise to a critical position in certainquarters.   The &quot;Kanohester Guardiati&quot; reports that the impossibility of imposing an increased charge with retrospective effect upon consumers has led the Coal merchants in North Manchester to suspend business until their position is made clear*   The ^Newcastle , Chronicle&quot; voices the same difficulty, and poinis out the impracticability of demanding additional payment for small amounts sold to the poor since September 17th, the date from whioh the enhanced charge at the pit mouth becomes payable.wernment Control      &quot;OUstice&quot; welcomes the order permitting the Food adulteration of wheat flour with potato flour forthe purpose of breadmaking.The Yorkshire factory Times&quot; protests against the common oharge of  d for the paper in whioh the Sib/loaf
loaf is wrapped,   &quot;I say without fear of , &quot;contradiction that the ?ood Controller&apos;s price is&apos; &quot;aerate to enable the retailer to havo a reaonnable&quot;profit without calling upon the customer....to p&amp;y &quot;for a. sheet of paper fifty times as much as it coats, &quot;This is one of the ways in which the public is being &quot;robbed^ and there ought to be an ond put to it,&quot;Complaints of the inadequate representation of labour on Pood Control Committees continue,&quot;Justice&quot; demands a revolutionary policy in the matter of food production in order to ensure that sufficient is growin Great Britain to feed the whole population.   It points out that tho urgency of the question will not disappear with the war.jticisms of the &quot;She &quot;Gall&quot; draws attention to the arrest ofT-overnmenf        Private C,James Simmons, a pacifist orator.   The papersays:- &quot;v/e do not know the section of the Eing^ &quot;Regulations that will be emploj^cd tomprovifto a &quot;defence for this latest attempt to beat a common &quot;soldier into silence.   On former occasions...it has &quot;been Mr.Maopherson*3 habit to cite Paragraph 461. &quot;That section of tho Regulations cannot be quoted in &quot;justification for the arrest of Private Simmons inaos &quot;much as it applies with equal foroe and authority to &quot;Brig. General Page-Croft,M.P., the soul of the new. &quot;National Party, and a well known Tariff Reform speaksrtf Referring to the Advisory Committees now appointed by the Ministry of Labour in connection with Employment Exchanges, the &quot;Herald&quot; writes:-   &quot;The present proposals &quot;made by the Ministry of Labour are something, but &quot;they are not nearly enough....It is proposed to give &quot;theso committees only advisory powers, and to leave &quot;the bureaucrats entronchod in actual control.We*... &quot;are convinced that the bureaucracy can only bo broken &quot;if actual control is taken out of its hands...Trade &quot;Unionists will demand far more thorough-going ohangea &quot;before they relieve the Exchanges of their present &quot;burden of unpopularity.&quot;The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; comments on Mr-Lloyd GeorgCs promise of reprisals for air raids, and uses the incident as a tag on which to condemn all actions of war, alleging that the U boat campaign is simply retaliation for the blockade, and*tliat the action of Great Britain in &quot;condemning the women and dhildren of &quot;Germany to slow death by starvation&quot; is on a par with the killing of non combatants by bomb during an air-raid,   &quot;&quot;ve condemn the horrible and wicked atrocities &quot;of air-raids upon defenceless people; but we &quot;condemn if possible even more theoolossal atrocity &quot;of the war itself.&quot;&quot;The &quot;Cali&quot; endeavours to emphasise pacifist argument by the threat of more intense aerial welfare, &quot;One could understand the demand for reprisals If &quot;it were advanced as a means of putting an end to &quot;air-raids.   But the very experts tell us they will &quot;become a regular form of war, brought home to the &quot;people.   If they would escape this terror they must &quot;compel the Government fcb end the war.&quot;Reprisals
The pacifist agitation in South &quot;Vales in connection vith the miners1 resolution in the comb-out is dealt  .ith in . Section I.   The--&quot;Evening Hews&quot; prints an article /on the. subject.by iir;. James Meadov/s, a working miner, protesting &apos; against the resolution of:&quot;the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation on the subject, and containing the following:- &quot;..^..Is this &quot;decision a true reflection of the r.*elsh Collier?   Thank God, &quot;it is not.. - Any such conclusion must be nailed to the counter &quot;as a damnable lie.    It is the harvest of the pacifists1 &quot;methods..working through the machinery of the Miners1 &quot;Federation lodges in - South Wales, which V7ere long ago captur-&quot;ed by Socialist and Pacifist nominees-..,&quot;;7hen it is consider-&quot;ed that the average Welsh miner does not attend his Federation &quot;Lodge.,, whilst the Pacifist never misses a meeting;: it can &quot;easily be:seen how the compact entered into was negatived and &quot;a Down Tools policy sprung upon the Conference and. carried &quot;by the delegates, who uere largely Pacifistc&quot;   The seriousness of the position is also recognised by the &quot;Western Mail&quot; which welcomes the statement that the authorities are investigating ; the origin of the pacifist agitation and the source of financial assistance with which it appears, to be lavishly endowed.   It calls for: energetic action on the part of the Government and a patriotic rally on the part of all loyal citizens.The &quot;South Wales Pioneer&quot; is jubilant on account of the opposition at the War Aims meetings at Abercrave and Cwntwrch and voices its enthusiasm as follows:-   &quot;&quot;Then the majority !&apos;of our audience of 1500&apos; became hostile to a platform of &apos;?to &quot;the last drop somebody..elsefs blood&quot; speakers-   when tv/Q or..-&quot;three CO.&apos;&apos;3 put questions on.//ar aims which these wizen-faced, &quot;played-out fossils, failed, to-, answer: when an ordinary CO. &quot; openly. - challenged: a :&apos;7ar,&apos;.

The &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; thinks that &quot;there may be Bolos about,, just as there are Aleck Gordons &quot;....&apos;.But what all-the editors, Ministers&apos;, detectives and &quot;intelligence officers -know is that not an item in the Socialist &quot;propaganda we - have been carrying on regarding war and-- peace.has &quot;been paid for or depended&apos; upon any money except what was &quot;legitimately raised by friends in: this country.&quot;-&quot;Forward&quot; in an article &quot;Convicts and lunatics&quot;, in the -----manner of the &quot;Times&quot;, divides the nation into two classes, -. . oonvint, members-of the I.L.P, who have suffered for their convictions...and lunatics.   &quot;One half, the world has gone madv :-&quot;Society is. no-./, divided into two classes, actual and potential:, &quot;oonviftrts. and lunatics. &apos; And the.lunatics are in control.

&quot;cast it aside.   It is a matter ior serious consideration.&quot; &quot;Common Sense&quot; has a non-committal paragraph, pointing out that the proposals do not, as might have teen expected, include Tariff Reform.The problems oi Reconstruction are dealt with in a number oi Labour papers, most of vhich express suspicion of all proposals emanating from the Government or from the Employers. The &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot; discusses the activities of the Ministry of Pte construction:   &quot;This programme sounds &quot;alluring enough and I trust that good will come out of it. &quot;But let Dr. Aduison and his co-adjutors take care not to &quot;forget that the worker will want his claims properly &quot;acknowledging in any scheme of reconstruction they may evolve &quot;.......Cur worthy reconstructors had better realise at once&quot;and to the full that the Labour without which everything is &quot;useless means to have a better sha-re of wh$t it produces than &quot;it has had in the past.&quot;     The&quot;Leeds Citizen&quot; warns Labour that Capital has improved and strengthened its position for the after-war conflict and that Laboulr is unprepared.&quot;Labour......has done little or nothing as yet to mobilise its&quot;resources or to develop a scientific organisation or a plan &quot;of campaign.   To this urgent task it Bhoiiid at once address &quot;itself,,...&quot;   The Alliance of the Co-operative Movement with organised labour leads the &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; to look to that movement as the leading partner in a constructive policy of reform.-operation.        The important emergency conference of the co-operative movement to be heM in the Central Hall today (17th October) and tomorrow is referred to by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as an event of political importance which may prove to be as great as the Taff Vale judgment.   The article concludes:   &quot;If the &quot;projected co-operative candidates will but arrange wich the &quot;Labour Party to share the industrial constituencies between &quot;them, so as politically to combine forces in each case, they &quot;may together, conceivably, change the face of the House of &quot;Commons.&quot;   The importance of this aspect of the new movement is also emphasised by the &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times&quot;,   That the political side of the co-operative movement is now much the most active and important is clear, from a perusal of its weekly paper, the &quot;Co-operative News&quot;.   The issue for 13th October contains articles on &quot;Co-operators and ;7ar Emergency&quot;, &quot;Our Political Aims&quot;. &quot;Problems for Politicians&quot;, &quot;The British Bolo Scene&quot;, &quot;Is the Movement ready to take advantage of Peace11, &quot;The Peopled Rights&quot;, &quot;Restoiaiion of Civic Right Wanted&quot;, &quot;Co-operatOrs and the V7a*r Emer^encyConmiittee&quot;. Wore than half of the paper is now occupied by natter purely political and its tone indicates a probability that the journal may become a mouthpiece of the I.L.P.our and The &quot;Herald&quot; continues its campaign in favour of LabourJar.        representation at the Peace conference.    &quot;Labour must wake &quot;up, must let it be known by resolution from the Trade Union &quot;branches that Labour will discuss peace terms and is deter-&quot;mined that the peace, when it comes, shall be a peace of the u&quot;peopleTs, approved by the whole people, soldiers, sailors, &quot;and civilians alike&quot;.   &quot;Justice&quot; takes a nare   virile view: &quot;The dangerous minority which will not fall into line with the &quot;people and abandon class interests for the general and public &quot;interest will never be disposed of by the feeble, non-resist-Ting, carping, sneering, negativist methods lately illustrated I &quot;by the I.L.P., the conscientious objectors and their kindred.&quot;In the coming peace, quite as much as in the present war, the &quot;paltry and bourgeois moralising of the I.L.F. species will &quot;fail as miserably as Czardon and Kaisordom hav* failed.&quot;
london and South East111.   DISTRICT REPORTS.The-situationis on the whole quiet, though in some respects conditions are abnormal, owing to the movements of large numbers of workers who have been upset by air raids.This has particularly affected the clothing firms in the East&apos;&apos;3End of London who have lost many cf their workers, The Office Contracts Lepartment has made efforts to put the large numbers of machinists temporarily at Brighton to work but has achieved but little success.At Woolwich rumours are prevalent as to the amount of the coming increase in the wages of skilled time workers employed in the Arsenal.   It is said that this will by no means place the skilled time workers cn a level with the less skilled piece worker and it is expected that if this should be the case a large number of the men will leave their present work.Finfebury Park continues to be the chief centre of outdoor pacifist propaganda, though with bhe coming of the winter months the various organisations concerned are seeking oonveniont halls for their meetings.   Enquiries which have beon conducted do not indiocte that these /arious societies are possessed of ample funds.   On the contrary most of them, particularly the working class organisations are frequently very short of money and rely upon rich Quakers and others of similar views for financial&quot;support.1stElands.Conditions are normal, though, according to an officer of the Ministry of Munitions at Coventry the situation in that district is particularly difficult and much care will be needed to avoid serious trouble.   As it is there have been a series of disputes leading in several cases to. short stoppages of work.   At the moment there is treble over the tailing up of three Belgian workmen by their own Military authorities,;   Local employers are expecting trouble and loss of time to result from the withdrawal of the Leaving Certificate system.At Birmingham the too sedulous attention of the local police continues to be a cause of unrest.   Constables are apparently being instructed to call upon men who absent themselves from work and investigate their reasons for taing so.   The Birmingham Labour Party and-  Trades Council are aombining forces with a vie?; to preventing inter!erenct.The Treasury concession in the matter of income tax deal not eeea to have had mrsoh effect in this area,    any of tho. losal fmlnnff are supporting or are expected to support the Einars * federation.She situation is fvJM,  Ttaployars etnnplala/, of tfca ,rithdrwwnl cf laavlngoaertififfatea which they think will lead to asdleaa ixouhles/ Among the men thare is talk of Bahamas aaong tht employers to render the action of tho Ministry of Hanitjjcmaiin this affair mtaninglass, by coming to an arrsmgaosnt as ti employment among thenselvas.Prom Sheffield it is reported that the Shop Btawards hare acne to the *onclusi^ntthnt sectional strikes era a waste of strength.   They have accordingly determined to prevent them and to prepare the workers in all trades for a pMtod effort.Tho War Aims .0onmitteo appears  nite definitely to:have got tho upper hand over the pacifist bodies in Yorkshire.   These latter have never been able to gaics rmoh Impression and are now reported to bo concentrating their efforts on the woman workers with the object of Tising their politic strength at the next gm oral eleation.

North. Eastern.Scotland.settled (Sections 17 and ?),The Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades are anxiously awaiting the Committee on Production^ decision in regard to their claim for a revision of wages, meanwhile a great effort is being made to tackle the problems of non-unionist labour and arrears of Trade Union subscriptions.An agitation the object of whichto force all non-unionist workers to join a Union is becoming important throughout the Lancashire area.The situation in the shipbuilding yards appears to be distinctly easier, though there have been several small strikes in progress.   The chief trouble has arisen over an allegation by the Boilermakers at Blythe that the employers have been overstocking apprentices.   The difficulty was amicably arranged however.The War Aims Committee has held a number of successful meetings and the British Workers1 League has opened up a number of new branches in the district.   In addition to this tho Northumberland Minors executives have offered to send deputations to the local branches to explain the action of certain of their officials in supporting the&apos; Councils of Workers and Soldiers Delegates, and to submit themselves for re-election if following this there should still be dissatisfaction.- The important conference of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades is referred to in Section I. -The general situation in South Wales is described in Section I,       -  &apos;Conditions are normal,- though there does not appear to be any subsidence of, the unrest which has been noted as prevailing in - this area.- &apos; &apos; - ...

IV. - STRIKES.Only one impertant strike hasQoocurred during the past week, but this involved some 25,Q?;Q%6TiierB employed in the j^ncashire textile industry. The trouble arose out of the regulations of the recently established Cotton Control Board.   According to the pre-war practice one spinner who had charge of to mules would be helped by two piecers.   -:rith the outbreak of war large numbers of piecers joined the army and as a result the recent practice has been for a spinner to have but one piecer to help him.   This has resulted in particularly high wages, as the remaining workers get the benefit of the absent men&apos;s wages,   The regulations of the Control Board provided that 60$ of the machinery should be fully staffer.   This has meant two piecers to each spinner, with a consequent reduction of wages, and eventually on the 9th and 10th of this month a strike of large numbers of the piecers.   The strike covered a wide area with Oldham as the chief centre and many of the spinners having out of sympathy joined the piecers the number of workers actually on strike was 8,000.   This affected as many as 100 of the mills in the district.A deputation of strikers met the Trade Union officials on the 11th, and suggested that if the Control Board would withdraw their summonses against the men; they would return to work pending the investigation of their oomplaints.This led to a meeting of the spinners at Liverpool on Saturday, at whioh it was resolved to resume work on the Monday.   All the mills are now working, with the exception of two at Preston where there is some trouble over a question of wages.There have been a number of disputes Involving stoppages in h the Coal-mining Industry   The number of men involved must have been between 10,000 and 15,0^.0.   Several of them have however been settled during the week, notably the protracted trouble at the Gwaun-oae-Gurwen colliery In Glamorganshire.   The Coal Oomtroller&apos;s decision thai an earlier agreement should supersede the prevision of the Mnlmum Wage Aot was agreeable to the men, who returned to work on Monday last.   The settlement of this dispute involved the return to,work of the men at the Ammanford Colliery who had come out in sympathy.A dispute between two Colliery Enginemcn&apos;s Unions regarding &quot;poaching&quot; has resulted in stoppages at three Leicestershire collieries.   One of the Unions has refused to carry out an award issued by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.Mr. Vesey JCnox, K *0 * issued his av/ard in the case of the overlookers in the Ulster linen industry on the 10th inst., granting an advance of 9/- per week to men employed on or in connection with munition work.   It remains to be seen whether the employers will maintain the intractable attitude which they have adopted in regard to this arbitration.
rV. DISPUTES.The number of cases, reported by the Shipyard labour Dewtment again shows an increase; the number being no &quot;less than 169 as opposed to C149 for the previous week.   The increase is once more chiefly duelo unrest on the Clyde, whence 108 out of the total number are reported The number of these cases which were successfully settlefis Sven as 45 and the number which led to stoppage of work ^f^^^gj^g^On the Clyde restlessness is particularly   evident among the rivetters, and various difficulties in regard to rates on Standard Ships have occurred.The most important case of dispute ar$se over the alleged victimi-sation of Eorsyth a boilermaker employed by Messrs. Glover, Clayton and Company on the Mersey.   This man is a well known agitator   and there were various points of irregularity in regard to his dismissal which supported the contention of the men that it pbs a oase of victimisation. The Boilermakers, insisting on reinstatement, gave a weekrs strike notice, and it Fas with some difficulty that extreme action was averted. Eventually the Boilermakers1 Society offered to meet the employers at a* &quot;rounit table&quot; Conference, as a result of which it was decided that Forsyth should not be reinstated but that he should be paid three weeks wages.   The Boilermakers1 Society undertook to find him another position.This is the third case of serious  rouble   with the Boilermakers on the Mersey during the last three.months, and it has been suggested that the results of the work done by those of the Clyde deportees who took up their residence in that district are now beginning&apos; to make them-selves felt.An interesting case is reported from Norwich among the skilled men working atMessrs. Laurence Scott and Company., The skilled men have decided to strike on the 19th. as a protest against the excessive earnings of certain unskilled workers employed by the firm.The War Office Contracts Department   reported that tv;o cases out of a total of six in progress ha\re occurred during the week. The more important of these has arisen out qf an applies tion for increased wages put forv-ard by r-orkers in the basket trade.   All workers in Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands are affected and the point at issue has become rather complicated. Briefly the question is whether an offer made by the Employers1 General Association to the Yorkshire Backet Makers1 Union is to be held binding upon the other Unions, negotiations have been broken off, but the facts Of the dispute have been referred to the Chief Industrial Commissioner, and the Ministry of Munitions is also understood to be interested in the affair.The Committee on Production^ award in regard io the general application for an increase in wages   put forwarded by the United Garment Workers1Trade Union was issued on October 4th, it authorises an advance of ijrd and Id to male and female workers respectively.The whole of the Cutlery Industry is in an unsettled condition, due to the arbitrary attitude adopted by the National Amalgamated Union of labour in continually demanding large increases in vra&amp;es and in opposing the dilution of labour.The Coal Controller  reports that only two one day stoppages occurred, in connection with the. payment of the recent War 1 age Advance, In view; of the many: temporary difficulties created by the advance this&apos;: must be regarded as satisfactory. The extension of the T.&apos;r.r Tfar;e to  -members of the Miners1 Federation working elsewhere than in the ooal^ mines is;still under consideration.as 9. -
At -Walter Savage Limited (Peolcham) there was a short strike of packing ease makers owing to the refusal of certain female employees to join the Union.   It is bel&amp;oved&apos;that the union Officials were desirfcuasof taking the opportunity to compel the employers1 associa-.&apos; tion to agree to employ none hut union labour.   The men we rjs, however, persuaded to return to work.An important wages dispute between five wire working firms at Newcastle and the National Union of General Workers has oeen settled by agreement; and a strike of skilled men at Derby, on the ground that a  man had been called to the colours was narrowly averted.   This man was technically just outside the Schedule, but owing to the deep-rooted suspicion of the Government in&quot;regard to the recruiting which exists at Derby and indeed elsewhere, it was considered advisable to allow him to return to civil work and this was effected   just in time to prevent a   stoppage.An interesting case is reported from &quot;falkirk, where certain women workers stated  that the^ had received definite instructions from the Secretary of their Union, that they were not to do more than 60 plugs per day, until the matter was disposed.ofn. This would appear to be direct proof of a practise often alleged by the employers to occur and as frequently denied by the Trades Unions. It may be, however, that the officials of the womeife unions do not regard themselves as bound by any ,of the pledges   which have been given by the merfs1. Unions. Evidence is by no means lacking that they are not averse to unscrUpulour. action, if such would in any way further their aims.The Committee on Production   during the past week heard 15 cases in London.Three of these were in connection with the wages trouble among the Yorkshire textile workers (referred to.in previous reports) tho applications for increased war bonus were put forward by as many as eight separate Unions whose members are engaged in the woollen and worsted industries..; &apos; &apos; ;     B,J. 3K&amp;CELET0SFMINISTRY 03?
