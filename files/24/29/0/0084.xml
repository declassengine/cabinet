CIO.Special   iiemorandumTHE COSSACKS BEFORE AND SINCE THE REVOLUTION.II; Since the Revolution,In ICarch 1917 the Cossack troops in Petrograd threw in their lot with the revolutionaries.     Their action was immediately-endorsed by their fellow-countrymen of the Den, and the first proclamations of the Provisional Government were read to enthusiastic crowds in Novocherkassk.     The Acting Ataman of the old regime, Count Grabbe, was arrested together with his entourage and a Cossack Colonel was temporarily appointed Ataman.The Provisional Government Issued its first proclamation to the Don Cossacks on April 21, assuring them that &quot;the historic rights of the Cossacks to the land would re-main inviolate&quot;. Heanwhile it sent Voronkov, a Cossack member of the Duma, to act as its commissary and to settle all disputes until the Constituent Assembly met.     It was not long, however, before the bright days of the Revolution became clouded in the Don Province. Reports of disorders and the seizure of Cossacks1 lands became more and more frequent in Novocherkassk, and landowners began to bring their families into the towns.   It was in these circum-stances that the first Congress of the Don Voisko met at Novocherkassk on April 29,   The f^irst and the most burning question that had to be dealt with was that of the land.   So long as the Revolution was purely political in character there were no differences between Cossacks and peasants, but once it passed
from the political into the social stage the differences became acute oThe land question in the territory of the Cossacks is quite different from that of other parts of Russia.    In Central Russia the Idea of the common ownership cf land is highly developed, and since the Revolution has become an article of faith among the peasants.    In the Don Province - and the Don is typical cf other provinces occupied by the Cossacks - there is also common ownership of land, but it is confined to a class, and there is a clear line of demarcation between Cossack and peasant.     The whole land is the property of the voisko - the military organisation which corresponds for administrative purposes to an ordinary Russian Government -and is divided by the voisko in three ways.    Part of the land is assigned to the stanitsa (a group of villages) and is cultivated by small Cossack farmers, who, since Russiars frontiers have been extended, have abandoned hunting and plundering for agriculture. The next division of the land is that set aside to recompense distinguished generals or retired soldiers.     Land thus assigned to them becomes their private property, and many officers of high rank have now large estates which are spoken of as appanages. The rest of the land is known as the reserve, and it is this land which is rented to the peasants, who in numbers are almost equal to the Cossacks.   The rent paid by the peasants in the Don Province yearly brings in as large a sum as 1,200,000 roubles.     Under these conditions it is natural that the peasant should look upon tho Revolution as primarily a means of satisfying his land-hunger, especially when it is remembered that the average peasant allotment In Central Russia is from 10 to 16 d,essyatins per family (27 to 43 acres), whereas the average for the Cossack is 52 dessyatins (140 acres).     It is not surprising, therefore, that the Peasant
3, - i: &apos;Congress,.which met at Novocherkassk on Hay 31, should have demanded radical land reforms, though at the same time they volunteered their help for a peaceful settlement to avoid civil war between Cossacks and peasants.So long as the first Provisional Government remained in power the Cossacks had little to fear as regards the ownership of their lands.     Their ancient rights had been guaranteed to them in the first proclamation of the Government, and they had received assurances that social reforms should await the decision of the Constituent Assembly.     But with the collapse of the bourgeois Government and the appearance of a mainly Socialist Coalition, with Chernov as Minister of Agriculture, their fears were reused.   From this time dates tho steadily growing conflict between the Don and Petrograd, which culminated in the Kornilov affair and which at one time threatened to plunge Russia into civil war.It would be unfair to describe the Cossacks&apos; antagonism to the Socialist Government in Petrograd as merely dictated by their selfish economic interests;   their growing indignation with Petrograd was based on deeper and more generous reasons.   It cannot be denied,that the control exercised by the C.W.S.D. over the first Coalition Government did not help to counteract the growth either of insubordination In the army or anarchy in the interior provinces. The Cossacks, as the most compact and united force in Russia, resented keenly the growth of these tendencies and were prepared to act against any Government that proved Itself incapable of stemming them.     The growing disintegration cf Russia promoted a closer unity among the Cossacks, which was shown not only at the All-Russia Cossack Congress that met in June in Petrograd, but by the support given to the decisions of the Don Voisko by the neighbouring voiskos of Kuban and the Terek.
It is unfortunate that the activities of the Cossacks should have been suspected and misunderstood in Petrograd, for the unity of the Cossacks was in reality the surest defence of the Revolution. Cossack support of the Revolution was made unmistakable both at Petrograd and Novocherkassk.     Resolutions passed at the Cossack Congress in Petrograd spoke not only of working for a democratic republic, but of keeping in close touch with the C.Y7.S.D.       One of the representatives of the Yaik or Ural Cossacks declared that the bourgeois must understand that the Cossacks would not let themselves be used against the people.   They were ready, he added, to obey any orders of Kerenski.   Right up till July 1, the date of the Russian offensive, the Cossacks were giving their fullest support to the Provisional Government In spite of their intense dislike of Chernov&apos;s land programme.   On June 30, the day on which General Kaledin was elected first Ataman of the Don Cossacks (since the right of election was taken away by Peter the Great), the Cossack Congress in Petrograd declared that &quot;the Cossacks were ready to support the Provisional Government in its struggle with the foreign foe and with those who sow anarchy within Russia.       In restoring order the Government can rely upon the Cossacks and the Cossack regiments&quot;.The July offensive that opened so well and ended so disastrously produced a profound impression among the Cossack vciskos. Komilov&apos;s efforts to restore order were followed sympathetically, and pride was taken in the fact that the Cossack regiments knew no deserters.   As the Moscow Conference approached to?/ards the end of August, preparations were made at Novocherkassk to send deputies, whose instructions should be to defend the integrity of Russia, to support a Coalition Government, to insist on the reorganisation of the army, and to protest against the socialisation of the land.
These instructions are interesting as showing how both the economic interests and the military traditions of the Cossacks were now combined in resisting what they considered the dangerous policy&apos;of the Provisional Government.   Before the   disasters in Galicia the democratic forces in the Cossack Congress had made themselves felt as strongly as the Conservative, but from the time, of the Moscow Conference the Conservative elements, represented by General Kaledin, have spoken for all the Cossacks.The first open conflict between the Cossacks and the Provisional Government appeared at the Koscow Conference, where General Kaledin spoke in the name of the 12 voiskos - Don, Kuban, Terek, Orenburg, Yaik, Astrakhan,. Siberia, Amur, Transbaikalia, Semirechensk, Yenisei and Ussuri - but shortly before the Conference an interesting political agreement was made betv^een the Cadets and the Cossacks.   This was the first political step taken by the Cossacks.   It showed that, while claiming that they stood for law and order, they had no thoughts of political reaction.At the Moscow Conference Kaledin went even.further than Kornilov, and, not content with deploring the conditions of the army, did not hesitate tc formulate his demands on the Provisional Government.   By so doing he cut right across the compromise that Kerenski was at that time striving to reach with Kornilov, and incurred a public rebuke from Kerenski.   Kerenski afterwards explained to Bardizh, one of the most moderate Cossack members of the Duma, that he regretted that the Cossacks shouldlhave been represented by Kaledin, whose political opinions were those of the Right wing.   Had a representative of moderate Cossack opinion spoken at Moscow all fears of counter-revolutionary tendencies among the Cossacks - would have, been dispelled.Later events showed that Kerenski&apos;s suspicions of Kaledin were
greatly aggravated by the latter&apos;s conduct at the Hoscow Conference. On September 11, just after Kcrnilov had sent his ultimatum to Kerenskl) the Petrograd papers announced that Kaledin had thrown in his1 lot with Kcrnilov, and had threat&amp;ned to use the Cossacks to cut off Moscow and Petrograd from the south of Russia.   There is no doubt that both Petrograd and Moscow anticipated a rising of the Cossacks, and the Provisional Government took it so seriously that it declared Kaledin a traitor and ordered his arrest.   The Don Voisko Congress seems to have been taken by surprise.     It denied all the stories about Kaledin or any intended rising of the Cossacks.   Kaledin, It said, was travelling through the Don Province on ordinary official duties as Ataman and had made no attempt to incite the Cossacks to revolt,During the next week there followed a series of misunder-standings and explanations, so that even to-day it is difficult to knovir the whole truth.     From the evidence published it appears that false news was telegraphed to Petrograd about the movements of Cossack troops in the Don.   The Don Province itself is almost entirely agricultural, but on the east, west and south it is surrounded by industrial centres.     Tsaritsyn, on the east (on the Volga), Is one of the citadels of the Bolsheviks, and the C.W.S.D. there are bitterly hostile to the Cossacks. Tsaritsyn is an important munition centre.      Further south there is the sea-port of Rostov, while to the west are the coal mines of the Donets Basin,   Thus the Cossacks are surrounded by hostile centres where the local C.W.S.D. are in the ascendency.   It is not impossible that false news was deliberately or ignorantly sent to Petrograd from one of these centres.After some days of uncertainty, during which the Cossacks
7.refused to yield to the demands of the Provisional Government to give up their Ataman, Kerenski gave way,     The order for Kalcdinfs * arrest was rescinded, provided that Kaledin himself appeared at Hogiley to give evidence in the Kornilov affair..     For the present, acute differences between the Cossacks and Petrograd have vanished, and there is every hope that with the new Coalition Government they will not reappear.     At the same time the course of events has proved two things:-   (1) that the Cossacks form a compact block who will yield to no threats from Petrograd; (2) that the uniform land policy advocated by Chernov would inevitably lead to civil war.   The Cossacks still stand for the political integrity of Russia, bub they realise that in the future Russian Republic the old methods of centralised Government cannot be maintained.   Kerenski, who has declared himself in favour of the widest measures possible of decentralisation, will no doubt support the claims of the Cossacks to such administrative autonomy as will guarantee them their historic rights.24.10.17.
