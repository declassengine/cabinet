Colonel Jones    ^ lTHIS DOCuiMT if TEE ?\WBKXt&quot;OF HIS BRITiNalC &amp;ue3ty&apos;S GOVB^iENT.*?ar cabinet.EGRET THE elbcataon BILL.&quot;U?2?A- -----Memorandum by Mr, Barnes with reference to Dr,K.iL. Fisher&apos;s Report en his Educational Tour (G.T.2370).I desire to say a few words to my colleagues in support of MriFisher^s Memorandum as numbered above and to suggest a declaration being made by the Government which would satisfy those who are interested in the Education Bill above all internal questions.I have had communications from many in the Labour move-ment recently, as well as from &amp;r.Mc&apos;Tavish, the Secretary to the Workers&apos; Educational Association.     I have also been in contact with Church people on the matter.   I addressed a meeting of the Church of England Menfs Society in Kent a few weeks ago, presided over by the Bishop of Rochester and sub-sequently the Bishop wrote to me that he.had.circularised all his Diocese in favour of the Bill,     Since then I have seen the Archbishop of Canterbury and had assurances from him that the Church was in favour and would see the Bill through.    A de-putation has been here from Scotland, representing the Trade Unionists of Scotland and they Hell me tha&quot; the feeling is very strong in favour of a Scotch Bill.   The Bill for Scotland has not yet been framed.     Great hopes had been entertained respecting Vr. Fisherfs Bill,In the circumstances, of course, it is now generally recognised that the Bill cannot be passed this year and I think most reasonable people, however much they desire the Bill passed, would console themselves on the loss of the Billthis/
this year, if the Government would take an early oppor-tunity, by a statement in the House or elsewhere, tointimate that it was their intention to pass it into lawearly next year.If, however, that is done, I hope also that it willbe made plain that Scotland is to have a Bill at the sametime.     Scotland id ahead in regard to Continuation Schoolsand provision of many things lacking in England and %les,but still they want, 1 know, to keep their lead and even toincrease it and it would give great dissatisfaction ifand Walesa Bill were passed for England/and nothing done at the same time for Scottish Education.G. N. B.29th.October 1917, 2,Whitehall Gardens S   11
