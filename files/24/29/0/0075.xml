30In ti el 1- igenc e. Eureau,Department of Information.CEV/026.WEIKLY RESORT GK RUSSIA. XXV1.(October 23, 1917).Tbe Ge^rmar^pjffensiye^and^ the Politieal Situation.The only event cf outstanding importance during the last week has been the capture of the whole. Gulf of Riga by the Germans. The military and naval importance of this event   lies outside the province of this report, but from a political point cf view the consequences are not likely to be so serious    as they were in the case of the fall of Riga.     At that time there was nc stable Government in Petrograd and the &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; movement under Kornilov was almost ripe.   Thus any important military event could not fail to have serious political consequences.    If the Germans continue their advance from the east coast of the Gulf of Riga there may he further political developments, such as another Kornilov movement, but at present there is no sign of this.More likely than any &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; movement on the Right is an attempt by the Bolsheviks to overthrew the Government. The Bolsheviks, whose official leader is now Trotski, undoubtedly owe their increasing influence to the vacillations of the Government. They have a cut-and-dried programme that seems to the masses to offer some relief in the present intolerable conditions, while the Government must necessarily be very slow In introducing economic reforms, because, being a Coalition, they have many conflicting interests to consider.     It is to the interest of the Government, therefore, to hasten, by every means in its power, the summoning of the Constituent Assembly.     The Importance of the moral support of the latter is more and more clearly realised, for the new Provisional Parliament is-, only partially representative and, if
boycotted by the Bolsheviks, will run the risk of getting out of touch with the masses.   The period that has to be tided over by the Government is only about 6 weeks, as the elections have been fixed for November 25 and the Constituent Assembly will meet on December 13*The chief danger, however, at present is not political but economic.      Pears of an economic collapse are becoming more and more real, and many peo^ple doubt whether any Government can find a remedy so long as the war lasts.     At the same time no political party would favour   the conclusion of peace for two main reasons:-(1) The economic consequences of demobilisation would be disastrous, A large hungry army suddenly released would commit unheard-of excesses.    (2) Russia cannot afford to make peace when at her lowest, as she knows that any peace terms now would be at her expense.The Spread of Anarchy.The spread of anarchy is clear from the last batch cf Russian papers that have reached this country,   llore and mere space is being given to local riots and the forcible seizure of land accompanied by all kinds of excesses.   These disorders are spreading from Western Russia as far as Tashkent.   The latest news from Tashkent in the Russian press of October 6 speaks of the ascendency of the Bolsheviks there, much to the disgust of the Kohammodan population.     The Government has sent the General-in-Command of the Kazan garrison to restore order, but as the telegraph office is now in the hands cf the Bolsheviks communications have been interrupted.Further West in the Caucasus conditions have also grown v;orse. This is one of the results of the Kornilov movement. The. failure of the Kornilov movement has placed the Bolsheviks in
the ascendency in the Caucasus, and the Revolutionary Committees that were established to fight the counter-revolution refuse to be disbanded in spite of Kerenski&apos;s orders.   The presence in Tiflis of Tsereteli, Chkheidze and Chkhenkeli, all of them former members of the Duma and moderate Socialists, may do good, but the conditions they have to fight against are by no means encouraging.In considering the significance of the growth of anarchy in Russia it must be remembered that Russia can stand more than most countries, if only because she has never reached the same high state of organisation as Western Europe.     Ead, therefore, as conditions are, it would not be safe to prophesy that a collapse will come during the winter.   The Russians have&apos;an extraordinary power of enduring what elsewhere would be considered impossible conditions.   With the moral support that the Constituent Assembly will provide and with constant encouragement from her Allies, Russia may well continue to act on the defensive and hold up the German armies well on into next year.The Bolsheviks and their Prospects.The Bolsheviks are now the only political party openly hostile to the new Coalition Government^ and they are prepared to fight for power.   Whatever may be their chances of success (though it could only be temporary), there is no doubt they are increasing in numbers and influence.   They have captured the Sovyets both in Petrograd and Moscow, and amongst the working classes generally their plan of campaign is more attractive than that of the Coalition Government.    It may be argued that Kerenskirs previous Government is itself to blair-e for the increase
cf the Bolsehviks, as it only played at reforms.    It Joutlined numerous programmes of reform, hut owing to fear of breaking up the Coalition between Cadets and Socialists little or nothing was done,    In the eyes of many Socialists the price paid for the success of Kerenski&apos;s policy has been a dear one,   There are some Socialists who consider that the present failures are directly due to the slowness with which the Petrograd Sovyet got to work. They maintain that if the Sovyet had accepted full responsibility last March, and had controlled the first Provisional Government, It might have consolidated the Revolution before the subsequent military and economic disasters occurred.     But once having let their opportunity slip, and having let the Government follow the line of least resistance by postponing difficulties through fear of offending vested interests, a purely Socialist Government became impossible.     According to this line of argument Maximalism - I.e, a purely Socialist Government introducing its programme of reform at once. - was only possible at the beginning of the Revolution;   after seven months1 vacillation its temporary success would only involve the country in civil war and bring back reaction.- If this be the case, it is obvious thst the duty of all moderate Socialists is to fight the claims cf the Bolsheviks to the death in the Interests of their country and of those very Socialistic ideas that they stand for.     There may not be an open struggle between the Government and the Bolsheviks before the Constituent Assembly meets;   if there is it will probably be provoked by the latter, as the obvious policy of the Government is simply to carry on as well as it can until it reaches the Constituent Assembly.     It is probable that the Government will -avoid provoking a conflict, but will attempt gradually to free itself from Sovyet influence.     The removal from Petrograd to
5. : - -:.&apos;oscow will &quot;be a step in this direction.    It will he vigorously opposed &quot;by the Bolsheviks, as the headquarters of revolutionary Socialists is in Petrograd.     For   some years past the -underground work of revolution has been concentrated in Petrograd, Kronstadt and Helslngfors.   Although the Sovyet in lioscov is strong, there is nothing like the same revolutionary organisation in what will probably become the new capital of Russia.The Nationalities and Decentralisation.An interesting Congress of the Nationalities of Russia took place in Kiev towards the end of September.   Nearly all the chief nationalities were represented, the leading part being played by the Ukrainians, who Initiated the Congress.     Professor Hrushevski, the President of the Rada, made the chief speech.     He said that tho desire for federation had permeated the Ukrainian people, and he considered that the idea of federation played just as important a part in Russia in averting disunion as it did in the United States.     He emphatically denied that the Ukrainians looked on federation as a stepping-stone to separation.The representative of the Provisional Government read the following message from Kerenski:-   &quot;Tell the Congress from me that Russia can only be decentralised&quot;.     Kerenskfs own ideas for the future of Russia are further explained in an interview he gave recently to Cossack representatives:   &quot;Personally I am in favour of wide federation and think the constitution of Russia should be that of United States with local diets and parliaments&quot;.The result of the Kiev Congress was the formation of a standing Council of Nationalities, which will elaborate plans for a federal democratic Republic.   These plans are to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly.     If the Radical Democrats and Moderate Socialists secure a majority in the Constituent Assembly, it is
probable that the principle of federation as outlined by Kerenski will be adopted.   Russia cannot easily be governed in a uniform fashion, as she1 contains so many degrees of civilisation, and any attempt, for example, to force on the Cossacks the same social reforms as Petrc^grad might welcome would only lead to strife and bloodshed.   If economic questions and the maintenance of order are to be the main problems of the Government both during and immediately after tho war, the Central Government may well seek to delegate its authority to provincial or national Diets that are more In touch with local conditions.23.10.17.RAL.
