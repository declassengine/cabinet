(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)Intelligence Bureau,SECRET.Department of Information.C 9.    (October 20).Special   MemorandumTHE COSSASKS BEFORE AND SINCE THE REVOLUTION. 1,   Before the Revolution.There are two Institutions in Russia, which no amount of association with the West has been able to destroy, the village mir or commune and the Cossack voisko or military community. Both of them have suffered from the attacks of centralising Tsars and meddlesome bureaucrats, but they have survived, and preserved their ancient characteristics.   The mir, based as it is on the principle that the land belongs to the people and should be owned by the people in common, represents the ideas of the peasants of Central Russia.   The Russian peasant Is peace-loving,&apos; and has no military traditions;   his first thoughts are for the land that belongs to God and to the people.   Very different are the tradi-ticns of the Cossacks,.   Though they are for the most part peasants of Central Russia by origin, they have not been able to possess their lands in peace.   The lands they now possess were won after years of struggle, and, when won, needed a standing army to guard them.The earliest mention of the Cossacks is in the 15th century. The word Cossack is of Tatar origin, and, in its proper form, means &quot;freebooter&quot;, for the Cossacks lived not by trade or agri-culture, but by hunting and plundering.    In the 16th century theyspread along the steppes of both Eastern Russia and of the Ukraine.    In the East runaway serfs from Central Russia and others who courted adventure moved across the steppes as far as the river
Don, where they halted and occupied the flat and fertile lands of the present Don Province.    In the 16th century the Voisko of the Don Cossacks was formally recognised by the Tsars of Moscow, who saw in these turbulent and warlike subjects a useful defence against the Turks and Tatars of the South East.More interesting, however, is the early history of the Cossacks of the Ukraine, for, situated as they were between Moscow and Poland, they played a part in international politics.   They too were by origin peasants, who crossed the steppes to escape from the tyranny of their masters.. These peasants of Little Russian race had lived contentedly under the rule of their Lithuanian and-Russian masters, but with the union of Poland and Lithuania Polish administration began to penetrate into the Russian provinces of the Ukraine, and Polish administration meant the introduction of the Polish szlachta (Polish gentry), in whose eyes It was no greater crime to kill a peasant than to kill a dog.    In self-preservation the peasants fled into the boundless steppes of the Ukraine, until they,arrived at the lower courses of the Dnieper far beyond the reach of the szlachta.     In their ne?; homes they were exposed to the constant attacks of the Tatars, and were forced to form themselves into a military community or voisko.   This voisko, founded In the 16th century, was known as that of the Zaporogian Cossacks, as they lived in the islands of the Dnieper &quot;beyond the rapids&quot; (za porogi).   Once settled in their new home they developed their own form of Government.     They elected their own Ataman, who held office for a year, and they brooked no inter-ference from foreign rulers.   The ties with Poland became looser (* and looser, though it was not uniil 1654 by the Treaty of Pereyaslav that they were formally broken, and that the Ataman
j^-v, Cbmielnicki came to terms with the Tsar of Moscow.   But this Bogdantreaty, though it freed the Cossacks from Poland, brought them under still more powerful rulers, and after an abortive rebellion under iiazeppa, who joined Charles XII of Sweden against Peter the Great, they were slowly bu  surely deprived of their autonomous rights. It was not until the reign of Catherine II that the Zaporogian Voisko vras finally abolished, and its members dispersed.     Many of them became simple Ukrainian peasants, amongst whom, the Cossack tradition is still powerful; v;hile others withdrew further East and formed themselves into the Kuban Voiskc, east of the Black Sea, where they occupied themselves in constant struggles with Circassian tribes.The Cossacks of the Ukraine were not alone in revolting against Peter the Great, the first Tsar who attempted to bring the outlying provinces directly under the Central Government.     The Cossacks of the Den also rebelled, but they were far too useful to the Tsar, as guardians of the eastern frontiers, to be treated with undue severity.     Their independence was curtailed by the withdrawal of the right to elect their own Ataman, who henceforth was nominated by the Tsar.      In addition to this  the administration *   of the Voisko was placed directly under the Central Government; otherwise their military organisation remained intact.   Though since that time the Cossacks have loyally served the Tsars on many a battlefield both in Europe and Asia, their treatment by the Central Government has always rankled in their breasts.     They have complained that, vhen Russia was In danger, they were called upon to help, while, &quot;hen Russia was strong, they were ignored.The Don Province is rightly regarded as the home of all Cossack tradition, for it was from the Don that all the later voiskos were formed, save that of Kuban, which still prides itself on its Ukrainian ancestry.     Towards the end of the 16th century
Yermak, with a small hand of Cossacks, crossed the Urals into Siberia and drove back the native tribes.    He then offered the new territories to the Tsar of Moscow, who gratefully accepted them.   The band of Cossacks who&apos;followed Yermak was supplemented by others, who formed the nucleus of the first Siberian Voisko.The extension of the Russian frontiers by the conq-uW- cf Western Siberia, in the 17th century led to a rapid development of the Cossack Voiskoa.     The achievements of the Don Cossacks had impressed the Tsars with their value as guardians of the frontier,  and efforts were made to increase both their numbers and their duties.   New Voiskos were formed both in the north east of the Caucasus In 1586, known as that of the Terek, and in the Urals (on the river Yaik) in 1591.     Later in the 18th century the Voiskos of Orenburg and Astrakhan made their appearance. Meanwhile in Siberia the Cossacks had rapidly been spreading eastwards.     During the 19th century their conquests had extended so far that the Siberian Voisko was enlarged and divided into several branches, and the existing Voiskos, of what are loosely known as Siberian Cossacks, include those of Amur, Ussurl, Transbaikalia and Semirechensk.The part played by the Cossacks In Russia&apos;s development as a great power both in Europe and Asia has been of such use to the Central Government that under the old regime every effort was made to keep them distinct from the rest of the population.       The administration of the Don Voisko was so devised as to preserve the military qualities of its inhabitants.     The province was put under the Ministry of War, not the Ministry of the Interior as the other governments of Russia.       The Acting Ataman (this was his title before the Revolution when the Tsarevich had the title of Ataman) was responsible to the Minister of Far;   other-
wise he had the same administrative powers as an ordinary provincial governor.   The civil administration closely resembled that of other provinces, though the nomenclature was different. The voisko was divided into a number cf okrugs or districts and stanitsas, the Cossack equivalent for the Russian volost or group of villages.The chief difference, however, between the Cossacks and other Russians was in the question of military service. . Unlike the rest of Russia where military service is enforced by means of a selective draft, every Cossack between certain ages is liable to military service.     Those who are unfit have to pay a contribution to the funds of the stanitsa.     The rest have not only to perform a longer and more arduous term of service than the ordinary Russian peasant, but have to provide their own horses and equipment. Where a Cossack is too poor to pay these expenses he is assisted by the stanitsa which sets aside funds for this purpose.     On the other hand they are free from direct taxation and own more land than the ordinary peasant.     The object and indeed the result of these regulations has been to form the Cossacks into a special caste and to keep alive the military tradition.    Its unfortunate side is that in the new democracy, where castes are abolished, it makes the relations between Cossacks and peasants somewhat difficult and strained.Peasants and Cossacks have many conflicting interests,both social and political, but the fundamental difference is the difference of tradition.     If a conflict is to be avoided it is .for the peasant to understand and appreciate the tremendous power of the Cossack military tradition.    He has no longer any ground for fearing that the Cossacks can be used again as in 1905 as the agents of reaction.     This war has been one long education in
revolution for- ereory ola.sa- :btvRus^and the Cossacks are now as good revolutionaries as the Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Deputies.     &quot;Nobody&quot;, said General Kaledin at a recent meeting of the Cossack Congress, &apos;*who had lived;through the year 19i5 in the army could ever desire the return of the old regime&quot;.     It was the treachery of the old regime that aroused the old military tradition of the Cossacks and made them revolutionaries, and it is only treachery that will turn them against the revolution. Although Cossack troops were used against the Revolution in 1905 the Cossacks themselves were not reactionaries.   The members they sent to the four Dumas, men like Karaulov, Voronkov and Bardizh, were all prominent in the ranks of the Opposition.       The Cossack soldiers have drunk deep of the revolutionary spirit and mai y of those stationed in Petrograd have not remained deaf to the doctrines of the Extremists.   But deep down in their hearts the old tradition has remained, alive.    At a rscent meeting of the Congress of the Don Voisko at Novocherkassk a resolution was passed condemning those Cossacks who had fallen victims to the teaching of the Bolsheviks and excluding them from the ranks of the Voisko.     After ti resolution representatives of the disgraced Cossacks who had come from Petrograd asked for a hearing.   They had come, they said, to beg forgiveness,  as their conduct had been unworthy of Cossacks. In the face of the whole assembly these men, who had been false to their tradition, shed tears of shame.Such a tradition cannot be roughly treated or ridiculed by the revolutionaries of Petrograd.     The Cossacks are not their enemies, but they will suffer no one to trample on what they hold sacred. &quot;We have never been serfs&quot;, said General Kaledin at Moscow, &quot;but have ever been free and independent.     We are not drunk with freedom;   what we desire is freedom combined with order&quot;. 20.10.17. RAL.
