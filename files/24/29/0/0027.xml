SECRET.7CLEAR THE LIKEOperations. .4 From-. General Ballard, Roumania,To:     C.I.G.S., War Office.17th October, 1917. Handed in 1.40 p.m.B.A. 749,Finlayson has just returned from a tour of artillery of 1st Roumanian and 6th Russian armies.     He has a very high opinion of the Roumanians;    all available artillery mater-ial is properly used and well cared for;   personnel are well-disciplined, smart and well trained.     Map work, camouflage and all arrangements for barrages, etc., are very good.     He also saw the 611 howitzer battery, which arrived in Roumania only four weeks ago;    it is now complete in horses and personnel, and the training is so good that they are fit to go into the line;   there is also personnel ready trained for another battery as soon as the howitzers arrive.     He also visited two divisional artillery schools where the training and spirit were excellent.     His opinion of the Russians, on the other   hand., was very (?poor), and worse than in other Russian armies he has seen.He suggests, in these circumstances, that any available guns would be now better employed with Roumanians than with Russians.     The Roumanian reserve divisions possess no artillery, and as these reserve divisions may have to protect the Roumanian flanks if the Russians give way, it is most essential that they should have artillery. I hope that in view of the above you will use all endeavour to get for this country more guns mobile medium howitzer.
