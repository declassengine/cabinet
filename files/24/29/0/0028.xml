D0CU1UHT IS TiC PRQZhUY CP HIS irJT^IO ,UJ2SgY&apos;S G0V3PJi^3HTC H 3 ?, 715   C A. B I H 32, T.-: GBHMAff   P2AC5  iOTgSI&apos;Admiralty Memorandum for the T.7ar Cabinet.In connection with tho efforts which are being made in the German Press to direct German, public opinion as to the possible Peace Terms which might be acceptable to Germany, the Director of the Intelligence Division calls attention to an aspect of the question-which may not perhaps be fully appreciated by Germany&apos;s enemies.He points out that at ihe present time Germany has about 170 submarines In commission and a similar number under construction.     At the end of 1918 the enemy will thus possess a fleet of between 250 and 350 submarinesi and if peimitted to retain such a fores at their command, a peace based on mere adjustments of territory will be an incentive to further aggression on the part of Germany.   When peace is concluded the Allies must necessarily fall apart, and being engrossed in reconstruction problems are unlikely to bo in a position to come to the aid of any one of them that may be menace d.He also points out that the principle aim of the German Peace Movement at present appears to be to ensure her economic future, and that if after the war she is dissatisfied with her economic position she could suddenly launch any submarines she may then possess against the commerce either of one nation or of the world-, with a view to achieving her commercial aspirations.
He suggests, therefore, that it is of paramount importance that the war should he continued until such time as the Allies are in a position to render impossible such a manoeuvre on the part of Germany.The First Sea lord agrees that while Germany remains in possession of a large fleet of submarines there is no guarantee of security^Note by FIRST IGRP,I appreciate the difficulty of dealing specially with submarines in any peace discussions which may take place, but it seems clear that a fleet of Submarines offers peculiar opportunities to an unscrupulous foe who might wish to take an old and hated enemy unawares, and this country would seem to be particularly vulnerable to such an attack on the part of Germany.     The retention by Germany of a large fleet of submarines would be an added menace to any peace concluded before the complete military defeat of the Central Empires is achieved.The point is one which I think it well the Cabinet should have specifically before it.(Signed)   S. GJ5DDSS.18th October, 1917.
