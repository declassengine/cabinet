Intelligence Bureau, SECRET..-   - Department of Infnrrrx:ti^n.FIW/015.Weekly Report on Italy,    XV. (Oct. 2.5th,  1917)The Situation in the Chamber.The Italian Chamber reassembled on Oct. 16th.    Boselli&apos;s opening speech was cf n general character and contained no declarations regarding&apos; the questions of pressing interest viz. the recent crisis in the Ministry; the resignation of Signer Canepa, the organisation of Pood Control, the ?apal Note, etc     L Socialist Deputy at once rose to protest, accusing the Government of &quot;insufficient respect for the privileges of Parliament&apos;;   and an open vote was demanded on a motion for immediate discussion of the recent crisis apart from and before the general discussion on the Vote of Account.     Boselli opposed the motion and made it a question of Confidence.     The voting gave the Government a substantial majority (51 *.yes to 228 Noes); but the general opinion seems to be that the. Government was to blame. A large number of these who voted against the Motion only did so because they did not wish to see the Government defeated unheard on a question of procedure (and on a Socialist motion). The incident is regarded as having weakened the position of the Government.The sitting of Oct. 17th was only noticeable for a speech from Labriola (a Publicist of some prominence, attached to the Reform Socialist Party) who condemned the Government mainly on two grounds. (1)   The increasing tendency to delegate its civil powers to the military authorities:    (2)   Foreign Policy.     On the first count he complained of the recent extensions of the military zone and contended that the Government was not worthy of its name of &quot;National&quot;, since it showed itself to be actuated by a distinctly conservative and
d3s.reactionary prejudice.     This prejudice was meat obticus in the case cf the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom the speaker accused cf net &apos;understanding the ideal requirements of the war&apos;.     There had been rumours of a Secret Treaty concluded by the Minister   during his visits to      Paris and London for a permanent Alliance with France and Great Britain.     The sneaker was all in favour of an alliance after the war but all treaties ought to receive the sanction of rarliament and the   Allies of Italy must know that no agreement could be recognised as valid by the people of Italy which had not first received the   assent of the Italian Parliament.Sonnino here interjected that no such agreement existed.The speaker went on to find fault with the Minister for backing up the dynastic policy of Montenegro.     This was to make ccrimen cause with Austria.     On Dec 21, 1916, King Nicholas telegraphed to Francis Joseph a request for a separate peace to which Francis Joseph sent a favourable reply;   moreover Prince Danilo had for a month previously been negotiating the surrender of Montenegro.Reg^aJding the Jugo-Slav questions the speaker said that rit would be impossible for the world to believe in the justice and sincerity of Italy&apos;s claims against Austria if Italy showed that she was pursuing designs of imperialistic expansion in Dalmatia at the expense of the Slavs and In &quot;the Eastern Ionian at the expense of Greece&apos;On the 18th a violent attack was made on Bissoloti:    (partly in his capacity as representative of the military authorities and Cadorna in particular) by a notorious Giolittian deputy (Grosso-Campana) backed by the Socialists.     Bissolati retorted with vigour (f.nd. acqused Grosso-Campana of having encouraged the Socialists at Turin from a safe distance in the rear.     In reply tc r: Socialist he
5.&apos; &apos;1declared roundly that &quot;in order to defend the Army from attacks in the rear I would open fire on you all&quot;, a declaration with which presently Signor Orlando declared his entire concurrence.     To an attempt on the part of GrosserCampana to compliment Bcselli for his moderation and to differentiate between Ministers, Boselli replied by arising from his seat and demonstratively shaking hands   with Bissolati.\7hat was made clear by the proceedings of the first three days of the Session is (1) that the Ministry mean to stand or fall to-Lrether (2) that the Socialist party really intends to back up the newly-formed Giolittian and Glerical group and assume for its own purposes its &quot;Defence of the Constitution&quot; attitude.     The numbers of the new group are said to heva increased tc over 100.     Its professed programme is tc champion the defence of Parliament and cf civil liberties generally against the reactionary invasion cf the interventionists and against the Government, so far as it identifies itself with reaction.     The real object of the movement is probably to test the feeling cf the Chamber - to provide a rallying-point for all those who fear militarist reaction and an indefinite pro-longation of the war more than a compromise with Giolittism.     No prominent Giolittian has so far allowed his name to appear on the list of the group&apos;s members- and all intention of forming a distinct party is disclaimed.     That may mean that the movement is only tc be acknowledged in case it obtains sufficient success in the Chamber. The group advertises its intention of demanding a reduction from 4 months tc 2 of the period for which the Vote on Account is asked, in order to insure the more frequent summoning of Parliament.     The same demand appears in the programme of the Official Socialists.     It is noted as significant that the only papers which speak kindly of the group are Arantj. the Corriere d&apos;Italia, the Popolo Homano &amp; La Stampa,

The numbers of the new group are said to heva increased to over 100.     Its professed programme is to champion the defence of Parliament and cf civil liberties generally against the reactionary invasion cf the interventionists and against the Government, so far as it identifies itself with reaction.     The real object of the movement is probably to test the feeling of the Chamber - to nrovide a rallying-point for all those who fear militarist reaction and an indefinite oro-longation of the war more than a compromise with Giolittism.     Ifo prominent Ciolittian has so far allowed his name to apoear on the list of the grouo&apos;s members and all intention of forming a distinct party is disclaimed.

Taken in connection with the recently reported presence of German troops in considerable strength on the Isonzo front and the offensive opened on Oct. 24th in the region of Tolmino, which, we are informed, w/as deliberately timed to take place soon after the meeting of the Italian Chamber and designed to bring about the fall of the Boselli Government and to precipitate revolution in Italy, the situation in the Chamber is most serious.If as seems highly probable, the Boselli Government is thrown out,the alternatives are (1) a Giolittian Government relying for support on pacifist elements including the Official Socialists and pursuing a policy of compromise and oeace-by-negotiation with an anti-Etitish and pro-German animus and determination to restore as soon possible economic relations with Germany, (2) A Ministry pledged to a policy of &quot;Thorough&quot; both on the external and internal fronts -which may easily precipitate a Revolution. Prospects of Italo-Serbian accord.recording to a telegram received by the Secolo (Oct. 16th) from Saloniki, M. Basic, in a report which he had presented at Saloniki to &quot;rince Alexander and the Serbian llinistry on the results of his visits to Paris, London and Rome .-nd cf his conversations with Allied Ministers, especially Scnnino, hed expressed himself ^s hopeful re-gurding the conciliation of Italian with Serbian aspirations.     The question had net been raised of modifying, existing agreements cither between Italy and the Entente Powers or between the Serbian Government and the Jugc-Slav Delegates.     nevertheless the impression formed during the conversations, which had been conducted throughout in the f most friendly tone, was that an accord betv/een Italy and Serbic. was possible .     At the same time it &apos;ms recognised th**t no definite settlement;could be roachel until tho military operations had reached
a more decisive stage.     The Sccclo&apos;s correspondent gives these im-pressiQiis cn the authority of &apos;one of the most prominent among Serbian diplomatists&apos;.Greece.The Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Lord Granville that the French and Italian Governments have come to an agreement on the question of evacuation in I?.. Epirus.     The French are to evecuate Sandraporos and three other villages to the East of the Liaskovic-Hersek line (on the road from Janina to Eoritza), the Italians- oritza, Molitzka and Kasianieh (further South, near the river Ycyusa).    The Italian military occupation of the triangle guarding the Santi Quaranta road is to be maintained, but the. Hellenic Civil administrs-tion of this region is to be at once reinstated.The French have offered Italy sole control cf Prevesa as an Italian naval zone under ultimate command cf the French Commrndor in Chief.   &apos; Lord Granvillc is informed that the Italians will   ccept this offer.25. 10. 17.
