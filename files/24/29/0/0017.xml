15 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC WLS&amp;SWS GOVERNMENT. VS.E0R EjTeG. T.-2317 W A g_OA 3 1,1 SI,BILLS DEALING TvITH PROPERTY DISTURBEDReport by Sir E0 Car3aa in accordance with War Cabinet 247, Minute 6,The War Cabinet on the 9th October; 1917, requested me to examine the subject of Bills dealing with various kinds of property disturbed by the war-.,, with a view to advising whether such questions should be dealt with by one Bill or a series of Bills.Two Bills appear to have been drafted and considered(1) A Bill to amend the Defence of the Realm (acquisition of land) Act; 1916.(2) A Bill to make further provision with respect to the requisition of ships in connexion with ths present war.Both Bills are, in my opinion, necessary.   The question whether they should be introduced separately or be consolidated into one Bill is purely a question of Parliamentary convenience.. I think, myself, that it is better to introduce them separately.. They deal with different subject matter of acquisition and different tribunals for assessing compensation. If they are . introduced separately, there will not probably be a joinder of forces between those who obiect to this proposed method of assessing compensation for (1) Land, (2) Ships.There is a third case raised and sent to mo as to the order under the Defence of the Realm Act relating to the requisition of beans, etc and referred to in Cabinet Minuto of the 2nd October 1917.   The proper course in that case 13* I think, to validate the order by Act of Parliament and not to Include the matter in either of the Bills to which I have referred,.(Initialled)     E..C,2 Whitehall Gardens., S.W. 16th October, 1917.
