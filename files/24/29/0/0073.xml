Eroia - Hilitary Attache, Petrograd, To     - D.H.I..Petrograd, l9&amp;h October. 1917.No, 1421,I ear; Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day.    Russians are taking out one Corps in 4 from front line in order to train in rear for li months.     The 2nd Guard Corps, which has been sent to Podoliflth to train, has looted spirit stores and is &quot;burn-ing and pillaging.     There are now 43,000 officers unemployed. Some of these are to be appointed to Corps brought back for training.A delegate from a division on the Roumanian front appeared last night before the Soviet and said that his division would conclude an armistice with the enemy if the Government did not do so.     Staff work in the north is impossible, as units   debate orders for half a day before obeying.     In this way troops sent from Haps^al^ embarked too late to be of any use in Bsel. The Minister of Foreign Affairs thinks the enemy is determined to get to Petrograd this year, basing this view on the sizt of the naval force he is employing.    He thinks the Russian Baltic Fleet will be knocked out and Reval will be turned from the south oast,     Though it would take the enemy li months to march from Reval to Petrograd by land, this fleet might appear off the capital in 3 weeks after Reval was captured.    Minister of Foreig Affaire said that he is convinced that Germany is determined to have peace before Christmas, and is risking everything to improve her strategical situation before opening negotiations.     General Cheremisov, who commands the north front, imagines that the Germans will move on Pskovg,     It seems remarkable that the German designs should be so ambiguous that in the past fortnight they have transferred 5 divisions from Riga front to France. It is possible that 1 German division may have been transferred , from the Riga front to France during the last fortnight, but there is no information that any others have been transferred. It is known that 1 German division lias been moved from the Western to the Eastern Theatre during the last fortnight,**5^?&apos;    The Military Attache, Petrograd has been asked&apos; to give the numbers of the divisions which he reports to have been transferred.4* Podolia, a province north east of Czernovitz,jS Haps&amp;al, port on jJsthonian coast, north east of 3sel island,5 Pskov a town half way between Riga and Petrograd.

No 1422.

To-day I saw Savinkov late Minister of War. He blames Kerenski entirely for the disastrous results of the Kernilov affair. He says that here till the Sevyet in Petrograd has been got rid of nothing can be done. He thinks that Kerenski having lost all support from the right cannot last long, and a Government will then be formed by Tseretelli and Avksentiev or one by Chernov. He hopes by Chernov, for such a Government could not last a week. The deciding factors in Petrograd are the Cossack Regiments. They will not move against Kerenski but would against Chernov. The Presbrajenski regiment was bought by the supporters of the Kernilov revolt.

? Chernov, extremist of the Lewin type, now leader of the Bolsheviki.

  Tseretelli a Georgian by birth is the leader of the Menshevilli or more moderate party.

? Avksentiev is a Socialist and at present  Minister of Agriculture.

* The Preobrajenski Regt. is the first regiment of the Guards.
