(jm Document is^a^BE^^BOARD. Off AGRICuXTul^^AljD^yiSHBRIESS.   ,. Re port ^ f qr^ 8&apos;j^finAe d ^ 24th Oct otter,    1917 .388The work of the Board on both the agricultural and the fisheries side proceeds in the main on lines indicated in recent reports.     The following is a brief account of &quot;the Board-s new veterinary laboratory vhich has just been completed and handed over to the Chief Veterinary Officer.Surrey,The new Veterinary Laboratory at New Haw, Addle stone, for the investigation&apos;of animal diseases ha,-,   new beentaken over and work is in progress there. The buildings are not yet quite completed, but the available accommodation is alreadymuchsuperior to that of the old premises.     The transfer fromthe old&apos; premises to the new was effected without a hitch.Up to 1905 the Board possessed nothing in the nature of a laboratory for veterinary work and research, only thing approaching such an institution wasUntil then the the scullery of 4,Whitehall Place, which was used for the examination of the internal organs of disease! animals.     This place was none too sanitary, and became a nuisance.in hot weather.     Specific information, upon scientific problems had tc b-s obtained in those days from outside veterinary sources, and usually prove! unsatisfactoryu     Whenever a general subject had to be investigated, the Board was obliged to set up a special committee, - a costly and wasteful method, as upon each occasion it was necessary to find a fresh equipment, which had to be sold at a sacrifice on the completion of the enquiry. Then in 1905 a committee was appointed to investigate Epizootic abortion, an improvised laboratory was set up at Sudbury for thatjur&quot;g03eThe bulk of this inquiry being undertaken by the Board,1 sChief Veterinary Officer, it was arranged that the general laboratory work of the Board should also be done cn thy Sudbury premises.rentThis general work increase! .oo greatly that the Board decided to a house near by (Alperton Lodge), where the Committee on abortion were able to finish their work, after the 3 years5 lease cf the Sudbury premises had run out.     Thanks to a concession made   ,&apos;-by the Treasury it was possible to retain for the Board1s use all apparatus in the hands of special committees at the close of their work, and in this way much useful apparatus has been acquired for the laboratory which would otherwise have been sold at a loos.     The alperton premises were frequently visited by persons of importance interested in agriculture, but eventually these premises were condemned as inadequate by Mr, Runeiman and Lord Lucas, and, a grant of  28,, SCO having been obtained from the Development Commissioners for the purchase of a site und the erection of a proper research laboratory, the present buildings were put in hand.The buildings stand in 40 acres of agricultural land,and three railway stations serve the districtThe architect,Mr. Pyice, has not taken any previously existing institutions of the same kind as his model,.     The laboratory has been planned rather to vsuii the requirements of this countrys while avoiding the faults of Similar institutions &quot;in other parts of the world.     It is probable
It is probable that no better laboratory of its kind exists anywhere, although many such institutions have cost considerably more-     The ground floor contains the rooms for the laboratory and general scientific work,   - On the first floor are the rooms for office work, the museum and the libraryi-     The roof is planned to serve as a store room.     In addition, besides the main building, there are a large post-mortem room, operating rooms, cold storage, mechanical apparatus \Scorns, housing for animals, destructor house, food preparing&apos;room, carpenters1 shop, dispatch room, a mess room and two cottageso     Special piggeries and a serum making plant, sanctioned after the main scheme, are new nearing completionoWhen the new laboratory was decided upon, provision was made for a special researoh staff, including three pathologists, with special knowledge of baoteriology, helminthology and poultry diseases respectively, to assist- the director.     Owing to the war these appointments have not been made and the staff has been mainly occupied in routine work in connection chiefly with the diseases which were scheduled under the Diseases of Animals Acts;   but such time as can be spared is devoted to ressaroh.     The Board is responsible for the diagnosis throughout Great Britain of diseases suoh as anthrax, swine fever, foot and mouth disease, rabies and glanders, and much of the routine work of the laboratory is connected with theseo     Anyone interested in stock may come to the Laboratory fov reports and advice on the diseases jf their animals.*     The privilege is freely taken advantage of and questions are often asked in connection with contagious diseases which are not scheduled under the Acts but which must not be disregardedo     The progress of researoh itself adds to the routine work, for when the experimental stage has bean passed and definite knowledge acquired the y/ork can be passed on to the routine staff to handle, in a systematic manner^     The research work is by no means confined to the four walls of the laboratory, but is extended to farms where certain diseases prevail.     A gratifying feature in this connection is the growing readiness of farmers to put their animals at the disposal of the Board for purposes of experiment.The field of research is unlimited, but attention is naturally paid first to such diseases as are most to the fore at a siven time*     An institution of this kind is especially valuable for investigations of a long and continuous character without the prespeot of much profit or glory at the end.     Investigations are proceeding upon two diseases of sheep known aa &quot;louping ill&quot; and &quot;ecrapie&quot; upon which progress reports have already been published.     It is hoped that it may be possible to investigate the diseases caused by internal parasites in poultry and domestic stock, which have proved very iestructivec     Results of considerable practical importance have already been achieved through the activities of the laboratory staff. Notable among these is the work that led to the campaign against contagious abortion by inoculation.     The old practice of endeavouring to stamp out swine fever by the crude method of slaughtering is being replaced by its treatment by serum, a method whereby over  30,000 a year has been saved since the war began, and whereby a &quot;further saving of  15,000 to  20,000 a year may be effected In the future^     The new installation for making the serum will render it no longer necessary to purchase       the material from abroad and will thus save the country about one half of the  8,000 at present expended on serum, or more than enough in one year to pay for the entire cost of the&apos;plantoThe new premises are also well furnished for general educational purposes.     In addition to the museum, the library is supplied with a projection apparatus and a cinematograph, affording
excellent&apos; facilities for illustrated lectures to farmers1 clubs and agriculturists in generals     It is proposed in the future tc develop this means of instruction, not only in the laboratory hat outside at various district centres where disease may be prevalent.Secretary*26th October, 1917.3c
