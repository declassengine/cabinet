(THIS TOCUl-IZiKT .13 I1IE PROPERTY OF hi a ^RlT^alC MAJESTY 1 a GUVJiiKJ^BMj,.()g.t. - 2392.380MR CABINET.- -THE ORDER OF THE BRITISH. ENTIRE.Report by the ?.arl of Crawford   .and Baicarres.In&apos;accordance with the War Cabinet Sol, Minut$ 16, -I beg leave to state that I have examined the documents relating to the Order of the British Empire, and I have conferred with the Committee which reported on September 28th. ( See G-.T.2290).Many complex and delicate problems arise on which I shall send a subsequent report, but I desire to invite an early decision on one or two matters of urgency.In order to have names ready for the coming Sew 1ear53 Honours list, it is necessary to establish in a general manner the total number of decorations to be conferred, the percentages to be allotted to various services, and the number of gazettes into which this total will be divided. JUntil these decisions are taken it is impossible for Departments to make their proposals.     It is specially important for the Foreign Office, India Office, War Office,, and Colonial Office to receive their instructions forthwith,  in order to allow adequate time to communicate with their Departments- abroad.     Even for public Departments at home the time available is short.I find there is     general agreement among those who have given close and protracted attention to this subject, that there should be five classes and that the following bread subdivision should be made.		I	tt	inFor	U.K.	100	3co	1,20bFor	Dominions	-25	75	300For	Crown Colonies	CO.	25	100For	India .;	12	35	150For	Allies	50	150	 00IV	V4,000	6,000l-,000	1,500330	^00&apos; 5OO	7502,000	3,060*These figures oxclucle     a sixth section of Medallists.-The number therefore is large, - upwards of 22,000, but modest in comparison with the numbers conferred by Continental Countries.
7 Audley Square, 25th October, 1.917.These figures can of course-he reduced, or they can,he spread over a long series of gazettes.     For the moment,however, I submit to the Cabinet1.       That Departments should be authorised to proceed on the assumption that the total shall be divided among four hall yearly gazettes, beginning 1st.Jan. 19l8.     One.fourth therefore of the total would be available for the coming List.2,       That Departments which cannot recommend their quota, should be entitled to carry forward the balance of their allotment.3.       That the War Office and Admiralty be authorised to make such distribution of their respective allotments between civilians and combatants as they may think advisable.The allocation of numbers between the variousDepartments at home is now being examined.     As regardssanction to those Departments which have to communicateabroad, the matter is so urgent that,  should the Cabinetagree to the foregoing proposals, I suggest that authority toact should be conveyed direct to the four Departmentsconcerned,(Signed)    CRAWFORD Sc. BALCARRES.
