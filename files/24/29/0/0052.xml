(Eolonel Jones.0 WAR CASIET .Corri^cndun to G.T. 2352.In lines three and four of the second paragraph the ^ords &quot;Pood Controller&quot; should read &quot;Director of Food Production&quot;.(initialled)   M.2, Whitehall Gardens, 24th October,  1917.
This Doctcment is the Property of .His Britannic Majesty^ Government),,.18*gJSjP BET. G.T. 2352.WAR   CABINET.FOOD     PRODUCTION.(Memorandum by Lord Milner)Has net the time come when the Cabinet should call upon thebriefIfood Production Department for an immediate/but comprehensivestatement of the progress being made with the programme of increasedfood production ?    We are now in the very middle of the ploughingseason.     The need of more arable land is greater than ever it was.The time during which an increase in the sowing of corn crops,especially wheat, can still be effected, is drawing short.     Ifthere is anything which we can yet do to promote the carrying outof our programme, or to remove obstacles to its execution, thenecessary steps should be taken at once.It may not b6 necessary to have a formal report, in fact itmight be only a wq&amp;te of time to call for it.     What I suggest isthat the President of the Board of Agriculture and the S1e-dtir&apos;CGn-t^olia-r should ba asked to come and see tho Cabinet at some veryearly date, to report personally on this matter, and to put beforeus any suggestions they may have for speeding up.     I am aware thatweekly reports are circulated both by the Board of Agriculture andthe Pood Production Department, from the careful perusal of whicha fair general impression of the progress of affairs may be culled.But, in the enormous mass of this periodic literature which we haveto read, it Is always possible to overlook points of importance, anddifficult to carry in one&apos;s mind from week to week a completepicture of any particular situation.     I do not believe this matterhas aver been mentioned at the Cabinet since the sittings of June27th (W.C.170) and July 13th (W.C.184) when most importantresolutions were taken.     We ought surely to know hov? far those resolutions have been carried out.   I think a brief interview withthe persons principally concerned would be very instructive, andmight at this juncture be most useful.(Initialled)   M.19th October, 1917.
