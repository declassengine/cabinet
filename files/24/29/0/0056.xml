&apos;This Document is the Property 0fReport for Week ending Wednesday, October 17, 1917.. PART . I, ACTION  TAKEN.: Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The following Orders have been issued during the week : (1) Tbe Potato Bags (Returns). Order, 1917, dated October loth, 1917, requires all .persons owning potato bags, whether manufactured by themselves, or not, other than bags which will not hold more than half-a-cwt., to furnish to the Food Controller on or before October 29 returns showing the bags owned by them at the close of business on October 22nd. The Order does not apply to stocks of bags which on October 15 did not exceed 1,000. -The Order is preparatory to a scheme for relieving the shortage of potato bags which has arisen from the restrictions which have been in force upon the import of jute. The Food Ministry proposes to acquire bags for the War Office and to distribute them to the potato trade in accordance with the information obtained from the returns now required to be made.(2) By the Currants and Sultanas (Requisition) Order, 1917, dated October 13th, 1917, the Food Controller takes over all currants and sultanas now afloat and shipped to the United Kingdom. The prices to be paid are left for subsequent determination. Returns of all currants and sultanas affected by the Order must be made before October 20th.,,; (3) The Beer (Prices and Description) Order, 1917, dated October 15th, 1917, fixes maximum prices for the sale in public bars of beer of two qualities, viz., beer of an original gravity less than l,036o and beer of an original gravity, not less than l,036o and not exceeding 1,042&amp;. The price for the former quality is 4cL and for the latter 5c?. per imperial pint. The restriction of price applies only to sale by imperial pint in a public bar,- but a supply of beer at the maximum prices is secured by the provision . that beer of the original gravities mentioned may not be sold in anypart of licensed premises unless it is simultaneously on sale by imperial ; pint at the maximum prices in a public bar on such premises.   The term &quot; public bar &quot; includes any place where beer is sold for consumption off the premises.   &quot; Licensed premises &quot; do not include registered clubs,- canteens, theatres, music halJs, passenger vessels, railway restaurant cars, or buffets at railway stations.   .Enforcement of the Order is secured by provisions requiring brewers to mark the appropriate price upon casks of beer affected by* the Order, by prohibiting defacement of such marks or dilution of beer by retailers, and enabling samples to be taken for analysis. The Food Controller may modify existing contracts under which sale of beer at the fixed prices.would not allow a reasonable profit to the retailer.&apos; J The Order prohibits the use in connection with beer of an original gravity less than 1,036o of any form or method of description calculated to lead to the belief that such beer is brewed under the authority or directions of the Government or any Government Department.(4) The: Intoxicating Liquor (Outfit and Delivery) Order, No. 3, 1917, dated October 15, 1917, permits, under specified conditions during the current . quarter, the brewing by accepting brewers of 20 per cent, increase standard barrelage over the barrelage otherwise permitted under theA   (33)4075-3   Pk 1   60   10/17   E &amp; s A
Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, 1917, dated March 29th last, and permits a further T3^ per cent., such increase for allocation by the Food Controller to brewers supplying necessitous munition areas.(5) The Tea (Provisional Prices) Order, 1917, dated October 17th, 1917, fixes a maximum price of 4s. per lb., to come into force after October 31st, 1917, for tea other than teas classed as Class A, Class B, and Class C teas under the 90 per cent. Tea Control Scheme, 1917. The latter teas may only be sold or disposed of as permitted by that scheme.&apos; The Irish Food Control Committee receives power, subject to the direction of the Food Controller, to vary the above price of 4s. per lb.Control of Supplies and Prices.Allied Purchases. The first meeting of the Inter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive was held on Tuesday, October 16, at 12 o&apos;clock.Mr. Brooke, Com. Attolico, M. Destombe and Major Monfries, C.I.R., were present.Procedure was arranged, and it was agreed to secure figures for estimated require-ments at the earliest possible date, for the purpose of sending joint instructions to Mr. Owen Smith.: Bacon. It has been decided that American bacon is to be handled by the agents of American packers only. It is possible that as a result Danish importers maybe put out of business. The importers commission has been fixed at 2 per cent, with a maximum of 3s. per cwt.The maximum price of lard has been raised by 6s. to 130s. per cwt.AU importers have been asked to make a return of their 1916 imports as it is intended to base the distribution of bacon imported by the Government on the 1916 figures.;      , , .&apos;. i &apos; -The Treasury have been asked to agree to this Ministry selling at a loss as it cannot buy at the present maximum prices.The purchases to date amount to about 800,000 boxes valued at 2,800,000/-. No actual arrivals are reported.. A Maximum Prices Order and schemes of distribution have, been further considered.- , Dried Fruits-The quantities of currants and sultanas requisitioned under the new,Order are estimated at 1,400 tons currants and 1,200 tons sultanas. It is intended to distribute these to the War Office, Navy and Army Canteen Board, and Manufacturers engaged on Government contracts.Action has been taken through the Foreign Office in order to induce the Portuguese Government to remove the prohibition on the export of figs. Meanwhile in order to obviate American competition in. Portugal, arrangements are being made with Mr, Hoover to refuse import licences for Portuguese tigs into America.Feeding Stuffs-A further meeting of the Central Feeding-Stuffs Advisory Committee has been held, at which the personnel of the 40 Provincial Feeding-Stuffs Committees was arranged. ,      .A Sub-Committee has been set tip to discuss and recommend maximum prices for cattle cake. It has been decided. that millers&apos; offals, brewers&apos; and distillers&apos; grains, and maize bye-products must be included under the scheme of control.v Jam and Fresh Fruit-A. General Licence has been issued authorising all persons selling jam or jelly wholesale for delivery to any place in the Orkney or Shetland Islands, and all persons selling jam or jelly by retail within those islands, to charge an additional \d, per lb. for jam so delivered and sold in excess of the prices authorised by the Jam (Prices) Order, 1917.Meat.-A model scale of maximum retail meat prices, and another of maximum wholesale meat prices, for the various joints and cuts of meat, were issued to the Local Food Control Committees and the &quot;meat markets respectively in London and theBome Counties on October 11th, to obtain until October 27th.Milk.-An Order is being prepared, which it is hoped may be issued so as to become operative on November 30th, prohibiting, the sale of. cream except to invalids. . ...
:!-&apos;--! Oil Seeds. Efforts are-being made to arrange with shipping companies that the Allies may get a proportion of their requirements direct from our Colonies, but these arrangements cannot be completed until Inter-Allied negotiations have made further progress. It is hoped to purchase a considerable part of the South American linseed crop, in conjunction with the United States of America, in order to alleviate.the Oils and Fats situation in this country.Oils and Fats. Arrangements are being continued with manufacturers for increasino- the output of margarine in this country; the equipment of the necessary refineries is progressing, and questions of priority as regards building, plant, and raw material are being dealt with.Sugar. No loss of cargoes has been incurred during the past week.In the course of the week a telegram was received by the London Exchange Committee from Messrs. Hope, Amsterdam, re-opening the negotiations in regard to a purchase of. Java sugar, and offering on behalf of the Java Sugar Trust 150,000 tons at the Commission^ price and conditions.This offer was promptly accepted, and, provided the necessary freight can be provided, as tho Commission has reason to believe can be done, the supply for this country is now assured up to the end of February.By March the new Cuban crop will be available, and future supplies can be drawn from that quarter. ,i At the end of last week the Commission^ delegates to the International Sugar Committee left for New York.Tea. Progress has been made with the discussion of the scheme for the wholesale distribution when tea is imported on account of Government.An endeavour is being made to equalise the distribution of the available quantit3T of tea by dealing with excessive stocks. But the quantity of tea in the country is unusually low, and as, so far, consumption has not decreased, there is a serious shortage in many places.The Shipping Controller has been asked to arrange for the export from India and Ceylon of 25,000,000 lbs. of. tea monthly, besides&apos; the quantity required for the Army and Navy. In addition he has been asked to provide for the export of 17,000 tons of tea spread over October, November, and December. It has been ascertained that 36,503,326 lbs. will be shipped in October. Steps are being taken to facilitate the handling of tea at Liverpool and Manchester.Cold Storage and Inland Transport.Gold Storage.-This section was. originated in the middle of August, 1917, its objects being :-(1) To ensure that sufficient cold air storage is available to take care of all food . requiring this particular kind of storage, estimated for the consumption of the population of the United Kingdom, and that this cold air storage shall be so,distributed as to provide for the most economical and best method ., of handling, the various commodities.(2) To arrange an organisation for the prompt transportation of all food stuffs (imported or otherwise) from the ports or places of origin to destination.Since that date, all ports in the United Kingdom have been visited, in order to visualize the actual position of the cold storage accommodation in the country ; it was found that 30,000,000 cubic feet of cold air space was available, and it was decided that this accommodation should be increased by 10,000,000 additional cubic feet of space.Only in two cases were extensions proposed by private enterprise, the principal one, representing,an addition of 1,920,000 cubic feet,.being made by the Port of London Authority. ... -It then became necessary to see what arrangements could be made for a further increase of 10,000,000 cubic feet, on the best possible terms; the position at. the moment is that 6,887,000 cubic feet have already been arranged for, at a cost of 784,0.00/,    ;    ... , j: .... ,:.:;;vr,,; v.        , ... .
This expenditure of 784,500Z. is made up as follows :-			Cubic Feet.	Expenditure.Partial private enterprise       -      -      -      -Government assistance by loan......

Representatives of this Department have been appointed to (leal with cold storage and railway transport at Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Hull and Bristol; arrangements will also be made for representation in Ireland and probably in the Midlands ; the representatives are attending meetings of the railway companies so as to lose no time in dealing with food stuffs as they arrive at the ports; the representatives at Glasgow and Liverpool have been particularly useful in dealing quickly with refrigerated cargoes, and thus enabling ships to be turned round without delay.Questions of transport generally, both as regards rates and charges, and also actual fonvardings, are also being dealt with.Enforcement of Orders.The whole question of the- enforcement of Orders by the recently constituted Food Control Committees has been under consideration, and it has been decided that concurrent powers to enforce and to prosecute in cases of all Orders of the Food Controller are to be given to these Committees as well as to the Local Authorities. Such power already exists as regards the police under Regulation 56 (11) of the Defence of the Realm Regulations. It has been decided that the Committees are to utilise the existing legal machinery as far as possible, and for this purpose the Home Office have instructed the Police to give every assistance, and the Local Government Board are instructing Local Authorities.Sugar (Registration of Retailers) Order. Several heavy fines have been imposed, especially at the Thames Police Court, where on the 10th instant, 17 grocers were fined in sums aggregating to over 1,000Z., under Article 2 of the Order for making false statements in regard to their stocks of sugar. In these cases the Medical Officer of Health, Stepney, was specially atithorised by this Ministry to prosecute. At the Old Street Police Court, on the 15th instant, a grocer of Spitalfields was fined 50L under the same Order for a similar offence.Sugar (Domestic Preserving) Order. Numerous cases have been taken up under this Order but this Ministry has advised Local Authorities and the police that it is not desirable to pursue cases in which small amounts of sugar have been actually used for the making of jam. Prosecutions have been instituted in some cases by Local Authorities for false declarations under Article 5, but it is generally understood now that such a charge cannot lie if the application for sugar was made before the 11th June, the date of the Order. A contravention of Article 5 of the Order is, however, established if the sugar was actually acquired after the above date.Potato Orders. Heavy fines continue to be inflicted upon farmers who have sold potatoes at illegal prices. At Spalding, where the famous case of Thompson was heard, another farmer, R. Twell, was lined 2u0Z. on the 16th instant. Two potato merchants, J. T. Way, of the Midland Potato Market, and Messrs. Ley.and Son, of Swansea, were fined 100Z. each and costs for buying potatoes at illegal prices.   These
.   PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.There are two things which call for particular attention.1. The movements of stocks during the autumn and early winter.It will be seen that in this as in previous years a fall sets in after the harvest is garnered. The reduction of stocks of wheat during September was very nearly the same in 1915, 1916 and 1917 ; but of barley, maize, and oats together the reduction during September 1917 was 100,000 tons less than in 1916. The imports of cereals are 200,000 tons lower. It appears that there has been a considerable economy in consumption.2. The heavy decrease which has taken place in the imports of the principal foods since August.The imports during the first eight months of 1917 and of 1916 were almost exactly equal. During the last six weeks, however, 1,026,000 tons were recorded as compared with 1,460,000 tons in 1916. The great part of this reduction is accounted for by cereals, but the importation of meat and bacon during these weeks has been little more than half the amount in last year.Imports.The aggregate imports of principal foods (including rice) last week were 166,200 tons, being 11,800 tons more than in the previous week (Table A).Cereals fell 5,200 tons and were lower than in any week for at least six months ; the aggregate for 1917 so far is 3 per cent, below that in the corresponding period of 1916. &apos;There was a considerable reduction in meat, but some increase in bacon. Further large consignments. of sugar were received. Imports of tea show some improvement, being 11,000,000 lbs. in the last fortnight; still about 12,000,000 lbs. are needed for normal consumption.The imports of oilseeds were 10,400 tons less in September than in October, while oilcake increased by 5,800 tons.Consumption.The supplies of meat in London Central Market, and in the Manchester, Glasgow, and Liverpool markets were in the week ended 6th October, 3 per cent, above the previous week (Table B) and 2 per cent.-above the average of September. As compared with the corresponding week of last year there is excess of 7 per cent, in the home supplies ; this is more than balanced by a diminution of 46 per cent, in the foreign supply.&apos;The supply of fat cattle at 51 markets (Table C) continues to exceed the supply last year.   In July, August, and September the excesses were 12, 7*6, and 7&apos;3 per cent, respectively, and last week it was 8 per cent.   The supply of fat sheep was slightly less than in the previous week, but 4 per cent, above the average in &quot; September.Wholesale Prices.English and Argentine beef and Argentine mutton each rose Is. and English mutton fell Is. per cwt.   Bacon rose one to two shillings.Stocks.The known stocks of cereals (including rice) were (Table F): Tons.September 1,1916       - 7,244,000October 1, 1916 -        -        -        -        -  6,766,000September 1, 1917 - - - - . - 8,378,000 October 1, 1917 -----  8,062,000a   4075 3 tocases were all under&apos; the old -Potato Orders, and very few prosecution^rurrdeP the new Order have been brought to notice, but several cases are under inquiry. It-is reported from Exeter that four men were fined in small sums on. the 11th instant for hawking-potatoes without displaying a list of prices. It is understood that-the Exeter police are very active in enforcing the Food Controllers Orders and the Chief Constable has instituted a special department for this purposed &apos;
, ., The. excess over last year has, therefore, been more than maintained during September,- . .... &apos; - - ,.    - -   &apos;The Autumn:fall in the stocks of wheat and oats is shown in more detail in the following table :  - :   &apos;&quot; cThousand Tons.Stock.September 1 October 1 -&quot;November 1 December iWheat.1915,2,783 2,602 2,231 2,0131916.2,599 2,399 2,313 2,0881917.3,252 3.060Oats.1916.2,968 2,749 2,475 2,1601917.3,319 3,223The position as to stocks of meat has changed slightly for the worse : -..
