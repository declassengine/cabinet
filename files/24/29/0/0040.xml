THE CHAIRMAN briefly outlined what he conceived to be the functions of the Committee. He said that at the Meeting of the War Cabinet held the previous day, it had been decided that a Committee composed as under should be appointed to assemble at once, to advise the War Cabinet on all questions relating to Air Policy :-

General Smuts (I.(Chairman)

First Lord of the Admiralty:

The Secretary of State for War:

The President of the Air Board.

A Secretary to be appointed by the Chairman. In his view the Committee should be attended and advised by the First Sea Lord and Members of the Board of Admiralty concerned with sir questions, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Director Genera1 of Military Aeronautics and Sir David Henderson. The Committee had to consider the claims of the Navy and the Army respectively in regard to the output of aircraft and the question of an independent air offensive or long-range bombing operations conducted under the direction, in the first instance, of the Committee. The War Cabinet had accepted the principle of an Air Ministry, but in the internval before this Ministry began
to function1, a Committee to the War Cabinet composed of the Heads of the chief Departments concerned together with their Chiefs of Staff and principal Air Experts, was necessary in order to decide questions of policy.   The Committee would deal with all qu^3tions of air policy,  that is to 3ay, the distribution of aircraft as well as indepen-dent air operations.   Their first duty at present was to decide what the offensive air policy was to be in the immedi-ate future   The War Cabinet desired that immediate arrange-ments should be made for the conduct of long-range offensive operations against German towns where factories existed for the production of munitions of war of all kinds.    Conse-quentlj/, what was required was not only a Naval Air Force and an Army Air Force but alao a Force for an independent air offensive.   This independent offensive night be con-ducted on land from the Western Front, and an offensive might also be conducted by the Navy from the North Sea.In view of the War Cabinet decision that long-range aerial operations should be at once carried out against German towns in which munition factories were situated, the immediate duty of the Committee was to determine the objective, the composition of the force to be employed, and the Commander to take charge of the expedition.SIR ERIC GEDDES said that he understood that the appointment of the Committee was, in fact an interim arrangement to formulate an air policy until the Air Ministry came into being.    The immediate operations which the Committee was called upon to direct, were all of a purely military character.    In order to get the best results and the fullest co-operation, he submitted that the Nqvy should have its full say in regard to the activities of any joint independent force from whatever base it might operate. He informed the Committee that the Navy hoped, very shortly, to be able to undertake operations of considerable mgni-tude by the Fleet.It was pointed out that the Navy was fully represented on the Committee and that consequently, Naval interests were properly safeguarded.ADMIRAL JELLICOE said that he understood that the function of the independent air force was to bomb munition factories and *ar industrial centres far behind the hostile lines on the Western Front; he hoped submarine factories would not be neglected.   With, regard to the immediate operations in view, he suggested that the force conducting them should be called a &quot;joint force&quot; composed of Amy and Navy aircraft.LORD COmDRAY was of opinion that the Committee wo*Id have to be a permanent Coramittet even after an Air Ministry had been established, as they would have to determine how aircraft, when co mpleted, should be allotted either to the Army or the Navy,   so far as the present war was con-cerned they would have to determine the objectives of tho independent air force.LO\D DBTBY thought that it would be necessary to distinguish between purely military -and naval objectives and objectives which were mainly political.   He would prefer to have operations of a pur^l   military or naval character carried out under the direction of the Coromander of the Grand
-3-Fleet or Sir Dou.gl.as Haig, while independent operations under a separate Commander, might be controlled by the Committee. -SIR v/IILIAM ROBERTS OH concurred in tho view that the Committoo was a body which should aot until tne Air Ministry was formed, and deal with ell questions of Air Policy.   The Committee was; in fact, the Air Ministry in its chrysalis stage.It was suggested that it was desirable to allocate one afternoon a week which should be   kept free by members of the Committee for their meetings oven if the Committee might not find it necessary to meet regularly every week.THE CHAIRMAN stated that as the Committee was an important Committee of the War Cabinet dealing with questions of ,policy, he thought that their decisions should be regularly communicatod to members of the ftar Cabinet.THE COMMITTEE arrived at the following decisions :-(l)   That their functions were to deal with Air Policygenerally as affecting both the Navy aid the Army and as concerned with the conduct of independent aorial operations.(2)   That ass regards aorial operations on cur Western Front, these should he under a separate Air Commander under the command of the Field Maishal Commanding-in-Chiof in Fiance- and that where peseicje Naval machines should he aotached to co-operate with the military aircraft.(3)   That the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Sir David Henderson should consult together and submit names to the Committee at their next Moetingi to enable the Committee to seleot an Air Commander for the indopondent offensive on tho Western Front.(4)   That Sir David Henderson should prepare and lay bofor the Committee at their next mooting a general review of the situation in regard to the proposed serial offensiv indicating the scope of our programme of construction and the progress that has been made towards the cora-pletion of that programme.(5)   That the question of a policy of long-renge offensive to be carried out by a Naval Force from the North Sea and of the Command of that Force, should be left for future discussion.
