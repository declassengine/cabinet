&apos; (This Document is the Property ofUS. I &quot;   -His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.SECRET.On leaving for India I ask permission to take a respectful farewell of the War Cabinet and to assure them that I will do everything in ray power to achieve the success of the Mission with which they have entrusted me without involving controversy if controversy can be avoided.The position in India is very serious. The forces which have been let loose in every country by the consideration of fundamentals inherent in the present upheaval have extended in a very marked degree to India. Affairs in Russia, in Ireland, the fact that we are at war with Turkey, German propaganda, apart from universal causes which find an echo in the breasts of most men, have all contributed. I cannot say, and I think nobody can say with certainty to-day, whether we can avoid a situation vastly magnified but comparable to that which has spread consternation in Ireland during the last few years. The effect of the announcement to which the Cabinet agreed and which was made cm the 20th August has been on the whole good, and those who are anxious for change are awaiting the outcome of the deliberations which the Viceroy and I are to undertake during the winter. The Extremist is, of course, trying to persuade the Moderate that it would be dangerous to attach much im-portance to a pronouncement of this kind, that there is every likelihood of faith being broken and every prospect that performance will fall short of promise. The Moderate is refusing to believe this, and so far as I can judge from the extracts from Indian papers which I receive, there is likely to be a perfectly calm atmosphere during the winter&apos;s deliberations unless anything upsets it.Since the pronouncement was made, 1 have determined that nothing further should be said. It would, for instance, certainly disturb 1 the atmosphere if a discussion took place in this country or in India as to what exactly was meant, a discussion which might lead those who feared it to think that the pronouncement had been embroidered, and those who welcomed it to think that we were repenting of it and were anxious to whittle it down.In the House of Commons, incidental to another discussion, I took this line: &quot; The announcement has been made. Its translation into, at any &quot; rate, an instalment of policy is to be the subject of our discussions in &quot; India. The Government cannot be pressed to say anything further about ;&apos; it until these discussions are over and the resolutions published. &quot; Disquisitions about the meanings of words cannot be useful. The only &quot; proper way of finding their right meaning is to translate the pronounce-&quot; ment into action. The pronouncement has been accepted as the starting-&quot; point of our deliberations. It would be unfair to those who have accepted &quot; it to ask the Government to pursue the matter here until the discussions &quot; to which they have been invited are concluded.&quot;I sincerely hope that it will be possible to maintain this attitude both in this country and in India during my visit to India. 1 have made it clear by communiques published in this country and in India that I shall make no pronouncement of policy in India at all, that I am only going to confer with the Viceroy and to be with him in receiving representations on the subject, and I have also made it clear that official business will be transacted with the Council of India under the arrangements which the Cabinet has sanctioned during my absence.Lord Chelmsford and I have concerted arrangements by which we shall be together, so that every precaution has been taken to ensure that we arc achieving the purpose we both pursue of maintaining the prestige and dignity of the Viceroyalty.Edwin S. Montagu.ss 588
