D,HS.615.Ja^ll^3^r&amp; ?s the Property of His Britannic        &apos; &apos;-&quot;&apos;TrT7Z         //SUMMAHI OF BLOCKADE III ff QRMATI Ofl * Got. 12 - 18. 19X7.-59!r4jl.   DENMARK * The Banish farmers have demanded, through theirrepresentatives in the Riksdag, that they shall he allowed, in view of the shortage of fodder, to export increased quantities of horses to Germany.   The Govern-ment are prepared to yield on this point provided that Germany offers sufficient compensation in the form of petroleum etc.   The farmers have however agreed to the rejection of a German proposal that payment for Danish exports of agricultural produce to Germany shall he made by means of a loan from the Danish banks, advanced on  the security of stocks and shares, partly of American and Allied origin.The United States propose to reply to the Danish offer of merchant tonnage (which we noticed last week) by demanding that 300,000 tons shall be chartered to themselves and the same quantity to the Inter Allied Chartering Executive.   At present, under the Shipping Agreement, H.M. Government are assigned about 200,000 tons of Danish shipping; the proposed bargain would therefore be to our advantage.Sir C. Spring Rice and the United States Exports Board have agreed upon the following proposals with regard to Danish live-stock and dairy produce(a) That the Danish exportable surplus of meat and dairy produce shall be equally divided between Germany and the Allies.fb)   That Denmark shall not export to Germany more than 2,000 head of cattle in any given week.(c)   That 20,000 tons of bacon and pork shall be export-ed from Denmark to Allied countries by the end of the year, without any conpensating export to Ger-many;   and that the remainder of the exportable surplus shall be equally divided between Germany and the Allies.
(&amp;)   That Denmark may export hides to approved destinations at the rate of 4,000 tons a quarter.(e)   That Denmark shall be allowed to import olover-seed and grass-seed for the spring sowing, but no bread-stuffs or fodder-stuffs of any kind.SWEDEN.       The Swedish Government have begun to threaten us in&amp;ir-ectly with a cessation of our supplies of Swedish pig-iron and other necessary materials.   The State Hailways, doubtless aet-ing under instructions, refuse to carry goods intended for the United Kingdom, unless the firm which manufacture these goods agree to supply the railways with English coal at reduced prices, and with lubricating oil.   However irritating this form of retaliation may be, it is a good sign that the Swedish Govern-ment while plainly aware of the importance which we attach to Swedish supplies for our munition works, do not venture to deprive us of these supplies by an open embargo.   Probably they feel that, as In the last resort they are at the mercy of the United States, it would be injudicious to embark on a   policy of open reprisals against the Allies.Admiral Lin&amp;inan still maintains the position that Sweden is prevented by her treaty obligations from placing any restric-tions upon the export of iron-ore to Germany.   But Sir E. Howard believes that the Admiral is not bigoted upon this point, and that his influence will be used with the new Minister of foreign Affairs, whoever that may be, to suggest concessions on the subject of iron ore.   Bor is it impossible that the United States may be content with a compromise.   The Bethlehem Works have advised their Government that it would be difficult for American iron-masters to absorb the whole of the Swedish exports of iron ore, on account of the high percentage of phos-phorus which Swedish ore contains.

SfflEBBB.The Swedish Government have begun to threaten us indir-ectly with a cessation of our supplies of Swedish pig-iron and other necessary materials. The State Hallways, doubtless aet-ing under instructions, refuse to carry goods intended for the United Kingdom, unless the firm which manufacture these goodsagree to supply the railways with English coal at reduced prices, and with lubricating oil.   However irritating this formof retaliation may be, it is a good sign that the Swedish Govern-ment while plainly aware of the importance which we attach to Swedish supplies for our munition works, do not venture to deprive us of these supplies by an open embargo.   Probably they feel that, as in the last resort they are at the mercy of the United States, it would be injudicious to embark on a   policy of open reprisals against the Allies.Admiral Lindman still maintains the position that Sweden is prevented by her treaty obligations from placing any restrio-tions upon the export of iron-ore to Germany.   But Sir E. Howard believes that the Admiral is not bigoted upon this point, and that his influence will be used with the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, whoever that may be, to suggest concessions on the subject of iron ore.   Nor is it impossible that the United States may be content with a compromise.   The Bethlehem Works have advised their Government that it would be difficult for American iron-masters to absorb the whole of the Swedish exports of iron ore, on account of the high percentage of phos-phorus which Swedish ore contains.
3.It is interesting at this Juncture to find the notorious Dutch firm of W.H. Muller &amp; Co; who are connected with  rupps and other German iron and steel works, assuring Sir E. Paget that Germany no longer attaches any great importance to the question of Swedish iron ore, being already sufficiently supplied with that commodity.The Swedish Government make the announcement that they are negotiating with Germany for large quantities of grain, and hare already concluded an agreement for a supply of German potatoes.   It is also reported that twenty or thirty tons of lubricating oil have reached Sweden from Germany. There is the less reason to doubt the truth of this intelligence, since we know that Denmark has received an offer of German potatoes. Obviously the German Government have substantial motives for . making such offers to the Scandinavian countries. The nature of these motives can only be conjectured.   But even Sweden cannot seriously suppose that bargains of this kind will enable her to dispense with American supplies.NORWAY.    We are denouncing seven of our Norwegian agreements;there are others which we should denounce, if anything were to be gained by that step.   But our general policy is to leave these agreements intact in all cases where the imports to whioh the agreements relate are practically controlled by the British Empire and by the United States.   In the other cases we have expressed a hope that the Associations concerned will keep the machinery of their control in being.There is in fact good reason for thinking that Norway will come to terms with the United States and the Allies. The Norwegian Minister for foreign Affairs has already ex-pressed his willingness to negotiate, provided that Norway is not expected to cut off the whole of her export trade
with Germany,Considering that the three Scandinavian powers have shown some inclination to form a league, for passive resis-tance, to the demands of the Allies and the United States, it seems desirable that Norway should be allowed to make her peace on comparatively lenient terms.iJSTHSRLANPS,.     It is believed that the Germans will shortly attempt to send their coal by a new route from the Netherlands to Sean-dinavia.   The coal will be shipped down the Rhine to itotterdam, conveyed thence to Defayl in coasting vessels, and loaded into large steamers at that port.Sir R. Paget has reason to believe that the official Dutch statistics of exports are grossly incomplete, and that large quantities of prohibited goods pass the frontier by the licence of the Dutch Government without ever appearing in the customs returns.   Something of the kind has been long suspect-ed in this country.The Netherlands Government are disposed to resist our pressure on the question of sand and gravel in transit. They demand proofs of our statement that the sand and gravel which have reached Belgium this year are actually intended for mili-tary purposes.   The President of the N.O.T. in an interview with a Butch journalist, has argued the case of his Government with some heat.   But the Butch press is by no means uniformly of this way of thinking.The question of coal is still unsettled.   The Butch Government axe grateful to us for allowing their colliers to make use of our convoy facilities;   but rumour alleges that Butch shipowners will not allow their vessels to run the riskst     of fetching coal from the United Kingdom.   Meanwhile the
fieterms of the Dutch coal agreement with Germany remain in dis-pute.   It appears that the Germans have asked for larger quantities of foodstuffs at lower prices than the Dutch are prepared to concede.UMT&amp;D STAGES.   The organisation of the United States control over war trade has been to some extent remodelled by an Executive Order dated October IS(a) The Exports Board becomes the War Trade Board, and,in addition to its former duties, undertakes the control of imports and the suppression of trading with the enemy.   The Exports Council becomes the War Trade Council.(b) The Secretary to the Treasury undertakes the controlof foreign exchange transactions, credit-transfers, enemy insurance companies and communications with the enemy otherwise than through the ordinary mails.(c) A Censorship Board undertakes the control of mails,cables and wireless; but the Postmaster General assumes the censorship of foreign newspapers and periodicals.(d) The Federal Trade Commission will control enemypatents in the United States, and United States patents in enemy countries.(e)  he Secretary of Commerce receives power to reviewthe decisions of the Customs respecting the clearance of ships alleged to be carrying goods for enemy firms.(f) An Administrator will receive and control enemyproperty.The United States no longer propose to present ultimatums to the European neutrals, with the possible exception of Sweden.   A modus Vivendi will be drafted in each case by the War Trade Board, after discussion with the representatives of the neutral power concerned, and with the Allied Governments. It is the President1 s desire that each modus Vivendi shall be regarded as a final settlement.\
1466.Until agreements with the European neutrals are fairly in train, the United States Government will hardly agree to send representatives to sit on a Blockade Council in London..
