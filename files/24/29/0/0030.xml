DEPARTMENT OW INFORMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLYREPORTONGERMANY.10th October, 1917.1,   The debates which took place both in the Reichstag and in the Main Committee of the Reichstag between Friday, Oct. 5 and Friday, October 12, are of great importance. They are a grave epiBode in the struggle of the Reichstag to ostablish its authority.    As the whole affair is much corn-plicated by oomplexitios of Parliamentary procedure, it will be convenient to give a short account of what actually happened;   this will be followed by a brief comment.2.   Two points arose;   the first one was constitutional. A proposal had &quot;been made to establish a new office of Vice-Chanoollor, to which Helfferioh has been nominated.    This proposal has not been well received, both on general grounds and because of the personal unpopularity of Relfferich. Tho Reichstag distrustB and dislikes an innovation which would tend to diminish the opportunities that it will have for ooming into personal contact with the Chancellor, and suspoct that tho result will &quot;be to make it more difficult to establish his responsibility to the House.    A discussion on this took place in tho Houso on Friday, October 5, when it was severely criticised by, among others, David - a Social-ist - and Count Posadowsky; who for many years had been Im-perial Home secretary, and himself had acted as Deputy of the Chancellor.     It is very rare in Germany for an ex-Minister to come forward in opposition to a Government proposal, and his action illustrates the manner in which discontent is pone-trating to the highest circles.
3,   The second point was a protest against the active propaganda which, as it is alleged, is being conducted in the army with the consent and approval of the Government against the Reichstag Resolution of July 19, and against the policy of an agreed peace without annexations.     The conflict between the Majority parties of the Reichstag, on the one side, and the Pan-Germans, annexationists and reactionary conservatives, on the other, has recently become more actite owiaag to the foundation of the new &quot;National&quot; or &quot;Fatherland Party&quot;, and the suggestion is that the agitation which is being carried on by this party, with the avowod intention of bringing the Roicbstag itself into discredit and opposing tho policy which has, at least in words, been accepted by the Government, is boing actively supported by the leaders of the Axwp and other officials.4, On Saturday, Octobor ft, an important debate took place on this subjoct. An interpellation was introduced by the Social Democrats pointing out:(1)     &quot;that a vigorous agitation is being conducted in the Army by those in command in favour of Pan-German policy, and in particular, also against the July Resolution of the Reichs-tag.&quot;(2)     &quot;that the Army authorities at home have issued in-structions interfering with the right of association and public meeting, and that they are favouring Pan-Gorman propaganda.&quot;Tho Socialist, Landsberg, began the debate by a long speech in which he brought forward a largo amount of evidence in support of this charge.     He strongly attacked the new &quot;fatherland Party&quot;, and their political campaigning methods. They doscribed the Reichstag as an &quot;asylum for idiots&quot; and the Resolution of July 19 &quot;as a vote in favour of a shameful peace&quot;.
All the petty chicanery in the army was exposed;   the insti-tution of a kind of prefect in each company to disouss politics with the men, and also, it is &quot;believed, to spy upon them.    A zealous officer at an &quot;educational&quot; meeting, told tho soldiers that the Emperor ought &quot;to kick Scheidomann and Erzberger out of the Reichstag&quot;.    The agitation had even invaded the hos-pitals and the prisoners1 oamps.     In the course of the doloate it came out that 100,000 people are taking part in the &quot;educa-tional&quot; propaganda.Tho replies for the Government were givon &quot;by the War Minister, General von Stein, and the prospective Vice-chancellor, Eerr Eelfferich.     General von Stein, at the outset, put himself wrong with the House &quot;by describing Landsberg^ facts as &quot;a few laboriously collected and trivial oases&quot;.    Speakers from all the majority parties protested against this glaring misrepresentation.    The Pan-Gormans and the Junker Party rosponded with vituperative interruptions anu for a while the House was like a bear-garden.He was followed by Helfforioh, who spoke chiefly about the propaganda at home, and said that he endorsed the doetrine that every civil servant is free to hold his own political opinions and is not liable to interference with them by his official chiefs;   he obviously did not convince the House.    As he continued, there were repeated interrup-tions and calls for Michaelis, who was not present, and he ended with the words:   &quot;If you have not confidence in the men who stand at the hoad of the military administration and the Government of the Empire, there is no object in my saying anything more.&quot;The effect of this debate was disastrous;   nearly all the papers, except those of the extreme Right, declared
that Relfferich had made himself impossible and must go, and Stein was equally severely criticised.5.   The result of this was seen in the proceedings on Monday, October 8.     The Reichstag itself met at 12 o1clock in order to discuss supplementary estimates for 3,000 million marks ( 150 million) Treasury Bil3e which had been passed by the Main Committee on Priday,   The meeting of the Rouse had been preceded by one of the leaders of the Parties, and it had been agreed by all of them, with the exception of the Independent Socialists and Conservatives, that instead of passing the estimates, they should refer back to the Main Committee in order to givo the Chancellor himself an oppor-tunity of explaining himself to the House on the subject which had occupied them on Saturday.     This was an action of great importance;   it was due to the gonoral indignation at tho action of the Chancellor in not himself coming to the House,-but putting them off with a very unpopular substitute; with this object they did not shrink from using the very strong measure of postponing the voting of war supplies.6.   In consequence the Main Committee met at 3 o1clock the same afternoon;   the Chancellor then addressed it.     He and the War Minister gavo explanations which, though vague, seem on the whole to have satisfied the Committeo;   Helfferich also made a rather laboured apology.     The supplementary estimates which bad been referred back to tho Committee by the House, were thon again passed;   the two Social Democratic parties alone voted in opposition.7.   On Tuofcday, Oct. 9, the House itself resumed the adjourned,debate on the Social Democrat Interpellations regarding the propaganda of the Pan-Germans and the father-land Party in the Army.     The first speaker was an Independent Socialist, Dittmann, who strongly attacked Michaelis11 speech,
calling it &quot;cowardly&quot;, and he then raised the treatment ofthe Independent Socialist Party, referring for the firsttime to the difficulties in the Navy.There existed a propaganda against any peaceful proposals for the settlement of the war.     The ChancellorTs state-ments were untruthful and atobiguous.     The fight against the Pan-C-ormans must he, at the same time, a fight against the Government.     The Chancellor was endeavouring to obtain peace by conquest.      (Dittmann was thereupon called to order).     Members of the Independent Socialist Party are put in prison.     The propaganda of our party is considered high treason.     The punishment inflicted on seamen amounted collectively to two hundred years1 penal servitude.   Several had been condemned to death.     He would ask Admiral von Capelle, who was sitting before him, if it was true that in the Navy several death sentences had been pronounced and carried out because membership of the Independent Social Democratic Party was regarded as high treason.     (Here Dittmann was again called to order).     By these means an attempt was being made to suppress the dosire for peace. The Government was a prisoner in the hands of the military party.    The Pan-Germans had free play.The Chancellor spoke noxt, and in the course of hisspeech said:&quot;What Z actually said was that officials may belong to any political party or tendency, in so far as it does not pursue the aim of endangering the existence of the Empire and the State.     For me, however, the Independent Social Democratic Party stands outside that boundary line&quot;.He made no reference to the mutiny in tho navy, and exceptfor this one sentence, his speech was moderate and concilia-tory;   he insisted, however, on the necessity of propagandawork in the army.     He was followed by Admiral von Capelle,who met Dittmann&apos;s challenge and gave further informationabout tho disturbances in the navy:&quot;It is unfortunately a sad fact that the Russian Revo-lution has also turned the heads of a few people in our fleet and introduced revolutionary ideas&quot; among them. According to the crazy plans of these people, leaders were to be selected on board all vessels to inoite all the crews in the fleot to disobedience, in order, if neces-sary by force, to paralyse the fleet and to enforce peace. It has been established by documents that the chief agitafcor fcion explained plans here in the Reichstag building in the rooms of the Independent Social-Democratic Party to the deputies, Herron Dittmann, Eaaso and Yfgtherr, who approved fefthem.     The deputies pointed out the dangers of such pr^deduro and advisod the greatest caution, but promised  heir full support by the supply of seditious material for the incitement of the fleet.     In view of this situation,
it was my first duty to prevent, as.far as was in my power, that the promised material should find access to the fleet. I therefore instructed the naval authorities concerned to prevent by all means the circulation of this material.   As regards subsequent occurrenoes in the fleet I can make no statement here.    A few unprincipled and disloyal persons whe committed a sevore offence have met the fate they deser-ved, but, nevertheless, I want to state from a public plat-form that the rumours which are current, and which naturally also came te my knowledge, aro immensely exaggerated.     The preparedness of the fleet was not in doubt a single moment, and thus it shall continue to be&quot;.This naturally led to a prolonged and angry debate,in which, not only the Socialists, but members of the Centreand the Radical parfcieB, pointed out how extremely reprehensiblewas the action of the Secretary of State for the Navy in usingevidence of this kind to compromise the Independent Socialistswhen no opportunity had been given to them to clear themselvesat the Court Martial.     It was pointed out that the witnesses&quot;by whose evidence they were now being condemned, had alreadybeen shot.    The feeling of the House seems to have naturallybeen that it was imperative that the Government should now cometo the House and ask that tho House should eensent to theSocialist Deputies being put on their trial for high troason.The Socialists, whoso action had been questioned, all deniedthat they had anything to do with the plans for mutiny;   theirconversation with the seamen had been confined to matters ccn-oeming the wolf are of tho sailors,    During the course ofthe debate, the Chancellor made a fow observations, in whichhe now associated himBelf with Gapello:&quot;Admiral von Capelle has twico read out statements that the man in question, at the time he came*here, had become a ringleader of an agitation which aimed at insubordination. That the man himself has admitted.     He oame here with his guilt in his heart, and obtained more material for agitation in the Navy.   (Tremendous uproar and cries of Enamel1) According to statements by deputies who have spoken today, this material for agitation was provided by members of the Independent Socialist Party,    This sequence of facts has been shewn by Admiral von Capelle to exist.&quot;(The debate is reported at length in the &quot;Daily Review of the Foreign Pross&quot; for October 12, and the report deserved careful study).
i85After the debate had. closed, a vote was taken on the supplementary estimates;   they were voted against the two Socialist Parties and the Polish members, who altogether number about 130, or close upon one-third of the whole House.(397 members).A motion was also submitted by the Independent Socialists animadverting upon the Chancellor^ explanations as &quot;not being in harmnny with the views of the House&quot;.   This would have amounted to a vote of no confidence, ^nd it was, therefore, rejected with the aid of the votes of two of theimajority parties, the Centre and the Radicals.     But it again brought the two Socialist Parties together in the sam* minority as had voted against the estimates.$.    A discussion then took place on Foreign affairs. The atmosphere seems to have changed, and it was then that ffnhlmarm made his important speech with the strong declara-tion about Alsace-Lorraine, and appealed for unity of the whole nation against the criminal designs of the enemies of Germany.     He of course had nothing to do officially with the matters which had been previously in debate and un-doubtedly the result was greatly to improve his position, especially in contrast with that of Helfferich, Michaelis, Stein and Capelle.9.     These debates have had a great effect upon publicopinion;   the position of the Government has been mostseriously compromised and the attacks on the Government inthe press are stronger than at any time since the war began.The Frankfurter says:&quot;The situation is intolerable;   we cannot submit to an endless chain of crises, for which the members of the Government are to blame&quot;.
The Vorwflrts says:&quot;Michaelis must go - compared with Michaelis, Bethmann was a giant;   the seenes of terror on Tuesday demonstrated that Michaelis had become officially and completely im-possible as Chancellor&quot;and&quot;It is enough to make one weep to think that we have a Chancellor like Lichaelis, a Vice-Chancellor like Helffer-ich, a War Minister like Stein and a Haval Secretary of State like Capelle.     It is enough to make one weep that these gentlemen, after all that has happened, should still stick to their offices as if nothing had happened.   It is enough to make one weep that in this most critical time of the Empire, a Government should be in power which neither at home nor abroad can command or lay even claim to respect, a Government as to whose incapacity there is a general concensus of opinion, from Heydebrand to Scheide-mann, from Reventlow to Lcdobour, and that we cannot even tell whether or no this Government will be forced to make way for another moro capable.&quot;^n0 Berliner Tageblatt;^Government does not exist now, even less than before; where was the Chancellor?   If our memory does not deceive us we have a Chancellor, and the wish of the peopleTs representatives to see him on this day was justifiable. Eerr von Bethmann Kollweg did make some attempt to put his will through, but Dr. Michaelis does not even make an attempt in this direction.&quot;Germania, the chief clerical paper, strongly condemns bothStein and Helfferich.10.     So far as the Reichstag itself is concerned, however, the crisis seems to have passed and ended incon-clusively, as did that in July.     After the debate on Tuesday, the supplies were voted and the Reichstag bad now been adjourned till December.    For some weeks, therefore, parliamentary difficulties will not recur.     This inconclusive termination is further evidence of the essential wealoiess of the Reichstag which was reforred to in the last report. There is no compact and organised opposition; there is no leader who is able to keep together the heterogeneous elements out of which an effective opposition must be created;   as point-ed out before, without such a leader it is difficult to see how the parliamentary opposition can become effective.
-9-87Technically they were nof&amp;oubt in a difficulty, for it would have been difficult in time of war to hold up supplies any longer and they shrank from passing a vote of non-confidence in the Chancellor, for that would have produced temporary chaos. Had they adopted either of these expedients, it is possible that the Government would have taken some extreme measure, something in tho nature of a coup d&apos;6tat, and wo have recent information (not very reliable) that this was in contemplation,10.      The effect of the debate on propaganda in the Army and the revelations regarding discontent in the Navy, will un-doub&quot;bedly have a wider effect than the constitutional matters at issue bety/een the Reichstag and the Government.     The first result has been to bring the two Socialist Parties together, and for the first time since the secession of the Independents, they are united in opposition to the governing classes and the administrative machine.     The attempt to use the discontent in the Navy as a weapon against the Socialists throws them back into the position which they occupied before the war.     It will be very difficult for the Government to retrieve the gross blunder which they have made.     The first impression was that they would be obliged now to ask permission of the Reichstag to waive the immunity which members of that body enjoy and allow the incriminated members to be placed On their trial for high treason.     This, we are told, is not going to be done.     There-can be no doubt that the Government had already considered the matter and know that there is no case against them which would stand legal investigation.    Ono Socialist, a woman of the name of Zeitz, has been arrested, but no one else.     Had the Reichs-tag been strong or had oapable leaders, they would of course have insisted that if there was not to be a trial on a definite charge, a Committee should be appointed by the Reichstag to in-yestigate the wholo matter.     The present situation seems to be
that Gape He- has -^rftoraLhis jres.i e^atKlon^oy rperhaps^-haa been asked by Miohaelis to do so.     It has not yet been accepted; the Emperor is away in the Balkans and his decision will be required;   there may be difficulty about this as he is supposed to be an &quot;Emperors man&quot;.     But Michaelis also associated him-self with the attack upon the Socialists, possibly because his hand was forced by OapollSj and it is difficult to see how he can remain much longer in Office unless the matter is cleared up.    But we can be pretty sure that the Government could not allow any real investigation;   there can be little doubt that the explanation of the Socialist Deputies is the right one; they had - as for years they had done - received complaints from soldiers and sailors about ill-treatment, bad food, and matters of this kind, and the Government had probably deliber-ately taken advantage of this to make it appear that they were parties to a conspiracy, the object of which was, by a mutiny in the navy, to bring about peace.     The evidence en which the charge mas mado is extremely weak;   the men v/bose state-ments were produced have been shot, and it is therefore impos-sible now to submit them to cross-examination.     It is not im-possible that there was a conversation concerning some scheme for agitation and propaganda, and that the three deputies warned th6 sailors that in this they must be very careful.     If there was a conspiracy for actual revolt, this might have been organ-ised in oooperation with some of the more violent socialists, who must be distinguished from the members of the Independent-Socialist Party in the Reichstag;   there is a party with an organisation of its own, definitely anti-national, who are bitter critics of both the Reichstag fractions.     There can be no doubt that the whole affair will have a very bad influence throughout not only the civil population, but also the army and navy, and will give groat impetus
impetus to the discontent which is apparently growing. We have statements (not perhaps very reliable) that the disci-pline of the army is being affected, for instance, the sol-diers no longer salute officers in the streets.As pointed out before, it will be a great mistake to - ,place any reliance on any immediate outbreak of insubor-dination or revolution;   the essential patriotism of the great masses of the people will prevent this so long as the war goes on, and Ktthlmann has, for the moment, done something to stem the forces which are tending towards dissolution by his strong insistence on the integrity of the Fatherland.     None the less, the very serious discredit into which the Government has again fallen, will make it much more difficult for them to keep things together during the ensuing winter, and any military regerse might produce a collapse.-   J.W.H. G.S.
