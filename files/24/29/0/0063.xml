Non-official European and Anglo-Indian opinion throughout country seems to have been aroused to danger to their interests of any radical changes in present system of Government. There have been several meetings, and expression has been given to this feeling in the European press somewhat acrimoniously and evoked recriminatory writing in Indian press. Serious disturbance broke out in Shahabad district, Bihar and Orissa, in connection with Bakr Id and spread to Gaya district. A large number of villages were looted by rioters, who are said to have been principally low caste Hindus. Police and military forces were sent to the disturbed areas. Tbe rioters suffered a few casualties and a number of arrests have been made. No fresh disturbances of importance have been reported in last few days and situation has for time being greatly improved. Owing to Dusserah and Muharram coinciding this year there is apprehension of collisions between Hindus and Mohamedans in various parts of the country on or about 25th instant.Preparations for mobilisation of tbe Kashmir Rifles for active service have been retarded by outbreak of cholera in Jammu.India Office, 20th October 1917.
