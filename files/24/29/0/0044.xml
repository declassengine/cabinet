(Oct.  18th, 19,17. )Omnium condensu canax nisi imperasset.     Is that going to he theAIverdict on II. Painleve?    For months he has been talked of as the comingS        he has been one month Priijie Minister and it looks to-day as ifMis immediate fall/were extremely probable or almost certain.     TheReport of three weeks ago spoke of his nervousness in the Tribune and tollack ofAoratorical gifts which often enable men like Fm. Eibot,iviani and Briand to save a difficult situation in an excitableChamber.     One experienced observer describes his first appearanceas Prime Minister as recalling that of a &quot;mathematical master beforean unruly class&quot;.     Contmptuous judgements of this sort may be partlyset down to the invariable jealousy shown by politicians and journal-ists towards men who, like M. Painleve.have won a reputation in a worldmere permanent than that of journalists and politicians.   But afterall it is that world.with which a Prime Minister has most of all todeal.   And M. Painlevers gift3 appear to be those of an administraetor - he was an excellent Minister of War - rather than those of aparliamentary leader which is one of the things a Prime Minister mustnecessarily be.     He gained some ground, after his unfortunate start,by the rapidity and vigour with which the Government acted in theBolo, Turmel, and other affairs.     It seemed that the new Governmenthad done more to cleanse the Augean stable in a fortnight then the^old in three months,     But what he gained over Bolo and Turmel he haslost over Daudet and Malvy.     As reported last week, his attitude inthe debate which followed the reading of Daudet&apos;s letter accusing the of the Interiorlate Minister/of giving military information to the enemy, seemed
to the Left altogether lacking in indignation at such attacks on his late colleague, and his explanation of his own action in reference to the Duxral cheque last June was regarded as very weak.   Further, a section of the Deputies for whom Caillaux was spokesman, led him, with the apparent assent of the Chamber, to promise to make some reform in the I^rench lav/ of libel, the deficiency of which is notorious.     Before 1/Ladame Caillaux murdered If. Calmette, the Editor of the Figaro, in 1914, she consulted IT. Monier,  (the judge who is to be brought before the Court of Cassation for unprofessional conduct in his relations irdth Bolo) whether II. Caillaux had any legal remedy against M. Calmette.     The answer v/as that he had hone, on which she took her own extra-legal remedy.   Such a stats of things is certainly a scandal and one or two even of the newspapers admit it and urge some reform on English lines, imposing severe penalties on journalists who make accusations which they fail to prove.     But an older par-liamentary hahd than 11. PainlevS would have seen and avoided the danger of appearing to threaten that sacred institution the 1 liberty of the nress&apos; at a time when it is already much irritated by the Censorship and when the public is very suspicious of ooliticians and unlikely to favour any plan whioh might apoear a trick of their to silence criticism.     Possibly Caillaux may have actually laid a trap for M. ?ainleve\     If so he has caught himself as well as the Prime Minister:   for the immediate revolt against his suggestion is a severe defeat, and letters from laris describe him as utterly discredited by this and by the fact, privately reported to us from several quarters, including the British Embassy, that many letters have been discovered proving that he was in communication with Bolo.     llo patriot will al-together regret anything that brings Oailleux into discredit.     But so far as the Libel Law question goes his discredit is also !.&apos;. Painleve^ who had, in a very few days, to withdraw his promise to
propose an amended law.     Already weakened by this mistake, he has now received another blow, or rather two.     last Friday, Oct. 12th, H. Hibot in reply to an interpellation made a speech about German peace intrigues in which he mentioned that suggestions had been communicated to France that if France were willing to engage in conversations she might hope for a restitution of Alsace Lorraine.     This led to M. Briand demanding: an opportunity to speak of certain peace feelers which had reached h&amp;m   and the result was a Secret Session on Tuesday. When the public sitting was resumed the leader of the Socialists -refused on behalf of his party to vote for any Order of the Day implying confidence in M. Pdbot.     The result was a division which showed no o-o^osition but 200 abstentions.     V/orse was to follow. The Government c few days ago issued a communique&apos; stating thut the inquiry, which had been going on during the last week, had disapproved the charge of treason brought against M. Ma Ivy;     The matter oame up in the chamber on Tuesday when a Royalist Seputy pressed for an ad-mission that this represented the opinion of &amp; Painle-v-e and net that of the officer appointed to conduct the investigation.     He also re-vealed the fact that the Prime Minister had had an interview with H. Laudet three days before the latter1s letter was read to the Chamber. M. Painleve&apos;s reply, which admitted that the opinion given was not a judicial one but came from the Cabinet, and admitted the interview with Daudet, was badly received and hi3 refusal to have further dis-cussion till the judicial authorities hod pronounced on the affair, was only carried on a division by a majority of 57.This is such a great fall from the usual majorities that, unless [retrieved in some surprising fashion, it points to an early Cabinet Crisis, and a new Prime Hini3ter.     Incidentally it will have indi-eated that mere character and the possession of general respect and confidence are not enough to make a leader in France.   The Eouse of
- 4 -Commons has been successfully led by Lord Althorp and I,Ir.&quot;7.K. Smith. That could not hanpen in the Chamber, it seems, even when to their character is added the intellectuel ability of 1.1. Painleve.     If only a first-class speaker can lead the Chamber who will it be, if M. Painleve&apos;s fall becomes an accomplished fact?     Not M. Ribot again; for the whole conduct of the Socialists in the division and in the late Cabinet Crisis shows an animosity against him which is no doubtdue to a petty desire to have their revenge on the man who had the courage to refuse the Stockholm passports.     Besides M. Ribot is very old.     Then there are M. Viviani and M. Barthou each of whom has been Prime Minister before and is known to consider himself the right man to be so again.   Of course, conjectures at this early stage are very hazardous but on the whole it ssems more likely that M. Briand&apos;s recent re-appearances were intended to be, and may prove to be, the heralds of his return to isower.     He intervened in the Malvy debate to join in protecting M. Llalvy;   he intervened conspicuously in the debate on the diplomatic service last Friday, and it was his desire to speak that crused the secret session on Tuesday in which he seems to h..vc set himself in somo kind of opposition to M. Ribot.But whc;.t ,:beut the Soci*.lists, who would have tc be reckoned   -with in -.ny &quot;Ministori:. 1 crisis?   Would they tolerate the return rf M. Brir;nd, whom they particularly dislike and who has $ust gone out of his way to wound them c&quot;n a very tender point, by declaring in the Chamber that their (favourite formula &quot;no secret diplomacy&quot; has &quot;absolutely no meaning&quot;, end that public diplomacy would be the same thing as none at all?   It is notalle that while the Conservative and moderate capers weloome I,:. Briand&apos;s return to the Tribune with a profusion of compliments such papers of the Left as Le Pays and L*Humanite are very cold,     Net only do they point out, as even the Dobats does, that &quot;no secret diplomacy&quot; does^not mean that-all
negotiations are to be conducted in public, but they adopt a generallysuspicious attitude against M. Briand personally.If, then, M. Briand was making a bid for power-he took a curiousway of doing it.     For it is certain that the Socialists would playa considerable part If a Cabinet Crisis occurs.     What line theywould take is not yet clear.     I hoped last week that a few days wouldshow quite plainly what situation the Bordeaux Congress had broughtabout.     But it does not look as if the position will be clear till fsome de^nite Issue,&apos; such as that of a ministerial crisis, compels the Socialist leaders to act in one way and refuse to act in another. Meanwhile the view taken last week that the Congress resulted, broadly speaking, in a victory for the Majority, which included the Extreme Right of the party, is confirmed by later details.     The resolution of the Minority which refused to allow nay Socialists tc enter a Government except on conditions of passports being grcntec&quot; for Stockholm was lost, and thet of the M&amp;jcrity, which desires pass-ports but does not make them a condition of taking office, was carried.     The defeated Minority, too, declared themselves ennosed in principle to the party taking office.&apos;   They do not indeed by cny means &quot;absolutely reject participation&quot;, as the Manchester Guargian has mistakenly asserted:   but they declare their objection to it and only admit is under exceptional circumstances for a special object and under more strictly expressed conditions than those laid down by the Majority.     But even the MajoMty declare that participation is not only to be conditional on general agreement about a programme in war and peace proving possible, but also to be &quot;controlled, as it has been in the past&quot;, by the maintenance of close relations between the party and its delegates (a word to which the Temps justly draws attention) in the Government.     But there is much safety in &quot;as it has been in the nast&quot;:   M. Thomas was no mere slave of a party.   On
the whoLe--i-t- seeTnB--i^1i^ocA^^right in claiming a Victory as they privately do.     They.-point out that the 1 Stockholm at any price&apos; section went to Bordjeaor^-eTrpe^rtong^ to capture the party and that, far from achieving this, they would have been defeated even if the Centre - which with Thomas ahjd Eenaudel worked hard to unite the two wings - had ultimately voted with them.     But these were determined not to break with the Right wing, and the Minority under Longuet, the grandson of llarx, were determined not to break altogether with the Kienthalian extremists, who oppose war-credits.     Hence a split was inevitable.VHhether it will go further remains to be seen.     At present, as the Temps says,- the Congress has achieved neither unity nor scission.     There is nominal unity about National defence as well as about the general Socialist programme:   but the Right lays its chief stress on the one and the Left on the other.     Nearly all are genuinely patriotic but the one section see the immediate business of saving France through a mist of internationalism and the other in daylight and with clear, eyes.     The rift may soon be widened by an invitation to take office.If there is a crisis they are sure to be pressed to do this. Their discipline and earnestness even more than their numbers give the$ great weight:   how great is seen by the large amount of space devoted to their doings even by the bourgeois press.     The wisest of them, such as Vs. Thomas, are undoubtedly preparing for the corn-promises without which they cannot hope to share in the Government or achieve any real results.    In this connection it is Interesting to notice that the Pays draws from the Congress the conclusion that the Socialist party is shedding &quot;its traditional rigidity&quot;, and drawing nearer to the ordinary Republicans of the Left.
i. PJ *J- 7 -little or nothing was heard at Bordeaux, it asserts, of the old&quot;war of classes&quot;:   and private information confirms this view to theextent that a meeting of these extremists was very thinly attended.It may he worth noting that the debate on French diplomacy drew from the victoire the interesting comment that the diplomatic success of the Allies were really due to the soldiers of Verdun and to the &quot;formidable power of England&quot;.     Attention should also be drawn to an article in the Times of Oct. 12th declaring that there Is no other policy for the Allied Nations but to fight on till the rulers of Germany accept the Rhine as their Western boundary, and especially to the mischievous statement at the head of the article that it is representative of jVonqh opinion.     This is the very reverse of the ; case:   as may be seen not only from II. Ribofs speech on Sept. 19th, which was warmly received by all parties and is utterly inconsistent with any isuch ambitions, but also from the fact that tho demand for the Left Bank of th e Rhine is now angrily denounced as Imperialism by the Left and so far as I know, seldom put forward even by the Extreme Right,J.
