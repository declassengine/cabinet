h ?. -stannic Majesty&apos;s Government)welpakb of TjrFiS5^ 173.(.&apos; *The Departmental Committee, of whioh I was appointed Chairman, which was set up in Hay, 1914, by Mr. Herbert Samuel, then President of the Local Government Board, to consider the condition of the Blind in the United Kingdom and the meana available for their industrial or professional training and their assistance, have recently presented their Report.The Committee find that the number of persons returned as totally blind is approximately 34,000 and that the problem 9t reducing the proportion of the blind to the population 1b an extremely hopeful one;   to quote their own words, they are oon-vinced that if their recommendations are adopted the proportion of the blind to the population will be gradually and permanently reduced.The Report includes recommendations having as their object the development and extension of the existing machinery of education, training, and pensions for the blind, and these recommendations are receiving the consideration of the Board of Education and the Charity Commissioners, In so far as they touch upon the work of those Departments.The Committee make other recommendations dealing with matters, some of which at present do not fall specifically within the province of any existing Government Department.   In particular, they recommend -(!) the provision of further accommodation in workshops for the Blind, and(3) additional funds to provide pensions for the Blind who / are incapable of earning their living.The Committee came to the conclusion that the provision of more workshop accommodation is the crux of the whole question, so far as the capable&apos;blind are concerned, that whereas there are only some 3,000 places in workshops at present available there are enough blind persons worth training to fill another 3,000 places, and that therefore the workshop accommodation in the United Kingdom should at least be doubled.   Incidentally, the Committee found that over 9,000 incapable blind were in receipt of poor law relief.With regard to pensions, the Committee found that the sum at present available is wholly inadequate for this purpose.The Committee alBO make various recommendations relating, among other matters, to the prevention of blindness, the establish-ment of a register of all blind children, enquiries into the condition of the Blind in foreign countries, the adoption of a uniform definition of blindness, the improvement of atatisties, and the co-ordination of the work of various voluntary organiea-tions which care for the Blind outside Institutions.A frequent cause of blindness referred to by the Committee is ophthalmia neonatoruni.   This disease it is estimated ie responsible for 10$ of the total amount of blindness among the population of the United Kingdom.     I am confident that the Local Authorities can by special care and action on approved lines materially diminish the numbers rendered blind, by this scourge in infancy, and I may mention that the Lccal Government Board have in recent years taken active steps to cheek this disease.     It has been made universally notifiable, and a large and increasing number of Local Authorities have made arrangements for visiting
and for providing home nursing and hospital accommodation for cases needing this assistance^    More recently, the Department have asked the Metropolitan Asylums Board to provide hospital accommodation for eases of &quot;this disease in the Metropolis, and a conference has already-taken place for the purpose ef settling the extent and.nature cf the accommodation required.The Committee recommend thai to give effect to such of their proposals as do hot fall naturally within the purview of anyof the existing Government Departments, a special Depart-ment should be set up in the Ministry of Health, whenever suoh a Ministry, is created, and in the meantime should be set up in the Local Government Board, and that the administration of thin Department should be carried out under the immediate guidance of an Advisory Coanaittee of persons associated with the care ef &apos; &apos; the Blind.&quot;   -It is proposed that the Advisory Committee should act for the whole of the United Kingdom and should, therefore, include representatives of Scotland and Ireland.     This would seem to be, an advantageous arrangement, and preferable on many , grounds to the appointment of separate Advisory Committees for Sootland and Ireland.On the other hand, the Local Government Board would have ho. statutory powers to   exercise the functions of the new .,  Department outside- Bigland and Wales, and it would seem,&apos; there-fore, that these powers should be exercised in Scotland and ; -Ireland by the Local Government Boards for those countries.Subject to the concurrence of the V&amp;x Cabinet, it is proposed /bo take, immediate steps to set up the new department in the Local Government Board, and to appoint an Advisory Committee.   Legislation &quot;&quot;would not be nocessary for this purpose.i v;-. r-7 - ff -\---.y -----      - . --; , Ths .0-010311 tt.ee further recommend that, funds should be.. placed at the disposal of. the Oehirai Authority so eonstituted, partly to.meet the capital.expenditure involved in oarrying out the Committee&apos;s recommendations and partly to meet the relativer, annual expenditurea   , ;-. The ,oapital expenditure, estimated to reaoh  500,000 at the outside, would be mainly to defray the oost of increasing the aooommodation in workshops in which, as mentioned above,&apos; :3000 additional places are required.     The annual expenditure -estimated at, 250,00.0/would, be for. grants to institutions and other organisations / pensions to the Blind, and other purposes from time to time arising. , .,..r : If the reoommendations. of the Committee are generally . accepted by the- War Cabinet, the details of the financial arrange-.: nenta will be discussed with the Treasury.   It may however be - observed that no oapital expenditure on workshops would be under-taken until after, the War, and that grants required in respect of annual expenditure in the first year or two would probably fall short of the Committee&apos;, s estimate of  250,000.. . I am well aware, in view of the enormous expenditure which the Country is at present incurring, of the reluctance of the Chanoellor of. the Hxchequer to incur any fresh Capital or annual liability, but I must plead the call.of the Blind in all ages and all Countries fdr sympathetic treatment, and when we loan measure that sympathetic treatment by such sums as half-a-million oapital expenditure and a quarter-of-a-million annual expenditure I dare to ask for favourable eonsideration of my Committee1 s Reptrt even at such a time as: the present.   *W. H. FISHER.
