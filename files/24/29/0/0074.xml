*/- *i. J / &apos;T   -****** w&quot;w&apos;*MMEMORANDUM FOR THE ^AR CABEKET.I agree with Lord Filner that the time has come when tbe Cabinet should consider the position of their Food Production Policy.     The need for an increase in food production of all kinds, not only corn, is very urgent, and is increasing.   There is an actual scarcity of milk and butter, and if this becomes greater, the effect upon our town population will be very seri ous.As regards the increase of arable land, what is really required in roy judgment, is a clear statement of the policy of the Government. At present there .is great doubt,great misgivings and grave anxiety, as to what the Government really intend to do. I receive communications from all over the country telling me that&apos;the compulsory ploughing of grass lands selected without care or discretion, is having a very bad effect upon the farmers. Lord Filner only expressed the simple truth when he told the House of Lords that if the policy of increased food production is to succeed, we must carry the owners and occupiers with us. I use the word &quot;owners&quot; advisedly, because I do not think the Cabinet realise how immense has been the increase in the number of owners during the last few years.   In almost every County, large estates have been broken up or reduced in size, and the tenant farmers have become the owners of their land.     They bought it under certain agricultural conditions, and paid for it accordingly, and they are naturally vexy much disturbed if they think that they are to be compelled to do that which will immediately affect the value of their property.   If we are to increase the. food supply, especially of corn, it is not sufficient to secure the ploughing of the land, we must make certain that we shall have the&apos;hearty co-operation of theoccupier
occupier in all the subsequent operations which are necessary if a decent crop is to be obtained.The policy advocated by the Prime Minister and by Mr. Protbero is wise, and if carried out loyally, will undoubtedly increase our food supply, and benefit agriculture, but there appears to be great confusion in the minds of those who are charged with the work in sone of our districts.   At one moment farmers are told that they are guaranteed given prices, and that therefore the production of food crops will in future be profitable: at another moment they are told that there must be &quot;community of sacrifice&quot;.   If the first statement is correct, what interpretation is to be placed upon the second.   It is in the attempt to carry out the second suggestion that so much hostility has been aroused.   At the time immediately preceding ths Crimean War, prices of wheat were very high, and a great deal of land was broken up and put under the plough, with very good results for a certain period of years.   But eventually much of this land turned out to be wholly unsuitable for corn production, and in my own County, if I may take it as an illustration, many,an unfortunate farmer lost all his capital and died a broken man, owing to the fact that in the seventies he found it impossible to grow decent crens from the land under cultivation.   The cause was not so much the low price, as the fact that the land being-.unsuitable for corn growing, the crops were small in quantity and inferior in quality..      As a result, in the late seventies and eighties a great deal of land went out of cultivation.      Whole tracts became derelict owing to the inability, or incapacity, of the owners to face the situation.     But in other cases a great effort was made to keep things going.   The land was carefully and skilfully laid down to grass at great cost, fences made,buildings
buildings erected, water supplies provided, and in almost every case the result of this has been eminently satisfactory, myself stood the other day in a grass field which was laid . down in the year *84.    For the three preceding years to &apos;84 it had never produced three seeks of corn to the acre, and yet the farmer was a man of a high order of intelligence, who did everything that skill and energy could do to make his land productive.    Now his son, the present occupier of the farm, told me that that field, when the cows graze there, produces many more gallons of milk in the day than any other field on his farm, and yet Under present conditions that field might be ordered to be broken up at any moment.I do not think that the farmers feel any greater confidence in the looal Committees because farmers are represented there.    They would much prefer to have the opinion of expert valuers who would examine their land and report in accordance with. the. examination. : But at all events one thing is certain.    Agriculturists must be told plainly what the policy is.    If it be to increase the food supply, then obviously the land to be broken up must be careful]y selected, and the co-operation and concurrence of the occupier secured.    If he is a bad, slovenly farmer, and his landlord is unwilling to deal: with him,.- or he ds himself the owner of tho land, obviously compulsory steps milslv be; taken, but it is incredible that the Cabinet, intend to. apply compulsion in cases where theowner, the occupier, and an independent valuer agree that thewhe&quot;e &apos;land cannot be profitably broken up. or mirx&amp;&amp; a good andcapable - farmer -sees only disaster before him.. There is an un-comfortable suspicion in some quarters that war conditions arebeing used to force upon the agricultural community a change intheir agricultural system, of which many of them disapprove.I am confident that this :cannot
cannot be the case, as it would be wholly wrong to do this in time of war.   -What we want is an increase in our food production. We want more com without sacrificing milk and butter.   We can get al.1 this;   there is plenty of land in the country which ought to be under the plough, and with the co-operation of the farmers this most desirable result can be secured.    But if we put them against us, even though.we may succeed in ploughing the land, we shall certainly not sucteed in getting an increased food supply.      I venture therefore, to hope that the whole question may be considered by the Cabinet at an early date.&apos; I hope, however, that the Cabinet will not lose sight of the fact that the season has been singularly unpropitious for growing more corn.    Many farmers have informed me that it will be as much as they can do to get their existing land cleaned and ready for sowing.    The continuous and heavy rains have water-logged the land, and the result is a terrible profusion of weeds of all kinds.     Scarcity of labour has made it inposcible to keep hedges trimmed or ditches cleaned out, and it is only by Herculean efforts on the part of the farmers themselves with the indifferent labour at their disposal, that they will be able to prepare the existing arable, and in some cases add to it where there is suitable land.    But I desire to impress upon the Cabinet that the co-operation of the agricultural oommunity isessential if success is to be attained  An increase in the food supply is one thing which can easily be secured, a drastic and compulsory change in methods of agriculture is another, thiscannot, and should not be attempted in War.W.H.L.
