Hotel JonesCtpy Not1689SEC RJiiWar Office.20th October, 1917.Secretary, War Cabinet.I forward for the information of the War Cabinet a telegram No. 1310 of the 15th October from General Barter. I concur in his view that we should do all in our power to secure the early inclusion of as great an Armenian element as possible in the Russian Forces in the Caucasus and in North Persia.This measure appears to be.the only one which offers any reasonable hope of checking the rapid disintegration of the Russian forces in Asia and the spread of the vigorous Pan-Turanian propaganda of the enemy.    The Armenians are the only large body.on the Russian Asiatic front whose interests are vitally bound up with the success of the Allied cause.The immediate measures required are as follows :-A. To press Russian General Headquarters to ensure that all drafts and reinforcements sent to the Caucasus shouldconsist of Armenian troops drawn from units on the European front; this measure to apply in the first instance to the Russian troops in North Persia based on the Caspian.B, To concert with the United States in bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on the Russian Government to allow of the recruitment and formation of Armenian units for service on the Caucasus front.I am instructing General Barter to press the Russian General Staff for the early adoption of the measures noted in
(Sd.) W.R. Robertson, C , I .G-.S ,2.&quot;A&quot; above.   A copy of the telegram I have despatched to him Id attached herewith, but I consider that General Barterfs hands would be much strengthened in the matter if his action were supported by early and urgent representations from the British and American Governments*As regards the recruitment and formation of Armenian units in the Caucasus, tho Russians have already recognized the fighting value of these units and have themselves initiated the formation of eight battalions.   Our Military Representative In the Caucasus as early as June in this year formulated certain proposals the substance of which was telegraphed to the Foreign Office by Sir George Buchanan (No.939 of 20th Juno) in which the co-operation of the Americans, who have a great interest in tho Armenians, was suggested.   It is probable that America would be prepared to assist both financially, by onlioting Armenians now in the United States, and by sending representatives to assist in the organization of Armenian forces.   The efficient raising of Armenian troops is largely if not wholly dependent upon the readiness of the Russian Government to accept tho assistance of a British or British-American Mission of selected officers.It is suggested that the British and American Governments should combine to induce the Russian Govornmont to invite the despatch of such a Mission which would bo placed at the disposal of the latter.
OPERATION?.SECRET.From;General Barter, Russia.To: - -C.I.G.SWar Office.15/10/17.10.29 p.m.1310.XXXXMy Staff Officer Lieutenant Col; Maitland-Edwards has returned recently from Caucasus and has made suggestions to me which might if carried out perhaps solve whole difficulty as regards getting proper military support for Maude in the CaucasusEdwards made exhaustive enquiries and saw number of local notables.   He came to the conclusion that the only really loyal troops in Caucasus were Armenians; all Russian officers in that theatre endeavour to get attached to Armenian units or else got Armenian reinforcements for their regiments.    In vie?/ of the critical situation of the whole Armenian community some 1,800,000 souls, surrounded as they arc by Mahometan races, it is not surprising to find that they are loyal to Russian Government, their only hope being in tho success of the Russians. They view with alarm hopeless condition of Russian troops on the Caucasus Front, who act, i-n reality, as the sole barrier between them and the wholesale massacres that would take place if the Russians went or were driven back.Edwards was assured by influential members of . tho Armenian Committee that their countrymen were only too willing to fight, as they would be doing so for their actual existence.     It is unfortunate that the Russians themselves have net grasped the importance of having all their available Armenian soldiers on the Caucasus front.   Less than 35,000 out of about 150,000 now in the Army are on that front.   Strong representationsby Armenian Cemmittee have resulted in permission for formation of six Armenian battalions which by now should bo ready for the frent.   Cemmittec however feels itself too weak to insist on thetransfer
transfer of the 100,000 odd men on the other fronts, and they begged us through Edwards to bring all our influence to bear to effect this.I have already taken the matter up with C.G.S., but have confined myself so far to the suggestion only, which was however very favourably met.        I have notified Caucasus Military Agent of my action, and have left them to take initiative in this matter.       I feel strongly that this is a question we should insist on, and one on which we should not hesitate to bring diplomatic pressure if necessary.      It is obvious that 150,000 Armenian infantry anxious to fight, and moreover having fullest confidence in us, would prove an invaluable asset to the general strategical situation in the Caucasus.I propose to suggest to Russian.G.S, that as many reinfor-cements as possible for Caucasus Army should in future consist of Armenians.       Majority of units now on this front would thus gradually become Armenian in character, and there would be no necessity to lose time in forming new units.   I shall propose that this plan with your approval shall be adajpted first of all to troops in north Persia I.e. those who are likely first to (? come) into contact with Maude. It would perhaps be goodplan to offer to take Armenian infantry into our Mesopotamian forces?        Might it not also be possible to obtain the consent of the Americans to allow Armenians in America to be enrolled for service in Mesopotamia with Maude?

Your 1310 of the 15th October.

I concur in your opinion that we should do all in our power to secure tho early inclusion of as great an Armenian element as possible in the Russian forces in the Caucasus and North Persia. All our information points to vigorous Pan-Turanian and pro-Mahomodan propaganda in the Caucasus by the enemy who is taking advantage of tho disintegration of the Russian forces.  You should therefore carry out your proposal and press that as many drafts and reinforcements for the Caucasus Army as possible should consist of Armenians, and that the scheme  should apply first of all to the troops in North Persia. You should in addition represent that tho recent despatch of Mahomodan troops to tho Caucasus theatre is playing into the hands of the enemy and should suggest their transfer to another theatre.

2. I add for your private information that I am approaching the War Cabinet with a view to obtaining the  combined assistance of the American and British Governments as regards the Armenians and it is hoped by diplomatic action to secure the invitation by the Russian Government of a British, or British American Mission to assist in the formation of locally raised Armenian Units.
