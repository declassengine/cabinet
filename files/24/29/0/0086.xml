Ministry of Shipping)A.TONNAGE,The total tonnage available as at 30 September 1917 is shown in the annexed statement as regards vessels of over 1600 tons gross.The gross tonnage available at various stages in 1918 may be estimated as follows :Date.1 Nov, 1917 I Jan, 1918 1 April 19.18 1 July   1910 1 Oct..   1918 31 Dee. 1918Gross tonnage available Total gross tonnage for commercial workincluding small vessels, including munitions,, but.15,800,000 15,400,000 14, 900,.000 .14,450,000 13,950,000 13,500,000.excluding oil.6,600,000 6,150,000 5,600,000 4,.800, 000 4,300,000 4,100,000The figures make allowance for those vessels doing commercial work on homeward journeys and for small vessels (500 - 1600 tons gross) doing overseas commercial work..     They are reached after deducting those vessels entirely on service for. Allies- and allow for an increase in tho tonnage to be lent to France and Italy for further supplies of cereals.   - Vessels for further coal to Italy will probably bring imports on return and deduction need not be made in the above statement.     A Russian service, as- in 1917 is assumed.;, The monthly losses assumed are 325,000 gross tons:    this is assumed to cover VJar and Marine- losses and an allowance for damaged ships which are unrepairable.     The: shipbuilding and overseas purchases of new vessels are in. accordance with latest&quot; estimate. .&apos;
We have assumed&quot;that n^-demand&quot;^ridA.-W-made on us by the United States for tonnage but that they will by their building-1 be able to keep their armies supplied and repay us for any vessels which w^fmay have to lend them temporarily.B.     ILfPORTS.The imports brought by the tonnage indicated above will probably be about 8,000,000. tons less in 1918 than in 1917-The distribution of this decrease may reasonably be taken as 670*000 tons a month.If munitions or imports for making munitions are to be. carried exactly as in 1917 the other goods Will have to bear the whole loss of 8,000,000.If the total, imports for 1917        be taken as 37,000,000 including all Government imports (except Admiralty oil) it may be taken that /5-,000,000 would be required for &quot;Munitions&quot; The balance of 22,000,000 of which 14,000,000 tons are foodstuffs will have to bear the loss of. 8,000,000 tons.A full report on the position in 1918 is in preparation: many complicated factors have to be brought into account and until the work is completed any estimates given must be taken, as rough forecasts liable to alteration.   The result given is the most optimistic that-can be made.(initialled) w.P.2.pis try of Shipping&apos; S t at i sd c al B r an ch&apos; 24 October, 1917,
