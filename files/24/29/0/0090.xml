/1.     Finance.Financially Turkey is bankrupt.   Apart from any advances mentioned hereafter, she owes Germany and Austria between them 330&apos; million pounds on which the interest alone represents more than her annual income.   Her paper money is not welcomed anywhere, and in Turkey itself where the refusal to, accept it is punishable by law, the lira realises only 22 piastres,as against IOC in peace time, while at Eazaretli about the middle cf August the value of these notes seem3 to have been only 10 piastres.   Paper piastres even are in circulation and postage stamps are tendered instead of smaller coins.2.     Agriculture Distribution.The supply question in.Turkey has always been, and still is, dependent on the question of distribution, and there has probably always been msre food in the country, than-has been accessible, .grain being stored in secluded.villageswhile in other places starvation conditions prevail.   An instance of how transport can open up the resources of the country, is the despatch to Germany-of 1,000,000 sacks- of grain.which is reported to have occurred this year, probably from the Konia district where 70 German motor lorries&apos; were said to be working in July last. &apos;The collection of supplies has been detrimentally affected by the..universal use of - paper money as the Arabs in the south, and probably the villagers in districts remote from the railways, refuse to bring in their supplies for other than cash payment. . In order to raise supplies for the Army,, the Germans are reported to have despatched as much as ,25,000,COO in bar gold to Constantinople.   - , :/Though, the Germans have paid attention&apos; to the matter cf transport,- this&apos; is.practically all&quot; concentrated for military purposes-and the civil population securea little benefit therefrom. Steps taken by Talaat Pasha to effect an equitable distribution of food-stuffs &apos;ard to.fix prices have failed, owing to the dishonesty of the officials, .-.. Thi s is particularly the case regarding transport which is ail allotted by Government, but for the:use of which merchants have to pay heavy bribes to the sanctioning officials.      ;..The districts in which Germany has done most to increase productivity appear to be those of Angora and Konia,    The Konia. irrigation works,&apos; which were..completed in 1913,. were carried out by a German firm and it is stated that in the&apos; Irrigated regions controlled by tho Army Authorities the production has greatly increased in comparison with earlier years, Ploughs, harrows, reaping nachines and threshing machines have recently been despatched from .,Germanj/ to these regions, together with expert agriculturalists to teach the peasants their use, and though primitive methods still prevail, even in important Corn-growing districts, the introduction of these machines must h,ave done a certain amount to counter-balance the lack of labour. Turkish troops have also been lent for farm labour, and ^Agricultural battalions&quot; have :Vven been formed. &quot;V/ork has begun in the early part of 1917 on the scheme for irrigating the Adana Plain and a Dutch I-ingineer was despatched in connection with the operations;   but the cotton crop this year has been below the normal,
si3,     Harvest..    Roughly speaking^ -perhaps 60$ of t&amp;e normal - acreage,- or, according to Turkish figures,- about 10r000,000 acres, is now under cultivation, and this cultivated area probably yields not more than 50$&apos;of a&apos;normal pre-war harvest per acre, with the net result that about 30$ of the normal pre-war supplies are available.-   This will be enough for the Turkish Army,- but the civil population Is undoubtedly suffering and is likely tr suffer further.   Last April the whole country was divided into five supply areas, apparently exclusive of the Konia district which it is surmised may be reserved for Germany.-Deforestation.   At the beginning of 1917, it was stated that there hadT^eh&quot;lTreckless waste of timber in Turkey.   The woods on the Upper Bosphorus were cut down in 1915 to obviate a fuel famine in Constantinople,- and the demands of the railways and furnaces must have made a heavy drain on timber in the absence of coal.   The Balestine and Kedjaz areas are known to have been deplenished to a serious extent.     Certain regulations have been issued for the preservation of forests, and about 50 acres are believed to have been planted near Constantinople,    It is now said that Turkey has mortgaged all her forests against .an Austrian advance of  T10,000,000, though this requires confirmation.4.     Minerals.As regards mineral resources, the coal, or rather lignite output haB been developed, particularly in the Soma area, where an aerial railway has alleviated transport difficulties, and there is stated to be now sufficient coal for the requirements *f the railway system and for Constantinople, though the Zunguldak supply iS largely cut off as Turkish shipping has practically ceased to&apos; exist-,&apos;A certain amount of minerals are reaching Germany in return ir$$y&apos;91 from Constantinople,   These minerals take the form of ceppe r fvpWi;Argh&amp;na* chromite from Kutahiyah and Aidin, quicksilver Sf^om the Smyrna district, lead from Balia, saltpetre from Konia. berate of lime from Bala Kesr, emery from Aidin, and possibly a very small quantity of nickel from Kastamuni.In May it wa* reported that:..German geologists and surveyors were making it survey of Western Asia Minor, and according to a later report a company had been formed in Munich for the purpose of investigating and exploiting the mineral wealth of Turkey. &apos;5.     Exports.In return for the coal and military supplies which she received from Germany, Turkey exports large quantities of cotton,: olive oil, dried fruits and tanning materials to the Central Powers.     5 truck loads of these articles were said to leave Constantinople daily for the West last July, and several truck loads of olive, oil destined for.Germany are reported to have fceen destroyed in the recent fire at:Haidar Pasha military station.In June this year there,were reports of considerable quantities of tobacco being expert ed, but wool and mohair, which seem to have been sent to Germany earlier in the war., are apparently now used in Turkey itself for;the making of army cloth, i of which there appears to be a very-considerable shortage, for entire units have been seen lately,dressed in Russian and Belgian uniforms.
The cotton exports have been and remain-&apos;considerable. Lp to the end-of October 1916. 50,000 bales of cotton had been exported to Austria, and it is stated that half of the cottos crop of Adana (where there is a cotton mill and a clothing factory) this year, i,e. about 10,000 bales, is. being;sent&apos;to Germany.Opium is also exported to the Central Powers for the manufacture of morphine and practically the whole crop from Afiun Karahisear amounting, to some 15,000 cases was sent to Europe this year.     A minor form of export i3 the food which all Germans in Turkey send hCme in parcels.6. r Han Power.This is practically exhausted both for military and civil requirements.     The Armenian massacres have seriously affected farm labour;   the Lebanon is reported to have been depopulated for all practical purposes,  the Anatolian population has been called up for military purposes, probably to the last man, and the Kurds and Arabs are too independent to be utilised fully. The Greeks,, who are being made to fill the gap have also, according to report, decreased in number owing to ill-treatment,Female labour has been called on to some extent, but it does not seem that this can be developed so fully in a Mohammedan as in a Christian-country,     A sure sign of the v/eakness of Turkish man power is the. heterogeneous composition cfnany units in the -Turkish Army.     Though the majority of prisoners of war captured are Turks, they Include also Greeks, Albanians, Armenians, Pomaks, and Jews, as well as Russian and French Mohammedan and occasionally Indian, captives..    It is even reported that Greeks are being trained as officers, and an attempt has been made to enlist Persian subjects in Turkey;.     The&apos; jails are also reported to have been emptied, in order to supply labour,7,    epidemic a.. ...-  The Turkish population, military and civil has suffered from typhus, and the medical service has suffered very severely from active service, with the result that there are believed to be few doctors left and women are now admitted to the medical profession (a great advance for a Mahomraedan country).   There is believed to be a serious shortage of medical stores.     There have been intermittent outbreaks of cholera, and the physical condition of the whole country is probably low owing to economic distress,8.     Transport.. There is a great lack of animal transport in Turkey. The wastage of camels in 1915 is reliably reported to have been extensive, and 19/000 camels are known to have died in the liaan area alone in 191S,   Officers in Syria and Palestine have recently had to give up their chargers to re-horse a cavalry regiment, though i t i s reported that, purchas ing o ffi cers have now be en sent to Deir er Zor on the Euphrates with  50,. 000 to try and get horses. In hesopotar-ua,  exemption from military service is granted in exchange for transport animals instead of money, and the increased number of machine guns&apos; are to be carried in carts owing to the lack of pack transport.   A certain amount of oxen are still purchasable in the Deir er Zor district at  15 a head.however,
- Howeverthe transport question has been mitigated from the military point of view by the introduction of German motor lorries and replenishment of rolling stock and it would be unsafe to assume that military concentration cannot be supported at the expense of the civil population.9.     Munitions.-As regards munitions., although factories have been established in Constantinople and there are reports of small factories in Mosul, Kirkuk and Damascus, Turkey is almost entirely dependent on Europe for her supply of ordnance and munitions.. Some of the latter is not of the best quality according to recent report, and Turkeylosses in the recent explosion at Haidar Pasha station were probably serious,10.   Oil.The petroleum field3 in Turkey do not seen to have been developed to any important extent and Turkey is&apos;still dependent upon Europe for oil fuel.     The oil fields atKala Shergat in Mesopotamia, in particular-, show no sign of making the Turkish Army self-supporting in this respect.   Lack of lubricants at one tine affected the railways seriously, but there is reason to believe that this situation has been improved, possibly owing to the adaptation of olive oil to lubricating purposes.   A doubtful report has been received of &quot;the discovery of lubricating oil near the Dead Sea, and dive oil is said to be treated for lubricating purposes in White&apos;s factory In Beyrut,11.   Political.. (a)   The. Grand /Vizier.    -Talaat, who is credited with.being a patriot, has probably&quot; been au fait with every move in the. Russian revolution, both before and 3ince its outbreak, and has relied on it to save Turkey.   He is a strong nar^ of bulldog \tenacity, and an accurate assessor of facts, who is not likely to be bluffed, while he is ready to turn every move in the game to account.     Though reported now to be contemplating the introduction into Turkey.of 50 ,.000 German colonists he will not scruple, and probably-intends to break away from Germany at the right moment .if he -can manage it. But Turkey has been playing a dangerous game and it is doubtful whether she has not got too deeply into Germany&apos;s clutches for Talaat to be able to extricate her.(b)   German domination.      The domination of Germany over Turkey seems a fait accompli owing to the financial position, and though the Finance Minister Javid, nay resent this state of&apos; affairs, he is believed nevertheless to have just raised another  50,000,000 on the security of German bonds.   Enver seems to have sold himself body and soul to the Germans,.and he has so far been able to secure the loyalty of the army and to crush attempts made to overthrow him personally as evidenced by the Yakub Jemil case,Germans are now represented in every branch of the Turkish Government, and, though Turkey has been permitted by Germany to abolish the capitulations, the Treaties effecting this, which were signed between Germany&apos;and Turkey this year, may be assumed to safeguard German interests in the Country, and to place Germany beyond the reach of the &quot;Shuria&quot; or Holy. Law.
However, the transport question, has been mitigated from the military point of view by the introduction of German motor lorries and replenishment of rolling stock and it would be unsafe to assume that military cbncentration,:&apos;cannot be supported at the expense of the civil population,-9.&apos;    M&amp;nitionsyAs regards munitions,- although factories have been established in Constantinople and there are reports of small factories in Mosul/ Kirkuk and Damascusl: Turkey is almost entirely dependent on Europe for her supply of ordnance and munitions?,. Some of the latter is riot of -the best quality according to recent report, and TurkeyTs losses in&apos; the recent explosion at Haidar Pasha station were probably serious,10..   Oil,The petroleum fields in Turkey do not seen to have been developed, to any important extent.and Turkey is -still dependent upon Europe for oil fuel.     The oil fields at Kala Shergat in Mesopotamia, in particular-, &quot;show no sign of making the Turkish Army self-supporting&apos; i,n ,this respect.   Laok of lubricants at one tine affected, the railways seriously-, but there is reason to believe that this situation has been improved,, possibly owing to the adaptation of olive oil to lubricating purposes.   A doubtful report has been received of the discovery of lubricating oil near the Dead Sea&apos;, .and olive, oil is Said- to be treated for lubricating purposes in White 1s factory in Beyrut,11.  ^Political&apos;,- (a),   the; Grand--:-^i-ii-er.,-..   -Talaat, who is credited with be.ing a patriot, has probably *een au -fait with every move -in the. Russian revolution, both&apos; before 4nd Since. :its outbreak, and has relied on it to save Turkey.... He is a; strong nan, of bulldog tenacity, and an acourate assessor:.of: facts-,.;who . is not likely to be bluffed, while he is ready to turn, every move.-in the garae&apos;to account.  .&apos; Though reported now to be contemplating&apos;the introduction into Turkey of .50,000 German:, colonists he will not scruple, and probably intends, to break away- from Germany at the right moment if he&apos;can manage it* But Turkey has been playing a dangerous, game and it is doubtful -whether she lias not got too, deeply into&apos; Germany1 s clutches; for Talaat to be able to extricate her,-   .(b).-German; domination.   .  The domination of Germany over Turkey seems/a fait. acepmpli owing-to&apos;the financial, position, and though, the Finance.;Minister: Javid, may resent- this state of affaires/he/.jls..-&amp;feii yed:; nevertheless&apos; to have just raised another  50,.000,,000 on the security&apos; of German bonds.

but the continuance of this, state of affairs cannot be guaranteed unless the Italian Government takes decided military steps to&apos;, deal with: the situation in Tripolitania,(e)   The Arabs.;,.    The pursuit of a relentless Pan-Turanian policy in which the restoration of the.Turkish language and the training of the young should not be overlooked has produced an Arab situation which can only be described as dangerous for the Turks, and which, as indioated above, may cause a change of methods.   Ibn Rashid is the last important Chief left on the Turkish side except possibly the Imam Yahia who is cut off in Yemen.   Even Ibn Rashid has had to vacate his capital at Hail and place himself under the protection of Turkish troops.   His adherence is only retained by the payment of large subsidies.Though receiving scant assistance from the Government the Turkish commanders in the Kejaz are known to be extremely depressed about the Arab situation which they fear will spread to the Porth.   In Mesopotamia by subsidies and promises the Turks seem to have retained a certain hold on the Arabs as well as. the adherence of the Muntefik Ajaiml es Sa&apos;dun but the political situation in Mesopotamia depends on the ultimate issue of military operations.   In Asir the remains of a Turkish Division have been cut off since the fall of Mecca, though it is remarkable how Turkish prestige in Yemen has been maintained by the Turkish Vali energetically backed by Ali Said Pasha the Military Commander at Lanej, though cut off from the rest of the world.(f.)   The,Kurds.     These people who have never fully been controlled by the Constantinople   Government, and of whom some showed sympathy towards the Entente in the earlier stages of the war appear lately to have,been lending the Turks more active assistance, and they   are to some extent replacing Turkish regular troops in front of the Russians in the Caucasus.   This is probably thanks to German gold. &apos;(g)   The Opposition.     Though powerless for all practical purposes there is an opposition party in,Turkey which does not approve of the relentless policy,pursued by theC.U.P. and this- . Party views the German penetration into the country with no   :      -favour.   It Is interesting in this connection to note that there are signs that the Germans are feeling rather nervous about their position in Turkey after the war. and&apos; Sturmer, ex near East correspondent, has gone so far as to declare that Germany will have nothing to expect even economically, from a victorious Turkey; and, the statements of.certain Turkish Ministers during the war in which equality -tf tpportunity for all nations in Turkey after the war was emphasised combined with certain language restrictions lends a certain colour:tq the&apos;idea that, while it may suit the Turkish Government to make use of Germany now, the country has no desire to be saddled with Germans in perpetuity.&apos;al Staff, fer Office, 24.10.17.
