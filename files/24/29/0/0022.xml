i iII-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM 10 MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.WORK OF THE SUBMARINE SERVICE DURING THE THIRD YEAR OF THE WAR.Admiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet.A short Survey of the work of the Submarine Service during the third year of the war is submitted for the informa-tion of the War Cabinet.Coastal Submarines.The number of these submarines employed offensively against enemy submarines has been greater than last year, and the comparatiyely few which have been employed for .Port defence during the year have been changed as often as possible, in order to provide experience for young Officers. The Coastal Flotillas have supplied trained Officers to man the 35 new Fleet and Oversea Submarines which have been commissioned during the year*Fleet Submarines.The initial difficulties in regard to these vessels have been surmounted, and 14 have now been commissioned and formed into a flotilla attached to the Grand Fleet.     The Commander-in-Chief considers them a most valuable adjunct and is of opinion that they may prove of inestimable value in battle.Oversea Submarines.The flotillas of Oversea submarines have necessarily been almost entirely employed in anti-submarine patrols, but on the only three occasions when enemy surface warships have come far afield they were successfully attacked,,Although sightings and encounters take place almost every day, submarine v* submarine has proved to be capable of providing only a sporting chance of destroying the enemy, owing to the difficulty of estimating the course and speed of one submarine through the periscope of another*There is no doubt howeverithat the number of submarines actually sunk is quite incommensurate with the definite moral effect 7/hich is produced by these anti-submarine patrols^The number of submarines employed on Overseas patrol has increased during the year from 63 to 79, and thework performed by them is of the most arduous nature,    In summer they remain submerged for 19 or EO hours, after IE hours of which the air must necessarily be extremely oppressive.   In winter the rough weather and cold and at all times the apprehension of striking a mine and of being mistaken by our-own Patrols are a great trial of patience and endurance, which is so rarely relieved by the exhilaration of an encounter with the enemy.Recently two American Submarine Officers, who went on a weekTs patrol in our submarines, admitted, to use their own language, that they were &quot;all out and fit for nothing&quot; at the end of it, although each experienced the sustaining effect of6SEC RET.G.T.-E32EWARC A B I NET.

Two other submarines which collided at exercise, and one which foundered on trials., have been salved and recommissioned.In the three years of war 73 officers and 633 men have been lost, which is approximately 10^ per annum of the personnel employed.
