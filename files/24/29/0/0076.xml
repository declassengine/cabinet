Document j* the PropeiBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government, iI \ SECRET .Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BttA/018.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary. XVIII. (23rd October, 1917.)The Austrian-Swiss frontier has been closed for some weeks paot and news from Hungary is therefore more than usually ocanty au no Hungarian newspapers are allowed to leave the country.Parliament having adjourned, there ha4 been a lull in the political (situation: but the Wekcrle Cabinet cannot be nail to have a firm seat in the saddle, despite all the skill of ito chief. In Austria meanwhile another acute crisis has been averted for the moment.     The Government succeeded by coneeooiono of which we do not as yet know the detailo in preventing the Polioh Club from voting againot the Budget and thereby placing the Government in a hopeless minority.    Although the Poleo have thuo shown that there are occasiono upon which the Slav bloc in not effective, it would be quite a mistake to regard it a&apos;, having collapsed.     In certain caoes the Poles will undoubtedly, as always in the pact, , place their own narrow Polioh interests before those of the Slav cause as a whole: but the situation is ouch that anything like a quarrel between Polefi and Czechs or Jugo-Slavo io impossible.Undoubtedly the main thing that is takinr; olace behind the sceneo ** though wo are allowed to know nothing about it - id a determined attempt on the part of Germany to commit Austria-Hungary to new and far-reaching economic ties before the moment for peace arriveo.     The fact that Austria-Hungary is in oo desperate a position from the political, financial and economic point of view, and in particular with regard to the clothing and health of the population, and therefore looks forward with peculiar dread to
Q - 2 -another winter campaign   such a? might jiootfibly prove beyond her powero of endurance, only serves as an incentive to William II and the clique of generals who surround him to force on before it is too late a decision in directions which might bring economic relief to their ally, and thereby (oo they reckon) permanently forestall the possibility of the Entente acquiring economic in-fluence in Central Europe.    The recent journeys of the Emperor to the capitals of his allies is almoat certainly connected with these economic designs.     Confirmation of thia view comeo from a generally trustworthy rsource, which hay direct mean;; of access to Austrian diplomatic circlet:-.Further information from an absolutely sure source confirms both the general survey of Southern Slav policy given in my last reoort, and also - v/hat is much more important - the steady growth of dioaffection among the Austrian Slav regiments and their officers - not only the young reservist officers, who from the first have been for the moot part keenly national!at in feeling, but even thoc-e higher in command.     It will be remembered that a vital part wa&apos;.&apos; played in the fall of Gorizia laut year by the desertion of the Bosnian Serb Colonel Turudzija at the head of his regiment and with a set of fortification plans in hiu pocket, and that many thousands of Jugo-Slavo and Czecho have since surrendered to the Italiano.     The best proof that the Austrian authorities take the matter very seriously lies in the otepo which they have taken to prevent the Italiano from exploiting these surrenders or allowing the men to volunteer on the Allied side; for they have actually threatened in that event to send a corresponding number of Italian prisoners to Bulgaria or Asia Minor, as a characteristically effective reprisal.The recent surrender of another Bosnian Serb regiment on the
- o -Roumanian front is a very practical proof that the Jugo-Slav troops in Austria are getting more and more out of hand.R.W.3.W.23/10/17.
