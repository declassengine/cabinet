(This Document is thrrroperty cfA7yHis Britannic Majestv*s Government)91SUPPLY HP GTJNS BY ADMIRALTY FOR DEFENCE OFAdmiralty Memorandum for the War Cabinet,In oonnection with the request fthioh has beenreceived by the Admiralty from the War Of floe for the supply of an additional 24 guns for use in the defence of London against enemy aircraft^ the Beard desire that the War Cabinet should be aware of the serious effeot whioh compliance with the War Office request would have upon the programme of defensively arming merchant ships *defence of London, 16 3&quot; H,A* guns, which would other wise have been used for defensively arming merchant ships, and 22-guns which were taken from the number allocated to New construction and Reserves,   There are nc more available from the latter source and if any further guns are to be supplied they must be guns which are allocated to the defensive arming of merchant ships.It will be remembered (Admiralty Memorandum 2,10.17) that in view of the shortage cf steol it was decided that a programme of one gun only per merchant ship should be adopted, and at the present time there are2,1.79 merchant ships of over 1,550 tons grcssregister which require arming or re-arming with 4K or larger guns:981 merchant ships of 1,50C tons gross register and under whioh require re-arming with 3B or smaller guns.1,028 merchant ships which are entirely unarmed.The rate at which the arming and re-arming ofmerchant shiP3 is being carried out has averaged 62 snipsper week during the last four weeks, but it is anticipatedthat an increased delivery of guns will enable 75 shipsThe Admiralty have alreadjr provided, for the
per ween tc be armed and re-armed in the near future. It will, therefore, take at least 12 months to complete the programme ao far as regards existing ships without taking into account the requirements for new construction.The attached table gives particulars of British merohant ships which have had tao- capitulate after action with enemy submarines during the last four months owing to their gun having been outranged and does not include ships with inadequate armament which have been sunk otherwise than after a gun action,Events have proved that the defensive armament of merchant ships is a very important means of defence against enemy submarines, and it is anticipated that difficulties of convoy in the Winter owing to bad weather, and the prospect of larger submarines which are now building, operating at greater distances, will more than ever necessitate a merchant ship relying on her own resources, that is, maini^r on her gun power.The submarine:- is at present the enemy1 s most effective weapon against us, and the Board desire to point out that in their view there is considerable danger of too great optimism prevailing in regard to the Sufbmarine Casipaign situation and that any further reduction in, or postponement of, the programme for defensively arming merchant ships is to be very strongly deprecated , as it must almost certainly result in an aggravation of the injury which the enemy1 s submarines are inflicting upon the Allied cause.(Signed)   E.
