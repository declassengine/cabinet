mWAR.   GiBINg-l?.SEDITIOUS. SPBlECHaS- M3?-&apos;DRILLING IK IRELAND. Memorandum by the Chief Secretary.The stimulus which lias been given to the more violent spokesmen of the Irish revolutionary party by recent occurrences has led to a revival of provocative speeches and determined efforts of organised plans of drilling whioh seem to necessitate further consideration of the instructions given some time since to tho police.Annexed heroto are a series of short reports (Annex A.) of speeches of the kind referred to above. Concurrently with receiving these I have learned of difficulties which present themselves to the Inspector General and the Chief Commissioner, and in some degree to the Commander-in-Chief as to tbe methods by which the regulations relating to such matters should be enforced.     I annex communications (Annexes B. C &amp; D.) which I have received from these several officers.I should be glad to have some guidance with regard to a difficult situation which&quot;involves perils of various kinds.(Intd,) H. E. D.20th October, 1917.SSCRET. G.T. 2353.
REPORTS 0? VARIOUS SPEECHES OP BE VALSRA,(i)   AT FACTORY CROSS, CO, CLAREr October 4th, do Valera said the time for speech making was&quot;now past, and the hoar for action arrived.   The whole trend of his speech was to drill and arm at once, and that they would never accept any settlement short of an Irish Republic.   He said each Sinn Fein Club should have at least one modern rifle of which all members should know the mechanism (a member of the crowd shouted they were not depending on one).    He told them to start at once arid purchase shot guns and buckshot, as it was more effective at close quarters than ball cartridge.   He also told them to get pikes forged as these provided with 10ft, handles were useful articles.As the motor car moved away a revolver shot was fired and four heavy stones were thrown at the police.(ii)   AT RUANEr CO, CLARE * October 6th, de Valera advised those present to join the Sinn Fein Club, and keep it alive as &quot;the political side of your organisation&quot;, and said he also wanted the men to organise the physical force side, that is, the Volunteers.   He then advised them to drill and train, and said &quot;Get eTmiry rifle you can and those of you who cannot get rifles get shot guns, and if you cannot get these, you can get the old weapons of your fathers, the pike, a very good weapon at close fighting&quot;.     He said England never gave anything except when she saw Ireland was ready to offor any sacrifice in order to attain her object.   He also said, remember you arc not asked to fight for any foreign oountry, it is for your own country you are asked to fight.(iii) AT INAQH, CO. CLARE. Ootober 5th,de Valera said &quot;Our policy is complete independence from the British Empire, and the right to be represented at the Peace Conference.    I ask all the young men to band themselves together in the Irish Volunteers so that if we cannot get what we are out for by peace methods we can get it by physical force.   We will do our best to arm you.   Get all the arms you can - any kind of arms.   Shot guns - you know what a useful weapon a double barrel shot gun is at night.   I think the peelers are learning something from us.    If you cannot get arms that old useful weapon at close quarters - tho 7 feet pike.&quot;(iv)   AT CQROFIN, CO. CLARE.   Ootober 6th, de Valera said &quot;His cliief object in coming there was to thank them for electing him as their representative.   He should have come before but owing to his great victory in Clare his services were required elsewhere.   The young men from 18 to 45 should join the Volunteers. They had older men than 45 in some of the armies - and they should take every opportunity of improving their knowledge of military matters.   It was not necessary that they should be able to march like guardsmen.   What was necessary was that when required to go anywhere or do anything it would not take half an hour to explain to them what was required.     They should get all the arms they could.   We, he said, will supply you with as many as possible, but you have a sufficient number of rifles amongst you for all to f   become acquainted with the mechanism of them and be able to handle them when the time comes.   Nothing is to be gained by argument unless there is force behind it.   In 47 the people of Ireland died from starvation.by the thousand while food was being taken out of the country.   They should be prepared to prevent such a thing occurring again.     It was better   die with arms in their hands than from starvation.&quot;
Yesterday morning I visted the Districts of Tulla and Killaloe, where I also discussed matters with the Officers in charge.   -I then proceeded to himerick and inspected the force there.It will, therefore,, &quot;be seen that during my two days1 absence from Dublin I was able to obtain the o dnions and views of a considerable number&apos;of Police Officors0As regards tho general state of Clare, I consider that it is unsatisfactory, but not quite so bad as I anticipated.The people are in an unreasonable and impossible temper, defiant and sullen towards the police, and towards any measures necessary for the maintenance of Law and order.The County (including a large number of the clergy) is Sinn Fein almost to a man, but those who have any property at stake in the county are not so by inclination but as the result of intimidation.    This intimidation Is not at present very active in form, simply because such activity is not necessary;    the people are afraid to do anything elso but to shout with the crowd.At present I do not think they are prepared for, or would desire, an ooen revolt, but, wit.;.- the existing temoer of the young men, a considerable msmber of these would be pre-pared to follow their leaders in any insane undertaking that circumstances might bring about,The feeling towards the police is very bad;    this also is often more or less the result of intimidation, as I am told that if a man is met alone he is inclined to be civil, but if he is with others he is always sullen and afraid to be seen talking to, or showing any friendliness towards the Force.,As regards the question of Drilling, about which, I feel sure you are anxious to obtain definite information, I -discussed this matter most fully with the officers Goncerned. As a result I have arrived at the following conclusions., The drilling, as at present carried on, is of nomilitary value, it is frequently carried on merely to show defiance of authority, and the men who give the words of com-mand often do so for the sole purpose of being arrested and thvs becoming heroes in the locality*   It is apparently their opinion that if they are. to get appointments, etc., it is essential that they should suffer imprisonment and also that if they do suffer such imprisonment they will be well provided for in future from the funds controlled by the Sinn Fein Executive.Having arrived at this conclusion, the question arises whether this drilling would be more effectually stopped by ignoring it altogether, or by continuing the arrests.   The former would be an ideal solution of the difficulty but, after, mature consideration, I do not think that this would have ^the effect of stopping the practice, except, indeed, we had at our backs the assistance of the clergy (which is not likely to be given), end the assistance of public opinion attended with ridicule, which has always a considerable effect in this Country.It will, therefore, be admitted that if ignoring these minor drillings would not have the effect of stopping them, then the question arises is it safe to.allow such dril-lings to be continued?   I think it would be most unsafe, as the movement will grow enormously and in a short time we will have companies and battalions marching about the country, adding to their numbers and intimidating the peaceful popu-lation, eventually getting the movement entirely out of the
control of the Police,   hre should errive at a oosition very like what was found &quot;before the rebellion - only much worse -for where the Irish Volunteers were in the minority then, the great majority of the young men in the country now are enthusiastically inclined Wards the Sinn Fein movement. Gradually we should find thorn arming themselves with sticks, wooden guns^ &amp;c*, and a complete organisation would he in existence ready for the receipt of fire-arms,I therefore sco no alternative bus vigorously to suppress this drilling by arresting the ringleaders.   I fear also that short sentences will only lead to more trmibXe, as immediately a man is let out from orisun he becomes a local hero, and thus draws adherents to the movement.It is very unfortunate that the Government should be coerced in this way into action, which may be termed provocative, but I see no alternative.I am sorry to say that I was unable to see the Bishop.   I called on him on Monday afternoon, but found that he had left for the country and that he would not be back until the end of the week,    I regret this very much, as I should like to have had the opportunity of discussing matters with him had he permitted me to do so.As regards Limerick;    I think there are more dangerous elements there than there aro in Glare,   The drilling has recommenced and, unless it is suppressed, will grow to an alarming extent,I am glad to be able to tell you that the men of the Force are doing their work excellently, but it is only right to say that they are having an eivoeedingly hard time. You, yourself, can realise what it must be to these men to be shunned by a: large numoer of people in the country with whom they were previously on friendly terms,I ho ;e it may be possible perhaps in the Debate to say some encouraging words about the Police.   We rely upon them for almost everything in this Country, and I am being overwhelmed with requests from the various Government departments to carry out practically all the Executive work connected with the various War measures which have now become necessary.   Any encouraging words spoken in the House of Commons would have a good effect on the men, who can be relied upon loyally to carry out their duties in an efficient and tactful manner.In conclusion, I would suggest that if the drilling is to be put down, great discrimination should be exercised as to the persons to be arrested;    the arrest of nonentities and mere boys has a bad effect;    one or two such instances have already occurred, for example, the boy Harte who was referred to In the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; articles.I regret very much having to send you such a lengthy letter, but I am anxious that you should be made fully aware of the opinion I have formed from my visit to the County.Yours very truly,(Signed)     J. BYRNE,fRt. Hon.. -H. E. Duke. L0.,JJ.P, Chief Secretary.
(v)   Report from Sergeant Orowley. JSojraJL JC^sh 0cmstabulary, oin^e^faTer^^ SotoEer 11th, 1917.I beg to report that the above meeting was held at Kilbane on last night, about 600 people (men, women, and juveniles) attended. ^ The Leitrim (0TBriensbridge S,D) and the Broadford bands attended.   The members of the former band appeared with uniform caps and belts, and was followed by others similarly dressed.On De Valerars arrival per Motor Car, he was received by Rev. D. Flynn Silbana, from the front of whose house, a tem-porary platform, the speeches were delivered.    Thomas Gunning, 15,C, presided.   Fathertflyhn addressed the meeting denouncing the arrest and imprisonment of Lieutenant R. Coleman I.R.A. who drilled the young men of ICilbane, preparing them for the fight for freedom.     His arrest he asserted was one of the most shameful and dirtiest piece of work ever committed in the locality by two of Dublin Castle- hangers-on, but he said nothing better could be expected from the old Peelers.   He then read a resolution of sympathy with the relatives of the late T. Ashe, whom he said was cruelly murdered by the Assassins of Dublin Castle.De Valera next addressed the gathering and thanked them for the part they played in the Election campaign in electing him.     He then referred to the murder of 2. Ashe in the Mount joy by the hirelings of tho British Cabinet.   Ho advised them to organise and band together to keep oh the fight till the opportune,moment comes to strike again.   A time which would certainly come within his lifetime.   He advised to stick to the food their own oountry produced and not allow John Bull&apos;s Agents to tase it from them by force as they did in 46-47 when 1-g-millions of Irishmen were allowed to die of starvation - all through Alien rule, which had neither a moral or a legal right in this country.   To achieve their object, he told the people they wanted more than talk, they wanted, he said, somethingmore cutting.jHe then told them to get a proper knowledge of the Rifle, and anyone who hadn&apos;t a rifle to get one.   He told them who had rifles to teach the mechanism of it to their oomrades.To those who couldnH get the rifle he advised them to use shot guns and the old pikes that their forefathers donp good work with.   And if ali failed to use the two pronged  &apos; fork.   He said suoh instrument never lost their fighting value at close quarters, and to use them if conscription is attempted.He said it is better and more honourable for Irishmen to die at home fighting their British oppressors and Dublin Castle gang than die on the battlefield of Europe for the cause of England.     He said it was their former Representative that said &quot;England^ difficulty is Ireland^ opportunity,&quot; these words still hold the test of time.   France was bled of her man power while England was getting ready, and please heavens England will be bled before America is ready.He advised every man to join their own National Army and to join no other Army.   He said he spoke there in o ;en defiance to all the forces the British Government could send hero to-night.He then referred to the police in connection with the Bodyke Evictions, and the Easter week Rising, and their dirty work of to-day, swearing away the lives of their own country-men, and taking orders from the British Cabinet - all for a little pay.   He said he believed that when the occasion
arises again for a fight that he could count on the support of many of them, and in the meantime he hoped that the others who are now blinded would realise their position and jump from the depths of degradation into which they had fallen.I( Father Flynn again addressed the meeting, this timethe gist of his speech was a shower cf abuse in the R,1*0. he warned the people not to mi?,; salute or speak to them, said they were the curse of the country and the lowest and most degraded type of human beingsv   He specially advised females not to spoak to or go with the old peelers who were the vilest and most demoralised villians in Ireland, and he told them to go home quietly and say nothing to these traitors, Dublin Castle spies end renagades, lest they may waylay them on the roadside.   He then called for rthe Soldiers Song&quot; which was sung (and -very badly sung) and the meeting terminated quietly at 903Q psm,L1I2.SPEECH OF COUHT HAHjggTT AT STROKES TOO, 10,3.0,17*&quot;England is no longer dealing with a child, but with an armed enemy.   Her armies are not shattered in France. She is no longer master of tho seaSs     If you want to be an independent nation, you must arm, drill, and join the Sinn Fein movement,&quot;1   BlPersonal Report of Inspector General, Royal Irish Constabulary, to the Chief Secretary,Royal Irish Constabulary Office, Dublin Castle.PERSONAL &amp; 17th October, 1917.CONFIDENTIAL*Dear Mr. Duke,I returned last night from the 6ounty Clare, and hasten to comply with your directions in letting you know the opinions I formed as the result of this visit,I arrived in Ennis st mid-day on Monday, and, after inspecting the men, I discusser the situation with the County Inspector and with the District Inspector of the Ennis District. In the afternoon I visited Ennistymon and Corofin - calling at Police stations on the wayeBoth Ennistymon and Corofin are District Headquarters, and I took the opportunity of getting the views of the Officers and Head Constables stationed there.
SUBMISSION BY COLONEL JOHNSTONS, CHIEF COMMISSIONER. DtfBLIM METROPOLITAN POLICE.&quot;f    Under Secretary,In the ordare issued for the guidance of the R.I.C., I understand that in cases of drilling,, marching, and wearing uniforms the Force has been directed to take note of those engaged in these practices and to report to the C.M.A., but not to interfere actively or make arrests *My directions to the D.M*P. are that &quot;drilling, marching in military order, marching with weapons and carrying arms in a public place without licence should be vigorously prevented&quot;.Is it desired that those instructions should now be modified and brought into line with those issued to the R.I.C. ?(Signed)   \&apos;u E. JOHN ST ONE.0.0.9th October, 1917,0.1,MARCHING- AND DRILLING. Under Seoretaryfs Note on Chief Commissioner^ Submission.In the provinces, the R.I.C. generally recognise persons drilling and wearing uniform, so immediate arrest is not necessary.   The D.M.P. on the other hand often do not know by sight even the leaders of drilling parties, and have therefore to take and verify their names and addressee, which involves temporary detention.The directions quoted by the Commissioner set out verbatim the decision of the Cabinet as conveyed to us.In present circumstances I think it is essential that drilling on any considerable scale which aims at mill-tary efficiency and organisation and is not merely the bravado of a few youngsters should be proceeded against until it is stopped.   This would Involve the warning of all suoh persons that they are committing an illegallity and calling upon them to desist and disperse and generally the arrest and temporary detention of the leaders.   If they are to be dispersed the diffioulty is to say what degree of force should be used to disperse such assemblies, and to carry out the objects of the polioe.   It should be sufficient, I think, to seoure the identification and, if necessary, the arrest of the leaders, and to protect the police against attack.   But it would not justify a- baton charge on men who were merely slow to dis-oerse or/ were passively resisting.(Initialled)   W.P.B.9th October, 1917.
B,MEMORANDUM by Sir Bryan Mahon . tol..theChigf Secretary, with regard to a&quot;&quot;Maeting at&quot;&quot; Soariff,County &quot;Glare, when there was a parade of men in &quot;quasi&quot;military order.CHIEF SECRETARY4This meeting at Scariff, County Clare., on the 9th instant seems to have been one of a series of meetings held by Be&apos; Valor&amp;.He wore uniform at nearly&apos;all his meetings, and presumably did so at this meeting too.Prior to the holding of this Scariff meeting some 350 persons marched in fours through the streets.   Seven of these - six of the seven wearing uniform - seomed to act as leaders and gave military orders.   In all eight men wore uniforms of a military character.It might be considered whether the drilling should be dealt with as an unlawful assembly, under the Criminal Law and Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1887, or whether the leaders should be tried by Court-martial.   But it is suggested that the following points should be taken into account;Luring De Valera^ meetings in Clare there were numerous cases of drilling and marching to and from meetings.I do not see how we can prosecute the minor offenders for drilling and wearing uniform at his meetings without prosecuting De Valera.    Moreover prosecutions in various counties are instituted from time to time by order of the Competent Military Authorities for various offences under the Defence of the Realm Regulations including drilling and wearing uniforms and, if we do not take the same action in all such cases irrespective of the position of the offenders, it leaves the Competent Military Authorities open to charges of inconsistency, vacillation and weakness, and it leaves the polioe in a state of uncertainty and bewilderment as to how they ought to deal with breaches of the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and what they ought to report to the Competent Military Authorities,(Signed)     B. MAHON.Lieut,-General, COMMAHDIUC-.IH-CHIEP THE FORCES INIRELAND,P.S,     This case being urgent I should like to have yourviews regarding the procedure to be adopted as soon as possible,(Initialled)   B.M.Headquarters, Parkgate,18.10.1917,
D.cl.18th Cctcber 1917,My dear Mr0 Luke,I sent you an official letter to-day asking what you wish done about men wearing uniform at a particular meeting in Glare.There is no doubt that they are doing so now more frequently and in open defiance to our proclamations but as at the majority of these meetings de Yalera himself has been present and very often wearing uniform^   it makes it difficult to take notice of the lesser men and leave him alone.At Limerick it is also getting badj   also the drilling but I have ordered&apos;  3 or 4 arrests there although the same argument applies except that de V. was not present.    I know all the difficulties about dealing with the leaders and . am doing my best to follow the Policy of the Government as I know it, but no notice having been taken of the leaders makes it almost impossible to deal fairly with the offences of drilling and uniform.     And I am positive it will not do to ignore them altogether,,I hope after the debate on Tuesday some definite policy will be decided on.I am glad there is to be a debate as it willenable the public to see the true state of affairs and thatfar from being provocative the Administration have gone as far as possible in the opposite direction.,Yours very sincerely,(Signed)       B. MAHOK
