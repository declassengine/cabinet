HARVESTING  OPERATIONS.

All the corn is now cut except a few isolated fields in late northern districts. The heavy rain of the past week has further delated the completion of stacking and thatching these crops. The returns made by the Agricultural instructors in the different counties ?now that much loss damage than was anticipated has be on done to the coin by the in-element weatner ? prevailed during the harvest season.

Owing to the water-logged condition of the soil, the digging of the ?ctato crop has been delayed, and some reports received show that thu? tubers are commencing to rot on heavy or retentive soils, Unsprayed crops are reported in be badly affected with disease, and to show a striking reduction in the yield of marketable potatoes as compared with ?rops that were properly sprayed.

Late out meadown have been practically lost owing largely to the delayed harvest and the rain.
