&apos;THIS JOCIBMT IS THE^PROPER^^ OF, ILiff^^^y^^JjLJ^^r^-V^- GOVERNMENT^ S E C RET  WAR    CA^INEo?&quot;      &quot;   &quot; TONNAGE FOR ITALY.&apos;   Memo by Sir E- Wyldbore SmithI desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the-serious situation which has arisen owing to a decision which it is understood was taken by the Italian War Cabinet earlylast week.In view of the shortage of this year&apos;s grain crops in Italy, the Italian Government decided in order to avoid risk-ing a revolution owing to lack cf food, t^ divert some 75 cteamere-df a total tonnage of 374,00 tons to the-grain trade. They calculate that these vessels will convey an additional quantity of grain to Italy amounting to 120,000 tons per month.This decision v/as taken without any previous reference - -to the Italian Representatives in London,  or ty   the British Government.   As soon as it was known,  it was- at once reported to the Ministry cf Shipping,  at whose requee,t a telegram was sent to the British Embassy in Rome by the Foreign Office,, in      -which was.pointed cut the serious effect which suoh diversion would- entail not only on the Italian Coal supplies but also on ,. . the supply of&apos; ore to. this country.   It was explained that on the fene -.- hand, the quantity of coal shipped from the United   -Kingdom.to Italy would be reduced not only to the extent of the carrying power of the diverted vessels, but also to the extent-of coal sent ir British tonnage in ocmpensation for the loss of the carrying power of-vessels bringing iron ore to England on their return voyage from Italy.The Italian Government were at the same time notified that in order to make good the loss of iron ore resulting from the a-oticn of the Italian Government,  it would be necessary te-Instruct British vessels now in the Mediterranean, whiph would otherwise have been .sent across the Atlantic, to return to the United Kingdom with ore, while other vessels, which wxuld other-wise have taken coal from this country to Italy, would new have to Tjrooeed to America for wheat.    It was further pointed out that some of ths vessels which it was; proposed to send to North or South America were unsuitable cn account of their small ton-   . nage.    The Italian Government were warned that their action must lead to a crisis in the coal situation with whioh .H.M. Government could hold out no prospect&apos; cf being able to cope.From the reply of H.H. Charge&apos; d1 Affaires, it would appear that the Italian Government realise the serious, effect which their policy will have on the coal eupply, but. that they consider it preferable to running the risk of a revolution duo to shortage of food-stuffs, although the lack cf coal will probably involve the shutting down cf blast furnaces, and the consequent curtailment of the output sf munitions,.I have discussed the. subject with Signor Arlotta, who has o.ome to London to- lay the seriousness of the food supply situation before the British Government,    I- gather, from him that the decision to divert coal steamers.to the grain trade was taken subsequent; to his departure from Rome..   He, agrees that to have taken such a. decision without --previously con-suiting H.M.. Government,.was a most mistaken.policy, but he urges that the position; be at once considered, with a View to seeing what steps- can be taken to relieve the situation by
the diversion of a few cargoes of grain to Italy, in order to reassure public opinion which has. become thoroughly alarmed at the prospect of famine.   If, after examination, it is found that some such relief - is called for and can be afforded, he has no doubt that as only a few of the ships have as yet-been actually diverted, the instructions for any further diversion can be cancelled.In these circumstances, I would suggest that- pending -the completion of the examination of the food situation in Prance and Italy, authority may be given to the Pood Controller to direct to Italy some prompt cargoes which would otherwise be despatched to this country, if such action can be taken without endangering the British supplies&apos;.(sd).
