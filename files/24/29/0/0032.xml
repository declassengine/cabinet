THI3 POCUIJgilT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHNIC I-^jqSgyS OOvT-pJlHigTE1j 3 C R E T.g.T.-gg,32. WAR CABINET.PROPOSED MI.SSIOB TO ROUMAlflA. Memorandum by Sir Edward Person.The situation brought about in Eoumania is one of the most doploreblo results, of the Russian collapse.     The material necessities of the Roumanian Government and people are most urgent, and msny complaints have been received from Jassy of the way&apos;in which Russia is evading the fulf:..3.mont even of such obligations ob it is still within her ability to perform.     Our own power of rendering material assistance is made difficult by Roumanians geographical position.     *.&apos;o have, however, done a good deal in this respect, especially in the matter of finance, besides giving diploma-tic Bupport at Potrograd to her demands on Russia, but the efforts we have made and are making  ire little undorstood by the Roumanian people, and it is highly desirable that the latter should be:as fully acquainted as possible with whet England is in feet doing on their behalf, tad with the difficulties which prevent her doing more.     It is also important to give every possiblo encouragement to tho Roumanian people to continue their resistance to the enemy, and to show them that their efforts to preserve a remnant of their Country from the invader have won the admiration  nd appreciation of the British Government and fiction.Hithorto little or nothing has been done to,bring these facts home to the Roumanian people, since our propaganda in that Country has been confined to the work of our Embassy, while the French Mission of General Bertholot has, on the other he-ndj placed Prance in a more favourable light than ourselves in Roumanian eyes.Under tho circumstances thore is much to be said, I think, for the suggestion that has been made to mo by Mr.Donald,&apos; Editor of the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, that tho present time is opportune for the despatch of i British Mission to Roumania.     The objects of such a Ivlission would be :-(a) To give proof of British sympathy with Roumania in the trials she is undergoing, ana to encourage her to continued resistance to the Enemy.(b) To protect British interests.(c) To organise British Propaganda in Roumania so far as practicable in tho present military situation.(d) To establish in Roumcnia an organisation corres-ponding to tho Anglo-Roumanian Society, to co-operate with the latter in fostering mutual good relations.(e) To collect information for tho British Government as to the best lines on which commercial assistance may be lendered to Roumania, and commercial relations between the two Countries encouraged for tho future.
The last-mentioned of these objects is of less urgency under existing conditions than the others, end may be regerdod as only incidental to tho more pressing work of the Mission.     But tho importance of giving Roumanians ocular demonstration of our Gollcitudo for their safety end of our determination that their integrity and independence shell be restored, with full roperation for the wrongs they have sufforod, cannot be ques bionod, especially in view of the fato that has hitherto bofalien tho small nations who havo joinod the lilies, end of our repeated declarations that the protection of these smell nations is one of our essential war aims.As the question   of assistance to Roumania has been under consideration by lord Milner, I submitted to him the suggestion   made tc me by Mr.Donald, end Lord MiInor has been good enough to propa.ro tho accompanying memorandum on tho subject, with vhich I concur.as&apos; to the personnel of the proposed Mission, it is submitted that it need not be numerors.     Mr,Donald^ suggestion that either Lord Hugh Cecil,. President of the Anglo-Bourne nian Society, or Mr .Mt ckinder, M.P., would be a suitable head of tho Mission, is endorsed by Lord Milner and Colonel Buchan, and the ncm.es of Mr. Deeper of the Department of Information, Mr.E,B.Medge and Mr.Mitrany, a Roumanian journalist, are mentioned as possessing qualifications for the work.It is important thet if tho proposal is to be adopted there should be no unnecessary delay in giving effect to it.I should bo gled, therefore, to know the views of my Colleagues in the War Cabinet as to the expediency of such a Mission being sent as soon as possible to lioumania.(Intd.)

Memorandum by L^rd Milner.I have read the papers on this subject and Colonel Buchan&apos;s comments of the 9th October.    I agree very largely with what he says-   ho doubt it would have been much better if our Mission could have gone a year a^o, and I dn not think there is much use in thinking,   just now about commercial developments after the war.    I quite agree that &quot;the urgent needs of Roumania are for food and military assistance&quot;, and that &quot;unless we canassure her of these, to talk about our interest in her future i3 rather like offering a stone for bread.&quot;But there are other arguments for the Mission if we can send a sufficiently strong one.    The Roumanians are much discouraged just now.    One of tiieir causes of discouragement is. &apos; that they think they are being forgotten by their western Allies,  or at any rate oy England.   As a matter of fact we are do..ng a great deal more for Roumania than is common3.y buppused.   Fo doubt Russia is the country which can d most tc make   ;rr mar her fortunes ,    This is especially true in the matv.or of food-   But we arc making constant and urgent represorr&apos;;a.t.&apos;...uu&quot; to che Russian Government, both cn this subject and w:-.\,h regard to other matters cn which the Roumanictns cc.iup.&apos;..ain of their treatment by Russia.And as regards military assistance) we have, in spite of all the enomorg difficult.!as against which we have to contend,  concinaed&apos;to send to Roua&amp;nxa some important military  b&quot;.ppj..r es.     We are s*c?.13  coing so - indeed only this wuc-k tho C.LG.S. has, under great pressure, agreed to send several batteries of 5 inch howitzers, very, very much needed by the Roumanians but difficult for us to spare.As regards finance, we have given Rcumania a credit of more than  20,000,000  .It is not, therefore, as if our Mission represented a purely platonic sympathy.   We are doing - under very great difficuBtJes and at the most enormous disadvantage, o^ing to distance and the miserable communications - what we can. If it was only to help the Roumanians to realise this and our disposition, and also to find out, as perhaps it might, that there are other ways of helping them which do not occur to us, I think the Mission would do good.But of course it must consist of the right people. It would be much better not to send a Mission at all than to send an inadequate one.    Of course if either Lord hugh Cecil or Professor Mackinder were willing to go at the Head cf it (l a.on&apos;t think it is necessary to send two men of such high standing.   Tnat seems rather waste when we are so short), that alone would make the Mission a weighty one.   I think that certainly .Mr. Leeper should go, and probably Mr. Madge.   I know nothing of Mr, Mitrani, but if he really is a &quot;capable Roumanian journalist&quot; I think he might be a valuable addition-   I am told he is a very clever man.(initialled)   M13th October, 1917
