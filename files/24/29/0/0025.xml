: liii        7?67jf       TENTH REPORT BT THE BOARD OF TRADE ON IMPORTSIN.RELATION TO SHIPPING.A Report has been prepared on Imports in relation to Shipping, which shows the position up to the end of September.   The outstanding points seem to be:-(1) In September the tonnage of goods imported amounted to 2,868^000 tons - a decrease of 24% on September 1916.   This decrease is larger than the correspond--  ing decrease i.e. 19% that took place in August, which itself was larger than the decrease for July, i.e. 16%.   The revised and greatly enlarged forecast of imports in September] which Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton made at the end of August on the basis of recent experience was   3,100,000 tons instead of 2,508,000 tons as forecasted in May.   The actual import fell short of this revised estimate by 232,000 tons or rather more than 7%. (2) Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton have prepared a forecast, necessarily, of course, based on very uncertain assumptions, of the imports which it wills, be possible to bring in in the year 1918.  These they estimate at 26,850,000 tons as compared with 35,400&apos;;000 tons estimated for 1917,   They thus anticipate a reduction of 24% on the estimated in--port of 1917 and of 39% on the actual import of 1916.(3) In September the imports placed upon the restricted lists were down 405,000 tons or 46% as against
1916 and by 77$ as against 1913.     The imports of unrestricted goods (including munition imports) were down by 496,000 tons or 17$ as against 1916 and by 18$ as against 1913.       In September the percentage contraction of unrestricted imports was much larger relatively to that cf total imports than it had been in August.      This is no doubt principal-ly accounted for by the fact that in September the imports of timber - which are of course restricted -were relatively very large. (4) The most important of the restricted imports is soft wood other than pitwood.    Of this the percentage contraction of 1916 was in September only 37$ as compared with 51$ in August and 71$ in July.    In the three months July - September 703,000 tons have been imported.  . /. Biarly in July there was fear that the total import for the year June 1917 - June 1918 might not exceed 765,000 tons.    The amount which the Timber Control at that time wished to import during the year was about 1,200,000 tons.      This could now be secured by an average monthly import of 53,000 tons for the nine months October - June.      The figure of 53,000 tons happens to coincide with the average for the three months March - May last, months during which the main timber ports were shut and both restriction and submarine activity were at their height,    As neutral tonnage is largely employed  -this import should be practicable without an undue strain on British tonnage.
(5) The pitwocd imports in September show a percentage contraction of 85$ on what they were in September, 1916.  Under the restriction scheme they are to fall to a minimoa in October.    In most parts of the country the situation of the home supplies is fairly good;  but it is not yet certain that some relaxation of the import restriction may not prove necessary if South Wales is to get through the winter.    The weather in Wales has interfered seriously with the hauling of native timber. (6)Among unrestricted goods, the imports of meat in Seotember showed the very large contraction of 46$ on September 1916,   This is much the largest that has taken place in any month of the year.   Following upon the abnormally heavy import of  July and August grain and flour also showed a large decline, 23$, as against September 1916.   The imports of raw wool were reduced much more seriously (43$) as against 1916 than they had been in any previous month:   but the total import of wool for the first nine months of 191V is only 3$ down on what it was in the corres-ponding period of 1916.   The import of raw cotton was 11$ greater in September 1917 than in September 1916. The position as regards Kerosene oil, to which attention has been called in previous Reports is still very unsatisfactory.   On October 4th the Ocean Stock was only 26,000 tons,:a,nd. the local stocks, (which cannot be reduced without serious danger of local shortage) between 219QQQ and 22,000 tons.   The estimated consumption for September is 34,600 tons, and would normally rise to upwards of 40,000 tons in October and.to upwards of 50,000 tons in December.
(7) For September as for previous months the reduction as against 1913 in tons of goods imported was much less than the reduction of tonnage entrances (with cargo) but the ratio of imports to entrances was decidedly less favourable than in August.   As against 1916 also the improvement in the ratio was much less than in August.(8) In September the entrances (with cargo) of British vessels, exclusive of certain specially requisitioned vessels, for which returns are available for the first time in June 1917, were 1,549,000 tons (i.e. 1% less than in September 1916)*   The position was thus slightly better than in August (when British entrances were 9% less than in 1916)a    British entrances from the North Atlantic route, which constitute about one-half of the whole, had in September increased 10% above what they were a year ago.    The explanation, of course, is that a substan-tial tonnage of British vessels has been transferred to this route from other employment,    British clear-ances (exclusive of requisitioned vessels) were 1,229,000 tons (i.e. 23% less than in September 1916)4(9) Foreign entrances in September ?/ere 315,000 tons (i.e. 62$ less than in September 1916).   The percentage reduction was thus the same as it had been in August.   The entrances of Allies other than the United States were worse relatively to 1916 than in any previous month of the year;   but the good relative position of United States entrances, which was remarked upon in the last Report, has been accentuated and maintained.    Foreign clearances were 748,000 tons (i.e. 51% less than in September 1916c)
(JO) From the &quot;beginning of January to the end of September the gross tonnage of merchant shipping lost by enemy action was, British 2,977,000 tons, Allied 932.^00 tons: Neutral 1,049,000 tons firing 4,958,^000 tons in all.   The aggregate worldfs loss from enemy action in September was 309,000 tons (made up of 184,000 British, 96,000 Allied, and 29,000 Neutral), which is less than in any month since September 1916.   During September, as in August and July the proportionate loss of neutral shipping was much less than it had been in earlier months. (11) During September the aggregate losses (including marine risk) of British steam merchant vessels over 500 tons from all causes was 200,000 tons.   This figure is a great improvement on the figure for August, when the aggregate losses amountedto 369,000 tons.   Indeed it is much smaller than the figure for any month of 1917 except January, and only a few thousand tons larger than that. The aggregate gains in September amounted to 121,000 tons, made up cf 78,000 tons of completed British built vessels, 11,000 tons of vessels purchased abroad, 21,000 tons of vessels traasferred from foreign flags and 11,000 tons of vessels released from the Baltic. The net loss during September thus amounted to only 7^,000 tons, which is much less than in any other month of 1917. (12)0n August 31st ac compared with July 31st thegrand total of all British Ste^m vessels over 1,600 tons had been decreased by approximately 150,000 tons. The total of vessels actually ro^dy for use had however, fallen by the much larger figure cf 272,000tons. -
tons.   This excess in the reduction of vessels ready for use was due to the fact that the tonnage of ves-sels repairing had arisen by 95,000 tons and that of vessels launched but not yet completed, by 26,000 tons.   The reduction in the tonnage of vessels ready for use had in the main been met by a reduction in the tonnage available for lM&apos;ued Kingdom trade (including munitions).   This tonnage had fallen by 213,000 tons. (13) In the week ending October 4 there were under con-struction on stocks in this country 1,332,000 tons of new shipping, and launched but not completed 467,000 tons; making in all 1,799,000 tons, of which 264,000 tons were oilers and 305,000 tons &quot;standard11 ships.   These figures do not, by themselves enable any estimate to be made o  the quantity of shipping that will become available for use within any given period of time.   It should be noted that, since we cannot indefinitely requisition and purchase neutral vessels, the bturden of replacing our losses is likely to fall more and more upon British building.   Jsven with the low rate of loss recorded for September -which can hardly be expected to continue - the annual reduction of tonnage would amount to 2i million tons. If, therefore, when new building has caught up the rate of loss, it is.sought to make good in any degree the wastage that has been suffered, a rate of annual building of at least 3  million -it may be 4 million tons - seems to be essential.12th October, 1917.(6)
