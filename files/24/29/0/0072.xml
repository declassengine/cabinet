(This Document \% the Property of &amp;d fi79 v.iHis HHtannic Majesty^ Government.)MATERNItX AND-&quot;INFANT WELFARE..71.     In my memorandum to the War Cabinet of the 9th August last I urged the importance of the introduction as early as possible of the Maternity and Child Welfare Bill, submitted by Lord Rhondda in June, to confer extended powers on local authorities in&apos;England and Wales in oonnec-tion with maternity and infant welfare work.The introduction of the Bill has been opposed by Oertain Insurance Organisations.on the quite untenable ground that it would prejudice the position as regards the suggested establishment of a Ministry of Health,   Proposals for the establishment of such a iiinistry have since been submitted to the far Cabinet, and formed the subjeot of a deputation to the Prime Minister on the 11th instant, when he indicated that the matter involved questions needing searching investigation and that the introduction of a Bill to establish a Ministry would lead to great controversy and could hardly be contemplated in the middle &apos;0f the war.Since the deputation the Prime Ministers declaration has been criticised in the Press, on the ground that the development and extension of maternity and infant Welfare work and the necessary measures for securing the Supply of milk to young children and nursing and expectant mothers, particularly during the present shortage, are dependent on the institution of a Health Ministry.*I have already pointed out the fallacy of these vOntentions.   Local Authorities under the existing.law can jio and have done a great deal  n the matter of maternity &amp;nd infant welfare.   But their powers are not sufficient )o enable them to meet all modern demands.   The Bill&apos;whichpredecessor submitted would empower the Local &apos; Government Board to sanction arrangements by local Authorities to meet the urgent need that exists in many districts for the  revision of lying-in homes, midwives,  ilk supplies and creches, all of which can now be provided by Scottish and Irish Local Authorities under the fotif ication of Births Act, 1915, with the sanction of the Scottish and Irish Local Government Boards.   Some of these powers would be of&quot; inestimable value during the coming  inter.   The Uar 6abinet decided many months ago that the Wers of local authorities in regard to infant&apos;welfare Should be enlarged, so as to enable them to provide Creches, and the ?jQard of Trade Committee on Prices in September last year-strongly advised that local authorities should be authorised, subject to safeguards, to&apos;provide toilk and dinners for expectant and nursing mothers, and jjnilk for infants and children under five years of age.   The Food, Controller has also quite recently impressed upon me tne desirability of &quot;making provision for the supply of milk during the winter to mothers and children who may be unable to purchase it at the increased prices fixed under the Milk Prices fe&amp;er&apos;.Itcportairl- Associations representing local authorities gave m*de strong representations to me urging that these powers sliould be conferred on local authorities at the pr^&amp;knt time, and have assured me that immediate ajid^fuli use will bs made of them.
The natural and legitimate development of the activities of local authorities in regard to public health ought not to be stopped pending any constitution of a new iepartment or reoonstitution of existing departments, with the re-organisation of services that these may involve, and nothing in the Bill which has been submitted would in any Way prejudice changes of this kind whioh the Government, might decide to Drake in future.I am sensible of the grave responsibility which would attach under present circumstances to His Majesty&apos;s Government for any failure to take all immediately available measures to conserve infant life,, and .1 have pledged myself to use my best endeavours to seoure that this Bill should become law before Christmas.   I must therefore urge upon my colleagues the need for introducing it at once. I have no fear of any Parliamentary opposition to such a much needed reform.3.    Another matter which has, I understand, been delayed pending the consideration of the question of a Ministry of Health, is the ratification by the Prime Minister of the agreement, whioh my predecessor came to with the President of the Board of Education in February last, for the transfer to the Local Government Board of oertaia infant welfare work hitherto supervised by the Board of Education. In the interests both of economy and of effioienoy, I am satisfied that infant welfare work should be treated as a whole and should not be divided between two Departments. Experience has shown that by plaoing the work under two Departments, friction, .;aste and loss of efficiency are inevitable.   The agreement was subject to ratification by the Prime Minister, but that has not yet been reoeived.   Ihe agreement does not in any way depend on the question of a Ministry of Health and its ratification would not affect or prejudice any future development in that direction.W. HAYES FISHER.I strongly endorse the views expressed in the foregoing Memorandum.As a Labour &quot;Member of the Government and a Trade Union Representative, I have no hesitation in saying th*t, apart from and without prejudice to, the larger question of a Ministry of Health the Local Health Authorities in this Country which are representative, and possess the -c-onfidence, of all sections of the community, and particularly of Labour, should be given the powers necessary to continue the Infant Welfare Work, of which they are already doing so much, unhampered &quot;by restrict ions whioh do not exist in ttoo1&amp;an&amp;. and Ireland.STEPHEN WALSH.23rd October,.1917.
