(This Document is the Property of   ^r&quot;t&quot; ^r7^&apos;&apos; His Britannic Nlajesty&apos;8 Government) 127/4y^f*&apos;    &apos; . &apos; &apos;&quot;v.v7 v/ JT7ar Cabinet, Ftosjiaja Volunteer Army. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,Professor Pares, Professor of the Liverpool University, who has had much previous experience of Russia and who has &quot;been with the Russian Army since the commencement of the war, has handed me the enclosed memorandum which may he of interest to Members of the 17ar Cabinet,I have seen Professor Pares and he is confident that a very considerable Volunteer Army could be raised on the lines he suggests, but certain assistance would have to be given from this Country before it could beeome very effective,     I have told him, and I hope in that I have the Cabinet1s approval, that it would be quite impossible for us to volunteer to the Russian Government to do what he suggests, but that if asked for such assistance officially *re would do our best to give it,DERBY,18,10,17.
\lA Ue:iOTandxs,\ on theRuseian Volunteer Army.bjrProf,. Parea^.This movement arises :(l)   out of the need for a more conscious discipline in the Army, as produced &quot;by the Revolution,(2)   out of the disruption of discipline in the existing army and the consequent disasters.Its object is twofold : (a)   to send up new and t?ioroughly disciplined units to the front,(b^   to persuade existing units to take the very strict volunteer o/*thB,Its originators are all convinced adherents of the Revolution, principally from the Socialist parties:   they are officers and men in the Army and $avy.The programme of the movement is strictly non-party, all-class, and all-Russian.     It declares clearly for war till com-plete victory in absolute union with the allies, the strictest discipline, allegiance only to the Provisional Government, obedience only to the military chiefs,.no regimental committees except for household purposes, exclusion of all who break this oath, also for the rights of smaller peoples.On these lines sprang up many small organising units suchas -The League of Personal Example, The League of Knights of St,George, The League of Wounded Soldiers, The League of escaped prisoners (from Germany), The Delegation of the Black Sea 3?leet (70 organisers) The League to save the Country, and several other bodies.These are now all united into the semi-official All Russian Central Volunteer Committee, which is recognised as the department of the Russian War Office for the given purpose, and was asked by the Corumander-in-Chief (General Kornilov) to conduct work under his supervision at his Head Quarters.The attitude of this Committee towards England is of the most cordial character.     It looks to us as the experts in Volunteer armies, for every help and counsel, of the most intimate character possible, that we are able to give,     I have been asked to act on it as connocting it with England,     I have already for some time been closely connected with this work, and feel sure that such intimate work in the reconstruction of the^ Russian Ar: y is our most fitting answer to the wholesale attempts of German agents for its dissolutionThe Committee has 3.2 recruiting points in Russia which increase in number every day:   yesterday Vladivostok opened a branch and sent up volunteers.     So far some 50,000 men have been sent up in this way and about 4,000 women volunteers inspecial
speoial   ^oraen1 s &quot;battalions.     Ten battalions have taken part in stemming the German advance on the South Western Front:   of many, only 90-100 men per battalion are left, tout this has of itself increased the velocity of the movement which is now taking big public dimensions.     Two battalions have so far been sent up to the Northern Front;   one took four lines of German trenches but was fired on by *unconverted1 Russian troops from behind and suffered the same losses as above (the Revel Death Battalion):    it is now being reformed.     A women18 battalion did -notable work at a somewhat lesser cost on the South Western fronts. The movement however is only now beginning to take J&amp;sjZull shapo.     I have visited a battalion on a field day        two weeks&apos; training and, comparing with the army previous to the Revolution., I was struck by the remarkable esprit de corps and even by the military results obtained in so short a time.     (I witnessed several hours1 work, a sham attack of about half a mile in open order, &quot;and the march past:   the return march was good to the finish).     The olaims of discipline are stronger in this battalion than in ante-Revolution units and the men are asking for more work. They had had armed combats with unsound units, to which their hostility was greater than I have seen with any other section of the population.His excellency the Ambassador has authorised me to give anywhere a special greeting to these troops, as has also the Senior Military Attache (General Knox)..I venture to submit that we have every political and military reason for giving the strongest moral and, where possible, material support to this movement which, under the direct and non-party sanction of the military authorities can consolidate all the friends of the Allies and more particularly of England in Russia.I have submitted, with the authorisation of the Russian Committee, a prospective programme to the Ambassador and to General Knox which, after the corresponding official approaches from the Russian side, might- include the following -A*     Hen,(l) Permission to the Assistant Military Attaches to act as consultants on volunteer discipline and organisation to the Russian Committee.(2)   The services, if desired and found practicable, of carefully selected British military instructors, especially with regard to the points mentioned in (A.l), as having a political importance much greater than might be realised by those unaoquainted with present Russian conditions.I ought to point out that there are many matters of discipline which have in the British Army long since passed into common instinct and ordinary habit but which in the Russian Army at the present moment are questions of importance in the military education of the men,     A wise use by us   of such an opportunity as is now offered must have lasting effects ef great value on the ties between England and the Russian Army and people.(3) . The services of a British expert of volunteer organisation with first rate experience, such for instance as Right Hon. Harold Baker, M.P., to act as a consulting expert on such matters at the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief.B.
(B)   Means.(l)   The application to this Committee (for purposes of propaga-nda) of those sums whioh have previously &quot;been contributed by the Anglo-Russian Commission far the same purpose to another Russian body (the Duma Committee) possessing less of a non-party character (on this point I have the agreement in principle of\ Dr. Williams, Acting President of the Commission).(2)   The expression by the British Military Authorities ,of a desire that the volunteer units (^hich have so fak sometimes suffered as compared with other units in t^e matter of equipment) may profit as mush aa is found possible by the help which England gives in the way of equipment to Russia, as units which can be depended on to make good use of such help.Th* Russian Committee requests, through me,(a) all materials for popularising the volunteer idea which have been found valuable in England, in particular^tan or more copies of the most successful war posters,(b) any literature, especially text books on the organisa-tion,  construction and regulations of volunteer units, and especially any relating to their discipline.(Sd0)   Bernard Pares,Petrograd,August 16th, 1917,
4 9 i101Appendix I.Professor Pares submitted with his memorandum on the organization of a Volunteer Array in Russia the following documents : -1.     Army Order ITo. 439 dated 26th July, 1917, sanctioning the formation of Storm Battalions, composed of Volunteers drawn from the ranks of the Army and of Civilians over 17 years of age, and physically fit for service.     Soldiers, however, are not allowed to volunteer without the consent of the Officer Command-ing the Unit to which their belong.The Volunteers are formed in Battalions about 1,000 strong, the Commanding Officers are appointed by the Committees subject to the approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the Front,The men take a special oath, one of the clauses of which stipulates that they will never be taken alive, they wear a special red and black badge, red to signify their allegiance to the revolution and black to indicate that they are ready to die for their country.     The men and their families are granted certain privileges in the way of compensation and separation allowances.29    A pamphlet dascribing the composition of the All-Russian Central Committee with Headquarters at Petrograd which has been formed for the purpose of organizing Volunteer Units in the centre of Russia0   It is divided into four sections, viz. (a) Organization.     (b) Propaganda.     (c) Finance.     (d) Audit. Its purpose is to foster the Volunteer movement among the Russian population, and to strengthen the Revolutionary spirit of the Ration and revive the morale of the Array,     The Volunteers are to be specially trained, and it is hoped that their conduct in presence of the enemy will induce others to follow their example aiid that by that means the moral of the Russian Army may be gradually restored,3.     A copy of the instructions given to the Commissaries sent out by the Central Committee, which has representatives in all the large centres in Russia and even in Siberia, to carry on n active recruiting propaganda in various towns by addressing eetings, and making great use of the Press and of the local political organizations.The Commissaries establish recruiting bureaus and appoint local reoruiting Committees who daily report progress to the Central Committee and state the number of Volunteers they have despatched to the front.4.    A copy of the poster beginning with the words - &quot;TThat will you answer to your chilJren when they ask you &quot;Father, where were you when the Germans were ravaging Russia&quot;M and continues in the same strain &quot;Listen to the voice of your conscience and to that of the Council of V/orkmen and Soldiers.&quot;.   A number of these stirring appeals and striking posters have been published by the Central Committee which read more or less like our own recruiting appeals.   It is well to note that these appeals and posters were published three months ago, when the Council of Workmen was not so much in the hands of the Bolshevik! as it Is now.     They would doubtless be worded somewhat differently now. There is nothing in the documents to show there is any intention on the part of the Central Committee or of the Government of forming a volunteer army in Russia,   The Battalion is the largest unit contemplated and the purpose of these Battalions appears to.be clearly indicated by the name they bear.
