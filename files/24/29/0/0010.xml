inConclusions of Conference,At a meeting this afternoon at the Foreign Office, d attended by M. Painleve, M. Franklin Bouillon, Lord Curzon, General Smuts, and myself, on the subject of Japanese military assistance in the war, it was agreed to recommend the following course to the Cabinet(l)     The1 Allies, and in particular America should be sounded as to whether they were willing to encourage Japanese military assistance if the Japanese were willing to grant it.(2)     If the answer to this question was in the affirmative and before sounding the Japanese, investigation should be made into the question of transport, with a view of determining whether Japanese assistance on the Western Front, if otherwise possible, waB possible under existing tonnage conditions.(3)     If the answer was in the negative it was only in secondary theatres that Japanese assistance could be utilized, for the employment of Japanese troops in Russia under present conditions was deemed out of the question.In these circumstances there would only be three theatres of operations requiring consideration:   Salonika, Palestine, and Mesopotamia.     The main objections to Salonika were: (a)   it required tonnage, though not nearly to the same extent as France;   and (b) bo far as we oould foresee it did not promise to be the Bcene of any such striking military successes as would alone tempt the Japanese to send an army to the other side of the world.     The objection to PaleHcine was that the employment of Japanese troops in a new Crusade for the recovery of the Holy Places would shock European public opinion.     The objection to Mesopotamia was that if, on the one hand, General Maude maintained a defensive position at Bagdad, Japanese troops would scarcely be required unless new troops were brought against him;   while, on the other hand, if a great offensive operation were attempted with Bagdad as its base, though Japanese assistance would certainly be required, it seemed more than doubtful whether it would be given to further an enterprise eo long and so hazardous.^       On the whole, the opinion of the Committee was that, while France and Mesopotamia seemed at first sight to be the two theatres Qf war where Japanese co-operation would give the best promise of good results the first might be rendered impossible by the lack of tonnage, while in the second Japanese assistance, if given, might probably prove useless.     It ie obvious that to employ Japanese troops where they are not wanted is to provide Japan with new claims to consideration and to get nothing in return.(Initialled)      A.
