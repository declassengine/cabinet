/      ) &quot;1 -ii     iHte Britannic MaJ-*ty&apos;3 O^-rhfnent.)Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BPtf/019.Report. q:n the Occupied Russian Previnced. Uti&amp;t.(25th October, 1917.)0ourland.Detailed information now tc hand confirms the supposition which v/e expressed in the report of October 4 that the Government of Courland &quot;will be handed over to the small clique of the notorious German 1Baltic Barons&apos;, whilst the Letts, who form almost 90 per cent of the population, v/ill receive a merely nominal share in it&quot;.     The Germane, who form exactly 6  per cent of the popular tion of Courland, hold 18 out of the 20 seats in the new Council, tne remaining 2 members are &quot;tame Letts&quot; - half Germanised and absolutely unrepresentative.     Yet even of these one protested against any partitioning of Lett territory - the larger, southern part of Livonia also is inhabited by Letts.Lithuania.Also our general forecast of the territories likely to be assigned by the Germans to the new Lithuanian Council appears to have been accurate.     This territory will include the Government of Kovna, and cf the Government of Vilna, the town and district of Vilna and the district of Troki, but not that of Lida.     The districts of Svientsiany and Oshmiana, the two remaining districts of the Government of Vilna now in German occupation, are within the closest y/ar zone and are almost certain te remain under the immediate administration of the Army Command.     The Government of Grodna will not be subject to the Lithuanian Council, whilst
nothing is known so far concerning the Government of Suvalki; yet it seems very likely that the Germans will hand over at least the northern, purely Lithuanian half of it to the Lithuanians, especially as the Russian provisional GovasailM.it, probably misled by the Poles, has committed the fatal blunder of assigning the whole of that province to ihe Polish liquidation Committee.     This inequitable arrangement has been strongly criticised and unanimous-ly condemned at the Congress of Nationalities held at Kiev towards the end of September and. unless reversed, may seriously complicate the Lithuanian problem for Russia and help the German intrigues.Judging from the frontiers assigned to the new Lithuanian State it seems that the Germans have dropped the White Russian intrigue and hardly count any longer on engineering a White Russian separatist movement against Russia-     The natural capital of Lithuanian Lithuania is Kovna, and not Vilna, where the Lithuanians form an absolutely negligible percentage of the population.     Only the northern and western fringes of the Government of Vilna are inhabited by Lithuanians, in the centre there are small Polish enclaves, whilst the bulk of the population of the Government is White Russian.     Of course it pleases the Lithuanian jingoes to have the old traditional capital of Lithuania and its surroundings included in the new State, although on grounds of nationality the Lithuanians have no right to it.     This measure, however, has naturally caused general indignation among the White Russians. Even the White Russian daily Homan, which in the past has had suspiciously close connections with the German authorities, pro-tests against this partitioning of the White Russian districts, of which the smaller part is now subject to the new Lithuanian Council, whilst by far the larger portion, the Government of Grodna, the district of Lida and the western parts of Minsk are left under the German military administration.   Ho doubt this protest is inspired
not merely by resentment at the subjection of the one part to the Lithuanian Council, but also by the fear that the remaining districts will be included in the new Polish State, a contingency which the V/hite Russians fear more than anything.Thuo the new German intrigue in the East is assuming concrete shapes.     Russia may yet get back all the Wiite Russian and even the Lithuanian provinces at the price of peace; the Germans them-selves so far said nothing about Lithuanian independence, and the Russians have already promised to the Lithuanians national autonomy. But if the Russians get back the Lithuanian provinces they will get them back with the minds of the Lithuanian Nationalists poisoned by extravagant claims to V/hite Russian districts.     Should, however, Russia persist in refusing German peace offers the White Russians v/ill be thrown to the wolves, i.e., to the Polioh and Lithuanian imperialists.     A Lithuania including Vilna and a Poland including Grodna and probably aloo the Little Russian, eastern districts of Cholm and western Volhynia, will be hopelessly dependent on German oupp ort.The two currents, the one favouring an understanding with Ruooia by means of retroceding the occupied provinces in the east, and the other which. wishes to secure the oupport of the Polish nationalists at the price of satisfying their impudent imperialist claimo, are both prominent in the German press.     Thuo for instanco the Radical member of the German Reichctag, Herr Gothein, returns in the Berliner Tageblatt of September 27 to his favourite idea of a big Polish State including all the provinces of Russia now under German occupation.     Max Cohen in the Sozialistische Monatshefte, on the other hand, warns Germany not to risk light-heartedly an irreparable break with Russia by depriving her of provinces, which she can never renounce.In view of the untiring intrigues- carried on by the Pole^s in western Europe and openly aiming at detaching the Lithuanian and
White Russian provirices from Ruooia, it iu, important to note the declaration made by M. Tereshchenko to a French journalist and re-published in the Morning Ppst of September 26.     He stated that &quot;the Provisional Government fully approved of the complete in-dependence of Poland&quot;, and that for the full economic independence Of Poland &quot;access to the sea was imperative&quot;, but that &quot;this could not be granted in Lithuania, which province must remain within the boundaries of the Russian Republic.&quot;     &quot;Lithuania,* M. Tereohchenko declared, &quot;just as all other territories in Russia inhabited by different nationalities, would receive the moot far-reaching autonomy, especially regarding language, religion, schools, administration and extensive rights of decision in local matters.     There must, however, be only one Central Duma for the whole republic.&quot;     These are words to which certainly every honest Russian without any difference of politico will subscribe. Poland.No new developments of any importance to report.An Opposition Movement in the Polish Army Corps in Russia.The regimental committee and the committees of the different companies in the First Reserve Regiment of the Polish Fusiliers, stationed at Rielgorod and described as 16,000 men strong, have-sent a request to the Russian Minister for V/ar to be changed into a division which &quot;forming part of the Russian Army would in no way differ from it in its internal structure&quot;.     They declare that they are determined to go &quot;hand in hand with the Russian Revolution in its struggle against German imperialism&quot;, but that they consider it inadmissible &quot;that their fate should rest in the hands of the Polish reactionaries represented by the Supreme Polish Military Committee&quot;.     (This Committee had been elected at the Polish Military Congress at Petrograd after the democratic Left had with-drawn from it and most of its members are National Democrats.)General Dov/bor-Musnicki, who has been chosen by that Committee
^7(9LB.H.25/10/17.to Command the FirBt Polish Army Corps, ^on account of this and other incidents AoBKtiidensb that a penal expedition should be sent against the First Reserve Regiment of the Polish Fusiliers, but the commander of the garrison of Bielgorod, the Russian Government Commissary of the district and the local Soviet all confirmed that perfect order prevailed in the regiment.     UA11 the soldiers,&quot; they say, &quot;are full of enthusiasm, prepared to fight Kaledin (this wire was sent at the time when an attack by Kaledin was expected in the military district of Moscow] and to uphold the Russian Revolution.     We protest against the insinuations of General Dowbor-Musnicki and consider the sending of a penal ex-pedition perfectly unnecessary.&quot;
