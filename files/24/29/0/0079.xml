Bri tish Armies- in France .,242 (D.M.O.)Sir, .Mth reference to the Chief of the Imperial General Staffs Memorandum B.E.F. .2/21 of the, 24th August last re-lative to the formation;of a separate Air Service, I am commanded by the Army Council to inform you that the question has recently received the further consideration of the War, Cabinet.-    Having regard to the fact that this separate Air Service cannot be formed for a period of time at present impossible to define,  it has been decided, as.an interim arrangement, to appoint a Committee consisting of the 1st Lord of the Admiralty,  the-Secretary of State for War, and the President of the Air Board, with General J.C. Smuts as Chairman,, to advise the War Cabinet on all questions relating to Air Policy..2.   An important feature of the duties of this Committee is to deal with all offensive aerial operations,,. whether naval or military, against German territory as distinct from Military objectives immediately in -front of your lines and aerial operations^of precise naval importance.     You have already received from the Chief of the Imperial General.Staff certain instructions (0.1/123/352 of the 2nd.instant) in this connection-,  and it should be understood that the present letter is not intended in any. way to modify them.3...   The Committee have decided that.; it- is necessary to take forthwith such measures as are required in order to prepare for an aerial offensive on a much greater, scale next year, and for this it is essential that the organization of aerodromes, quartersdepots, - communications, etc., and a comprehensive and close study&quot; of all. the factors:involved.in these.contem-plated operations., should be commenced at once.. . The. Committee are impressed by the views put forward in your. Memorandum 0 .B. 2097 of the 15th September last regarding the relation-^ ship between yourself: and air detachments employed across the Western front in carrying out. special operations of the nature here in question.;- For this and other reasons they have decided- that any force which it may be possible to place in France or Belgium, for the purpose of these operations shall, whether belonging to the Army or the Navy, be under your Command,
4.     As the force will be assigned a special mission, and as the preparation and execution of the operations would throw ah undue strain on the Staff of the Royal Plying Corps with the Expeditionary Force,  it is deemed desirable to appoint at / once a, separate Commander v/ho, acting under your orders, can give his whole- time to tbe duty and enter into the various questions with your Staff and, under your direction, with the ; French authorities.     Further, as the units detailed may, until the Air Service is formed, belong wither to the Navy or Army or *   to both, it is considered that the second-in-command should be. a&apos; naval officer.5.     The most suitable officer as Commander is left for your consideration.   The names of naval officers as second-in-command will later&quot;, be suggested by the. Board of Admiralty.. The Council would be glad, if you would submit your recommehda-tions at an early date.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (sd).     R.H. BRADS.
il.&quot;.&quot;Copy of/letter from the Field^MarshaJ. Commanding-in-* Chief. British Armies In France to the Secretary, far Office,        !0.B./2097. GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,BRITISH ARMES IN PRANCE-,-   22nd October, 1917,Sir,I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of War Office letter No. 87/1242 (D.M.O) of the 18th.instant, informing me that the War Cabinet has appointed a Committee to advise them on questions relating to Air Policy, and that one of the principal duties of this Committee will be to deal with all offensive aerial operations against German territory, as distinct from Military objectives immediately in front of the British lines.I also note that all the aerial forces engaged in prose-outing these offensive operations from FRANCE, or BELGIUM will be under my command.2,      As reported in former communications, the instructions received from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (0.1/123/352 of the&apos; 2nd, Instant) have been carried,out, and the 41st Wing, R.F.C., consisting at present of one. day bombing and two night bombing squadrons, is now operating, from OCHEY, six miles south of TOUL,3.      With regard to the measures which the Committee desire should be undertaken forthwith, all necessary preparations were commenced in July last, and are now completed or in hand.4.       It is necessary that the General Officer   Commanding Royal Flying Corps In the Field, should remain responsible to me for the operations of the whole of the aerial forces In FRANCE -P and for working out the detailed plans necessary to carry out the instructions of the War Cabinet as regards.long distance bombing, but the Officer appointed to command the bombing squadrons will be given a very free hand in carrying out the operations.The 41st Wing is how under the command of, Lieut.-Colonel C.L.N,Newall, R.F.C., who was specially,selected&apos;for the appoint-ment.     He, Is the next Wing Commander in FRANCE for appointment as Brigadier,&apos; and I have every intention of recopnending him for promotion as soon as sufficient bombing squadrons are available to enable me to expand the 41st Wing into a Brigade.    When additional bombing brigades are formed hereafter, It may become necessary to appoint a Major-General in command of the whole, in order to limit the number:of formations to be dealt with direct by the G.O.C., R.F.C. in the field,&apos;
5       As regards Naval Squadrons lent to the Army, at present the G?0,C., R.F.C. has a Naval Officer on his Staff to deal with the administrative work in connection with these. This arrangement meets existing needs, hut should a number of bombing squadrons of the Royal Naval Air Service be placed under my command, I should be glad of the services of a Naval Officer as ?.rIng, or if necessary, Brigade Commander.   In my opinion this arrangement would be altogether preferable to appointing an Officer as second-in-command of the long distance bombing squadrons, to which course there are very strong objections, both in principle and practice,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sd.)     D.HAIG.FieId-Marshal, Commanding-iri-Chief, . BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE
