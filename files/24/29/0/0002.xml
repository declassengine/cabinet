/SECRET.Operations.From.:   General Barter, G.Q.G. Russia.To:CI.G,SWar Office.12th October, 1917.1303.This afternoon I received visit from Alexeieff.He has &quot;been here attending the Council of Ministers at their deliberations on question of reforms to be introduced into army.     They have arrived at programme which has been accepted by Minister of YJar, who thinks they will not meet with much opposition from various army political organizations. These reforms have in view restoration of discipline and fight-ing quality of the army.Alexeieff thinks Government has really reached point where deeds seem likely to replace words.     He has asked not to be sent to Paris Conference as proposed by Government, because he thinks his proper place, in view of present critical situation, is in Russia where his services may be required at any (one group undecipherable).    He informed me that early this morning Germans had succeeded in landing forces at certain points on islands of Osel and Dago.     Considerable enemy naval foreos assisted, Y/hich he was informed included 3rd and 4th squadrons from North Sea.     He could give no details except that fighting was proceeding.
