Si/This Document Is the Property ofHlJ BHtannic fiflajesty^ Government)A 1SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. BPw/Ckl8.Weekly Report on Poland.   XVIII. ! (19th October, 1917-)The Situation in Russian Poland.When the Patent of September 12 concerning the new Polish Government was published, the membership of the Regency Council seems to have been already determined in an understanding with the Central Powers.    Nevertheless the first news of their official instalment reaches us only in a Timee telegram from Amsterdam dated October 16.     The most probable explanation for this long delay i3 that before the new Regency Council was.; officially recognised by the Central Powers, an agreement had to be reached concerning its first programmatic declaration, in \vhatever form that wi&amp;iL be- made.     It may be inferred from different semi-official Mrfts and denials that the Central Poweru wished the Regency &quot;Council to conclude an alliance with them and declarem --war on RU?D&quot;Bii, and that the Regency Council refused to do so on the irrefutable piea that the Polish government; having been refused the right to diplomatic intercourse with foreign States, and foreign affairs having been withdrawn from its competency,could not possibly take a step of that kind.     We must naturally withhold further judgment on the situation until we receive the programmatic declaration of the Regency Council, and until wo know the person of the future Premier and the composition of tho Cabinet and the Council of State.     It seems however likely that the froedom of the Poles in determining the membership of these bodies will stand in an inverse ratio to their freedom from any4
binding obligations with regard to the Central Powers,    If they refuse to enter such obligations, the Germans will try to oafe-guard themselvea in tho choice of the men who are to carry on the administration of the new State.     As foreshadowed in our report of August 10, Prince Drucki-Lubecki seems to be the German candidate for the Polish Premiership. The Situation in Galicia.At the price of concessions made to them by the Austrian Government, the Poles in the Reichsrat voted for the budget. Thus they once more deserted the Czechs and Jugo-Slavs, and, joining hands with the Germans, saved the Austrian Government from defeat.     Details of that bargain are not yet to hand.L.B.N.19/10/17.
