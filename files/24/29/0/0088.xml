-   -I pointed out, after this Committee was formed, that it would he difficult to consider priority of materiel apart from priority of labour.On the 10th October, the V*ar Cabinet decided that the Aerial Operations Committee should settle all questions of priority, not only for the present Air programme, but fpr all other Munition programmes, and should be known as the war Priorities Committee;    that their proceedings should he notified to the Viar Cabinet., and all decisions of tho Committee communicated to the Minister of Rational Service.I understood that the function of this Committee would be to determine, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, what classes of Munitions are to have priority, having regard to the strategical situation, to stocks in hand, and the material available;   and that it would be my duty to review the man-power situation and make recommendations to tho Man-Power Committee of the Cabinet give effect to the policy of the War Priorities Committee.At a meeting of the :-ar Priorities Committee on 10th October, a statement was made by the Minister of Munitions, that a departmental Committee of that Ministry had reported that the supply of labour for future air-craft demands could only be adequately met by withdrawing skilled labour at present employed in other departments on less essenti-1 work*The Committee decided that a permanent Sub-Committee should be established to investigate in detail all&apos; recom-mendations as to reduction of output in one direction and advance in another, and to report as. to the best way in which effect eould be given to such recommendations.    Such investigations probably must involve questions of Man-powerThey also approved a proposal that a small body of three or four men should he appointed to go into Labour Dilution as a whole, so far as the production of munitions is involved, end&quot; to advise the three departments as to what further dilution is possible.    The Secretary of State for &apos;..&apos;ar suggested that one member of this body should be the nominee of the Minister of National Service and represent both that &quot;Ministry and. the v.ar Office.These are, I submit, clearly questions which fall within the scope of the Man-power Committee, for it is that Committee which must, in the last resort, decide the conflicting claims of Government Departments that cannot be adjusted by the Ministry of National Service; and, in order to decide such claims, the Man-power Committee would have to consider whether Dilution had been carried on to the fullest possible extent,Further, action on these lines must involve a review of the Schedule of Protected Occupations, and the organisation and supply of female labour.    This is oure Man-power and Recruiting,
I feel very strongly that, unless some clear delimitation is given of the functions of the \mr PrioritiesGemini ctec, there will he serious over-* lapping, and difficulties are bound to arise if two Committees&apos; are responsible fur Man-power *    and we shall inevitably drift back Into the conflict of competing authorities which the establishment of the Man-power; Committee and the reconstruction of the Ministry of National Service were designed to prevent.Yours sincerely;(Signed)     A.
