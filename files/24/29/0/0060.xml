5,   At their Meeting on i Friday., September 2.1st-. 1917, tbi War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by General Smuts (G.T.2062) and certain correspondence between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Sir Douglas Haig (G.T.2058) as to Aerial Operations.The War Cabinet decided that as there was considerable difference of opinion as to facts, it was essential that the matter should be further considered, and requested -General Smuts (Chairman), Lord Derby, Sir Eric Geddes, ivir. Churchill, Lord Cowdray, Major L. Storr (Secretary) to form a Committee to enquire, at the earliest possible date, into the conditions that prevailed, and to report to them as soon as possible on the whole situation, giving their recom-rnendations as to priority end the effect that any priority, if granted, would have on the output of the Army and Navy and in what direction.6.   At their Meeting on 8th October, 1917 (War Cabinet 246, Minute 20) the War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by myself (G,2,2178) recommending that the Aerial Operations Committee should be empowered to settle all questions of priority, not only of the present air programme, but of all other munition programmes, and suggested that if this oro-posal were approved that the title of the Committee should be altered from Aerial Operations Committee to War Priorities Committee.The War Cabinet decided(a) That the title of General Smuts1 Committee should be altered from Aerial Operations Committee to War Priorities Committee::(b) That they should be given extended powers as recommended by the Committee:(o)   That their proceedings should be notified to the War Cabinet:(d)   That all decisions of the Committee should be notified regularly to the Ministry of National Service.7.   At the same Meeting, the War Cabinet considered a memorandum by General Smuts (G.T*2H22) suggesting that a communication should be made to the Press regarding the formation of an Air Ministry,The War Cabinet decided,to adjourn the discussion so as to allow General Smuts to examine the question further.8.   At their testing on October 1st, 1917 (War Cabinet 242A. Minutes 1 &amp; 2) the War Cabinet further considered the question of Home Defence against Air Haids, and decided:-That a Committee consisting as follows:-General Smuts (in the Chair)Minister of Munitions:President of the Air 3osrd:Director General of Military Aeronautics:Msster General of the Ordnance:Major-General Ashmore:Major L.

(War Cabinet 243, Minutes 12 and 13),  the Report of the above Committee was submitted to the Cabinet.The War Cabinet further   decided that the above Ccm-mittee should be asked to go into the whole question of counter-attacks; with special regard to the organisation of such attacks; the formations to be adopted; the types to be used; the rno3t suitable times for the attacks to be carried out; and the nature of the attacks to be delivered both by land and sea; submitting at the earliest possible date their recommendations to the War Cabinet.9.   At their Meeting on October 15th, 1917 (War Cabinet 249, Minute 15) I made a statement to the War Cabinet reviewing the progress made by my Committee on Air Re-Organisation. The War Cabinet -(a) decided that a reply should he given to Mr. Kennedy Jones&apos; question to the Prime Minister (G.T. 2283) to the effect that a Bill was in preparation and would, it was hoped, be shortly introduced, designed to co-ordinate the two Air Services and to provide for the eventual setting up of an Air Ministry, and that in the meantime, General Smuts would continue, on behalf of the Cabinet, to supervise the Air Services.(b) Approved General Smuts&apos; suggestion that a Committee should be appointed to assemble at once, composed as under to advise the War Cabinet oij all questions relating to Air Policy -General Smuts (in the Chair) First Lor a of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War.

It will be seen that in one or two cases,  the terms of reference to one Committee are,  to some extent,  covered by ref reference to a previous Committee: in other cases the work of the Committee is concluded or suspended,  or the name has been changed.-   In order to obviate any possibility of confusion I think it may be convenient if I briefly define the present designations and functions of the Committees as now constitutedo-   (1) AIR RAIDS COMMITTEE:L&quot;,m&apos;&quot;     &quot;     .....      1        &quot; iiThis Committee has submitted its recommendations to the War Cabinet and effect has been and is bein?^ given to all those recommendations.
