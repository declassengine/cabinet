/f&apos;^^^   ^^%[iiann!c Majesty&apos;.? Government) ^J  SECRET. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information, DBW/017.WEEKLY REPORT ON BULGARIA. XVII.(19 October, 1917).Internal Politics.The Sabraniye reassembled on October 15 for the first time since its prorogation on April 5.     There is, of course,  as yet no news to hand as to its activities, but the session is likely to be a stormy one.   Unfortunately, during the past month the Bulgarian papers have not arrived and consequently there is no evidence from them as to political developments in the country, but some idea of what has been going on may be gathered from the statements of Bulgarian politicians in foreign newspapers and from the views put before our agents abroad by Bulgarian propagandists and journalists.       It may be well to summarise the conclusions which may be dra?m from these sources.Bulgaria&apos;s Relations   with her Allies.As might be expected every Bulgarian who converses with our agents emphasises the fact that Bulgaria is tired of the war and that the population hates and fears its German Allies more than it does the Entente Powers.     This is partly due to the fact that the Bulgarian nation wss cajoled into intervention by the promise that the war would be a short and decisive one, that it would obtain for Bulgaria the territory she coveted in the Balkans, and that It would leave her in the fortunate position of being tho strongest and most advantageously situated Balkan State, an alliance with whom would be desired not only by tho Central Powers but ultimately by their opponents.      With the capture of
Ifonaetir these hopes seemed to he fulfilled, and It was with considerable difficulty that the Bulgarian peasants were persuaded to continue a war for aims which they did not understand. The intervention of Rumania, however, at the end of August, 1916, again offered a tempting bait to Bulgarian chauvinist ambitions, and now for a year past two-thirds cf Serbia, Greek Eastern Macedonia, and the whole of Dobrogea have been in Bulgarian hands.     From a territorial point of view, therefore, there is nothing further for Bulgaria to gain, even In the eyes of the most chauvinistic BulgarianFurtheri the economic situation is disquieting.   This was dealt with to some extent In the last Report.     It is true there is not an entire absence of food, for on the whole the harvest has not been a bad one, but certain indispensable commodities, such as cotton and leather, are almost entirely lacking.     The population Is, therefore, living in extreme discomfort.The financial position of the country Is also a gloomy one. The national debt has been at least trebled, and if the war continues the country is faced with bankruptcy.     Its one resource is the permanent financial support of some great Power, and in.the event of Bulgaria remaining in her present alliance that Power can only be Germany.   Some account of the energy Gorman finance is throwing into the exploitation of Bulgaria was given in the Frankfurter Zeitung (September 7).     German and Viennese banks are interesting themselves more and more in the future development of the Danube route which will be in German hands.     Companies to exploit the mining districts of Serbia now in Bulgarian occupation, as well as to develop Bulgarian agriculture, have been formed by German capitalists Bulgarians have to face the fact that the future offers little prospect but that of complete economic dependence on the Central
This is displeasing to Bulgarian public opinion for two reasons. In the first place, Bulgarian politicians have repeatedly said, and on this point their word may he taken, that Bulgaria wishes to be independent of all the great Powers.     There is no doubt that the stake for   which Bulgaria was fighting was a high one;    that is to say she hoped to make herself far and away the strongest power in the Balkans, and, as such, a State which, owing to its strength and geographical position, would be sought in alliance both by the Central Pov/ers and by Russia.     In view of the approaching disintegration which Bulgarians believe is overtaking Russia, they would now be inclined to substitute for Russia the Western Pov/ers, and especially Britain and America.     They wish to be left in a position where they will be able to play Britain against Germany and- vice versa and thereby strengthen their own importance.   They have no desire to become merely a commercial annexe of the Central Powers, and having achieved, by German military aid, their territorial aims they would be, and indeed are, quite willing as a whole to turn to the Entente Powers for help in the achievement of the rest of their programme.   Further, the Germans are, as ihey have always been, unpopular in Bulgaria.     The imperialism of the small Balkan State claches with the imperialism of its more powerful German Ally (see Report No. XVI), and the Bulgarian resents the way in which the German military authorities and German finance have assumed the direction of Bulgarian affairs.The Government and the Opposition.Obviously, if at this hour a rapprochement is to be made to the Entente Powers, Tsar Ferdinand and the Government politicians are not the suitable persons to make it.     V.&apos;e must distinguish bet-veen two political tendencies in Bulgaria.     In the first place there are the whole-hearted pro-Germans, - people like 2Ir Rizov
(Bulgarian Minister in Berlin), Mr Konchilov (Vice-president of the Chamber), and others, whose personal interests and sympathies are absolutely at one with those of Germany.     To these may be added more or less the supporters of the Government, who, though they may not be personally Germanophil, have made Germanophilism a chief plank in their political programme.   On the other hand, the Opposition leaders - men like Geshov, Halinov, even Danev, and the chiefs of the Broad Socialist Party - have been discreet in their professions of pr o-Germanism.       They have never opposed the German Alliance and, indeed, have worked whole-heartedly with the Central Powers and paid frequent visits to the Germanic capitals, but at the same time they have been careful to leave the door open for a reconciliation with enemy countries, at first, as they hoped, through the medium of Russia, and, since the Revolution, through the medium of America.It is difficult to say how far the Government and Opposition are working together in regard to foreign policy.     What is certain is that their territorial demands for Bulgaria are Identical. What is also certain is that Opposition journalists have been In the closest touch with the Radoslavov Government and with the German authorities, and, in return, supporters of Radoslavov have co-operated with Geshov&apos;s &quot;Alliance of Bulgarian Savants, ?;riters and Artists&quot;, the avowed aim of which was to get into touch with the Entente Powers.     But what is not certain is whether the change of Government In Bulgaria, which, according to all accounts, is likely to take place very soon, will be an honest expression of Opposition dislike to Radoslavov or will be an affair arranged with the   Government.       It may be that Radoslavov in his anxiety to ^ save the country, and therefore himself, from the punishment which must overtake her in the event of the Entente Powers1 complete
victory, would be willing on certain terms to allow himself to be defeated by the Opposition and to afford them the opportunity of securing what Bulgaria has gained in the war by winning the favour of the Entente Powers.     It may be that Radoslavov has not gone as far as this, but that, as the Bulgarian agents suggest^ Tsar Ferdinand himself may be contemplating a political coup of this character and may call to office some of the old Russophil Opposition parties in the hope of deceiving the Entente Powers. These points are not quite clear;   what is clear is that Bulgarian of all parties are agreed as to war aims and that the old personal spirit of political rivalry is as strong as it has always been in Bulgaria.Bulgarian War Aims.It has been repeatedly pointed out in these Reports, from Wo. I on, that there is no dissentient voice in Bulgaria (with, of course, the exception of the Narrow Socialists whose outlook is purely International and anti-national) as to the demand that all the territories at present occupied by Bulgarian troops should be secured to Bulgaria for ever.      Various instances of this demand have been quoted in many Reports;   two further recent expressions of it may be added.(1) An interview which afpears with a Bulgarian journalist in the Neue Zureher Zeitung (September 30) definitely declares:-(a) &quot;Bulgaria must be secured against Rumania by the possession of the whole of Bobrogea&quot;.(b) &quot;Experience has shown us that we cannot count for long on an entente with Serbia.     We must have ^direct connections with the great railway lines of Western Europe and that is why we must have a common frontier vrith Hungary&quot;.(c) &quot;No honest man can contest our rights to Macedonia.     We must keep Macedonia, v/ith the tovns of Kavalla, Serres and Dhrama    .... and Saloniki must be &apos; internationalised&quot;.
(&apos;(d) &quot;Respect for peace (in the Balkans) can only be assured by a State stronger than the others, able to hold its own against a coalition of all its neighbours.     We wish to be that State and to-day, in fact, we are&quot;.(2) An interview with Radoslavov is published by the Vossische Zeitung (October 4), in which he said with regard to Bulgarian war aims: -&quot;The world knows our aims;   especially the Entente knows them, for before our intervention in the war I repeatedly put them before its representatives.     In a word they are:     the union of all Bulgarian lands which we must strive for and obtain:   Macedonia,, as far as a line drawn south of Monastir, the Bulgarian Horava, and Dobrogea up to the mouth of the Danube&quot;.Radoslavov had the assurance to use the word &quot;desannexions&quot; with regard to these chauvinist claims.These aims are put forward in every statement of the Bulgarian case to our agents abroad, even though on such occasions Bulgarians might well be expected to employ the most moderate tone possible. Mr Sakyzov, for instance (the Broad Socialist leader), in a Stock-holm conversation was frank enough to state that he did not believe in the possibility of an actual, close-knit Balkan Federation. &quot;This could only come to pass&quot;, he said, &quot;in the event of a complete Entente victory, followed by the abolition of all the dynasties&quot; - even then he did not see how in practice it could be brought about.        This is not an isolated utterance of the Broad Socialist Party, but can be.confirmed by quotations from the Broad Socialist organ Narpd, which has always been absolutely frank in the expression of its view that the peace of the Balkans demands a Bulgarian hegemony.     This view is supported by all parties in Bulgaria and hr Radoslavov for once in his life speaks the truth cwhen he says in his interview with the Vossische Zeitung with reference to a possible change of Government in Bulgaria:    i;You
seem to be afraid that a change of Government might shatter the foundations of the Alliance.     This, too, I consider absolutely out of the question.   Certainly there are many amongst the Opposition parties who were formerly Russophil, but these people, if they came to the helm of the State, would neither be in the position nor even wish to apply politically their former political sympathies.   The Russian Revolution has had a sobering effect on their spirits, for Russia is at present far too problematical a figure to represent a serviceable ally&quot;.Will There Be a Revolution?Mr Radoslavov was anxious to dispel the correspondents idea that his Government x:/as likely to have to yield place to the Opposition parties;   Nevertheless there may be something in the persistent rumours that during this month or very shortly the Opposition parties, either, as we have seen, in collusion with Radoslavov himself or in opposition to both Tsar Ferdinand and his Prime Minister, may secure the control of the Government.     But it Is difficult to see how this change in Bulgaria would be of value to Entente policy in the Balkans.     Bulgarian chauvinistic demands so clash with the essential, racial and economic interests of Serbia, Greece and Rumania as to be quite irreconcilable with any programme of the Entente Powers for a just and permanent settlement of the Balkans.   Further, though as we have seen there Is a strong anti-German current in Bulgaria, this does not go the length of a desire for a complete breach with the Central Powers, and in fact even the Bulgarian Opposition end Socialists wish a common frontier with Hungary:    they merely wish to be In the agreeable position of being able to exploit at onco the alliance
t&apos;of the Central Powers and the friendship of the Entente Powers. They appeal to the economic and political interests of the Central powers through one set of agents and through the other attempt a rapprochement with this country and America on the basis of sentiment. In this latest move Geshov&apos;s party is naturally the most active. The connection of himself and his friends with the American Robert College in Constantinople and with certain British educational and industrial circles, especially in Manchester, provides a good medium for pursuing this propaganda.     Further, in America there Is a free field for activity.     The extraordinary statements of the Bulgarian Minister in Washington, Hr Panaretov, who belongs to the Geshov pro-American circle (he was, in fact, for over 20 years Professor of the Bulgarian Language at Robert College), that Bulgaria would have preferred to join the Allies, etc. (see The Times, September 28) - whether the statements were made with tho approval of Mr Radoslavov or without,it is connected with the same intrigue. The feverish activity of Bulgarian officials in Bulgarising or destroying the non-Bulgarian majorities in the occupied provinces are all carried on with a view to being able to point, when discussing matters with the Entente Powers, to the purely Bulgarian character of these provinces.None of these Opposition leaders, politicians or agents are, in fact, to be trusted.   They are neither Germanophil nor Ententophil in policy, whatever their sentiments are.   They are frankly in favour of a greater Eulgaria dictating the policy of their diminished and exhausted neighbours, and that policy will be based, they hope, on the situation in which Bulgarian friendship will be sought by both great groups of Powers in Europe.     A separate peace engineered by them in fact would not be a peace which separated Bulgaria from the Central Powers,&quot; but merely a peace which separated the Entente Powers from
their three Balkan Allies, leaving Bulgaria in the happy position of being able to dictate her own policy and to play one group of Powers against the other.    The one hope of Bulgaria adopting a more moderate attitude and one with which the Entente Powers might find it possible to agree would be the emergence and strengthening of the really democratic parties in Bulgaria - the Narrow Socialists tilth their anti-chauvinistic international views, and the Agrarian parties, which though unenlightened and without leaders, have been less led astray by the Imperialist instructions which dominate intriguing politicians in Bulgaria.   There is some reason to believe that recently these parties have strengthened their hold on a large portion of the Bulgarian democracy.   Any real change of heart in Bulgaria should therefore be measured not by the success of a political coup   on the part of Mr Geshov, I r Halinov or other politicians of their kind, but by the outspokenness and determination shown by these purely democratic parties.     Therefore, their activities in the opening of the Sabraniye will be well worth watching.19.10.17. - AVAL.
