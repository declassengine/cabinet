(This Document is the Property ef 32 His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government)7.Q0 ^ I-     V ^ FOOD PRODUCTION.(Memorandum by the Food Controller. )I have seen the memorandum on Food Production, dated 19th October, circulated by Lord Milner to the War Sabinet, In which he suggests &quot;that the President of the Board of Agriculture and the Food Controller should be asked to come and see the Cabinet at some very early date, to report personally on this matter, and to put before us any suggestions they may have for speeding up.&quot;I desire to say that the Food Controller has&apos; at present nothing to do with food production, which is a matter entirely within the scope of the Board of Agriculture and Food Production Department.I shall, however, be very glad to attend any meeting of the War Cabinet at which the question of Food Production is discussed.Proposals have been made for the transfer of the food preservation functions of the Food Production Department to the Ministry of Food, but at present the   matter is net within the province of the latter Department.RHONDDA.22nd October, 1917.
