n7,^.1   i j (This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic fVfajesty&apos;s Government.).....Proposed Transfer of the Organisation for purchase of frozen Meat an! Colonial Cheese to the Food Controller.-------0O0-------------The Board of Trade offer no objection to the transfer of their functions In connection with the purchase ofthese commodities to the Food Controller if this be thoughtdesirable.   The meat is fcou^it mainly from the Plate andAustralasia under contracts and agreements lasting till 3months after the end of the war, and is chiefly for consump-tion by the Allied Armies, the Board of Trade having enteredinto formal Agreements with the French and Italian Governmentsfor their supplies.The transfer of functions will naturally carry with itthe transfer of the Board of Trade organisation for the pur-chase of meat, i.e. the special emergency organisation setup for ifais purpose under Sir.Thomas Robinson.   I should,however, mention that certain members of the permanent Boardof Trade staff have a3so been engaged in the ordinary courseof their duties in supervising the operations of the meatpurchasing organisation.   These officers will of course beready to give the Food Controller the benefit of their ez-perience if he wishes to oonsult them, but I could not possiblytransfer thorn to the Ministry of Food, as I need them veryurgently for other and important work.A. H. STAHEEY.22nd October, 1917.
