REPORT relating to the War Work of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland for the week ending 17th October, 1917.I. Food Production.Agricultural Work.So great improvement has taken plaoe in the weather conditions and the result is that considerable quantities of grain are still standing in many fields in the later districts.   The advent of colder weather has, however, prevented further sprouting.Satisfactory reports are being received from all parts of the oountry regarding the quality and bulk of the potato crop.1. Compulsory Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulation 2 M.The Board have iesued an Order under Section (l) (f) of this Regulation authorising the proprietor to terminate the tenancy of the farms of Muirfoot and Craigend in Lanarkshire.2. Labour : Soldiers.The more effioient soldiers who were employed during the late harvest are at present being selected for retention on the land for the 1318 cultivation scheme, but the Board continue to reoeive urgent requests for the release of skilled ploughmen from the Array.3. School, fojr ffptor Tractor Prayers *A number of the men hare completed their training at the Board1s Traotor Driving Sohool and they have now taken up employment on farms.4* Agricultural Traotor and Plough Demonstration-At the request of the Board the Highland and Agricultural Society have organised a series of demonstrations at various centres for testing the efficiency of agricultural tractors and ploughs.   The oentree seleoted are Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth and eaoh demonstra-, tion will last two days.   With the approval of the Secretary for Scotland the Board have made a provision of  350 from their funds in aid of the scheme.The first of the eeriee of exhibitions has commenced at Dalmeny, Edinburgh and about 40 tractors and ploughs have so far taken part in the demonstration.   It is evident from the first day*s trial of stubble ploughing that many of the tractors and ploughs now manu-factured are able to do satisfactory work under ordinary conditions.5. The Restoration of Meal Mills.The Board have recently had under consideration the general question of giving aid towards the restoration of meal mills which have fallen eut of use in remote districts of Scotland.   They oon-sider that euoh work forms an essential part of their programme of increased production and they have accordingly decided, with the approval of the Secretary for Sootland, to give assistance in a limited number of oases where they are satisfied that there is a strong local demand for a  mill whioh, if put in working order, would be made available for all growers of oats in the district, not only during the War but also in future years.   The Board have earmarked a sum of  3000 from their funds sufficient to cover the cost of renova-tion in 10 or 12 oases and they propose to give the necessary assist-ance by way of loan.

The proprietor of the farm is in sympathy with the scheme, and all the conditions of assistance laid down by the Board have been accepted by him and also by the Associa-tion.   Ex-soldiers will be given a course of training extending over 12 months or such period as may be found most suitable in order to fit them for situations on the land or for the occupation of small holdings, and during the period of instruction the Association pro-pose to give the men free board and lodging and a small wage.
