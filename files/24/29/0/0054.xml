ftis Document is the property of His Britannic Uajesty&apos;s Government).0 R E T .j.T.2354.WARCABINET.CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.(Memorandum by Lord Milner).I feel bound to place on record my dissent from the recommendations of the Committee on Conscientious Objectors. My colleagues are already aware of my attitude on this question, and I do not propose to recapitulate here the arguments which I have advanced in previous papers.     The two main reasons, however, for rejecting Mr. Asquith^s suggestion for dealing with the &quot;Absolutists&quot;, which are advanced in the paper just circulated (G.T.2321), appear to me to be far from conclusive.1.     I demur to the statement that the &quot;Absolutists&quot; are being imprisoned, not as conscientious objectors but &quot;as passive resisters to the Military Service Acts&quot;.     It would seem a misnomer to call a&apos; man a &quot;passive resistor&quot; to an Act, when his whole case is that a particular provision of the Act in question was intended to be, and therefore should be, applied to him.     If, on the other hand, it is meant that these men are organising or, were they released, would organise a campaign of passive resistance to the Act, I should regard that as an argument for proceeding against them with all the rigour of the law under the Statute dealing with that offence.      But I fail to see that it constitutes any justification for withholding from them the exemption which Parliament must have intended them to have, if it meant anything, when it provided for the possibility of absolute exemption.2.     The second argument is to the effect that any action on the lines of Mr. Asquith!s suggestion would involve legislation.     I have never advocated legislation, and I cannot now see that it is necessary.     I still believe that it would be found possible to deal with the question administratively, and I regret that the Committee have not been able to offer any suggestions under this head.In conclusion I should like to re-assert my conviction that we have not heard the last of this question.     To my mind the essential vice ox our present policy consists in the fact that we have singled out for severest treatment the very class of conscientious objector to whom we could most afford to be lenient, whereas the men whose cases are more doubtful are being treated with comparative indulgence.     I cannot but believe that this policy will be found increasingly difficult to defend against public criticism in Parliament and elsewhere..(Intd.)   M.
