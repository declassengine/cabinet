./9 n280tsmatmic Majesty^ Gove.-AIR BOARD.Re-oort to the Cabinet.&apos;,B.153/38.20th October, 1917,1,   The Board have ha&amp;underconsideration during this week the programme of development of squadrons during the next 9 months., having regard &quot;to the engines likely to be available.   This has to be calculated upon an assumed rate of wastage for aeroplanes and engines, and as regards service squadrons with the Expeditionary Force this is taken as 50^ per month for aeroplanes and 7$ per month for engines,   Theso are extreme figures taken as a measure of safety, and are in the case of aeroplanes some 25^ and in the case of engines nearly 50$, in excess of those established by past experience* As regards bombing squadmns, however? of which it is hoped to establish a large number in the course of next year, we have little experience to guide us.   It is certain, however, that the wastage will be less than in the case of fighting and artillery machines and a wastage rate of 25fo for long distance bombers has provisionally been adopted*   On this basis there is ground for expecting that by July 1st of next year as i-mny as 17 squadrons cf Eandioy Fago heavy bombers and 45 squadrons of light day bombers should be available *   Tho precise number of additional squadrons of other typos which will have been provided by that date cannot at preecrt bo determined, as certain details are still under discussion,,2i     The Civil Aerialto tho.Board a proposaltoTransport establishCommittee ahave submitted seaplane mail service between Aberdeen and Bergen,   The Board ha*e replied that in view of the impossibility of sparing the seaplanes and skilled pilots which would be required for the purpose the proposal cannot at present be entertained. &apos; &apos;ripply.3.     It has been decided that three members of the Board shall visit Turin at the end of the month to see the Caproni and Fiat works and deal with certain questions of supply, particularly&quot;as regards Fiat engines in which the Board has a strong interests4.
