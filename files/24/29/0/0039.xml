Colonel JonasTMMI IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMIC MAJESTY*S QGmmSBSS)WAR     CABINETPROPOSED SUMMARY OF WAR WORK, 1916-1917Some time ago the War Cabinet discussed the idea of pre-senting to Parliament and the public a carefully compiled record of the war activities and accomplishments of the period since the present Government assumed office in December 1916,   It was thought that a very widespread ignorance prevails of the astonishing effort which had been put forth by the nation at home and by the Army and Havy outside .these shores, in the prosecution of the war, and that Buch a record might be of immediate service in the effect that it would have both upon censorious politicians and an anxious public, as well as of permanent value, as an authorative contribution to the future history of the war.At the instance of the Prime Minister I have discussed the matter with Sir Maurice Hankey and Professor Adams.   We are in general agreement as to the best method of treatment, and we shall be grateful for the sanction of the Cabinet before an attempt is made to put it into execution.An examination of the case led to the preliminary con-elusions that if such a reoord be compiled, it should not be done in a hasty or imperfect fashion, nor should it be an ephemeral device merely to advertise the Government or stimulate the spirits of their supporters. Something more than high-class Journalism appears to be required.   The document should contain facts a^d figures of unimpeachable authority and scientific value; the parts of it which challenge the public verdict both of our own and of other countries, should be in the nature of a State paper of the first im-portance written with becoming weight and dignity; the whole.J559
should &quot;be presented in a form capable of translation and wide diffusion in many lands.   Its publication should be timed for an appropriate and. easily intelligible date, such as the end of the first year of office of the present administration (i.e the beginning of December).,   its issue at a moment when the Session will have run two-thirds of its course arid the Government may conceivably be in troubled waters\ is more likely to be effective than would be a premature appearance now.I made the suggestion, to.- the Cabinet that the synopsis should take the form of a Report by the War Cabinet to Parliament.,   It might be entitled &quot;Report of a Year&apos;s War Work Presented by the War Cabinet to both Houses of Parliament.&quot; It might be signed by the entire War Cabinet or by the Prime Minister on their behalf.    I recall the zest with which Lord Cromer&apos;8 Annual Reports on Egyptian Administration, admirably written and not too iong, were received by the Press and Parliament twenty years ago.   Moreover, would not the sub-mission of such a Repxt to Parliament bo regarded by the latter as a high compliment, emphasizing their relationship of ultimate superiority to the Cabinet, just as a Board of Directors is responsible to the shareholders by whom it is appointed?I submit to the Cabinet the following sketch of a possible arrangement..   The Report might be divided into three parts.1.   A General Introduction, or Summary covering not more than eight to ten pages of print in a Parliamentary White Book.   This would be the most important document of all; it should be sufficiently long to summarise the argument and lightly cover the entire ground, but sufficiently short to -be published in extenao. in every newspaper.   To it should be appended the names of the Cabinet or its Chief.   It would be. a(2)condensed -
condensed statement of the British, eiTcrt-during--the past year, fqr the^on^umption^^ the British public, the Alliednations, neutral countries and the world at large.11.     Then should follow the narrative of effort and achievement&apos;, dealt with under different heads.    The classifi-cation should be one of general subject matter rather than of departmental organisation; fox the latter would have the familiar and suspicions appeararce of self-vindication by departments; anxious to extol their own performance.   Por instance, transport would be dealt with as a whole instead of being split up under separate departmental headings.   I suggest the following as a rough epitome of the subjects to be dealt with in this section :-I     CONSTITUTIONAL - OR ADMINISTRATIVE. BKyBLQPJpSNT-(a) Conception, creation and growth of the War Cabinet; number of Meetings.(b) Meetings of Imperial War Cabinet.(c) Meetings of Imperial War Conference.(d) Creation of Ministries, and other organisations at home, Work by neaus of Committees presided over where possible by Cabinet Ministers.,II.  inj:;s.r^(a) Increased frequency &quot;of Inter-Ally Conferences andconsultantcna -..... military, naval and generalboch in Europe and America.     The effect of these Conferences on foreign relations, particularly in regard to the reply to President Wilson&apos;S Peace Note, Greece (Jonnart&apos;s Mission).lb) British action towards Russia.    The equipment of Russia regarded as essential to.the military plan3 of 1917. Lord Milner&apos;s Mission.    The Revolution.   Mr. Henderson&apos;s Mission.,   Other efforts to obtain contact and understanding with the new Government.(c) Intervention of the United States of America, Mr. Balfour&apos;s Mission.(d) The principles on which o\:t foreign policy has been conducted.(e) International situation now compared with December 1916.   List of countries which have joined Alliance or severed relations with enemy.III.   BL0GKAD3,
IV. DOMINION AND INDIAN CONTRIBUTIONS.V. THE NAVY(Ending with a brief; recapitulation of the measures   food production, forestry, ship-building, i.e. - taken to safeguard us /  against the submarine menace; these meas-ures will be described in detail in their proper places in the Report.)vi.      IM^MM.(a)   Growth, organisation, recruiting, equipment.,   (b)   Warj achievement,    The war maps of Dec. 1916 and Dec. 1917 in France and Flanders, Salonica (?) Egypt and Palestine, East Africa, Mesopotamia.VII. THE AIR   (unless this be included under the sectionsdealing with Army and Navy)VIII. MUgDPIONS^IX.       TRANSPORT -   ShipbuildingShipping concentration: Docks and Railways.x-       RESTRICTION ,QF IMPORTS,XI . .     EOpDPRpptJCTtONj DISTRIBUTION &amp; PRICES: DEVELOPMENT OF HOME GROWE&apos; TIMBER: COAL &quot;CONTROL .XII.      LABOUR. -   Man-PowerWages: Conciliation^ welfare: Pensions.XIII.       LEGISLATION.XIV.       FINANCE..The material under all these headings would of course be supplied by the Departments concerned.   But they would be co-ordinated and put into final shape in the Secretariat at Downing Street.   While Part I   would be intended for immediate world-wide consumption, Part II would constitute the real record and vindication of the Government during the past year and would be the mine in which the politican, the speech-maker, and the student would dig.   Part III. might consist of figures,  cal-culations and tables illustrating or supporting the con-clusions arrived at in I.     They would be invaluable for the
statistician and historian of the future.I dare say that closer examination will reveal many flaws or omissions in this sketch.   But I submit it as a tentative framework which can be given shape and substance by those to whom the task of compilation, itself a very honourable and important one, is entrusted.(initialled) C, OF K.&apos;r-\r19th October, 1917.
