Telegrams-;-&quot;SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDON.&quot;MINISTRY OF SHIPPING16th October, 1917Sir,In continuation- of my letter of the 6th instant, Iam directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows 1.     CONVOYS-(a)   Homeward bound Convoys.   Since the last report, 6 convoys consisting of 105 ships (793,900 tons deadweight) have been brought in, and there are now 16 convoys consisting of 244 ships on passage home.   Since the date of the last report, there have been 4 casualties due to enemy action. The s.s. &quot;LUGANO&quot; was mined and the s.s. &quot;HURST&quot; was torpedoed, out of H.M.S, &quot;DRAKE&quot; convoy) and H.M,Si ^DRAKE&quot; was also torpedoed.     Out of H.M.S, &quot;ANTRIM&quot; convoy, the sis. &quot;MEMLING&quot; was torpedoed S? ter she had been handed over by her British escort from Brest,   Out of H.M.S. &quot;MARSHFORT&quot; convoy, the sss, &quot;FOREST MOOR&quot; was torpedoed about 150 mi3e s West of Gibraltar. There was one casualty due to marine peril;   the s.s. &quot;MENDIP RANGE&quot; collided with H.M.S. &quot;DRAKE&quot; and was beached.   The s,s. &quot;KANSAS CITY&quot;, referred to in my last report, has not arrived and no news has been heard of her.   It is feared that she must be considered as lost, presumably in the bad weather when she parted company with the convoy.10 convoys, consisting of 135 ships (903,500 tons deadweight) were escorted through the danger zone, and there are now in the(b)   Outward bound Convoys.   Since the last reportbe Secretary, War Cabinet.danger

REQUISITIONING OFNEUTRAL STEAMERS.During the last week the following Swedish steamers have been requisitioned, namely, the s.s. &quot;BELLGROVE&quot;, &quot;CREMONA&quot;, &quot;PHYLLIS&quot; and &quot;SPHYNX&quot;; also two Norwegian, the s.s, &quot;NORV0&quot; and &quot;RAGLI&quot;,4,    STANDARD SHIPS,The s,si &quot;WAR THISTLE&quot;, the first Standard ship built on the Clyde, was finally delivered on the $th instant. 5*    IMPORTS OF PHOSPHATE ROCK.The question o$ the importation of phosphate rock has engaged the attention of the War Cabinet (see G.T. 2226) and has formed the subject of correspondence with Lord Milner.   The position in regard to the importation of phosphate rock is as follows:-Transports
Transports stemmed- -sines- -1st July under- the- J^inlstry-of Shipping scheme ... 96,460 tonsOf this Was sunk   . 5,695   &quot;and there were loading or to load 19,100   ,!In liners or transports from UnitedStates, there were loaded or to load 12,500   &quot;The quantity loaded by private merchants is not known In this Department but isestimated to be about ... 15,000   nDuring August last the labour troubles in North Spain and at home seriously reduced the supplies of hematite ore and it was necessary in consequence to load an additional quantity from North Africa.   This involved drawing on the Mediterranean tonnage to a greater extent for iron ore, and also, to some extent, reduced the facilities for shipping phosphate from Tunis, since iron ore and phosphate could not be loaded concurrently on the necessary scale at La Goulette.   Special efforts are being made to ship the full monthly qUota of 50,000 tons, in accordance with the instructions of the War Cabinet, this month, and from this time onwards *I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) John Anderson.
