Ooverjiment)210CONFIDENTIAL. -sSS^        MINISTRY 0  PENSIONS, ^sSSort for period from 13th October to 19th October, 1917*Pensions.Number ,^f Pensions.   The number      pensions granted during the week tc afficers and men, and to widows, children and dependants (Appendix I) was 15,847 (exceeding the highest number yet recorded by *ver 1,500) against 14,296 last week and 12,797 the week before.   Since the beginning cf the war 892,718 pensions, including children&apos;s allowances, have been awarded.Appendix II shows that last week 35 grants of supple-mentary pensions and special allowances were made by the Special Grants Committee against 38 in the previous week.   The total number to date including grants by the Statutory Committee is 4,613.Pensions to Soldiers.   The number of fresh claims to pension; of disabled soldiers dealt with by the Awards to Soldiers Branch during the week ending 19th October was 8,000 as compared with 7,000 during the previous week, and 6,200 during the week before.Of the 8,000 cases 4,842 were disposed of by the award of pension, permanent or temporary, and 3,142 by the grant of gratuities, and in 16 cases the claims were rejected.   Claims which had previously been rejected under former ?/arrants were admitted in 920 cases, 885      the men being granted gratuities and 35 pensions.   The total number of claims previously rejected which have been dealt with up to date is 11,767 of which 1,188 have been met by the award of pension and 10,579 by gratuities.Pensions to v/idows and Dependants.    The work of awarding and authorising, payment of Widows and Dependants pensions in current cases is completely up to date.
1634 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 2,748 last week and 2,577 the week before, the falling off being due tc the difficulty of obtaining certain necessary documents from Paymasters.   There remain 3,302 cases to be dealt with and it is hoped to dispose of these by the 31st October.   Appendix III.   The 1,634 cases this week include 77 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 4/lld a week, and 1,070 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the Old Warrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate ef 8/2d a week.   The rest of the 1,634 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to pre-war dependance..As a result of the week&apos;s re*examinations as to entitlement under the New Warrant 1 widow not previously helped has been admitted to full pension, and 2 to temporary pension. 8 (widows and dependants) remain to be dealt with out of the original total of 4,722. (Appendix IV).Pensions to Parents.   New Scheme.   1,746 Parents1 pensions of less than 3/6d have been increased during the week to that amount with effect from 1st September, 1917,   The average rate of increase is l/- a week.   The tota.1 number.30f increases to 3/6d a week is now 3,931.Separation allowances, &amp;o., - Rate-aided. Institutions. Appendix V contains a report of the proceedings and a summary of the finding of a Joint conference held upon an instruction of the War Cabinet to consider the question of the payment of separation allowances during any period when a soldier&apos;s or sailor&apos;s wife or dependant was being maintained in a rate-aided institution.   The opportunity was taken to consider the administration of widows1 and dependants&apos; pensions in similar circumstances,Substantially
Substantially tha conference decided to recommend that the separation allowance to a wife whilst she was in such an institution should be suspended as at present but that the local Committee should be authorised to issue for the benefit of the family an allowance at the same rate as the separation allowance for the purpose of the upkeep of the home, any balance being handed to the wife on her discharge from the Institution.    It would be open tc the Poor Law Authorities to recover from that balance a reasonable sun in respect of their: expenditure.In the case of children it was recommended that the rate of separation allowance to the mother should not be altered and ithat it should be left to the Poor Law authorities to arrange with her for re-imfeursement.In the case of other dependants a similar course was recommended.As to pensions it was recommended that the provisions of the Royal Warrant of 1914 empowering the Ministry to agree with Guardians for repayment out of the pension cf the amount of relief should be amended so as to provide that a widowrs pension should be suspended but that it should be administered by the Icoal Committee for her benefit.Pensions Appeal Tribunal.    1C82 Appeal Forms had been received by the 17th October, an increase of 144 sir.au the 10th October, these numbers not including 234 appeals (143 during the week) referred to Local Committees.   Appendix VI shows that 529 cases have been disposed of and 110 are ready to be heard. Retired Pay of Army Officers, &amp;-,c,,   The following is a summary of the progress made in the review of cases under the Officers T/arrant of the 1st August, 1917.Officers.   Retired pay has been re-examined in 628 ca of which 496 have received increased rates, the average increasbeing
being  31 a year.   About 722 remain to be re-examined, 25 Officers &quot;slightly impaired&quot; have been placed on retired pay in lieu of gratuities previously granted and 6 have had their gratuities increased by an average amount of  43.   44 gratuities in non-attributable cases have been increased, the average increase being  47.   8 gratuities of an average amount of  38 have been awarded where no previous grant was admissible.Nurses.   51 have had their pensions increased, the average increase being  51.   4 have received increased gratuities the average increase being  33.Widows and Children.

The rules submitted to the Treasury have now been generally approved by them, and it is hoped that progress with these cases will soon be made. Retired Pay of Navy Officers. Under the Order in Council of 29th September, 1917, 47 Naval Officers cases have been re-examined of which 44 have received increased retired pay, the average increase being  28.   About 193 remain tc be examined.One gratuity of  70 has fceen awarded where no previous grant was admissible.
TREATMENT.9V Medical Referees.   The Committee of Selection held two further meetings on Wednesday and Friday the 17th and 19th instant, and agreed in recommending some 40 doctors for appointment to the post of Medical Referees in Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and the City cf Birmingham.   The areas most suitable for the convenience of the discharged disabled man have been selected with the assistance of the advice of the Local Committee in each case. 10* Hospital Treatment. Difficulty has been experienced in certain areas by Local Committees in making arrangements with the hospitals for the treatment of discharged men.   These difficulties have been occasioned mainly by a claim on the part of certain sections of the medical profession at the instance of the British Medical Association, that doctors giving their services in hospitals should receive direct remuneration for their services end partly because cf the increased cost of food and drugs, which have raised the general cost of the maintenance of a patient beyond the normal figure.   The British Hospitals Association, which represents the Committees of Management of the great majority of the provincial hospitals and a few cf the London ones, held a meeting on the 19th instant to consider the two questions of,(a) The cost of the treatment of the serving soldier, and(b) Th&amp; cost of the treatment of the discharged soldier. With regard to ,the latter point, which alone concerns the Ministry, a resolution was put to the meeting and carried, to the effect that the charges provided for by the Ministry in their Instructions were in many cases too low, and that such charges should provide for some remuneration for doctors giving attendance.   The sense of the meeting, was definitely opposedto separate remuneration to the doctors as distinct from thecharges
charges made oy the hospital or. the groundx that the doctors&apos;were officers of the hospital--   It seems clear-howler-thathospital Committees are prepared generally to recognise that-medica^attendant at the hospital have a claim to someremuneration&apos;in the case of patients for which public bodiesare responsible, and the solution referred to in the lastweekly report as having been adopted by some hospitals namelythe allocation to the doctors of a percentage of the paymentsmade to the hospital by the Ministry or other Department ofBody found general favour.   Under this plan it is understoodthat the percentage referred t6 would go to a common fund whichwould be distributed by the hospital staff among themselvesand would thus practically go to the junior staff and not tothe outside consultants and surgeons, who would prefer to contcontinue to give their services free.   Mr.Hore, who attendedthe Meeting on behalf of the Ministry explained that the rateof charges laid down as a normal rate in the instructions hadbeen arrived at after consultation with other Public Depart-ments and Local Bodies who had been accustomed to pay forhospital patients.   As regards the complaint that such chargeswere inadequate to cover the cost of treatment, it was statedon behalf of the Ministry that the Minister had no intentionthat the treatment of any discharged disabled man should beundertaken at a loss to a hospital and it was pointed, out thatthe Instructions provided for the payment of a higher ratewhere the circumstances ouuld be shown to justify it, and thathigher payment was, in fact made in cases of Paraplegics,whose treatment was more expensive.   On the other hand, anyproposal to extend the ordinary charge for.maintenance so as tocover items which had not previously been included in thepubliccharge made by other/bodies, would have to be considered as a &apos; question affecting far more than the Ministry of Pensions alone more especially in view cf the fact that the need for hospital treatment for discharged disabled men, was only a comparatively temporary one, and with the termination ofhostilities,
hostilities,.jiius^-j*apldly diminish...     The steps to be taken -to give effect to the Resolution passed by the Association were delegated to a Committee who proposed to approach the C       several Departments concerned.11,   Casss of Hardship among Discharged Disabled Men.   Representations have been received from a number of Local Committees to the effect that there are a certain number of cases in which, from one circumstances or another, hardship is occasioned to thedischarged man which cannot adequately bo met under the    : existing Regulations and Instructions of the Ministry. Appendix VII contains a letter &quot;which has been addressed to the Representatives of the Ministry in the provinces asking for their views as to the cases in question, and the manner in which they could best be dealt with.    It is proposed tp hold a Conference of the Representatives at an early date to consider the whole matter.12.   Appendix VIII contains a report of the twentyfifth meeting of the Joint Committee for Institutional Treatment.    The report deals among other matters with the provision of (a) pavilions for the treatment of advanced tuberculosis and the probable ijeed for an extension of this provision and (b) aftercare colonies with provision for training in workshops.   The Committee recommended that steps should at once be taken to Initiate experiments in the latter direction.13.   Appendix IX contains a report of the general schemes of treat-ment submitted and sanctioned during the week.14.    Individual Cases of Treatment/The great bulk of cases oftreatment are under general schemes which have received approval but a small number of cases requiring special treatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has not previously been given are submitted each week.   During the week ended 17th October, 121 such cases   were so sanctioned..
15*. JStaribertvjmd^ Appendix X shows the number of menfor whom treatment has been, jprovidexi.ninde:r^a^ made- -or approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are payable.   It will be seen that 417 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended 17th October and that 1885 men were under treatment on that date, as.compared with 1552 men at the end of the previous week.The Table shows also the nature of the disablements for which treatment was required, and it will be seen that about two fifth of the cases are of wounds or injuries, rather more than 6 per cent being cases of paraplegia.   97 cases of neurasthenia were under treatment at Golders Green and 28 of, advanced tuberculosis in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in London.The number of discharged men in Lunatic asylums who have been admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was, on the 17th instant, 574.   Of these 26 had been admitted during the week.TRAINING.16. Tra.de Advisory Committees. Appendix XI contains a report of the meetings of the Boot and Shoe, and certain other Trade Advisory Committees during the week ended the 17th instant.Further instructions as to the conditions *f training in the- Jewellery trade and in Dental Mechanics are now under consideration and should be ready for issue at an early date.17. Schemes of training. Appendix XII contains a report of various general schemes of training submitted and sanctioned during the week ended the 17th instant.18. Individual cases of Training. Owing to the comparative ease with ?rhich employment is obtained now, the number of men offering themselves for training is, in the area of any single Local Committee, usually limited and are frequently not enough to call for general schemes of training.   In consequencea
a large proportion of the men who are admitted to training are the subject of individual application and sanction by the Minister&apos;   During the week ended 17th October 65 cases of training were thus sanctioned.   Of these 17 men were to be trainftE in the trades connected with engineering, 9 in motor mechanics and 6 as Cinema operatives.Number of Men under Training.   Appendix XIII shows that 77 men were admitted to training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week was 534.   Rather less than two-thirds of the number were under training in Technical Institutes. Training of widows    Appendix XIV contains the Instructions for the training of widows last referred to in Report No.XXXVIII as finally approved and issued to Local Committees.   In 17 cases training has been sanctioned during the past three weeks.O^GAr^ZATIOJT.Permanent Committee of the Inter-Allied Conference. In last week&apos;s report reference was made to the meeting in London of the Permanent Committee of the Inter-Allied Conference on the after-care df disabled soldiers.   At its first meeting the Committee approved tho addition of the new members appointed by the various Dominions, decided that each of the Allied Nations should appoint a correspondent to notify matters of interest to the Headquarters in Paris and, after discussingquestions relating to the establisment of a central laboratoryin the interests of disabled researcn Institute, decided that it would be besty men&quot;if&apos; or orAllied nation took its own action as to laboratories and experimental institutions and placed the results of investiga-tion at the disposal of the central Committee.   At its second meeting the Committee decided that the next meeting of the Inter-Allied Conference should take place in London at the end of May.   The question of finance in connection with the cost of the Permanent Committee in Paris was considered and the repre-sentatives of France, the United kingdom, the &apos;Jnited States and Russia ihtlinatsd that ,t^c-rfc was every reason to believe thattheir
their respective Governments would each contribute the. sum of 30,000 francs per annum towards the estimated requirement of 150,000.   The other delegates, including those of the Dominions, agreed to approach their Governments with a view to taking their share in the expense.   A copy of the report is attached and forms Appendix XV. 2,Reports of Inspectors. Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for the week ending 17th October are contained in Appendix XVI.The work of the Swinton (Lancashire) Local Committee is increased by the difficulty of getting replies from the Pay Office and by men, sent home pending discharge, having to live on their wives1 separation allowances.   An extract of the report is being sent to the War Office.   In the East Midlands the able organisation of the Nottinghamshire Committee is reflected in its sub-committees and the cases before these Committees are dealt with not only efficiently but with consideration and sympathy,   The Buxton sub-committee, whose staff is all voluntary, is also well spoken of.    In Carmar-thenshire the system adopted in paying allowances makes it difficult to detect irregularities.   The Inspector for the South Midlands contrasts those Committees whose Secretaries are paid with those whose Secretaries are unpaid.    The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Local Committees, with unpaid secretaries, apart from the lack of organization, do not appear to have got a proper grip of their work, whilst at Watford, also with an unpaid Secretary, the visiting orgr.nis;:.tioiiiias broken down.   On the other hand Huntingdonshire, Bedford Borough and Luton with paid Secretaries are performing their work most capably. *   Visits by the Minister.   The Minister visited Birmingham on the 15th instant and met representatives of the Local Committees for that and adjoining districts and discussed with them their difficulties.   The Minister subsequently opened a hostelprovided
j^rtibecLiJr-th^ JE^airtri^ Club zX. Edgbas-toiv for-the accommodation of 50 men.New Local Committees.    In the Reports for the periods 4th to 10th August and 11th to 17th August roforcnoos wore made to applications for separate local Committees under Section 3 of the Naval and Military War Pensions &amp;c, (Administrative Expenses) Act, 1917.   Since theiithe Minister of Pensions has granted applications in the case of the Boroughs of Llanelly, Worthing, Guildford and Richmond and of the Urban Districts of Abersychan, Abertillery, Bedwelty, Ebb\a &apos; Vale and Tredegar. in Monmouthshire.    In 5 cases the application has been refused, viz., those relating to the Boroughs of Maidstone and Newcastle-under-Lyne and the Urbanv Districts of Erith, Gosport and Alverstoke and Gainsborough.   In 4 cases, viz., those relating to the Boroughs of Chatham and Taunton and *&apos; to        the Urban Districts of Beckenham and Long Eaton the application has been withdrawn.   The scheme for Llanelly has been approved and a draft scheme for Tunbridge \7ells has been provisionally approved. , Representation of Discharged Disabled men on Local Committees. In a circular of the 12th July last the Statutory Committee directed the attention of Local Committees to a statement of the Minister of Pensions that he looked upon it as of importance that Local Committees should be acquainted with the views of disabled discharged men in matters affecting their interests and suggested that Local Committees should consider the desirability of including such men in their Disablement Committees.   The Minister now deems it advisable that further steps should be taken in this direction and that statutory provision should be made for the inclusion in the Local Committee itself of at least one representative of disabled men who have been discharged from the military or naval service and with that object the Naval and Military War Pensions &amp;c, (Local Committees) Bill has been prepared and was introduced on the 17th instant.    It forms Appendix XVII.
06*. Conference at War Office,   A memorandum (Appendix XVIII) is , annexed of a conference held at the War Office on Thursday the 18th instant for the consideration of War Office proposals to shift to the Ministry of Pensions the present responsibilities of the War Office for the treatment of men who will not revert to military duty and for handing over to the Ministry the examination of discharged men for the re-assessment of their pensions.   A proposal was also made that the War Office should withdraw the present facilities they give for the re-admission of pensioners tc military hospitals.    The Minister of Pensions brought up the question cf a War Department Site for the extended accommodation of his Chelsea staff and that of the grave situation resulting from defective arrangements producing a hiatus&apos; between the issues of pay and of pension on a man&apos;s first discharge.Staff etc ,27 * Numbers of Staff.

i.&apos;.   APPENDIX V &apos;     .   227Administration of Separation Allowance and Pension during temporary residence in a rate-aided Institution.1.        An instruction having been received by the Ministry from the  .&apos;ar Cabinet to consider the question of the payment of Separation Allowances during any period when a soldier^ or sailerrs wife or dependant was being maintained during sickness in a rate-aided institution, conferences were held at the Ministry on the 21st September and the 4th October at which representatives of the Treasury, the Admiralty, the War Office, the Local Government Board and the Pensions iiinistry were present.It nas deemed advisable that the administration wf pension to the widow or dependants of deceased sailors or soldiers in similar circumstances should be considered at the same time, in order that if practicable the same procedure should be adopted.A.   Separation Allowance, 2. Three aspects of the question were discussed bythe Conference(a) The extent to which the demand upon the accommodation of the civil hospitals in consequence of the requirements of the Army (and of discharged disabled men) has reduced the accommodation available for women, who are in consequence obliged to have recourse to poor law infirmsuFies.(b) The propriety of the stoppage of separation allow-ances during stay in a rate-aided institution.(c) The right (if any) of the Guardians to be repaid the cost of maintenance out of the allowances otherwise due. 3*           There did not appear to be any evidence *f adeficiency
deficiency of accommodation for ;:omen requiring in-patienttreatment.   The poor lav/ infirmaries, particularly -/here,as in most of the large towns, there were separate institu-tions, are commonly resorted to by :/omen needing institu-tional treatment and do not seem to be regarded as &quot;pauper&quot;institutions in the same sense as the ./orkhouse.4.        As regards the propriety of the stoppage ofSeparation   Allowance it was stated on behalf of the WarOffice and Admiralty that the present agitation, so far asit was set in motion, by the poor law authorities, wasbased upon the wilful ignoring of the facts of the presentarrangements.   These are that, on the entrance of asailor&apos;s or soldier&apos;s wife into a rate-aided institution,while the issue of Separation Allowance in respect of her stops,the issue of the soldier&apos;s allotment continues, the rate ofthe allowance in respect of the children (if any) isincreased, and the Local Committee (established under theNaval and Lilitary War Pensions etc., Acts, 1915-1917)are authorised to supplement up to the amount of separationallowance previously issuable any deficiency of incomethere may be for the purpose of (1) &quot;keeping the home oing&quot; i.e., paying out insurance premiums, hire-purchasepayments and other contractual obligations, (2) providingfor the care of any children, and (3) providing the motherwith a sum not exceeding 1/5 weekly to meet incidentalexpenses while she is in.the institution (Instruction of the!.;ar Pensions etc., Statutory Committee, 27th Larch 1917).According to the experience of the ./ar Office and the Admiralty these arrangements generally speaking worked well.The
The V&apos;ar Office moreover contended that any arrangement by which the Poor Lai; Authorities would intervene in the home-maintenance would be directly against public opinion, that the local pensions committee .;ere the body expressly charged by Parliament with such maintenance and that it was in the interests of the soldier&apos;s wife that that Committee and not the Guardians should undertake this charge.5. As against these reasons for retaining the presentpractice it was urged that the separation allowance :ias in fact a part of the sailor fs or soldier&apos;s wages; that the Guardians had a right in any case to recover the cost of relief given by them to any person and that to cut off the separation allowance metfely reduced the ability of the person to refund the cost of relief and shifted the burden of maln-tenance on the Local rates.6. In the subsequent discussion Wo principal classesOf case were distinguished.^   Children.    In these cases under the present system there is a great deal of ..ork In the alteration of the rates of allowance, which leads to no very good result. The &apos;! ar Office and the Admiralty are willing that when a sailors or soldierfs child enters a rate-aided institution the rate of separation allowance issued to the mother shall not be altered and it shall be left to the poor law authority to make such arrangements as Hiay be equitable with the sailor!s or soldier!s wife for the re-imbursement of their expenses out of the allowances so continued.    Thir. class of case Is by far the moid numerous.
The Departments concerned are willing to apply a similar rule in the case of dependants other than a wife and children (i.e. parents and relatives).The remaining members of the conference entirely concurred ir. these proposals.(2) wives.   In these cases there are practical difficulties in the way of the direct continuance Of separation allowance in a rate-aided institution, in that while the woman is sick, she cannot cal!L at the post office to draw her allowance.    (These difficulties do. not however seem materially to impede the drawing of the allotment made by the sailor or soldier and are surmounted in cases in which the mother is an inmate cf a voluntary hospital). The War Office and Admiralty are most unwilling to accept any proposals for the payment of the allowance to the poor law authorities, and with this view the general sense of the the conference was in agreement.    In these circumstances it was agreed   that the best middle course available, was that, on receipt of a notification that a sailor,s or soldierfs wife had entered a rate-aided institution, the issue of separation allowance by the Naval or Military Authorities should be stopped, but the Local Committee should be required to issue for the benefit of the famil?/ an allowance at the rate of the separation allowance.   The first charge upon the allowance would be the expenses which Local Committees are as above stated, already empowered to defray, and the balance of the allowance would be handed to the woman on her discharge from the institution.    It would be open   to. the poor law authorities to recover under their ordinary powers&apos; from that balance a reasonable sum in respect of their expenditure.
7.       The advantage of the proposals now made is that they would effectually dispose of the charge which is sometimes made that the State seizes the opportunity of a dependant entering a rate-aided institution to save its own pocket by stopping an allowance.   It is doubtful how far they Jill meet the  wishes of the Poor Law Authorities amd whether those authorities will be willing in all cases to continue to notify  to the Adiralty or war Office the admission of sailors&apos; or Soldiers1 -wives.   It will not be necessary to continue the present notification of the admission of other dependants.   At the same time, the poor law authorities are not likely to gain any substantial support from   public opinion if they continue their present protest.B. Pension.8.        The question of payment of the pension during the stay of a widow or dependant in a poor law&quot; institution came also under consideration and it was agreed that the same principles should apply.The present practice as regards pension is governed by Articles 1211 and 1245 of the Royal Pay warrant 1914 In accordance with which the Ministry are empowered &quot;to agree with -the Guardians for repayment to them out of the pension of any such pensioner of the amount of relief&quot; at a rate not exceeding the ordinary rate for pauper inmates,   wo system of notificatign by the Guardians on a woman fs admission is in operation but the Guardians at times claim repayment and, where they do so, payment of the agreed sum is made to them direct and the balance, if any, is held over for payment to the woman when she leaves the institution.   Boards ofGuardians
Guardians are advised always to notify *n admission and where they do so payment of the pension to the  joman has hitherto been suspended, and has not been resumed until the woman&apos;s discharge.9,        The conference recommended that there should be an amendment of the Royal Warrant to provide that the widow1s pension although suspended during her stay in the institution should in fact be administered in the form of an allowance of equivalent amount (either by the Local  :ar Pensions Committee or otherwise) to defray the necessary expenses for the upkeep of her home and that any accumulated balance should be paid to her as soon as she leaves the institution. The Guardians jould be left ./ith the right of recovery from the Board after discharge from the Institution.lith regard to children and other dependants the existing practice under ..rhich the pension or allowance con-tinues during stay in a poor law institution   should not, it was agreed, be interfered if 1th.Summary.10.       The Conference therefore found and recommended:-no(l)   That there is/evidence of any serious deficiency or of accommodation for the institutional treatment of the dependants of sailors or soldiers or pensioners;(2)   That the existing system of the stoppage of Separation Allowances during treatment in a rate-aided institution should be modified so as to provide -(a) for the continuance at the usual rate of the separation allo ance notwithstanding the admission to such an institution of a dependant other than the sol3L63?Jls or soldier&apos;s wife; and(b) for the payment by the Local Ear Pensions Committee subject to the conditions above mentioned of an allowance in lieu of, but at the same rateas separation allowance during the Institutional treatment of a sailor&apos;s or soldierrs wife; and
(3)   the existing system of administration of pensions during treatment In a rate-aided institution should he modified so far as to provide for the suspension of payment of pension to a soldierrs widow subject to the condition that an allowance of  tmal amount should be administered by the Local \&apos;p.i- Pensions Committee for her benefit.The Conference further took note of the fact that the Minister of Pensions had contemplated bringing forward a scheme for the medical treatment of the widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors on the plan of a compulsory contribution out of the pension.MATTHEW NATHAN .October 17th 1917,-

APPENDIX VIII. ^IgTC^gTTEE ON INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT.MINUTES   OF   MEETING.The twenty fifth meeting of the Committee rcas held on Thursday October 18th 1917, at Westminster House, MilEJ^ank--.Present.Colonel Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen       (Chairman)Ger.o-r.al Sir George Bullock andColonel Sir Alfred Pearce Gould   withSir Marry Maward, Major II. S. Hart ley, Dr. C.E.Bond.and Mr. More,1.     Sir Arthur Boscawen said that before beginning the business of the meeting he desired to announce that Lieut-General Sir George Bullock M.G.B. had been appointed a member of the Committee to represent the Mar Office in place of Colonel Sir Walter Lawrence, Bart.2.     Minutes.     The minuses of the last meeting were con-firmed subject to the insertion of the word &quot;originally&quot; before the word &quot;proposed&quot; in line 6 page 3.3.     Tuberculosis.(a) Standard Pavilions.     Major Hartley reported on the progress being made with the erection of the Standard Pavilions.     Everything was going on satisfactorily for their erection in Birmingham, St. Helens, Bristol and Derby.     He had been ^iven authority to spend up to  50 for re-productions and advertisements but had only spent  35&apos;on^necessary matters. Me hoped that the tenders would be in for submission to the  - - . Committee in a week or two.     It was quite possible that another Pavilion may. be required for Lancashire.There was a Sanatorium at Pinhoe four miles from Exeter.     If a Pavilion was erected there It would do for advanced cases for Devon and Cornwall.     Ho would bring the natter before the Committee at a subsequent meeting.It was resolved to recommend that the Ministry he-requested to notify the various joint area&apos; Committees . immediately places are open and ready to provide treatment for Tuberculosis. -  , :-. -  .. -Sir Arthur Boscawen said he was desirous of having the question of Standard Pavilions put- on a settled basis. lie-reviewed the position generally and said that the Red   -Cross -Society had Informed the -Committee that for the present at any rate they could not furnish further funds for capital expenditure but that the State was legally and morally bound to find the necessary funds for institutions which were required.The position under the present arrangement with the Treasury was that if the amount required for the capital expenditure Of any particular institution did not exceed  2000 His Majesty&apos;s Office, &quot;of V.orks would provide the. amount, if it exceeded  2000 then the sanction&apos; of&quot; the Treasury had  .-&apos; &apos;&apos; .&apos;&apos;    :- .&apos; . .&apos;v   &quot; &apos; .v   -: m; :     to   &apos;   &apos; -&apos;
to &quot;be obtained.     The Committee should consider the question of the erection of further Pavilions, and recommend their erection to the Llinistry of Pensions wherever they were considered necessary.(b) (b) Need for further accor-imodation:     Mr. Hore saidthat the Local Government Board was advising as to whether there was a deficiency in accommodation for Tuberculosis cases. The Ministry had written to the Local Government Board in Ireland enquiring as to how they were situated in regard to accommodation and haid received a reply that there was not any deficiency in Ireland.     The Insurance Commissioners on the other hand said that there was a deficiency.     The Ministry wa** taking steps to obtain information as to the actual position.(c) Accommodation for Officers:     A general discussion took place as to the necessity for further provision and especially with regard to Officers for whom it was agreed there was not at the present time any demand.     Sir Alfred Iearce Gould said he would watch the position and bring the matter before the Committee if the necessity for accommodation for Officers arose.(d) Cliffville, Stoke-on-Trent*     Major Hartley re-ported on the proposal to utilise this Institution.     There was not any need for further provision for advanced cases at Stoke-on-Trent.     The property in question would need a great deal of money spent on it to put it in order and he advised against talcing it over.It was resolved that the building should not be utilised and that the Town Clerk, Stoke-on-Trent be notified accordingly.(e) Appuldurcombe House. Froxall.     Major Hartley reported on the proposal to use this Institution.     He said it was not unsuitable for advanced cases and not ideal for Colony treatment and was very much out of the way and difficult of access.It was resolved that the building should not be utilised and that,Mr. Harold Pink the Mayor of Portsmouth who had brought the matter before the Committee, be notified accordingly.(f) Farm Colonies.     Major Hartley read a letter dated 10th October from Mr, Cozens Hardy referring to the offer of Mr, R.A*Pilkington to assist in the immediate starting ofa Training Colony for   Tubercaxous discharged men and to provide  5,000 if suitauxe arrangements could be made.     Major Hartley said this raised the whole question of Farm Colony treatment.     He regardod it as essential that if these colonies were established they must be in the nature o  training colonies,     It was resolved to recommend to the Ministry that a letter be written to Mr, Pilkington thanking him for his offer and stating .^iat if he pr0oeedg with his Scheme on lines approved by the Ministry it will be Officially recognised and supported,A
A general discussion took place with regard to the Scheme.     It was considered that the word &quot;Farm&quot; was a nisnoner and should he changed and also that training as farm labourer v;as of no use and too unattractive in most cases tn mon.     Hen needed more than the usual three months treatment in a Sanatoriuru-It was necessary to have a definite Policy on the question and also to decide how far the Provisions of Article 4 of the Royal v:arrant could be applied.     Tho Welsh national Memorial authorities had stated that they would not find the money for workshops in connection with their scheme and considered that the State should do so.     It was resolved that the Committee should agree to recognise the Welsh Colony as it is at present and recommend to the Ministry that treatment allowances and maintenance charges should be paid for up t^ 30 patients..   It was also agreed that Mr* Evans of the Wo^h national Memorial Association shpuld be invited to meet Sir Arthur Boscawen and hr. Eore one day next week.     Sir Arthur Boscawen said he was now prepared to recommend the Institutional Committee for Scot-land to find part of the money for lord Balfour of Burleighs scheme for Farm Colony treatment an*iat the same tine make it a condition that workshops should be erected.A general discussion took place with regard to the class of workshops and trades to be taught in connection with Farm Colony treatment and it was decided to defer the matter to a subsequent meeting,(g) Helling Sanatorium. Correspondence relative to the release of Captain horris R.A.L1.C. from the Army for service at this Institution was placed before the Committee. After a discussion it was resolved to recommend to the Ministry that a letter be written to the War Office asking for Captain Morris&apos; release.     Sir Gee Bullock said he would also make a requestin the proper quarter.(h) Walker Gate Hospital.     Hewcastle-on-Tyne.     Dr, Hartley read a letter dated 17th October he had received from Dr* Coutts with regard to Hewcastle-on-Tyne stating that the Town Council were quite willing for the beds at walker Gate hospital to be used at once for discharged soldiers but they did not agree to the limitation to 35/- per week if the future cast exceeds that amount.     Twelve beds could be reserved for certain but occasionally up to 20 could be provided.     They were in correspondence with the Ministry of Pensions over the matter,4,    neurasthenia.     Home of Recovery,    solders Greon, A letter dated 9th October was read from Mr, Burleigh in connection witn the additional expenditure with the French garden and workshops. The deficit on the estimated maintenance was  222o2f,6., and further capital expenditure had been necessary amounting to  236,     The Secretary was instructed to forward particulars of the former amount to Mr. Eore and the latter to the Hon. Sir Arthur Stanley.5.     Rheumatism Treatment.(a) Question of Treatment.     The return asked for by the Committee of the number of men discharged up to the end pi&quot; September 1917 on account of Rheumatism caused or aggravated by Military Service was furnished by Chelsea showing the number to 5e 10,396.     There were not any figures available for non-attributable cases *It
It was resolved after a general discussion that the question of special treatment he deferred for further c onsi der at ion.(b) Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire.     The offer of this Hotel and Spa bath was considered and it was resolved that the matter be not taken up by this Committee at the present and that a letter be written to Mr. Tucker to that effect and informing him that If on further consideration the Committee decided to utilise his Institution he would be communicated with.6.   Heafct Treatment.   A minute by Sir Alfred Pearce Gould was read with reference to the proposal to provide spe cial treatment for Heart cases at the National Heart Hospital, Westmorland Street.     He pointed out that treatment for discharged soldiers and sailors was carried out efficiently by Physicians all over the Country in well staffed and equipped hospitals and he was adverse to making any provision for Special Heart Hospitals.     Dr. Hartley agreed and the Committee resolved that no special treatment for heart cases was needed beyond that whioh was already feeing given.&apos;V.   Orthopaedics. JLondon; Orthopaedic Hospital.     Sir Arthur Boscawen reported that Kr. Arthur Horley had interviewed him with regard to financial assistance being given to this Hospital for the purpose of building workshops.     They had had 3,000 soldiers through their hands and y;ere treating at present 170.     host of them went back to the Army but about one fifth were eventually invalided out.     The workshops would cost about  700 and three instructors  10 a week.     If they arauld get a grant of  525 they would find the balance and start the workshops at once.They accommodated many discharged soldiers and at the present had 15 as in-patients.After a general discussion it was agreed that Sir Arthur Boscawen should see Major Mitchell and report to a subsequent meeting when the question would be considered.S8   Epilepsy, ^ilfont Colony*    A letter dated 16th October from Mr, Pehn Ciaskell to Captain Lane was read with regard to the question of responsibility for the necessary outfit of Patients entering the Colony.The matter was referred to Br. Bond who agreed to see Mr. Gaskell and report to a subsequent meeting.
241  i.jAPFEHDIX IX.TREATMENT.Report of Schemes etc. submitted during the week ending the 17th October.1.     The &quot;West Sussex Local Committee submitted a scheme fo treatment embodying several Military, Red Cross, and Civil Hospitals.   Subject in certain instances to further information as to terms of&apos; treatment the scheme can be approved.2.     The Hull Local Committee applied for general sanction to use the Southport Hydro Hospital and the Royal Northern Sea Bathing Infirmary Scarborough.   This was given, for cases medically - recommended, the fees for treatment at the former Institution being at the rate .of 26/-   a week with 1/- for special baths and those for the Royal Northern Sea Bathing Infirmary at schedule rates.3.     The Durham Local Committee requested sanction to use the Gilsland Convalescent Home at a fee of 25/- per week. Further information was requested as to the reason why the sanctioned rate of 21/- per week could not be agreed upon.Tho proposal of tho St, Helens Local Committee to use the Hydropathic Hospital Southport was sanctioned.4.     The Aberdare Local Committee requested sanction to use the Aderdare General Hospital for in-patient treatment at schedule rates.    Cases of disease requiring medical and surgical treatment will be sent there.    Although this hospital has no resident medical officer it is attended by all the local panel doctors and as it appears to have met the require-ments of the neighbourhood up to now, the Committee&apos;s proposal -&quot;/as sanctioned.5.     The Warwickshire Local Committee submitted a proposal to utilize the services of a Mr. i&apos;. Yif. cobb for the provision of electrical treatment at a fee of 2/6 per visit. -Further Information has been asked for as to Mr. Cobb&apos;s qualifications.6.     The Elginshire Local Committee submitted a scheme embracing several civil and auxiliary&apos; Institutions.    Of these the Grays Hospital Elgin and the Gordon Casher Red Cross Hospital Fochabers were approved for in-patient treatment, the former at the rate of 3/- per day and the latter at 2/6 per day.    The Gordon Casher Hospital was also approved for out-patient electrical and special treatment but further enquiry was made as to the proposed- rates for ordinary out-patient treatment both at this institution and at the Grays Hospital Elgin.    Information regarding the terms proposed with the other institutions mentioned in the schedule was requested and the Committee were asked to submit a comprehensive scheme for the provision of institutional treatment for discharged men in their area through the Joint Advisory Committee.7.     A letter was received from the Secretary of the National Hospital for Paralysis and Epilepsy, requesting information as to the Ministry&apos;s proposed arrangements with Institutions.    The Secretary was informed of the provisionsof
&apos;(of schedule I and that Local Committees were making arrangements with Hospitals.   A-copy of the correspondence was forwarded&apos; to the London and Middlesex Committees.3.     A letter was received from the Secretary of the Metropolitan Hospital, Kingsland Road, E. requesting informa-tion as to the rules under which they might be recognised as an Institution for the treatment of disabled soldiers.   He was informed of the terms of Schedule I gmd referred to the London Local Committee to whom a copy of the correspondence was sent.

APPENDIX XI. TRAINING-. &apos;Trade Advisory Committees and the Training of Disabled Men. Reuort for ;Igek ending October 17th 1917.*An interesting development took place this week with regard to the training of Hew Zealanders.     Captain H* Richards, the Officer in cliarge of the training of New Zealand limbless soldiers, had had trade union difficulties with regard to the training of disabled Hew Zealanders in a boot factory in Uolverhampton.     As the Hew Zealanders are not discharged until they return to Hew Zealand no wages can be paid to them in addition to their army pay and the trade unions complained that the employer was contributing nothing.     Captain Richards was therefore invited to attend the Trade Advisory Committee (Boot Manufacture;) and it was there agreed that training for Hew Zealanders might be given in accordance with the lines laid down in the recommendations of the Committee and that with regard to the contribution payable by the employer the disabled men should be invited to suggest any kind of war charity to which they would like the money to be applied and on this condition all trade union opposition was waived.Meetings of Trade Advisory Committees.Dental Mechanics-.     October 12th.The recommendations of this Committee have been sent to the Ministry of Pensions and it is hoped that instructions to regulate the training of disabled men in this trade will shortly be issued to Local Mar Pensions Committees.Cinema Trade.   October 16th.Reports were received from Local Technical Advisory Cormiittees with regard to the training of 9 men in Leeds, 8 men in Cardiff, and 0 men in Liverpool as cinenatograph operators. The Trade Advisory Committee went through the lists and found that a number of men had been taken on for training In this trade although they could quite easily have followed their previous occupation, for instance that of insurance agent, checker, and government inspector.     It was therefore decided to send out a recommendation to Local Technical Advisory Committees calling attention to the &quot;Notes on Training&quot; issued by the Ministry of Pensions and cautioning them against recommending Local TJar Pensions Committees to fill up vacancies in the cinematograph training school with men who did not need fresh training.It is interesting to note that 15 out of the 26 men trained were under 24 years of age and that one man of 38, one of 37,  and one of 36 had been trained.Boot iManufacture.     October 17th.It was provisionally agreed to recommend that the first months training should wherever possible be given in a technical school.     Thirty-one different processes were selected and were divided into 4 groups, those requiring 3 months, 4 months, 7 months, and 13 months training.     Scales of wages to be paid by the employer were agreed upon for each of these four groups.    For instance with regard to the 15 months training it was agreed that after the first month spent in the technical school the contribution should be as follows:First
APPSITDIX XI. TR/.IHIHG. &apos;Trade Advisor?/- Committees and the Training of Disabled Men. Report for Week ending October 17th 1917.An interesting development took place this week with regard to the training; of New Zealanders.     Captain H* Richards, the Officer in cliarge of the training of New Zealand limbless soldiers, had had trade union difficulties with regard to the training of disabled Hew Zealanders in a boot factory in Wolverhampton.     As the Hew Zealanders are not discharged until they return to Hew Zealand no wages can be paid to them in addition to their army pay and the trade unions complained that the employer was contributing nothing.     Captain Richards was therefore invited to attend the Trade Advisory Committee (Boot Manufacture.) and it was there agreed that training for New Zealanders might be given in accordance with the lines laid down in the recommendations of the Committee and that with regard to the contribution payable by the employer the disabled men should be invited to suggest any kind of war charity to which they would like the money to be applied and on this condition all trade union opposition was waived.lieetings of Trade Advisory Committees.Dental Mechanics-.     October 12th.The recommendations of this Committee have been sent to the Ministry of Pensions and it is hoped that instructions to regulate the training of disabled men in this trade will shortly be Issued to Local War Pensions Committees.Cinema Trade.   October 16th.Reports were received from Local Technical Advisory Committees with regard to the training of 9 men in Leeds, 8 men in Cardiff, and 9 men in Liverpool as cinematograph operators.. The Trade Advisory Committee went through the lists and found that a number of men had been taken on for training in this trade although they could quite easily have followed their previous occupation, for instance that of insurance agent, checker, and government inspector.     It was therefore decided to send out a recommendation to Local Technical Advisory Committees calling attention to the &quot;notes on Training&quot; issued by the Ministry of Pensions and cautioning them a.gainst recoimnending Local War Pensions Committees to fill up vacancies in the cinematograph training school with men who did not need fresh training.It is interesting to note that 15 out of the 26 men trained were under 24 years of age and that one man of 38, one of 37,  and one of 36 had been trained.Boot. Manufacture.     October 17th.It was provisionally agreed to recommend that the first months training should wherever possible be given in a technical school.     Thirty-one different processes were selected and were divided into 4 groups, those requiring 5 months, 4 months, 7 months, and 13 months training.     Scales of wages to be paid by the employer were agreed upon for each of these four groups.    For instance with regard to the 13 months training it was agreed that after the first month spent in the technical school the contribution should be as follows:First
First two months	10/-Second two months	12/-Third two months	15/-Fourth two months	18/-Fifth two months	21/-**Sixth tvo  months	25/-at the end of this period the man should receive the district wages.     The Committee were unanimous that if adequate training was to be given in a technical school it would be necessary for the Government to give assistance in either hiring or buying the machinery necessary for the technical school*
APPENDIX XII.training.&quot;Report of Scheme submitted or sanctioned during tho week-ended 17th October 1917.1. A Schone submitted by:the Aberdeen Local Committee for training aisabled men in English, Arithmetic, Shorthand and Book-keeping at the School fcoard, has been sanctioned for a maximum period of 6 months on condition that tho fees do not exceed the maximum of 7s Sd weekly.2. An announcement will be inserted in an early issue of the WarPensions Gazette intimating that an Insurance Cornea ny have offered to train selected one-armed officers, lion Commissioned Officers and men of good education as life insurance underwriters.     This work is healthy and free as the men would be practically in business for themselves with remuneration at the rate of  3 a week plus commission.     Only specially selected men are suitable for this employment and appointments can therefore only be mado after personal interview.3. The Liverpool Local Committee have submitted proposals for the training of disabled men in Boot repairing for a period of three months as a minimum.     The actual duration of the course Trill bo determined by experience.     They,have been informed that Boot making and repairing has been declared a Special Trade within the meaning of Instruction 23, and that training in it must accordingly comply with the conditions that have been laid down.4. The Joint Disablement Committee for Central Scotland havesubmitted a scheme for the training of disabled :?ien in a variety of occupations.     The information given was in many ways incomplete, and a letter was therefore sent reminding the Joint Committee of the chief points concerning which they should give information in submitting schemes for training for sanction.The Committee were informed in particular, that training in Commercial or Clerical subjects should, where possible, be given in institutions under the control of the Local Education Authority, and should be confined to men of fairly good general education.    VV. ith regard to Aotor driving and llusic, it was YinniyidPP^ ct.esirable   that separate sanction should be sought In each incLxviauta case in order that the special circumstances of the men whom it was proposed to train might be considered.

MINISTRY   OF   PENSIONS.INSTRUCTIONSon theTRAINING OF WIDOWS.
MINISTRY   OF   PENSIONSINSTRUCTIONSon theTRAINING OF WIDOWS.
INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TRAINING OF WIDOWS.PREFATORY NOTE.The Royal Warrant and Order in Council allow of training being given to the majority of widows in receipt of a pension, namely, those who are in receipt of a minimum pension under Article 11, or of an alternative pension under Article 14. The appended Instructions are for the guid-ance of Local Committees in submitting applications for sanction.The training of widows is on a somewhat different footing from the training of disabled men. In the latter case the State deems that it owes a duty to the man to provide, him with the means of regaining the highest measure of industrial capacity that his disablement allows, if either he is incapable of resuming his former employment, or he would be at a serious disadvantage in pursuing it. In the case of the widow the State is not replacing an earning capacity which has been lost in its service, but offers to assist the widow to add to her income where her domestic needs make a remunerative occupation desirable in her own interest or in that of her children.Hence the Instructions require it to be shown that the training is really called for by the widow&apos;s circumstances (Instruction 4 (a)). Hence also the maintenance allowance provided for in Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant is fixed at a maximum of 12s. Qd. per week, the intention being to provide by this allowance only such amount as is neces-sary to make up the widow&apos;s pension and other means to the amount which will adequately provide for the woman herself and her children during her training. It should not, therefore, be assumed that the allowance, where granted, will always be at the rate of 12s. 6d. per week, or that any allowance at all will necessarily be given. It is not the Ministers intention to take a narrow view in dealing with applications, but it is important, to avoid x   (37)4108   Wt 470 G 87   5000   10/17   E &amp; S
misunderstanding, that Local Committees should remember the difference in character between the allowance provided under Article 6 of the Royal Warrant in the case of dis-abled men under training and that provided for a widow by Article 14 and these Instructions.Conditions of Training.The Minister does not at the present moment propose to indicate any particular occupations for which women could most suitably be trained. This matter is being carefully studied, and a further note will be circulated to Local Committees as soon as possible.Meantime it is desired to draw attention to the points on which, whatever the training desired by an applicant, the-Local Committee should definitely satisfy themselves. They are the following : (1) Whether the person whom it is desired to train is physically fitted and suited by education and general intelligence to undergo the desired course of instruction and the work which the subsequent pursuit of her occupation would involve. Wherever it is possible, certificates of this should be obtained &quot;from the Avonian/s doctor and the institution at which it is pro-posed that she should be trained.(2) Whether, in cases where there are children, satis-factory arrangements can be made for their care during the time occupied by their mother&apos;s training, and, if so, whether there is reason to believe that afterwards the duties entailed by her occupation will not materially interfere with the still more important duties of her home. It will, generally speaking, be very un-desirable for training to be given in cases where there are several children or they are of tender years, unless there are special circumstances which warrant it.Generally speaking it is not desirable that a widow with young children should be separated from them, and in such cases a course of train-ing which obliges the widow to live-away from home should not be arranged. It should usually be possible to arrange for the training to be
given, if it is advisable at all, in the woman&apos;s own district. In exceptional cases, however, the Minister is prepared to sanction training which involves the widow hving away from home for a period, provided he is satisfied that adequate arrangements have been made for the care and custody of the children during the mother&apos;s absence.(3) Whether the institution selected for training is adequately ^ equipped to afford satisfactory results. Where there is a Central Body this can be easily ascertained by finding out whether the institution is one approved of by it, e.g., in the case of Midwifery, the Central Midwives Board, or, in the ease of Massage, the Ihcor-porated Society of Masseuses, should be ap-proached in the matter. In other cases the opinion of the Local Education Authority should be asked, or, if training is to be given in nursing, the local Medical Officer of Health should be consulted.(4) Whether the occupation in which training is to be given affords the widow a reasonable prospect of permanent and remunerative employment. In this connection, not only the present state of employment of the occupation in question should be considered, but also the conditions which are likely to obtain in it after the war. For instance, while at the present time there is a great demand for shorthand typists, it is probable that, when the staffs of the large temporary Government Offices and of the many private businesses which have taken on fresh employees are disbanded, there will be a glut of shorthand typists on the labour market. The Ministry are advised that in this and similar occupations, where there is likely to be a surplus of labour after the war, training should be restricted to persons who have fol-lowed these callings before marriage and only require a short course of instruction in them in order to regain their proficiency. Hence, in view of the severity of competition in women&apos;s
employment after the war, more regard should be paid to the thoroughness of the training given in individual cases than to the number of persons trained.Period of Training.Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant contemplates a normal period of three months&apos; training. This will be the proper period : -(1) where the applicant wishes to resume the occu-pation in which she was employed before marriage;(2) where instruction is sought hi less highly skilled occupations, such as that of a machinist or of French polishing, in which there is a good opening for women and hi which progress sufficient to secure a fair hving wage can be made in three months.There will, however, be occupations of a more skilled or semi-professional character, such as, Midwifery or that of Secondary School Teacher, where a longer period of training is essential to adequate training. The Ministry are prepared to sanction courses of trahiing for more extended periods than three months where the case justifies it.Accounts.Any fees or maintenance allowance authorised to be paid under these instructions should be paid by the Local Committee out of the funds placed at their disposal by the Ministry, and shown separately in the Statement of Receipts and Payments (Form R. 7) sent to the Ministry of Pensions. Fees should not be paid in advance to the institutions at which the training is to be given. Where pre-payment is asked for, it should be pointed out that the Ministry guarantees the payment, and therefore, that the reasons which may render it desirable to require pre-payment in the case of private persons, from whom the fees may or may not ultimately be recoverable, do not apply.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TRAINING OF WIDOWS.Under Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council.1. The following Instructions prescribe the conditions,, under which training may be provided for widows and;, allowances paid under Article 14 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council. These Instructions may be amended by further instructions issued from time to time by the Minister.Persons Eligible.2. Any. widow who has been awarded a pension under either Article 11 or Article 13 of the Royal Warrant and Order in Council may be granted training at the expense of the Ministry.A widow whose pension has lapsed or has been susjiended shall cease to be eligible for training, provided that any course of training already commenced shah not be discontinued on account of such lapse or suspension.Procedure.3. All applications for training and for any main-tenance allowable in respect thereof shall be made through the Local War Pensions Committee of the applicants place of residence, and shall be determined by the Minister of Pensions. The application shall be made on the prescribed form, and the Local Committee shall furnish such further information as is necessary to enable the Minister of Pensions to determine the application.4. A course of   training for a widow will not be sanctioned unless the Minister is satisfied : (a) that training is needed in the applicants interest, regard being had to any pension to which she is entitled and to her domestic circumstances;(6) that the applicant is suited to the occupation for which training is proposed to be given, regard being had to her age, her previous education, and occupation, if any, and for this purpose a statement from the instructor or other person connected   with   the   occupation  for    which
training is proposed to be given and competent to judge of the matter shall ordinarily be obtained by the Local Committee;(c) that there is a reasonable likelihood of the applicant being able to gam a permanent livelihood or substantially to augment her means of hving ^ by means of the training provided.I 5. A course of training will not be sanctioned in the case of a widow with a young child or children under 16 years of age unless the Minister is satisfied that adequate provision will be made for the care of her children during her training; and if the course of training obliges the widow to live away from home and from her child or children the Local Committee shall further under-take that the children shall be visited at least once a month either by a member or by an officer of any suitable organisation in order to ascertain that they are being suitably cared for.6. Where the course of training obliges the widow to live away from home it will be required as a condition of sanction to or continuance of the training that the Local Committee in whose area she receives training shall undertake (a) to make payments of all allowances to the widow during her training, recovery being effected where necessary from the Local Committee of the place where the widow ordinarily resides.(6) to see that she is suitably lodged, if she is not lodged in the institution in which she is being trained, and the necessary arrangements for this purpose shall be made by the Local Committee of the widow&apos;s place of residence. 7. The first month&apos;s training shall be considered a probationary period, and a certificate shall be required by the Local Committee to be furnished at the end of the period by the matron or instructor under or by whom the instruction is being given as to the progress of training. A similar certificate shall be furnished at the end of the i   period of training.8. The fee (if any) for training payable by the Ministry (exclusive of any charge for the maintenance of the woman, if living in the institution in which training is given) shall
not ordinarily exceed 7s. 6d. a week (except for training of a professional character) unless special circumstances are shown to the satisfaction of the Minister.9. A maintenance allowance, in addition to the widow&apos;s pension and allowances, will not be sanctioned under Article 14 (3) of the Royal Warrant and Order hi Council by the Minister of Pensions unless in any case can be shown, either (a) that the widow is obliged in consequence of hertraining to give up or forego a remunerativioccupation; or (6) that she is obliged to live away from her ownhome during her training and needs to maintainsuch home; or(c) that she has to make provision for the care of achild or children at some pecuniary cost in excess of the allowances payable in respect of such children; or(d) any other special circumstances justify it. 10. The amount of the maintenance allowance, if anjr,will not exceed 12s. 6d. per week, and will be determined by the Minister, on the report of the Local Committee. The whole or any portion of the allowance may be paid to another person in the interest and on behalf of the woman or any child of hers as the Minister may determine.Ministry of Pensions, October, 1917.

APPENDIX XW254REPORT OP THE MEETING OF THE PERMANENT&quot; COI/IMITTEE OF THE ALLIED CONFERENCE.The Permanent Committee assembled-at Heetminsiyer - House on Tuesday, the 9th October, having been met by Lt. Colonel^ Stanton&quot; and brought to London the previous day.   At 10.30 a.m. the members were   introduced go the Pensions Minister who addressed them in v/estminboer House, and a reply was made in French by the Chairman (President) Monsieur Bourrillon.   The Committee then withdrew tfl the Committee Room, for its first meeting. The fpllowing took place:-Letters of regret were received from the members who wore prevented from assisting.The Minutes of the meeting of 11th and 1.2th July in Pari3 were duly confirmed.Question of authorising the additional members added to the Permanent Committee was duly considered and the new members appointed by the various   Dominions were approved.It was further decided to send letters to each of the Allied Governments with regard to the Regularisation of the number of its members on the Permanent Committee.The various Allied Nations were requested to send in t* the Headquarters of the Allied Conference in Paris the nQminations for Honorary Members, which had been proposed at the meeting in Paris, held on 12th July,It was further decided that each delegation of Allied Nations should appoint a correspondent to notify matters o,f import-ance and interest to the Headquarters in Paris, with a view to their publication, if considered desirable, in the Quarterly Review.
Discussion followed on the question of a central laboratory research institute in respect of -(a) Its Composition(b) Its administration and direction(c) Its financial organization.It was eventually decided that it would be best in the interests of disabled sailors and soldiers if each Allied Nation takes its own steps in regard to laboratories and experimental institutions, and that the results of the investigations of the Allied Nations should be placed at the disposal of the Central Committee and should also be stvailable for the information of any o  the Allied Nations who may wish for information in any particular subject or research.   A central laboratory and experimental institute in Paris was not considered advisableThe members proceeded in the afternoon of Tuesday to visit the Orthopaedic Hospital at Shepherd&apos;s Bush, and later visited the Battersea Local War Pensions Committee at work and were greatly interested in this branch of the Pensions Ministry&apos;s activities, which appealed Very largely to the French and American Representatives.On the 10th October the members visited Roehampton and were shown over the whole of the Institution and the working of the various sections.    In the afternoon a visit was paid to Regent Street Polytechnic, and in the evening a dinner was given by the Government to the Permanent Committee at Lancaster House, at which the Pensions Minister addressed the Committee and to which Monsieur Bourrillon suitably replied.The second meeting of the Permanent Committee took place at 5, Old Palace Yard on the morning of 11th October.

Sir Arthur Boscawen proposed to the members present that consideration should be given tQ the question of the next Conference of the Allies onDisablement
Disablement and proposed, if no objection was taken, that,- the next &quot; Conference should take place in London towards the end of May.    It was suggested that each Government should nominate its regular delegates, who should have power to vote and should also notify the Pensions Ministor of other members who would assist their delegates in representing views at the Conference to be held In London.i-.fter discussion it was unanimously decided to accept the suggestion offered by the Pensions Minister that the next meeting of the Allied Conference should take place in London towards the end of Kay, and the Chairman, Monsieur Bourrillon, expressed the deep and grateful thanks pf all members present for theahospital-ity which had been extended to them by the British Government on the present occasion.A further discussion arose as to limiting the number of nominees by the various Allied Governments.   It was finally decided that no limit should actually be placed on the number sent, but that the names of all persons to be present to represent the views of the various Allied Governments and Dominions should be notified to the&quot;Pensions Ministry in gecefe time to enable the necessary arrange-ments to be made.On a proposal by the Chairman the question of financial provision for the further Allied Conference was duly considered.   The Chairman stated that in accordance with the decision come to on the 11th and 12th July, it was estimated that the cost of the Termanent Committee of the Allied Conference in Paris, including maintenance of the necessary staff, upkeep of the Quarterly Review -land other incidental expenses, such as stationery, etc., had been estimated to amount to 150,000 francs per annum.   Towards this sumunderstood that the French Government were prepared to pay a &quot;contribution of 30,000 francs per annum.   Lt. Colonel Stantdncommunicated
communicated to the Committee that he had the authority of Sir Arthur Boscawen to state that the Pensions L-inister would ask the British Treasury to contribute a sum of equivalent amount to that granted by the Trench Government towards the expenses of the Permanent Committee of the Allied Conference.     The United States Representative, General Birmingham, notified that he would place the same request before his. Government and Monsieur Mouravieff-Apostol made the same statement with regard, to the Russian Government.     These representations total an amount of 120,000 franc out.of the 150,000 francs required.   The remainder of the delegates agreed to notify their respective Governments with a view to the smaller nations and states, including the Dominions, talcing part in the share of the expenses.The proceedings then closed for the day and the members were taken to Clarence House, St. James1, where they were received by H.R.Ho The Duke of Connaught.A visit to Colder^ Green Hospital was paid in the afternoon and St. Dunstanls was visited at 4 p.m*On 12th October the Representatives of the Allied Governments were taken to Brighton, where by arrangements with the r.:ayor and Corporation they were shown over the Hospital in the Pavilion, Queen Mary&apos;s Workshops and the Diamond Cutting Training Classes which have been instituted at Brighton, and which are being, it is understood, considerably extended.The President thanked the Mayor and Corporation for their interesting visit and as it was his last opportunity of doing so he expressed to the British Government the grateful thanks of all members of the Permanent Committee for the hospitality and the facilities extended to them to study the very interesting and successful schemes adopted in England for the training and treatment of disabled men.On Saturday the foreign Allied Members returned to Prance-
APPENDIX XVI258ORGANIZATION   JRANCH.Extracts from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 17th October, 1917SWINTON LOCAL COMMITTEE.The payments all appear to be in order.   Investigation is very thorough and much visiting is done.   This Committee found difficulty over Class W. men as the following examples will show:-Two men In Class W. Reserve are absolutely unfit for work.   They were both in the Labour Battalion.   Letters and Doctors1 Reports have been sent to the Paymaster but no reply was received in one oase for six weeks and in the other for seven weeks.Complaints seem to be general as to the working of the Nottingham Pay Office, which is causing considerable increase in Recoverable Advances both to wives and dependants.Another difficulty is over men sent home for a fort-night pending discharge without money, and the Inspector states that they-at present only have the wife&apos;s Separation Allowance &quot;to live upon which is insufficient. He asks if it would not be possible to arrange for Local Committees to treat th^se men as if they were already discharged. An extraot of this Report is being sent to the War Offioe.LANCASHIRE &amp;OCAL COMMITTEE.Hastington Sub-Committee.The case-papers were examined by the Inspector and found to be in order.   This is a compact district and investi-gation is&apos;simple.   All payments appear to be in accordance with the Regulations,The Inspector for the South Midland area, comprising Bedfordshire. Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, Bedford Borough, Luton Borough and Watford, states that this area presents a curious contrast in efficiency of organization.     The three efficient Committees have paid Secretaries and the remainder have Honorary Secretaries.BEDFORDSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.    (Unpaid Secretary.)The Local Committee meets at the Shire Hall, Bedford. There are no Suo-Committees.   There are seven Petty Sessional Msisions and in each of these there is a District Head.   In every case the District Head has representatives working under him.in the villages of his distriot.   One of these Heads has expressed himself as unfavourable to this arrangement, but I am
afraid there is little inclination to alter it under eyisting oircumstances.   The whole organization requires overhauling. The Inspeotor is to attend the meeting of the Bedfordshire Local Committee with a view to persuading them to re-organise their administration.HERTFORDSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE   (unpaid Secretary.)The same remarks apply as to the Bedfordshire Local Committee.   Here again there are no Sub-Committees and the machinery is cumbersome.   There are 178 &quot;Local Friends&quot; scattered over the County and in only one instanoe have they been called together by the District Head in the Hatfield Petty Sessional Division, where monthly meetings of the helpers are held.   It ia not uncommon for a &quot;Local Friend&quot; to write saying that she has been away for some weeks and that she thinks that somebody should be appointed to take her work tem-porarily.   An interview with Sir Charles Longmore, Clerk to the Local Committee, has so far had little result as he is emphatically opposed to any alteration.The Hertfordshire Local Committee meets in London and their meetings are very brief. The following is an interesting extract from the Agenda of this Committee^ meeting:-&quot;To consider report of the Treasurer as to the possi-bility of bringing all Supplementary Separation Allowances within the Regulations of the Ministry of Pensions,&quot;The Inspector is going to attend this meeting.HUNTINODONSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.  (Paid Secretary.)The work continues to be very capably performed by everybody associated with it.BEDFORD B0ROJGH LOCAL COMMITTEE.,(Paid Secretary.)The work is going on most satisfactorily.LUTON BOROUGH LOCAL COMMITTEE.    (Paid Secretary.)This Committee^ work is well done and the Inspector has no criticism to offer.WATFORD LOCAL COMMITTEE.    (Unpaid Seoretary.)The work is carefully done so far as it goes.   The Inspeotor is anxious for this Committee to appoint efficient visitors in the town as the organization in this respect appears to have broken down.   Whilst at Watford the Inspector visited the School of Arts and Crafts in company with Mr. Soloman, a member of the Technical Eduoation Committee.   The Secretary was interviewed with a view to getting out a scheme for training evolved by this Committee and Mr.Soloman offered to give several hours a day to help found the scheme and will do everything possible to conduce to its success.CARMARTHENSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Inspeotor reports that it is most difficult to
check the allowances paid in a County like Carmarthenshire and it is only by close cross examination that the weak spots can be detected.   The County is dealt with as a whole so that if any particular district is under suspicion of not carrying out the Regulations, their cases cannot be investigated separately as the numbers run consecutively on the Local Conmiittee&apos;s files and all parts of the County are mixed together. Further disallowances of cases have taken place in the Llanelly Rural District Committee and also in the Ammon Valley Sub-Committee.   In some cases the Inspector had to stop payment.NOTTINGHAMSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.There is a paid staff of three clerks, one man and two women.   The records show that the County is well organised, there being a representative and worker in every part who would advise and help soldiers and their dependants.    There is regular correspondence between representatives and the Head-quarters.   The case records are well kept but there is no proper filing arrangements.    The accounts are good, a simple and clear system is in^operation.   Altogether a very satisfactory Central Office, the work being efficiently done with keenness, consid-eration and sympathy.Mansfield Sub-Committee.All applications are dealt with at the Committee^ Headquarters, which are centrally situated and easily accessible to those desirous of help.   The Office belongs to Mr.Clement who is well-known to all soldiers and their dependants and they always refer to him with their troubles.The expenditure is light but this is entirely due to the liberality of the employers of the men at work.   A large proportion of the wives and dependants have been so liberally helped that their present incomes with Government allowances are considerably higher than before the enlistment of the respective husbands.   The accounts are well kept and the case records are good,Sutton-in-Ashfield Sub-Committee.Population 84,000.   Principle industries Mining andHosiery..Twenty lady visitors look after the wives and dependants in receipt of grants.   The Committee meets weekly and considers every application thoroughly.   Generally speak-ing the wives and dependants are well looked after and helped in every way possible in addition to being given grants. Only 10/- a week is paid for staff, rent, lighting and heating.DERBY LOCAL COMMITTEE.Buxton Suo-Committee.The organization of this office is good.   The accounts are well kept and clear.   The work of the Committee is thoroughly well known in Buxton.    The whole of the work is voluntarily performed.*
MONTHLY   REPORT.SCHEMES FOR LOCAL COMMITTEES.Since the Report made on the 19th September one application under Section 3 of the Naval and Military War Pensions, &amp;c,(Administrative Expenses) Act, 1917, for a separate Local Committee has been received, viz., from the Town Council of Chepping Wyccmbe.    The observations of the Buckinghamshire County Council have been requested.In two cases since the same date the Minister of Pensions has decided that the application for a separate Local Committee should be granted.

9 % QL 0 eJAPPEITPTK XVIII. MMMORANIUM CF CONFERENCE.A Conference was held in Lord Derbyfs room at the War Office on ths afternoon of the 18th October when there were present:-Lord Derby Mr. HoageLt.Gen. Sir C.F.IT. Macready; Surgeon General Sir W. Babtie Sir Charles Karris Sir Matthew Nathan.The object of the Conference has only been veryroughly indicated to Mr. Hodge.   Six matters were dealt with,generally as indicated below:-(1)       Lord Derby said that the 17ar Office were desirous ofthe Ministry of Pensions taking over the charge of disabledmen as soon as it was certain that their disability made itimpossible for them to return to Military duty, such as:-(i)   Limbless men at Brighton and Roehampton.(ii)   Certain classes of Orthopaedic cases.(iii)   Neurasthenics.(It?)   The insane, of whom there are at present some 3,400 certified cases.The v7ar Office considered that these men were the proper charge of the Pensions Ministry and that in order that their treatment might be most effective and continuous it should be taken in hand at the outset by the authority responsible for carrying it through.Mr. Hodge pointed out that if the War Office wishes were met in the way they had indicated it would he necessary for them to furnish the Pensions Ministry with such staff and accommodation as were required.Lord Derby thought as regards accommodation that Institutions, such as Brighton, could be handed over as theystood
stood to the Ministry, and as regards Staff, that this matter was now in the hands of the National Service Ministry,Sir Matthew Nathan reminded Lord Derby of the Meeting that had taken place in his room shortly after Mr. Barnes had become Pensions Minister when Lord Derby specifically agreed that men should be kept by the Army for so long as they required in-patient treatment and accommodation was available and pointed out that the men will be very much more difficult to deal with when they are no longer under Military discipline.The adjutant General referred to great difficulties now existing owing to the attempt to impose such discipline.Considerable stress was laid by Sir C Harris and others on the War Office side cn the fact that the Pensions Minister would have to provide administration, staff and accommodation after the war when those of the &quot;:ar Office would no longer be available and therefore had better make preparations at once.   On the other side it was argued that it was wasteful to make such new provision for a service that would only last a few years after the war and that there was no real reason why the War office should not continue to look after the progressively decreasing ?iork wfr-&apos;-.h their progressively decreasing staff.Ultimately Mr. Hodge stated that he would give consideration to the War Office proposal with a view to assisting them as much as possible.(2) Sir W. Babtie next referred to War Office desiringno longer to take re-admitted cases.   At present there were some 1,700 of these undergoing treatment and it was suggested by the Adjutant General that the Army Medical authorities were getting anxious as to the number of hospital- beds available for serving soldiers. (There are some 320,000 beds available in the United Kingdom).
Sir Matthew Nathan stated that the right o  getting discharged men re-admitted into Military Hospitals was of very great value to the Ministry of Pensions.    It enabled the men to be sent to suitable Institutions where there was a well equipped technical staff to deal with them in the vicinity of their own homes.   The organising of a central hospital to deal with discharged soldiers of all classes would very imperfectly replace the present arrangements.    This matter was not further pursued. (3) The question of taking over the boarding of soldiersand the assessment of their pensions was next raised by Lord Derby, who read extracts from a letter received from Sir Launcelotte G-ubbins, which indicated that the Ministry in addition to taking over the Permanent Board at Chelsea contemplated setting up boards of Civil Medical Officers in connection with the reney;al of Pensions.Sir Matthew Nathan explained how a start was being made with this as regards the re-examination of Neurasthenics in the Ministry&apos;s North-Western area and that it was proposed to extend this system gradually to deal with neurasthenics all over the Country and should it prove a success to enlarge the functions of the special boards so that they should deal with all classes of invalided men coming up for renewal of pension.The system was one of panels Qf doctors who would only give part time to the work and would continue their civil practice. . It would require some time to get into operation and would not affect the first assessing Board as this had to determine whether the man should continue in of be discharged from the Army, which wasrof course outside the responsibility of the Ministry of Pensions.The
The War Office representatives   urged the immediate taking over   of the five renewal boards at Chelsea and Lord Derby made light of the fact that the practical effect of this would be the payment of highe^ fees to the Members. j(4) Reference was made to a letter that had been;&apos;sent by the War Office to the Pensions Ministry-proposing the immediate transfer -to the latter of Sir John Goll/ie&apos;s Special Board in London and in view of the comparatively small number of neurasthenic cases that were now sept back to the Army the War Office stated they were quite prepared to leave the responsibility for determining whether a man should or should not be discharged to the Special Board even when it came under the Ministry. (5) The Alternative Schemes for providing at Chelseathe additional accommodation required for 800 clerks were discussed.   Lord Derby absolutely refused to consider the utilization of the wards in Chelsea Hospital for this  -purpose.   The Mi&amp;itary Authorities seemed to consider that further encroachment of the parade ground at the Duke of YorkTs Headquarters was impossible unless the Pensions Ministry would undertake to vacate the premises immediately at the end of the war.   The other sites in the neighbour-hood viz;- Burton Court and the grounds of Chelsea Hospital were mentioned, together with the undesirability of the further splitting up of the pension award staff that would be involved by the occupation of either of these sites.Lord Derby promised to look into the matter and thecommunicate with/Pensions Minister.
(6) Mr. Hodge handed Lord Derby a letter on thesubject of the delay of Record Offices in sending to Chelsea the details necessary for fixing the pensions of discharged men and the consequent hiatus between the cessation of pay and commencement of pension during which only an inadequate temporary allowance was paid.   Uie Minister pressed for the continuance of pay istntil pension v/as fixed.Lord Derby expressed entire agreement in the Minister&apos;s view as to the importance of there being no hiatus.     He was   suprised that there had been failure in this matter to the extent suggested and asked that the details of 20 cases should be sent to him.   This was promised.M.N.19th October 1917.
