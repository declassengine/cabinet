CRW/025.Weekly Report on Russia, XXVi (October 15th, 1917. )Thg New Government.After long de^ljy Kerenski has succeeded in forming a new Government, which is a real Coalition in the sense that the bourgeoisie are no longer in a Minority and will not be forced to subscribe to the orders of the C.W.S.D.     The Socialist members of the Government are Kerenski, Avksentyev, Nitikin, Prokopovich, Malyantovich and Gvozdev.     Of these the first four are well-known, having all served in Keren^ki&apos;s former Coalition.     They all belong to the most moderate wing of the Socialist party.     The newcomers Malyantovich and Gvozdev are equally moderate.     Malyantovich is a- f :Moscow barrister od some distinction and was in the running for the Ministry of Justice some months ago.     Gvozdev, the new Minister of 3abour,was more prominent before than he has been since the Revolution.   Under, the old regime he was the head of the labour representatives in the War Industrial Committees, which were pase-sided over by Guehkov and Konovalov.     It will $s remembered that one of the acts that precipitated the Revolution wan the order issued by Protopopov for the arrest of these Labour representatives. It is a good sign that Konovalov and Gvozdev should be in the same Cabinet together, the former being the   representative of the bi&amp; industrialists, the latter of labour.Two other appointments which are satisfactory are those of Prokopovich, Minister of Pood Supplies, and Avksentyev,   ?Iinister of Agriculture.     The importance of these two offices at the present moment need not be emphasised.     It is essential that these two
dfbartments should work together in very close relations.    Un-fortunately in the former Coalition, which included Chernov, this was never the case, as Chernov, by his policy of expropriation, simply obstructed the efforts of those who were doing their best to restore order.     Prokopovieh is the leading representative of the Co-operative Societies, whose wbik has been one of the* -most healthy signs of BusSian life.     At the recent Democratic Congress the Co-operative Societies voted solidly for the reSolu-tions of the moderates,     Avksentyev, Minister of Agriculture, is not a powerful personality, hut a man of sane and practical views. His attitude as regards the war is that of Socialists of the Plekhanov type;   before the Revolution they worked on the same paper prigyy   in Paris, which strongly supported the idea &amp;f war to the end.     His agrarian programme is far less drastic than that of Chernov, and he can be relied upon po hold his hand during the war so as to avoid any stirring up of class feeling.     What is needed at present in the Ministry of Agriculture is a policy of conciliation.     The Land Committeesjestablished by Chernov all over the country acted in the post high-handed fashion,as they could always rely upon the support of Petrograd so long as Chernov was in offioe.     Their policy of settling the land question before the meeting of the Constituent Assembly caused an outcry all over Russia, and constant protests were sent in both by landowners and peasants.     Conflicts of this kind only aggravated the already critical condition of food supplies.Of the non-Socialist Ministers the most important appointment is that of Konovalov  who returns to the Ministry of Commeroe and Industry, which he occupied in the first provisional Government. v,e is also to act for Iterenski in the latter&apos;s absence, thus step-ping into the position formerly held byNeksasov.     This change Is
is most significant.   So long as Nekrasov was Kerenski1s right hand man no negotiations with the bourgeoisie in general and the Cadets in particular were likely to be very successful. Nekrasov is lacking neither in ability nor experience, but is accused of having no strong convictions and of having committed the mistake of flattering the mob so as to keep his own position, Whatever his motives (it must be remembered that Petrograd now more than ever is a hot-bed of scandal and gossip) his influence over both Kerenski and Tereshchenko, both of them younger men without much political experience, is generally considered to have been unfortunate.   The Cadet party, through whose support Nekrasov rose to a high position in the Duma, are unanimous in condemning the &quot;opportunism&quot; of Nekrasov,. and his association with Kerenski was rightly or wrongly regarded by them as fatal to a real Coalition Government.The other Cadets in the Ministry, Kishkin, Smirnov and Tretyakov, are all of them Moscow business men.     They are not the most prominent men in the Cadet party, but it is for that very reason that they have been chosen.    If the new Coalition is to be a Government of Conciliation it would be unwise to begin by appointing men so closely associated with certain &apos; fixed ideas as Kilyukov.     It v/ould only mean creating difficulties at the outset.     Kilyukovrs exclusion does not mean that he will not be consulted, but he will remain, for the present at any rate, behind the scenes.Prospects for the Future.In spite of a real Coalition Government the future cannot be described as a bright one. The Germans have again advanced in the Gulf of Riga and may before long threaten Reval.     With .\
purely Socialist Government this would probably have meant another political crisis, and it is therefore a blessing that this news should come after Kerenski&apos;s success in   forming a new Government. The danger cf each German advance has been more political than military,  and there is nothing which has so paralysing an effect in every sphere of. life as a series of political crises.     The Germans have recognised this and there is little doubt that their next move will be to provoke another political crisis during November.     Private reports from Switzerland and Stockholm shew-that the Germans are making desperate efforts to support the Maximalists in Petrcgrad in their political propaganda.   The latter have now got control over the Sovyets both in Petrograd and Hoscow in a way they never had before, and are using the Sovyet as a rallying ground for a desperate bid for power. Bad as this is, it is better that both the Government and the Sovyet should be face to face with realities.    So long as the Scvyet had a small moderate majority the Government could not ignore it and was unable to shake off its clogging influence. Now it can fight it and abandon all attempts at compromise or reconciliation.   The large Maximalist majorities at public &apos; meetings give an exaggerated impression of their strength both in the towns and In the country.     The vast majority of Russians would never accept a Maximalist Government, as they know that the inevitable result would be civil war, and their instinct cf self-preservation tells them that the salvation of Russia lies in coalition and conciliation.In this connection it is worth noticing how this instinct of self-preservation has asserted itself each time Russia has been threatened with civil war.     The most striking example was
the collapse of the Kornilov movement.     There&apos; is little doubt that Kornilov had the backing of the vast majority of moderate men right up to the last moment.     Why, then, his sudden collapse two days after his ultimatum?     We may not be far wrong in assert-ing that the imminent prospect of civil war was averted by this same instinct of self-preservation.   The success of Kornilov after a struggle would have meant the triumph of one extreme, and would have threatened all kinds of violence and dangers in the future.   His sudden collapse meant that the vast majority of reasonable people deserted him in favour of what they considered the safest   course, viz. Kerenski&apos;s policy of a Coalition on a broad basis.     It is the strength of this instinct among the Russian people that offers the best hope for the future.    It is a commonplace in the West that when things are blackest in Russia the air suddenly clears, and it may well be that this Instinct of self-preservation will keep the Russians on the path of safety in their darkest moments.British Public Opinion andi Russia.There are many signs of the extreme sensitiveness both of the Russian Government and of the Russian people towards criticism in this country of their failures.   They feel very acutely the fact that their military collapse has prolonged the war and caused a much greater strain to the Allied armies on the Western front. Though their fears that the Allied Governments may, during the winter, make terms with Germany at Russia&apos;s expense are without foundation, they cannot be Ignored, because, however unreasonable they may be, they nevertheless exist.     They are kept alive by criticisms in the British and French press.     in some cases these criticisms are just, in other cases unfair.      But, however that may be, they are carefully collected by German agents in Russia
with a view to sowing suspicion against Britain In particular. Official expressions of sympathy from here* however unnecessary they may seem, always have a good reception and have already done good.   Whatever happens in Russia at the present moment will remain deeply engraved in the minds of this and the next generation, and, iff their remembrance after the war is that when their country was at its lowest, they received both moral and*material support from the West, this fact alone&apos;will do much to smooth relations between Britain and Russia after peace has been concluded.16.10.17RAL.
