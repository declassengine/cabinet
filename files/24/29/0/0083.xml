(This Document is the Property efBritannic f$ajettv&apos;s Government)   .V.-* *sDEPAKEMiSHT 01-&apos; IHJ&apos;0KMATI01T I1TTELLIGMCS BTJHEAU.WEEKLY     RkpOHf!     OH     Ci^EMMY. S3 October, 1917.1.       It is quite clear that though no definite event has happened since the last report, the German Government is again involved in a very serious crisis.     The Lmperor is still away, and will not he hack for some days.     Capelle!s resigna-tion has not yet been announced, and there can be little doubt that when the Emperor returns he will have immediately to face tbe problem of appointing.a new Chancellor.     There seems ? general agreement that it is impossible that Michaelis should continue in office, for he has apparently no control of the situation, and his want of political and parliamentary exper-ience is fatal.     He no doubt accepted the office of Chahcel-lor from patriotism and from a sense of official duty;    indeed, he is not the first person to believe that the consciousness of oners own rectitude and sense of official duty might ;counter-balance one&apos;s inexperience and incapacity.     But he has also seriously compromised himself by trying to make Capelle the scapegoat.     It is stated in the Yorwarts that v/hen Capelle made his statement in the Reichstag about-the mutiny, he read it from a manuscript.     The conclusion is therefore drawn that it had been approved by the ChanoeM.or; and Michaelis, by demanding his resignation, or accepting his offered resignation, is putting himself into the posi-tion that ho is trying to save his own position by throwing over his subordinai-e.If, however, a new Chancellor is to be appointed, it will be impossible to avoid facing the whole question, in-cluding German war policy and the internal constitutional
-B-problem, at &amp;noe.   The Liberal and Socialist papers are appar-ently demanding that the Bmperor in choosing a new Chancellor shall depend on the advice not of the military chiefs and his personal entourage- - the Hin&amp;enburgs, the Lu&amp;en&amp;orffs, Eulen-burgs, etc. - but shall consult the political leaders.     They maintain that the system.of appointing the Chancellor &quot;from above&quot; (von oben) has failed and must cease-     This means in effect that the Chancellor shall be chosen in accordance with the v/ishes of the majority of the Reichstag;    if this view is practically accepted, it 7/ould inevitably follow that he could only hold office so long as he was agreeable to those to whom he owed his appointment, and his responsibility to the Reichs-tag would be established.     The papers of the Right strongly oppose this view, which they say means the introduction of parliamentary government.     The Deutsche Tagesseitung fOctober 18) writes:&quot;This, if correct, means that the Parliamentary parties are erdeavcuring to cause the fall of the highest Zoz 6:t?al official, and to influence the Crownls decision decisively cocccming his person - in other words, to bring direct p?.tio^ure on the Crown to sacrifice the Chancellor tc the Parliamentary majority.     An explicit protest, it eCd.^, must be laised against such proceedings from the stcwlpoint 01 the Imperial Constitution, quite apart from the peiscual question&apos;&apos;&apos;.It is quite olear that the more extreme parties on the Right would be prepared to go to great lengths in opposing the demand of the liberals and Socialists;   the Doutsche aeit-qng says that &quot;the crisis demands a radical solution;   the Rsichs-tag should only be summoned again to receive the news of its dissolution&quot;, and they have gone so far as expressly to use the word &quot;dictatorship&quot;;   the Yor?rs,rts (October 15) says: &quot;Only two solutions exist, parliamentarisation or a dictator&quot;. But, as it points out, a dictatorship would mean the disinte-gration of the German iimpire.     &quot;The Pan-Oormans, in wishing for a dictator,.prove that they kno?/ the soul of the German
people as little as the psychology of foreign nations&quot;.It is certain that tbe Emperor will find a very difficult task awaiting him on his return,2.      Quite apart from this internal question, tbe appoint-ment of a new Chancellor would also involve a decision between the advocates of an &quot;agreed&quot; pe^ce and a &quot;German&apos;&apos;&apos; peace. Kuhlmann is probably the strongest candidate of the first party;   the others have only Tirpitz and Billow, either of whom seems to be completely impossible.     Apparently Ktlhlmann is in reality committed to the complete evacuation and restoration9of Belgium in principle;   ha has, purely for technical reasons, refrained from stating this publicly, but we hear from Sir Walter Townley that he has let it be known through the Minister of the Netherlands at Berlin that he would be prepared to give an answer to this effect to any cuestion directly put to him from any member of &quot;the Entente;   and all indications available from other sources confirm this.     The strong declaration about Alsace-Lorraine is olearly intended to be the counterpart of a surrender on the Belgian point;   by making this declaration before he makes any public pronouncement about Belgium, he has strengthened his potition as a patriotic Serbian, but he contin-uts to be strongly attacked by the Psn-Ger^ans, who try to in-jure his position by attributing to him &quot;English proclivities&quot;.3.       It is not improbable that the German Government may be influenced by a fear that they may not be able to hold their position in the Plemisb low country throughout the winter;   if this is so, it would be of enormous importance to them to do all they can to make some cleft in the opposing alliance before the retreat actually takes place.    0-ic method of doing this has been to put forward the Alsace-Lorraine question prominent-ly and thereby to create a feeling of annoyance with Prance
among those luglish parties who - it was hoped - would object that England had not entered the war in order to restore these provinces to Praice and could not reasonably be asked to con-tinue it for this purpose.     This has, however, for the moment failed owing to the strong line taken by Mr. Asouith and by the English Liberal press, for instance the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. Another method of doing this would be to let it be understood in Russia that things are moving rapidly towards an understanding with England on the basis of a peace by which Germany would frankly accept English terms regarding Belgium.     It would he easy to make the Russians believe that they were being deserted or ignored by the British Government.     &quot;with the numerous means which the Germans have oi influencing Russian opinion, both among the reactionaries and among the Bolshe-viks, this would be comparatively easy for them.   And the seed would fall on receptive ground;   for Russia, from the depths of her misery, looks in vain for encouraging senti-ments in the British Press, and is already more than half convinced that we mean to abandon her.J.
