Colonel Jones      32 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917.123SECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 21.Week ended lUh October.NAVAL OPERATIONS.After a week of aerial reconnaissance, during which a Russian battery at Tserel Baltic, was successfully bombed, the Germans effected a landing on Osel on Friday, October 12th, under cover of the fleet, and have already (October 16th) occupied Arensborg and the greater part of the Island. The Russian resistance is continuing towards the north-east, where they are gradually retiring across the causeway to Moon ; but the Sworbe Peninsula in the south-west of the Island is cut off. In the meantime Dago has also been attacked, but, it is believed, so far without serious result, and no landing has as yet been reported.The capture of Osel is of primary strategic importance to the Germans, since the Russian batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula formerly prevented their access to the Gulf of Riga ; of secondary importance is the Russian loss of their forward aviation stations which were located on the Island.The present situation may be considered to be serious, but not hopeless, and there is no immediate threat to the Gulf of Finland. The entrance to the latter is completely blocked by a Russian minefield which is suitably defended by heavy gun batteries, while the channels through Sele Sund and Moon Sund are impracticable to all but small craft, there being only 14 feet tof water in the former and 22 feet in the latter. In addition, Moon Sund is mined and supported by batteries both on Moon and the mainland, while the advanced submarine and destroyer base at Rokegul, near Hapsal, is only a few miles to the north.It seems quite possible, therefore, that the next German objective4 will be a landing in force somewhere in the neighbourhood of Pernau, which will have the effect not only of turning the right flank of the Russian armies, but will also enable the enemy to drive a wedge north towards Revel, with the further object of completely isolating Hapsal and the adjacent islands, and thereby materially assisting the fleet to reduce the danger from Dago and to force the minefield in the entrance of the Gulf of Finland. It is to be observed that in organising their defences at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland, the Russians laid their outer minefield i^such a direction as to be supported on either flank by the batteries on Dago and the Rusaro respectively, leaving the centre to be protected by the battleships of the fleet. It will be seen, therefore, what great importance is attached to the forts at the north end of Dago.Navigation in the western part of the Gulf of Finland usually closes in November or Pecember. The Gulf of Riga is seldom frozen in the middle, but it freezes for a considerable distance from the shores in most winters, though the entrance at Irben Strait is seldom closed before the middle of January.Light Cruiser Squadrons carried out a sweep in the Northern part of the North Sea North Set. in consequence of a report of a suspicious steamer in Norwegian waters, but nothing was seen by the cruisers.   Another light cruiser squadron was sent to make a reconnais-sance in the Skagerrak, but the operation was abandoned on account of bad weather. Later information goes to show that the report was probably unfounded.Minelaying operations by submarines have been carried &apos;out in the Heligoland Bight, Minelayiag-and additional deep mines have been laid off south-west coast of England.The Armed Merchant Cruiser. &quot; Champagne &quot; was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy -Casualties, submarine off the coast of County Down, 55 lives being lost.The Sloop &quot; Begonia,&quot; which has been, missing for some days south-west of Ireland, must now be regarded as lost.(C 690)  Wt.   .   50   10/17  H &amp; S x
The armed yacht &quot; Kethailes &quot; was sunk as the result of a collision with the S.S. &quot; Leicestershire.&quot;Flanders. R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on Sparappelhoekaerodrome and Thourout and Lichtervelde railway junctions, and also on trains, the total weight of bombs dropped being 1\ tons.The weather has been unfavourable for flying during most of the week, but some patrols have been carried out. One enemy machine was shot down in flames, and enemy trenches and anti-aircraft guns have been fired at with machine guns from elevations of 500 to 800 feet.   One of our machines is missing.Mediter- In the Mediterranean the R.N.A.S. Station at Thermi, Mitylene, was persistentlyranean.      bombarded by enemy guns on the mainland, but there were no casualties and very littledamage was done.   The station was in process of transfer to Kalloni, 15 miles west bynorth from Thermi, and this transfer has now been completed.Two seaplanes attacked Chikaldare bridge (on the Bagdad railway five miles east of Missis and about 15 miles inland) and obtained several direct hits, but owing to the open construction of the bridge it is probable that most of the bombs passed through and exploded in the water.One seaplane started for Adana but did not return. *Red Sea. The Red Sea patrol force carried out a successful punitive expedition against Dubab(about 25 miles south of Mokha), the sloop &quot; Clio &quot; and her boats having recently been fired on from this place.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.The number of large enemy submarines believed to have been operating during the week is 21 to 24, most of which have heen working in the Atlantic. The areas of greatest activity have been in the Irish Sea and off the south coast of Ireland, probably due to the enemy seeking sheltered waters during heavy weather.The encounters with enemy submarines during the week have resulted in the probable destruction of one.The following&quot; Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Home Waters during recent weeks, and the nature of the craft which have engaged them : Nature of Craft.

The figures, however, are still much lower than for any of the weeks in August.The tonnage of Allied and Neutral Vessels lost this week also shows an increase.The table in Appendix II is a comparative Statement of all British Merchant Vessels sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the last two weeks by submarine and mine according to areas. It indicates that the British losses this week are almost entirely in Home Waters, and the Allied and Neutral losses in the Mediterranean.The table,in Appendix III shows by trades as regards British Merchant Steamships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine or mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last two weeks.Losses ofBritishsteamships.Areas in whichvessels lost.Losses in trades.ENEMY MINES.The losses by mine in Home Waters this week are two merchant ships.

The small number of mines destroyed in the last two weeks clearly points to reduced minelaying activities on the part of the enemy.The Minches and the North Channel are now clear of mines, and traffic is proceeding by normal routes. The sweeping forces available for these areas and Rathlin Sound, where enemy minelayihg has shown recent activity, are being reinforced.DEFENCE AGAINST SUBMARINE AND MINE.Convoy.Defensive armament.Offensive armament.Mine pro-tectiongear.During the week 743 ships have been convoyed as compared with 711 last week. Of the 743 ships convoyed, 349 were engaged in the French coal trade and 173 on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber route, the remaining 221 being engaged on overseas trade, 125 inward and 96 outward. There have been two losses in convoy this week, one a convoying vessel torpedoed and one a merchant vessel sunk by mine. Two other merchant ships have been sunk by submarine after separating from their convoy.During the week 35 additional merchant vessels were fitted for defensive armament, bringing the net number now fitted up to 3,339. The number of guns now available amounts to 3,024.The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered to date is 136.During the week 35 additional merchant ships have been fitted with Otter equipment, bringing the total number so fitted to 562. The number of warships now fitted with Paravane equipment is 284.MOVEMENTS OF GERMAN VESSELS.Six enemy merchant ships have this week arrived at Norwegian ports (outside the Cattegat), and five have left.   None have arrived at or left Rotterdam.There is no further news of the S.S. &quot; Wolf &quot; and S.V. &quot; Lutece,&quot; which are both believed to be still at large in the Southern Pacific.FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.Mutiny on Boaed German Men-of-WAr.The folloAving information has been obtained from the interrogation of prisoners of war: It appears that the first trouble occurred as early as May or June last in the 4th Battle Squadron, the principal cause of the mutiny being the insufficiency of the food supplied to the crews. Subsequently disciplinary conditions became considerably worse and matters came to a head towards the end of July.The crews of the vessels of the 4th Squadron consist largely of Reservists whose ieelings were exasperated on observing the elaborate dinners given by their officers, while the men&apos;s allowance was extremely meagre.A mutiny is reported to have broken out simultaneously on board the battleships &quot; Prinz Regent Luitpold,&quot; &quot;&apos;Kaiser,&quot; &quot; Kaiserin,&quot; &quot; Konig Albert,&quot; and the light cruisers &quot; Pillau &quot; and &quot; Regensburg &quot; which were lying in the Jade, and as the stokers refused to keep up steam the ships had to be towed up harbour.The leaven of discontent has spread also to the submarines, although conditions are not so bad in that branch of the service, the food allowance being more generous. A grievance, however, exists on account of the severe punishments dealt out for minor offences, and over certain restrictions in the granting of leave. It is stated, for example, that the commanding officer of U.C. 45 received a reprimand, on his return from his last trip, from the Flotilla Leader at Brunsbuttel for not having sunk any vessels. In annoy-ance at this he refused to give leave to his crew; they therefore left their boat without his permission and remained absent for about 24 hours. On their return all of them were told to proceed to sea forthwith, and informed that when they came back they would not Be given any leave but put under arrest for leave-breaking. The submarine in question is believed to have been lost immediately afterwards, the circumstances being somewhat of a mystery.In the opinion of the officers and the warrant officers examined, the mutiny was not of so serious a nature as indicated by Admiral von Capelle in his speech in theMerchant-men,Raiders.
\ -   ---- s%&apos; 5Reichstag, but the lower deck ratings are of opinion that the disturbances were in every respect as grave as described on that occasion.Uruguay.Diplomatic relations with Germany have now been severed, and ELM. Minister has telegraphed that the Neutrality Decrees were to be repealed on Monday, October 15th, in favour of all the Allies. The harbour of Montevideo has no gun defences, but is well sheltered by breakwaters, and the distance it lies up the estuary of the Plate makes an attack improbable. .mexico.Conditions generally in the country are again causing anxiety, except actually at the oilfields. With regard to the fuel oil supply it should be borne in mind that U.S.A. draws a large portion of her domestic supplies of the lighter oils from Mexico, and that interruption of the Mexican supply might restrict U.S. exports to us.Naval Staff,ISth October, 1917.[appendices.
