SECRE(Tl(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govemmentf7TRANSPORT   WORKERS    BATTALIONSMEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OP NATION/L SERVICE.In a former Memorandum (N, S , R , 12, &apos; G, T. 2045 ) dated 15th September,, I deprecated any extension of the system of militarily compelled labour, particularly in connection with Transport Workers Battalions;    and I pointed cut the unfortunate effect which such a form of labour has on labour generally,, by arousing suspicions of indirect industrial compulsion.This point is acutely emphasised in a letter which I have received from the Secretary of the National Transport Workers Federation, a copy of which is attached.A. C.  GEDDES,13-10.17.
TH2 NATIONAL TRANSPORT WORKERS1 FEDERATION, Trades Rail,220, Blackfriars Road,LONDON,; S.E....... October 10th 1917Sir Auckland Geddes,Director of Recruiting. Windsor Hotel, S;IV.  1.Sir,I have been directed to acquaint you of the following facts, as they will have an important bearing upon the subject-matter Of your various tasks now indicated to the public through press reports of your speeches.A man named P. Briggs, working at Newhaven as a docker, was called to the Colours on September 15th last, and was returned to his former occupation ten days later as a soldier and put on exactly the same class of work as he had vacated when called up for service.Another case is that of a waterside worker of Ipswich, whose exemption was cancelled by the Local Tribunal, and who was put to work -again at Newhaven Harbour- at civilian employment as a mlli--tary unit.I am informed, moreover, that amongst the soldiers at New-haven there are persistent efforts to reduce the number of men in a   -gang below that required for efficiency and safety.    The fact that the soldiers are working with a lesser number of men in a gang is being used to bring pressure to bear upon the civilian dockers in order to reduce the number in a gang belew that which for a long period has been deemed to be practical and necessary.At the last meeting of my Executive Council a resolution was considered at length to bring about a stoppage of work in all those ports where military labour is employed on civilian work until the military have been removedt     This my Executive could not accede to for reasons which will be obvious.     At the present time we have ex-treme difficulty in keeping our members in hand because of the irre-futable fact that men are being recruited ostensibly for military training and service, but are, without any military training at all, sent back to the self-same work from which they have been taken..A few months ago Mr. Harry Gosling, the President of the above Federation, and I, together with representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation and the National Union of Railwaymen, waited upon the Prime Minister regarding the possibility of w&apos;-at is, called industrial conscription.     The Prime Minister assured us that the Government had no intention of introducing, either directly or indirectly, a system of industrial consoription.     Fortunately or unfortunately, the work-ers in the various ports covered by our Federation are subscribing to the principle that the&apos; only effective means of bringing pressure to bear upon the various Government Departments is to take a short jfst from their customary occupations.     Only recently a serious Stoppage occurred at the port of Liverpool in order to ventilate the -demands of the seafaring members of our Federation for higher rates of^payment as compensation for war risks.     Although protracted ne-gotiations had been carried on by the Union officials, the employers and the Government showed no signs of making concessions until the men refused point-blank to proceed with their work and stopped thirty or forty of the big ocean-going vessels for periods varying from a couple of days to a week.
The circumstances of the convoy system now in operation to limit the toll taken by the enemy submarines are such as to impose an almost intolerable strain upon the labour facilities of the various ports to deal with the ships as they come in. If further calling-up is carried on by the recruiting authori-ties, it will increase this strain beyond the breaking-point. It may be all very well officially to bring in members of the Mobile Transport Battalion or other military to cope with the shortage of labour, but this will not satisfy our men, who look upon the recruiting activities which lead to men being called up and then reinstated in their former jobs under military discipline as a sign of the tendency of the Government to militarise as much labour as possible.I hope it will be possible for your Department to go fully into this matter as early as possible, and indicate to us a policy which will be likely to allay the suspicions -which we believe to be well founded- in the minds of our membership that the authorities are more anxious to drill and dragoon organised labour than they are successfully to prosecute the war.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    RObfCRT WILLIAMS.
