mm(YvK1MBVSMKBMy,- From Viceroy, Army Department, lStli October 1917.(Received at 11 p.m.)15440. Referring to our telegram of tbe 19th. ultimo, No. 14.121, and Marling&apos;s 329 F. of 4th October to London Foreign Office. Recent informa-tion points to Niedermayer&apos;s intention to lead his party into Persia, at an early date. Vide Maudes telegram X 4118, dated 10th October. We therefore press for very early action to meet imminent menace to our interests in Persia.2. We agree with&apos;Marling that it is essential to obtain friendship of Ministry there; he must of course be the best judge of suitability of Voosik-ed-Dowle.3. We think it very important fullest possible use should be made of South Persia Rifles. Nominal Commandant, as proposed in our previous telegram, might be vested in a Persian general.4. Provision of further British officers, as proposed in Marling&apos;s penultimate paragraphs, is not, within our powers.5. As regards his last paragraph you know our difficulties in regard to silver, and we should be very reluctant to have a fresh strain put upon us.
