I think this peper extremely sound.Capel tells me that he has discovered so many things against de Monzy and others that he is no longer anxious to work with them, but he is desirous of serving on the Committee which, ho suggests, should be formed in Paris.Capel tells me that French representatives in London are extremely opposed to the formation of a Committee in Paris which would, diminish their authority; he has proof that all the papers put op by the French Government asking for him to be employed in Paris were stopped at the French Embassy .Yours sincerely,- Signed) E.L. Spiers .Lt.-ColonelGeneral Staff .Major-General Sir G.M.W. Macdonogh, IL&apos;. CM.a -Director of -viilitar^ Intelligence, War Office,LONDON .&quot;&quot;2 - W   1ENCLOSURE.The opinion is held by a certain section of the French Government which does not believe in a complete military victory, that Germany can be brought to satisfactory terms by the threat of economic pressure after the War.This economic pressure consists in,the control of raw materials, - cotton, wheat , jute, oil-seed, etc. and by
- AntTolline the aocese to the- export markets of the world* -f^^e^^^Ti^ China, the Britieh^ol^nle^*toK6tC&apos;       The French idea ie that, if military operations came to P stand-still on the present fronts, the Allies could say to Germany &quot;Unless you. accept our terms, you cannot buy wheat, as all the wheat produced is controlled by a wheat erecutiYe in London;    you cannot buy cotton, except ^through the cotton executive in London;   you cannot ship your goods to^America, or China, except with a.licence which only the Allies can issue to you.     Therefore, unless you accept our terms, your economic life must come to a standstill. 1Whatever may be the value of this scheme for bringing about the end of the War, it seems certain that- it will be of importance at the time of peace negotiations.     Further, the opinion held by our French Allies and the activity they are showing in taking the initiative towards organising this control requires to be carefully studied, as regards the influence it may have on the peaoe negotiations and on the economic policy of the British Empire,First of all, it must be noted that in order to turn this idea into a practical scheme, four things are required1)     Credit... 2)     Ships.3)     The co-operation of the British Empire and America. (4)      Organisation.Of these four essentials, the French only possess the last and that at present only in a rudimentary state.     It is with&apos;British, ships, British credit and British colonial markets that the French propose to organise this economic pressure. :There is no objection to this, as apart from all sentimental reasons, it.is naturally in the interest of England to help France, as long as this policy does not prejudice the interests of the Dominions.Whatever .benefits arising from this control may be granted to. France, it appears essential that the control of a policy which wil]  so vitally affect the interest of the British Empire, should not pass into the hands of a French organisation and that the future policy of the Empire should not be fettered by a number of inter-departmental   agreements.The policy being followed at present by the group of French officials who are working at this ideaf both in London and Paris, is to conclude a number of separate agreements with the various Departments concerning imports, exports, purchasing executives, shipping, arrangements, etc., with a view to eventually building, up the machinery which will control tfce raw materials0There.is a danger - by allowing this, policy to defeelon through various departments without any central&quot; co-ordinal-fft -influence - that we may find, our hands tied when the processd?L^en,COmple^^     TMS may not ^-considered any great disadvantage and it may be in our Interest to allow France toSoSSB?rT CSntrGl 0f the raw materials.and to act as the honest broker between the British Empire and America at Presentttt &amp;!! 0J^cti0n migllt be Ye*y strong-at &quot;some later date wW the French Government may have changed and got into othlr&apos;hinds.seem elAy^IIIVT^        ^ heId on ^is question, it would f 1^closely this economic policy.   . In order to give some weight.&quot; -
to this &quot;bureau, all agreements made with British Departments should be submitted to it, so that their influence on our general policy could be checked.The French Government is not anxious to have such an organisation in Paris, as it prefers to-work direct with various Departments, in London, but could not very well refuse to allow it, as there is a French Commercial. Mission in London.The object of the British Commercial Mission in Paris would be to study and report upon the development of the inter-allied economic policy proposed by France and at the same time to ensure that on the ground of reciprocity, a fair treatment is given to British and Colonial interests in France. For this purpose,, it should group together in some, practical manner the existing elements^ viz., the Commercial Department of&apos; the Embassy,,the Consulates, the Committee of the British Chamber of Commerce and the Interparliamentary Economic Committee.With this machinery in existence the War Council could be kept directly informed of the developments of a policy, which will neces-sarily have a great influence on ihef uture relations between the British Empire and France.
