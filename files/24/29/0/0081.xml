PTiiis Document is the Property- of His Britannic Majesty s Gmment]Printed for the War Cabinet.   October 1917.SECRET. G.T.-2381.THE  LABOUR  SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 24th October, 1917.Part I: General Remarks.The effect of the abolition of Leaving Certificates is discussed. It seems clear that the commonly expressed anticipation of disastrous results was groundless, and that the stability of labour will be little affected. An attempt on the part of the employers to introduce a system of &quot; character notes &apos;&apos; is described.Part II: Press Opinions.The press agitation on the subject of the &quot; Times&apos; &quot; articles on &quot; The Ferment of Revolution &quot; has abated. Belated criticisms from the &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; and the &quot; Call &quot; are quoted.The subject of Conscription of Wealth is dealt with in a number of papers. An extract is given from the &apos;: Yorkshire Factory Times.&quot;Government control of coal is attacked in the &quot; Western Mail &apos;&apos; from the point of view of the coal owner. The increase in prices, consequent upon the rise in miners&apos; wages, is dealt with by the &quot;Herald,&quot; by &quot; Forward &quot; (which justifies it), and by the &quot; Labour News &quot; and the &quot; Clarion &quot; (which condemn it).The reorganisation of the Labour Party forms the subject of comment in the whole of the daily press. The Labour press has missed the importance of the proposed constitution.The &quot; Call &quot; attacks French socialism for its support of the Governments war policy.Criticisms of the Government Food Policy are quoted from various papers.Part III: District Reports.London is quiet, though there is discontent at Woolwich. In the West Midlands the state of affairs at Coventry gives rise to anxiety. In Yorkshire and East Midlands the situation is very satisfactory, except, perhaps, at Sheffield. Politics are an important topic of interest. In Lancashire an attempt is being made, both by the Shop Stewards and the official unions, to strengthen their positions.On the North-Easi Coast the position is on the whole quiet.In South Wales there is an important agitation among the moulders, and arrangements are being made for the ballot on the proposed comb out of miners. It is expected that the voting will be fairly even, but that in any event no strike is likely. The Clyde is not expected to cause any serious trouble until after the Committee on Production^ decision in the general wages application.Part IV: Strikes.The terms of settlement in the Oldham piecers&apos; strike are considered locally to be a victory for the strikers, and the prestige of the Control Board has received a serious blow.There have not, during the past week, been any really important strikes, though the total number reported by the Labour Statistics Department as having been in progress, namely 57, is high.Summary.[1100-1]B
Part V: DisputesThe report of the Shipyard Labour Department and the Ministry of Munitions indicate considerable unrest in the industries controlled by those Departments. In the coal-mining industry, and in the industries controlled by the War Office Contracts Department, the general situation appears to have improved somewhat.The Committee on production is to hear during the week the exceedingly important national application in regard to wages, put forward by the Unions connected with the shipbuilding, engineering, and metal trades.I. General Remarks.The Abolition of the Leaving Certificate.Reports have been received from various sources which indicate that the anxiety undoubtedly felt in many quarters by employers as to the immediate effect of the abolition of the Leaving Certificate has had little justification in the facts. It is premature to make a definite statement as to the displacement which has resulted, and will result, from the new arrangements, but it may be said with confidence that any important dislocation of work is exceedingly unlikely.The Ministry of Labour has obtained from all employment exchanges state-ments of the number of forms received during the weeks ending the 12th October and the 19th October, from workpeople desiring to change their employment. In the former week 36 persons engaged on admiralty work, and 221 otherwise engaged submitted those forms. In the latter week, in the course of which the certificate was abolished, the numbers rose only to 116 and .376 respectively. Reports received from all divisional officers are unanimous in stating that no movements of labour on a large scale are in progress, and that the employers do not now regard the situation as in .any way serious.The Shipyard Labour Department reports from the Clyde that, up to the night sof the 18th October, 788 men out of 56,000 employed in the shipyards, and 953 out of 50,000 in the engineering shops had availed themselves of their liberty of action, while from another reliable source, the total number of removals up to the 21st October may be placed at 2,000 in that area.The Army Contracts Departmental Report states, with regard to the Sheffield area, that no fear of any widespread desire for change need be entertained; the Ministry of Munitions confirms this view from the Manchester area. In the Tyne district there has been no appreciable movement, and the large firms, such as Armstrong Whitworth, and Palmers&apos; Shipbuilding Company, have found no difficulty in retaining their staffs.The reasons given for the stability of labour under changed conditions are various. The chief of them appear to be, first, a disinclination to sacrifice good wages, second, anticipation of conscription in case of continued unemployment, and third, in certain areas, action by employers themselves.The third reason is one which may possibly give rise to trouble. It has been reported from more than one quarter that employers are arranging to protect them-selves from the employment of agitators, or other undesirable workmen, by demanding a &quot; character note &quot; from the applicant, and that they refuse to engage any man seeking work unless he has supplied himself with such a note from his last employer. The men are stated to object very strongly to this system, which practically requires the production of an unofficial leaving certificate, and if it is really persisted in by employers, trouble will result.On the other hand, the abolition of the leaving certificate is being -exploited by certain mechanics employed in motor radiator manufacture at Coventry. They have demanded a rate of 2s. an hour, and have accompanied the demand by a threat to transfer their services to aeroplane factories which pay this rate, if their demands are not conceded.II. Press Opinions.&quot; The Ferment of Revolution.&quot;The agitation produced by the &quot; Times &quot; articles is subsiding, and those articles are the subject of specific reference in only two of the Labour papers received during the week.    The &quot;Leicester Pioneer&quot; prints &quot; A Defence of the
Workers,&quot; which suggests that the articles in the &quot; Times &quot; were part of a deliberate intrigue to arouse popular indignation against pacifist socialism, and may be regarded as a symptom of the anxiety which the capitalist class feels in regard of the present position and the future, when the armies will return from the front.In the &quot; Call,&quot; Dora Montefiore looks upon the articles as an attempt to drive a wedge between &quot; the intellectually inclined young men and women of the well-paid wage-earning class&quot; and the textile workers, agricultural labourers, and unskilled workers.The &quot;Times &quot; statement of the revolutionary method, &quot; Demand upon demand, strike upon strike, blow upon blow, until the Capitalist State is destroyed,&quot; is welcomed.  &quot; We thank thee, Northcliffe, for giving us this phrase.&quot;The Conscription of Wealth.The question of serious taxation of capital is receiving a large amount of attention, and is the subject of much ill-informed comment. In many quarters it appears to be regarded as an alternative to the conscription of men for the military forces. The &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; publishes the report prepared on this subject by a sub-committee of the Workers&apos; War Emergency Committee. The following is an extract: &quot; That in view of the fact that the Government has not shrunk from compulsory conscription of men, the Committee protests most strongly against any further borrowing at interest of capital to maintain the war; . . . . That for all the future money required to carry on the war, the Government ought, in common fairness, to balance the conscription of men by the conscription of wealth; that a suitable measure would be the immediate imposition in lieu of the threatened loan, of a graduated tax on all capital wealth on the lines of the existing death duties.&quot;The paper recommends trade unions, working men&apos;s clubs, co-operative societies, and trade councils to support these proposals at once by resolutions, copies of which should be submitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Government Control: Coal.The &quot; Western Mail&quot; publishes a trenchant criticism of the policy of the Coal Controller, whom it accuses of failure to consult expert managers in important matters of policy.   Speaking of control generally the paper says : &quot; The only people apparently, who do not appreciate the drawbacks are those who are entrusted with experiments in State control.&quot;The increase in the pit&apos;s mouth price of coal is generally criticised. The &quot; Herald &quot; says :-&quot; Whether the increase of 2s. 6d. per ton is justified or not by the increase of wages granted the mine workers is a question which can only be satisfactorily answered by those acquainted with the industry.&quot;&quot; Forward &quot; dealing with the same subject writes : &quot; The colliers having got an increase in wages, the coal owners immediately increase the cost of coal by the sum of the miners&apos; rise, and the general public goes about cursing the rapacity of the colliers. It may be convenient to remind the aforesaid public that, at the outbreak of war, the miners offered to refrain from asking increases during the war, if the Government would prevent the coal, money and food exploiters from raising the cost of living.&quot;Other papers regard the action of the miners with disfavour, and suggest that they are exploiting the community. The &quot; Labour News &quot; points out that the South Wales miners were already earning an average of 14s. l\d. per day before the recent advance, and says : &quot;These wages cannot be construed as poor, and householders in Cardiff, who are com-pelled to pay at least 38s. per ton for their coal, view with alarm the still higher prices that are to be imposed.&quot;&quot; Clarion &quot; writes : &quot; Now we have two lots of profiteers in the mining industry. The owners and the wage-earners.   Such is the result of the glorious gospel of competition and grab.&quot;
Government Control: Shipping.Referring to the representations made by the shipbuilders against a proposal that the Government should continue control for a period of two years, instead of six months, after the war, the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; writes: &quot;So it seems that control, even limited control, by the Government, is not to be submitted to without a struggle; what about control by the workers, then? Wake up, Labour.The Reorganisation of the Labour Party.The draft constitution of the Labour Party, adopted by the National Executive on the 18th October, which will be submitted next January to the Conference of the Party, is a document the importance of which is more accurately diagnosed by the daily than by the Labour press. It is generally agreed that the proposals which it embodies tend to strengthen the Labour Party materially.The &quot; New Statesman &quot; writes : &apos;&apos; If this constitution commends itself to the Party Conference&apos; meeting at Nottingham next January, the way will be clear for a great expansion of the Labour Party from its present rather narrow limits into a wide and genuinely national political organisation.&quot;The Labour papers appear to have entirely failed to grasp the significance of the new principle. The &quot;Labour Leader &quot; is only concerned with the effect on the Independent Labour Party of the proposal for individual membership : While this reform would tend to broaden the basis and outlook of the Labour Party, it is one which also concerns the Independent Labour Party, and requires careful considera-tion. Both Messrs. MacDonald and Snowden favour the proposal, which was advocated by them orginally.&quot;The &quot; Leicester Pioneer &quot; tacks on to a rambling article, a justification of &quot; revolutionary&quot; spirit: Any movement that lacks your eager and fiery minds who desire to see speedy methods of emancipation is not worth considering. Often the presence of these impulsive persons proves that a movement has not lost its soul.&quot;The &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; also misses the point: &quot; The proposal to have an organisation on a basis of individual membership will seriously affect the Socialist organisations. The scheme will require very careful consideration before it is adopted.&quot;Internationalism and the* French Socialist Congress.The proceedings and decisions of the Socialist Conference at Bordeaux have proved a very severe disappointment to the more extreme Socialist papers. The &quot; Call &quot; in an article headed &quot;The Bordeaux Disgrace &quot; is specially bitter. It says: &quot;The utter inability of the Minority to formulate a clear conception of the present Imperialist war . . . . leaves no hope for the recovery of French Socialism in the near future, and, therefore, for the early restoration of the International.&quot;The &quot; Yorkshire Factory Times &quot; protests against Mr. Appleton&apos;s letter to the International Conference at Berne.   It writes : We ask the general public not to take any notice of the document sent by Mr. Appleton, as it does not represent the Trades Union Congress, nor does it represent the Trades Union movement as a whole.&quot;Food.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; considers that if the war is to continue into next year, and if famine is to be averted, the sooner the Food Controller resorts to some equitable system of rationing, the better.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times &quot; protests against the rise in the price of milk :- &quot; The price charged for milk in many districts is a scandal.   Farmers are to be foundwho will confess that they are able to make a satisfactory profit at the old prices.....In general, farmers are simply &apos; on the make &apos; and require firm handling by the Committee.&quot;Referring to the shortage of tea. the &quot;Clarion&quot; writes : &quot; If there are to be shortages, and there must be, the food will have to be rationed.&quot;
The &quot; Herald &quot; asks how famine was made certain, and replies : &quot; Because it was not to the interest of the landowning, shipowning, profiteering, parasitical classes and their political tools, who were paid by the nation, that the people should be fed with home-grown produce. . . . . The men responsible for the coming famine are Asquith . . . . Lloyd George .... and Co., the political agents of the profiteers. . . . :. It is essential to make a clean sweep of the whole monstrous slave driving system after the peace.&quot;the &quot;Leicester Pioneer &quot; thinks that Lord Rhondda and Sir Arthur Yapp are succeeding in their endeavours to ensure economy in the use of food.III. District Reports.London and South-East.The situation in this area is normal.The political developments of the last week have attracted considerable attention, particularly the Labour Party&apos;s proposals for extending its membership and scope of action. Arrangements are being made to forward the candidature of Labour nominees in many of the London districts, and at Woolwich it has been decided to nominate two candidates.The men at Woolwich are somewhat restless and discontented with the arrange-ments which have been made by the Ministry of Munitions in connection with the withdrawal of leaving certificates, particularly the rules as to leaving skilled work and munitions work. More serious is the discontent among the highly skilled men with the 12^ per cent, rise which has been granted to them.&apos; They are said to have expected at least 25 per&apos; cent., and several of the men in the gauge room are reported to be leaving.It is expected that an agitation will be started among the semi-skilled men for the rise to be extended to themselves,South-West. . .With the exception of local discontent in some quarters the situation is quiet.West Midlands.Conditions are normal, though at Coventry there is a considerable degree of unrest. Much discontent was caused by the action of the Belgian Government in carrying off certain workmen for the army. No sooner had this trouble been settled than the Amalgamated Society of Engineers at Foleshill arranged a protest meeting against the discharge of seventy-five men from the Coventry Ordnance Works, and the retention of a number of Belgians in their place.In addition a rumour as to the introduction of Chinese labour into Coventry which has recently been going the rounds is a further and important cause of unrest.At Birmingham the National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors and its offshoot, thje National Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors and War Pensioners, both appear to be in very low water. The founder of the former is said to have applied for readmittance to the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilised Sailors and Soldiers, a much more important body. This latter federation is reported to be not without its internal desensions, though as things at present stand.it is still by far the most powerful body of its kind in the country.Yorkshire and East Midlands.The situation throughout this district is described as much improved, Sheffield being probably the one district where uneasiness prevails.An important meeting of the Natiorial Union of Railwaymen was held at Grantham on Saturday last. The grievances discussed were chiefly those of the members employed by the Great Northern Railway, but Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P. made an important statement as to the policy which he believed ought to be pursued. He thought that strikes should only be resorted to in the last extremity, and that no advantage ought to be taken of war conditions to put forward claims. This speech appears to have had a very moderating effect on the feeling of the meeting.In Yorkshire an attempt is being made to revive the agitation in regard to
food prices. This has been particularly the case in Leeds and Sheffield, but so far its effect has not been important. Sugar and tea are apparently the two articles of food which are causing most trouble.Intense interest is displayed in the new constitution of the Labour Party, and there is great enthusiasm for an ambitious effort at the next general election, which it is believed locally will not be far distant. In this district the co-operative societies are particularly strong, and it is thought that the two parties between them will contest every industrial constituency in the district.North-Western.Conditions are normal in the North-West. There are a number of strikes and disputes in progress, but none of these are of any particular importance.On the 15th October the Mersey Trades Federation held an important meeting, at which a proposal to form workshop committees was approved. This meeting appears to have been organised with a view to giving a counterblast to the activities of the shop stewards and other extremists. It was attended by most of the responsible leaders in the district, and its decisions, which appear to be virtually an acceptance of the proposals contained in the Whitley Report, must be regarded as very satisfactory.Since then there has been issued from Manchester, but apparently as repre-senting the Shop Stewards&apos; Movement as a whole, a circular containing proposals for the organisation and future operations of that movement. Attention is par-ticularly drawn to the need for great unity of effort.The 12-1 per cent, advance to skilled men has caused much grumbling in Man-chester. In Liverpool, on the other hand, attention appears to be concentrated on the apparently subsidiary points, when the award is to come into operation and what classes of workers are to benefit by it.At Barrow there has been trouble between the foremen and the new class for forewomen. The matter has been settled in favour of the former, and the shop stewards claim to be responsible for the success, having offered their support to the foremen, even to the length of a stoppage of work. Food prices have also been a topic of much discussion at Barrow, the local impression being that conditions are much worse there than in other towns.The whole of this district is displaying an almost feverish interest in the appli-cation for a general increase now before the Committee on Production.Northern.There is still unrest among the workers in the shipj^ards, but conditions are otherwise normal.At Wallsend there is the possibility of a serious dispute between the rivetters and the North East Marine Engineering Co. The firm is insisting that men formerly employed at time rates should go on piece work, and a number have already been dismissed, chiefly men who are over military age.Wales.Considerable unrest continues to be a feature of-the South Wales Coalfield, and has spread during the past few weeks to many of the metal workers and others employed in the shipyards. The moulders throughout South Wales are demanding an immediate increase of 12-1 Per cent, in wages, and, in conjunction with engineers, labourers, and others, have commenced an agitation to begin work daily at 7 a.m, instead of 6 a.m. This is already the practice in certain of the docks, and there is reason to believe that the employers are on the whole inclined to favour the proposal.The question of the recruitment of miners, which was referred to in last week&apos;s report, is the most important matter engaging the attention of the people in South Wales at the moment.There is reason to believe that the conference of delegates which rejected the proposed comb-out is by no means representative; and that the ballot on the subject which is to take place on the 1st and 2nd November, will show that opinion is much more evenly divided than the voting at that conference might indicate.The executive of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation has given the men a clear lead against the proposals of the conference. Mass meetings of protest against the pacifist policy have been held at Ystrad Mynach, Mountain Ash, Pentre, Ebbw Tale, and other places.\
Scotland.There is discontent in various parts of ^Scotland, but, as far as the Clyde is concerned, it is not considered likely that any extreme action will be taken before the Committee on Production issues its general award.A ballot has been taken among the ironmoulders on a proposal to give strike pay to those men who were concerned in the recent strike, and resulted in an affirm-ation vote.There is a considerable degree of distress among the miners in Fifeshire, who for a considerable time past have had little or no work to do. An attempt is to be made to transfer them to other districts.IV. Strikes.It is now possible to give the main features of the settlement arrived at in the case of the Lancashire cotton piecers, referred to in the last two numbers of this report.The local joint agreement regarding suspended labour in the spinning rooms is to stand and the order of the Control Board to be adhered to. In mills where the employers and men have reached an agreement as to staffing, that practice is to continue. In mills where no such agreement has been effected work is to continue under the conditions existing prior to the 5th October, but every effort is to be made to arrive at an agreement.Wages withheld during the stoppages are to be paid and all summonses with-drawn.   There must be no victimisation of strikers.There was a good deal of opposition to returning to work among the piecers. This is rather curious in view of the fact that the Cotton Control Board is regarded locally as having given way. The &quot; Manchester Guardian &quot; devoted a leading article to the subject, deploring the weakness which the Control Board had shown in the matter, and expressing the opinion that chaos would result. The &quot; Cotton Factory Times,&quot; which can probably be taken as representing the opinion of the older and more thoughtful section of the workers, in its edition previous to the settlement, expressed the opinion that the strike was factious and advised the Control Board to adopt a strong line. Its tone in the last number is distinctly hostile to the Board, which has so far received its support.On the whole it would appear unfortunate that the Board, having decided that the welfare of the industry called for a certain line of policy, should have withdrawn from its position on meeting the first serious opposition. Its conduct was no doubt partly due to the fact that the local interests in the industry are almost entirely hostile to its operations.At Derby 8,000 employees of the Midland Railway works went on strike on the 24th. October, owing to a dispute between the Boilermakers and the National Union of Railwaymen, as to which union should enrol boilermakers engaged in the railway shops.   Full details are not yet available.An important strike of steelworkers occurred at Dowlais on the 17th. The trouble arose out of an application for an advance in wages put forward by the Workers&apos; Union. Arbitration was agreed upon, but the Union insisted on having the case heard locally, and during the consequent delay the men stopped work. The enginemen and boilermen, who had given their word to remain at work until their official had had an interview with the Chief Industrial Commissioner, went back on it and came out on the 19th.. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers followed on a trivial pretext, and finally the members of the National Union of General Workers, who&quot; were at the time in negotiation with the firm on a wages matter, came out also.This series of stoppages, probably due more to strain than anything else, did not last long, the men returning on the 22nd, with the proviso that the arbitrator must arrive before the 25th, failing which they will come out on the 27th.A strike involving 2,300 machinists took place at the Belsize Motors, Ltd. (Manchester), on the 15th October, and was settled on the following day.A further strike, involving 1,100 fitters at Messrs. Fodens,  Ltd.   (Sandbach),   is  an interesting example of the extreme triviality of many of the pretexts which are adopted as reasons for striking.   The question at issue was whether a foreman had sworn at a machinist&apos; or at his machine.   Eventually his word was taken that the latter had been the object of his wrath.
In the coal-mining industry there are still some half-dozen strikes in progress.In Leicestershire some sort of an arrangement has been come to with the members of the Amalgamated Union of Firemen, who have been idle for ten days in consequence of the refusal of the Notts and Derbyshire Enginemen&apos;s Union to comply with an award of the Trades Union Congress. Pressure has been brought to bear on the members of the latter union by the Coal Controller, and it is hoped that they will gradually leave their union and become members of the Amalgamated Union. The men who have been on strikei returned to work on the 22nd on day contracts, pending the completion of the process of transference. If in sis weeks the Notts and Derbyshire men have not all joined the Amalgamated Union they threaten to strike once more.The position in the Ulster linen industry is still unsatisfactory. The employers are refusing to carry out the award, and it will be necessary to compel them to do so, if the principle.of arbitration is to be ,upheld. On the 14th October a distress fund&apos; was established on behalf of the weavers and others who are unemployed in consequence of the dispute.V. Disputes.The Committee on Production, during the past weeK, heard 25 cases 17 in London and 8 in Scotland. Two cases involving many thousands of employees were heard on the 18th October, when applications for an increased war bonus were put forward on behalf of the employees of three London tramway companies, and also on behalf of employees of the London General Omnibus Company.Another case heard affects all the blast-furnacemen employed in South Stafford-shire.During the present week the Committee is to hear the important general claims made under the agreement for the periodical review of wages in the engineering and foundry trades. A threatening manifesto has been published on behalf of a number of the men concerned, and it is also understood that the employers&apos; federa-tions have made a counter application for a reduction of the present rate, on the ground that the cost of food has decreased since the date of the last award. The Committee on Production is at the.moment the chief centre of interest for a very large section of labour.The number of cases of dispute reported by the Shipyard Labour Department remains at the high figure of 174. The great majority of such cases are concerned with wages, and do not involve very serious consequences. Ten of them have, however, led to stoppages of work during the week, while 43 have been settled. The situation on the Clyde would appear to be somewhat better, though there were still as many as 101 disputes in progress.Several of the more important cases arose out of refusals on the part of the men to accept awards, and in one case out of a similar refusal on the part of the firm.At Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s, at Dalmuir, a stoppage arose out of a demarcation dispute between the plumbers and certain women employed on acetylene welding. The officials of the Shipyard Labour Department met with difficulty owing to the obduracy of the men, who refused to allow their union to-deal with the case or to refer it to arbitration, on the ground that their officials had let them down on previous occasions. Eventually they agreed to return to work.In the coal-mining industry the situation in South Wales continues to be serious. The question of the recruiting of miners is dealt with in Section III. Arising out of a small strike at the Llandebie Colliery in Glamorganshire, due to an accusation against the honesty of a weigher, an attempt is being made to bring out all the miners in the anthracite district. A parallel effort is being made by the men in the Dowlais Valley, as a protest against the handing of notices to a number of men, which has been necessitated by lack of tonnage. It is not, however, thought probable that either of these movements will succeed.Two out of the eight cases reported by the War Office Contracts Department have originated during the past week. In one case the point at issue is the employment of non-unionists, and in the other the alleged refusal on the part of the firm to comply with an arbitration award.The position generally in the clothing trade is quiet, but there is some unrest among the leather and jute industries. The important wages claim put forward by various unions in the woollen industry is under consideration.The Ministry of Munitions reports 22 cases of disputes, leading in eight cases to stoppages of work (several of these are referred to in more detail in Section IV). All these strikes have, however, come to an end, and in two other cases the dispute has been settled. Two of the 12 remaining cases are wages disputes between corporations and their employees, and two others have arisen in aircraft works. An interesting case is reported from South Wales, where the workmen in five spelter works have given notice that they ,will do no more Sunday work unles? they are relieved of the obligation to pay income tax on such work.D.
