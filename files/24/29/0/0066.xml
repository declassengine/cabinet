Prom:   Llilitary Attache.Petrograd, 17th October, 1917.No. 1415.General Golyevski, late military attache, Washington, is to be appointed 2nd General Quartermaster at Petrograd, in order to superintend the services of intelligence and counter espionage.After the fall of Riga it was proposed t* commence the evacuation from Petrograd of some of the more important factories.     However, the workmen put forward demands for personal compensation Buch as the Government was unable tt meet and no factory has been moved yet.     The Town Council has new posted proclamations concerning the precautions to be taken in cases of aircraft raids, and evacuation may be hastened by these,A general lock-out is now considered improbable. Practically all factories are working for Government and pricey, fcave been raised in some instances covering the workmens demands.     In other cases manufacturers are continuing to work at a loss for they know their works will be burnt down if they attempt to close them.Workmen try to do the minimum of work,     For example^ works at Tver&quot;1&quot; which before the Revolution produced 600 wagons a manth, ,turned out nothing in March and April, 40 tcs 50 in May and June and then advanced to 170, but they are declining again,$ The Minister cf   ar is confident that he will restore the army by Spring,     He thinks that he will be able to feed it through the winter and supply warm clothing but he is doubtful about boots.     Officers from the front state that the men are only receiving one pouriid(one group undecipherable) of bread daily whereas they like 3,    Many of them have gambled away their boots and greatcoats.The Classes of 1895 and 1896 were dismissed on the 14th October, those of 1897 and 1890 will go on the 28th October and that of 1899 on the 1.4th November.     It is estimated that the strength of those 5*classes is 1,000,000,/TVerkhovski is anxious to start peace propaganda in enemy countries but I pointed out that this task is not so easy in other countries as in Russia.   He thinks we should also offer Germany ouch terms of peace as she will refuse in order to show the Russian soldier why he is fighting.   I told him I thought this a very dangerous experiment as I could not suggest any reservation the German Government might make that the Russian sol6*ier .in his present frame of mind would consider work fighting for.

Savinkov.   The latter has definitely quarrelled with Kerenski and is inscribing himself as a Cossack.   He has bought one of the daily papers with funds subscribed by Cadets and social revolutionaries.     The general opinion is that Kerenski will not dare to bring Korniloff to trial as he fears dimensions of rovelations./   Gen, Verkhoveki is Miniate? of War.*   The age of the men belonging to these five classes is as under.Class 1895 - age 43 ,,    1896-        42 1097-        41 ,,    1898 -        40 1899 - 39
