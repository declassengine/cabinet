Thii $tcument it the Property off His Britannic Majesty^ Government.uAH CABINET.AT.2346. SOLDIERS&apos; PEPSN.DMTS,Memorandum by&apos;the Rt* Hon.. ft.J,.B&amp;rnes. M.P. (See *&apos;ar Cabinet 232(8) and 235 (12).)It will be remembered that the attention of the %r Cabinet was directed to a report in the &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; of alleged hardship to wives and dependants of soldiers during the period in which such wives and dependants were being institutionally treated, by stoppage of allowance by the r/ar Office and Admiralty, (*.C. 232(8) ).   The question was also involved of the Poor Law Authorities having made claims for re-imbursement on the plea that pensions and al-lowances were properly a national and not a local charge.By War Cabinet 235, Minute 12, the Mnister of Pensions was directed to convene a committee consisting of renres-entatives of the Departments concerned, with a view to the presentation of a report,   this has been done:   two meetings have been held, at which the Admiralty, -*ar Office, Treasury, Local Government Board and Pensions lanistry were represented The whole matter has been considered, and recommendations made;   and it is stated in a letter I have received from the Pensions Ministry that &quot;If the War Cabinet so direct, action vill forthwith be taken on the report,hThe committee appear to have come to the conclusion that there lag no serious deficiency of accommodation for the Institutional treatment of dependants of soldiers or sailors or pensioners.   It is recommended that the existing systeit of the stoppage of separation allowance during treatment in a rate-aided institution should be modified so as to provid*S&apos;A, For the continuance at the usual rate of the sep-aration allowance, notwithstanding the admission to such an institution of a dependant other than a sol-dier or soldier1s wife.B. For the payment by the Local &apos;.ar Pensions Committee subject to conditions, of an allowance in lieu of, but&quot; at the same rate as separation allowance during, the institutional treatment of soldiers&apos; or sailors wives.C. The existing system of administration of pensions during treatment In a rate-aided institution should be modified so far as to provide for the suspension of payment of pension to a soldiers1 wido*, subject to the condition that an allowance of equal amount should be administered by the Local War Pensions Committee for her benefit.
lb tG. H, B,20th. October, 1917.These recommendations really mean that the War Office and Admiralty continue to pay, but that the Local War Pen-sions Committee, should receive the money, it being impos-sible for the wife to receive it when she is laid up in an institution and therefore unable to go to the Post Office and sign for it.   !*&apos;he conditions referred to are that the Local Poor Law Authority should be left to take their own course and exercise right of recovery if they care to do so.The committee further took note of the fact that the Banister of Penions had contemplated bringing forward a claim for the medical treatment of the widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors on the plan of a compulsory contribution out of the pension.   (In explanation of this, I amy say that the provision in question is a stoppage of Id. per 2/6d. out of the pension, to cover cost of&quot;medical attendance,)   This v.-as strongly urged upon the Penions Ministry at the time of dr&amp;v/mg up the warrant, because there were many cases of sickness amongst raaen and children which could not be borne out of the slender pensions and al-lowances.   Immediately afterwards, however, the question of a Ministry of Health began to be discussed and has been discussed ever since, but has not fructified.   The Ministry of Pensions, however, has suspended taking action in regard to the exercise of the power under the  arrant, because of this discussion of a possible Health Ministry.The v,ar Cabinet is asked to give authority for action to be taken in accordance with the recommendations of the cosimittee.
