War Cabinet.  ,--. The Portuguese Contingent. ITote by the Secretary of State for War.With reference to W.C..104 (13) and G.T. 210, I think the War Cabinet should see the attached reply from Major General Barnardiston to the telegram-of a temporising but conciliatory character which I was requested to send..There is no change for the better with regard to shipping since the decision was reached, but I should like the War Cabinet instructionsas to what answer should be given to Major General Barnardiston&apos;s telegram,.18.4.17.
From the Secretary of State to Majors-General Barnardiston.2nd April,. 1917.&quot;32028 cipher.Your. 141 of .23rd February and in continuation of War Office telegram 30085 of 26th February.     Please express His Majesty&apos;s Governmentrs sincere regret that, at the present moment-, we are&apos;unable to provide shipping for transportation to France of additional troops necessary to raise Portuguese force to an Army Gorps0His Majesty,&apos;s Government greatly appreciate effort of Portuguese, and immediate acceptance of offer is only prevented by military needs for transport elsewhere.At a.&quot;later date efforts to provide necessary transport Y/ill be made, and further communication will.be addressed to you-, I rely on you to assure Portuguese Government of the Governmentls genuine appreciation of their offer.Your 138 of 19th February..     Y/ith reference to Heavy Artillery Corps further communication will be sent you.
From:u Major General Barnardiston, to the War Office.12/4/17.No. 213, .Reference 32020 cipher April 3rd from S, of S.    I am told hy iiinister of War that decision to defer indefinitely acceptance of additional troops seriously embarasses him, as he has already taken measures to furnish them which is very difficult to countermand.,     Portuguese Government are making representation through British Minister which gives incorrect impression that pressure has &quot;been brought upon them to furnish 2nd division, I am writing on this.    But it should &quot;be remembered that Minister of War stated at outset of negotiations his intention was to send 2nd. Division, and I was instructed in Hovember to enquire probability of its being ready.      Hence Minister of War&apos;s proposals telegraphed you February 2ord, &quot;&apos;  Means of transport appear to be the sole difficulty,     I have consulted Naval transport officer who agrees that counting on Portuguese assistance.original force can be conveyed in 2 next trips, except perhaps horses, and additional troops could be transported in 2 extra trips say by beginning of August plus&apos; one or perhaps 2 additional trips Bohemian for horses on assumption that latter ship will.&quot;be retained permanently for reinforcements which will &apos;amount later on to about 4,000 per month.    - Can Admiralty he induced to.consent?. Possibly some shipping may have been released by entry of American States.     -If possible acceptance of Portuguese proposals very desirable.
