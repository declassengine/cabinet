Circulated to the King.V/ar ,,Caj:j.ngt and Members of the Imperial Conference.Memorandum .on Greece,In a memorandum which was circulated to the Cabinet on the 6th March last it was indicated that the main difficulties with which His Majesty&apos;s Government were faced in dealing with the situation in Greece could he grouped under three headings; viz., difficulties connected with the Allied ultimatum on January 8th, difficulties which had since arisen between His Majes-ty&apos;s Government and the French Government, and diffi-culties inherent in the internal condition of Greece,Since that date the above difficulties have been accentuated and developed, and it may be ad-vantageous to summarise the problems which have since arisen and on which a decision would now appear to be required.(1)   It should in the first instance be observed that during tne last four weeks three political events of capital importance have occurred, one of which has a direct, and two an indirect, effect upon the situation in Greece.   The first is the fall of the Briand Cabinet on Marc&amp; 18th;&apos;  the otner two are the Russian Revolution and the accession of the United States to the cause of the Allies,These latter two events have, it is true, pro-due ed
produced but an indirect influence upon the Greek situation, hut this influence, for what it is worth, has been entirely in the direction of strengthening tne democratic forces under Monsieur Venizelos as against the -militarist regime of King Constantine. Thus on the one hand these two events have fortified trie policy of those who desire to support, even at the risk of sane inconvenience, the democratic elements in Greece; on the other hand, they have weakened the practical effect of the enemy-inspired criticism that the Allies are behaving in Greece even as the Germans behaved in Belgium.Uhile, therefore, the above two events have re-acted but indirectly, though effectively, upon the Greek question, tne fall of Monsieur Briand, or more properly the accession to power of the Ribot Cabinet, has produced a very immediate effect the consequences of which have been to raise the Greek question from a purely local problem to the status of one of the main assets in French Mediterranean policy.Monsieur Briand had been attacked in the Press, in the Chamber, and by the Committee of Foreign Affairs for his alleged leniency towards the Royalist element in Greece, and Monsieur Ribot is indubitably determined that the policy of the new Government shall in any case not err upon the&apos; side of sympathy towards the Government of Athens.   This new policy will have the active supportof
of French public opinion arid of the French Colonial Party and General Sarrail and the French Admiral have already been instructed to &quot;prepare in secret for such measures as may be necessary to protect the lives of Venizelists in Greece and of Allied subjects and citizens&quot;.   It is true that a rider nas been added to these instructions to the effect that no action is to be &apos;,aken without reference to Paris, yet it is obvious that this somewhat vague commission will be exploited by General Sarrail and his innumerable officers and agents in Greece to the utmost of its capacity.(2)   a minor difficulty has also arisen in regard to the interpretation of the clause in the Allied ultim-atum of January ath by which the Allied Powers undertook not to allow the withdrawal of the Greek troops to the Morea to be made the occasion of the extension of the Venizelist movement by land or sea.   Since this under-taking was given we nave been faced by the problem of spontaneous Venizelist risings in certain Greek islands and by the necessity in which we are morally placed of preventing the At.iens Government from employing force to suppress these risings.   Our refusal to allow the em-ployment of such force by the Athenian Government has been interpreted by the latter as a violation of the undertaking of January 8th, and a nrotest has been ad-dressed to the Allied Powers which has hitherto remained unansweredoThis
This second problem is important, as showing the anomaly of the present situation and the illogical, if not undignified, position in which the Allied Powers are placed between their moral responsibility to the Venezelists and their contractual undertakings to the Government of Athensr(3)    A third factor which has of late been emphasised is the affect which the Allied Blockade is having upon Royalist Greece,    There is no doubt that the Blockade, While increasing our unpopularity in some quarters, and while increasing tho danger of atrocities on the part of the reservists, has created a widespread feeling of dissatisfaction against the Gov-eminent of Athens of which the Venezelists are increas-ingly, and admittedly, desirous of taking advantagetIt may be said, therefore, that the present situa-tion can be summed up under three heads:-(1)    The determination of the present French Cabinet to pursue an active, and by implication an anti-Royalist, policy in Greece, - a policy, in the pursuance of which the dominant position of General Sarrail and the French Admiral Commanding-in-chief, will give them every advantager(2)    The anomaly, in present circumstances, of the continued maintenanco of the undertakings given in the ultimatum of January Oth0(3)     The increasing effervoscence in Old Greece, which may at any moment provide the Venezelists with a
cause lor further outbreaks, and the French with an oc-casion for definite intervention,,     It should he remen-bered, moreover, that this intervention, if it comes, will have for its object the establishment of French control over the whole of Greece*To the above three elements in the situation there might, perhaps, be added a fourth factor;   namely, that the French Government are now in possession of airple &quot;causes of complaint&quot; such as might be held to justify them, not only in repudiating the engagements given in the ultimatum of January 8th. but in undertak-ing active measures of hostility against the Government of Athens *    Such &quot;causes of complaint&quot; would be the delay on the part of the Greek Government in executing the Allied demands of January 8th* (a delay which is incidentally largely due to the obstruction of the French themselves)? and the alleged discoveries of dap6ts of arms and ammunition in Thessaly^From our own point of view the above problems appear to resolve themselves into tho following con-siderations(1)    Whether, supposing that the maintenance of our status quo in Greece, and the observance of our obligations to the Government of Athens, is no linger sither possible or desirable, His Majesty&apos;s Government should allow the French Government alone to initiate and to carry out whatever measures may be necessary tosecure
secure a radical solution of the Greek question(2)   -Whether if it is preferred not to raise the question at the present moment, and the French then present us, as on previous occasions, with a- fait aceon-&apos; pll of French intervention in Greece we should, after the event, risk a serious conflict with them in order to prevent the gradual establishment of what will in ef* feet become a French protectorate over Greece and a new menace in the Eastern Mediterranean,(3)    &quot;/nether if we decide to give the French a free hand in Greece, their extreme unpopularity with the Greek people would render it impossible for them to exercise full control over the country and establish a French Protectorate without embarking on Military opera-tions on a very large scale..(4)    What the true position of Monsieur Vonezelos in Greece really is:   whether he is unpopular? and how far tho attacks on him can be ascribed to the intimidation and misrepresentations of his enemies and would the Liberal party in Greece revive if the Royalist system of terrorisation were removedt(5)   &apos; Whether the effect upon Italy of allowing France a free hand in Greece would be disastrous, and the jealousy which exists between the two countries in all Mediterranean questions lead, in that event, to a breach between Italy and her Allies,(6)    Whether if so,-it would be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to point out to the French the complications enumerated in 3, 4, and 5, above, and tosuggest
suggest to them and to the Italians that in view of these complications it would he better for Great Britain henceforward to undertake the direction of Allied Policy in Greece, and to secure a final solu tion of the Greek Question,(initialled)    H*G*N*12, 4? 17$
