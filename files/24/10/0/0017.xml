Circular to Borough, /^ /Vrlicm District and Rural District Councils..WASTE FOOD, PAPER, Etc.Local Government Boakd,Whitehall, S.W. 1.lUh March, 1917.1. Lord Rhondda wishes to draw the attention of local authorities to the importance at the present time of utilising waste food, partictt-Iarly fat and bones, and other organic waste both of animal and vegetable origin, and also waste paper, cardboard, etc., wherever this is practicable.2. Waste food, etc. Co-operation in the collection of waste food was suggested in the circular of the 5th January on the subject of pig- and poultry-keeping. Recent enquiries which have been made indicate that very much more is being done in some districts than in others, and Lord Rhondda wishes to urge upon all local authorities the desirability of eVery possible step being taken to secure that waste food is collected and utilised either directly or through con-tractors or by means of voluntary associations.Special provision appears generally to be made for collecting and using the waste from hotels, restaurants, schools, canteens, clubs, and other large establishments. Each local Authority should ascertain whether all that can be advantageously done in this way in their dis-trict is being done. If it is not, they should immediately consider what measures can be adopted for using the waste as food for pigs, rabbits or poultry; it may be sufficient in some cases to draw attention to the opportunities which exist of obtaining waste for pigs or other stock. In the case of private households, except where the house-holder keeps stock of his own for which the waste of the household is being used, a number of inhabitants may be induced to combine together for the utilisation of waste which can be collected by or on behalf of those who can make profitable use of it.At some places special measures are taken for utilising the waste of slaughterhouses and condemned food, and Lord Rhondda would ask local authorities generally to consider what can be done in this respect in their districts. He would also emphasize the special value of bones and fat for the production of glycerine for munitions purposes. -The separate collection of bottles, jars and tins will also be found to be profitable at the present time.3. Waste Paper. The new restrictions on the importation of paper have made it more important than ever that the greatest economy should be practised in the use of paper and that all waste paper should be utilised. In many districts the collection of waste paper, cardboard, etc., is already undertaken by waste paper dealers ,pr(4 05.)  Wt.     -130.  3,000.  3/17.  J. T. &amp; S., Ltd.  G. 14.7
through voluntary organisations, and it is not suggested that there should be any interference with these methods of collection. More can, however, be done and Lord Rhondda hopes that all Local Authorities will use their best endeavours to stimulate action. Waste paper should not be burned in dust destructors and Local Authori-ties should arrange where possible for its separation from other refuse, if collected at the same time. Householders should be urged through the local press to keep it separate from other refuse.Lord Rhondda has been in communication with the Royal Cora-mission on Paper and has received from them the appended list of paper mills in England and Wales which use waste paper. Local Authorities would do well to put themselves in communication with any of these mills which may be in their neighbourhood or readily accessible.The present price of waste paper enables many voluntary brganisa-tions to collect it and dispose of it at a profit. Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, Church Guilds, and other similar bodies have been usefully employed in this work, the proceeds being devoted to charitable purposes in connection with the war. This is a movement which local authorities might usefully encourage.It is understood that for the profitable disposal of waste paper it should be sorted into the following grades (1) Old ledgers and account books.(2) Letters and envelopes.(3) Old newspapers.(4) Books and pamphlets.  -(5) Brown and wrapping paper.(6) Cardboard, strawboard, etc.It will no doubt be found that the mills will wish to receive their waste paper from local centres in comparatively large consignments, preferably not less than two tons, and, where possible, it would be desirable to compress the paper, when sorted, into bales before dispatch.4. While offering the foregoing suggestions, Lord Rhondda leaves to local authorities the precise measures to be adopted, but he desires to impress strongly on them the importance in the first place of reducing preventible waste and secondly of making profitable use of such waste matter as is unavoidable.He will be glad to be informed as soon as this can conveniently be done of any action taken in the district.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,&quot; &apos; H. C. MONRO,Secretary.The Town Clerk, orClerk to the Council.
