Of these 27,000 were enrolled during the week,(b) Passports Department, The total number of passports so far examined is 5,280,   Of these 285 were considered during the past week when it was decided to recommend the issue of 254 and to refuse 31.(c) Finance Department.

ccoupled with Conferences with the Labour Advisory Committee, with Officials of &quot;this Department, and with representatives of the Building Trades Federation, on the subject of appoint-ing Trade Committees to deal with Substitution and Allocation of Labour.AGRICULTURAL SECTION.(a) Military and other Labour,on Farms.    1. Scotland. Reports from farmers express satisfaction at the prompt supply of labour to meet their present requirements and their apprecia-tion of the skill and usefulness of the workers supplied,   The returns to date are approximately as follows:-2,225 Army Labour on furlough, 150 from Agricultural Companies, 850 Soldiers, specially applied for by this Depart-ment now cm the land and over 200 vfho have been on the land for some time.    There are also at work over 200 employees lent by. Corporations or by other employers, bringing the total for which this Department is responsible, to about 3,450 workers.   Owing to the weather, work on farms is much behind hand, and it was therefore suggested to the Military Authorities that Military labour at present on the land should remain until the 25th May,   In response to this suggestion, it has been arranged that soldiers on furlough will remain until the following dates:-Those from France till 30th April, Men of Category A till 10th May and All others from the Home Forces till 25th Kay. 2. England.   The Board of Agriculture have been approached with a view to their endeavouring to secure in England also an extension of the period of Military, Labour.-   It is under-stood that this object will be secured.
(b) rational ^rj^e-Volunjtee-rs;.   Both in England and in Scotland the Commissioners of this Section are continuing to interview National Service Volunteers for Agriculture, but in view of the position as stated in paragraph (d) below there is nothing to report on this head.(c) Part-Time Labour.1.   School Boy Labour.   Further negotiations have been held with regard to this matter, and a meeting has been arranged with the Board of Education for next week to dis-cuss various points which have emerged,   The Boys from Rugby who have been at work in Devonshire have performed good service, and they are about to be followed by a party of boys from Clifton,2. Miner3. The Director has been considering the possi-bility of obtaining the assistance off.: miners during their hours of leisure time.    He has arranged with the Ayrshire Miners&apos; Union that they will organise a supply of farmi labour from amongst their members in shifts of four hours varying according to the hours of employment in the pit, and on the understanding that the rate of remuneration to be given by the farmer will be 9d per hour.   He has also received a communication from the Wrexham Rural Council stating that at the request of the Denbighshire County Council they have taken up a similar proposal for the purpose of securing part time assistance for agriculture from a large number of colliers in that County.-   It is thought that there can be no objection to this use of the part time of miners, as owing to their having fixed hours of work there will be no Interference with their ordinary duties.   Moreover, as they are already engaged on work of National importance it will not suggest the use p.f part
time labour among those who might readily give their full time under the National Service Scheme.When it is seen how arrangements work out in these two Counties consideration will be given to the development-of the proposal elsewhere.(d) Substitution.   Reference is again made to what was said on this subject in last week&apos;s report, and in particular to the facts mentioned in the letter received from Captain Blofield. Reports coming from the other districts in England confirm the fact that up to now there has been little or no demand for agricultural assistance from National Service Volunteers.   If the Military authorities should make any call on agricultural workers of military age there is likely to be a very large demand indeed upon the National Service Volunteers, which will in all probability exceed the available supply.   It is felt that some endeavour should be made to secure a definite under-standing with the Military authorities as to what is their intention in the matter,  so that early and adequate arrange-ments may be made for dealing with any situation whfc h may arise.PRESS INTELLIGENCE. The circulation of special articles to the Press has been continued, among them has been a stirring appeal by Mr, Maurice Hewlett and an article &quot;Text for the Times&quot; by Mr. J.J. Bell. GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a) General.   The functions of the National Service Department with regard to substitution having been definitely settled it was possible to continue the negotiations with the Trades with a view to securing their co-operation in obtaining Substitution Volunteers.   Accordingly, on the 12th April representatives of the employers and workpeople in the Print-ing and Bookbinding Trades were received by the Director and
and other officials of the Department.   The new scheme was discussed and eventually a provisional Joint Committee, consisting of the representatives of the Trades then present was appointed to carry the matter further pending the appoint-rnent of a permanent Committee, the members of which are to be elected by the National Executives of the employers and workpeople, respectively.   The Director-General gave a short address in which he enforced the reasons for obtaining sub-stitutes with the least possible delay.   The Director of Trades Section will keep in close touch with the Provisional Committees and will endeavour to expedite matters.A similar meeting with representatives of employers and operatives in the Building Trade, was held on 13th April. In this case the Central Committee of eleven on each side had already been appointed, and is authorised to co-operate with the National Service Department in carrying out the new scheme.   The meeting was attended by the Director and Deputy Director of the Trades Section.   The Director-General came and addressed the representatives on the principal points raised.   It seems probable that a considerable number of Substitution Volunteers will be obtained from these Trades.(b) Restricted Occupations Order.     The correspondence in connection with the administration of this Order continues to bo heavy.   The general lines of administration have now been worked out, the interpretations carefully revised, and an explanatory memorandum drawn up preparatory to handing the administration over to the Local National Service Commissioners.(c) Certified Occupations,     Further consideration was given to the revision of the List of Certified Occupations and an investigation was made with a view to ascertaining the
- 6 -position tn the hollow-\vare trade.(d) Concentration of Trades Section.   Investigations regarding man-power continued, and over 2,000 further returns were received in connection with Stock Exchanges, the Baltic Exchange, and the Brewing Trade.(e) Labour for getting iron ore.   The North Wales Quarry-Owners and Quarrymen held a meeting on the 11th instant to make arrangements for the provision of men for iron ore work-ing.   Those present expected to be able to find the men by the 28th, but Mr. Rowland, the Commissioner for Wales, is giving special attention to the matter and is in communica-tion with the quarry owners in hopes of securing quicker results.(f) Labour for Timber Felling.     A report has been obtained on the available supply of men for timber felling and parti-culars have been transmitted to the Controller of Timber Supplies, showing that In the opinion of tho Employment Exchanges a considerable number of men upon their books could be considered suitable for this work, although such number would, unless the rate of wages could, be improved, be-far less than Is required.   In addition, an offer of service on this work has been received (from the Swedish representa-tive on the Foreigners&apos; Committee assisting in the National Service Department) by which experienced Swedes in the London area would place their services at the disposal of the Director of Timber Supplies under the leadership of one of the most experienced Swedish timber-cutting experts.    This offer has been   communicated to the Director of Timber Supplies,, who has been informed that if he should so desire this Department would arrange for tho organisation of such a body of workers.
WOMENfS SECTION.   The following matters have occupied this Section during the week.(a) Agricultural Appeal for Women.   Arrangements for cirou-larising the existing Local Committees with reference to the Agricultural Appeal for Women have been advanced,    A sub-section of the Enrolment Section will be set up to deal with correspondence arising out of this Appeal.   To.date 8,448 Women have been enrolled in England and Scotland for service on the land.(b) Women1s Auxiliary Army Corps.    It has become necessary to set up Provincial Boards to deal with applications for service-in France,   The War Office has agreed that these&apos; should be Joint Boards representing the War Office and this Department and consisting of the Local Recruiting Officer, a representa-tive of the Adjutant General1s Department, and a National Service Commissioner,    Such a Board fo-r Scotland is in process of formation.   The constitution of these Boards cannot however be completed until the Treasury has agreed to the paymentof Women Commissioners/(c) Wood Felling.   A Conference with the Secretary of tho English Forestry Association has been held on wood felling for Women,Cd) National Service for Women - America, Hiss Larkham has conferred with Hr.
