The enrolments during this- period of six days are more than in any complete week since the National Service Scheme was launched.From a scrutiny of the summary of returns submitted by the Ministry of Labour for the period- up to March 30th, it would appear that out of 151,590 offers of service, 74,&amp;S3 have been placed on the &quot;live&quot; register aa available for transfer, and that of the latter number, 1,127 havo been placed in employment as National Service Volunteers.(b) Central Information Bureau,     The number of enquiries during the present week has slightly decreased, the majority of the questions raised having a bearing upon the Restricted Occupations Order.(c) Passports Department The total number of applications for Passports examined up to date is 4,995.

The cumulative effect of the specialeffort made during &quot;National Service Week&quot; in the circulation to the Press of daily articles, appeals and neys, is reflected in the improved enrolment figures of the current week.The total cost for the week of the arrangement made with the National Press Agency for the circulation, among 160 Pro-vincial Weekly Papers, of a stereotyped column of news and articles has been only  20.4.       The Adviser in regard to Theatres,. etc.reports:     It has been suggested to the Bill Posting section of each Theatre and Music Hall that National Service Posters might be posted with their own.      In many cases this has been acted on.A large number of Provincial Theatres and Music Halls have agreed to insert small cards in their Programmes, and 150,000 of these cards have been despatched.examination of the applications it has been decided in 3,415 cases to recommend that Passports should be issued. 294 applications were considered during the week ending April 5th.

AG-RIC&apos; uLTURAL SECTION,(a/    Military ar.3 other Labour on Farms.(3J    Scotland       The number of farm labourers distributed by the Department on the farms in Scotland up till the 3rd of April was 2,226.     Of these 200 were special men obtained by application to the Officers of individual units; 1,428 were skilled ploughmen released from the Army for the ploughing season; 427 were general farm workers; 09 came from the Agricultural Labour Companies established by the Military Authorities in Scotland, and 111 were the employees of Scottish Corporations and Local Authorities, who were lent for a short period for farm workThe method of distribution adopted ensured that, so far as practicable, the men were sent to the districts with which they were familiar,&quot;and of whose farming they had had experience.       The testimony of the farmers as to their skill and usefulness has been very gratifying.-   One matter, however, is raised which creates em-barrassment.     The uniforms and boots of the men art) re-ported in many cases to have been totally inadequate for the purposes of a farm labourer       It is difficult to know how to deal with this matter, as the Army is, of course, only responsible for the equipment of soldiers for military duty, and this Department is not at present empowered to expend money on their equipment.(2) England.     In England the Agricultural Commissionersand Sub-Commissioners have been actively engaged in many instances in helping with the distribution of Military Labour, although, as will, be remembered, this Department
is not responsible for this disfribution.      They have also placed upon farms a number of Corporation employ-ees lent for the ploughing season.Agricultural Companies, that is, Companies of Soldiers unfit for General Service, have been established and parties of men in these Companies have been offered to some proprietors who desired labour for timber cutting. They can, however   only be lent for a short period for this purpose as they will be required for agricultural work, it is believed; in the first week of May. National Service Volunteers.     Both in England and in Scotland the Commissioners of the Section have been in-terviewing National Service Volunteers for agriculture. The^ reports as to the class of those men vary.      In some instances it is  said that the men who have offered are of a kind which will prove very useful: in other instances only a small percentage seem fit to render much assistance. Part-Time.Schoolboy Labour,     Further progress has been made during&apos; the last week with regard to this matter, and a scheme has been drawn up which will be put into final shape after those interested have had an opportunity of discussing the arrange ments,Substitution. What was said cri this subject in last week&apos;s report ha3 been emphasised by a letter received from Captain Blofeld, Agricultural Commissioner for the Eastern counties, from which the following is an extract;-&quot;If it is desired to get the farmers generally to apply for and fill up their forms with .National Service. Volunteer Labour1 in order to  enable them to
release their Category &quot;A?l men, the safest and only practical way of accomplishing this will be for Government to state definitely that on a cer-tain date, say a month or two hence, they will call up for General Service all Category &quot;A&quot; men employed in agriculture up to a certain ago, with the exception of Blacksmiths, Wheelwrights, Shep-herds, Engine and Motor Plough drivers and skilled mechanics.-    Until this is done we&quot;feel certain that the farmers will prefer to muddle through with the labour they have. now got on their farms, in-...... ^tejQjd: of taking steps to find substitutes in orderto release their Category &quot;A&quot; men. GENERAL TRADES SECTION.(a)   Substitution.     The question of how far, if at all, the National Service Department is to undertake the work of Substitution has occupied much of the time of the Director and Deputy Director.     Until this question is settled, the activities of the Trades Section will continue to be very much hampered.In connection with the new scheme of special substitu-tions, a conference was held with representatives of the Admiralty and Ministry of Muni.tione. with a view to finding out exactly what the demand of these Departments for substi-tutes is and the general conditions under which any substi-tutes supplied would have to work.     It is felt that the ob-taining of this information is a necessary preliminary to the approaching of the various trades with a view to securing\  :;:y   .&apos;:y-   yy/yy ;     , . - - -.. &apos; &apos;. .    -v    &apos; &apos;        - &apos; y.y:y       : /   .        ;   &apos;their co-operation in releasing men,
(b) Re-organisation of Section-     The re-organisation of the work of this Section has been continued but is not yet complete, as it must depend to some extent upon the settlement of the above(c) Restricted Occupations Order       The correspondence in connection with the administration of this Order continue^. Altogether over 1,600 enquiries have been dealt with in this connection, and the general lines of administration have now been worked out.(d) Certified- Occupations.     The revision of the List of Reserved Occupations was proceeded with, and in connection therewith a conference was held with s-ajor Rothchild, Military Representative for the City, to discuss the present position as regards recruiting in the City area.(e) Concentration&apos; of Trades Department The collection and summarising of returns covering various industries and commer-cial occupations was continued. In addition to the enquiries already referred to, the London Stock Exchange and the Baltic Exchange have been asked to furnish particulars of their staffs. Reports have been drawn up with reference to Railways and Tram and Omnibus Services.Commissioners.     Commissioners have continued their work in connection with the Enrolment Campaign.     They have also been actively engaged in dealing with protests from employers and operatives and with the granting of certificates for trav-elling and subsistence allowances.Steps have been taken to obtain the names of persons re-presentative of employers and operatives,  suitable to serve on the panels of the Appeal Courts.     In some districts the names have already been obtained; in others the arrangements are not yet completed.     In London and Coventry some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining names of persons to represent
1the operatives; the Trades Councils in both places have de-clined to nominate anyone on the ground that labour is entirely opposed to National Service in Its present form.W0F5ri&apos;S SECTION.(a) Recruiting Women for Agricultural Work.     Administrative work in connection with the Agricultural appeal has absorbed much time in the Women&apos;s Section during- the last week.     Comferences have been held with the Board of Agriculture as to the best meth-ods of working &quot;up recruiting, 5,795 enrolments have been received up-to-date for the Women&apos;s Land Army in England and Scotland.(b) KEKTIHGS.     The meetings proposed&apos; for Liverpool and Manchester have been postponed owing to difficulties of organisation and speakers.     A meeting has been arranged for Leeds on April 13th.(c) Rates of.Pay and Accommodation for Women in the Flying Corps. Conferences with the War Office and the representatives of Trade Unions have been held over the Rates of Pay for women in the Flying Corps.     The rates have been settled by general agreement, and the Women&apos;s Section is now urging the r&apos;ar Office to deal with the question of accommodation at the aerodromes, for which little or no provision exists.&apos;&amp;) Collection of Cotton and Woollen Waste.     Further ste^s hove been taken as regards the Collection of Cotton and ,rroollen waste. The approval of Lord Rhondda has been secured for approaching the Local Authorities, and the Local Government Board will as-sist the scheme.     A Conference of the voluntary societies has been called to draw up a pl&amp;n for propaganda and collection, (e) Women Clerks for Service,in France.     The War Office has been notified that the supply of women clerks from the London Area, who have volunteered for service in France, is coming to an end, and it will be necessary to set up provincial Boards to deal with applications from the country.(Signed)    E.
