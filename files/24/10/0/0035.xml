(Note &quot;by tlie Foreign Office.)&apos;On November loth the War Committee authorised the Secretary of State for   Foreign. Affairs,  as a result of. previous discussions, to inform the Norwegian Government that they would be permitted to purchase five anti-aricraft Guns in this country,&apos;. suitable arrangements being devised to give it the colour of an .ordinary commercial transaction.On December 12th the policy to be adopted by E.M.G* inregard to Norway came before the War Cabinet.   Lord Curzonpointed out the incongruity of our making preparations to aerialgive/assistance to Norway in view of the political situation with regard to Norway at that time.Lord Robert Cecil considers that the situation has now changed, and that it would greatly facilitate our dealings with Norway if they did. not feel themselves absolutely at the mercy of German Zeppelins.&apos;The. Norwegian Minister has informed Lord Robert Cecil privately that his Government would be very thankful if they might have a restricted number of anti-aircraft guns - viz .-thirteen guns, of which eight would be used for the Norsk Eydro, and also some 20 aeroplanes.Lord Robert understands that it has hitherto been found impossible by the military authorities to supply any further&apos; anti-aircraft Guns to Norway on account of an unexpected demand for an increase of such guns with British forces. . A similar refusal has been made to the Dutch Government.Lord Robert desires to bring this subject again beforethe War Cabinet,, as soon as possible, in view of the impor-tance of not leaving Norway defenceless against aircraft at thpresent moment and in connection with the possible entry of   -Norway into the War..Foreign Office.-April 12th, 1917V
