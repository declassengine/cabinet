ISTET  OF  POOD.Report for Fortnight ending Wednesday, April 11, 1917.PART I-ACTION TAKEN. :Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.The following Orders have been made by the Food Controller during the period under review:  \(1) Intoxicating Liquor (Output and Delivery) Order, 1917, dated March 29th, .1917. This Order restricts the output of beer in the United Kingdom to 10,000,000 barrels, as indicated in the Prime Ministers speech of 23rd February 1917. The method of. distribution to be. followed is as pre-scribed by the Output of Beer (Restriction) Act, 1916. A corresponding restriction is placed on the delivery of wine and spirits, the authorised amount being reduced to 50 per cent, of the amount delivered during the year 1916.(2) Seed Potatoes (Trices) Order (No. 2) 1917, dated April 3rd, 1917. This Order continues, until May 1st, 1917, the general provisions of the existing Orders relating to seed potatoes. The price, however, is increased by 21. per ton all round, and a general definition- is substituted for the description by reference to schedules.&apos;   (3) Manufacture of Bread and Flour Order (No. 3) 1917, dated April 4th, 1917.This Order increases the percentage of other cereals directed or authorised to be mixed with wheaten flour. The admixture is to be npt more than 25 per cent, and not less than 10 per cent. id(1) Public Meals Order, 1917, dated April 4th, 1917.   This Order provides in detail for the regulation of meals served in public by a system of rationing -   . in bulk on the analogy of the system of voluntary rationing, alreadyprescribed for private households. An allowance of meat, sugar, bread, and flour is made for each individual meal actually served, and the caterer must bring his weekly consumption of these articles wdthin the limits of the prescribed allowance. One meatless day and five potatoless days are instituted in every week. The Order comes into operation on April 15th; it does not apply to railway buffets or: to eating-houses where only meals . costing Is. 3d. or less are served,(5) Food Hoarding Order, 1917, dated April 5th, 1917. This Order prohibits the acquisition or storage of foodstuffs beyond ordinary requirements,, the onus of proving what such requirements are being thrown upon the householder. A corresponding prohibition is imposed on sellers with means of knowledge that a customer is exceeding his due share. Power . -of search is given to any person authorised in writing by the Food Controller. &quot;The Order does not affect purchases made in the way of business or accumulations effected for purposes of home production....   (6) Tea (Net Weight) Order, 1917, dated April 5th, 1917.   This Order enforces, ;. as from July 1st, 1917, the sale- by net weight of all tea&quot; sold by retail, /whether contained in a package or not,. excepting tea sold in a quantity of less than 2 pzs.   The Order gives effect to the recommendation on this point of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Short Weight.Control&apos;: of -Prices and Supplies.Cereals:-An Inter-Departrhental Conference wxes h^ at the Ministry of Food on the lOth April 1917, on the question of the Restriction of the Use of Cereals for purposes other than Huuian Food. .

Brewing and Malting, rg The necessity for conserving the&quot;whole available stock of barley for human food, arid the prohibition of malt substitutes made from rice and maize have made it important to obtain the entire control of. the manufacture and use of malt throughout the country. Moreover, Owing to-the lise, of retail price of beer the process of home brewing has tended to assume -undue proportions having regard to the fact that no provision is made for limiting the use of malt in this industry which ordinarily requires no licence and pays no revenue. It is, therefore, proposed to issue an Order taking control of the stocks other than those held by farmers.-!l -.&apos; 1 Food Economy Campaign,   &quot;: v.-The: object of the Food Economy Campaign is to obtain, a reduction in the consuhiptibn: of - * bread and flour,; and&apos; to elirhihate waste in all-food&apos;(stuffs.- - Twelve hundred.^. War Savings -Committees in England imd Wales/ in- most&quot; cases with the co-operation of the Local Authorities have; formed Food Campaign Committe^s^foroafe/maize, rice, and rye, the&quot; question of wheat having been settled by the Wheat (Restriction) Order,.1917. As&apos;regards oats,&quot;the problem merely regarded food for horses, and the opinion was that steps should be taken to stop the use of grain after the beginning of May for all except world rig horses.   ;/;- &quot; ; f-^ZZS^f^. A^   -It was further decided to. recommend that the use of all cereals for industrial purposes should be prohibited except by licence, and there was a general agreement that it might be necessary after further consideration to issue an Order prohibiting the sale of maize to farmers from the 1st June to the 31st October except for the purpose of feeding milch cows.3:,Sugar:-The Departmental Committee appointed by the Food Controller, under the Chairmanship of Lord Somerleyton, to inquire into the whole system and method of.Sugardistribution, have presented their Report, which is under,consideration.! Meantime the question of stocks of sugar in the country has been causing some anxiety. The tonnage promised by the Admiralty has not. always been forthcoming on the appointed dates, and the delay thus caused together with the loss of three sugar ships has resulted in the stocks in the United Kingdom running dangerously low. For the moment it is impossible to supply the refiners with the requisite amount of raw sugar ; but it is hoped that fresh supplies constantly arriving will improve the position and that by the end of this month all cause for anxiety will have ceased.- ,The.--Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply are in communication with the &quot;War Department with a view to effecting some economy in the consumption, of sugar by the Army, both at home and abroad, and there is every prospect that a substantial saving will be effected. They are further endeavouring to impress.upon the Ministry of Shipping the importance of maintaining the sugar imports at an adequate figure, and the. danger 0f any curtailment of tonnage available for the conveyance of sugar at the,present time..,j It was. announced in the Press on. March 30th that,, bjaving regard to the stocks of brewers&apos; sugar now in the country as disclosed by returns made under the Brewers&apos; Sugar; (Returns) Order, 1917, the Food Controller had decided to issue licences under the Brewers&apos; Sugar Order, 1917, to enable manufacturers generally to acquire and use^fhis, sugar as a proportionate part of their normal supply. This arrangement is designed.to release for domestic consumption sugar of a better quality which would otherwise be used for purposes of manufacture.Milk. At the request of the President, of the Board of Agriculture and the Secretary for Scotland, the Food Controller is amending the Price, of Milk Order so as .to allow winter contracts which, under that Order,, were terminated on March 31st to run to April 30th, and also to. allow the prices chargeable in April 1917 to be calculated by reference to the prices.prevailing in March 1914.;-;J Potatoes. Since the 1st April,&apos; when the increased prices came into operation, the stocks of potatoes on the markets have shown a decrease, it. would, therefore, appear that: the suggestion that farmers and dealers were withholding their stocks from the markets in order to obtain the benefit of higher prices, was without foundation.
the purpose of local propaganda, and a handbook covering all the points on Food Economy, and particularly in the saving of foodstuffs, has been prepared and circulated. In Scotland, the National War Savings Committee is joining forces with the Patriotic Food League, and with the. aid of the Secondary Education Authorities is formulating a campaign on the lines which haye been adopted in England. Every newspaper in the country has been instructed as to&apos; the purpose of the campaign and is giving its support. Members of Parliament are. being invited to address for publication a letter on the subject to their constituents ; the clergy of all denominations, the Salvation Army and other religious bodies are being asked.to lend their aid and their organisations ; and the Board of Educa-tion has promised the assistance of its domestic science and other teachers in the prosecution of the campaign among school children. Negotiations are in progress to utilise the cinemas and all other means of publicity for the purpose of concentrating public attention on the necessity for economy in food. Insurance companies and other institutions possessing house-to-house canvassers are being invited to take part in the work ; while special efforts are being made to establish and preserve a week-to-week propaganda among munition workers. Posters, leaflets, handbills, speeches,-sermons, and a war-time cookery book are included among the literature of the campaign. Vigorous efforts are also being made towards inducing the Local Authorities to establish communal kitchens where the preparation of cheap bread substitutes can be demonstrated, and where meals, wholly cooked, can be supplied. Already many authorities have established these kitchens, and in Leeds, Bradford, Hull, and other towns with complete success.Enforcement of Orders.Numerous cases of alleged contravention of the Potato Orders have been referred to the police for investigation, with a view to prosecution if an offence is established. A number of Inspectors of Weights and Measures have been empowered to prosecute in case of contraventions of the Bread Order. A firm of wholesale milk sellers was convicted at the North London Police Court on the 11th inst. for selling milk in excess of the maximum price, and was fined 1001. with ten guineas costs. An inspector is investigating statements about the food position in the East End of London as a result of the deputation of women wljich was received by Lord Devonport on April 2nd.PART II. SUMMARY OF FOOD POSITION.. .....     . m&apos; .,. : m     :,. . - .    &apos; .  &apos;       .- ..   r / ,No Report having been prepared in the week before Easter, the present Report covers two weeks. The tables printed in the body of the Report relate to the last&apos; week under review. For the sake of completeness, the weekly tables as to imports and wholesale prices, which would have appeared in the previous week&apos;s Report if prepared, are printed in an Appendix as Tables Al and Bl. The notes below deal with the position in the last week.........    ....... . &apos; ------ .Imports.Imports of food during the week ended April 7th, show some improvement, though not sufficient to compensate for the deficiencies of the weeks immediately preceding. The total imports of the principal foods and feeding-stuffs, shown in Table A, during the week, amount altogether to 195,052 tons. This compares with 156,979 during the week ended March 31, 275,608 during the corresponding week of 1916, and 191,966 as the average for the first 14 weeks of 1917.For the first time, accordingly, since the beginning of March, the imports for the last week are slightly above the average for the year up to date. This is due almost entirely, however, to relatively large imports of barley, oats, maize, and butter. The imports of wheat and wheaten flour, in particular, are still below the average.For. the first 14 weeks of the year the total imports amount to 2,729,528 tons, as compared with 3,360,186 tons in the corresponding period of 1916, showing a decrease of 630,658 tons, or 19 per cent. The principal decreases are in wheat, 92,140 tons ; sugar, 106,908 tons ; barley, 140,680 tons; and oats, 159,585 tons., The only articles showing an increase over 1917, as compared with 1916, are butter, cheese, margarine, and maize. .     .    -   ; . ...A  2796-1 a 2
Z, . The imports of rice in the 14weeks ended April 7th, 1917, average 4,798 tons a tons a week as against 9,592 in the corresponding period of 191G.. Of this deficiency of 4,791 about. 1,930 is compensated for by a decline of re-exports,&apos; which&apos; are now subject to stringent restriction. There remains, however, a net deficiency, of. over 1,800 tons a week. This is very serious in view of the undoubted increase in. demand for rice, both as a substitute for potatoes and as an ingredient in making flour. The amount of rice for which tonnage was demanded in the indent sent to the Shipping Controller by the Ministry, of Food was 50,000 tons a month from March to August. The demands on the Wheat Commission are said now to be at the rate of 60,000 tons a month for the London, Liverpool and Bristol Channel districts alone. The imports expected by the Wheat Commission with the tonnage likely to be available average about 26,000 tons a month from now to August.Imports of oilseeds for the three months, January, February and March amount ito 348,878 tons against 375,958 tons in the corresponding period last year, giving a decrease of 27,080 tons or .7*2 per cent. Imports of oilseed cake, on the other hand, ishow a slight increase.Stocks. .Wheat. The stocks of wheat and flour (as wheat) on April 9th are estimated at 1,177,000 tons as compared with 1,344,000 tons four weeks before on March 12th, and 1,482,000 tons on the corresponding date in 1916.Barley. The stocks on April 9th, apart from stocks in maltsters&apos; hands, are estimated at 148,000 tons as compared with 167,000 tons on March 12th. As stated in the last report, stocks in maltsters&apos; hands on March 10th were returned at 310,000 tons, but part of this will now have been sold and may appear as millers&apos; stocks or have been consumed.Oats.-The stocks on April 9th are estimated at 490,000 tons as compared with 798,000 tons on March, 12th.Maize.---The stocks on April 9th are estimated; at 151,000, tons as compared with 191,000 tons on March 12th. r .   .Consumption of Meat and Bread.Meat (Table B,).-The supplies entering the Central Market, London, during March show a fall of 8*4 per cent, as compared with the corresponding month last year; Manchester shows a fall of 16&apos;1 per cent.; Glasgow a fall of 5*5 per cent.; And Liverpool a fractional increase. Taking together the four markets from which returns are now available, the supplies in March 1917&quot;averaged 7,517. tons per week against 8,2.1.6 tons per week in March 1916, a fall of 699 tons or 8 * 5 per cent; This is, however, rather less than half the fall observed in February 1917 as compared with February 1916. The supplies entering the markets at London, Manchester and Glasgow during March in each case show an increase as compared with the month before, and Liverpool only a very small decrease. In 191(3 Glasgow was the only market showing larger supplies in March than in February. For the week ending-April 7th only two returns are as yet available. London supplies show a heavy fall but this is probably related to the fact that April 8th was Easter Sunday.The supplies of fat stock at certain markets in Great Britain during March (Table C.) show a very small decrease of less than 1 per cent., as compared with the average of 1914-16, in the case of cattle and sheep, but a fall of 19*5 per cent, in the case of pigs.&quot; The average entries of cattle and sheep during March show a considerable increase as compared with February, but the entries of pigs continue to decline. For the week ending April 4th the entries of cattle, sheep and pigs are all above the corresponding averages for the past three years, though lower than the averages for March.&apos;Bread. Reference was made in the Report for the week ending March 28th to inquiries made through the National Association of Master Bakers as to the amount .of\ flour used foi\I)read-making and flour - confectionery by tho principal members of ,the ^Council of the Association.&apos;.; Returns,have .now. Been, received from &apos;30 bakers jn .25^ towns, arid show that 12,932 sacks (280 lbs.) of flbur:were used ;in- these bakeries during the four weeks ending February 5th, 1916; 13,816 sacks; during

The returns for February 1917 accordingly show an increase of 6&apos;0 per cent, in consumption as compared with; January 1917j and an increase of 10&apos;3 per cent, as compared with February 1916. The increase is, no doubt, connected with the shortage of potatoes, and the cold weather. The sample is. not a large one, but the. towns from which returns have been obtained are distributed all over the country,, and only four of the returns show a smaller quantity of flour used in March 1917 than in- February 1910,, Farther returns to cover the four weeks ending March 31st are being obtained from the same firms, and it is hoped to obtain much more, extensive returns, for the next following-period. ...... , &apos;     &apos;      . - -     - .  r &quot; . .. Wholesale Prices,. ;The Gazette average price of British wheat (Table D) shows an increase of 2s. lid. as compared with the price of the preceding week, and that of . oats an increase of 3s, 3d. The price of barley, on the other hand, has fallen slightly, and also the prices of rice and of Danish bacon. In most other cases changes on the week are small. Compared. with the prices of-a month ago, wheat has increased 8 per cent, and oats over 13 per cent., while, the smaller increases on tea and mutton are maintained. NewT Zealand butter, and cheese, both English and Canadian, show a fall of about 6 per cent.Compared with the corresponding prices of last year, oats show the greatest increase (over 80 per cent.) and wheat shows an increase of over 60 per cent. Cheese and tea both show an increase of between 50 and 60 per cent., and rice an increase of 40 per cent. Beef shows an increase of nearly 40 per cent, and mutton of over 20 per cent. In the case of bacon, on. an average of Irish, Danish, and Canadian, the increase is rather over 30 per&apos; cent.&apos;-&apos;-&apos;;&apos;- -   Retail Prices. .&apos;In the Report for the week ending Wednesday, March 28th, statistics were given showing the course of retail food prices from the outbreak of the war to March 1st, 1917. In Tables E and F the figures are brought up to the beginning of April 1917.From Table E it will be seen that there was a further rise, during March, in the average level of retail prices of the princij3al articles of food, the general percentage above &quot;normal prices in July 1914&quot; being 94&apos;0 at the beginning of April, as compared with 92&apos; 1 at March 1st. The principal increases during the month were in margarine (13 per cent, on the prices of July 1914), bread (11 per cent.), cheese (11 per cent.), and fish (10 per cent.). There were also substantial, though smaller, advances in the prices of meat, bacon, flour, and tea. On the other hand there was a seasonal fall of 46i per cent, in the price of eggs and a slight decline in those of butter and potatoes.For all the principal articles combined, the average monthly rate of increase during the war, expressed as a percentage of prices in July 1914, has &quot;been as follows :-r-     . ;
the prices of-certain articles-such as, eggs and butter-normally decline and thus affect the average rise tor all articles taken&apos; together. -   &quot;      ;.. ii .Thb articles showing the greatest increase in price at the end of March 1917., as cotnpared with July 1914,; are sugar (172 per cent.), breasts of frozen mutton (157 per cent.), thin flanks of chilled or frozen beef \ 132 per cent.), and fish (132 per cent.). ; Cither articles of which the prices have risen by over 100 per cent, are the remaining cuts of chilled or frozen meat, the. cheaper cuts of British beef and mutton, potatoes, &quot;cheese and flour.   The articles showing least increase are margarine (49 per cent.), milk (60 per cent.), and tea (62\ per cent.). -   The marked rise which occurred in February 1917, in the prices of the subsidiary ^llticlesCwcliided in Table F., and to which reference was made in the last Report, continued in March at an accelerated pace, the increase during the month averaging ..42 per cent, on pre-war prices.   The principal increases during March (expressed as &quot;percentages of prices in July 1914) were as follows : Haricot beans -     -     -     -     -     -  122 per cent.Sago      -     -     - -     -    80    ,,k^m    -T-&apos;.     Butter beans   -     -     -     -     -     -    66    ,,M*      t:.l      Lentils    -      -      -      -   .  -      -      -    38    ,,[.[: Tapioca - -     -     - -    37    ,,i ):   All of these followed upon substantial increases during February.vTEe prices of these subsidiary foods have shown a quite remarkable movement, since the. beginning of the present year.   During the 30 months to December 1916,&quot;these prices increased on an average at exactly the same rate as the principal foods v.shown iii Table E. (2-9* per cent.).   Since then while the prices of the principalfoods have,maintained a similar course (rising by 2*0, 3*3, and 1&apos;9 per cent, in &apos;^JaliuaryT,February, and March respectively), the corresponding increases for the ,0 s^psidiary foods have been. 11 * 3, 31&apos; 6, and 42 * 4 per cent.   This rise of prices indicatesan increase of demand in relation to supplies which must almost certainly lead to &apos; early exhaustion of the supplies or to putting the articles beyond the reach of the 7wpfking;;class. It is somewhat noticeable that rice has shown no increase of price &quot;during March, though&quot; as indicated elsewhere, the position in regard to rice is very -disquieting.s-;.7rr:-cV ,--;-:-:---:----* The figure was wrongly given as 2&quot; 6 in the last Eeport.
