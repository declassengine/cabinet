CAB/Circulated by the Secretary of State for India. SECRET.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, mh March 1917.3457. - Indian representatives, Imperial War Cabinet, want to. know what additional effort they can promise on behalf of India on the assumption that whilst doing all we can this year decisive result will not be obtained till next year. The most important consideration is what fighting man-power can you produce and train to be fit to put into the field in early spring of 1918 in addition to numbers to which you are already committed. This fresh effort would be primarily directed to the relief of British troops now serving in India, Mesopotamia, or Egypt.But you may be able to spare or raise units not suitable for use against Turks.   In that case it might be possible to employ them in France.Do you think you could, for instance, raise 100,000 men for these objects ? I realise that to do so you will have to resort largely to enlistment of classes that have hitherto not been considered the best for providing fighting men. In particular, I wish you to consider whether experiment of Bengali double company might not be largely extended. Consider also particularly the possibility of obtaining more Jats and Mahrattas, but please pass in review all possible resources of India. Present recruiting methods seem capable of considerable improvement, and recruiting organisations would have to be largely expanded. I suggest introduction of some new blood in your recruiting agencies and mudi more use than has been made up to date of the authority of ruling Princes and Chiefs in their States, and of our own civil authorities and local magnates in British India. The unofficial classes should also, I think, be called upon to assist. Perhaps some suitable developments of advertisement agency might also be made use of. You will, understand that the necessity for exerting the maximum strength of the Empire is so great that every means that can be devised should be employed, and all possible sources of recruitment thoroughly examined afresh. I realise that it may not be possible to make such a large addition to the Army under the conditions on which the Indian soldier now serves. I suggest that you consider whether temporary enlistment for the term of the Avar might not meet the case; also that as present pay may not be considered sufficiently attractive by classes who have not hitherto provided many fighting men, some form of temporary pay or bonus may be necessary. Please report fully by telegraph what you think could be clone. I will then ascertain whether arms and equipment will be available. I assume that you will be able to draw many officers from Territorials now in India, as you will be able to give them nearly a year&apos;s training.From Viceroy, Army Department, 11th April 1917. (Received 10 a.m., 12th.) Your telegram of the 28th ultimo, 3457. The Government of India cordially welcome all suggestions tending towards development of lndia&apos;s contributions in personnel in the prosecution of this war, with the urgency of which they are fully conversant. As you indicate, the recruiting problem is the dominating factor in relation to the expansion of the Indian Army, but it would appear, from your telegram that you are not fully aware what has recently been done to readjust and enlarge the machinery Avhich deals with this subject. During the past five months a plan has been drawn up with the concurrence of the Punjab, United Provinces, and Bombay Govern-ments, whereby active co-operation of the civil authorities and the assistance of the influential local citizens is being utilised to the fullest extent. The system has not been extended to Madras owing to the prospect of recruiting being so poor in that province. Representatives of the Adjutant-GeneraTs branch have visited the highest civil authorities throughout greater part of India to discuss matters relating to the provision of men and to solicit advice and assistance. Civil representatives of all provinces have assembled at Delhi and conferences have been held with a view to promoting combination and co-ordination between military and civil authorities. In other parts of the country efforts have been made to tap different classes of society
that did not previously find men for army, but the results have not been encouraging.   You refer in your telegram to the experiment of Bengal double company and recommend its large extension.   This policy was taken in hand about two months ago.   Governor was urged to expand flow of recruiting.   He was recommended to invoke aid of local magnates to encourage recruiting in that province.   With a view to progress beyond double company supplied, Bengal was asked to find men for one battalion and a signal company supported by a sufficient quota at the depot to enable these units to keep the field should they be sent on service.   There are at present no indications that this demand will be found.   Although we have deemed it advisable to try and secure units from all parts of India, we do not lose sight of the fact that the creation of fresh units from non-fighting races is an innovation which can only be followed to a very restricted degree whilst war is &quot;in progress.   We have not now a sufficiency in officers and non-commissioned officers to justify our embarking largely in such an experiment  which in the case of  each unit formed  demands a  full complement  of  officers, non-commissioned  officers and  a proportion  of trained private soldiers.   Possibility of obtaining more -Tats and Mah-rattas has also been investigated.   In the latter case certain difficulties have been experienced which it is hoped are being surmounted, but in a voluntary system of recruiting expectations formed are not always realised. In fact it can be stated that there are practically no classes of Indians who are not taken for some form of service.   You recommend, it is noted, that much more use should be made for recruiting purposes of authority of Iluling Chiefs and Princes.   Experience does not offer solid hopes for this source.   Units of the Chiefs which are now on service had reached such a condition of depletion that 1 felt it necessary to address a letter to each Chief urging him to stimulate recruitment for their upkeep.   With regard to your suggestion that India should raise an additional 100,000 men it will be well that you should understand that we have in contemplation :  (1) Raising of the following additional units, viz., 3 Mountain Batteries, 8 Companies of&apos;Sappers and Miners, I-&apos; Divisional Signal Companies, and 23 Battalions of Infantry; (2) Increasing ol the establishments of all Indian Infantry Battalions serving overseas to British War Establishment; and (3) Recruitment of the 4,(ill gunners and 13,640 drivers plus 1,098 non-commissioned officers demanded in your telegram of the 30th ultimo, 003. The foregoing measures will entail recruitment of 101,453 additional men as an initial step, and the maintenance of a monthly rate of recruits amounting to 17,230 men as compared with an average of 8.095 men a month enlisted during the war, and the monthly average of 1,225 which represented the normal peace requirements of the Indian Army prior to the outbreak of the Avar. We cannot expect either to raise the additional units and increased estab-lishments or to maintain the necessary high monthly rate of recruitment given above, under present conditions of pay, and further inducements will be needed Avhich will shortly be discussed in Council.   But any extension of cadres in India must be carefully watched in reference to the number of British officers available.   Quits of the Indian Army must be controlled by officers conversant with the language, habits and customs of men they command.   The number possessing these qualifications is not unlimited and Mesopotamia forms a heavy drain on our resources in this regard.   In the recent fighting, 88 British officers have been killed, whom we have had to replace.   The Territorials in India have not responded as a source of supply to the degree anticipated, and with the prospects of their units being sent out of India, we obviously cannot expect that many will care to join the Indian Army.   Moreover, no British officer whose experience Avith Indian troops is limited to a year pan be regarded as fully qualified for his position.You will see from the foregoing that our aims more than anticipate the 100,000 men you mention. We are not at present certain that we shall be able to complete the programme outlined above, but at any rate the substance of this telegram offers proposals of sufficient promise Avith which Indian delegates can approach Imperial War Conference.* This word should be &quot; Cabinet.&quot;
