SECRET &quot;C.T, 431IMPERIAL&quot; WAR . CABINETThe Sltuation in   GreeceBefore the Imperial War Cabinet decide to acquiesce in the French demand for a reversal of the policy agreed upon at the Rome Conference, it is necossary to keep the main facts of the situation olOarlt; in viowci&apos;:t the outbreak of the war at least 95 per cent of the population of Greetg wore on the side of the Alliese     Even when the first difficulties arose between If-* Yeniselos and the Eing two--thirds of those wore Yeirizelists and the remainder, though. .. opposed to Yenisolos. were still pro-Ally,.     Nor is It true,that the King and the General Staff v/ere at tho time hostile to the Alliesi     In April and May, 1915, the Government of M*Gounaris made several offers of milioary cc-operation to the Allies. Those offers wore rejected or   ignored because they included a request for guarantees that Greece should be supported in the contingency of Bulgaria turning hostile.     Judging by tho event. the request was obviously a perfectly justifiable 0210aIn June, 1915. the   Elections were carried by M-Yenizelcs by a substantial majority^     At the end of September the Bulgar-ian mobilisation brought about a political crisis,     MoYeniizelos arranged that Allied troops should pass through Salonika in order to ho.;.p Greece fulfil her treaty obligations to Serbia,.     The General Staff took the view that it was impossible for the Greek army to face the Gorman-Bulgarian attack, and that the military conditions of the treaty with. Serbia had not been fulfilled:,     The King, following tho advloo of the General Staff, dismissed M,7enizelos,     At that moment; tho Allies would have &quot;been justified in intervening - on the ground of the treaty, of the arrangements already come to with tho Greel: Governmsit, and of the doubtful- constitutionality - of the King1 s action;.
- fj -The Allies, however, accepted the King !-g decision for the moment.     But their diplomacy devoted itself to the task of trying to secure the return of M. Venizelos to.power and working up the Veaizelist movement.     The inevitable consequence in a country of keen party feeling was that the pro-Entente hut anti-Venizeiist minority gradually became, anti-Entente,     Meanwhile, at Solonika the French committed one highhanded action after another, showing in every possible way their contempt for the. Greek army and Greek Government.    The feeling of indignation and resentment against the French grew stronger in the.array every monthi    The Corps of Officers, with a few exceptions,, became anti-Entente, and the same gradually became .true of the rank and file as well.   Outside of the army too large numbers of persons who had been Venizelists changed their views,Cn the&quot; advice of M, Venizelos the Allies compelled the King to demobilise the army at the beginning of.. June in order that the Reservists, when released to their homes, should be free to vote,  the assumption being that a Venizolist majority would still be secured, OSllftThe pretext for the demobilisation was the cession by the Greek troops without resistance of the frontier post of Fort Rupel to the BulgariansIt is necessary to remember that, just before this the adjoining frontier fort Leva Tepe had similarly been yielded to the&apos;French, and the course taken by the Greek Government was,  as a matter of fact;  the only one consistent with neutrality.The demobilisation left Eastern Laccdonia defenceless, and as soon as It was completed the Bulgarians invaded the country,     A great outcry was raised by the Venizelists because the skeleton cadres of Greek troops left in the area made no resistance.     But the Greek public generally .held M. Venizelos responsible for the loss of their richest province.     The
ctir among Ysnoselists was, borrow oivfutil-i^ed, by-^nar^-iiar^il to got up liiS: faked revolution at Salonika,   She humiliation and ill-treatment inflicted upon Grook officers and men who refused to take part in this had the Tory worst possible effect in Greece Gvon more disastrous was the effect of tho stories, naturally exaggeratod, of the manner in which the now-revolutionary army v/as being raised.     As a matter of fact it is true that Greek soldiers-who had boon brought round from ilavalla were shot for remising to join the revolution and that in Macedonia at any rate tho revolutionary army was raised entirely by compulsion and largely by a system of dragonnades, the villagers being rounded up or hunted down on the hill-sides, a not inconsiderable portion making such resistance as they&apos; could.     A considerable number managed to find their way by boat&apos; or over the mountains into Greece,   Apart from the islands, where tho movement was really spontaneous once li0 7enizelos threw in his lot with it, it may safely be said- that the revolution would never have sprea anywhere in Macedonia except by force, and it spread nowhere outside the area actually occupied by tho Allied troops,,Tho change of feeling in Greece was so great that the original idea of insisting on an Election was abandoned, and the T-reok Government wore informed that they would not be allowed to bold an Election, the fact undoubtedly being that an Election hold at any time after September, 1915, would have resulted in aa overwhelming /loyalist majority,The highhanded action of the Allies at Athens, and more particularly tho conduct of.their Secret Service agents, gradually brought people up to the state of feeling which preceded the armed resistance of the Greek soldiery and. populace to tho Allied attempt to deprive the Greek army of its artillery.    The whole of the Allied Controls over posts and telegraph,  etc. were swept away,,and any attempt&apos; at that moment to carry out the
1French policy would have involved war.   - At that time the Greek army was mainly concentrated in Thessaly, and on mobilisation would have been sufficiently formidable to make it impossible for General Sarrail to retain/his position at Eonastir.    The Greek army and people in fact wanted war, but were held back by the King &amp;ho was anxious at all hazards to keep the peace.  .A way out of the difficulty was found at the Home Conference by the undertaking given by the Allies that they would not encourage the extension of the Venezelist movement -. into the parts of Greece that had not already joined it. On this definite understanding the Greek Government agreed to withdraw its troops into the Morea, where they could not possibly inter-fere with the safety of the Allies at Salonika, to submit to the reimpoatlon of the Allied Controls, and to various other con-ditions.    Reports of Sir F.Elliot and of the Military Control officers show that in the main these conditions have been fully carried out.It is now proposed, on the strength of occasional paragraphs in the Greek newspapers still indicating their animos-ity to the French and to K.Venizelos, and on rumours as to a certain amount of rifles still being, hidden in Thessaly, to reverse the policy of the Rome Conference,- to invade Royalist Greece in order to occupy,Earissa, and generally to placate the French Chamber by dealing drastically with the King. .Leaving entirely on one side any question of the morality of the policy advocated, it is necessary to bear two main considerations in vie?;.     The first is that this, policy will almost certainly be resisted;    Even though the resistance will not be as formidable as it would have been last December, it would be a great mistake to under-estimate- it, and It v-ouid certainly involve a serious diversion of effort from the business
of defeating the Bulgarians and Germans in that quarter, for ?;hich purpose our force is by no means excessive, in order to&apos; open up a new campaign against bands of irregulars, a cam-palgn that is not unlikely to be waged in a pretty barbarous fashion by both sides.The second consideration is that this policy would create intense excitement and suspicion in Italy, and would greatly aggravate the existing discord between the French and Italians i .-1 regular scramble between the two armies for the possession of as much Greek territory as possible may result leading even to highly unpleasant incidents between them.However unpleasant it may be for the French Government to inform the Chamber that its wishes with regard to Greece cannot be carried out, the result of a serious quarrel between France and Italy,- ana the diversion of the Salonika force from operations against a common enemy to a campaign conducted purely to satisfy French temper and French local amb^itions would be infinitely mane serious.(Initialled)    L.S.A13th April 1917
