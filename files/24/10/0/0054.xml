BELGIAN RELIEF COMMISSION.

FOREIGN OFFICE MEMORANDUM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE WAR CABINET.

(War Cabinet Minutes 109, conclusion 7).

With reference to the financial position of the Belgian Relief Commission, the War Cabinet decided on March 30th that Lord Robert Cecil should consult the French Government as to the desirability of increasing the subsidy, and should inform them that we could only agree to it on condition that the French Government paid half tho increase.

Lord Robert Cecil has hopes of the U.S. Government taking over practically the whole financial to burden of the relief work. He would therefore suggest that action on the War Cabinet&apos;s decision should he ? for the moment.

A departmental Minute is attached recording the action taken regarding Mr. J.P. Whitaker.

MINUTE.

A good deal of irritation and annoyance has been caused in Belgian circles by the publication, in the "Times" and "Daily Mail", of a series of articles by a Mr. J.P. Whitaker, describing his experiences during two and a half years in the occupied zones of France, and his escape via Belgium during which he visited Antwerp and Brussels for a few days. The description of economic conditions in Belgium is hold to be inaccurate and misleading, since these conditions are represented as almost normal, while Flemish Belgium is said to be treated by the Germans with "Gentleness".

Monsieur Carton de Wiart has written to the press saying, at considerable length, that the articles on Belgium have caused profound distress. Mr. H. Hoover, President of the relief Commission, has written to the Commission saying that after two and a half years&apos; intimate knowledge of the circumstances he can "declare without reserve that the observations and conclusions of Mr. Whitaker give an entirely false impression of the conditions existing in Belgium".

The Belgian press published in this country has contained vigorous articles denouncing the statements made by Mr. Whitaker which will, they say, doubtless be reproduced with joy by the Germans. They also give particulars of actual conditions in occupied Belgium.

H.M&apos;s Minister at Havre reports that the Belgian Minister has spoken to him on the matter, and fears that the statements made may produce a wholly erroneous and most unfortunate impression.
At Lord -U Cecils instruction, Llra 7iMtaker has been seen by Xiord St- Percy, who records his &quot;opinion that HLIra IJlii taker&apos;s &quot; s tat cm ont s are perfectly correct, though Ms. deductions are. &quot;erroneous&quot;.   Mru HooverTs letter has &quot;boon sent to tho entire press, hut the &quot;&apos;2imesn did not publish it.It is worthy of note that 11?* &apos;,!h.itaker has an identity card, issued by the Municipal Authorities of Croiir-Iille and stamped &quot;by tho Gorman &quot;Btappen-Sommandatur&quot;, on which he is described as of &quot;lationalito anglaiso&quot;, and that ho was in possession of a British Passport issued at the Soroign Office in Soptombor 1914; whereas ho stated in one of his articles that the German Authorities did not know that ho was English but had (on one occasion at least) mistaken him for an American.   Ho does not appear to have &quot;been interned or sub-footed to any special restrictions while in the-areas occupied by tho Gorman Military.A copy of Sir ;?c Yilliors1 Despatch (abovo referred to) is being sent confidentially to the Editor of tho t,fj?imes&quot; and its contents will bo conveyed to other suitable press representatives.(Initialled)   M.N.I;12th April, 1917,
