WAR CABIFET, -fZIOHISM AND TEE SUGGS STEP^3JiJ4f?i5l5?ir.t9.?-&quot; ISGYBT1AK &quot;IdTPEDITI0 ahy, FORCE .Having followed fairly closely the operations of the Zionist Movement during the years immediately proceeding and also subsequent to the outbreak of the war, I should like to submit a few considerations on the possibility cf military co-operation with us hy Jewish Nationalists all over the world.Jewish colonization in Palestine may be divided in four distinct periods..1870 - 1683       Individual Effort.1883 - 1899       Alliance Israelite (EdwardeRothschild) Period, 1699 - 1908       Jewish Colonisation Association(Baron Hirssh Trust) Period. 1908 Zionist or Nationalist Period.Until the founding of the Jewish National Fund, by the.Zionist Congress at the Hague, and the immigration organizations such as the Palestine Bureau (Jaffa), the Anglo-Palestine Bank, and the Zideron Jacob Agricultural Training College for Jewish Colonists under Mr, Aaron Aaronson, Jewish recolonization cannot be said to have been either successful or to be upon a sound economic basis.Since 1908 the annual number uf immigrant Jewish settlers has shown a distinct increase, and the agricultural and social conditions of the colonies have shown a remarkable improvement.      The Nationalists realized that their hupe of restoring a Jewish home in Palestine was bound up with, re--creating- a new typo of Jewish society based upon the soil and upon actual agricultural production in lieu of the previous dependence on charity coupled with profits arising from trading with their neighbours-     Side by side with the agricultural development,  came the restoration of the Hebrew language as the medium of Education in Jewish schools and as the common language of the colonists.      Also the foundation of the artistic workshops,  carpentering, and plastic handier-..;.::&quot;is associated in Palestine with the Bazalel foundation at Jerusalem.As an example of the growth in recent years let us take the operations/of the Zionist Bank in Palestine the Anglo-Palestine*Year of foundation &quot;            L&apos;c an s&apos;( francs) Deoo sits fees.)1903                         -               23 c, COO &quot;&quot;38-3,000-   1908                                     4.000.COO 3.000.0001912                                      7/300,^)00 6/768/000The changes in the character of Zionist activity in Palestine have been recent and rapid, and   only recent experience can enable us to judge cf its significance and strength,.      The condition of the Jewish Colonies ten years ago is very   different from the conditions just before the outbreak of war.
We must now turn to the position of Zionism in tne various countries of the worlds     Zionist affairs were con-trolled &apos;h? the -Central Zionist Committee&apos;1,     In 1911 4isir office moved, to Berlin     In 1914 the.

Copenhagen, but the- Committee scattered and tho real control and centre of tie Zionist movement was effeotivoly, thougli not officially, transferred to America.jlvon since the war. Zionism has boon &quot;gathering-strength,,among the three million Jews in ul-SJU (there are 5005000 Jews in the British Isles., 100 000 in France. 150.000 in Morocco, and Russia     five millions)/,     In Justice Brando is of Chicago, they obtained a. leader of note,, ability and character,  &apos; At the &quot;big Jewish Cor  res s at Hiiladelphia ill March, 1916. the Zionists consolidated their position end in the subsequent dealings with the hon-Zionist American Jewish Committee (louls Maa-shall:. Z$rzv&amp; Adler &amp; Co.) they were able to obtain the effective predominance in the policy of organised Judaism throughout the States *Before the war, it is icJ/l to deny that the almost natural trend of Jewish political feelings, &quot;both Zionist Jew and International, or AssimuLlaiiorhst Jew, was anti-Kussia, and consequently,, though to a less extent anti the Allies of Russia, the Zionist Jew, &quot;but not the Assimi-lailonist Jew was almost equally anti^German, and in spite of the clover and assiduous&apos; German propa^arda put about   &quot;by the German General. Staff, the nationalist Jews have always known that the greatest stronghold of philosophy?; and social anti-Semitism is Prussia.     As regards France, the memory of the ureyfas ease dies hard.     On asking Jews way their co-religionists so mistrusted the French   Government and dreaded French influence in PalestineI,received on more than one occasion the mono-verbal reply, TiBreyfusVi0    Beyond this, is the feeling so prevalent in the Arah mind also that the freneh are an assimilating people;   I0e3they must turn people into &quot;Frenchmen or drive them out;    and gust as the example of  unir is &quot;know throughout the   East, so the Jew knows that his efforts to build up a new Jewish nation from the soil of Palestine. with Zehrow as its first language&quot;and Arahio as its second would &quot;be thwarted by the IrencruIt is difficult to analyse why precisely the Zionists have become more and more pro^British since the war and more and more&apos; anti-1&apos;urk and anti-C4erman7 &quot;but- I am convinced there is no doubt of tikis fact.Jemal Pasha-s bad treatment of the Jews in Palestine,, coupled with our good treatment of the Salestinian. refugees in Sgypt has had more than a little to do with it;   hut, talking as 1 did to various members of the Zionist organ!-sation in Cairo, I was struck &quot;by the far-sightedness of their views *     One of them&apos;said, -wWe supported-the Turkish revolution of 2.303 with money and organisation, hut we were wrong and henceforth we have done with the young Turks for ever and only a decent European Government; in PalestineI^okolctr Arthur HantkoDr.,Victor Jacobsou Dr,,   ehemaya Lo ouls(low in Copenhagen) [low in WScAb and in Sarisin the Autumn of 1916) (In ihigland)&apos;(Present whereahouts I have not hoen able to ascertain)

Lake Euleh and tho now G-alliloan colonies wero to bo in another sphere for economics, oven ho and his -friends would oppose such a demarcation . vehemently.:,     He, said that the northern boundary of Palestine was the Kbassigeh River, aid that everything south of this line, must.be in ono unit for economic as well as political purposes.     This would, of course., assist us in &quot;the Druse problemi     Tho Druses of Job el Euuran. who are tho traditional enemies of the Maronltas,and the Ironch are undor the Sykes-Picot agreement   included in tho .?tcnoh sphere,, and the line Akka - Bosra - Verdi represents no natural,political. or economic boundary that could possibly work in practice0 But this is but a side issuec     !&apos;he important point is that the Zionist loaders regard the success of   - - cur arms as tho only hope for Zionism, and at tho same time do not want to have the responsibility   of political control in Palestine,.     Iia:r  Jordan&quot;s recent articles (reprinted in Le pouplo Juif, January 1917&apos;) make this quite clear,     Tho political splash which was. made by the earlier Zionists like Hersl, alienated a largo number of influential Jews and put a great many others against the then proclaimed io;am of Zionism,,     low, Zionism is less complete in its demands * All it now. seeks is&apos; to gi^e the Jewish people freedom to settle in Palestine, acquire land, and build up industries and schools,   &apos; As ITordan writes, %-hey rill submit themselves entirely to whatever Government is established in tho country,.&apos;r     The Jews in   Cairo have been getting into touch with the Arab leaders, and nothing was mere remarkable than Puad Ketib1s (Phder-Soorotary for Poreign Affairs to -the King of the He;jaz) statement that he anticipated no difficulty with the Jews as,  &quot;hew we understand each otherV&quot;I heard a good deal in Cairo about Jewish troopsa Aaronsen said ho could got 1,000 really good Palestinians.     . Jotrs now in Egypt5 -   Ee thought America and Morocco might help   as well as Whitechapel and Stepney.     Bo expressed the view that tho moral of c. Jewish Brigade entering Palestine would be wonderful, and emphasised tho importance   of getting in people like Herman Bentwich, now in the Gamol Transport Corps, as officers, -A word as to the effect ef tho Russian Revolutionf It is significant that tho Poalo. Zionists, ice* the Revolution-ary and Socialist Zionist organisation of Russian-Jews in Russia held a big conference as r ec oil thy as October, 1915, at which the two first resolutions were(1) To agitate among the Jewish-masses that tho only solution of the Jewish problem is tho creation of a Jewish home in Palestine.(2) To do everything possible to increase the income of tho Palestine fund (vide above).As to the distribution-of Zionist feeling, I cannot
do &quot;hotter than quo to- from tho writings of Dr JRnppin, tho head of the Palestine Immigration Bureau^ in Jaffa, who was last year deported by Jomal Pasha *     He writes, &quot;The enthusiasm which Zionism has aroused, varies very much in different countriesn     It finds most ardent support in Russia and afterthat in the United States of America, and South Africa, A considerable amount 121 Roumania and Gclicia,     On the other hand, it makos slow headway in other parts of Austria, Hungary^ It lily and ovon England-   and wins still fewer adherents in Germany 7. Holland and. France 3 TTI might add that Junkerizod German Jows like Paul Hathan are the most strenuous oponents ci Zionism-,Another important conference is to bo hold, I believe, this month in Washington.. I)- 0 r;, by the American Jows and it is to America wc -should turn to watch tho currents and cioss currents of tho Zionist movement in all its aspects at this moment.     In Russia it would appear that tho Jews are taking tho extreme lino, pre &quot;Deb ly in, hopes of splitting Russia into fragments, after the to them intolerable weight   of a great centralized Hostile liass,     &apos;( Sgda) W,, ORHSB Y GORE14th April,..1917
