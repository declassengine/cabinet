SECRET. G.T. 450WAR CABINET.Brig.General Fairholme, Military Attache, Athens.Hote on a conversation with M. Venizelos. 23rd March, 1917.Asked how he thought things were going as regards the progress of his movement, he said he had to complain of a certain amount of persecution of his adherents in Old Greece, hut that he is not going to do anything to force matters there while the present agreement between the Entente Government and the Royalist Government continued in force.At one time he would have liked the Bowers to act more dras-tically towards the present regime at Athens, but now he recognises that it will be best for him to keep quiet until the war between the Great Powers;isrover and that the creation of a new &quot;front&quot; in Greece would have been a strategical error.When the war is over, if Germany should be the winner, which he considers out of the question, King Constantine would be para-mount in Greece and would govern as an autocrat.    It;would then be best for the country for Venizelos and his principal supporters to efface themselves.But if, as he anticipates the Entente Powers win the war, then he declared emphatically, &quot;King Constantine will have to go&quot; and a liberal regime would be instituted.Speaking of the Provisional Government forces M. Venizelos deplored that the means of equipping the second and third divisions are not being provided yet.   He said that these divisions, the former recruited in Crete, the latter in Mitylene and other islands, are made up of finer material than the first division, which is now fighting on the Vardar.front, and giving a good account of itself.(This latter statement was confirmed by General Sarrail,. who told me that he is quite satisfied with them. They have had some fighting and have suffered some Hisses).(Ind.)     W.E.F.Salonika.25th March 1917.
