j^is the. Property of His BrtonjcJWaiestVs Government.]Sprinted for the use of the Cabinet   April 1917,272THE FISHING INDUSTRY.BEFORE the war the average quantity of fish, as distinguished from shell-fish, annually landed by fishing-vessels in the United Kingdom was .1,000,000 tons.Of this 1,000,000 tons, 40 per cent, was exported. The remaining 600,000 tons was consumed in the United Kingdom. Roughly speaking, this amount equals one-third of the annual meat consumption.In 1916 the landings of fish have fallen to 400,000 tons, thus reducing- the quantity available for home consumption by one-third, and allowing nothing for export.With the reduced number of fishing-vessels and the diminished crews it becomes very important to maintain, and if possible to increase, this output.The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries thinks that much greater quantities of fish could be brought in if a market were assured. This is especially true of mackerel, pilchards, and herrings, of which, at certain seasons, in certain localities, there is often a glut.Acting through the Fish Committee, and supplementing rather than supplanting the existing channels of trade distri bution, the Board wishes to be able to obtain the greatest possible output of fish, and secure that the fish shall either reach the consumer immediately or be preserved for future use. For these purposes the Board asks to be placed in such a financial position as to be able to employ fish merchants to handle the fish for them; to employ or subsidise curers either for light curing or for more permanent forms of preservation ; to employ or subsidise canners to tin surplus supplies and hold them at the Governments disposal; to rent cold storage, when the occasion, arises, in which to hold fish; to hire motor carriers to collect fish ; to purchase boxes and other receptacles, ice, salt, &amp;c, in order to secure the supply of these necessaries wherever required ; to hire suitable empty buildings, sheds, &amp;c, where it appears to be desirable, in order to provide smoking accommodation ; and generally to take such steps as the occasion demands to utilise our fish supply to the best possible advantage.In order to carry out these objects the Board asks that the Treasury should advance money, 10,00()L at a time, up to a limit of, say, 100,000?..
