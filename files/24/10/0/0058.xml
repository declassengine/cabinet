.IT0./6214,IG.T,iiiEEElAL WAR CABINET .Enlistment of United. States Citizens in the CanaclianExpeditionary Force . 2^ITote by the Secretary of State for --varThe Judge-Advocate General;states with further reference to his areyiou3 Minute (jee G.T. 422) - &quot;From our conference with Sir George Perley today, I gather that men of the Canadian Expeditionary Force are enlisted as members of the Canadian Militia under the Canadian Militia Act and not as soldiers of the regular forces under the Arrny Act .Upon this assunption,  I am of opinion that the validity of their enlistment depends upon Canadian law, and thus, if Section 23 of the Canadian Militia Act is altered,  so as to dispense with the necessity of taking the oath set out in that section, the enlistment would be Talid without taking this oath.DERBY.h April, 1917.
