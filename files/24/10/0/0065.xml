caITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AND INI)DSTSIAL POLICY.^^p^report on the importation of goods; jallo^^om the present enemy countriesafter the war.To the Right Honourable H. H. Asquith, K.C., M.P., Prime Minister.Sir,1. We have the honour to report that at the commencement of the task entrusted to us by our Terms of Reference, our attention has been drawn to the widespread desire for some early and definite statement of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the treatment of imports into the United Kingdom from the present enemy countries in the period immediately following the conclusion of the War; and we have, therefore, thought it advisable to take this matter into our immediate consideration.2. In so doing, we have had before us the Resolutions bearing on this matter which were adopted by the Economic Conference at Paris, and the views oi, the Departmental Committees appointed by the Board of Trade to consider the position of certain important branches of British industiy after the War; and we have also had the advantage of evidence from the Board of Trade and Board of Customs and Excise on some of the administrative questions involved. I3. The Resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, which are specially relevant to the point now under consideration, are included in the &quot; Transitory Measures for the Period of Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural, and Maritime Reconstruction of the Allied Countries&quot; and are as follows : ; 1; \;^&quot; Whereas the War has put an end to all the Treaties of Commerce between the Allies and the Enemy Powers, and whereas it is of essential importance that, during the period of economic reconstruction which will follow the cessation of hostilities, the liberty of none of the Allies should be hampered by any claim put forward by the Enemy Powers to most-favoured-nation treatment, the Allies agree that the benefit of this treatment shall not be granted to those Powers during a number of years to be fixed by mutual agreement among themselves.&quot;During this number of years the Allies undertake to assure to each&apos; other, so far as possible, compensatory outlets for trade in case consequences&quot; detrimental to their commerce result from the application of the undertaking; referred to in the preceding paragraph.&quot;&quot;In order to defend their commerce, their industry, their agriculture^ and their navigation against economic aggression resulting from dumping-or any other mode of unfair competition, the Allies decide.to fix by agreement a period of time during which the commerce of the Enemy Powers shall be submitted to special treatment, and the goods originating in their countries shall be subjected either to prohibitions, or to a special regime of an effective character. &apos;&quot; The Allies will determine, by agreement through diplomatic channels, the special conditions to be imposed during the above-mentioned period oh the ships of the Enemy Powers.5&apos; ...    -(105O8r-14.)

4 The fact that the Resolutions of the Economic Conference have been approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government ma;kes it unnecessary for us toMiscuss the principle-of the differential treatment of imports from the present eneiny countries during the Reconstruction Period, and enables us to assume that for a substantial period after the conclusion of hostilities His Majesty&apos;s Government will decline to enter into anv arrangement which would deprive them of complete freedom to treat goods from those countries in such a manner as they might deem expedient at any given time.5. Pending the evolution of a scheme for the settlement of the general com-mercial policy of the country after the War, upon which we are at present engaged, it appears to us that a definite announcement on the limited matter dealt with in our present report would be generally welcome, having regard to (a) the widespread feeling that the military operations of Germany during the War, and the seizures of plant and materials in the occupied territories, have been largely directed towards delaying the economic recovery of the Allies after the War, and that strong counter-measures may properly be taken; (&amp;) the fact that it is reasonable to assume that some of the German industries to which the United Kingdom market was important before the War, and which are now threatened by British competition developed during the War, will adopt every possible measure to overthrow that competition and to re-establish their position; and (c) the advisability of giving British industry as much security as possible during the period of transition from war to normal peace conditions.6. Further, a definite and public decision on this particular matter appears to be immediately practicable, since it does not seem to us necessarily to raise any of the difficult and delicate questions as to the commercial relations of the United Kingdom with&quot; the British Dominions beyond the Seas, nor the terms of our Treaties with our Allies and with present Neutrals, which are involved in the consideration of the general problem. We believe, also, that there will be little difference of opinion amongst the people of the United Kingdom upon the policy involved during the Transitory Period. Many questions affecting general trade policy will have to be considered and dealt with. These will be the subject of the Committees delibera-tions without any avoidable delay, and the recommendations which are now put forward are not to be regarded as committing us to any special line of policy beyond the period to which they refer.7. On careful consideration of the whole matter, we are of opinion that the procedure of prohibition, subject to licence in exceptional cases, is likely to be most efficient, as it will certainly be the most readily applicable, immediately on the con-clusion of the War. It involves, of course, a system of Certificate of Origin for goods not of present enemy production, but it would presumably not be necessary to require such certificates in the case of all classes of goods imported into the United Kingdom, or of goods from all countries. We think it would be sufficient if Consular Certificates of Origin were required in respect of all goods imported from European countries (with the possible exception of present Allies, if satisfactory arrangements could be made), and declarations (subject to challenge by the Customs) were required from importers in the case of goods from other foreign countries.8. We recognise that there would probably be special cases in which it would be advisable to allow the importation of goods of present enemy origin, and in the event of the system of prohibition being adopted it would be necessary for some Department of Government to be vested with the power to grant licences for such importation, it being understood that such licences would be granted only in cases where the Department was satisfied that importation was essential in the national interest and that the licences would be subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Department might think proper to impose.9. There remains the question of the duration of this system. The Resolution of the Paris Economic Conference, already quoted, contemplates a period to be fixed by agreement among the Allies. Whatever the ultimate decision as to the duration of the differential treatment of enemy goods may be, we are of opinion that the period of prohibition should be at least 12 months, and His Majestys Government should retain full liberty to prolong the period to whatever extent may be found expedient.   The existence of the power to license would make it possible
to mitigate the regime gradually, and thereby to prepare the way for the substitu-tion of tariff treatment: for prohibition; :should that course be thought advisable, in the later stages of. the Reconstruction Period.10. We, therefore, recommend that the present regime, whereby importation of goods of enemy origin is prohibited, should be continued, subject to licence in exceptional cases, for a&apos;period of at least 12 months after the conclusion of the War, and subsequently for such further perioTd as His Majesty&apos;s Government may deem expedient.11. In subsequent Interim Reports we propose to deal with the question of the treatment of exports to enemy countries and with the problem of Shipping, as to which we are awaiting the Report of the Committee on Shipping and Shipbuilding appointed by the Board of Trade.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient servants, ,(Signed)      BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH (Chairman).

We do not consider it to be practicable at this time, even if it were, thought desirable, to fix any definite duration of the period of general prohibition, and we are of opinion that it must be left to His Majesty&apos;s Government to determine when the prohibition should cease.(Signed)     RHONDDA.JOSEPH PATON MACLAY, ARTHUR F. PEASE.
. Memorandum by Sir Alfred Booth.I regret that I am not able to sign the above Report for the following reasons :-1. Prohibitions of imports from enemy countries, except as a\continuation - for a very short time of the war regime, could not in practice be insisted on as a condition of peace. If satisfactory terms can be secured in every other respect, including disarmament and indemnities,-it is difficult to suppose that the country would be willing to go on fighting for prohibition alone. There can belittle doubt that our Allies would be opposed to such a policy.2. Prohibition of imports could not be maintained effectively for such a long period as is recommended in the Report. The premium on evasion would be too high, and it is adhiittedthat the best system of Certificates of Origin cannot be made watertight.3. The Report admits that prohibition could not he made absolute but should be qualified by a system of permits to import under licence. There are grave commercial and political objections to a system whereby the power to grant- licences would be entrusted to a Government depart-ment. If it is intended that Parliament should determine what articles should be exempt from the prohibition and under what con-ditions their importation should be allowed, then the recommendation of a licensing system is&apos;merely an evasion of the difficulty.4. No attempt has been made by the Committee; to examine what effect a regime of. prohibition Of imports&apos;from enemy countries would have either on our general home trade or; on our general export trade. Such an examination might-result in.the rejection of the policy in our own interests.5. My conclusion, therefore, is that general prohibition of imports from enemy countries during the period of reconstruction should be rejected, except as a possibly necessary stepping stone from the regime of war to the regime of peace, and that it is now: the business of the Com-mittee to examine the details of-our export and import trade with enemy countries with a view to determining to what extent the objects of the Paris Economic Conference, in so far as they relate to the period of Reconstruction, can be attained by means of a tariff.(Signed)     A. A. BOOTH.Memorandum by Mr. Hewins.I dissent from this interim Report. I think that the general prohibition, tempered with licences, of enemy trade after the War is impracticable. Differentia-tion against enemy trade would include the prohibition of particular articles, but it is not possible to formulate this policy with sufficient definiteness for action until some decision is reached upon the policy to be adopted with regard to the Dominions, the Allies, and neutral countries.November 10th, 1916.(Signed)     W. A. S. HEWINS.
