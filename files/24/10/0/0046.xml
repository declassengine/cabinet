The United States have already coroeto the financial assistance of the Allies, a large proportion of their first war-loan is earmarked forthis purpose; and we may hope that they will in future share with us the burden of maintaining French. Italian and Russian credit.      It is also a good omen that theythe Argentine, if such pressure should be neeaed to make the Argentine Government more accommodating on the ques-tion of wheat-exports.     Finally, the American Navy has already begun to police the trade-routes of the Western Atlantic.should have agreed to support us in a coal-boycott of
-   2   -Other forms of co-operation are. being discussed in London and Washington.    _H.il. doverment have not hesi-tated to make a number of practical suggestions.   They have asked for instance that America should join with us   (a) to control the movements of neutral shipping by attaching conditions to the supply of American coal and insurance facilities;    (b) to check the undesirable activities of neutral banks and traders by threatening them with a financial boycott;    (c) to control imports from overseas into the Scandinavian countries.   We have also suggested   (d) that American petroleum should be made, like British coal, a prohibited export which neutrals will only be allowed to receive if they con-form, within reasonable limits, to our blockade policy. But for the moment it is by   (e) finding ships for Allied trades that the United States can help us most materially.    We have asked Mr. Wilson:-To utilise without delay the German and Austrian shipping which he controls (682,392 tons gross).To divert American vessels from coastal and lake trades to the ocean routes (over 1,000,000 tons gross).To build new ships as rapidly as possible, and to supply British shipyards with steel.To procure the rejection of the proposed amend-ment of the Shipping Bill which, if carried, would postpone the delivery of the ships for which we have contracted with American yards.There are some difficult questions to be settled before complete cooperation in any of these matters can be secured.     The greatest difficulties will pro-bably arise over the control of American exports to
-   2   -neutral European countries which adjoin the enemy. It will take months to establish such a control unless the United States can be persuaded to utilise not only our intelligence services, but also our blockade machinery;   yet it will not be easy for them to accept the help of our machinery without abandoning some of the readings of international law which they have defended in the past, and without appearing to delegate gome of their sovereign rights to us.    But with good -will on both sides, even these difficulties should be overcome.fhe effect of American intervention upon the neutral European powers should in the end by consider-able.   Tne United States, acting in close concert with ourselves, can apply pressure to Scandinavia, Holland, Spain, Switzerland and Greece by withholding, whenever it seems desirable, not only coal and mineral oil, but also cereals, fertilisers, fodder-stuffs, cotton and eopper.   Assistance of this kind may soon be required to settle our difficulties with Spain respecting tonnage and iron-ore;   for the Spanish Government have suddenly! recalled the Marquis de Cortina when he was on the point of signing an Agreement with H.M. Government which was thought to be equally advantageous for Great Britain and for Spain,     It will also be easier to deal with Sweden, if the United States will threaten her with an embargo on American products. We appear to have secured&apos; 1 , &quot;-.    --     , - &apos; 1   --- &apos; \  jthe release of the Allied tonnage in the Baltic by holding up the Swedish grain-ships^    But this bargain disposes of our best woapon against Sweden;   and if further facilities for Russian transit are to be

Denmai*k or Holland to make any sudden reduction of their exports to the enemy.   The Sovern-ments of these countries are in mortal fear of German invasion;   and neither we nor the United States can guarantee to protect them.     Norway moreover has stocks in hand of cereals and of the other articles which she normally obtains from America.    Minor concessions might be demanded from Denmark and Holland;   the U.S.A. might require them to make gradual reductions of their agricultural exDorts to Germany, without diminishing similar exports to the United Kingdom.   Holland might also be forced to reconsider her attitude on the sub-ject of armed merchantmen.     But it is. difficult to judge how far demands of this kind can be pressed v?ith-out exposing the two countries to a German attack.There can be no doubt that the Scandinavian countries are nervous as to their future relations with the United States, on whom hitherto they have counted to keep the British blockade within limits.   The unex-pected complaisance of the new Swedish Ministry to Great Britain is highly-significant.   Admiral Lindraan , who wrecked the Anglo-Swedish negotiations in 1915, is now clearly anxious to come to a lasting settlement
