MINISTRY OF PENSIONS. REPORT FOR PERIOD FROM 7th APRIL to 1.3th APRIL 1917.1.       The Royal Warrant and Order in Council have been communicated to the Admiralty and War Office for promulgation to the Navy and Army respectively.   In the course of the week the Order in Council appeared in extenso in various newspapers.Recent discussions in the Press on the subject of the Royal Warrant have resulted as was anticipated in the receipt of an abnormal number of letters and claims with regard to pensions.   On the morning of the 11th some 13,000 communications were received at the Award to Soldiers Branch of the Ministry at Chelsea.   Notices have now been published in the Press and have been sent for exhibition at Post Offices explaining the manner in which&apos;re-assessment is made and arrears paid and that no risk of loss is incurred by those not making applications.A special section has been ereated in the Award to Soldiers&apos; Branch for the express purpose of dealing with formerly rejected applications for pensions, and in the Award, to Widows and Dependants&apos; Branch for the purpose of dealing with the re-assessment of dependants.   As was stated in last week&apos;s report the re-assessment of M&amp;orc^s pensions is being carried out at the Pension Issue Office and will be completed on the expiration of the 13 weeks for which postal draft books were issued after the order for re-assessment was given (i.e. a fortnight before the coming into force of the Royal Warrant on the 4th April).Appendix 1 shows the effect of the Warrant on the few dependants&apos; pensions that have been re-assessed.   34 out of 38 parents benefit to the extent of 3/2d. a week on the average while In 4 cases the old pension was equal tothe
MlAppendix II shows.-the progress made with-tlm.further examination into entitlement under the new conditions.     Out of 98 widows 87 previously refused pension have now bocn admitted under either Article 11 or Article&apos; 15 of the new Warrant and in 114 cases of aggravation pensions have been granted instead of gratuities.     Out of 41 dependants&apos;V cases 37 have been admitted for pension or gratuity.2. The agitation in favour of pensions for life to mendischarged from the Army on account of disability neither attributable to nor aggravated by their military service, which has been conducted with vigour by Mr. Hogge, M.P. resulted in some hostility being shown towards tho Minister of Pensions at a meeting with his constituents in the Blackfriars division of Glasgow on the 12th instant.     It hardly seems to be yet realised that in overy case in which there has been any aggravatior of a manls disability owing to his military service he will receive a full pension and it wild only be in those casas in which.on re-examination the disability Is found not to be in any way due to service, that a gratuity will be given in place of a pension.3,. A Report on the work of the Statutory Committeefor the week ending 11th instant Is annexed as Appendix III. In further instances, the unsatisfactory result of and the difficulties arising from the transfer to Class Wf of men not in a fit state to resume and remain at theirformer employment.Training Schemes were approved for Nottingham,Dumfriesshire and Y/alsall.There is evidence in the press that the Bristol V/ar Pensions Committee are working energetically to secure training and employment for all diaabled men in their area. 4, This week has been spent by the Minister andParliamentary Secretary in visiting and inspecting various Institutions connected with the treatment and training ofdisabled
-dissLbX^wL-meri in Scotland, and-in explaining the provisions of the new Warrant for this treatment and training   and with regard to Pensions to Local Committees and others in that Country.On the 9th instant, the Minister visited the Tuberculosis Sanatorium and Colony at Hairmyers about 9 miles from Glasgow.   This Institution was designed to form part of the Lanarkshire County Authority5s Scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis and it was proposed that the persons admitted should undertake graded labour of a character suitable to their condition and at the same time be trained in the different occupations connected with work on the land so that they would be fitted to follow and obtain their living from an out-door life in tha future. In connection with the Hairmyers Sanatorium and Colony, the Lanarkshire County Council also contemplated the afforestation of some 3,000 acres at Camps some 35 miles from Glasgow.   The completion of the buildings At Hairmyers has been delayed on account of the war, but by arrangements made with the War Office it is hoped to have them finished during the summer when there will be accommodation for 200 patients.   The Distriot of the Middle Ward of the County of Lanarkshire who were responsible for the Schemes, have now placed the Hairmyers Sanatorium and the Camps Forestry Station at the disposal of Local Naval &amp; Military Wat, Pensions Committees for disabled men.   They assume that probably not more than .100 of these men will require tc be accommodated at one time which would leave half the space available for the ordinary patients of the Colony, but they have stated that even if the whole Institution woro required for disabled   men they do not censidor that thoro would be any objection in tho circumstances to this beingarranged
arranged and the temporary acquisition., of&quot; th^-Inst! tut ion by trie Government would obviate any question or difficulty-being raised by the ratepayers.On the 10th instant the Minister visited Erskine House Hospital for limbless soldiers recently acquired by the Glasgow Corporation.   There is accommodation there for 200 patients and huts are being provided for a further 200.   As stated in last week5s Report,, 99 cases were admitted and 93 discharged from this Hospital during themonth of March.On the same day the Minister attended a Meeting of the Local War Pensions Committees of Scotland at which 35 out of 44 of these Committees were represented.   The Meeting was presided over by the Lord Provost and it was resolved that it was advisable to divide Scotland into four areas for the purpose of instituting Schemes fcr the health, training and employment,of disabled men; that tho areas should be the South West of Scotland, the South East of Scotland, the Centre of Scotland and the North pf Scotland, the limits to be adjusted in consultation with the Minister; that Joint Committees for these Districts should be appointed at Meetings of representatives of tho Local Committees to be held at Edinburgh, Glasgcw, Aberdeen, Dundee or Perth; and that these Joint Committees, when appointed, should submit to the Local Committees proposals for treatment/ training and employment in the largor areas.On 10th instant also, the Minister received deputations from the Lanarkshire Miners and from tho Hamilton Local War Pensions Committee and discussed with these deputations various matters relating to pensions. 5.      Table I shows that 7,387 pensions includingChildren&apos;s
Children^ Allowances were granted during the week against 10,716 during the previous week and 9,501 in the week before that, the falling off being due to suspension of work during the Easter Holidays.   From the commencement of the War up to the 11th April, 584,687 pensions including Children&apos;s Allowances have been-awarded.Table II shows that during the last week 197 grants of Supplementary Pensions and Temporary-Allowances were made by the Statutory Committee against 219 in. the previous week and that the total number to date is 3260.6.        Table III shows the Staff cf the Ministry on the 11th April 1917.   It has been increased by 37 during the week and now consists of 196 men and 2,539 women, or 2,735 in all, the addition being mainly in the women clerks in the Award to Soldiers Branch.Returns recently prepared for the Treasury show that 2,536 out of this total receive wages under 40/- a week. No adults have less than 25/- and not less than 30/** is paid to every woman after a short probationary period.   Of 199 persons drawing over 40/- a week, 57 have salaries above  200 per annum including 15 above  500.The staff of the Statutory Committee remains at 72 men and 162 women or 234 in all, bringing up the gross total to 2,969.The daily absence owing to the measles epidemic in the female staff at Tate Gallery increased during the week from 13*2 to 13*4 per cent of the total.   The absence percentage at Chelsea went down from.6*6 to 3*4 and that of the Pensions Issue Office from 7*9 to 5*2, those reductions being no doubt largely due to the Easter Holidays on account of which all except a small emergency staff were absent for four days.   Advantage was taken of this absence thoroughly to dense Tate Gallery and it Is hepod the epidemic there will now die down.M. N.13th April 1917.
