SECRET&apos; fel  CABINET.C-.T. 429&quot;Attitude..of the French Government in purchasing; Spanish Tonnage; upon which, we were relying to bring ore toUnited Kingdom.n( Copy of Letter from Sir J. jiaclay to-Dr.- Addison .) Circulated to War Cabinet for Information.MINISTRY OE SHIPPING. 10th April, 1917Pear Dr. Addison.,The attitude cf the Erench Government towards the purchase of neutral tonnage has been causing us .grave anxiety, for some time past.. ,-. Per many weeks we have been endeavouring to come to an arrangement for preventing unnecessary, competition between the Allies, which has had the effect of raising prices in the neutral market to an unheaid of level, but it has hitherto proved impossible to make headway&apos;owing .solely to the obstructive attitude adopted by the Erench government.     Matters have reached a climax to-day, news halving just reached me that the very imp or-tant and delicate negotiations which;  as you are aware, we have been carrying on with-the Spanish Government in connection with the Ore question, are likely to be rendered fruitless by the action of Erench interests in purchasing and chartering a large number (said to&apos;amount-to 59,000 tons, in &apos;all) of.the very ships on which we are relying to bring-ore here, and to carry to Spain the coal without which the Spanish Government will not allow the ore to be exported.   . The situation appears to me to call for strong action and it Is suggested for your consideration that intimation should at once be&quot;.conveyed to the Erench Government that,  in view of the above-facts, it is- impossible for this country to continue the. supply of Steel to Prance.     We are considering independently the - withdrawal of British ships from French service, but that will not compensate for the loss, of the Spanish ore ships.Yours faithfully, .(Signed)    J..P, MACLAY.
