G. T. 440IN MEDICAL SERVICES.lierjorandum. relating- to the case of the -medical service! with v/hich&apos; the.Local Government Board is cbneerned.1.   The, administrative medical services with which the Local Government Board are concerned are those of the public health authorities, who appoint Medical Officers of Health,., both, for-inland districts and for Ports,with the duties,of safeguarding the. public health of the district, preventing.the importation of disease from abroad, and preventing the spread of infectious disease,including tuberculosis.   For the latter purpose, special officers (Tuberculosis Officers) are. appointed, with -the duties of organising and supervising- the work of,the authoritynfor the treatment of thi3 disease.Tuberculosis Officers- are also employed- largely in clinical work, and are responsible for the clinical examin-at ion.and treatment of large- numbers of patients.    In most -cases they assist the military- authorities in the examina-tion of reefcuits suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis.... The &quot;institutional medical services with which the Board are concerned are those .of poor law infirmaries,h.ospit-als for infectious diseases, Sanatoria for tuberculosis,; beds provided in-hospitals for treatment ofEenereal disease, maternity and infant welfare-centres, and hospital beds pro-vided for maternity and infant cases.     The tuberculosis sanatoria provide treatment at the present time for many munition workers and large numbers of discharged soldiers and sailors.&apos; :&apos;i   1   S::&apos;b: &apos; -3.   The domiciliary medical services with which the Board are chiefly concerned are those for the treatment of persons, who receive Outdoor Medical Relief.4.   With regard.to all these services, the Boardrs information is.that they have been reduced by the demands of the T/ar Office to an extent which already gives some ground for apprehension.     It is unnecessary to point out that the health of the civil population, and especially its freedom from communicable disease, which is liable to spread rapidly, is vital to the Country!s existence at a time when the majority of men and women in this.country are engaged on the production of munitions or ot&amp;er national work.   The War lias led to the development of many conditions which foster the.spread -of epidemics of infectious disease, especially the unavoidable overcrowding of munition and other special workers in certain areas, and the distribution of troops who have returned from the various fronts,where exotic diseases are-present.,, among the population.   The difficulties have been seriously increased by &apos;.the fact thai; the staff of trained, inspectors of nuisances has been greatly reduced by enlistment, and also by the diversion to the needs of the-Army of hospital accommodation which was -provided for the civil- population.
5.   In view of these considerations, the Board at the outset of, the war arranged with the war Office that no medical &amp;*h holding a post -under a iocal authority should he released for military service without their consent-. They.have reviewed all applications for commissions in the R.A,k.C, which have been referred td them by the War Office or the Central Idedieal.il/ar. Committee,, and have been able, by arranging for other medical men to undertake additional duties, to agree to the release of a large number of medi-cal men hoicag public posts for military service.   In some instances, the Board have felt compelled to refuse their consent, where the release of a particular^officer would   -W have&apos;-/involved in their opinion too great a risk to the public health; ,   .6,   A large number of beds in Poor Law Institutions have been placed at the disposal of the Army Council for the accommodation of sick and wounded soldier?, and arrangements have recently been made for handing over an additional  / number of bed3 for this purpose, which will bring the total up to some 50,000.   In nearly eatery case the medical ot&amp;ft of the converted institution . ha3 been retained to attend the military patients, and it would generally be . impossible to dispense with the services of these doctors. The displaced civilian inmates have been transferred to. other Poor Law Institutions, and the necessity of keeping an adequate medical staff at these Institutions lias conse-quently been increased.   The Board,however, have not found it, necessary to refuse to release.for military service more ; than-28 Poor.Law doctors in the whole of England and Wales.7.   Serious dangers to the-health of young children are associated with the hot summer months,and, in view of the special importance Of conserving the lives and preserving the health of the infant population at the present time,.... the,Medical Officer1s Department, in each large town &quot; especially,, must be prepared to deal with any epidemics of enteritis (summer diarrhoea) that may arise in July,August or September.   :   -8.    The chief communicable diseases (.such as enteric fever, diptheria,and 3carlet fever) which threaten the health of the civil population generally, including muni-tion workers, are apt. to be more prevalent during, the winter and autumn months.; ;.., Recent, experience .shows the great importance of measures for dealing&apos;with measles, which occurs chiefly in the earlier part of the year., .       &apos; ,9,   The Board are of opinion that sometMng could be done to relieve the present .pre33ure of work on the public medical services referred to,, and ,possibly;,t.o. release further men by moving medical Wen, whether those holding public posts or private practitioners, from one district -tomanother, and from one set of duties to another, or requiring them to perf orm,sdditional.&apos; duties; or to remain at their posts. .
10..   If any compulsory measure is proposed, the Beard would wish to be consulted in regard to it. They consider that their-consent should be required to the removal of any of the public medical officers referred to, a3 they are the only body who could properly determine whether the new arrangements proposed in particular cases would be satisfactory.11.   This memorandum does, not deal/With medical men in the School Medical Service,. who are under the control of the Board of Education, or with medical men&apos; in the Lunacy and kental Deficiency Services, who are under the Board of Control, or with medical men on the ,staffs of general hospitals, or with general-practitioners who are treating insured pers.on.s.12. References to medical men in; this Memorandum include medical women also.Local Government. Board, 5th.April,191&apos;7.&apos;
