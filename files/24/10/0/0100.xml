WAR,OFFICE SHIPBUILDING DEMANDS. -It is desired to draw attention to the heavy demands which the War Office is making at the present time on the shipbuilding resources of this country.Extensive orders were placed by the India Of floe early ijt 1916 for trgs, barges, hospital ships &amp;c., and asthese were urgently required, for servioe in Mesopotamia, the Admiralty assisted in their construction in every possible way bath in supply of laborr and materials andj furthermore,accepted delays in the Completion of Destroyers urgently required and under construction by Messrs Yarrow and by Messrs.Denny in order that these Firms might carry out work on vessels for Mesopotamia as well,The demands however continue to be heavy and have been seriously increased by those of tlie War Office for light draught vessels for the Inland Water Transport,    At the present time there are na less than 489 vessels in hand for the War Office, including tugs, stern wheelers, hospital barges, dumb barges, lighters, refrigerating barges, motor launches, &amp;c.   the amount of steel supplied for the War Office work, mostly for ship-bui3ding purposes, was about 4,000 tons for the last week of February as against 12,200 for the AdmiraHy.In order to prevent Shipbuilding Firms playing off one Government Department against another, it is desirable as a general principle to allocate the available Firms between the Departments and at a recent conference between Officers of the Admiralty,. Ministry of Shipping and of the War Office, it was proposed that 34 shipbuilding Firms should -&quot;he allocated to the War Office for the construction of the vessels required by them. Other shipbuilders are doing War Offioe work as vellr and the 34 Firms in question though generally small are capable of building tugs, trawlers, drifters and other small craft of the
types required by the Admiraltyi chiefly for anti-submarine purposes,The needs of the Admiralty ffcr such vessels are.urgent and extensive:   for instance,(a) It is clear that the rate at Which we are building trawlers is lamentably short bf requirements especially as the increasing mining activity on the part of the enemy is resulting in a most undesirable reductionof the trawlers available for patrol. Escort work is also becoming heavier. To enable the hydrophone to be used to the bestadvantage a large number of trawlers will have to bedevoted entirely to its use.In the opinion of the Admiralty a large increasein trawlers&quot;at the earliest possible moment is a matterof urgent importance, hut the output in. this oonntry is .as high as is obtainable unless other requirements arevery considerably reduced.(b) The position as regards the supply of tugs is also serious.The strain of war on the existing vessels has been very great and many of the older craft are rapidly wearing out:   very large additions have been required for service at the Fleet bases, and it has been necessary to take these from the commercial ports which are consequently in a depleted condition.Very heavy demands have had to be met in regard to damaged merchant ships and we are experiencing great difficulty in passing sailing vessels through the danger areas owing to want of towage.It is therefore a matter of real urgency to build tugs for Admiralty service as fast as possible.It is of supreme importance that the Admiraltyrequirements for small craft should be met in order to reduce ourshipping losses which are increasing and will continue toincrease, and, in. the opinion of the Admiralty, the War Officeprogramme of shipbuilding which is apparently indefinite andunlimited in. extent, and which obviously reduces the outputof small craft- for the Admiralty, should be submitted to theWar Cabinet for scrutiny and sanction, in the same way as is donewith regard to the Admiralty programme of Warship building.19th April, 1917.
