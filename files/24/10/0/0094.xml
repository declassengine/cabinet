Miliukoff, (with whom Ihad a long conversation last night) - not from my own pers-onality but from my position as Representative of theBritish Army., for uhich the continual growth of admirationin Russia, and the dependence upon the advice of BritishOfficers is most noticeable, -I beg that the safe delivery of this despatchbe acknowledged by telegraph,* I have the honour to be,Sir, -Your most obedient servant,(Sgd.) J, KAiTBURY &quot;^LLIIS,Chief of British Ililitary Mission, G,Ht Q.     Russia,
1st April 1917.Yesterday, morning the Chiefs of the Allied Military Missions called on the new Minister for War in his car at the station here, and the following is an account of the interview which, as it is historical, I give as fully as I can. As we took no notes we agreed to this arrangement in concert.M.Guchkoff, Minister for War in the present Government of Russia, received us at 12 noon on 31st. March 1917,He first thanked us Tor the great services&quot;we had rendered to Russia since the beginning of the war, and also during the sad circumstances through which we are now passing, and he had the conviction that we would continue to lend our previous aid to the Provisional Government.He had assembled us to lay before us the situation in such a manner as to consolidate our agreement in their action eventually, and also to show us in plain terms what the Russian Government can do and cannot do, so that our operations shouldV.&quot;,, - i ,&apos;1 v &apos;        &apos;.jbe clearly undertaken with an understanding of the possible efforts of the Russian Army..He then gave us an &quot;expose&quot; of the Revolution.When the Duma received the announcement of its dissolution, tumultous assemblies took place in the streets of Petrograd,   The Regiments called upon to maintain order did their duty but without enthusiasm,- it could be seen at once that this would not continue next day.The Revolution declared itself suddenly, there was no plotting for it.   No plot existed,   There were no leaders. The whole mass, - Army - Citizens, - populace,, arose as if magnetized by the oppression of the &apos;&apos;ancien regime&quot; of Autocracy. An excess of despotism, - obsessed by &quot;Nepotism&quot; - carried away by. the scandals of the Court.In the evening Guchkoff tried to get into touch v/ith the Military Commandant of Petrograd.,-
He could not find him. During the night he found that he had taken refuge with his family in the outskirts cf Petrograd.The situation was a very grave one.Petrograd contained about 150/160*000 men of reserve troops undergoing instruction.The troops were re-divided into regiments numbering .about 10/15,000 with 50 or 60 officers,&apos; mostly of auxiliary forces or more or less incapable officers, sent back from the front to the H.Q&apos;s of the Corps with a view to being given instruction.On the same evening the Duma drew up a telegram to the Emperor with a view of obtaining from him certain concess-ions - notably the constitution of a Liberal Ministry.The next day at a very early hour certain of the Petrograd regiments came and offered their services to the Duma. In the morning delegations of the regiments at Tsarskoe Selo and of the Emperor&apos;s escort and of the private police of Their Majesties camo and placed themselves under the orders of the Duma, saying they would carry out orders on condition that lives would be spared.Finally the Ministors then in power, in order to save their, lives, fled, the Revolution had no chief - certain off-icera agreed with their men, others were massacred by them, and the Revolution appeared to have entered into the hands of the rebel soldiers.In the meanvtfhlle, the workmen,- the Social Democrats and the Radical Socialists who wore, quickly joined by the &quot;Intellectuals&quot; - students, medical men, lawyers, etc. etc. -formed themselves into a union and elected a Committee which established itself at the Finland Railway station.From this moment a meeting was organised at the &apos;Harodny Dom,1 or &apos;Peoples Palace,1 which sat day and night without interruption and continued during several days.In the streets fire and massacre had been tho order of the da^.
It was under such conditions, when anarchy reignedsupreme, that certain members of the Duma united themselves underthe Presidency of Radzianko, to try and turn the overwhelming floodinto &quot;canals&quot;.These members formed themselves into a Committee whichconsidered as cooly as possible the whole situation and docided to make every effort to dominate the rumbling mass of rioters. It was of first importance to calm the public opinion, then it was necessary to select Chiefs to whom, some communication could be made.In the meantime the Government had nominated a new Commander cf Troops at Petrograd - a General Officer - -formerly Military Attache at Vienna.Guchkoff searched for him all day in vain.    He found him. in the evening, absolutely alone, and asked him if he could rely upon any single regiment, or even any single company - even on one man.The answer was &quot;Ho.&quot; The partisans of the Emperor no longer had any existence. No partisans of. the Old Regime existed any longer.The Members of the Committee are all Monarchists except one, - M. KHERENSKI - a Republican Socialist.&quot;It was decided that a deputation should be sent to the Emperor to lay the situation before him and obtain his abdication in favour of his son with Grand Duke Michael (Emperor1s brother) as RegentIt was thought that the sympathetic soul of the Russian people would be moved by the youth and.the delicate health of the young heir.    The Committee also counted on the mild indulgence of the nature of the Regent as a means of-establishing the basis of a new regime before the accession to the throne of the young Alexis..Guchkoff and another member of the Duma left for -Pskov.   On arrival at LOIJGA they saw the troops of the ?.n6 line established in trenches with their batteries of guns and machine
(4). ; &apos; &apos; .   399guns ready to meet the troops from the Front whom they .expected to he marching on Petrograd.On approaching Pskov they found the same measures Oaken by the 1st line troops in preparation to meet the advanoe of the troops which they believed to be marching against them to cover Potrograd,It was nevertheless oertain that the first line troops gave their support to the Revolutionary movement.During the three days the new movement had spread and those regiments which seemed the most loyal to the Emperor, especially those of the, 1st Cavalry Division of the Guards., turned over to those most opposed to him.   Composed as they are of officers of the highest ranks of Aristocracy they were all better acquainted than any others with tho scandals of the Court officials.   Thoy felt that tho war was being badly managed, that supplies ?/ere not assured,the question of transportation hopeless and badly run,etcrOn arrival at Pskov the delegates were at once received by tho Emperor.He had already prepared for his abdication, but refused to bo separated from his son whom ho wished, from his fathoms affec--tion for him, to take with him in his retirement and fall. In face of such tragedy tho delegation did not insist. It carried off the declaration which has already been mado public in the announcement of abdication.Meanwhile events had moved very -rapidly and during their return the deputation felt pretty curtain that tho abdication of the Emperor would not satisfy the .rebels.Tho next morning the members of the Provisional Committee, now turnod into a Provisional Government, called on tho Grand Duke kichaol and obtained his abdication, thus leaving tho people free ohoico of a Government regime..The Provisional Government thus finds itself in a position of &quot;wait and booo&quot;      It must await the decision of tho Constituent Assemblies, and whether tho lattur rally to a Monarchy or a Republic tho now members will bow to tho decision
5.400cf the people, they will in fact be either Monarchists or Republicans.The situation of tho Provisional Government is therefore a very critical one, and in much need of the support and help of the Allies to bring the war to a satisfactory conclusion.Guchkoff thought every Russian had been a partisan of war &quot;a 1&apos;outranee&quot; - to final victory, but there are influences at work to prevent this wish being realised.&apos;  Regular work must be resumed in the factories.All the material of these is intact, but the workmen have dismissed some of their Directors and Engineers,Production is thus reduced in quantity and quality -the former is not more than 5o%,In the Army one must proceed with great care and   &apos; slowly and tactfully to restore order and discipline.The first madness of triumph must pass away, and it will only be by slow degrees that one will be able to instil energetic measures.The Provisional Government is fully aware that its actual issue of instructions savour of weakness, but the fact of their knowledge of this is its own excuse, and it has the firm intention of recovering after a short period of delay - say a fortnight- - the mastery of the situation.German intrigue is at its full height at present and the Government is fighting this with all possible energy.But at the actual moment the greatest enemy of the Government is the Committee sitting in the Finland Railway Station.Prom the first days of its existence the Provisional Government looked upon its own life as merely ephemeral - it daily awaited its defeat.Daily, however, it is receiving proofs of sympathy from all parts of Russia and strengthening its position to the detriment of the Finland Station-Committee.Secessions and divided councils are showing them-selves in this latter body, In the first place the Military members
affiliated to the Workmen rs Union are no longer incomplete accord with the workmen, whose tendencies are opposed to theirs.        Again, among the workmen divisions are appearing, divisions of persons as well as of views.Thus from day to day indirectly the position of the Government is. becoming stronger.The situation is none the less critical, however, though it continues to improveBut where the situation is really graVe is, and I speak from a war point of view, in the Navy,In the Black Sea Fleet all goes well.This arises from the fact that the Admiral in command* a man of great energy,, quickly recognised the Provisional. Government and he and his officers announced to the men the new developments -the reversal of the old regime., its -conferences for the immediate present and the future), and when the echos      revolution arrived they arrived on fully prepared ground.. ,The situation in the Baltic is very different.There the men mutinied and killed many of their officers.       Very few are left, especially at KRONSTADT,   .-Bereft of officers they are nevertheless consoient-i-^usly looking after the will-being of their ships.All these are &apos; intact., great cleanliness, is maintained. -greater than before - it would almost appear as if the bluejackets wish to prove that a free man is more conscientious than a slave..This, however, does not do away with the gravely serious position that the right wing of the &apos;ordre de &quot;bataille&apos; is in the, air, and that the Gulf of Finland is open.to the enemy.It was as a matter of fact at KRONSTADT that tho    -rebellion was most violent,, and that the worst massacres took placo, comprising as it dies the &apos;bataillons de correction&quot; of tho Army.and the Fleet, and bandits, criminals and depraved and degenerate men had a free hand.The position nevertheless shows some slight signs-of recovery.
The garrison of K. comprises a few Territorial&apos; Regiments.    The latter, aware of the danger that exists have asked leave of the Provisional Government to recall to duty the recalcitrant sailors.The Government, fearing bloodshed, which might- extend, everywhere including the actual front, have contented themselves . for the moment with sending to KRONSTADT a Governor who will be acceptable to men in the&apos; ranks. -In a fortnight, M, Guchkoff added, he hoped to see ^rder restored, ,The presence of the Minister of War at our Headquarters he added, was to maintain General Alexeiff at the head ef the ArmyP.He believes that he is at--the present mwment, the only man who can assume this heavy task.All recognise his merits and his qualities as well as his talents0   A few, however, accuse him of want *f recognising the need for making changes which are necessary for management of men in the Army - of being too hard a disciplinarian in fact.This accusation, the Minister pointed out, may have a oertain amount of foundation in fact, but this would disappear he thinks, once the General were put in actual command,He asked us, however, to back him up by expressing-our opinion, if we agreed with him that Alexeieff was the one man to deal with the eituation.   This he begged us to do individually as opportunity occurred with the different members of the Government now assembled here.He told us he had come in advance of his colleagues who arrived later in the day, so as to consult with Alexeieff as to the higher commands of the Armies and Army Corps,.   This work they completed this morning, and they wre in entire accord as to the removal of all those who owed their position to Nepotism1.I then asked the Minister- as to the new 60 divisions, which are being formed.This introduction was made against the advice of Alexeieff and without warning to the Minister of War.
&quot; 4&quot;0&quot;3Those new divisions lack the necessary material. To each regiment is allotted but 8 machine guns, and the men are armed with rifles which properly should be in reserve in depots to make up losses in battle.The question for consideration is the abolition of these new divisions from the &quot;or&amp;ro de bataille.&quot;The Council of Ministers assembled to-day was to consider measures for protection of Petrograd from any landings of enony in Gulf of Finland.Such is the situation as represented to us Chiefs of Missions of Allies by the Minister.He concluded, as he had begun, with an appeal to our sympathy and assistance.The Ambassadors and Diplomats of Allies were he said in close touch with thy Government from day to day, but ho wished to represent to us as soldiers, the close way in which the internal situation affected military operations, and the considerations of our respective General Staffs in. V/ostern thoatro.He begged us to represent this to our respective Chiefs so that thoy might be fully aware of tho situation.I then thanked him On behalf of my colloaguos for his clear and frank statement, and assured him of our sympathy and support to him and his Government and to General Alexeiff.I folt the compliment he had frankly paid to our system of Government and wished him and his colleagues every success, which none of us will fail to endeavour to ensure.* referred to in (sd).
