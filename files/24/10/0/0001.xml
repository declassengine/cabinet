G.T... 401..WAR CAEII^T,GIBRALTAR-CEUCOMMITTEETRAIT SL AT I OH - OF - A REPORT OF A SPEECH-Delivered at Cadiz - on 25th  arch, 1917, by General Prima de RiveraHe contended. &quot;by speaking of the great difficulties which surrounded the theme with w ich he proposed to deal,  saying that from, every point of view it was necessary to understand the ground which he proposed to touch on, and that when driv-in.g a machine through such difficult country one&apos;a. hand must he continually on the. &quot;brake, and that the safety valve should &apos; be in working order,   He shared the, same patriotic opinion as Canovas, who had declared that the restoration of Gibraltar concerned England even more than Spain, for. there were not wanting some voices in that country which had raised thern-selves in protest against the violation of the territory of a friendly nation-    It was not possible to maintain infantile and patriotic illusions in the sunlight of history,  for a large part of the cxeed that was held by some was anathema to others.    It would be indeed a simple chimera to think that by means of a straggle Gibraltar could be restored, but there were friendly means.which might be used to such an end. It would appear that to our predecessors the English occupa-tion of Gibraltar did not concern them so much from the point of view of the strategic value of the fortress as from that of the honour of the flag, which was of deep significance to Spain.    He referred to the manner in which England had in former days possessed herself of Gibraltar,, and he hoped on the termination, of the fearful war. which was taking place to-day that an opportunity would present itself for the dis-cussion of the rights and integrity of the smaller nations and for a re--adju.otment.of therir national rights.    The English occupation cf Gibraltar was actually distasteful, in Spain though in no way could it be said that it was dangerous.    Certain well-known English public men shared this idea of devolution and declared in their speeches that this noble aspiration was also cherished by many distinguished-English journalists.    There were those in England indeed who held.the opinion that this fortress could be handed over in fair exchange for other places of importance in Africa which would be free for annexation when we withdrew from them.    It was possible to propose the ex-change &apos; of the fortress of Centa and its bay also to renounce the claims which were made at present to Tangier and to other portions of African territory...  He recalled to their reccllec-tion the memorable phrase of Isabela Catolica when she.said &quot;we ought to occupy territories in the Mediterranean without losing GibralLt-ar&apos;1 .    Africa is not Spain,  and if Africa was occupied by another nation which was not Spain,  it would not be necessary that the work of the Spanish merchant should be abandoned.    It would &quot;be necessary for Spain to superintend those highways and schools which- she had already constructed in Africa.RESTORATION
