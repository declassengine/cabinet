CABfr^a,.OPBRATIOn ,G, 0. G. in C, Egypt, 0, I. G. S *secret-.    28114th April, 1917,k*Hi 1815,High Commissioner has sent me the following which he received from Foreign Office (? and which) is a paraphrase of telegram 4 from Sir Mark Sykes at Turin&quot;I hear it is proposed to give- the command of French contingent attached to General Murrayfs forces to an officer of very high rank,       I suggest such an appointment may be, successfully resisted on the ground that it would be inconven--iont to place a very senior officer in command of such a small contingent,-    A further point for consideration is that given the presence of a French Military Officer of high grade other countries,wi11 press for similar ? nominations,&quot;I have sent the following reply to High Commissioner:-&quot;In reply to your letter of April 13th I understand from a wire I havo received from r7ar Office that General Bailloud, a very senior General, has already been appointed&quot; to command of.the French contingent in Palestine,   This will undoubtedly involve his being placed in a position quite out of keeping with his seniority and past record.   The French troops are definitely- detailed for work on the Lines of Communication and&apos;General Bailloud will certainly find himself part of the command of a Brigadier General who will command the Line.s of Communico.tion Defences,   Personally, so long as the position is fully understood by the French Ministry of V.&apos;ar, I have rib objection.    I am, hor/ever, sending the enclosed telegram to C.I.G.S., London.&quot; I leave the matter in your hands.
