Mei-norand-uni by the Admiralty-During the-past t^o months, thirty&apos; steam trawlers out of a total fleet -of less than four hundred, left to fishing,. have been destroyed by submarines; involving a loss of about l^t000 tons of fish per annum.&quot;and it is clear that&apos;.&apos; -unless effective measures- are,,-taken for; the safety,of the remainder, a very valuable source- of food supply will be seriously reduced.It is net practicable for the ordinary Patrols to afford protection tc steam trawlers,  as the latter,  in order - to fish efficiently, must necessarily operate at a considerable distance outside the-Patrol Lines, and it is considered that the only-, effective mode of protection is to arm the. vessels themselves.,-.The number, of&apos; guns available for thd purpose is insufficient to .arm all the vessels, and it will therefore be necessary,to comp^ife the unarmed vessels to operate -in. close company with those that, are -irmeda -Owing to the reckless courage c-f the trawler-men and their frequent disregard of regulations made for their own. safety&quot;,- it is not considered.possible to. carry out any such arrangement,, unless-the howling fleet are organised on a Naval basis, and made to- operate under &apos; strict Naval controlsA scheme of control is attaohedj and if it is approved it is proposed, that.&apos; as /a- general rulet the trawlers shall operate in f Ieets,-.under .the direct orders of. a Navs.1 Officer, who   ill be in-tireless&apos;; touch with the Mentor Naval Officer of\the&apos; dis^r-ietVIt is! hoped that, by the adoption of this scheme,-it will be possible to maintain,-&apos;&apos;and.&apos; perhaps,- to increase, supplied or fish food;, both by preventing the&apos; destruction of&apos; &quot;vessels, and -by allowing tho&apos; trawling&apos; fleets to operate on valuable fishing grounds; which are. now.necessarily closed by:. Admiralty&quot; Orders to uncontrolled vessels.It may. eventually, become necessary-to assume direct control of the drift-ret vessels and sailing trawlers alsor. and to-apply to them the principles of -the scheme proposed, for steam trawlers with such modifications of detail as may be necessary to meet the conditions of&quot; vessels.of these- classes..10th- April,.. 1917.
