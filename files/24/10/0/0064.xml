SECRET.iEPORT ON THE TREATMENT OF EXPORTS PROM THE UNITED KINGDOMITTEE ON COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL \ POLICY.-^md British Overseas Possessions and the Conservation op the Resources op the Empire during the Transitional Period after the &quot;War.To the Right Honourable D. Lloyd George, M.P., Prime Minister.We have the honour to present a second Interim Report, and in it we deal with the treatment of Exports from the United Kingdom and British Overseas Possessions, and the Conservation of the resources of the Empire during the Transitional period after the war.In our first Interim Report we have recommended that the present regime, whereby the importation of goods of enemy origin is prohibited, should be continued for a period of at least 12 months after the &quot;War, subject to license in exceptional cases. This regime will most probably, apart from any other measures, have as one result the restriction to a considerable extent of the export trade from this country to the present enemy countries; but it would not necessarily prevent them from obtaining such goods as they may seriously need. Given adequate evidence of origin the prohibition of imports from the enemy countries is a comparatively simple matter for a limited period, but it will at once be.apparent that the problem of controlling exports is much more difficult and complicated, not only because a simple prohibition of export to the present enemy countries will be insufficient to effect its object, but also because to secure the success of a restrictive policy it will be necessary to seek the co-operation of the Governments of the Dominions and Colonies, and in certain cases also of the Allied Powers.2. The problem presented to us involves the following considerations: (1) The extent to which the competition of enemy trade can be affected by restriction of exports from the United Kingdom.(2) The danger of shortage of important commodities produced in Great Britain or the Empire, or stored therein during the war, which might be required for provisioning the population and maintaining manufactures.(3) The supply of the Allies for the restoration of their industries as laid down in Resolution B. III. of the Transitory Measures of the Paris Conference.As regards (1) the Committee is unanimously desirous of doing everything practicable during the transitional period to prevent the enemy countries from obtaining an unfair advantage over the British Empire and over our Allies, whose industries have been seriously damaged. We feel, on the other hand, that to take steps of an ineffective and merely vexatious character would be neither dignified nor useful. It is obvious that effective control can only be exercised over products in which. Great Britain and the British Empire have a virtual monopoly. Any attempt to restrict the exportation of products in which this is not the case would merely tend to develop the supplies from other sources, and might have far reaching effects detrimental to British trade after the conclusion of the transitional period.As regards (2) the first and most obvious course would be to continue the present regime so far as enemy countries are concerned, that is a general prohibition of exports from the United Kingdom to enemy countries, exceptions being permitted only under licence. This policy, although superficially attractive, presents the difficulty that, if exports to neutral countries are permitted without restriction, enemy traders will be able to provide themselves through such sources at little, if any, additional expense. Unless it be proposed to continue a system of rationing neutral countries such a policy would merely have the effect of appearing to do something, while in reality achieving no useful result.&apos;V   (33)2872(2528)   G 15    100  4/17- E&amp;s- ------- ASir,Part I.
3. The Resolutions adopted at the Economic Conference held at Paris hearing upon the matter are Numbers B I. and III. of the Transitory Measures.B. I.&quot; The Allies declare their common determination to ensure the re-estab-lishment of the countries suffering from acts of destruction and spoliation and unjust requisition, and decide to join in devising means to secure the restoration to those countries, as a prior claim, of their raw materials, industrial and agricultural plant, stock and mercantile fleet, or to assist them to re-equip themselves in these respects.&quot;* B. III.&quot;The Allies declare themselves agreed to conserve for the Allied countries, before all others, their natural resources during the whole period of commercial, industrial, agricultural and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose they undertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate the interchange of these resources.&quot;4. It appears to us that effect cannot be given to these Resolutions unless export restrictions are placed during the transitory period upon a certain number of important articles.We consider that any measures undertaken for the purpose should aim at assuring to the British Empire and the Allies priority for their requirements and at preventing the present enemy countries from gaining by the use of such materials an initial advantage in the competition to recover markets which will follow the war.5. It will be found that the British Empire and the Allies are in a position, if practicable measures can be jointly devised, to attain these objects in respect of many important commodities. The situation in this connection is illustrated by the figures given in Table I. appended to this Report showing materials for which Germany is mainly dependent on the British Empire and Allied Countries. The subsequent Tables show the percentages of the total German imports of these materials in 1912 which were obtained:- Ia. Erom the United Kingdom.Ib. Erom the British Empire.Ic. Erom the British Empire and Allied Countries.Id. Erom Allied countries (excluding the British Empire).Similar tables are also added with reference to Austro-Hungarian imports.If the position of the United Kingdom be considered separately, it will be found that of the exports from the United Kingdom to Germany before the war roughly four-fifths were comprised under the headings of Textiles, Coal, Metals, Iron and Steel Manufactures (including Machinery), and Eish, and that of this amount a considerable proportion was imported, by Germany for use as raAv materials, or for further manufacture. In the case of the raw materials and partly manufactured articles set out in Table Ia an appreciable percentage of the total imports into Germany consisted of products of the United Kingdom.6. But the figures contained in the Tables referred to will show that the question cannot usefully be considered in relation to exports from the United Kingdom only, and it will be necessary to consider whether any arrangements for the purposes indicated in paragraph 4 can also be applied to materials, an important proportion of which was imported by Germany before the War from parts of the British Empire other than the United Kingdom and from Allied countries. It is obvious that action taken by the United Kingdom alone would be of minor importance, and that any effective arrangements on a larger scale will require the consent and co-operation of the Governments of India, the Dominions and Colonies, and of those of our Allies who will be concerned.7. We understand that Resolution B. III. was agreed to by the representatives of the Government at the Paris Conference, subject to our Commercial Treaty obligations towards neutrals, and on the understanding that each material would be considered separately. In view of the varying circumstances we are of opinion that it will be necessary to consider separately, as regards each material with which it is thought desirable to deal, what methods can be most appropriately applied for the purposes in view, either by the British Government acting so far as the United
Kingdom is concerned, or by arrangement between the British Government and the Governments of the Dominions and Allies.8. After considering the subject in all its bearings we have come to the con-clusion that a policy of controlling exports during the transitory period immediately following the war can and should be applied to carefully selected materials, the imports of which into the enemy countries before the war were mainly derived from the British Empire and Allied Countries, and the available supply of which will be wholly or mainly required by the British Empire and the Allies immediately after the war.9. We do not consider that it would be either practicable or expedient to attempt to prevent the enemy countries from obtaining materials, as regards which the British Empire and the Allies will not be in a position to absorb the greater part of their production. To do so would involve the continuance after the war on an elaborate scale of the system of rationing neutral countries, and of exacting stringent guarantees of the ultimate destination of exports which has been partially applied during the war. Under the exceptional conditions prevailing in war it is possible by means of the sea-power of Great Britain, and the consequent restriction of shipping to induce some of the neutral states to accept such a limitation of their trading rights; but we are of opinion that an attempt to continue such a general arrangement after the war would raise questions of great international difficulty, and we have the gravest doubt whether it could, under any circumstances, be made practically effective when the ordinary channels of commerce among the other nations of the world are freely open.It is also very desirable that interference with the export trade of this country after the war should be limited to cases in which it is clearly required by the public interest.10. These difficulties will be avoided if control is limited to materials which fall; within the description given in paragraph 8.Their export to the present enemy countries should not be permitted, save under exceptional circumstances, but in view of the fact that the available surplus, if any, will ex hypothesi be limited, it will be unnecessary in cases in which export to neutral countries is permitted to attempt any control of the ultimate destination.11. We proceed to indicate the manner in which the policy already outlined should, in our opinion, be applied to exports from the United Kingdom. We recommend that the Government should seek powers from Parliament to prohibit during the period of reconstruction immediately following the war the export to all or any destinations, except under license, of such articles as may be deemed expedient, and that for a period of at least 12 months the export of the products mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs should be prohibited to all destinations except under license. A similar prohibition of export should also be applied, if necessary, to any other important commodities in the case of which it may be found that there is a danger of shortage. The control thus obtained should be exercised so as to secure that the requirements of the British Empire and Allied countries are first satisfied, and the export of the surplus to neutral countries should be permitted. As regards the general question of the reservation of supplies for ourselves and our Allies during the period of reconstruction, we have had under consideration certain proposals as to the form of the machinery requisite for that purpose, and suggestions on the subject are submitted in Part II. of this Report.12. The Textiles Committee have recommended the prohibition of export of textiles and the raw or partly manufactured materials for textiles from the British Empire to the enemy countries immediately after the war. We shall refer to the. question of Indian and Egyptian cotton, jute, and raw wool in dealing with the position of the British Empire as a whole in this connection. So far as the United Kingdom alone is concerned, we think that a policy of restriction and regulation should be applied to Cotton Yarn, and to Wool Tops, and Worsted, Mohair, and Alpaca Yarns. The export of Cotton Yarn to Germany consisted mainly of finer counts which were used in the manufacture of hosiery, lace, embroidery, gloves, and sewing cotton. Several of these branches of manufacture are, we are told, capable of considerable extension in this country, and such extensions are actually being carried out, and it is believed that during the period immediately following the war the output of such yarns can be absorbed in the United Kingdom and Allied Countries, regard being had in particular to the requirements of Erance until such time as the fine-spinning machinery of Northern France can be re-established.
Similarly, the output of Wool Tops and Worsted Mohair and Alpaca Yarns, which formerly found a market in Germany, is likely to find compensatory outlets, pending the restoration of the French&apos; and Belgian industries.&apos; 13. The Coal Trades Committee have stated that they are not prepared at the present stage to recommend the prohibition of the export of Coal to enemy countries after the war! The Committee point out that the exports from the United Kingdom to &quot;those countries in 1913 exceeded 10 million tons, largely from the East of Scotland, the Tyne and Humber ports, and that the quantity was a very considerable pro-portion of the total exports from those areas. It is suggested that to find com-pensatory outlets for so large a quantity may prove no easy matter, and the witnesses examined by the Coal Trades Committee were disinclined to favour the prohibition of exports to enemy countries unless such outlets could be assured.That Committee also express the opinion that the export restrictions placed upon the Coal Trade during the war should cease at the earliest possible moment.&apos;14. The Coal Trades Committee, however, appear to think that it may take some 12 months from the end of the war before the output of 1913 can be generally reached, and we are of opinion that during that period it may be necessary to regulate the export of coal in order to ensure that the requirements of the United Kingdom and the Allies are met. We consider that compensatory outlets should be sought in Erance, Italy and Belgium for a large portion of the coal formerly exported to Germany.15. In view of the urgent necessity which will exist at the end of the war for the replacement of depreciated machinery in this country, and of the obligations imposed upon us by the concluding words of Resolution B. I. of the Transitory Measures adopted at the Paris Conference, it will almost certainly be necessary to control the export of certain classes of machinery in order that priority may be given during the period of reconstruction to the requirements of the United Kingdom and the Allies.16. Having regard to the nature of the fishing industry we do not think that the control of exports of fish would be practicable under peace conditions. We do not, therefore, recommend that any attempt should be made to prevent the export of fish to present enemy destinations.17. We desire to add that our recommendation that the export of the materials mentioned above should be controlled during the-transitory period is subject to the condition that the grant of export licences is administered by strong Committees on which the trades concerned should be fully represented, and that every effort is made to make the administration as simple and expeditious as possible.18. We turn to the consideration of the materials mentioned in Table Ib which are wholly or mainly produced within the British Empire. As regards these materials, we are not in a position to submit any precise proposals as to the method of control to be adopted, but we recommend that the Government should enter into consultation without delay with the Governments of the Dominions and Colonies concerned, with a view to the application of the principles indicated in paragraph 4 to such materials as it may be found possible to select for treatment on these lines.19. The most important of these is Wool. We are informed that the supply of all kinds of Wool is likely to be insufficient for the requirements of the world after the war. This is particularly the case as regards Merino Wool, for the supply of which Germany and Austria are practically dependent upon Australia and South Africa. We consider it of the greatest importance that, if possible, joint measures should be devised with the Dominions to secure the control of their output of all kinds of Wool immediately after the war.20. It is desirable also that the Government of India should be urged to undertake the control of the supplies of Jute and Cotton, and the Government of Egypt the control of the supply of Cotton, which we think are likely to be barely sufficient to meet the requirements of the world, exclusive of the present enemy countries.21. In, the case of Oil Seeds and Nuts, we understand that proposals have already been&quot; adopted by the Government for diverting from the enemy countries after the war the production of certain African Colonies.   We recommend that the
Government of India should be asked to consider whether any practical measures can be devised with a similar,object as regards the supplies under its control.22. We take the opportunity of observing at this point that we do not overlook the fact that objection may be taken to the restrictive policy which we recommend, on the ground that the burden may fall unduly upon the individual producer whose price may be lowered by the restriction of his market. In our opinion, it is particularly important to avoid even the appearance of any such penalisation, especially in cases in which the interests of native subjects of the Empire are concerned. We think, however, that, if the policy is limited, as we have recom-mended, to materials of which the greater part of the supply can be absorbed by the United Kingdom and the Allies, it will be possible in consultation with the various Governments concerned to devise satisfactory safeguards to meet this danger.23. As regards mineral supplies certain steps have, we understand, already been taken in co-operation with the Australian Government, and other proposals have been referred for the consideration of the Non-Eerrou$ Metals Committee. We concur generally in the recommendation of the Iron and Steel Trades Committee that, so far as may be arranged, no raw materials shall be permitted immediately after the war to be despatched to the present enemy countries from mineral resources under British control. We shall have occasion to make further suggestions in this connection in a subsequent report, which we propose to submit on the question of essential industries, which forms part of our terms of reference. We therefore defer for the present consideration of this very important group of raw materials.24. We have indicated in the preceding paragraphs the most important materials to which Ave consider that an attempt should be made to apply the principles laid down in this report. It is not possible for us to recommend what precise methods should be applied in each case. These can only be devised after consultation with the Governments of the Dominions, and we recommend that the Government should enter into immediate negotiations to attain this object. In the event of the Dominions finding it impossible to adopt the suggestions we have made, we think that it might be represented to them that a measure of success for the policy we advocate might be secured by the adoption by them of a heavy export duty to present enemy countries, due precautions being taken to prevent purchases by neutrals on account of present enemy countries.25. We further recommend that the Government should also at the earliest possible moment approach the Governments of the Allies, with a view to ascertaining what steps they are prepared to take as regards important materials, over which they are in a position to exercise effective control. In particular, our attention has been drawn to the fact that there may be difficulty after the war in securing sufficient supplies of Hides and Tanning Materials, and it may be found desirable to continue and develop, for such period as may be agreed upon, the arrangements entered into during the war with France and Italy for the mutual exchange of certain classes of these materials, and to ascertain whether analogous arrangements could be made with the Russian Government.Similarly, any schemes for dealing with the supplies of Max and Hemp will depend upon the assistance which Russia and Italy are able to render. It may also he found possible to make arrangements with the Russian Government for securing supplies of Timber.26. As a preliminary condition of the negotiations which we recommend in the last two paragraphs, it is essential that small expert Committees should be appointed to consider, as regards each material with which it is proposed to deal, what are likely to be the requirements of the United Kingdom immediately after the war, and what methods might be adopted in each case. In view of the important materials of which the whole or the greater part of the world&apos;s supply is derived from the British Empire, the Government should be in an advantageous position, if the co-operation of India and the self-governing Dominions can be secured, for negotiating with the Allied Governments, with a view to mutual arrangements as regards commodities which they for their part are able to control.We desire to emphasise our opinion that without the full consent and co-operation of all the Governments concerned, it will not be possible to carry the Paris Resolutions successfully into effect.
.   Part II.27. As abeady indicated in paragraph 11, it has&apos;been represented to ns that the working of a; policy of common action among the Allies, which we have recom-mended in Part I. of this Report, might be&apos; greatly assisted by the establishment of a common&apos; Allied organisation for certain purposes, and that such an organisation might be on the lines of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, which has been set up in: London since the outbreak of the war to co-ordinate the purchases of the Allied Governments for war purposes. &quot;We have had the advantage of hearing evidence on this subject from Sir Edmund Wyldbore Smith, Chairman of the Commission, from Mr. TJ. E. Wintour, C.M.G., Director of Army Contracts, and Mr, E. E. Wise, Assistant Director (the last two of whom have also given us valuable assistance upon the subjects dealt wdth in Part I. of this Report), and, while we are not in a position to submit any detailed scheme, we think that, if the policy recom-mended in Part I. of this Report is accepted by the various Governments concerned, the&apos; foregoing suggestion merits careful study.28. We suggest that, so far as-may be arranged, the Commission, or some similar body, might deal with such orders to be placed by the Allied Governments for reconstruction purposes as may be found convenient, and also with such private orders for important materials in connection therewith as the Governments concerned may find it possible and expedient to centralise. Although Government orders will not,, of course, form so large a proportion of the total demands upon industry after the war as they do at present, yet they will no doubt continue for some time to be on a large scale. Moreover, we are informed that in certain cases, in which, owing to the insufficiency of the total production, careful allocation of available supplies has been necessary, some of the Allied Governments have found it desirable during the war to concentrate &quot;purchasing power in one body representing both the State and the private consumers. Thus the whole of the steel and pig iron which is now imported into Erance is purchased by the Erench Comite des Eorges at prices agreed between them and the British Ministry of Munitions. Similarly, applications from private firms&quot; in Erance and Italy for certain classes of wool are forwarded by one central body, namely, the Ministry of Commerce, in each of those countries. We think that in the case of certain commodities the circumstances prevailing after the war may make it expedient to continue arrangements of this kind.29. In dealing with orders of the nature referred to in the last paragraph, it should be the object of the Commission to prevent unnecessary competition between the Governments concerned, both in this country and in other countries, and to secure that due consideration is given to the needs of the devastated areas of those countries and that, so far as possible, the Allied requirements are met in an economical manner within the Allied countries. With the help of the valuable information and experience which have been obtained during the war, both by the Commission itself and by the Contract Branches of the Government Departments, it should, we think, be feasible, while the peace negotiations are in progress, for the Commission to form an.estimate upon the basis of data furnished by the Governments concerned of reconstruction requirements and of the capacity of each country to supply them, account being taken of whatever supplies it may be possible to obtain by way of indemnity from the enemy countries. We understand that the Erench Government has, in fact, already appointed a Commission to study the future needs of Northern Erance and that the Belgian Government is also giving consideration to the subject.30. We think that the Commission would be enabled to secure sufficient priority for its reasonable requirements in the United Kingdom by means of the control of exports which we have recommended in paragraphs 11 to 15 of this Report, and that it might assist in&apos; the workingof that control and in obtaining compensatory outlets for&apos;&apos; commodities which formerly found a market in the enemy countries. In the eiercise of any such right of priority regard must be had to the imperative necessity of encouraging the general export trade of the country, and therefore such priority must be exercised in respect only of some fixed proportion of the actual output of the materials controlled. In this connection the Commission should of course co-operate with the Committees representative of trade interests, the establishment of which we have recommended in paragraph 17.- - 31. As we have already indicated there are certain important raw materials, the supply of which immediately after the war is likely to be insufficient to meet the
requirements of the world, and it has been represented to ns that the needs of this country and of the Allies might most effectively be met by the joint purchase on behalf of the respective Governments of such supplies as are available. Such a policy has, we are informed, been adopted by the British Government during the war in the case of certain commodities, notably &quot;Wool. The situation is, however, radically altered when the question becomes one of supplying with raw materials manufacturers who are working, not, as at present, almost entirely on Government orders, but on a competitive basis for home and foreign markets, and we see serious objections to the interposition of the Government in such circumstances. We are strongly of opinion, therefore, that after the war this course should only be adopted in the last resort, but if other measures are decided after fnil inquiry to be inadequate or impracticable, it may be found that the immediate requirements of the Allied countries as regards a limited number of staple articles of vital importance, the supply of which there is good reason to suppose may be seriously insufficient, can only be safeguarded by a combination of Government purchase and distribution of the available supplies with a system of controlling export. Measures of this kind, which should be strictly limited to the period immediately following the end of the war, may in some instances provide the best means of meeting the difficulties to which reference is made in paragraph 22 of this Report. If they are to be successfully applied, it is essential that the necessary arrangements should be agreed upon by the various Governments concerned before the conclusion of the war, and we therefore emphasise in this connection also the necessity of immediate action on the lines recommended in paragraphs 24 to 26 above. It is also important that the financial arrangements involved in any operations of the kind discussed in this Part of this Report should be carefully settled beforehand between the different Governments.32. We desire, in conclusion, to make it clear that in our opinion the operations of the suggested Commission, while they may prove economical as regards Govern-ment purchases, should be strictly confined to the cases to which we have referred. The intrusion of any such body between buyers and sellers, however necessary this may be in cases of urgent national importance, inevitably results in serious and ex-pensive delays and often in loss of trade, and, we are convinced that, if the commercial position of this country is to be rapidly1 restored after the war, it is essential that there should be as little interference as possible with the normal agencies of private trading. We have only to add that, as in the case of the recommendations made in Part I. of this Report, the success of the additional measures suggested in the pre-ceding paragraphs will be dependent upon their meeting with the active approval of the Governments of the Dominions and of our Allies. -SUMMARY.33. Our conclusions as regards the branch of our enquiry dealt with in this Report may be briefly summarised as follows : (1) Any general prohibition of exports to present enemy countries after the war and any continuance of the system of rationing neutral countries are impracticable and inexpedient, but the Paris Resolutions can be carried into effect if a policy of joint control of certain important commodities can be agreed upon between the British Empire and the Allies for the Transitional Period. Any measures should aim at securing to the British Empire and the Allied countries priority for their requirements and should be applied only to materials which are mainly derived from those countries and will be required by them (paragraphs 1 to 10).(2) This policy should be applied as regards the United Kingdom by legislation empowering the Government&apos;to prohibit the export except under licence of such articles as may be deemed expedient. Under these powers the export of certain commodities which we specify should be controlled, as well as that of any other important commodities, in the case of which it may be found that there is a danger of shortage. The regime should be administered Avith the help of strong committees on which the trades concerned should be fully represented (paragraphs 11 to 17). -        &apos;(3) As regards the British Empire and the Allied countries the&apos; Govern-ment should without delay enter into negotiations with the various Goverh-ments concerned, with a view to the adoption of suitable joint measures as regards selected commodities of importance. Eor this purpose expert com-mittees should at once be appointed (paragraphs 18 to 26).
s(4) The Government should consider, in consultation with the Allies, the expediency of establishing after the war a joint organisation on the lines of the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement for dealing with the orders of the Allied Governments for reconstruction purposes, and with&apos; such private orders as they may find it expedient to centralise. In exceptional cases it may be found necessary to adopt a policy of Government purchase of certain important raw materials, the supply of wdiich cannot otherwise be safeguarded (paragraphs 27 to 32).We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,BALFOUR OF BURLEIGH (Chairman).ARTHUR BALEOUR.HENRY BIRCHENOUGH.ALFRED BOOTH.*FARINGDON.h.
