April 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.Ministry of Shipping.SHORTAGE OF TONNAGE IN RELATION TO THE WHITE SEAPROGRAMME.1. IT is necessary to bring before the Cabinet the serious shortage in the tonnage available to meet Government requirements plus the Russian White Sea programme during the summer of 1917.2. The Russian White Sea programme requires 138 vessels by the end of May, and a further 115 by the end of August, making a total of 253 vessels.3. The Imports Restriction programme (reducing imports by 500,000 tons a month as compared with 1916) was based upon an estimate by Sir Norman Hill as to the reduction required to leave sufficient vessels for Government requirements, including the White Sea. The figure was, however, inadequate for this purpose, and was rendered still less adequate by the fact that the Restriction programme did not become operative till March, and cannot become fully operative till July. Sir Alfred Watson and Mr. Elderton estimated that the rate of reduction would have had to be 1,000,000 tons per month to meet the shortage, and since then the situation has become still Worse through the loss of neutral tonnage (beyond what was contemplated) in consequence of the intensive submarine campaign.The necessary tonnage for the White Sea programme cannot now be found by further direct prohibition of imports, if only on the score of time. Such further action as can be taken must be mainly by direct allocation of ships to certain work and withdrawal from other work.4. The statement in paragraph 7 shows the extent to which vessels now under requisition or under notice of requisition are inadequate to meet Government require-ments during this summer.Paragraphs 9-11 show the various sources from which further vessels might be obtained.5. The British vessels 1,600 gross tonnage and over now on continuous Government (including Allied) services (armed merchant cruisers, hospital ships, colliers for home fleet, troop transports, cross-channel ships, &amp;c), number 607 (see paragraph 7).It is assumed that these vessels will remain at the same numbers, additional vessels requiring to be found to replace those lost or damaged by war and marine risk.6. The net losses (after allowing for new building and purchases) are estimated at about 231 vessels between the I5th April and 31st August. About 150 of these may be taken to be of vessels under requisition.7. Besides the Government services,, on which vessels are normally employed continuously, there are a large number (such as wheat, sugar, coal, for Mediterranean) for which vessels are found voyages by voyage, the vessels as they finish each voyage being allotted either to the same or to different work as is most convenient at the moment.The following table shows the vessels which require to be found for such services plus those required for the White Sea and to replace losses. The &quot;vessels available &quot; include vessels now doing private work, but under notice- to come on Government service for one voyage and therefore available for re-allocation at the end of that voyage. \ -In the three periods of six weeks, 15th April-31st May, 1st June-1.5tb July, 16th July-3ist August, the following vessels have to be found for Government (including White Sea) requirements.[494] B

This deficit of 310&quot; must be made good by (a) requisitioning or otherwise obtaining further vessels for Government service; or (b) reducing present British Government or Allied services; or (c) by reducing the White Sea programme; or rather by some combination of these three. It is proposed to examine these three separately.9. Possibilities of obtaining Further Vessels for Government Service. It must first be observed that so many ships have already been taken for Government service as to leave an inadequate number of vessels to import the articles still allowed to come in as essential under the Restriction of Imports programme ; and that in framing the programme in paragraph 7 above about one-third of the net losses by war risk, &amp;c. (or eighty-one vessels), are left to fall on private imports.Any additional requisitioning must still further reduce private imports.The following is a full statement of all British vessels (except tankers) of 1,600 tons gross and upwards as at the 31st March, 1917 : &quot;Vessels under requisition or notice of requisition (including those requi-sitioned for wheat and sugar for Allies) Chartered vessels allotted to Allies   ... Colonial registered vessels trading in colonies, &amp;c. Repairing, &amp;c.Tramps not in full Government service Liners ..1,645* 252 188 85 1381,0173,325* Credit has been taken for all these vessels in paragraphs 5 and 7. Moreover, as seventeen vessels under notice of requisition are at present on Allied service, the steps already taken involve depriving the Allies of this number of vessels.It is necessary to examine in more detail the employment of the tramps and liners referred to above.Tramps. The vessels were employed as follows :  (1.) Trading to colonies ...(2.) Committed to load cargoes for United Kingdom of (a.) Maize, rice, grain, &amp;c. *(J.) Ore, phosphates, lead, &amp;c.(c.) Sugar, rum, nitrates, spirits(d.) Coals coasting United Kingdom,(e.) Oils, kernels, timber, &amp;c.(/.) &quot;Whaling supplies and produce...       ....( .) Paper and pulp(/i.) General cargo, cotton, munitions (3.) Loading outwards home commitments unknown (4.) Cable repair ships   ... (5.) Trading permanently abroad ...Total* Of these, however, 17 were bringing return cargoes of ore, &amp;c after having loaded coal out for our Allies.1614 27&apos;6 18 1561644 21138., to this countryTo take any of these would involve losing, vessels for our ore, &amp;c, imports, and also depriving the Allies of tonnage.While a large number of these vessels are being requisitioned at Blue Book rates, practically none can be diverted without replacement from their present work, so that no help towards meeting the deficit can be looked for from this source.
Ldners.-Liners were distributed as follows on 31st March : Employed in distant waters        ...         ... ... 299Trading North Atlantic / United Kingdom ... ... ... 255,,     South America /*(Jnited Kingdom ... ... ... 69,,     India/United Kingdom ...        ... ... ... 103,,     Far Bast/ United Kingdom         ... ... ... 58    ,,,     Australasia / United Kingdom      ... ... .?. 63,,     Mediterranean/ United Kingdom  ... ... ... 67.                    other lines / United Kingdom      ... ... ... 1031,017It must be remembered that (a.) The requisitioning of practically all tramps for fall Government service has left the requirements of the country, for which the Government has not assumed full responsibility (e.g., imports of raw material for cotton and other manufactures) to be met by liners.(b.) The North Atlantic liners carry 80-85 rper cent, of wheat and munitions at Blue Book rates, while devoting the remainder of their space to other essential articles, mainly foodstuffs. A large part of the remaining liners are also bringing Government stores. Insulated space in liners from the Plate and Australasia is, for instance, requisitioned for meat.(c.) All liner trades are being requisitioned and the vessels brought under Blue Book conditions, and directed solely with a view to securing from them the work which is most essential from the point of view of this country and the Empire.(d.) Those shown as trading abroad represent those which have been left, after more than a year&apos;s continuous pressure and special appeals, on work which various parts of the Empire regard as essential. A number of the vessels are not suitable for general ocean-going work.No great help must therefore be expected from this source.It is proposed to try to requisition 25 vessels for full Government service from abroad, and to obtain the equivalent of 50 further vessels by diversion of other liners from more distant employment to the North Atlantic; total, 75. This represents the utmost that we can hope for this summer, and it will involve great hardship both to the Colonies and to our export trade of cotton goods, &amp;c.Other Sources. As far as other sources are concerned, purchases of neutrals, &amp;c, are allowed for in estimating the net losses.Time-chartered neutrals are allotted to France and Italy, and are allowed for in the estimate in paragraph 10 (vi) of what we should ask for from France.The only other possible windfall is the forty-seven British vessels of 1,600 tons locked in the Baltic.   If these can be obtained they will greatly help the position.10. Vessels now on Government and Allied Services : Ships.(i.) Nitrates. We have been asked to increase our monthly imports from 20,000 tons to 30,000 tons.   If this increase can be postponed till the winter we save twenty ships       ... ... ... ...   20(ii.) Munitions from America. We at present lift some 250,000 tons a month. It is believed that a great proportion of the munitions are not actually required for this year&apos;s campaign. If we could reduce the quantity to 100,000 tons a month till the autumn we should get the equivalent of fifty ships ... ... ... ... ...   50(iii.) Wheat from Archangel. There is some hope of getting 250,000 tons of wheat from Archangel. As this is not allowed for in the wheat estimates, the import of this quantity in vessels returning from Russia would mean a saving of forty ships      ... ... ...   40(iv.) Saving on Timber and Sugar Vessels. The Russian programme allows for the import of 600,000 tons of timber in vessels returning from Russia.Twenty-five vessels are engaged in importing timber from the Gulf, Canada, &amp;c. In view of the Russian imports, the proba-bilitythat shortage of timber is noVso disastrous to military opera-tions as shortage of other stores, and the increased production of timber in this country and Frarce, a considerable proportion of these vessels might, perhaps, be taken off (say 15-20 vessels). [494]&apos; - J B 2
Ships.We are now providing vessels to import sugar at the rate of 100,000 tons a month, which takes some 60 steamers. Some reduc-tion in these is, perhaps, possible (say 5T10 vessels)       ...       ^ ....   25(v.) Miscellaneous Vessels from Naval and Military Services.-Reductions of a few vessels here and there (e.g., on Mediterranean colliers, hay and oats vessels) might give, say, 25 vessels    ... ... ...   25(vi.) Contribution from France- France has at present 320 British vessels of 1,600 tons gross and upwards.Of these, sixteen have already been notified that they must come upon British service.In view of the consideration that (a.) The British have taken over, a larger proportion of the line which adds to British military requirements while reducing French.(6.) The Inter-Allied Chartering Bureau has already chartered some I million tons, nearly half of which is given to Italy and half to France, none being taken by Russia, and only about ^ by Great Britain, and is likely to get a good deal more. We might still forgo our share if we get British vessels back instead.(c.) America should be able to give substantial help at an early date, and we might support a request from France that this should go to France.In consideration of these concessions, we are asking for 100 vessels back in addition to those already notified and allowed for, and we might conceivably, get back vessels equivalent to, say, 75 for the White Sea, though this will be a task of the utmost difficulty ...   75Total ...    .     ... ... ... ... ... 235With additional vessels obtained, as shown in paragraph 9       ... ...   75^ The deficit ... ... ... ... ... 310In considering the possibility of postponing the shipment of nitrates and of munitions from America, as proposed in. paragraph 10 (ii) above, it should be borne in mind that by the autumn to winter the shipping situation should be relieved by the following factors, which, on the whole, should compensate for excess of losses over building and purchase :  ,(a.) The German 61 (and possibly Austrian 15) vessels in North America shouldmany of them then be at work. (b.) The German (118) and Austrian (10) vessels in South American ports mayalso many of them be in employment, (c.) Some 75 vessels  now bringing wheat from  Australia should be home,and it should not (if the&apos;&apos; harvests in America and Canada are good) benecessary to send them there again.   Sending them on the North Atlanticwould mean a saving of 50 vessels. (d.) The 250 vessels will be coming back from the White Sea. (e.)-The East African campaign, which absorbs 25 vessels, should be concluded.Note. The above estimate is based upon our obligation to give Italy coal remaining at 150,000 tons a month. -We are at present, as an emergency measure, giving a further quantity of about 50,000 tons.No allowance is made for increased demands by any service except those definitely notified.No margin is allowed for some parts of the programme (as they inevitably will) falling short; such a margin would be provided if the Baltic vessels could be obtained. , &apos;In particular no margin has been allowed for any future increased rate of loss by submarine, which may come with the longer days of summer.12. Reduction in Russian Programme.- The above programme, even if approved as it stands, would in practice fail to be fully operative, and, in the absence of an
absolute assurance as to getting the Baltic vessels, which we can scarcely hope to obtain at once, it is suggested that a margin of at least fifty vessels must be found by reduction of the Russian programme.It cannot, however, be too strongly emphasised that the uncertainty as to losses, damages, delays through diversions, &amp;c, make a close estimate impossible.In conclusion, it is desired to impress upon the Cabinet that the above programme can only be carried through with : (a.) The requisite labour to work loading and discharging at the quickest possible rate, with night work by means of double shifts wherever practicable. This means a large increase of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion, probably to not less than 15,000 men, as the railways also have to be dealt with. It is clear that there is no work upon which the return per man has so high a value in increased supplies.(&amp;.) A special effort to increase the skilled labour available for ship repairing. Thepresent submarine campaign has meant an immense increase in the numberof cases of serious damage, (c.) Labour also forthcoming in sufficient quantities for the home production ofimported  articles where  the  return per- man is greatest i.e., timberand ore.(d.) Facilities also given for maintaining and increasing the rate of mercantile shipbuilding.Summary of Foregoing Proposals.Deficit 310.(1.)

Allow as margin by reduction of Russian programme say 50 ships        ...    50General Note.It is of great importance that a general plan of allocation of tonnage should be laid down now, and not modified at short notice. If, for instance; we had to increase largely the tonnage available for wheat at short notice, it could only be done by stopping shipments of munitions from America. If, however, this were done at the last moment, the munitions would be on the way to the ports, the railways would be congested, the ships would be delayed, and less wheat would get through.It is realised, of course, that it will not be possible to avoid the necessity of making some alterations with little notice, but it is of great importance that they should be reduced to the smallest possible number.It will be seen that immediate instructions, are necessary as to the extent to which the programme for supplying Russia with coal and munitions must be carried out, having regard to the effect upon Government services as indicated above.April 16, 1917.
