G.T.495WAR CABINET &apos;  41FORT DEVELOPMENT IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND REPORT CF LORD ST. DAVIDS4 COMMITTEE(War Cabinet With reference to the decision of theICC, Min.8)   -   War Cabinet on 21st March,.-.-1917&quot;, that a Committeeshould be appointed to inquire into the question of the further development of the western ports of Ireland and Scotland for the importation of wheat, we beg to report as follows :-IRELAND1.     The Committee after making preliminary investigations in London proceeded to Dublin, vrtiere they made exhaustive en-quiries and ascertained -(a) that in the cpinion of the Director of National Service in Ireland, there-would be no difficulty in obtaining labour and this vievir was borne out by the statements obtained at the various ports visited.(b) that the question of the rail transport of such grain as could be discharged in Ireland presented .no difficulty.  ,2.     The Committee found after visiting all the Irish ports that appeared to be capable of utilization,- that by making the best possible use (See Appendix A.) ofQueenstown CorkFenit, and Limerick,and developing them as far as i&amp; practicable within the next six months, enough wheat can be landed and transported, during the course of a year, to supply the annual wants (approximately 800,000 tons) of Ireland, with a margin over. .- The following table shows the cereal capacity of the portsQueenstown) 500,000 tons per annum,Cork )Fenit 130,0C0     &quot;     &quot;      &quot;Limerick        - 500,000     &quot;     &quot;       &quot;Total &apos;      30,000 -If temporary extensionat Fenit is carried out -     130,000 tons additionalcan be receivedi.e. a Total of 1,060,000 tons per annum.3.     The Committee found that Ireland only mills approxi-mately half the amount of wheat consumed, and imports, principally from the United Kingdom, the remaining half,, in the form of flour. The Irish Mills are not working their full capacity, and some r\i the mills are even closed down.-.  The Committee, therefore,
SCOTLANDSo    As a result, of their visit to the west coast of Scotland; the Committee are of opinion that only three ports could usefully be employed at present, namely, Glasgow, Greenoak and Cban.The recommendations to enable these three ports to.be fully utilised are set out in Appendix E.On the supposition that the improvements as therein set out. are made^ we estimate that these three ports could import, per annum as followsGlasgow 3,000,000 tonsjzf Greenock 500,000 tonsObah 150,000 tons.$ NOTE   If the ore traffic should be diverted from &apos;     the Clyde, the figures of the cereal importsinto:Glasgow, etc.. could be materially increased)H*     The Committee further suggest that both iti Ireland and in Scotland, Executive machinery should be established to carry out the recommendations of this Committee.8.    As the Committee are of opinion that the War Cabinet would net desire that this report should be burdened with a number- of Appendices deal iiig: with harb.oars; etc. that, are &amp;on-sidered unsuitab-3e on account of navigational difficulties, lack of resources from the point of view of discharge of ships, . transit arrangements, etc., ex.Cc, information on such points has been retained in .the Offices of the War Cabinet and can be produced at any time if BOc.-flfe3i$$-l-reaommend that no further flour, be imported into Ireland from Great, Britain, and the Chief Secretary for Ireland be requested to take the necessary steps to increase milling as requisite to meet Irish requirements, thus saving an -unnecessary use of shipping.Until the mills are able to meet all local requirements it is recommended that&apos; any shortage of flour be met by direct importation  rom abroad.4,    fe recommend that even before the suggested improve--ments at the ports are carried out, such use of the ports as is -immediately possible should /forthwith be made for the importa-tion of wheat at the following ports, i.e.yCorkFenitLimerick.5*     As it will take some little time to execute the works of improvement suggested in AppendixAA. at Queenstown, Cork -? Fenit.., and Limerick, and as the matter is urgent., it is recommends that plans and estimates for the proposed additions be at once prepared and the work taken in hand and completed as soon as practicable.
We have understood that in making suggestions we were only, to take into consideration ports which could he used by the late Autumn of 1917.     If, however, it was considered ad-visable to look ahead further than this we should recommend that important, works should be carried out on the Shannon below Limerick, probably in or near Foynes.     At   -these- places existing facilities are to6 small to be worth oohsideration:, hut with time good deep-water wharves could be put up here,&quot; and sufficient railway acoombdati On,provided.     If that were done the possibilities of bringing wheat into Ireland could be increased by about 250,006 tons per annum,     A comprehensive scheme, would, however, be necessary,- and even if it. were started immediately, it would probably be 12 or 14 months before it could be in working order.(Signed)STfcDAVIDS M.H.

APPENDIX   A.0TJE7JTSTOV/H.&quot;&quot;&quot; It is recommended that a line of rails should helaid on the deep water quay (about 800 feet long) adjoining the Railway Station, and certain minor alterations made to the Station itself.Fixed Cranes would be desirable *One of the two available quays must be provided with a railway line for a distance &apos;of about 1,000 feet.   Materials for laying it are on the spot.PENIT.There is an excellent deep water jetty 650 feet long with good rail accommodation, and it ia recommended that it should be lengthened 250 feet so that 2 steamers could be accommodated at the same time.    Two lines of rails must be laid on the extension.   Pour more cranes would be required, and they, and those at present there,  should be mounted on pedestals to allow wagcns to pass under them.LllSRIOKAs no Railway connection exists between the Station and the Q$:ays, a branch Railway about 3 miles long should be &quot;built to connect them with the Great Southern and Western main line .Plans for this proposed railway already exist, and It would take about thr^e months to build.APPENDIX &apos; 3. IML A pontoon barge about 50 feet by 35 f^et lon-* isrequired to enable ships to be berthed alongside and&quot; so utilise the existing pier.
