Confidential.Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee.   March 1917. RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.      &amp;German Post-War Economic Policy.IL-THE GERMAN RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.The controversy already described between the upholders of State control in industry and the advocates of private trading and &quot; free initiative &quot; came gradually to centre round the question of post-war organisation. As the war went on, and hopes of peace were continually frustrated, the imperative necessity of State control became more and more evident, but its working at the same time more and more irksome. As early as May 1915 the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce declared in a resolution that &quot;If at the end of a victorious war Germany&apos;s trade has been &quot; robbed of its independence and freedom by the introduction of State monopolies, &quot; England will have the right to claim the economic victory.&quot; The Government was urged to declare itself in the matter. It did so early in 1916 when the question was debated in the Budget Committee of the Reichstag, and Dr. Richter, the Under-Secretary of the Interior, made a speech, of which the following is a summary. He began by saying that, in his opinion, a trade war after the war was unlikely and that freedom of commerce must be restored as far as possible. He then proceeded to discuss the provision of the more imjjortant raw materials after the war. For this purpose he stated that it will be necessary to found industrial self-governing companies, on which the Government will be represented by a Commissioner. These companies will buy and distribute raw materials and will act as intelligence departments. &quot; The problem of foreign exchange,&quot; he added, &quot; will be solved by &quot; a limited export of gold, but better still by the barter of commodities, in which &quot; potash is destined to play an important part.&quot; This utterance clearly indicated that the Minister was attempting to steer a middle course in &quot;the prevailing controversy, but that the exact relationship between the State and the self-governing companies, which would necessarily be continued in the transition period, had not yet been decided.The next step taken by the Government in the matter is described in the following extract&apos;15: &quot;The Vossische Zeitung (July 25th) is informed from Hamburg that it has long been known in commercial circles that the Hamburg Senator, -. Dr. Sthamer, at present civil governor of Antwerp, had been designated as L: 1     the &apos; Imperial Commissioner for the Transition from War to Peace Economy.&apos; The confirmation of the news has given great satisfaction in Hamburg, being taken as an indication of a definite breach with the policy advocate 1 in -   v   some quarters that competitive trading should be eliminated as long as possible after the war, and that the centralisation of commercial activities in the hands of the State should be continued.   The certainty is now provided that while, of course, the existing centralisation cannot be suddenly discarded, it will not be retained longer than is absolutely necessary.&quot; It may be conjectured that one object, at any rate, of the appointment was to placate commercial interests centred at Hamburg and elsewhere, though how far the Commissioner would be able to meet such wishes could not be known even to those who appointed him.On August 5th the Reichsanzeiger issued an Order defining the particular function of the Commissioner to be that of &quot; regulating the import of goods and their distribution according to the instructions of the Imperial Chancellor,&quot; and empowering him &quot;to require all persons under the usual penalties to give information &quot; on economic questions, and to submit their business correspondence, their books,* W.T.LD.

&quot; and their warehouses,, to..-:inspection.?&quot;&apos;. On the -same day the well-informed Frank-furter Zeitung published&quot; a Berlin telegram denying the rumours that the new office Avas to be a permanent institution, or to develop into the Imperial Ministry of Commerce so much desired by trading and industrial opinion, t Its functions, it added, are in principle conceited as limited in&quot; duration; it is to disappear and free activity of trade is to be restored, so soon as the international market for goods returns to a normal condition. Commercial and industrial policy will continue, as hitherto, to be the province of the Ministry of the Interior.On September 25th the Journal of the Ministry of the Interior published the detailed regulations as to the Commissioner^ powers which made clear his relation to the Minister responsible for commercial and industrial policy. The new department is officially attached to the Ministry of the Interior, hut it is at the same time armed with very large independent powers. As the present Minister of the Interior, Dr. Helfferich, is also officially acting as the Imperial Chancellors deputy, the new Department is in close touch with the Chancellor himself. The organisation of the new Department is described as follows. It will &quot;be seen that it deals wholly, at present at any rate, with the question of the control &apos;of the commodities needed to restock the country with raw materials and to re-start its industries.The Imperial Commissioner puts forward requests to the Ministry of the Interior to be allowed to assume control of any raw material or commodity which he thinks it expedient to submit to such treatment. When its control is handed over to him he is empowered (1) to estimate the post-war demand for it; v(2) to see that it is provided for;(3) to arrange for its distribution amongst consumers.Under the second of these headings he is expressly authorised (1) to ascertain the amount already held, either as raw material, or in the manufactured state by individuals or syndicates (i.e., the War Companies already described). (Presumably this is intended to refer to stocks held by Germans, or bought on behalf of Germans by neutrals, in any part of the world);(2) to organise purchase on behalf of the State, either through, companies already existing, or by the formation of new ones, or through individuals;(3) to finance such purchasers;(4) to organise their transport by sea, rail, or inland waterways.The Commissioner is assisted by an Advisory Council consisting of represen-tatives of the &quot; highest departments of State &quot; (i.e., presumably the Admiralty and the Treasury as the Departments most closely concerned), and of the State. Govern-ments, and also of experts. The Council is nominated by the Imperial Chahcellon, but the names of experts are put forward to the Commissioner, and, as a rule, each one of the companies mentioned above is represented on the Council by one of its &quot;experts.&quot; The Council is presided, over by the Secretary of State for the Interior, and in his absence (i.e., normally speaking) by the Imperial Commissioner, who is thus, in effect, placed in a super-departmental position.The main work of the Council is done through Committees. It is empowered to form Committees &quot; to deal with single raw materials or commodities, or with several raw materials and commodities together,&quot; and also to deal with questions of finance and transport. Every Committee is to include not less than one member of the companies already mentioned as dealing with raw materials. The Imperial Commis-sioner has power to appoint any outside person on to a Committee. Members of the Council, other than experts, are to be invited to all meetings of the Committees and have the right of giving the Imperial Commissioner notice of subjects to be placed on the agenda. This provision is clearly intended to safeguard the susceptibilities of the Federal Departments of State, and also more particularly of the State Govern-ments, with whom so many difficulties have arisen in the course of the existing system of military control.The regular work of the new Department is to be carried on by Assistant Commissioners, not exceeding, ten in all, appointed, with definite duties, by the Imperial Chancellor on the proposal of the Imperial Commissioner.   The Assistant............ * Daily Notes, August 14th, 1916.f E.ff. by Wertheim in Das Falsche System, page 68.
Commissioners are to meet regularly Oil the invitation of the Imperial Commissioner, and each of them is to propose to the Imperial Commissioner the members Of the Committee dealing with the article or articles on which his department is engaged.It will thus be seen that the Imperial Commissioner is armed with very wide powers, if he cares to use them. While careful measures have been taken to keep him in contact with the regular Departments and State Governments, he is definitely placed above them. So long as he enjoys the confidence of the Imperial Chancellor and his deputy he is in a position to ride rough-shod over local or private or other official interests. Dr. Hellferich stated on October 14th that eight Assistant Commissioners had already been appointed, representative of Finance, Shipping, Commerce, and the leading industries.It is evident, however, that the Reichstag is anxious not to relax its hold over the arrangements for Economic Reconstruction, and is endeavouring, as in the parallel case of the Patriotic Auxiliary Service Law, to force the Government to take it into its confidence. The following reports relating to meetings of the Reichstag Committee concerned are the best available commentary on the progress of the work of the new Department. The first is taken from the official Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung for Sunday, October 15th, 1916.   Italics as in the original: &quot; The Reichstag Committee for Trade and Industry met on Saturday, as already briefly reported, to discuss the problems of the transition from war conditions to peace conditions. The proceedings were confidential. Those present included the Secretary of State, Dr. Helfferich, the Imperial Commissioner for the Transition, Senator Sthamer, Dnder Secretary Dr. Richter, and a number&apos; of Commissioners from the Ministry of the Interior.&quot; Secretary of State Dr. Ilelfferich spoke for an hour and a half on the general economic position of the country, dealing with the effects of the war Upon it, and with the measures planned and already partly executed by the Government for the transition period.   These measures are mainly matters of organisation.&quot;The transition from war to peace involves three great groups of questions: demobilisation (the labour question), credit, and the provision of raw materials. Each of these three problems can be sub-divided into numerous subsidiary problems. The war has brought about an immense transformation in the economic life of the country, and the process of. re-adjustment to peace conditions on the basis of free economic initiative cannot take place without a substantial upheaval. The experiences of war will prove of good service in this connection. The re-adjustment will only be accomplished gradually, and with the aid of legislation,, of the administrative bodies and of the free economic forces. New forms of organisation are necessary,, especially as regards the carrying through, of the technical economic details of the transition economy. On the basis of the powers granted by a law of August 4th, 1914, a decree had. been issued for the establishment of an Imperial Commissioner ship for the Transition Economy and its establishment had. been proceeded with.&quot; The Committee resolved to discuss the whole group of subjects mentioned together with the Reichstag Standing Committee for the Regulation of Business anld to start work at once on the raw material question.&quot; The; representative Of the Centre (Roman. Catholic) Party summed up the problems to be dealt with as- follows : &quot; (1) The transition from war to peace economy.&quot; (2) The-- establishment of a. peace economic&apos; system.&quot;(3) The working, out and organisation of a war economic plan.*   The two last named subjects&apos;are, of course, matters for the future.* This is a subject which has been much discussed in? Germany in-recent months: At a meeting of the Executive of the German Handelstag (corresponding to our Association of- Chambers of- Commerce) on August 9th, T916, a resolution was adopted in favour of the establishment-of &quot;An Economic General Staff or War1 Economic Department.&quot; The following extract from the&quot; printed report of one of the speeches (by Dr. Hiiuser, of Hochst) is worth citing :   ,&quot; It is untrue to say, as is sometimes said, that no steps were taken beforehand to prepare for the war on its economic side. It. should not&apos; be forgotten that iw May I9!14v 01il tbfe&apos; initiative of the Government, the Ministry of. the&quot; Interior, summoned a conference of representatives of- commerce agriculture and large and small industries to discuss, in collaboration with the departmental autho-ritiesr the economic questions arising, out of War. Those present were confident&apos; as to&apos; our&apos; economic preparedness even&apos; with England- against us and with, a blockade of&apos; the North Sea. They reckoned, however,; on. the war being, over within a year and did not anticipate that England would exert- such pressure upon neutrals.&quot;//.  2656-1 &apos; A 2
&quot; The National Liberal representative expressed the wish that the Ministry of the Interior would hear the views of the Committee before final decisions were taken.&quot; A wish was expressed from various sides that representatives of all the interests affected, agriculture, the middle classes, artisans, &amp;c, should be associated with the new organisations.&quot;The Social Democrats proposed that the Committee for Trade and Industry should be allowed to meet during the adjournment of the Reichstag. No decision was reached on the proposal, which was opposed by the Secretary of State.&quot;The next extract relates to a further meeting of the Committee which took place during the adjournment of the Reichstag in January. It is taken from the Vossiche Zeitung for January 11th, 1917 : &quot; The Reichstag Committee for Trade and Industry, which is presided over by the Centre representative, Dr. Mayer (Kauf beuren), will take up its wrork again shortly. The Committee will devote its chief attention to the important question of provision of raw materials. A. mass of valuable information on the subject has been laid before it. Every industry or group of industries has made known its wishes, because it is a question of taking measures in good time. In order to secure an expert treatment of all these questions, which intimately affect the economic life of the country, the Committee has divided the material into several sections and appointed reporters to deal with them.   The following is the arrangement adopted : &quot; (1) Demand :-&quot; (a) Raw materials, manufactured and semi-manufactured articles : &quot;reporter Muller (Fulda, Centre), assisted by Jaeckel (Soc.);&quot;(b) Foodstuffs and fodder: reporter, Schiele (Conserv.), assisted by Hoffmann (Kaiserslautern, Soc.) and Bartschat (Progr.). &quot; (2) Tonnage : reporter Carstens (Progr.), assisted by Freiherr von Richthofen (Nat. Lib.).&quot; (3) Foreign Exchange : reporters Dr. Riesser (Nat. Lib.) and Count Schwerin(Lowitz, Conserv.), assisted by Cohen (Reuss, Soc.). &quot; (4) Distribution, organisation and financing of the export trade : reporter, Dr. Stresemann (Nat. Lib.), assisted by Dove (Progr.) and Irl (Centre). &quot;(5) Labour: reporters, Molkenbuhr (Soc.) and Becker (Arnsverg. Centre).&quot;It is clear from this, especially from the tasks entrusted to Socialist Majority members, how closely all parties are working together in the Reichstag. How much influence, however, the investigations and decisions of the Reichstag Com-mittee are exerting or will exert on the administration is still uncertain. The most important administrative step since taken by the Government in regulating post-bellum policy was the issue of a Bundesrat Order on February 8th for the further control of foreign exchange dealing, which was issued without parliamentary sanction or official consultation. The measure in question is not specifically stated to be extended to cover the post-bellum period, but its continuance rests with the Imperial Chancellor, and the Frankfurter Zeitung is probably correct in regarding it as a piece of transition period economy. Its most important provision is thus summarised in Daily Notes, February 28th, 1917 :-&quot; The assent of the Reichsbank must be secured to the incurring of indebtedness to foreign countries for purchase of goods, securities, objects of art or luxury, real property or ships ; or to their acquisition in exchange for securities, coupons, or documents entitling to shares in profits. Such assent must also be secured to the granting of a new credit in marks to any foreign country.0 Claims on foreign countries payable in marks may only be disposed of, otherwise than by mere collection (&apos;Einziehung&apos;), by assent of the Reichsbank. These provisions put an end to all uncontrolled export of German exchange in foreign countries. In particular, purchase of goods for post-bellum deliveries are made impossible.&quot;No doubt the operation of the decree is mitigated by a system of licences; but it is evident that a very strict measure of trade-control during the transition period has already been agreed upon.A further meeting of the Reichstag Committee was held on February 28, when the Imperial Commissioner laid a report before it on the progress of his work.* The Frankfurter Zeitung thinks that mark credits to the amount of several hundred millions have been granted in Germany during the War to private persons in foreign countries ; and that this was a chief source of the excessive supply of marks which has depressed the value of the mark on the foreign markets.
The points reported on included the exchange problem, the problem of tonnage, the distribution of home and foreign raw materials, the employment of demobilised workers, and the question of food rations, which are to be continued for some time after peace is signed. In view of the present situation, the Imperial Commissioner declared that it would be impossible to formulate a definite programme for several months yet.It was the general feeling that the Committee should co-operate with the Imperial Commissioner in the preliminary labours, and that the Committee should be regularly furnished with reports as to the progress of those labours. The Commissioner agreed that it was advisable for him to be in touch with the Committee, and a motion was adopted placing this understanding on record. The motion . stated that a promise was made to the Committee that before any definite decision was taken on important questions of reconstruction the Committee would be given an opportunity of expressing an opinion on them. A second resolution adopted was in the following terms : &quot; The Committee expressed its special desire that representatives of workers and employees of all schools of thought should be nominated to the Advisory Council on Reconstruction.&quot; As regards the power of the proposed Raw Material Distribution Companies and the use of the purchases of raw material already made, the Commissioner declared that he looked forward to the Distribution Companies being independent bodies set up within each industry, under the supervision of the Commissioner.   In the distribution of supplies it would be impossible to eliminate the trading element, but speculative buyers should regard it as their duty not only to look to their own interests but to consider the necessity of keeping the whole industry employed.   They would be indemnified for the risks they were undertaking.*It thus appears that plans for the purchase and subsequent distribution of raw materials are well forward, and also that the Imperial Commissioner has been allowed considerably to extend the original scope of his Department.* Daily Notes, March 13, 1917.
