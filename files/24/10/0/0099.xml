MOST SECRET.

For the information of the War Cabinet.

From the First Sea Lord.

In connection with the concluding sentence of paragraph 3 of the Memorandum of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (01/95/274) of the 17th April, 1917, on the subject of the resumption of control over our forces, I desire to draw the serious attention of the War Cabinet to the absolute necessity of a definite approval being given for such operations as are necessary to effect the clearance mentioned.

The disadvantages of the present situation are obvious. At any moment the Germans can base on Belgian ports a force of Destroyers of greater strength than anything with which we can oppose it, if they carry out a night attack on our cross-channel communications. They also threaten directly the large assembly of merchant ships which are anchored nightly in the Downs; and they have an excellent advanced post for aerial offensive operations. Apart from all this, the ports form also - as is well known - a nest for submarines; and their operations, particularly those of the mine-layers, are a very serious menace to our Channel and East Coast traffic.

It is, therefore, of the very first importance that the situation should be cleared up before next Winter, and this cannot be done except by military operations.

18th April, 1917.
