WAR CAB HOT.TREATMENT OF PRISONERS OF WAR.^S^&amp;ote by the Secretary of State for WarI have made enquiries, as directed, with regard to the non-delivery of parcels to Prisoners of War in Germany.     There are apparently a considerable number of officers ^and men who have escaped into Holland, and to judge from certain Press telegrams which have been stopped., all information is to the same effect, namely, that all parcels are being stopped and apparently the food is being eaten by the Germans, the reason given being that it is as a reprisal for the employment of their prisoners behind our lines . Enquiry as to whether parcels have in fact been withheld has been made by the Foreign Office, but no reply has yet been received.With regard to the latter the War Cabinet will remember what the position is.     At the conference held with M. Ribot, K. Thomas, and other French representatives, it was agreed that the demand made by the kerrmn Government that prisoners should only be employed 30 kilometres behind the line should be refused and that they should be employed as heretofore - the conditions being that they should be out of shell-fire and should not be employed on defensive works or the handling of munitions.     The War Cabinet will remember that the French-Ministers were most insistent that the German demand should be rejected.     They had hardly got back to Francia before^ they informed us that public opinion in Erance was too strong and they had decided to give way to the German request.     I spoke to the Prime Minister on the subject and he instructed me that the War Cabinet1 e decision Y/as to stand until I heard to the contrary.I have not yet been able to ascertain what action the French Government have actually taken.     I think, however, in view of these reprisals on the part of Germany I must ask for definite instructions as to whether or no the present procedure with regard to the employment of German prisoners is to continue. Sir Douglas Haig reports that he could employ them at 30 kilometres behind the line, but of course it would be most inconvenient, especially at the moment when we want all the labour we can possibly get for repairing the railways up ,to our present Front and this would come well within the 30 kilometre limit.There are certain aspects of the case which must be considered -(l) If we now give way it will be evident that we have done so because of the reprisals taken on our prisoners by withholding all food parcels.(2) On the other hand there is no doubt that our prisoners are being practically starved as instanced by the report Corres-pondcnt from G.H.Q/. in the Times of the 14th April.(3&quot;)&apos;   &quot;When the condition of our men and the cause of it is known and the public learn &quot;that the French have complied with the German demands, it seems not unlikely that public opinion will be so stirred as to make it necessary to rectifytheee conditions by withdrawing German prisoners to the 30 kilometre limit.J
I should also like an instruction as to whether we should not immediately stop all parcels coming to prisoners of war in this country and cut down the rations issued to them, both here and in Prance, to the barest minimum, but this will mean a serious reduction in the Talue of their labour.Sir Starr Jameson has telephoned to me that he under-stands that the whole of the postal arrangements in Germany are completely broken    -down, and that this&quot;nay be the cause for the non-delivery of the parcels.     I doubt this myself.     At the same time it 13 confirmed in this Office that apparently the postal system has broken down as stated.J.ERBY I .April,  1917.
