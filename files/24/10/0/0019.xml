(&quot;This Document is the Prousrty of Mis Britannic Majesiys Governn^nl]      82Printed for the use of the Cabinet.   February 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.MEMOBANDUM.IN order to consider more clearly the policy pursued during&apos; the past few months by His Majesty&apos;s Government knd the French Government in regard to Greece, and to understand the underlying divergences of action and intention which have from the first existed between them, it will be convenient to divide the period under review into three distinct phases. . The first of these phases would date from the acceptance by the Greek Government of the Allied Note of the 21st June, and would terminate with the fall of the Zaimis Cabinet on the 11th September. The second phase would begin with the (ql-reek offer of alliance of the 4th September, and would end with the disembarkation of the 1st December. The last phase would begin with the Blockade, and end with the Conference of Rome.During the whole of this period His Majesty&apos;s Government were guided by the ultimate ideal pf a united Greece, directed by a representative Government and a Constitutional King? and attaining by its pwn efforts and of its own free will to. a full realisation of national Greek traditions and national Greek interests.During the first phase of the period His Majesty&apos;s Government endeavoured to approximate to this ideal by giving a free scope to the Government of M. Zaimis, and by fostering an atmosphere in which the elections which were then &quot;impending could be carried put without prejudice, and without either internal or external interference. During the second phase flis Majesty&apos;s Government welepmed, with caution, indeed., but not without confidence, the Grepk offer of co-operation, and hoped to find therein a definite solution of the problem of Greek unity which at that stage had become insoluble by.any but radical means.During the third phase they have for the moment abandoned all hope of a United Greece and concentrated their efforts upon securing a united Allied policy towards Greece, coupled with the security of the Armee d&apos;Orient and of the transport routes bv which that army is supplied.The French Government, on the other hand, appear, in spite of their many official utterances to the contrary, to have deliberately fostered those internal dissensions which it wras the aim of His Majesty5s Government to allay. During the first period His Majesty&apos;s Government were continually hampered bj the persistent attempts of the French to force a rupture with Greece; during the seepnd our efforts were rendered abortive by the disinclination of the French Government to induce King Constantine to take the only decision which would have rendered possible a reconciliation, if hot with M. Yenizelos himself, at least with the liberal and progressive elements in the country; wrnereas during the third phase it has become abundantly evident that His Majesty&apos;s Govem-ment can have no confidence that the French local authorities will loyally execute the policy which the two Governments have now concerted.In a word, during the first period wp attpmpted to ajlow the  rreek people to shape the destinies of their own country, while the French insisted on a policy of interference and irritation. During-the second period we were prepared to take definite action to bring Greece into the war, whereas f,he French, refused to support usr[264] B
and continued their policy of pin-pricks, whereby Greek opinion -was gradually alienated from our cause, and our position as regards neutral opinion was rendered unjustifiable.and somewhat ridiculous.First Period June 21 to September 11.The resignation of the Skoloudis Cabinet, the acceptance of the Allied demands of the 21st June, and the accession to power of M. Zaimis, gave good ground for the hope that a satisfactory basis had been established for future amicable relations with Greece.His Majesty&apos;s Government were of opinion that the policy to be adopted was to give the Za&apos;imis Cabinet a fair chance of undoing 145155. some of the harm which had been occasioned by its predecessors, and they had every hope that with new elections a really national Government would be returned which would enable the Greek nation to work out its own salvation.The French Government assured us, indeed, that this was also their policy, and in reviewing the attitude which they intended to adopt, they characterised it as a determination to &quot; menager avec soin 1&apos;amour-propre du peuple hellenique.&quot; 166315.In practice, however, the action taken by their naval and military authorities in Greece did not concord with these protesta-tions, and. it was soon clear that General Sarrail did not propose to behave with that moderation which the existing conditions demanded.The occupation of Salonica had created a situation which in any case required the exereise of infinite patience in dealing with local Greek affairs, and the conduct of General Sarrail was not such as to diminish ihe humiliation which Greek public opinion felt at the presence of the Allied Armies on Greek soil.Arrest of Greek officers by General Sarrail,Shortly after the accession to power of the Zaimis Government 128675. (namely, on the 2nd July), an attack was made by certain junior Greek officers at Salonica on the editorial offices of a Venizelist paper, and General Sarrail proceeded himself to arrest these officers and only delivered them to the Greek authorities upon our representing the resentment which his action would cause in Greece and the embarrassment which it occasioned to M. Zaimis.Suggested Naval Demonstration.At the same time the French Government suggested that an Allied naval demonstration should be made at the moment when the elections were to take place, and they only abandoned this 131040. suggestion in deference to our earnest^wishes.Crisis of August 24s.There were indications &quot;also that the French representatives at Athens were reporting to their Government that the Allied demands0 of the 21st June were not being executed with the 139963. necessary promptitude, and an atmosphere of some tension already existed when reports were received at the end of August that a coup was being meditated in Macedonia, and that the Germans, in collusion with the Greek General Staff, were about to invade Thessaly.* These demands were 1. Complete demobilisation of the Greek Army.2. Immediate constitution of a Government willing to observe a friendly neutrality.3. Immediate dissolution of Chamber of Deputies followed by a General Election.4. The dismissal of certain police officials.
165856. a These reports, which appeared to emanate from other thanFrench sources, were sufficiently circumstantial to cause grave apprehension, and a meeting took place between.Mr. Asquith and M. Briand at Calais on the 24th August to discuss the situation as it then stood.It was decided at this meeting to await confirmation of these alarmist reports before proceeding to forcible action. It appears, 170302. however, that on his return frorn Calais M. Briand was overruled by his colleagues in the Council of Ministers, and the next we heard was that the French Fleet had been ordered to Salamis, and that a landing of Allied troops was contemplated.Salonica Revolution.The immediate sequence of events is of some importance, as it suggests the strongest suspicion that General Sarrail had planned a rising in Athens to coincide with an Allied disembarkation and with the military revolution at Salonica, which actually took place a few days later (1st September). It is possible, indeed, that M. Briand did not*know of this at the time of his meeting with Mr. Asquith, and that his subsequent reversion to a policy of violence was due to pressure put upon him by his colleagues.On learning the instructions which had been sent to the French fleet we telegraphed a strong protest to Paris, and wereX69180. informed in reply that, although the fleet had been diverted to Milo pending definite instructions, yet the French Government were convinced that the situation was one of grave danger, and that they were of opinion that the Allied Governments should at once insist on taking over the Greek posts and telegraphs, and that they should171709. send a brigade to Athens to enforce their demands. His Majesty&apos;s Government pointed out that to send a large force would be impos-sible, and to send a small one would be dangerous, and Sir F.172661.      Elliot advised us at the same time that the despatch of the fleet to .172662.      Salamis would not produce the results expected.Arrival of Fleet at Salamis.Meanwhile, however, and before Sir F. Elliot&apos;s advice could be considered, the French Admiral had arrived with his fleet at Salamis, and from this moment the situation is largely dominated and harrassed by the activity of Admiral du Fournet at the Pirasus in co-operation with General Sarrail at Salonica.Although this action on the part of the French Government led to no actual disaster, and though the French Admirals demands, which included the expulsion of enemy agents and the control of Greek posts and telegraphs, were accepted without demur by the Greek Government, vet this intervention into which we were rushed by the French Government definitely compromised the position of M. Zaimis and destroyed all hope of attaining to a solution of the question by pacific and natural means. The effect of the inter-vention of Boumania was, moreover, marred by the impression produced by this fresh humiliation on the Government of Athens.The temporary calm which followed this storm was marked by assurances given by M. Briand to Lord Bertie and to Mr. Lloyd George to the effect that the French Government did not cherish any anti-dynastic designs as regards Greece, and that General 174441.      SarraiFs instructions were to the effect that he should exercise 175728.      &quot;the greatest circumspection, moderation, and tact, and should not adopt any strong measures not absolutely.necessary from a military point of view.&quot;   These assurances were, however, followed before long by two further &quot; incidents&quot; which the French Government magnified out of all proportion, namely, the suspected use of the wireless station at Athens and the hostile demonstration carried out &apos; at the French Legation by certain Greek reservists.
Further protests in regard to these incidents were addressed to M. Zaimis, who, feeling evidently that he was unable to cope with a situation of such bitter complexity, tendered his resignation.Second Period, September 4 to December 1.Greek Offer of Alliance, September 4.Some few days before his resignation, however, M. Zaiimis had made, whether with, the consent of his Cabinet is not quite clear, a tentative offer of an alliance between Greece and the Entente Powers.   His Majesty&apos;s Government, while realising  that this 175797, might be a mere manoeuvre to gain time, considered that the 176260. offer presented a favourable opportunity for securing a definite and 178774. creditable solution of the Greek problem, and they at once suggested to the French  Government that a reply should be returned asking Ring Constantine to declare war upon Bulgaria by a specified date, and to appoint a National Ministry to give effect to this declaration.   The French   Government  gave  a somewhat 191815. grudging assent to this proposal, but it was soon clear that they had no  desire to  give  effect to  their concurrence.   On the 80th Septpmber they informed us that the creation of a Venizelist Government at Salonica had introduced an entirely new element into the  situation, and that it was now probable, and indeed preferable, that the King should declaim war upon Bulgaria of his 197887. own  accord and without external pressure.   They suggested, therefore, that the proposed intimation should not be delivered.Meanwhile, the policy of petty intervention and pin-pricks pursued by the local French representatives continued, and the French Admiral endeavoured to induce Sir F. Elliot to consent to the increase of the Allied Guards who had been landed as a result of the demonstration at the French Legation (see p. 3). We took this occasion to warn the French Government that it was essential that His Majesty?s Government should be informed, and have time 199613. to discuss, measures which the Admiral proposed to take before any drastic action was undertaken.Meanwhile, the Allied Representatives at Athens addressed an identic telegram to their Governments urging that some reply 200610. should be returned to the Greek offer of alliance, and we suarsjested that the Greek Ministers in London and Paris should be told that their Government must immediately declare that a state of war existed with Bulgaria.The French Government replied to this suggestion by entering 203312. upon a discussion as to the exact formula in which this intimation 206358. should be conveyed to the Greek Government, but meanwhile the action of their representatives in Greece continued to indicate a desire to force a rupture.Seizure of Greek Fleet.It was at this stage that the French Admiral, without con-suiting us, demanded the surrendpr of the Greek Fleet, on which wp 202378 addressed an energetic protest to the French Government disclaim-ing all responsibility for what might follow.Conference of Boulogne, October 20. .The complete contradiction which existed between the intpn-tions of the French Government, as expressed in Paris, and the actions of their officers was such that Lord Bertie reminded M. Briand on the 7th October that any proposals for landing men 200464. at Athens must be discussed between the three Governments. It appeared, indeed, from the decisions of the Conference of Boulogne, which was held on the 20th October, that a certain unanimity ot action and intention would now be secured.
Unfortunately, however, this hope was not fulfilled. The main decision come to at Boulogne was, that in reply to the Greek offer of alliance the Greek Government should be informed that the - only wav in which thev could convince the Allied Governments of their good intentions would be by immediate declaration of war on Bulgaria. A note in this sense was handed to the Greek Minister in London on the 23rd October, but similar action was not taken in Paris: and it was onlv some davs later that we learnt that M. Benazefs conversations with the King had induced the French. Government to reverse the decisions come to at Boulogne.M. Benazet.From this moment the clear issue as to whether the Greek Government would or would not carry out their offer of alliance became obscured by the negotiations initiated by M. Benazet with-out our knowledge or consent, and tending rather to reduce the ,Greek army to a position of impotence than to secure its co-opera-tion as an Ally.Before considering, however, the extent to which these negotia-tions of M. Benazet, and the subsequent arrangement come to on the 14th November by General Boques, led directly to the disaster of the 1st December, it may be useful to record two further occasions on which, during this period, the French Government, or their officers, acted independently of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Expulsion of Enemy Legations in Greece.The first occasion was furnished by the measures taken for the; expulsion of the enemy Legations at Athens, when the impulsive action of the French Admiral might, if the enemy Ministers had had the courage to resist, have landed us in an impossible position. As it happened the affair passed off without incident, and it must he observed that the French Government could reply with truth that Admiral du Fournet had consulted the Allied Ministers before taking action even if his Government did not obtain the views and consent of their Allies.Status of Venizelist Forces.A more justifiable cause of complaint is provided by the action taken by the French Government as regards the status of the Venizelist forces.   We had, ourselves, very definite views on this241308. question, and we enquired of the French Government as to the attitude which they themselves considered should be adopted, pointing out that the declaration of war on Bulgaria by the Venizelist Government appeared to render impossible the incor-poration of the Venizelist forces as volunteers in the- Allied armies. To this enquiry they returned no reply, and we were informed some days later that General Sarrail had already announced that those259274. Venizelist forces as were likely to come into contact with the qnemy were to be regarded as being attached to the Allied armies; an announcement in which, if we had been consulted, we would, for the above reason, very probably not* have concurred.The Events of December 1.Meanwhile M. Briand had explained to. the Allied Bepre-sentafives at the Conference of Paris: QUi the 15th -November, the actual scope of M. Benazefs negotiations, and. these negotiations were in the interval taken up by General Boques on his passage through- Athens, with the result that on. the 16th, is oyember Admiral du Fournet embodied in an official note to the Greek Government a definite, request for the surrender of armament equivalent to that which had been taken by the Bulgarians.[264] &apos; &quot; 0
The Greek Government replied by a direct refusal, which was met by the French Admiral by a demand for the surrender of the guns by the 1st December, failing which he intended to land Allied detachments at Athens. On the receipt of this information we telegraphed at once to Paris to the effect that we would await the views of the French Government before commenting on Admiral du Fournefs proposals, and we were informed in reply that the French Government had &quot; already authorised&quot; their: Admiral 237262. to take action in the sense suggested. 241292.It appears.at first sight therefore that we have a Very strong case against the French Government in regard to the disaster of the 1st December, but it should be observed (1), that we had not disapproved of M. Benazet&apos;s negotiations when we had the oppor-tunity of doing so at the Conference of Paris; (2), that we knew of, but did not protest against, the action which the French Admiral proposed to take a week before it was timed to take effect; and (3), that we informed the Greek Minister, as we were indeed bound to do, that the French demands had the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Third Period-December 2 to January 4.The events of the 1st December placed the whole Greek situ-ation on a fresh basis, and it then became necessary to abandon all hope of Greek unity, and to think only of presenting a united front in the face of the immediate urgency of obtaining adequate reparation and guarantees.From the first, however, the French rendered this co-ordination of action exceptionally difficult.The Blockade.An instance of this lack of co-ordination is to be found in the French publication of the Declaration of Blockade. We were anxious, for legal reasons, to consider with all care the exact form in which this announcement should be made, and, indeed, we endeavoured at the last moment, but in vain, to induce the French-Government to defer publication in Paris until we should have had time to give the matter full consideration.General Sarrail.The most flagrant instance, however, in which the French Government have endeavoured to &quot;rush&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment into action of which they did not approve, and in which they eluded and even falsified the decisioutcome to at a joint Conference, was in connection with the discretion to be allowed to General Sarrail to take military action against Greece.As a result of the events of the 1st and 2nd December wre learnt that General Sarrail, who had now been placed in supreme control, was threatening to bombard Athens and to take immediate military action.   We therefore telegraphed to Paris on the 10th December, urging that immediate instructions should be sent to General Sarrail not to take any such action, and were informed that he had been instructed accordingly.   On the 23rd December, however, we again 249382. learnt that General Sarrail was endeavouring to provoke a rupture, and, in reply to our protest, the French informed us that the moment had come to give General Sarrail a &quot;free hand,&quot; as they 260875. had evidence of an impending military coup on the part of the 262622. Athens Government.Conference at London.As a result of this conflict of opinion a Conference was held in London, and it was decided to send Allied Military Commissions to
265087. 140.2029. 3873.Greece, who would report on the manner in which the Greek Government were conducting the promised evacuation. If this 262968. report were unfavourable General Sarrail might then propose to the Allied Governments the course of action he considered necessary.On the 30th, however, we heard that General Sarrail was marching on Kozani, having &apos;: received a telegram from the French Minister which he construed as containing an ultimatum from the Greek Government.&quot;In reply to our request for an explanation of this departure from the decisions of the London Conference, the French. Govern-ment, while making no, mention of the Greek &quot; ultimatum &quot; alleged by General Sarrail, again stated that they had evidence of an impending Greek coup against the flank of the Armee d&apos;Orient.Meanwhile the French Ambassador at Petrograd had read to the&quot; Prussian Minister for Foreign Affairs a telegram from his Government to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been consulted as regards this action on the part of General Sarrail  which was, of course, untrue. It also transpired that the Russian Government had been furnished bv the French Government with a wholly incorrect version of the London Decisions.In view of this extreme divergence of eviews it was decided to summon an Allied Conference at Rome, at which General Sarrail should he present in person, and it is the decisions of this Con-ference which now govern the situation.It is to be feared, however, that the Conference at Rome made little impression on the conduct of the French Government and General Sarrail, since it was not long before we heard that they had occupied Mount Athos, without consulting us and in contradiction 21835/16. to their own previous decision conveyed to Lord Bertie on the 3rd Fehruarv, 1916, that Mount Athos should remain its former status. A telegram was, moreover, received on the 22nd January reporting an attempt on the part of General Sarrail to extend the southern limit of the neutral zone in violation of the spirit of the Rome decisions, and a general feeling of apprehension has persisted that General Sarrail has no intention of abiding by the spirit, or even the letter, of the agreements come to between the two Governments. It appears, also, from reports which have only just been received that General Sarrail is unwilling to carry out the decisions of the London Conference regarding the status of the Allied Military Controls, and that he now desires to place the Control Officers, not under his own direction as formerly arranged, but under the supervision of the French Legation at Athens.Conclusion.It will be seen from the above summary that the treatment of the Greek problem has been rendered inconsequent and ineffective owing to an essential, if unexpresed, divergence of policy, and to the effect which this divergence has produced upon the French Executive Officers in Greece.The French desired Allied intervention following upon Greek dissension; we hoped for Greek unity culminating in an Anglo-Greek Alliance.The two policies were mutually contradictory, and, when entrusted to General Sarrail, proved mutually destructive.It would, however, be difficult to base upon these essential issues any representations which it may be desired to make to the French Government. We may ourselves be convinced that the French intended on the 30th August to present their Allies with the triple fait accompli of a landing at the Piraeus, a revolution at Athens, and a &quot; pronunciamento&quot; at Salonica; we may he con-vinced that, their refusal in the early autumn to take up the Greek offer of Alliance was due to a desire to prolong the internal troubles
of Greece; but our convictions on these points are. based necessarily on inference rather than on fact, and it would be easy for the French Government to proffer a technical defence to which we would find it difficult, if not impossible, to reply.As regards minor issues, however, we are on less controversial ground. We could point out that the Conferences of Calais, Boulogne, London, and even Eome$ were followed by action on the part of the French Government and officials which was directly opposed to the decisions of those Conferences. We could observe that on three separate occasionsthe impulsive behaviour of the French Admiral exposed us to the risk, and in the last case to. the humiliation, of a serious disaster. And we could show how the French Government and their subordinates have taken action involving their Allies,J of which His Majesty&apos;s Government, would not, if they had been consulted, havevapproved, and the only result of which has been to diminish the confidence which His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto reposed in the advantage and efficacy of personal conferences between the Allied Cabinets.11.
