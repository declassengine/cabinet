ESOPOTAMIAN ADMINISTRATION  COMMITTEE. DRAFT  REPORT  OF  COMMITTEE.I. We submit the following recommendations :  1. That the occupied territories in Mesopotamia, consisting at the present moment of the greater parts of the Basra and Bagdad Vilayets, although they are at present and must for the time being remain in military occupation, should in the future be administered not by the Indian Government but by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;2. That, in view of the pledges that have already been given, and of the political interests involved, it will be necessary that the territory approxi-mately contained in the Basra Vilayet should remain permanently under British administration.o. That the boundaries of the region in question should be approximately a line drawn from Nasirieh, along the Shat-el-Hai through Kut-el-Amara to Bedrai on the west; along; the Persian frontier (Pusht-i-Kuh) to the borders of Khuzistan and Arabistan on the north-east and east; and the present boundaries of the Basra Vilayet on the south.4. That it would be premature to fix: at present the exact northern or western boundaries of the Bagdad Vilayet, but that the region to be controlled from thence should be approximate^ that coloured in the map attached, to the Anoio-Franco-Russian Agreement of 1916.5. That the Holy Places, Nejef, Kerbela and Kazimain will thus remain in the Arab sphere and not be placed directly under British control. It was noted, that the Shiahsof India would be much perturbed at the establishment of a British Protectorate over the territory containing the Holy Places of their faith.We desire to Jay stress on the importance of including in the future administrative area of the State or Province of Bagdad all the land irrigated, or to be irrigated, by the existing or future canal, system of Mesopotamia. The Hindia barrage and the canals fed from it are in the neighbourhood of the Shiah shrines, which it is proposed to treat as separate enclaves to be excluded from British direct control. In delimiting these enclaves the objection to including in. them any land falling within the limits of the canal system should be carefully borne in mind. We also consider that, whatever form of separate administration is set up in the Bagdad Vilayet, the control of irrigation in the two Vilayets (Bagdad and Basra) should be in the hands of a single British authority.6. Form of Arab Administration in Bagdad Vilayet. We uuder-stancl the present position to be that the &quot;Irak Code,&quot;.which contains the law in force in the Basra Vilayet, extends automatically to all additional territory occupied since the code was introduced. We consider that this code will not be found appropriate to the conditions of the Bagdad Vilayet if, as is contemplated, this territory is to be administered as far as possible on Arab lines. The right course, in our opinion, would be to maintain the local judicial system as far as possible, both in civil and criminal matters, and both as regards the substance of the law and the official personnel, subject to such modifications, in substance and in nomenclature as may be found necessary (e.g., the substitution of Arabic for Turkish official titles, wherever the latter are in use). The same principle should be followed in constituting the executive Government and the machinery of administration. The existing land-revenue system should be left as far as possible undisturbed, while the tribal system of government, the provincial and local councils, and the old official organisation (Turks being replaced by Arabs) should be&apos; maintained. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be to administer the Vilayet as an Arab province, so far as possible by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions. In this way no insuper-able obstacles would be created to its ultimate inclusion, under British control, in an Arab State or Confederacy; and the promises given in Sir Stanley Maude&apos;s proclamation would thus be made good. The employment of Indians in any branch of the administration of the Vilayet is inconsistent with this policy, and should therefore be strictly discountenanced.   NoS 355   40   3/17
Asiatics from outside the Vilayet, should be employed in the administration unless of Persian or Arab descent or domicile,The same considerations should apply as far as.possible to the adminis-tration of the Basra Vilayet.In pursuance of the above policy, it would seem desirable to resuscitate, under British auspices, whatever may remain of the provincial and municipal councils that existed in the Vilayet under the Turkish regime.7. That it will be desirable to place the political control of Koweit under the suggested British administration of the Basra Vilayet,8. Headquarters of Government.  We consider that the title and place of residence of the Head of the Mesopotamian Administration must depend to some extent on the future status of the Basra Vilayet. If that Vilayet does not become British territory, the importance of Bagdad as a capital city, and the probability that the affairs of the Bagdad Vilayet will occupy the greater part of the time and attention of the Head of the Administration, point to locating him at Bagdad. A solution might be to place the Administration of the Basra Vilayet under a &quot; Governor &quot; or &quot;Deputy-Governor&quot; of Basra, subordinate to a &quot;High Commissioner,&quot; with headquarters at Bagdad, whose authority would extend to the whole of Mesopotamia.But in the more likely event of the Basra Vilayet becoming British territory, there appear strong objections to such a solution. Apart from the anomaly of governing a British province (Basra.) from headquarters situated in territory with a less clearly defined status, it could not but seriously impair the Arab &quot; facade,&quot; which is to be the basis of our policy as regards Bagdad. For if Basra is annexed and the Head of the Administration for Basra and Bagdad enjoys the single title of &quot;High Commissioner for &quot;Mesopotamia,&quot; and has his official headquarters at Bagdad, it is difficult to imagine that any such &quot; facade &quot; can continue to exist or that the Arab mind will not consider the whole of Mesopotamia to have been annexed to Great Britain. The solution proposed would be for the Chief of the Administration to be termed &quot;Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Mesopotamia,&quot; with his titular headquarters at Basra; although it would be understood that he would usually reside at Bagdad, where his most important duties would lie. It would be necessary for two officials to be available, one at Basra and one at Bagdad, to assist him and to replace him during absence. These officials might be called &quot;Deputy Governor of Basra &quot; and &quot; Deputy High Commissioner for Mesopotamia,&quot; respectively.&apos;.). Civil Service: We see objection to the creation of a special British Civil Service for Mesopotamia, on the ground that the cadre would be too small to be self-supporting, and that the number of prize appointments would be insufficient to attract candidates of the best stamp. We would recommend the amalgamation of the Service with that of the Sudan and possibly that of the Levant also, recruitment to these services being by the same method and the personnel interchangeable. In the early stages it will probably be necessary to-empkyy a number of military officers in various civil capacities. British Officers from the Indian or Levant Services are also likely to be required for some time, though it is difficult to estimate, even approximately, in what numbers. Such officers can be lent temporarily under the &quot; Foreign Service &quot; rules already in force. Opportunity should also be given to British officers of Indian Services, civil and military&apos;, now employed in Mesopotamia to volunteer for per-manent transfer to the new Service.1.0. That Arabistan being a Persian Province, the Sheikh of Mohammera being a Persian subject; and the Karun river being an artery that flows entirely through Persian territory, it seems desirable that they should remain under the same form of political influence as Avill exist in the remainder of Southern Persia.11. That, under the revision of the Anglo-Russian Agreement about Persia that will be inevitable when the war is over, this influence will necessarily he a British influence, and will naturally be exercised by the Indian Government,12.: That the British sphere of influence, as exercised by the Indian Government, should include the Bakhtiari country, and the regions hitherto
included in the neutral zone, i.e., the regions south of Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman. It will, therefore, be contiguous with the existing Russian sphere.13. That the British Consuls or officers in this region, i.c, at any or all of the following places, Mohammera, Ahwaz, Dizful, Sinister, Shiraz, Bushirc, Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Kerman, &amp;c, should be nominated by the Indian Government, although in the cases of Shiraz and Kerman they would require to report also to the British Minister at Teheran.14. West and South Coast of Persian Gulf and Muscat. Certain aspects of tho question appear to us to point to the desirability of placing the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf and Muscat under the political control of the Mesopotamian authorities rather than of the Government of India. The acquisition by Bin Sand of El liasa will necessarily bring under the control of the former the Arabian coast as far south as Bahrein. We understand, moreover, that the Govern-ment of India already experience considerable difficulty, in staffing the posts in this region, owing to the- limited number and value of the appointments available, which offer little inducement to officers of the Indian Political Department to qualify themselves for service .in Arabic-speaking districts. This difficulty will be greatly increased by the removal of Bagdad from the Indian sphere. We recommend that the Government of India should be consulted on this point with as little delay as possible, and that, in the absence of strong objection on their part, the question should be reconsidered in the light of the above remarks.15. Aden- and South Coast of Arabia. We consider that the present opportunity should be taken to gratify the long-expressed desire of the Government of India to be relieved of the charge of Aden and its depen-dencies. The political control of the Hadramaut and the South Arabian Coast (as also of the island of Socotra) should, in our opinion, go with that of Aden. The Administration which should be asked to take them over for the present should be the Foreign Office.16. That it is not desirable at present to contemplate any disturbance of the Cairo sphere of influence, which &quot;should include Western Arabia (Hejaz, A sir and Yemen).II. Speaking generally, we are of opinion that the administrative arrange-ments introduced during the present military occupation into Mesopotamia as a whole should be consistent with the future policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Basra Vilayet, if it is decided to administer it as British territory through the direct agency of British officials, will cause no special -difficulty. The international position to be assigned to the Bagdad Vilayet will require careful consideration, and we have not examined in detail the possible alternative solutions of the problem. But, on the. information before us we are disposed to recommend that the existence of the Bagdad State be recognised under a local ruler or local Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, assuming full responsibility for its external relations. The manner in which the internal sovereignty would be shared would be a matter of municipal arrangement.We are disposed to think that it would be possible to provide a satisfactory administration, suitable to the requirements of the people, on the general lines of the system prevailing in Egypt, under which local administrative work is carried on by native Mudirs under the guidance of European &quot;Inspectors.&quot; The various reform schemes proposed in the past for the administration of Turkish provinces such as Macedonia and Armenia might also serve as a convenient model.III. We have not considered the question of the military defence of Mesopotamia, or of the quarter from which the troops for this purpose are to be provided.IV. We would emphasise the importance of an early decision oh the points raised above. Any necessary reference to the Government of India or elsewhere should, in our opinion, be made by telegraph with the least possible delay.
