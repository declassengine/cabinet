SECRET.P.     Operations.CLEAR THE. LIKE. From :- G.O.C.-in-C., Salonica, to C.I,,O.S.     17/4/17.G.C. 948.   Your 32931.I have been informed by Sarrail that postponement of attaok to April 25th was due in part to difficulties of the French caused by changes of plan owing to their failure t* advance after, capturing Kill 1248 north of Monastir, and in part to his hope that t^e Allied attack here, might, by this delay, synchronise with possible Russian offensive, of which he stated he possessed information; I cannot however  discover why this change of plan was regarded as advisable.I have no reason for stating that he had any ulterior motive underlying the delay,, and I am confident that he now really intends to attack,  as he has definitely ordered my attack to take place on April 24th, the antidate of one day being caused by obligatory telegram received by him from Painleve on April 15th, which quickened up French arrangements. The rest of the Allied foroes here are to attack a day or two later, by which time Grossetti states he will be ready.
