Report of a Sub-Committee of the War TradeAdvisory Committee.III. Memorandum in explanation of II.iiLetter from 3ir E, Eopwood to Sir M..: H^^ev^April 10th,. 1917,My dear Eankey&quot;With reference to my interview with you on ;   April End, I think it would he well to recapitulate tbe -ooints we then discussed on the question of the re-organisation of the ITar Trado Advisory Committee.Effect of appointment of Ministry of Blockade CommitteeThe. practicaleffect of theappointmentOjLthe Ministry of Blockade Committee early in 1917 has been to remove from the War Trade Advisory Committee a proportion of the Questions - particularly thoserelating to Blockade administration - which ordinarily were presented for&quot;consideration to the War Trade Advisory Committee.The latter Committee since its inception in September 191.5 was called upon to consider a greatrange of subjects, some of which of necessity were con-cerned with the interests of Departments otherthanWork of the War Trade Advi-sory Commit- those immediately responsible for the Blockade.   This tee and in-terpretation of terms ofreference,     tho United Kingdom on&apos;foreign supplios of materialsfact rendered a too narrow interpretation of the terms of reference undesirable.   In consequence it will bo noted that subjects such as the dependence ofnecossary for the war; supplies and stocks of oleaginous nroduce, the possibility of a scheme for rendering the United Kingdom independent of foreign supplies of margarine, were considered, although not&apos; within the strict scope of the Committee^ functions. Later developments have clearly shown that the policy of the restriction of exports is dependent upon tho conservation of homo supplies quite as much, if not&quot; more, than upon the restriction of enemy1s supplies. Moreover at the present stage the Departments responsible for war measures find it necessary, without in any way trenehing upon the work of the
Question &quot;of ti-,e purchase 0f Italian5il&amp;Reconstruction Committee, to view such measures in the light of post-war conditions.During my absence in Scandinavia on actual instance occurred when the assistance of the Committee was inverted to -consider the question of the purchase - of ^Italian Silk and the home supplies of silk for war and-industrial purposes.   Lord Lmmott as Deputy Chairman of the bar Trade Advisory Committee, appointed an-Interdepartmental Committee to consider these&quot; matters and the Committee reported in due:course to the main Committee,Interests involved.Conflict of interests.ThisSilk is, IQuestionthink,whichquestion of the purchase of.Italiana good example -of the type -of is likely to arise.-Many interests - military, financial, indus-;ell as 1 blockade1 - were involved.,stho. -subject illustrated the possibility o:tr ial, siiipping, lloroovor; the su..conflict, oh problems of supplies and trade, between Departments, and the need of an advisory body which would bo in a position to advise on the conflicting-issues as a preliminary.to decision by the 7ar Cabinet or the Departments concerned, and to obviate lengthy int er dopar tmental c orr o sp ondonce,Proposed constitution of the Com-Eiittee,the constitution n amendment - ofI must add a few words as to of the Committee on the assumption.of its terms of reference.     As to.the main Committee itself it would seem better to retain the system of Departmental representation extending, this to other Departments and to tho Reconstruction Committee.   T/ith a.view to increased efficiency and to avoid the necessity of summoning, the &quot;whole Committee on every question for consideration, it is suggested that a General Purposes Committee of not more than seven members should&quot;bo nominated by me as Chairman of themain Committee, to whic detailed work of authority to actshould be delegated thetheCommittee with a general in matters of urgency or betweenthe dates o:oneordinary meetings of the main Com-mittee.   It would appear to be necessary that a representative of the Reconstruction Committee&quot;should be a member of this General Purposes Committee, and further, that Its nomination should depend more uwon personal grounds than/upon an adherence to the prin-ciple of Departmental representation.   It has been suggested that Mr, Stoel-Kaitland would be a very suitable Chairman of the General l?urnoses Committee,

II.     Report of a Sub-Committee of the War Trade -- , .&apos; .. Advisory &quot;ftommittee. 7&quot;;     1as amended at the 66th Meeting of the Committee (29th March 1917)WAR TRADE ADVISORY COMMITTEE.REPORT of the Sub-Committee appointed to consider the. constitution and functions of the War Trade.Advisory Committee.Members-Lord Emmott. (Chairman) Vice-Admiral Sir EySlade Brig.General G.K-Cockerill Mr ,C.J:.,B.Burst Mr. A, D. Steel Malt land, M.P. Mr .D\0.Malcolm-Mr .H.W.C-, Davis Mr.J.R.MurrayMr.E.H,Tindal Atkinson. (Secretary)The Sub-Committee was appointed by resolution of the Grand Committee passed at the 65th.Meeting (February 28th 1917). In considering the questions raised at that meeting the Sub-Committee have thought that it would be. convenient to divide their report into three main heads, viz:&apos;(1)   the type of questions likely to.be assigned to the Committee, on the assumption that its. terms of. reference are to be enlarged?(2)    the amendment of the constitution of the Committee;(3)    the terms of reference which would be necessary to enable the Committee to render assistance to the War Cabinet and the Departments in considering and advising upon.interdepart-mental questions.Questions to be assigned to the Committee.1. The War Trade Advisory Committee was formed under aTreasury Minute of the 20th September, 1915, Lord Crewe being appointed Chairman by .the Prime Minister, and its terms of reference were as follows.:-&quot;&quot;to advise on the restriction:of enemies5 supplies to co-ordinate the administration.of the War Trade Department, the Contraband Committee, the Res-triction of Enemy5s Supplies Committee, and the Committees for controlling the export: of coal, cotton, rubber and tin, and to advise- the Cabinet on questions of policy arising therefrom&apos;!The principal subjects-of Its deliberations were questions relevant to the Restriction of Enemy Supplies, but, as will be shown later, they have not been entirely, limited&apos;to such questions.    .-Some months later, Lord RobertCecil was appointed Minister in Charge of Blockadeand
i -   13so became directly responsible for some of the matters on which the Committee was directed to advise.     Lord Cre?.re who had been the link between the Cabinet and the Committee hp to that time., consequently retired from the Committee, Sir Francis Hopwood being appointed Chairman in his place. Early in January 1917 Lord Robert Cecil appointed the Ministry of Blockade Committee, the permanent nucleus of which is the Right Hon. FvLeverton Harris, M.P-. and repres-entatlves of three of our Allies;:    The creation of that. Committee has removed from the bar Trade Advisory Committee the greater number of the questions which would otherwise have been considered by it :?.nd if its terms of reference are -strictly interpreted there remain few questions other than those dealt with by. the Ministry of Blockade Committee which can be referred to it.On the other hand, the terms of reference of the V.&apos;ar Trade Advisory Committee have not been interpreted in any narrow sense by either Lord Crewe or Sir Francis Hopwood. The existence of other questions of importance to which no other organisation representative of the various Departments could give its attention, necessitated the consideration by the Committee on more than one occasion of matters which appeared to travel beyond its terms of reference, and has involved the appointment by the Committee of interdepartmental committees to consider matters connected with home supplies.. .As an instance of this tendency, the Standing Sub-rCommittee on Oils and Seeds may be mentioned, the principal duty of this Sub-Committee being to watch the stocks of such commcdit-ies in the United Kingdom and to make enquiries or recommenda-tiens in regard to the future supply of any of them.   Another instance is a Committee which wa&quot;s appointed to consider the question of how the supply of margarine produced in the   -United Kingdom can be increased in order to relieve us of our dependence upon Holland..     The real point to be considered is whether there is not still a need for such an organisation as the War Trade Advisory Committee to prepare reports onproblems connected with commodities andAtrade as affected by the War which are outside the purely Blockade msttors now dealt with by the Ministry of Blockade Committee.The fact of the existence of such problems as are mentioned above with which the ear Trade Advisory Committee have been compelled to deal, is rendered more serious by the following considerations.     The increasing importance of home supplies as a factor in decisions as to the restriction of exports, the necessity of regarding present war trade measures in the light of post-war policy, and the new problems arising from the exercise of the powers of Departments such as the Ministries of Food, National Service,  Shipping and Labour, are all likely to raise interdepartmental questions, the con-sideration of which can, it is submitted, be usefully under-taken by the Committee, and which, so far as we are aware, there is no other interdepartmental body in existence to consider.
4, The nature of the questions which might heassigned to the.Committee is best illustrated by a concrete instance..    At theory time of - the appointment of the Sub-Committee &quot;the War Office were anxious   to secure the consideration by an&apos;interdepart lental Committee of the question of the purchase of Italian Silk,     This matter, arose primarily in connection with the advisability of purchasing Italian Silk for -military purposes.     The Director of Army Contracts, while finding that, by reason of the possibility of using .certain substitutes, &apos;such a purchase was not&apos;absolutely essential ffom the purely/military point of view, considered that it might be highly desirable on general grounds in.view of the many other interests involved, notably those of the Foreign.  Office,;the&apos; -Blockade Departments and,.from the British manufacturers1 point of view,.of.the Board of&apos;Trade.    A decision to purchase would-concern, the ^interests, of yet other Departments such as the Treasury, on the financial-   side, and of the Director of National Service, as.regards the necessity of transfer of labour for&apos; home manufacture, or of limiting the amount of labour to be employed&apos; for manufacturing for hx-mie consumption.5* Many questions arise between lepartments controllingexports and imports of important commodities., where a more complete interchange of views is desirable on matters of policy.     There remain also wider questions relating to the conduct of the blockade which concern Departments other than those represented upon the Ministry of Blockade Committee and problems of supplies and trade in which the increasing importance of viewing war impLle measures in the light of post-war conditions is apparent.- In&quot;these cir-cumstanceo the Sub-Committee have come to the conclusion that questions do exist and will arise in which the --.    :tt. Committee may render useful service.(2) Amendment of the constitution of the Committee:1. The -Sub-Committee have considered the amendment ofthe constitution of the Committee from two main points of view:- Representation. 8.nd. ( 2) Organisation.    On thequestion of representation the Sub-Committee have come to the definite conclusion that the present system should be retained, by which each Department interested in matters assigned to the Committee may be represented by one or more members,.&apos;     The Sub-Committee have considered a possible reduction in the &quot;number of members of the Committee which could be effected by each Department being represented by one member only but have come to the con-elusion that, subject to their -recommendations as to organisation of the work of the Committee,  such a reduction is inadvisable.2. Assuming an enlargement of the terms :of reference tothe Committee and that the Committee will have to udder-take the consideration of matters of the kind referred to in the first part of this Report, the Sub-Committee recommend that, in addition to the Departments at present represented, tho following Departments, and Committees should also be represented:-    The Ministries of Food
Shipping and Labour,-the Departments of the Procurator. General, and of the Director of National Service, the. Reoonstxuetions Committee and-the-Commission Internation-ale de RavitaillementAs questions involving finance and and- exchange may he brought forward,  it would be uselul if the Treasury were also represented.3, On the subject:, of the&apos; organisation of the worEaofthe Committee,- it has &quot;seemed apparent to the Gub-Committee that considerable reform is advisable-     It has&apos; been the rule in the past to summon the whole Committee for the purpose of considering or referring to a&apos; Sub-Committee questions -which in some instances may concern only a /small proportion of the Departments represented and delay has occurred by the need to obtain the,.consent of the. Committee to the appointment of Sub-Committees, to deal with matters of detail or problems in which expert . information was required as a preliminary to consideration by the Committee itself.    Difficulties of this kind would be more serious ,in the case of the more varied-questions which&apos;might be referred to the Committee under extended terms of reference,&apos;  The Sub-Committee have therefore- come-to the conclusion that the effieiendy of. the 6ommittee would be much increased by the creation of a General Purposes Committee of the Committee itself.4. If this suggestion meets with approval, the General; Purposes Committee, should be possessed of wide powers of- action, including a general authority to act. in matters . :of urgency 01 between the dates -on which the Committee-would-ordinarily meet.&apos;    When it becomes necessary to . appoint a Sub-Committee., the appointment could be made- by the General Purposes Committee or by its Chairman. . It has seemed to the Sub-Committee that a GeneralPurposes Committee of this nature, should..in the interests of efficiency, be limited to a few members nominated by- -the Chairman of the full Committee.   While offering this :--*^suggestion as to the numbers of the General Purposes /Committee and the mode in which it should he formed, theSub--Committee would prefer to lay stress, rather, on the -desirability in principle of forming such a Committee- than on the actual mode of its formatic; .-,- -The -existence of a General, Purposes Committee with powers delegated to - it would relie-e the Committee cf
,.a considerable amount of its work and except in-nzrgent 01 important cases, in which it would he ne-oes-sary to summon the whole Committee, it is prebable that monthly meetings of the Committee-would he sufficient for the transaction of their ordinary business.     In the majority of cases; including those in which consideration by a Sub-Committee is found necessary, the General Purposes Committee would aot for the Committee in submitting recommendations to the War Cabinet or to the Departments as the case may be.). Except as to their method of appointment the Sub-Committee recommend that the present system of Sub-Committees should be continued but they desire to emphasise the importance of ensuring the attendance at Sub-Committees, as the representatives .of the Departments concerned, of the particular officials who have the con-duct of the question under consideration, and the advisability of obtaining the help, whether as witnesses before Sub-Committees or as members of them, of persons, whether in -official positions or not, able to give expert advice or information.Terms of Eeference:It appears to the Sub-Committee that, in order to enable the Committee to undertake the consideration of questions of the kind referred to in Part (l) of this Report, the present terms of reference to the Committee must of necessity be amended and enlarged.     To avoid the possibility of the Cemmittee&apos;s work overlapping that ef any other Committee, particularly the Reconstruction Committee, the amended terms of reference require careful definition.     At the same time the importance of allowing the Committee to take into consideration post-war con-ditions in relation to present war trade policy requires -that the terms shall not be too narrowly limited..&apos;:   The Sub-Committee are of opinion that &quot;Trade and Supplies&quot; fairly mark the necessary limit to the question which the War Cabinet or the Departments are likely to refer to the Committee, It is understood that questions relatingexclusively to the Blockade will not fall within its province, unless referred to it by the Minister of Blockade,     The Sub-Committee therefore present for con-sideration the fol.&apos;.owing draft terms:-&quot;To consider and advise the War Cabinet upon anyt interdepartmental questions, relating to supplies and trade as affected by the War, which the War Cabinet or a Government Department may refer to it.&quot;
Ill, &apos;MQMg IN B2iPIA33/lTIOH W II,1.   Tho above report was considorod and with one amendment was accepted by the Committee at their 66th Meeting held on March 29th, 1917. .   The emcndrnont related to the esclnsion from tho proposed terms of reference of the y/ords ^Questions relating exclusively to the Blockade y/111 not fall within its province&quot; .     It was.pointed out that these words introduced an unnecessary limitation of the powers of the Committee in that, although tho Ministry of Blockade Committee deals with matters of every day administration of the Blockade, questions may well arise which tho Minister of Blockade as head of a Government Department may desire to. refer to the - Committee.     Tho Committee agreed that those words should be included in the body of the report itself as illustrating the respectivo spheres of duty of the two Committees,2,   Some discussion arose as to the position of tho Sub-Committee which deals with additions to the Contraband List, and it was suggestod that this Sub-Committee might be re-constitutcd bo that it should be controlled by and report to the Ministry of Blockade Committee.     This Sub-Committee was appointed towards the -end of 1915 by the Wax Trade Advisory Committee and it was then agreed that the following Departments&quot;should be represented thereon, -namely the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office, Board of TradOj Ministry of Munitions, War Trade Department, and the Contraband Committee.     Since its appointment this Sub-Committee has met at regular intervals to consider and report upon additions to the contraband list and on some occasions upon additions to or amendments in tho lists of prohibited exports-.     The War ,0ffice, the Board of Trade, and the Ministry of Munitions are not   represented on the Ministry of Blockade Committoe and moreover additions to the contraband list at times involve interdepartmental considerations Which axe outside the mere administration of the Blockade with which tho Blockade Committee is con-cerncd.     It is true that the Contraband list is a matter which is intimately connected with the. policy and ?/orking of the; jui.Blockade,&apos;but the foregoirjg consideration led the Committee to the&apos;conclusion-that it is undesirable to make any change in the constitution of the Contraband List Sub-Committee and &quot;that the system should bo continued whereby its reports are presented to the Foreign Office after consideration and confirmation by the War Trade Advisory Committee.3,   In paragraph 2 of the second part of the report of the Sub-Committee, which deals v?ith the possible increase in the number of departmental representatives, a recommenda-tion is made that among other departments, the   Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement should be represented.&apos;on the Committee.     It was pointed cut,that the Committee, if reconstituted, would in many instances, deal with domestic matters in which the assistance of the Allied Governments and communication with them would bo unnecessary.     It was felt that.:, some; difficulty may arise on. this account if the dis-tribution of papers entails, the consultation of his foreign colleagues by the   representative; of the Commission, ..&apos; The Committee agreed that, instead of .the Commissi on being re-quested to nominate -a representative in the ordniary course, -the Jrimo Minister should be moved to nominate one of the Britisli delegates on the   Commission to attend the Committee In the capacity if assessor in matters in which the interests or duties ef the Commission come into question.
4,   In that pert of the report which deals with the organisation of the work of tho Committee the most important recommendation Is that which concerns tho appoint-ment cf a General   rurposes Committeea     It appears, to the Committee that the duties of the General Purposes Committee may entail the devotion of a considerable  count cf time to its work by its members, and that this fact should be borne In mind in considering its selection.     The Committee came to a definite conclusion that. In selecting the members of the General Purposes Committee It would be better not- to proceed ion any principle of departmental representation and consequently that it would not be necessary to lay down any rule to the effect that this Committee should bo selected only from .the members of the Grand Committee0   . At tho same time,  it was thought   necessary that anv persons appointed to the General Purposes Committee&apos;should.ipso facto be nominated members of the Grand Committee *     In so far as tho Committee, if reconstituted, may find it necessary.to consider pest war conditions as affecting tho solution of problems of war trade or home supplies, it appeared to the Committee desirable that a representative of the Reconstruction Committee should be nominated as a member of this General Purposes Committee.30th March, 1917
