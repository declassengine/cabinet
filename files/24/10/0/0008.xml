AMERICAN REPRESENTATION AT ALLIED CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN PARIS IN SECOND WEEK IN MAY

It is thought that the following Press Cable, which has been suppressed by the Press Bureau, may interest Members of the War Cabinet. I have suggested to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that he should make a representation to the Government of the U.S.A., representing the danger involved in publicity in regard to journeys such as that referred to.
