Copy.No. 68.Secret.W.    9FOREIGN OFFICE.April 5th, 1917.Sir,The Italian Government have, as you are doubt less^-aware, recently made various applications for support in view of the possibility of a heavy hostile attack On the Italian front-.His Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to these- requests and I enclose a memorandum on the subject which contains their consider*ccl views.I shall be glad if Your Excellency will address an immediate communication to the Italian Government in the sense of the memorandum in whatever form you consider most advisable.I am,&apos;with great truth and respect,Sir,Your Excellency1s most obodicnt, -humble Servant,-s ExcellencyThe Right Honourable/Sir R. Rodd, G.C.M.G. , G.C/V&quot;.Q., &amp;c.,     &amp;c.,     Sec., /
His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered the question of.the probability of a heavy attack being made on the Italian front, and the provision of assistance to the Italian Army from the Western front. They have had- the advantage , cf conferring with. General Sir v&apos;Illiam Robertson on his return from his visit to ; the Italian front and of hearing his views and impressions of that visit.Sir William Robertson has informed the War Cabinet- of the very high opinion he has formed of General Cadorna1c grasp - of the military situation, and of his fitness for the responsible position which he&apos;has the honour to hold.   He has also reported, that he&quot;was much impressed by the physique, bearing and spirit cf the Italian troops, and of the skill.displayed by them in overcoming the difficulties of the mountainous theatre of war in which they are operating,..   As a consequence of this report, and in view of the great- superiority in numbers of the Italian infantry over that of the enemy on their front, as well as the considerable superiority in artillery which the Italian Army, po His .Majesty&apos;s Government hope,, If no.heavy concentration is made by the enemy against the Italian front, that the Italian forces will be vigorously used In offensive action as soon as possible so as&apos; tc ensure that co-operation of effort with the British and French Armies already agreed upon.    Simultaneous&apos;    offensive action by the three armies&quot;is of special importance because of the present situation&apos;in Russia.\-ith
With regard to the possibility of the enemy concentrating largo forces for an attack upon Italy, as soon as the climate and other conditions permit, His Majesty!s Government are&apos;not. aware that.there, is at present any definite indication of this concentration being made,- and they hope- that the enemy will be prevent-ed from making it by the Allied operations on others fronts..   . Should this, however, not prove to.be the case., His Majesty5s Government, see every reason to expect, in view of the strength and efficiency of the Italian troops, thsb  the.latter will be able to meet any attack which the  -nemy is likely to bring against them.    It may also be noted that the enemy divisions are both weaker, and much less efficient now. than.they.were during the -first year of the.war.At the same time His Majesty?s Government tocog-nise that it is necessary to provide for the possibility, however remote, of reinforcements from the British Armies in France being required on the Italian front, and accordingly, they are prepared, if the Italian Government agrees, to despatch some Staff Officers at once to get Into- touch with the Italian General Staff and to-work out In detail the arrangements for the employment cf any. British troops which may eventually be sent, . They think it right to add that the possibility of sending reinforce ments must naturally be governed by the situation at the time.His Majesty&apos;s Government learn, from the inform-aticn supplied them by Sir William Robertson, that although,, as already stated, the Italian Army-has on Its front a larger number.of guns than the enemy opposed to it possesses, yet the amount of artillery at Its disposal
does not enable it to take full advantage of. Its great superiority in infantry..       It appears to-thorn that the Italian Army particularly requires for this purpose an increased number of field guns and of medium howitzers, and thoy suggest that the Italian Government should approach the French Government with a view to obtaining some French field artillery, which, as the Italian Government is doubt-less aware, is second to none,   They themselves are prepared to lend,, if the Italian Government agrees, ten, batteries, furnished with the necessary personnel and an adequate provision of ammunition, of their most modern 6- inch howitzers - a weapon which has proved its value upon the&apos;front in Franco,     In ordor that those batteries may reach the Italian front by tho time ??hon operations on a large scale becomepossible, it is important that His Majesty1s Government should have very early intimation as to whether this offer is agrocable to the Italian Govern-ment.      The batteries can be despatched during the second and third weeks of April. &apos;From tho information supplied by Sir. William - Robert san, it appears that the regulations for the promo.-tion of officers in the Italian Army aro such as to mako tho- advancement of young and energetic commanders difficult, If not Impossible., and he has expressed the fear that some of the Italian Army and Army Oorpc Commanders aro too old to be ablo to endure the great fatigue&apos; of a protracted war in so difficult a terrain as that in which the Italian Army is operating., and personally, to supervise tho oporations of their commands with that energy which Is required by the exacting conditions of modern warfare.   His Majesty1s Government wish to represent to the Italian Government, that both thoir own experience of this war^ and&apos;that of the French and RussianArmies,
Armies, has proved the absolute necessity of having young and energetic officers in command, and that in all these Armies stops have been taken to change the ordinary routine of peace time and to select officers, regardless (if their seniority, who arc fully qualified, physically as well ac mentally, to carry out those vitally important and onerous duties which at prosent devolve upon all Commandersi     His Majesty1s Government invito the earnest attention of&apos;the Italian Government to this questions &apos;
