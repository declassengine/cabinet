.T.476.WAR CABIMI.AIR BOARD17th April 1917Sir,I am directed by the President of the Air Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant forwarding copy of a communication from Field-Marshall Sir Douglas Haig with reference to the Air Service,     This has been laid before the Air Board and I am to offer the following observations with regard to It for the information of the far Cabinet.Sir Douglas Haig states that &quot;the difficulties to be overcome were Increased by the number of out-of-date machines and new type macfa ines came too late for pilots to become accus-tomed to them&quot;,The Board believe the above statement to be substantially correct, except that while the new type machines sent out to Francs to be substituted in the equipment of Squadrons already there for machines of an older type no doubt reached France at a later late than was desirable for the purposes of the Offensive now in progress, the new Squadrons which proceeded from this country had been   adequately trained in the use of their machines before leaving for France,The problem of the production of new types of aircraft is one of such complexity that it can only be stated here in broad tin outline.The root difficulty to be overcome is that the production of engines of the increased power required by the constant developments, of aviation. It cannot betoo ******The Secretary to the War CabinetS Whitehall Gardens, S.W, 1,
too clearly appreciated, for the purpose of understanding the present situation, that with the exception of the Rolls-Royce engine, and in a lesser degree of the Beardmore engine, it is only to-day that we are reaching the stage of the production in substantial quantities of an engine, suitable for Fighter and Fighter-Reconnaissance aeroplanes, of British design and manufacture.      Apart from these two engines, of which more will be siad below, the Royal Flying Cfcrps have hitherto been dependant for the class of aircraft in question upon French engines.      As regards these, although the French Government have given great assistance and large contracts have been placed! in France, the supplies for this country have necessarily been sub-ordinated to some extent to the requirements of the French Government.      As a result, the numbers available for British aircraft have been far smaller than could be desired, while the trials necessary for adapting new designs of aeroplanes to them have met with difficulties and delays which would not have occured had the engines been of British origin.Reference has been made above to the Rolls-Royce and Beardmore engines.     The former is a very efficient engine. Technical considerations, however, and the peculiar character--isties of the proprietary firm have hitherto presented! in-surmountable difficulties&apos; to fts productions In the numbers required.      Owing moreover, to the system by which engines were, until recently, manufactured separately for Naval and Military aircraft, only a proportion of these engines was, by the favour of the Admiralty, allotted to the Royal Flying Corps.     This proportions though generously increased &quot;by the Admiralty was small in relation to the requirements of the R.F.C. in the field.
The Beardmore engine has only recently been developed to a power (160 h.p.) which renders its performance adequate to the requirements of the pre-sent day.   This development has been accompanied by difficulties of a technical character which again have hitherto limited its output.As a result of these causes, supplemented by the diffi.ou.lty of obtaining adequate supplies of &apos; raw material and labour under the regime then in force, the development of aircraft during last Summer and Autumn,  suited to meet the needs of the present cam-paign, was retarded, and the forecast given to General Trenchard last September has, as stated in the letter of the 24th February, i917, from the Secretary to the War Office to the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief (of which a copy was enclosed in my letter to you Of the 1st March), been delayed about one month.   It should be, borne in mind in this con-neotion that an interval of many months must elapse between the time when the requirements which a new type of aeroplane has to fulfil are specified and the moment when that type reaches the manufacturing stage.The Air Board in its re-organised form was appointed at the beginning of this year and has gradually been .taking over the functions hitherto exercised by the Aeronautical Supply Departments of the Admiralty and War Office.   I am to state that Mr, Percy Martin and Sir William Weir, the new Con-trollers of Petrol Engines and Aeronautical Supplies,
report that, on taking over their new duties, they found that the Directorate of Aircraft Equipment, which was previously charged with the duty of furnishing air-craft to the Royal Plying Corps, had, in the fact of great difficulties, worked with extreme energy and that, having regard to the conditions prevailing, the results achieved are extremely good.     It should he realised, however, how unfavourable those conditions have been. The President is informed by Sir David Henderson that he lost no opportunity of impressing upon the Govern-ment in the early part of last year that the system by which the Admiralty and the War Office were severally!responsible for the supply of the material to the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps was detri-mental to the public interest, inasmuch as it provided no means of applying the resources of the country in the proportion of tne real requirements of the two Services.    The Government recognised the force of his contentions by appointing the Joint War Air Committee under the Chairmanship of lord Derby, but neither this nor the Air Board under the Presidency of Lord Curzon which succeeded it, had the powers necessary to organise the supply of aircraft on a common basis, nor to secure the necessary degree of priority for the Flying Service as regards raw material and labour.These conditions prevailing prevailed during the crucial months of last Summer when the situation, of which complaint is now made had its real genesis.Although the considerations in regard to engine supply which have been set forth above could no doubt not have been altogether overcome by.any change
of organisation, yet the experience of the Air Board,since its re-constitution last January, tends to showthat a substantial improvement might have been broughtabout had the problem of supply been dealt with earlier,and the requisite degree of priority secured forAeronautical Supplies.The following figures shewing the ratio ofpast deliveries of engines to present and guaranteedfuture deliveries are eloquent in this respect :-If the average monthly deliveries of engines for 1916 be taken as a standard figure of 8then the average actual deliveriesfor January and February 1917would be represented by 16the guaranteed deliveries for theperiod 1st March to 30th June,1917, by 19and the guaranteed deliveries forthe period 1st July to 31stOctober, 1917, by the figure 29.It is only right to add that the way for the improvement now in prospect was in a large measure pre-pared by the untiring efforts of the Directorate of Aircraft Equipment, which has now ceased to exist.There can thus be no question but that the supply of aircraft to the Expeditionary Force will steadily and materially improve during the remaining months of the year.    There have already been sent to the front since 1st January machines of new types amounting to an addition of seven squadrons, each involving provision of some 80 engines and, further, three and a half squad-rons already at the front have been equipped with new aeroplanes and engines.     This process will be continued as rapidly as the manufacturing and transport conditions now prevailing will permit.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servantj(Signed) H. P. Harvey.
