G.T.441 THE SUPPLY Of KSLIGaL SERVICES&apos;for the civil population and the army.-** ItEmORAlTBUk ** for England and wales as to(a)Action taxen hy the National liealth Insurance Commissions with reference to release of Insurance medical practitioners for service in the 11aYy orArmyj&apos; and(.b)-Pre sent -2nd prospective adequacy of the Insurance medical service in view of military requirements.1. On the outbreak of war, the Insurance Commissionerstook steps to secure,with the co-operation of Insurance Committees,that no unnecessary obstacle should be placed in the way of practitioners who were engaged in the insur-ance medical service joining the Army (or Havy) where they could properly be spared from their civil duties.   They accordingly felt justified in taking action which.enabled a practitionerJs name&apos;to remain on the panel list during the whole time that he wa3 absent in military service, those who were in fact discharging his duties being recog-nised a.3 his deputies;    and also in amending the Regulations with a view to securing to an absent insurance praetit-m ioner.the-goodwill of. his insurance practice, so far as was consistent-with due regard for the interests oik insured persons.. &apos; - -2. The Commissioners were oat the ssme time alive to thenecessity of maintaining an adequate insurance medical service in every area.   The measure3..above described, while facilitating the undertaking of, military aedical service by insurance practitioners by reducing the financial sacrifice which such acceptance entailed upon them, at. the s^me time reserved to the COaimissioners and the Insurance Committee a measure of control over the position,since the protection of the doctor&apos;s pecuniary interests was .con-tingent upon their being satisfied with the arrangements made for carrying on his Woric in hi3 absence.3.&apos; During the firs^t yebr of. the war this controlafforded a sufficient Safeguard against undue depletion of the insurance medical Service throughout the country as a whole; and no serious difficulties arose except through circumstances that would in any event have been beyond the control of the Commission:    The position was, however, carefully watched; and, in the early autumn of 1915, it became apparent that tendencies were at work which If not che c ke d mi ght h?. ve s e rious result s.
Owing to the increasing need of the Army for doctors, the Director-General of the Army Medical Service had found it necessary to take special steps to stimulate offers of service.     The tas&amp; of obtaining such offers-, selecting for the purpose those doctors who could under-take service with the least hardship to the, selves and least disadvantage to the Civil&apos; community was entrusted by his to a professional body known as the Central kedical war Committee-, which was appointed by the British Medical Association at the end of July.1915-,   This Committee worked with the co-operation of Local Medical War Committees elected by the profession in every part of England and Wales.     The duty of these Local Committees was to induce those doctors who cc-uld, in their view, most suitably accept commissions, to offer their services.     Each-Committee was asked to obtain offers of service from a specified number of doctors,&apos; the number for each area being fined.; by the Central Committee with reference to the total number of doctors in the area of that. Committee, without taking account of the population to. be served or the character&apos; of. the district, leaving&apos;these points to the judgment of the.Local Committees,&apos;The basis of recruiting being a that time entirely voluntary, and the task of selection, apart from spontaneous offers., be entirely in the hands of professional bodies, the tendency naturally was for selection to take account of the personal circumstances of doctors rather than of the : needs of the community.     As a result, there was ,a, danger that Insurance practitioners might be selected i&amp; greater  . proportion than others, since the practitioner engaged only in private practice had not the same security for retaining hi3 practice as was afforded to tjhe- insurance practitioner, by the Commissioners1 action described in paragraph 1. There was al30 a danger, for similar, reasons, that rural areas and industrial districts would be drawn upon to a dispropor-tionatc extent- in&apos; comparison with residential neighbourhoods.Vlth a view to guarding against any consequent excess of depletion of,medical services for the industrial and;rural population, wftilc at the same time not putting any obstacle in the way of;the supply,of doctors needed by the army, the Commissioner&apos;^ entered into communication with both the Director-General&apos;of Army Medical Services and the Central Ledlcal \Yar Committee. -The Director-General readily consented to an arrahge-ment;under which a Commission would not be given to any insurance doctor for the conduct of whose work m his   -absence the insurance commission Were not satisfied that adequate arrangements would be made.
18. On the invitation of I&apos;ir, Charles Roberts, thenMinister for Health Insurance, the Central Medical War Committee conferred with him with reference to the whole position, on October 6th 1915.    The Committee recognised the necessity of adopting such a procedure In the selection of doctors1 for the- Army Ms would secure, as far as possible, the maintenance of an adequate Insurance Medical Service, and, generally, an adequate general practitioner servicefor the civil community, and several conferences ensued, between representatives of the English and  &apos;.&apos;elsh Commissions and the professional Committe--, as to the best methods to be adopted for deciding what doctors could best be spared from the service of the civil community.9. The following arrangements were eventually agreedupon&apos;-(a) That no further recruiting should be carried on for the time being in certain areas which appeared to be relatively depleted(b) That In deciding :;hat were the areas from which doctors could most readily be spared, and v.hat number could with safety be drawn at a particular time from a particular place, regard should be had not only to the number of doc-tors in each place, but also to the proportion of general practitioners to population in that place and to physical features of the country, facilities of locomotion and other factors affecting the ability of the remaining doctors in an area to carry on.the work of doctors who took Commiss-ione-(c) That the Army Council would not be recommended by the Central Medical &apos;:?ar Committee to grant a Commission to a practitioner on the panel unless the consent of the Com-missionsrs were-first obtained;(d) That there should be close co-operation between the Committee and the Commissioners In all the work of selection of practitioners to accept Commissions, and in particular!(1) That representatives of the English and -&apos;elsh Corn-missions should be invited to attend all meetings of the Central Hedical -^ar Committee and of its Executive Sub-Committee;(ll)That all Agenda, Minutes and other official documents of the Committee and Sub-Committee should be furnished to the Commissioners for their information at the same time as to members of the Committee Itself:
(111). That there should be all possible co-operation between the staff of the Committee and the staff of the Commission in matters in which they were mutually con-cerned.10. The co-operation between the Committee and the Com-missioners has not been confined to questions of selection of insurance practitioners for Commissions.    The Insurance medical service Includes quite three-fourths of the general practition-ers of the country, and ministers to the whole industrial community, including two-thirds of the adult male population. Thus,:&apos;the procedures necessary for estimating, and for pro-tecting, the adequacy of that service in a particular area have been found to be inextricably interwoven, and indeed largelv identical, with those necessary for measuring, and for protecting, the adequacy of the general practitioner service of the civil community as a whole.    The Committee have, there-fore, since the commencement of 1916, Increasingly shewn a disposition to avail themselves, in every department of their work, of such advice and assistance as the Commission were in a position to give;    and the Commission have felt justified- in placing the services of members of their staff very largely at the disposal of the Committee in the execution of their&quot; duties.    In particular, much of the statistical matter which, especially since the Military Service Acts came into operation has been indispensable for.the guidance of the Committee, has been compiled by the staff of the Commission.11. One of the chief results of this co-operation has beenthat the Commissioners have not found it necessary on any occasion to ask the Director General of Army Medical Service to refrain from calling up any doctor suggested for a Corn-mission by the professional Committee.    All cases of dif-,&apos;ficulty have been settled &apos; satisfactorily by discussion be-tween the Central radical lar Committee and the Commissioners. Moreover, the Commission have been able to secure, by re -presentations from time to time made to the Central Medical Far Committee, that the general principles of selection of doctots for military service should be such as would not press upon districts which were in greatest danger of depletion, or press unduly on &quot;the Uftsuranc-e medical service as, such. Selection has been carried out on a careful comparative basis, utilising all available evidence as to the relative needs of different carts of the country,&apos;and as to the number and capacity for work of the general practitioners available in each district.   &apos;Representatives of the Commission have taken an active part in the detailed procedure of assessment of the calls that could safely be made upon particular districts.12. As a result of.the care with which calls have been madea large number of doctors have been withdrawn for the Army from civil employment without any general or serious hardship to the civil Community.    In a fevi districts the supply, of doctors is dangerously small.     This, however, has not been due to action taken by the Central riedical &apos;&quot;ar Committee dur-ing the period In which the Commission have been co-operating with them, but usually to causes entirely beyond the control of either body,- e.g. volunteering of doctors for service in the earlier period of the war, voluntary migration of doctors
to other districts&apos;, failutte of health Or death of doctors, etc. In most places there remain, at the present moment, such a number of doctors as, if no further, demands by the Army were necessary, would suffice&quot; to. meet the needs of the community during the summer, and would also suffice   but in *-any - cases not: more than suffice*. during the winter.     There are many districts from which doctors Could be spared for military service during the period of the yeary. from May, say, to October,when the work of general practitioners is usually light, provided there were some definite assurance that the humber of doctors available in these districts could be restored to about Its present strength in the later autumn.13. The. difficulties in the way of release of doctors fromcivil work for military.service under existing conditions, arise chiefly from the combination of the following factors:-(a)inequality, in the distribution of doctors in propor-tion to population in different districts;(b)inequality in age distribution;(c)compulsion for military service applying only to doctors under 41;(d)absence of compulsion for civil employment.14. . Under peace conditions the distribution of doctorsis influenced quite as much by wealth as by population. The proportion to population varies greatly,    It is 1 doctor to 800 or 1,000 population in places like Hampstead, Kensington,Bournemouth or Harrogate, and one doctor to 5,000, tfiGO or 7,000 population in places like Bermondsey, Bethnal Green or St.Helens.     Moreover, as will perhaps naturally be expected, the average age of doctors in wealthy residential neighbourhoods and health resorts is considerably higher than.that, of doctors in industrial and ordinary rural districts. Hence, In the absence of any precautions to protect the civil population the withdrawal of younger doctors for military service would have deprived the industrial districts of the minimum necessary to provide essential services, while atill leaving the residential and similar districts with a redundant supply.     The precautions adopted to secure a supply for the civil population have prevented the industrial districts from being depleted^ but with the rS-sult that now the doctors under 41 and therefore subject to compulsion for military service are working almost entirely in districts.from, which they cannot be spared, whilst in towns and districts of another type there are more doctors than are required, but none of them under 41 and fit for military service.
15.      &apos;    Of the doctors in districts in which there Is asuperfluity, some, being between 41 and 45, could be utilised by the Army for foreign service, but cannot be compelled to serve.    Trose between-the ages of 45 and 55 could be employed by the Army to a-certain- extent for home service * but cannot, be got to do this tork.   . Again-, many of the doctors over 41, -if they could be&apos;got for the purpose, could be employed to -undertake civil work in districts from .which, doctors&quot;cannot at -present be spared, and. thus release doctors under 41, fit for-military service, who at. present have to be retained for the -needs of the civil community ir,&apos;those-areas. &apos;Under existing conditions there is no means oi bringing &apos; about the* substitutions and other adjustments necessary to &apos;   reinedv these inequalities.   The Commissioners, - there tore, are ccnvi^c-d that, as ratters,stand at present, further demands DSnSe Irmylor doctors cannot be satisfied without grave .   risk&quot;-to the civil community. , The measures by- wmch this difficulty might be overcome will form the suoject of a sub-sequent memorandum.
