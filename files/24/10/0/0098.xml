SjLCIB -E T..C-.T. 496. WAR OABIHET.&quot;.&apos;. .RSSER7ATIQ1 OF CEREALS LOR EUMAB FOOL. (Memorandum by Lord Levonport).I em taking steps to restrict the use of cereals of all kinds for any other purpose than direct, human consump-tion.  .. So far as wheat end rice are concerned, the textile industry is.mainly affected, but other industries concerned are the Laundries, billposters, etc who use either wheat or rice for stanch or paste.     The use of wheat for stock has &quot;been prohibited . for three months past.     As regards &apos; maize, I propose to prohibit its use for all purposes except human consumption and the feeding of animals.     In view of the objections to specific prohibition of the use of maize for pigs and for farmers1 stoeh, it is thought desirable to restrict its use for these purposes by indirect means.     The Departments of Agriculture are co-operating in this direction, and the Wheat Commission,, who now control the whole of the supplies of maize, will also assist by giving&apos; the Lemanda of millers preference for all that they can take.     In this way it is believed&apos; that very.shortly the use of maize for animal feeding will be gradually abolished.     As regards barley I have made an order commandeering the whole of the stocks in the Country, other than home-grown barley which has not been kiln dried.     This latter is a very small quantity, estimated at not more than 5fo of the whole still remaining in the hands of farmers.     I propose to reserve for bread-making the whole of the stocks of &quot;barley thus secured, subject to possibly some slight exceptions where barley may be found to be unsuitable for human food, and will therefore be released.     The Order calls for a return &quot;before the 30th-,instant, of all stocks held, and until these returns are received, a &quot;precise figure cannot be given.      It is estimated, however, that the quantity will be somewhere about 1,750,000 quarters.The question of oats must be treated separately..The Committee recently appointed on the Utilisation and Feeding of Horses has had under consideration the question of limiting the rations of horses throughout the United Kingdom-. They report that evidence obtained by them shows that there is a wide diversity of practice amongst horse owners in the amount &quot;and class of grain used, and that there is a considerable amount of waste arising largely from a lack of knowledge and supervision.     They suggest that hq horse not engaged upon useful work should consume grain at tho present time, and that no feelings of sentiment should be allowed to stand in the way of destroying old and useless animals.     They point out that the average amount of grain consumed by one horse in a week is sufficient to.provide the flour ration for- twenty-one persons for the same period.     They recommend the issue of an appeal to all owners of horses, to limit the grain supplies to horses, in accordance with the following scale which has been carefully compiled on expert advice.&apos;
Horses other than those used       5 pounds of grain and 12 pounds for agricultural and business      of hay per day,. ttatil the end purposes, of.April.   All such horsesshould be put to grass or fed entirely on hay from the beginning of Hay to September. &apos;Horses used&apos; for trade and business purposes in hard and oontinr^i work.(a) Hoavy dray or cart horses,   32 pounds of mixture per day,(b) Trotting vanners. . 29 pounds of mixture per day, (o)   Light horses and cobs, 22 pounds of mixture per dayyThe mixture to consist of a maximum of one-half grain, tho balance being; chaff *It must bo remembered that 16-^lbs, of oats may be replaced in food value by 9-lbs, of maise and S-lbs. of beans.The conservation of the stocks of oats, which how amount to 2,893,000 quarters, but are being rapidly depleted, is a matter of urgent importance, and I am prepared to limit their consumption by horses to the utmost possible extent.   It is clear that horses engaged in agricultural and transport work must receive corn as part of their rations, and the suggestions made by the Committee as regards this class of horses seem to be reasonable.The suggestion that no other horses should be permitted to receive any corn from the 1st&quot;of.May to the end of September, requires consideration.   Broadly, I am prepared to prohibit corn for&apos;all horses used for other than agricultural or business purposes,, with some reservation probably for stallions and mares in foal.    This, however, would have the effect of stopping racing, a&amp;d on this point I ask the Cabinet for a decision. Tho consumption of oats by race horses is very considerable.,   I am informed that a race-horse in training&quot;will receive from 14 to 16-lbs, 6f oats per day.   As there are about 4,000 horses In training, this moans an annual consumption of 9,100 tons of oats, which at tho present time are badly needed for human food.(Signed).
