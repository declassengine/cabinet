Reprinted fromThursday, April 12, 1917.GERMAN COLONIAL AIMS.1At&quot;CENTRAL AFRICA.&quot;THE LAST STAGE OF &quot;WORLD-POWER&quot; (By Our Correspondent formerly in Berlin.)Since the earliest stages of the war German colonial ambitions have been veiled in an official reticence that is in marked contrast with the abundant discussion of German political and economic aims in other spheres. The Imperial Chancellors speeches have contained only the vaguest and most&apos; perfunctory references to colonial events and possibilities. When the Colonial Secretary, Herr Solf, made a lecture tour of Germany a year ago, the cnief result was that he became involved in controversy as to whether he does or does not consider that Germany&apos;s colonial aims are fundamentally de-pendent upon the achievement of her naval aims.The reasons for caution are clear enough. Herr Solf and his colleagues began the war with futile proposals for the neutralization of Africa, and. adopting an air of injured innocence, insisted upon the essentially &quot;non-military &quot; character of German colonial policy and upon the wickedness of destroying by war the soli-darity of.the white rices in face of native popu-lations.    Glad though they might be to take anything they can get. they are no longer aiming at the possession of territory&apos;without military guarantees, and they have no desire by further talk of &quot; white race prestige &quot; to provoke the answer that the best way to preserve the prestige of the white races is to perpetuate their extermination of German rule.  Secondly, although all the German political parties with the   Socialist   Majority  extremely  prominent among them are pledged to a colonial policy, even the colonial enthusiasts have little taste at present for public propaganda, in view of the fluctuations o.nd disappointments of the war, and in view of the rude public belief that the German Colonies have proved to be at best easily-conquered   &quot; pawns &quot;   which   counter-balance   or   outweigh   Germany&apos;s   hard-won &quot; pawns &quot; in Europe.   But, above all, Ger-many desires to divert the world&apos;s attention as long as possible from the indisputable fact that her schemes of &quot; colonial &quot; policy are schemes of world-power, and are being considered in term \ of strategy and &quot; the next war.&quot; Th   i nd of the Economic Argument./ olonies, in the German jargon, are objects either of &quot; world-economics &quot; or of &quot; world-fpolitics.&quot;   German war literature has finally .:&apos; removed all shadow of doubt that the economic ( aim is now definitely subordinated to the political aim.    The whole German colonial movement now subscribes absolutely to the doctrine of Professor Hans Delbriick, the Berlin historian,  that* &quot; German world-policy is in reality nothing but colonial policy conceived on large lines,&quot; and that the essence of the matter is the German &quot; claim no longer to be passed over in the distribution of the world, but to be equipped with a considerable colonial Empire of her own, wherever it may be sought  presumably in Central Africa &quot; ; and to the doctrine  of  Professor  Wiedenfeld,  of  Jena, that colonies are primarily  &quot; world-political&quot;The war has knocked the bottom out of the purely economic argument. It was formerly the German habit to inform benevolent but ignorant foreign opinion that all Germany wanted was &quot; an outlet for her surplus popula-tion.&quot; That fiction, at least, is now dead, and should be buried. It was exposed before the war by such an authority as the former Im-perial Minister of the Interior, Count Posa-dowsky. The last word on the subject is said (Nord mid Siid, February, 1917) by Baron von Rechenberg, formerly Governor of German East Africa : Just as we lack available land for settling, so we lack suitable German settlers. . . &apos; . For a number of years immigration into Germany has been much greater than emigration from Germany. . . . Even in times of peace German agriculture had not a Eurplus but a shortage of labour, and it cannot possibly accord with our interests to increase the shortage by encouraging emigration. ... Re-grettable though it is, there can be no question at the conclusion of peace of acquiring extensive terri-tory for settlement; there is no appropriate country and there are no farmers to settle on it.All that remains of the purely economic argument is wild discussion of the need to secure for Germany new sources &quot; of her own &quot; for the supply of raw materials. The German &quot; Africans &quot; rival the German &quot; Central Euro-peans&quot; in compilation of statistics, but the statistics are not more serious than the argu-ment of the Socialist Deputy, Herr Severing, that labour conditions in Germany will be better if the raw materials come from &quot; German&quot; than if they come from &quot; foreign &quot; sources ! &quot; Weltpolitik V and an African &quot; Bloc.&quot;In fact, Weltpolitik is the root of the whole matter, and I propose to show the present trend of German ambition. The central idea is the - establishment of a solid German bloc in Africa, geographically united and mihtarilv impregnable.   Rmmnrf tViof ;^oo iioo +U-  v.&quot;and the Frankfurter Zeitung (The Timesr September 26, 1916) has, in a fit of candour, explained how Turkey, so far from being an independent foreign Ally, should be fitted into German Kolonialpolitik as a new &quot; Austra-Jia.&quot; But the Asiatic goal has never been essential to the African goal, and the more Germany&apos;s Eastern ambitions dwindle, the further the hope of the conquest of Egypt recedes, the more certain will it appear to the German mind that the true goal never lay beyond Baghdad, but in Africa. Berlin to Lake Chad.This process has already gone far enough for Herr Emil Zimmermann, the well-known &quot; Colonial &quot; publicist, to explain, in an enter-taining article in the February number of the Preussische Jahrbiicher, that when the German Emperor and Empress went to Constantinople and Damascus in 1898, their political destina-tion was not the Persian Gulf, but . ake Chad. He writes : -When, 50 years hence, German Central Africa contains among 50,000,000 niggers 500,000 or more Germans, and when great cities have grown up on Lake Chad, on the Congo, on Lake Tanganyika, it will be nothing unusual for a Berlin wholesale firm to give the following order to its traveller at the beginning of September: &quot; Pack your samples, take the Congo express, and travel to the autumn fair at Wilhelmstadt (which will then be the name of Stanleyville) ; we expect your order in three or four weeks, and the goods will arrive in Africa at the beginning of December.&quot;The journey from Berlin will take seven days to the Congo and Lake Tanganyika, five days to Lake Chad ; express traffic will go via the Mediterranean and North Africa, and goods traffic by the old sea routes from the North Sea ports. A new and pro-sperous world will have arisen in the Mediterranean, and this development will have dated from the German Emperor&apos;s journey of 1898 from William the Traveller to the East.Elsewhere (Deutsche Politik, August, 1916) Herr Zirnmermann has explained what Ger-many&apos;s leap across the Mediterranean will mean in &quot; world politics &quot; : German Africa, which will- find allies at once in Abyssinia and in Mahomedan freedom movements, will make the employment of black troops against our European frontiers impossible. German Africa alone will give us a balance of power in the East and in Africa. It will remove the Egyptian pressure on Asia Minor, and give to Italy freedom of, movement as against her present allies and to Spain and Greece the necessary relief. German Africa will make us a world-power by enabling us to exert decisive influence upon the world-political decisions of our enemies and of other Powers and to exercise pressure on all shapings of policy in Africa, Asia Minor, and southern Europe. &quot; German Africa &quot; and &quot; the Next War.&quot;That is one aspect of &quot; German Africa.&quot; But it is not all.   &quot; German Africa&quot; is also to solve the problem of sea power, to destroy the strategic unity of the British Empire, and to complete the German &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; which can be fully achieved neither by increase of the German Navy nor even by possession of the Belgian coast.   In 1912 the German Government inspired an extraordinary pam-phlet called &quot;German World-Policy and No War.&quot;   It was intended for the   immediate purposes of Lichnowsky diplomacy, to show that German aims in Asia Minor were strictly limited in the main confined to the com-pletion of the Baghdad Railway and that the proper solution in the interests of Germany and of peace was the establishment of. a Ger-man Central Africa through the acquisition of the Belgian Congo and the possessions  of Portugal.   But in a passage on strategy the author lets the cat out of the bag. He explained that &quot; Central Africa &quot; would be impregnable on land, being able to defy &quot; the militia of the South African Union,&quot;  which was j&quot; much too feeble for attack or conquest,&quot; ahd that, while the Suez Canal would doubtless be closed on the outbreak of war, and England would have to rely entirely on the Cape route to India, the German Navy, once outside the North Sea and the Channel, would  enjoy the most favourable conditions.   German writers are now more precise.   They assume that the new &quot; German Africa&quot; will consist at least of the old German colonies, the whole of the Belgian Congo, the whole of French Equatorial Africa and Angola.   It will contain not only an adequate garrison with adequate supplies, but local munition factories.   Germany will have naval bases at Dar-es-Salaam, the mouth of the Cameroon estuary, the mouth of thej Congo, on the coast of Angola, and on the coast of South-West Africa.   The picture is sketched, for example, by Herr Franz Kolbe, jin the February number of Deutsche Politik, and he proceeds: The whole coast of West Africa from the mouth of the Cross River to the mouth of the Orange River would be in German possession. When one Sonly re-members what immense achievements were performed by the Emden in the Indian Ocean and by the Karls-ruhe in the Atlantic, without any naval base, without any possibility of replenishing in port their supplies of munitions, food, &amp;c, it will be realized what &quot;the forfcifi-&quot; .......rl---------&apos; - de&quot;h v

The central idea is the1 establishment of a solid German 6Zoc in Africa, geographically united and militarily impregnable. Beyond that idea lies the ambi-tion of linking &quot; German Africa &quot; with &quot; Central Europe &quot; and the Near East, and of creating a perpetual menace both to &quot; the backbone &quot;  usually located in Egypt of the British Empire, and to all present and future combina-, tions of non-German Powers.There is no doubt that the German Colonial Office has embraced the doctrine of the Colonial bloc. Herr Solf, in spite of all his caution, con-tributed the following pronouncement to a &quot; colonial calendar &quot; for 1917 : The history of our colonies in this world-war has shown what was hitherto wanting in the German colonial Empire. It has shown that it just was not a proper &quot; Empire &quot; at all, but merely a number of possessions without geographical and political con-nexion  and  without  established   communications.. . . How greatly would the power of resist-ance of our colonies have been increased if they had not been isolated ! . . . These experiences show what direction our aims must take. We shall achieve the fulfilment of our desires if we remain conscious that the colonial-political aim is not some-thing which stands alone by itself, but must be re-garded in organic connexion with all other aims which we are determined to attain by the world war.This pronouncement was accepted at once by all Colonial enthusiasts as satisfactory. Let us see what they mean.&quot; Central Europe &quot; (Mitteleuropa) has taken definite shape during the war; &quot; Central Africa &quot; (Mittelafrika) was already talcing shape in the period of the Anglo-German detente, the period between 1912 and 1914 when Prince Lichnowsky and the British Foreign Office were negotiating treaties concerning Africa and Mesopotamia, and international finance, by debate in the Wilhelrnstrasse, was calmly carving up the whole of Turkey in Asia into what were called &quot; spheres oi action.&quot; Germany was then showing her hand in the great game which was already intended to end in the linking-up of the German bloc in Africa and the German 6Zoc in Asia. This &quot; ideal &quot; has been best expounded by that brilliant Swedish Pan-German, Professor Kjellen, in his &quot; Political Problems of the World-War,&quot;that German aims in Asia Minor were itotricEF, limited-in the main confined to the com-pletion of the Baghdad Railway and that the proper solution in the interests of Germany and of peace was the establishment of, a Ger-man Central Africa through the acquisition of the Belgian Congo and the possessions of Portugal. But in a passage on strategy the author lets the cat out of the bag. He explained that &quot; Central Africa &quot; would be impijegnable on land, being able to defy &quot; the militia of the South African Union,&quot; which was &quot;much too feeble for attack or conquest,&quot; and that, while the Suez Canal would doubtless be closed on the outbreak of war, and England would have to rely entirely on the Cape route to India, the German Navy, once outside the North Sea and the Channel, would enjoy the most favourable conditions. German writers are now more precise. They assume that the new &quot; German Africa&quot; will consist at least of the old German colonies, the whole of the Belgian Congo, the whole of French Equatorial Africa and Angola. It will contain not only an adequate garrison with adequate supplies, but local munition factories. Germany will have naval bases at Dar^es-Salaam, the mouth of the Cameroon estuary, the mouth of the Congo, on the coast of Angola, and on the coast of South-West Africa. The picture is sketched, for example, by. Herr Franz Kolbe, in the February number of DeutscJie Politik, and he proceeds: The whole coast of West Africa from the mouth of the Cross River to the mouth of the Orange River would be in German possession. When one only re-members what immense achievements were performed by the Emden in the Indian Ocean and by the Karls-ruhe in the Atlantic, without any naval base, without any possibility of replenishing in port their supplies of munitions, food, &amp;c, it will be realized what the fortifl-cation of half the West Coast of Africa would signify for Germany and for England ! As soon as, in a new war, the Suez Canal is closed against England by the Turks, all traffic between England and India, Aus-tralia and South Africa must go round the Cape of Good Hope. But then all the shipping must pass the coast of German Central Africa f It would be im-possible for England any longer to concentrate her whole Fleet in the North Sea and to menace Germany. She would be compelled to station a considerable fleet in South Africa for the protection of her trade, and that would mean a not inconsiderable weakening of her forces in European waters.Such utterances seem extravagant ; so did the writings of Bernhardi and the rest before the war. What are they but the logical develop-ment of Herr Solfs &quot; colonial-political aim,&quot; and,of the formula of any German politician ?The truth is that there is no &quot; moderate &quot; or limited German colonial policy. As writers of the Socialist minority often demonstrate, the professors like Delbfiick, the &quot; Central Euro-peans &quot; like Naumann, the Conservatives, Clericals, National Liberals, and the Socialists like Jansson, Quessel, Severing, and Lensch, are all one ; &quot; it is simply a question of Macht-politik &quot; (Neue Zeit, February 23). Colonial Pan-Germanism has gone the full circle, and has. returned to the sheer militarism, based upon, sentiment and prestige, which was rampant at the close of the Franco-German War. Kolonialpolitik is only a form of Weltpolilik,. and its fate, as the Germans perceived at the beginning of the war, but say less often now,, must, of necessity, be settled on the battlefields, of Europe.Meanwhile the silence of the German Colonial Office does not mean that it is idle. It is. tabulating and pigeon-holing its plans, and adapting them, no doubt, from time to time to the alterations of the military and political situation. Thej&apos; will be produced, in abund-ance and variety, when the right moment comes best of all if peace seems to be in other respects assured; short of that, if the opportunity&apos; arrives to promote dissension in the Entente by representing their rejection as the only obstacle to peace.6905Printed and Published by The Times Publishing Company, Limited, Printing-house-square, London, E.C. 4*.
