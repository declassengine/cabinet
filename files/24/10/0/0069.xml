The Department has since been engaged in the preparation and issue of - instructions to Inspectors as to the procedure to be adopted in giving effect to this decision and as to the desirability of encouraging the forma-tion of suitable Vacation Classes for the younger children.I        A suggestion for the establishment of a novel type of Training College, designed to train teachers for nursery schools, has beenunder consideration and a proposal has been made for opening a College for training teachers in the Montessori methods.Revised Regulations for Special schools, codifying and bring-ing up to date the former Regulations, have been issued, together with new Regulations for tne continued instruction of the students formerly in attendance at Special schools.     It has been increas-ingly recognised that much of the.value of the work of special Schools (particularly those for the Blind) is lost unless further training for employment is provided, and the present Regulations are intended to encourage the establishment of suitable courses of training.I have made arrangements with the Statutory Committee with regard to the use of Technical schools for the Training of Disabled Soldiers and have submitted them to the Treasury.13th April, 1917,
