Sir 31st December 1916.I have the honour to submit a report on the Summer Season at.Archangel.2. I arrived at Archangel on the 29th April 1916, with a very small Staff lor the work contemplated, it, having been considered doubtful whether a British Principal Naval Transport Officer and Staff would be tolerated.3. The first month was taken up in establishing my office and learning the pecu-liaritiesof the Russian character. At first there was suspicion as to our sphere, but with the aid of Lieutenant Count Benckendorff, of the Imperial Russian NaVy, to whom my thanks are due, suspicion was to a large extent worn down and less obstruction shown as the season advanced. The work, however, was never really easy, we being foreign, practically controlling the Port. Further, it must always be realised that there is a large body of Russians who consider themselves perfectly capable of managing their own affairs. Unfortunately, one found very few experienced seamen among the Russian officials, and practically none who realised the supreme importance of despatching freight ships as rapidly as possible.4. My difficulties were added to by the fact that none of my staff knew the Russian language when we first arrived,* and even now this want of knowledge continually makes itself felt when dealing with minor officials whose education has not included a study of French or G erman.5. Contract with R. Martens &amp; Co., Ltd. Generally speaking, arrangements under this contract were satisfactory.* * * * * *t&quot;. The Russian Commander-in-Chief, for some reason, had a very strong objection to the firm, so much so that he pretended he had never heard of the firm of &quot; Martens,&quot; and in local communications they were referred to as &quot;Admiralty Agents.&quot;9. Bakaritza, where the principal discharging berths are situated, is on the opposite side of the river, some 5 miles away (see attached sketch map of the port). The Russian Authorities would ndt allow any of the agents in the city to communicate with Bakaritza by telephone, with the result that all messages had to be brought down by Tug boat or Ferry, with consequent great loss of time. This source of delay should be done away with and the Russian Authorities approached officially with a view to installing^ proper public telephonic facilities between Archangel and Bakaritza.$13. In the daily returns made by the Admiralty Agents, and from my own observations, it was usually found that the delay in discharging ships was not due to stevedoring but to the porterage, which was very poor, the stevedore disposing his workmen according to porterage. The Porters, however, were in their turn handi-capped to a certain extent by an insufficiency of Customs Clerks at the storage places.* * -s -s b &amp;21. Other Stevedoring firms, with the exception of Morducovitch, did their work satisfactorily, but Schmidts.were at times short of labour.* Efforts are being made to secure more Russian-speaking officers for 1917 season.f The firm, in so far as it is connected Avith the carriage of Russian Government cargoes, has recently been1 reconstituted, the interests cf Mr. Martens, and his personality, being eliminated. The Agency will continue without interruption under the title &quot; Russo-British Transport Co.&quot; at Archangel.\ This is being taken up with the Russian Authorities.I The porters are supplied and paid by the Russians. It is of- the utmost importance that the Russians should be forced to improve their porterage system for next year. This will be taken up in connection witli the renewal of the Agreement for 1917, aud has been rep sented to the Mission in Petrograd as a point of the first importance.
*26. Porterage. This has been indifferent throughout the season. The Porterage firms were paid their disbursements plus a percentage. This system did not lead to quick dispatch. There was a great shortage of carts and horses, and the number of Customs Clerks for tallying and receiving goods was insufficient.*27. Better organisation is required in this direction, which must be carried out by the Russians.28. In the case of shortage of labour on the Quays, it is first of all reported to my office, then by me by telephone to the Russian Transport Office, and by personal report to the Commander-in-Chief. Promises are usually made that the matter will be attended to at once, but, as a matter of fact, nothing happens until the following day. A more direct method of getting the porterage speeded up must be adopted. The system of paying disbursements plus a percentage is unsatisfactory. It would be interesting to know how quick dispatch, as far as porterage is concerned, is obtained in ports in the United Kingdom, and I would suggest pressing for the adoption of a system of payment by piece-work on a tonnage basis if this has been found to have good results in other ports.29. The whole question of rapidly discharging ships at Archangel is determined by that of labour, which was becoming very serious at the end of the season, partly due to the fact that there was an increasing shortage and to its high cost.30. Next season the cost of labour will probably be still higher and the shortage greater. It is essential that this question, also the building of suitable carts during the winter, be tackled by the Russian Government without delay.131. Coal Discharge. The Contractors, Messrs. Morducovitch, were quite unable to deal with this large contract, owing principally to the shortage of labour. Large numbers of women and children were employed, and in some cases the children were quite unable to dig coal and Masters of ships refused to allow them to work in their holds.32. Coal discharge can be divided into three sections : -(1) Bakaritza into wagons and stacks, with long pier lead. (2) Into barges.(3) Stacks at Solombala and Moses Island with short lead.33. It is suggested that more than one contractor should be employed. Separate contractors for each of the discharging stations 1, 2, and 3 would probably best meet the case.  This should also stimulate competition.34. A rate of discharge of 400 tons per 24 hours was seldom exceeded (see season&apos;s coal discharge returns).35. Morducovitch was quite unable to work efficiently at night as well as day, owing to the shortage of labour and lighters. It is desirable that the Russian Govern-ment should be called upon to state what arrangements they propose to make next season for the proper provision of lighters and barges. A great many more are required.37. Whatever is decided, steps should be taken as soon as possible in order that the contractors may have ample time within which to provide themselves with the necessary material required.38. Coal at Kem. The discharge of coal at Kem was conducted under the supervision of Lieutenant C. T; Hilder, R.N.R. The rate of discharge was better than at Archangel&apos;; five berths were available with a discharge of about 500 tons per dav per berth. Here again difficulties were experienced from want of native organisation, food supplies, and shortage of labour.* The Russians have already been informed that on the adequate supply of shore; labour depends the supply of tonnage by H.M. Government.The provision of a sufficiency of carts is part of the same question : it is reported that Admiral Korviu has already ordered these.f Steps have already been taken (a) to make it clear to the Russian Government that the coal stevedoring must Jt)e in Britishhands ; :-(b) to arrange a contract with the Russo-British Transport Co. as successors to Messrs. Martens. Arrangements are in hand to divide the work as suggested.
* Negotiations are in progress for &quot;the acquisition by the Russian Government through the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company of two 1,000-ton Brazilian bunkering vessels. The question has been taken up with the Russians of putting all bunkering arrangements under the P.N.T.O. The supply of haulabouts also has been taken up.t-It is proposed to arrange for a separate stack of Durham coal for the P.N.T.O.&apos;s own use for bunkering.J This delay must cernainly be avoided if possible, and Admiral Korvin will be asked to state what information is needed by the time the ship arrives to avoid it.^ The Russian Government have agreed to suspend public holidays.39. bunkering of Ships. -It&apos; had been contemplated under the agreement between the two countries that steamers would be bunkered for the round voyage. In the case of General Cargo Steamers they usually had sufficient coal to enable them to return to the United Kingdom, but in the case of Colliers this was not so, with the result that a large number put in applications involving a petition to the Coal Department at the War Port Offices, usually followed up by a personal application that the coalmight be granted and supplied as soon as possible. ^Facilities for bunkering ships are very primitive, there being only two bunkering berths at Moses Island, with the result that generally speaking a ship cannot be bunkered while she is discharging or loading cargo, except in the case of Colliers, when it is transferred from the holds.40. The rate of bunkering is also very slow 40 to 50 tons a day seldom being-exceeded, but this rate is considerably reduced when it is taken into consideration the time lost in shifting ships to bunkering berths, waiting for labour, &amp;c.41. Bunkering by night is practically non-existent.42. It seems that, owing to changes in route, it is not an easy matter to bunker ships sufficiently for a round voyage. Having regard to the enormous amount of time occupied in bunkering ships at Archangel (over 150 requisitioned ships were bunkered during the season); it is for consideration whether it would not be better to have over-bunkering in the United Kingdom, rather than run the risk of the delay to the ship through having to supply her with bunkers at Archangel.44. It is suggested that four Iron Barges or haulabouts be placed at my disposal holding 200 to 500 tons of coal, and that arrangements be made with the Russians whereby the supply of bunkering coal to British requisitioned ships shall be controlled by me, so that all that should be necessary would be to apply for coal to keep barges supplied instead of the present I system of making a separate petition for each lot of bunkers wanted, with consequent delays due to non-arrival of barges, difficulty in obtaining Russian Coal Checkers, delay in transmission of orders from the War Port to Coal Contractors, and difficulty in getting Coal Contractors to supply sufficient labour to supply bunkers promptly. The Russians should be pressed at once to make adequate bunkering arrangements, for even if full bunkers are supplied from United Kingdom, there will always be some ships requiring coal, e.g., owing to diversion to other White Sea ports or to longer sea route due to presence of Enemy Submarines, &amp;c.45. Berthing Ships. Generally speaking all the General Cargo Ships have been berthed within 24 hours of arrival, but cases  have occurred in which ships have been kept waiting as long as two days, although berths have been available. It is suggested that the Russian Authorities&apos; attention should be officially drawn to this point, and the waste of tonnage explained to them.46. I see no reason why general cargo ships should not go direct to the discharging berth. The excuse given to me for not doing this has always been that manifests^ must be examined in order to detail the berth the ship has to go to. Russian Officials allege that the informatiou supplied by the Admiralty by wire is insufficient to berth the ships promptly. This difficulty would be obviated to some extent if the Admiralty telegram, in addition to detailing the main kinds of cargo in each ship gave the weights of the strictly military portions of cargo which are naturally given precedence.$47. A further cause of delay was due to public holidays. In the estimates seen for the season&apos;s work, 25 weeks is quoted as the duration of the season, but the summer public holidays amounts to about two weeks.48. An attempt was made, on my representation, to continue work during public holidays, but it would only be considered as being partially effective.
49. Petrograd must lay down definitely that public holidays are to cease to exist during the season.50. The greatest source of delay is caused by the general shortage of labour everywhere, particularly on the quays.51.* This shortage will be far more serious next year, owing to the military levies, and is, in my opinion, the most difficult problem of all to be solved. Until solved no paper programmes with regard to the capabilities of the port are of much value.&apos; 52. From my experience of native methods I may here remark that verbal assurances from the Russians with regard to the supply of labour have not proved satisfactory. The question of labour supply must be taken up at once with Petrograd.The only suggestions I have with regard to labour are (1) That an attempt be made to release all men whose previous occupation was that of a stevedore or porter in the Baltic and Black Sea ports, for service at Archangel.(2) That battalions of well seasoned and disciplined troops be drafted into Archangel, and that the necessary accommodatiou be taken in hand at once. Last season an attempt was made to obtain military labour and some troops were sent; the majority were either sick or wounded from hospitals.53. Moreover, difficulties arising from employing military labour at military rates of a few kopecs per diem alongside civil labour earning up to 12 rbls. a day resulted in very little work being done by the military. It might be feasible to use conscripted labour throughout.54. I might here mention that in all papers I have seen with regard to future programmes, no mention is ever made regarding the supply of labour for carrying out the said programmes.55. This shortage of labour is not applicable to Archangel only, complaints were also received from Kem, Tchupa, Kandalaksha, and Romanoff to the same effect.56. Russian Harvest. During the past season as soon as the harvest started, civil labour disappeared in an extraordinary manner. In many cases it was reported that men left their work and went into the country without even drawing their pay. The effect of this was badly felt for six weeks, and after the harvest large numbers of men did not return.57. This is a matter which must also be taken up with Petrograd, as the officials in Archangel, including the Commander-in-Chief, seemed powerless and did not take the matter seriously. Petrograd went so far as to wire the Commander-in-Chief to say that P.JSLT.O. must wait until the harvest season was over.58. There is little doubt in my mind that the officials are obviously afraid to deal seriously with the labour problem, and in no case did they attempt to prevent labour leaving the port for the harvest. It is therefore necessary that the Russian Govern-ment should make arrangements during the winter to supply sufficient prisoners of war to gather in the harvest in 1917 so that the military necessity of discharging ships may not be interfered with, particularly during the harvest period of the year when it is light all night and the weather most suitable for quick discharge and loading.59. Wet Season. Russian labourers will not work during wet weather. Fortu-nately last season was a comparatively dry one, with little rain for three months, but we cannot be certain of such weather next year. This points to the necessity for arranging to discharge vessels in all weathers. As a matter of fact, the Military Authorities actually withdrew their men when rain commenced.60. It would be of very great assistance in this respect if means could be devised for supplying wet weather clothing for the labourers, whether civil or military.   The* These remarks are fully concurred in. It. is a most important and serious matter which is engaging anxious attention here. It has already been strongly represented to the Russians, whose difficulties hi this respect are curiously like our own. The soluiiou propounded in $ 52 (2) seems the best. Jn the agreement of May 1916 the Russian Government guaranteed sufficient labour.to keep the port going to its full capacity night and day.   The Russian Government have now agreed to adopt the scheme an ^52 (2).
military have no protection against the weather, and no change of uniform. (This, -of course, explains also their dislike of working coal.)61. Delays at Night. Night discharge of general cargo was very badly carried out, and practically did not obtain in the case of colliers.62. My experience in discharging general cargo ships was that after midnight Russian officials could not be found on the quays.* This bad work at night was due, in my opinion, to the want of determination and lack of energy on the part of the higher officials to get the work done, and to organise the necessary day and night supervising staff. It is also essential that more Customs officials are required both for day and night work.63. Delays in Loading-Generallj speaking, delays were few; but here again one was tip against&apos; the labour problem. Although the loading was carried out at a rate never before reached at Archangel, it still leaves much to be desired.66. &apos;\Loading Timber. Generally speaking, the loading of timber has gone well throughout the season, and although improvements could perhaps be made in some directions, it is not possible to expect much difference in the general despatch of timber steamers, as this has always been the principal export of the place. It is, of course, possible that loading might be seriously affected if the authorities continue to draw off for military service all the experienced labourers who have worked for years at the various mills. The situation was gradually becoming worse in the latter part of the season, with the result that not only was the despatch falling off and the cost of loading increasing, but there was a very marked decrease in the intake of the steamers, the inexperienced hands, largely women, being quite unequal to the task of giving good stowage; the result was badly stoAved holds and consequently poor deck cargoes. Over and above the question of despatch m loading, it must also be taken into account that millowners are already looking forward to the possibility of having to close down altogether next season, as there is every probability that they will be so crippled for want of men that they will not be able to run their mills. It is understood that the lack of men to fell the trees in the interior will create a shortage of logs for cutting, which will very adversely affect the quantity of sawn goods available for shipment during open water 1917, and the prospects are that the following season the shortage of logs will be very much greater, unless arrangements are made by the Russians to fell wood during this winter. It is understood, however, that there will be about  150,000 standards of sawn timber available for shipment next season.69. Loading Flax. Captain Proctor made the necessary arrangements for loading. Martens supplied the stevedores, contracts being made by Captain Proctor for bringing cargo to ship&apos;s side.70. The principal firms employed were Helmsing and Grim, Kneip and Werner, and the East Asiatic Shipping Co., Ltd.71. $Delays resulted from insufficiency of the necessary technical staff who could translate the Russian marks on the bales into English. This deficiency in staff also prevented loading by night a serious waste of time during the summer when it is light all night.74. It is desirable that Captain Proctor be asked what steps he is taking to ensure quicker despatch next season,   jj Captain Proctor is of great value at Archangel,* One cannot expect to change the Russian character, but it iis anticipated that Admiral Korvin will be an improvement on his predecessor in energy.f Loading Timber. The report is fully endorsed. The question of en bloc Government purchase of all available supplies has been urged through the Foreign Office, but with what results is not yet known. Colliery owners are being encouraged to negotiate for pit props, which are more quickly prepared than sawn timber, but terms of shipment and discharge are to be subject to the approval of T. Department. The estimate of 180,000 standards available sawn wood is supported &apos;by what information is available here.J The latest Russian estimate for next season is 300,000 standards.$ Presumably insufficiency of staff on the part of the contractors, who had to bring the cargo to the ship&apos;s side.II Concur that Captain Proctor should be retained at Archangel for flax.A3
owing to his thorough knowledge of the flax position and of the Russian language. As I understand, this officer is endeavouring to rejoin his regiment for work in the trenches, I consider it highly desirable that his services be retained for Archangel, and that the War Office be so informed.76. *Wheat and Alcohol. Wheat and alcohol were only loaded in Hudson Bay ships for France. The firm of Schmidt carried out the loading of these cargoes expeditiously. At one period, however, the wheat was not ready for shipping and the French Consul refused to allow the ships to be used for cargo other than wheat.77. Mr. Armitstead, the manager of the Hudson Bay Company, was entirely powerless to alter the arrangements for the cargo, this being in the hands of the French Consul,78. fit is recommended that in future the services of the French Consul should be dispensed with in such matters, and Mr. ArmitsteacT work directly with the P.N.T.O.82. Berthage Accommodation. At the middle of July 1916 there were available at the port 36 berths for the discharge of general cargo and 25 for the discharge of colliers, in addition to those ships of the latter type which could discharge in the stream. It may be said, therefore, that the berthage accommodation available during the open season of 1916 was fully up to the requirements.83. NotAvithstanding the Bakaritza catastrophe, the position at the beginning of the open season of 19.17 will show a decided improvement upon that which existed in May 1916. Not only will there be a considerably larger number of berths available immediately navigation opens, but the reconstruction of the &quot; temporary &quot; berths will be much more rapid than in previous years owing to the increased number of pile-drivers on the ground.84. The Bakaritza explosion has unfortunately destroyed two of the general cargo berths, and although these can probably be re-erected before next season, the work will be extremely difficult on account of the wreckage overlying the site.J I recommend that periodical information be requested with regard to the progress made during this winter with the work of reconstruction.85. $Unless the wrecks of the &quot;Earl of Forfar&quot; and 100 tons floating crane can he removed, as to which expert opinion might be taken, it will not be practicable to use one at least of the two damaged berths. Reconstruction of the quay is necessary, however, to restore the railway tracks, &amp;c, and to enable as much of the berthage as possible to be employed. I do not recommend the construction, as has been suggested, of a spur projecting from the original quay face to cover the wrecks in question. There are obvious objections to making a break in the continuity of the wharf face.86. Whether it is found feasible or not to remove these wrecks, the river bed in the vicinity should, as soon as the conditions permit, be swept for possible obstructions to navigation.87. It is considered that the number of berths which will or can be made available is sufficient for the discharge during the open season of 1917 of the whole of the tonnage which can be evacuated by the railway in 12 months.89. Fire Appliances. The explosion at Bakaritza destroyed the shore fire-brigade station and equipment. Much valuable time was lost in extemporising fire-fighting gear in tugs, &amp;c.H I submit that, in addition to efficient shore fire appliances at Bakaritza and Archangel, at least two fire salvage steamers are necessary, and should* Great importance is attached to a large export of wheat and alcohol from Russia this year, and satisfactory arrangements are in process of completion ou this point.t A satisfactory agreement on these points has been reached with the H.B. Co. % This is being done.I This is in hand by a local contractor. It will probably be necessary to build over the wrecks, amalga-mating two berths into one. The work is being closely watched from here through periodical reports from Archangel.I This is being arranged.
be obtained anal sent out on the opening of navigation. *It is considered es^emnl that these vessels should be commanded by British masters.92. Storage Accommodation--Theposition with regard to storage accommodation for general cargo at the end of November 1916 was very much better - than at the beginning of the season, and would have been as follows had it not been for the Bakaritza catastrophe: Site.	Under Cover.	Open Platforms.	Total.	Tons.	Tons.	Tons.Bakaritsa       --------	95,000 3,000 14,000 50,000	52,000 16,000 . 10,000	147,000 19,000 14,000 60,000Totals      -	162,000	78,000	240,00093. Although the explosion at Bakaritza caused widespread damage to the shedding at that site, there remained ample for the present winter&apos;s requirements, and the repairs should not occupy more than a few weeks.94. Should it be intended, during the open season of 1917, to import a tonnage of general cargo at all commensurate with the limited capacity of the railway during the year, bearing in mind the tonnage of coal to be rail-borne, it would be necessary to augment considerably the existing accommodation. Both at Bakaritza and Economia there are large unoccupied spaces which could be utilised for the purpose.95. The existing accommodation, however, should be sufficient for an importation of, say, 1,000,000 tons of general cargo, provided that during the open season the railway deals, on an average, with some 5,000 tons daily, i.e., 400 waggons.96. Lighting Arrangements. Attention should be drawn to the question of the lighting arrangements to be made for the latter part of next session. At the instance of P.N.T.O. suitable provision in this respect was well on the way to accomplishment when the explosion occurred. One result of this catastrophe was the demolition of the new electric light station then nearing completion, and it is suggested that no time should be lost in obtaining from the Russian Authorities their proposals for re-establishing an efficient lighting system at this important site. It is understood that suitable arrangements of a temporary character have been made for the present winter.98. Extension of Railway Facilities. The question has been raised as to the feasibility of linking up the two banks of the River Dvina with a permanent railway bridge, and there can be no doubt as to the advantages to be derived therefrom should it be found practicable. These advantages, however, would mainly accrue in the open season of navigation, and it may be pointed out that, in view of the detailed survey work requisite before the best site for such a structure could be determined, it would not appear possible to complete the work in time for the open season of 1917. The matter can, it is suggested, therefore, remain in abeyance until the spring of 1917, when it can be looked into on the ground with the Russian Authorities and a scheme prepared:S*A .*!*. S*A .100. Dredging Direct Channel to Archangel.-A suggestion has been made that the broad and direct channel leading from Archangel through the delta to the sea should be improved by dredging to enable ocean-going steamers to navigate to the port by this route in lieu of by the present navigable channel, the Maimaxa, which is narrow and tortuous.101, While it is true that, as regards navigation, advantages would ultimately be derived when this suggestion had. been successfully carried into effect, the process would occupy a very considerable time, depending to a large extent upon the amount* This can probably be arranged and will be taken up with the Russians.a it
of training work found to be necessary and the dredging plant employed, and during this period disastrous results would be caused.102. Owing to the abstraction, under this scheme, of tidal and upland water from the Maimaksa, the improvement of the direct channel could only be effected at the expense of the former channel, the deterioration in which would be greater than the corresponding gain in the broader channel, and for the period required to establish the new route the Port would possess no deep-water approach.103. Attention may also be drawn to the consequences of the proposal to the saw-mill industries situated on the banks pf the Maimaksa.104. Floating Cranes. In the explosion of November 8th the 100-ton floating crane was wrecked beyond the possibility of repair. A 40-ton crane was also damaged, but it will probably work again next season. Lifts exceeding the capacity of the remaining cranes and running up to nearly 100 tons are not uncommon, e.g , pieces of heavy machinery, large locomotives, and 14-inch naval guns. I understand that next season there will be similar lifts, especially locomotives.* It is, therefore, absolutely necessary that the 100-ton crane be replaced, and it is almost necessary that a second one should be supplied to avoid the great delay when more than one such cargo is in pert at a time. There is no wharfage front substantially enough built to take a shore crane like this ; they must, therefore, be floating and preferably self-propelled, in order to avoid the unnecessary use of tugs for shifting them.106. Buoyed Channel at Kem. Several vessels on entering Kem were badly damaged during past season due to grounding. As it is the intention to use Kem much more next season, it is necessary to request the Russians to have the approaches surveyed immediately ice admits, and the Channel up to the berths buoyed, j108. Tug Facilities. In many cases the Admiralty Agents had to apply to Principal Naval Transport Officer to obtain Tugs to carry out their agency work.i, 110. It is interesting to note that had it not been for the tug &quot; Blackcock &quot; it is doubtful if the Russians would have got the &quot; Huntspill&quot; off at the time of her grounding. So much did the Russians rely on the British tugs and British seaman-like qualities, that in all cases of stranding or difficulty they applied to the Principal Naval Transport Officer for assistance.111. I was given to understand that the Russian Government is acquiring additional tugs for service in the White Sea district, and if this proves correct, the Admiralty Agents will presumably be able to obtain their services. But however many more tugs arrive belonging to the Russians, it is essential J that the Principal Naval Transport Officer should have two good harbour tugs of the &quot; Sunderland &quot; type, British manned, and under his sole control; also one large sea-going tug such as the &quot; Blackcock &quot; for emergency work especially.115. Launches for Transport Work. I was handicapped by only having one Motor Launch Motor Launch No. 68-for work afloat. Transport Officers were obliged to use the ferrys when running, and the Agents&apos; tugs, a most expensive method which also led to much loss of time.116. Requirements in addition to Motor Launch are four steam boats of at least eight knots and capable of berthing their own crews. This last point is of great importance owing to the scarcity of lodging room in Archangel.117. Salvage Work. During the season there have been many calls for a good salvage steamer. A Norwegian salvage steamer was employed on two occasions but was not entirely satisfactory, moreover the employment of a Neutral Salvage Company* Steps are being taken to appropriate one, if not two, large floating cranes, t This would perhaps best be done by the Senior Naval Officer.X No further British tugs will be sent out to the White Sea unless they are under the control of P.N.T.O. The Russians iiave been requested to requisition all the existing tugs there and place them under one Russian Officer with a British Officer assisting him.
was not looked upon with favour by the Russians. I consider it essential that a British Salvage Steamer controlled from the Principal Naval Transport Officer&apos;^ office should be attached to the Port next season. Apart from the saving and curtailing of expenses in salvage, I feel that the supply of such a vessel would be more.in keeping witb a proper control by the British Authorities and would meet with the approval of the whole of the Russian staff.118. Summary. As the result of the experience of last season I recommend as necessary action, to ensure anything like success next season, with probably a larger volume of traffic to deal with :  &apos;(1) That labour be put on a reaRy sound basis both at Archangel and at Kem. The Russian Military Authorities alone can arrange this, and the utmost pressure should be put upon them at once to provide sufficient labour, both skilled and unskilled, by forming labour battalions, under military control, of men from the Russian ports who should be withdrawn from the units to which they have been called up.   No time should be lost as accommodation must be ready by open water.119. I suggest that the Russian Commander-in-Chief, White Sea, be called upon forthwith to state his exact labour requirements both for the ports of Archangel and Kem, on the understanding that discharge and loading of ships will be carried out bv day and night in both ports. These requirements should include Customs Officials and Clerks, Gendarmes, Telephone Operators, and Interpreters for Bakaritza, &amp;c. He should have no difficulties in obtaining the information required as the new Coni-mander-in-Chief Admiral Korvin not only has full information of the programme for 1917, but he was President of a Commission in Archangel last July, as a result of which he wired to Petrograd for 7,000 men in addition to those already employed or available in the port.120. (2) The delays which occurred during the 1916 season should be tactfuQy explained to the Russians together with their causes, and the means of remedying them; and Petrograd should be pressed to take the necessary steps without delay.121. The following are the chief points :-(a) Public holidays to be abolished during period of open navigation.(b) Harvest arrangements to be initiated at once for dealing with the harvest1917, in such a way that no labour will be taken away from the Port of Archangel.(c) Wet weather clothing to be supplied work not to stop for rain.(d) Thorough organisation for work, both day and night, on both banks of river,assuming the average discharge is to be 600 tons in 24 hours; this will require-: -(i) Supply of ample supervising Officers on the quays.(ii) Supply of more Customs Clerks for tallying and storing.(iii) Building of sufficient carts of suitable pattern during the winter.(iv) Efficient lighting of quays and storehouses.(v) Ships to be berthed immediately on arrival.(vi) Efficient telephonic communication between Archangel and Bakaritza. All official agents and stevedoring firms to be able to use this telephone system.Note. Russian Authorities consider 300 tons a day as the average discharge. The reason for this, in my opinion, is that they have an insufficiency of Customs Clerks and supervising staff generally for a rate of discharge of 600 tons, which rate can easily be reached by the stevedores.122. (3) The coal stevedoring must be put on a basis satisfactory to the Admiralty and I suggest more than one contractor.123.-(4) Flax. Captain Proctor&apos;s services should, if possible, be retained for next seasion, and that steps be taken by War Office to prevent delays which occurred last season due to the sorting of bales and marks, shortness of staff of shippers, &amp;c.127. (8) Requirements of material:  (a) Replace of the lost 100-ton crane by two 100-ton cranes, one to be self-propelledO   AS 2840b
(b) Re-erection of power station destroyed at Bakaritza and efficient lightingarrangements made for discharge on right bank of river.(c) Mechanical appliances for more rapid handling of coal, vide Appendix.(d) At least four iron barges or haulabouts for bunkering vessels at their berthwhile loading or discharging.(e) Two harbour tugs and one sea-going tug with British crews under P.N.T.O.&apos;ssole orders.. (/) Four steam boats to convey the Transport Staff to their duties as required ; to accommodate their own crews. Motor Launch No. 68 for P.N.T.O.&apos;s use. (g) A fully-equipped salvage steamer or tug for service under British orders inthe White Sea. (li) Provision of two fire-fighting vessels.(i) Survey Kem harbour and buoy the channel leading to berthage.129. (10) That periodic reports be called for as to re-construction of damaged quays and storehouses at Bakaritza.But I must reiterate that all prospects of success must rest upon the supply[of sufficient and suitable labour and its proper organisation.130. Conclusion. In conclusion, I wish to place on record my thanks for the assistance given me generally by the&quot; Russian Authorities, and particularly by Captain Zuzin, Chief of Staff; Captain Strahovski, Chief of the Russian Transport; Com-mander Polivanoff, and Lieutenant Count Benckendorff. I am greatly indebted to the last-named officer for the way in which he handled the many delicate negotiations writh Russian Authorities, which naturally arose in connection with my work at Archangel. My thanks are also due to Captain Du Castel of the French Army, who loyally supported me and did everything in his power to hasten the despatch of Hudson Bay ships.131. With regard to my own staff a separate submission is attached to this report.135. Furthermore, my thanks are specially due to the Admiralty White Sea Department, who by giving me every assistance, sympathy, and encouragement at all times enabled me and my staff to tackle with far greater confidence the many difficult problems which continually arose. Had it not been for this whole-hearted support, the strong position which the British Transport Officers now hold in Archangel with corresponding prestige would not have been reached.. . 1 have, &amp;c,(Signed)     G. P. Bevan,Captain, R.N. P.N.T.O., Archangel.Copy of covering remarks by Director of Transports.The report of the P.N.T.O., Archangel, on the Summer Season 1916, is submitted for Their Lordships&apos; information.It had been hoped to present at the same time a complete report on the -whole operation from a munitions,-financial and commercial point of view.It appears, however, that it will be some weeks yet before the financial side can be completely wound up.I am loath to. withhold further from the Board this most ably penned Report, and am especially anxious that the services of the various officers mentioned should receive consideration at an early date.The achievement of the British Transport Staff appears to me to be a most notable one, when the circumstances of their appointment are considered.The responsibility for the success of the whole scheme has rested on the P.N.T.O. Had his administration not been a success there is ample evidence that nothing like the quantities actually handled could have been imported, which in view of the difficulties experienced this winter both at Romanoff and Vladivostock would have amounted to a disaster to the allied cause.
ARCHANGEL.
In spite of the difficulties met with, the experiment undertaken by the Admiralty ,in the White Sea has met with success.Every ton of munitions or coal which came forward for shipment was despatched, and barring a few losses, discharged at the White Sea ports.In addition, large amounts of fish and private cargo were imported, and very large quantities of timber, flax, wheat, &amp;c, exported. The total work of the port was nearly double that of the preceding season.Two tabular statements showing the exact quantities dealt with in comparison with 1915 are attached.The experiences of the past season have only tended to confirm me in my opinion  on which my proposals of February 1916 were based that the White Sea ports can only be made to deal with the vast quantities of stores needing importation, if the regulation of the traffic, the defence of the sea, the management of the tonnage, and the working of the ports remain essentially, if not nominally, in British hands.(Signed)     Graeme Thomson,Director of Transports. 14th February 1917.Note by Director of Transports, 26th February 1917.Since the above report was made to Their Lordships, negotiations have been proceeding between this Department and the Russian Government, through the medium of the Senior Naval Officer and the British Mission in Petrograd, as to the arrangements for next season.Demands based upon Captain Bevan&apos;s report have been put forward, and it wiU be seen from the attached copy of a telegram from Sir George Buchanan that the Russian Government have agreed thereto.It is realised, however, that constant pressing here, at Petrograd, and at Archangel, will be necessary if these promises are to be carried out.-(Signed)      Graeme Thomson,Director of Transports.These recommendations have, by direction of Fourth Sea Lord, been put forward separately.As regards the report, a detailed commentary on the points raised is attached thereto.Generally speaking, I concur with the opinion expressed by P.N.T.O. as to the measures to be taken regarding next season.Many of his suggestions point to the ideal and will not be realised, since many of the difficulties will only be eliminated by a change in the Russian character. There is no doubt&apos;the crux of the whole position is the shore labour.This the Russians will readily guarantee as they did last year. The difficulty is to make them carry out the guarantee.Last season our only weapon was to stop shipments when congestion became inevitable, and this was done ruthlessly with the Colliers on several occasions. It is, however, a barbarous method and causes much dislocation. It is also not, completely efficacious, since it is three weeks before it can affect the position in the White Sea, during which time tonnage is wasted.The Russians have already been warned officially that the adequate supply of labour must be assured before tonnage can be provided.

RUSSIA.Military, Trade and Treaty.Decypher.   Sir G. Buchanan (Petrograd), February 23, 1917.D. 9.14 p.m., February 23, 1917.R. 8.0 a.m., February 24, 1917 -No. 219.     (R.)Organisation of North Russian Ports.At a meeting presided over by Lord Milner on February 21, and attended by Admiral Korvin, commanding at Archangel, and British Naval and Military Officers, it was decided that question of labour and other matters regulating import and export of Government stores via Norwegian and Russian ports should be made the subject of formal agreement between the two Governments.As the mission was leaving the same night, Lord Milner decided to entrust final drafting of agreement to Admiral Korvin and two officers of Russian Naval Staff on one side., and General Poole and Commodore Kemp and Counsellor of Embassy on the other.Final draft has full approval of the Minister of Marine and Admiral Korvin, who considers formal agreement necessary to strengthen his hand in dealing with other Government Departments. Russian Chief of General Staff has agreed to supply 11,000 labourers out of 20,000 asked for by Admiral Korvin, who so informed Captain Kemp and Naval Attache this morning. Former is very dissatisfied with this result, but it appears to me not (?un) natural that some pressure should be necessary to secure military labour required.This pressure, if it proves necessary, had better be exercised on Russian Government through Embassy.Lord Milner was most anxious that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not take final objection to this agreement until he has been consulted.Following is the text of Draft Agreement.   Begins :-(1) Munitions.Russian Government undertake to provide military organisation of Active Service Army to deal with all munitions from board ship to ultimate deposit in railway wagon to be officered by Service officers and Russian military officer (grade undecided) who will be directly (? grade omitted) Vice-Admiral Commanding for due performance of work.British Naval Officer from Naval Transport Department to be attached to Officer Commanding organisation.Organisation will also undertake duties of military police for all munitions discharging points, provide sentries for all ships and barges having explosives on board, and generally regulate work under (V omitted rules) of strict military discipline of Army in the Field in war time.Organisation to be furnished with an adequate supply of horses and suitable carts.Where difficulty is found in requisitioning horses and carts locally, these are to be supplemented as necessary from military resources.Organisation to be of sufficient strength to continue work by day and night, and to deal with 600 tons daily from each ship discharging.Detachment of 300 Russian seamen from Imperial Navy or its reserves to be attached to organisation.Duties of those will be to assist with heavy lifts berthing ships, renewing strops and discharging appliances, &amp;c.This number to be reasonably increased or diminished as experience requires. Organisation to be employed solely for work in connexion with general cargo which will be kept apart and distinct from coal.Organisation to be fitted with suitable wet weather clothing.Same to be served out to stevedores employed at their own cost.(2) General cargo work to be independent of public holidays and steps be taken by Russian Government to prevent depletion of stevedores during the harvest time.
(3) Customs tallying staff to be increased-to obviate all delays in this respect.Increase to be on the basis of 600 tons per day from every ship discharging.(4) With reference to above organisation will handle all cargo discharged at any munitions discharging point irrespective of the nature of the &quot;goods or whether they are consigned to firms, Ministries, or Government Departments.   .. -: 1 ;- (2) Coal. -        - &apos;/?&apos;;&apos;   &apos;(a) Due performance of stevedoring work to be under the -supervision,of British Naval Transport Department, both at Archangel and Kem. ;        ,    . .   ., (b) Russian Government to guarantee supply to stevedoring contractors of-the requisite labour, should it be.required. r: &apos;Amount of such labour to be based on an estimate of at least 200 per-ship for every ship discharging.      - ,These may be either active service men or reserve men, but they must be capable of heavy work. ; ..- v     &apos; ; I \(c) Suitable accommodation for all labourers to be provided. Russian Government: to undertake rationing of all labourers supplied by them and to make suitable&apos;-&apos; arrangements for purchase by private labour of the suitable provisions.(e) (sic) Arrangements to be made by Russian Government for supply of wet weather clothing for aU labourers in order that work may proceed irrespective of weather.(/) Arrangements with regard to harvest and holidays to be similar to those made for general cargo.(g) Russian Government to put in hand at once necessary arrangements for con-struction of baskets and wheel barrows and for supply of necessary shovels, cordage, timber, and nails.Supply of all these necessaries to be adequate to needs of the whole season, allowing for wastage.These appliances to be sold or hired to various stevedoring firms at cost price plus 10 per cent.(h) Bunkering of steamers to be carried out by stevedoring firms under the super-vision of British Naval Transport Department.(3) General.(1) Russian Government undertake efficient lighting of all the ships, holds, wharves, barges, and storehouses where special arrangements are necessary.(2) Efficient telephone communication to be provided between Archangel, Bakaritsa, and other points where cargo is being discharged (or embarked).(3) Telephone system to be accessible to all engaged in transport work.(4) First entry of ships into Archangel depends on matters outside human control. It is however necessary that labour should be ready and on the spot and wages paid ready for an early opening of navigation.All contractors to be indemnified against loss on this account. Definite date on which such indemnity ceases to be fixed.by Vice-Admiral Commanding.(5) All tugs to be requisitioned by Russian Government except British Government tugs.(6) In order to ensure continuity of labour all persons connected with Government import and export into and out of the North of Russia shall be exempted from present or future mobilization orders.Vice-Admiral Commanding-in-Chief will decide any cases in dispute. Lists of principal exemptions requested by British firms to be supplied to Vice-Admiral as soon as possible.(7) Russian Government undertakes to provide barges and tugs to deal with Government imports and exports and harbour service in all ports in North Russia where import and export is in progress.Number of such barges and tugs to be sufficient to ensure that delays from lack, of these craft shall not arise.British Admiralty will co-operate to extent of its resources in supplying above and definitely agrees to send to Kussia barges equal in number and capacity to those lost on the way or detained in England owing to late season in 1916.b 4
(8) Russian Government undertakes to reserve the following;berths at Archangel for exclusive export of wheat:- 1;&apos;; Six at station,- :. Four on the right bank (immediately above Smolny Bugan) and. berth for steamers loading from barges as required.Russian Government undertakes that all berths so reserved shall be properly equipped with everything necessary for rapid and efficient loading of steamers. It is understood that export of wheat, flax, and other Government cargoes will be carried out by private labour if possible, but should available private labour be insufficient to meet these requirements Russian authorities undertake to supplement it as necessary by public labour.(9) Russian Government undertakes to supply all necessary facilities for rapid and efficient discharge and loading of barges at Kotlass.(10) British Government agree to provide a selected propelling 100-tons crane at Archangel as soon as possible after opening navigation.(11) Whole work of port so far as it is effected by above agreement shall be under general control of Vice-Admiral Commanding, who will have a deciding voice as questions arise.
