22,IMPERIAL, WAB,.CABIIE?T.Enlistment of United States Citizens:in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.Note by the Secretary of State for War.The letter written &quot;by Sir George Perley to the Secretary . ef the War Cabinet (G.T.421) has been referred to the Judge Advocate General who has expressed the follfcwing views&quot;Having regard to the provision of Section 80 (4) (a) and (b) *f the Army Act I am of opinion that enlistment as a soldier of the regular forces is not complete until the oath of allegiance has been taken.     But if a man receives pay as a soldier in any corps of the regular forces he is deemed for all purposes to be a soldier of the regular forces and is subject to military law although.he has not been duly enlisted by virtue of Section 100 (2) of the Army Act.     In that case he may however claim his discharge at any time but remains subject to military law until actually discharged.With regard to the Canadian Militia I would call attention to Section 28 of the Canadian Militia and Defence Act&quot;,,The relevant portions of the Army Act and the Canadian Militia and Defence are subjoined.80 (4), If he assents to be enlisted -(a)    The justice, after cautioning such person that if he makes any false answer to the questions read to him he will be liable to be punished as provided by this Act, shall read or cause to -nae read to him the questions set forth in the attestation paper for the time being authorised by the Army&quot; Council and shall take care that such person understands each question so read, and after ascertaining that the answer of such person to each question hasbeen
boon duly recorded opposite the same in the attestation paper.-shall require him to make and sign the declaration as to the truth of those answers set forth in the said paper, and shall then administer to him the oath of allegiance contained in the said paper:(b)   Upon signing the declaration and taking the oath, suchperson shall he deemed to&apos;be&apos; enlisted as a soldier of HisMajesty&apos;s regular forces.;*        *        *        *        *        *100 (2).   ^There a person is in pay as a soldier in any corps of His Majesty&apos;s regular forces, such person shall be deemed for all the purposes of this Act to be a soldier of the regular forces, with this qualification, that he may at any time claim his discharge, but until he so claims and is discharged in pursuance of that claim he ^shall be subject to this Act as a soldier of the regular forces legally enlisted and duly attested under this Act.23.  (l).    The following oath shall be tahen and subscribed before one of such commissioned officers of the Militia as are authorized for that purpose by any general order or by regulation; or before a Justice of the Peace, by every person upon., engaging to serve in the Active Militia.&quot;I/.A.B. do sincerely promise and swea,r that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty&quot;, (2)   Such oath.shall have the effect of a.written engagement with the King binding the person subscribing&apos; it to serve in the Militia until he is legally dischargedj dismissed, or removed or until his resignation is accepted.DERBY,13.4.17.
