Confidential.Printed for the Use of the Reconstruction Committee.RECONSTRUCTION COMMITTEE.MLlQ^r    German Post-War Economic Policy.Ill-THE BEARING OF AMERICAN INTERVENTION UPON GERMANPOST-WAR ^ECONOMIC PLANS.The intervention of the United States has an important bearing on German post-war economic plans, both for the transition period after the conclusion of hostilities and in the more distant future.   In estimating the considerations which weighed with Germany&apos;s rulers in embarking upon &quot;unrestricted&quot; submarine warfare calculations as to its possible influence on the post-war economic situation must not be overlooked ; and there can be no doubt that those calculations weighed against the new policy, but were outweighed by other more potent arguments.   There is indeed some reason to believe that post-war economic conditions have hitherto exerted a powerful influence in restraining Germany&apos;s rulers from provoking the United States to extremes.   It was recently stated in the Times (February 3, 1917) on what appears to be good authority that Dr. Helfferich, who is the controlling mind behind Germany&apos;s post-war preparations, had been the chief influence in dissuading the supreme authority from pushing the &quot; Sussex &quot; controversy to the breaking-point. The recent manifesto of the Prussian Minister of War, General von Stein, seems to contain a veiled allusion to the controversy between those who thought only, in terms of military advantage and those who framepl their policy with a view to more distant consequences.   &quot; Of what avail,&quot; asked the General,&quot; are the best preparations for the &quot; period after the war if before that we are destroyed ?   .   .   .   Thoughts of peace &quot; must be set in the background. &quot;*The intervention of the United States would seem to affect German economic plans for the transition period in four directions : (1) Provision of foodstuffs and raw material. (2) Shipping. (3) Credit. (4) Markets.1. It is universally admitted by German (indeed also by Austrian) writers that the close of hostilities will find those countries practically denuded not only of foodstuffs, but also of industrial raw material.The problem of rapidly restocking the country with industrial raw material is vital to Germany&apos;s future prosperity; for she cannot begin to export till she has replenished her own supplies, and every day that her exports are delayed in making their appearance in foreign markets is a day gained by her neutral and enemy competitors. The importance of this question has been fully recognised by the German Government, which has appointed a special Department to deal with it, under the control of an official known as &quot; The Imperial Commissioner for the Transition from War to Peace Economy.&quot; This Department, which is attached to the Ministry of the Interior, presided over by Dr. Helfferich, has power to &quot;take over&quot; any commodity the control of which it can satisfy the Ministry of the Interior to &quot;be expedient and to obtain all trade information which it requires to make that control effective. It is expressly authorised to organise purchase on behalf of the State, either through companies already existing or by the formation of new ones. No information is available as to what commodities it is proposed to take over in this way, but it is already clear that control will extend at least to all important foodstuffs and raw materials.!   It may, therefore, be assumed that purchases. of raw material* London evening papers, February 5th, 1917., f Dr.-Michaelis, Director of the Imperial Corn Office, has recently pointed out in a public lecture that the State, control of corn is certain to continue, after the war. As regards the control of raw materials, see Daily Notes for March 13th, 1914, quoted in Part II. of these reports.* (35)2656-2 .Wt 61481-51   125   3/17   E &amp; S
made in recent months by German agents for delivery after the war are made on behalf of the Imperial Commissioner^ Department; and further, that the Department has cognisance of and intends in due time to take over all stocks of raw material accumulated by private firms previous to its establishment.The amount of * raw material bought and stocked in this way in the United States on post-war account is impossible to estimate. The principal articles con-cerned are Cotton, Copper, and Wool, the three most important industrial raw materials of which Germany is in need.The War Office (Raw Materials Section) memorandum, dated June last, under the heading &quot;Forward Purchases,&quot; gave the following particulars as to German holdings of these commodities in the United States : Cotton. Preparations are being made by German importers for meeting the demand for cotton; the German steamers lying in the ports of the United States are being loaded up, and arrangements are being made for those in Central America to sail to North American ports to collect their cargoes. Indications exist that cotton is being accumulated for German account at New York, New Orleans, Houston, Galveston, Tupelo (Miss.), and Brownsville (Tennessee), the amount of these holdings being estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 bales.Copper. A New York firm has German contracts for the post-bellum delivery of 4,500 tons of copper. A German ship has been chartered to carry 2,500 tons of copper from New York to-Hamburg on the conclusion of hostilities. . . American banks are being requested to have enough copper warehoused for German account. But the most interesting indication is the announcement of the formation of a State-aided limited liability company to provide copper for German industries after the war. ,,Wool. Wool is being loaded on interned steamers at Buenos Aires. When these are full the vessels at New &quot;York are to be used for the same purpose, the Hamburg-Amerika line having arranged an inclusive charge of 50 marks per ton for warehousing until the end of the war.Further information as regards American eotton is supplied by an article in the Ruropdisehe Staats und Wirtschaftszeitung for August 13th, 1916, which states that on August 31st, 1915, a cotton-import company was founded with Government help (Mitwirkung) at Bremen, and that on the day of its establishment it bought a million bales in America.With regard to copper,, the War Trade Intelligence Department Memorandum on German Purchases, quoting from a French report dated 13th March 1916, states that a trust has been formed to provide for the supply of copper after the war. This trust was originally not a Government agency, but would undoubtedly fall within the purview of the Imperial.Commissioners&apos; arrangements^ The memorandum.gives the following table&apos; of stocks of copper known to be accumulated for post-war shipment on German ships in United States ports : Steamship.

Full cargo, copper and cotton. 1,500 tons. 1,500 tons. 2,000/tons. 2,500 tons, copper and other goods.It has also been reported in the German press that the German Government some &apos; time ago ordered 100 million marks&apos; worth of copper oh post-bellum account.-1 No information seems to be available as to Germ an forward purchases of foodstuffs, but the German Government must be well aware that to re-stock the country will take at the best some considerable time, and that the point of exhaustion must therefore be antedated by some months. It is obvious that this vital factor in their calculations will be adversely affected by the hostility of the United States, which is likely, .owing
to transport and other difficulties in Russia, to be the nearest available large source&apos; of supply. The United States would naturally join with the Allies in allocating the disposal of foodstuffs, and even if they did not do so they would naturally wish to allocate their supplies to Belgium arid Poland. . It is not, however, likely that the German Government will make forward purchases of foodstuffs till after the next harvest north of the line.2. Shipping-Shipping is, of course, a vital element in Germany&apos;s post-war plans. According to Lloydslist the total German shipping in United States ports amounts to 623,000 tons, worth about-19,000,000Z.:i:&quot;Germany&apos;s total mercantile shipping is estimated in Lloyds Register for 1916 at 3 890,000 tons. Germany would therefore appear to be jeopardising one-sixth of her mercantile marine. There is, however, another side to this question. The Germaa Government has during 1916 been pursuing a vigorous shipbuilding policy, and has devoted special grants of money and labour to that purpose. A War Trade Intelligence Department memorandum, dated September 22nd, 1916, estimates after a careful review of the available evidence, that ships amounting to 110,000 tons in all were completed in January-June .1916, and that ships amounting to 900,000 were building at that time. Moreover, there is considerable difference of opinion as to the extent of Germany&apos;s need for tonnage -after the war. In an article contributed to the Christmas number of the Neue Freie Presse; Dr. Ballin, Chairman of the Hamburg-America Line, remarks:- &apos;&quot; In my view, which differs from the generally accepted one, the tonnage question is only of secondary importance in the period of transition. If, as we may definitely assume, peace opens the door once more to, the free, play of economic forces, the supply of tonnage for world transport will, after a few months, exceed the demand. For the workTs commerce will be severely diminished over a long period by restricted export, high freights, dear raw materials and foodstuffs, and exchange difficulties. The shipping question is therefore far less important than the degree to which it will be necessary to restrict imports owing to the position of the exchanges, together with a number of other factors.&quot;It will be observed that Dr. Ballin apparently takes for granted the free restoration to German use of the German ships in enemy as well as neutral harbours ; also that his views in the shrinkage of demand do not hold good for the first critical; months after the conclusion of hostilities, during which the ships interned in American harbours were intended to be especially useful. We may therefore conclude that, however Germany may be prepared to cope with the general post-war shipping problem and how she does so will depend, of course, on the terms of peace the endangering of the use of the ships in American harbours runs contrary to her carefully designed plans of economic reconstruction.3. Credit. The end of the war will find Germany in a position of great financial stress. It is impossible at the present state of the war to form any exact estimate of her position in this regard.A moderate German authority! writing in August 1916, when there was still some expectation in such circles that Germany might secure indemnities, states that Germany would find herself in greater need of productive capital than any of the belligerents, and summarises her needs, in this..regard as follows : (1) Capital for the re-stocking of the country with raw material.(2) Capital,to convert war industries back to peace uses.(3) Capital to level up productive plant all round on the basis of the improvementsmade in various quarters during the war. (4) Capital to replace productive capital which, lying unused during war time,has been invested in war loan. ,(5) Capital for public (state, municipal and communal) objects left over till theend of the war. (6) Capital for Colonial and Turkish development.* Estimated by Mr. D. E. W. Gibb, of Lloyds, in the Daily Chronicle, February 9th, 1917. The estimate in. Fair Play (February 8th, 1917) is 686.608 (U.S.A., 553,689; Philippines, 87,896 ; Hawaii, 35,023). *f Professor Mombert, of Freiburg, in thfe Europdische IStaats und WirtschaftsZeitunq, August 18th, 1916. -        * A
* Syren and Shipping for February 9th, 1917, gives a list of 15 high-class German securities, including Reichsbank shares, which are being offered for sale in neutral countries and by wireless in the United States. \. .There are, continues this writer, only three ways in which this situation can be met, the exchange situation eased, and the country set once more on a productive basis: (1) The export of gold. This is ruled out owing to the state of the gold reserve. (2) The raising of a foreign loan.(3) The sale of German securities, primarily war loan, in foreign countries.The writer favours the last-named expedient as being more elastic and more easily adapted to the state of the exchange at any given moment, and there is good evidence that it has been found necessary to adopt it already, before the conclusion of hostilities.8&apos;The importance of maintaining good relations with the public of the United States in connection with these financial measures is manifest. If German war loan stock is to find a foreign market anywhere it will be in the United States; and to endanger or even cloud with uncertainty the relations between the two countries renders the task of those who have the work of preparing for Germany&apos;s financial recuperation almost inconceivably difficult. The great object aimed at in German reconstruction plans has been to get the productive enterprise of the country on to a sound basis, whether by indemnities or other help from abroad, before the imposition of the inevitable heavy taxation necessary to pay the war loan interest. The chances of being able to do this would seem now to be greatly diminished.4. Markets. It is common knowledge that Germany has been much disturbed by the Paris Conference Resolutions and that her most obvious line of escape lay in cultivating the American market. The bearings of American intervention upon the problem which the Paris Conference Resolutions were designed to meet demand separate consideration. But it is not easy to over-estimate the effect on the post-war situation of a state of feeling which may partially close the greatest of neutral markets to German trade. German exports to the United States of America amounted in 1913 to 713 million marks, or 7 * 1 per cent, of the total German export trade.The two chief articles are chemicals, including dyes, to the value of 70 million marks, and toys to the value of 32. Steps are already being taken in the United States, as in this country, to reduce the dependence of the textile industry upon German dyes, and the project will undoubtedly now be pushed forward.
