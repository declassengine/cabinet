SECRET. G.T.. 413.WAR -CABINET .&quot;Limitation of Shipping Profits.&apos;&apos; Note by Board of Inland Revenue on Memorandum of Shipping Controller.We have nothing to urge against this- memorandum which on the contrary appears to us to indicate the right legisla-tive and administrative measures for giving effect to the decisions of the War Cabinet as stated in the first paragraph.It should perhaps be pointed cut that an incidental effect of the ddcision to make requisition universal or nearly uni-versal will be an immense reduction in the sum which would otherwise have been received as Excess Profits Duty.   This &quot;re-duction will be only partially felt in the current financial year.The scheme for the limitation sf shipping profits would require legislation for which the forthcoming Einance Bill would afford an opportunity.-&apos; This legislation (in the fram-ing of which consultation between this Board and the Ministry of Shipping would be necessary)  should not prove either vol-uminous or, - when once the principle of the scheme is accepted - controversial in its details. vThe working of the scheme (in consultation with the Min-.1stry of Shipping) vail throw upon the Inland Revenue organis-ation an additional strain the extent of which depends in a marked degree.upon the question whether a special Shipping Standard is decided upon and if so upon the number of pre-war years taken as the basis of that standard.   We believe, however, that, subject to a close adherence in the details of the scheme to the general-body of Excess Profits Duty law -which is v/ell adapted to the object in view - the additional work can be successfully carried out.We are in the fullest agreement with the view expressed in the memorandum that the scheme should be operated by our machinery as an addition to the Excess Profits Duty.(Sgd)    C.E.N0TT- BOWER. . &quot; WARREK FISHER.Board of Inland Revenue.
