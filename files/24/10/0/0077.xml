S.....EC HE J;.G.1./9 5/274.COPY NOEECES3ITY FOR THE RESUMPTION OF COjmTROE OVER OUR OW FORCES,lf      I have many times suggested during the. last fourteen months the desirability of our acquiring a greater share both in the diplomatic and in the military conduct, of the war.    I am of opinion that the necessity for greater military control is now more necessary than ever because of the collapse of Russia,  the shipping situation, the declining strength of the French military forces,  and the instability of the French Government-.    We entered the&apos;war with a very small Army and as a military auxiliary to France,  and notwithstanding the fact that we have since become the principal opponent of the Central Aov/ers and the financial, naval, and,, to a.great extent, the military mainstay of the Entente,, we are still playing a subordinate role to France as far as military operations are concerned.2.      The unstable nature of the French Government tends, among other things, to serious vacillation in the conduct, of military operations,  and as an example of this I may state that it has been reported to mo by our liaison officers&apos; with the French Armies that on the 5th instant -after we had commenced our artillery bombardment in the offensive operations which&apos; were proposed by the French Government and agreed-to by the war Cabinet - a Conference was held at Compiegne with the object of-considering the desirability of not undertaking these&apos; operations. lit. Poincare, the French war ; Cabinet, General Hi veil e,-and the Army Group Commanders attended the Conference.&apos; It &quot;may be- argued that/- this action on&apos;&apos; the part of the French . - - Governmen&apos;
m-- 328Government was due to a difference of opinion between the French Military Commanders, but the French Government ought not to have countenanced any such difference once they had definitely accepted the plan, as they did, which General Nivelle had put forward.    I am informed that their reason for thinking that the operations as originally planned should not take place was that America having joined in the war a new situation, had been created, that the Allies could now last out indefinitely, that a reduced offensive might be contemplated, and that a French army should be maintained intaot to meet eventualities.   Apparently General Hivelle would not agree to this and said it must be either all lor&quot; nothing,  and General Micheler took the same view.    The impression in France is that if the operations do not prove, successful General iliyelle will be dismissed from his Command.. wgfA&amp;^lAAA^lSi5c   I do not wish to refer to,the reasons which influen-ced His Majesty&apos;s Government in placing .the British Armies in France under the orders of General IT i veil e, but I do urge the necessity of the French taking back the duty of holding more of their front., and of our re-assuming full control over our troops as soon as this-can be done.    The great, extension of our Front, which formed part of the ITivelle&apos; plan, has left us with an inadequate reserve. .of well -trained divisions to meet eventualities, not only in Franoe but elsewhere, and this is the more serious because of the German reinforcements which may be set free from the Russian front.   The Germans already have great reserve ,forces which they could fling against one of the existing fronts or in some new direction for example, In Italy or Asiatic Turkey   -    and we have no adequate reserve to meet such a diversion; We also have to consider the vital necessity of clearing the Belgian Coast before the winter.
-. 00&apos;-i:M 3 *        ; . A; y;/:4.    In the present operations Cambrai is our objective, and -whether successful or not they will provide an opport-unity for reverting to the system in vogue before the Calais Conference.    I trust therefore that the War Cabinet will, ?-rhen the time comes, take advantage of this opportunity so that we may acquire the reserves we need, and no longer be subordinate to a Government which is neither stable nor far-sighted and which not unnaturally has an eye to French rather than to British interests.    Our object is net primarily the&apos; direct defence of French soil, but to win the war and secure British interests.5.    I do not suggest any immediate action, as this might create unnecessary friction and merely do more harm than good to the Allied cause.    My object is to place my views now before the War Cabinet soathat they may have time to consider them,  as the French may any day surprise us with another of their bcmb-shell proposals, which will certainly entail a continuance and probably an extension of our subordination to French military control,17/4/17.W.
