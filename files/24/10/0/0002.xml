War CabinetPrecis of a Report by Colonel Hunter, Army Medical Service, President of the Mediterranean Sanitary Commission, on Malaria in Macedonia.Circulated by the Secretary of State&apos; for War.Under date 4th March, 1917, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Salonika Force, forwards a report by Colonel Hunter, A.M.S., President of the Advisory Committee on Epidemic Diseases, regarding the future prospects of Malaria in Macedonia.General Milne states that the only solution for avoiding some of the worst districts such as the VARDAR VALLEY is a successful advance.Colonel Hunter visited the areas of the 10th, 27th and 28th Divisions and the villages of KUKULUK, and EL ISMon the far side of the STRUMA.He reports that it is the experience of all the Forces concerned that Malarial infection, which has long been known to be endemic in the Macedonian area, and has played an important role in causing depopulation, has been proved by the experience of the epidemic of the past year to be far greater both in magnitude and severity than was ever before recognised.It is particularly intense in the STRUMA Valley, and the VARDAR and ARDZAN areas, but it extends everywhere although in less degree down to the SALONIKA base.During the past year it affected more than one fourth of the total forces.The malarial infection has therefore been not only of unusual magnitude, but also of exceptional intensity, as shoirn by the severity of its clinical features, the post-mortem changes found in fatal cases, debilitating effects, and subsequent frequency of relapses.These relapses are so frequent at the present time (February 1917) that they are estimated to constitute(a) three-fourths or more of the present sick rate in some of the Regimental Aid Posts (e.g., 125 cases in one Battalion in the past 7 weeks);(b) tYvo-thirds or more of the admissions into the Field Ambulances (eg., 3,000 out of 4,500 cases admitted to the three Field Ambulances of the 16th Corps in 7 weeks);These proportions denote the existance of a high degree of malarial infection, a correspondingly large number of malarial &quot;carriers&quot; among the troops, especially in the STRUMA Valley, and a correspondingly large increase in the sources of -malarial infection through mosquitoes during the coming year&apos;.Having regard to the well-known long persistence (up to two years or longer) of malarial infections in the body, it may be taken as probable that a very large proportion of the troops affected last year are potential &quot;carriers&quot;, that is, potential sourGe&apos;s of infection during the coming year.In
In view of these facts, especially the frequency of relapses at the present, time as also the occurrence of primary cases (e.g., 287 primary cases out of 1,009 cases reported during the five weeks ending loth January to 10th February,  as compared with a total of nine cases during January and February of last year, and a total of 27 3 cases during the first six months of 1916), the prospect for the corning year is that the malarial infection will be even greater than it was last year if the troops continue to occupy their present positions.The measures already tak -n and being taken include provision for a general control of the whole malarial work by Commissioners specially appointed for this purpose, a supply of mosquito netting for bivouacs on a scale never previously attempts modification in -clothing, quinine prophylaxis,  etc.Colonel Hunter considers it import that :-,      All the anti-malarial measures adopted should extend to the base area, the individual camps, hospitals and their immediate surroundings,  as well as to the more obviously dangerous areas, of which the chief are those on the MCHASTIH Road, viz the marshes near the village of DUDULAR, and higher up the hill near DAUTBALI,  and JBHIJOJ Villages.The arrangements already made provide for dealing with the latter (by canalisation and draining) in the manner which proved in a high degree effective in the case of the marshes adjacent which were drained last year.The evidence shows that malarial infection (although relatively small, nevertheless considerable in amount) prevails throughout the whole Salonika Base area, even in situations where the conditions seem as favourable as they could possibly be, viz;-on the hillside away from any obvious source of infection.A report shows that in the 10th Division quinine controlled in a striking manner the-recrudescence of malaria, in those already infected.In tws weeks during which administration of quinine was suspended in the Division the number of admissions into its Field Ambulances arose from previous- figures of 150 and 170 to figures of 370 and 340, and fell again at once on its resumption.During the past year the infection has been intense and the dose in most cases excessive (conveyed as it has often been not by occasional bites of a single mosquito, but multiple biles from many infected mosquito .-s),X&apos;o this circumstance must be ascribed some part of the ineffective&quot; and disappointing results obtained by quinine prophylaxis.Ho amount of quinine can protect against such over-whelming doses of infection.Prophylactic quinine may however serve to protect-again st smaller closes of infection,  or modify the effects of larger doses, and is therefore, rightly, being continued this season.The
The measures to he taken may serve to lessen and control the amount of malarial infection; hut, in view of the natural conditions, the massive amount of that infection and the prevalence of infected mosquitoes,  the invalidity during the coming year will probably be as great as it vvas last year. On estimate it may extend to one-half to three-fourths of the entire Force.In these circumstances it will be extremely advisable, if military considerations permit,  that any operations to be undertaken should enable the troops to get out of the most malarious districts by the end of May.After that period there is -certain to be a large recrudescence of malaria, and a repetition of the experiences of last year.DERBY..The War Office,10th April,  1917..
