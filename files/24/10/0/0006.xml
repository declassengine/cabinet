S -E C -R EJLi G.T.. 406.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON THE GENERAL SITUATION IN ROUMANIA.By Major J. P. NEILSON, 10th Royal Hussars. 24th February, 1917.COMMUNICATIONS.These are bad beyond all belief.    Roumanian railways must be experienced to be believed.   I have long cursed Russian rail-ways, but now they seem to me the acme of comfort and regularity. The present state of chaos in Roumania has never been equalled. Today there is dual control, Roumanian and Russian.   Complete Rumanian control produced little save almost daily accident?, Dual control has perhaps slightly reduced the number of accidents, but nothing more.   Under the present arrangement a board of Russian engineers &quot;advises&quot; the Roumanian authorities, while the latter control and run the railways.   The Russians have only the power to &quot;request&quot; not fee &quot;order&quot;.   I can quote a reliable instance of the sphere of usefulness of a Russian board of advisers.   The senier General of the Russian board of advisers to the Rumania artillery told me that he had the strict-est orders in no way to hurt the Rumanians&apos; feelings, he was only to &quot;suggest&quot; that this and that was done,  otherwise in the Russian artillery, and perhaps it might be worth while to give their system a trial..   He was on   no account to say that this was bad, and that wrong.A more light hearted officer painted an amusing picture of an adipose and perspiring Rumanian officer perched on a gun limber watching through his glasses the effect of his fire, while by his side a trumpeter trumpeted his orders:-As a matter of fact they say the Rumanian artilleryfire was very accurate,  but their methods more closelyresembled A.D. 1800 than 1917.
illie reason of the delay   the stationmasterWith Rumanians&apos;hate -and distrust of Russia, one has no reason to suppose that The Board of Russian Railway Advisers does more than respectfully &quot;suggest&quot;, and it is even more certain that the Rumanian Authorities do no more than respect-fully pay no attention whatsoever.   The net results are that the minimum number of trains run with the maximum amount of delay.As things are at present, the&apos;: railways are incapable of supplying the armies,  in consequence of this the Russian armies, are faced with atarvation or a retirement into Russia.The Rumanians have conclusively proved themselves either incapable, or unwilling,  to manage their railways. Russia is unable to find the necessary number of men to actually run the railways. (I am told that 10,000 officials are required to do this).My suggestion of putting an Englishman at the head of the railways with absolute powers, has been found&apos; undesirable from a political point of view.   The only hope of putting the railways in a working condition is to place them entirely in Russian hands.If this is left to the Russians it will take many weeks to even appoint a Controller, who will take many weeks to find out the surest way to make the maximum profit out of his appointment.   By this time the crisis will have passed; i.e. the Russians will have left Rumania.One man,  of energy, determination, and unimpeachable honesty must be chosen; and he must choose his own staff.   He will require a large staff however.   However punctually.trains may leave the various termini, they will be delayed at every wayside station.   At present every train leaves, from 5 to 12 hours late,  and may stand from 30 min. to 6 hours at any one station,  or at all stations.    This is done without any apparent reason.   I know of an authentic case of a train feeing stopped by signal outside a wayside station.    Three trucks blocked the line.    On being asked th*
announced *that these trucks were waiting to he attached to thetrain from &quot;___&quot;When will that train arrive?&quot;    &quot;Tomorrow&quot;Engines are started off with insufficient fuel or water, the train stops between stations,  the engine returns to replenish and the train blocks the line.   Fuel is not obtainable at every station, and usually the line is blocked for many hours.However energetic, efficient, and honest the Russian &apos;official in charge may be, he will achieve nothing unless he has a staff of absolutely trustworthy men.   Every Roumanian on the line will continue to do all in his power to delay the.work.The only influence which will force the Roumanians to pass trains without unnecessary delay is fear.   Fear inspired by the example of a number of station masters hanging ouside their own office.   This&quot;is no exaggeration.   Roumanians have an impervious hide,  vulnerable only to wounds which effect their pleasures.   They lack all proper pride and self respect..     Russians assure me, and they understand such matters,  that you can insult a Rumanian as much as you please, and he will bob up again smiling, for certain. You cannot get work out of them by appealing to any higher feelings -They work only when forced to.As a nation they are incorrigibly idle, imperturbably idle. Time does not exist for them,  save as to approximately fix a beginning and an end. to their pleasures.    These, incidentally, are of two kinds only.   Pleasures of.stomach, and pleasures of sex.Even the day of arrival of some train&apos;with supplies is always uncertain, and the hour is unknown up to the very end.   It often, happens that the train is held up at the last station for 12 hours.Roumanians certainly hatje the appearance of being quite incapable of working.    I have had some experience of Russia, but Roumania is much more corrupt in every way.   Each and every station master in Rumania,  like an automatic chocolate machine,
requires a penny in the slot in order to produce movement.   Even taking this into consideration, can the entire Nation he so &quot;bereft of reason as to fail to grasp the importance of supplying the Army which defends the last corner of their country. Roumania did not wish war,   Rumania had been systematically brought up to hate Russia.   Railway officials in particular had been taught to look to Germany for culture and advancement, and-the railways themselves had been completely Germanized.Judging from what I have seen,  and from what I have been told I am firmly convinced that the present derangement of traffic and general delay to all military preparations is intentional.In this lies the chief difficulty for the Russian official in charge of the railways.   Assuming that the Rumanian Government accepts him, he will meet with difficulties and obstacles at every turn.   Everything that can go wrong with a train will go wrong.   He may start his trains in time, but nothing but the fear of death in its most concrete form will make local station masters pass trains without delay.This may all sound rather like &quot;the adventures of Captain Kettle&quot;, but the one man in all the fields of fact and fiction who be ideal in this post is &quot;Captain Kettle&quot;.    The case is urgent,  and time will not allow of consultations and drawing up of plans.   The railways must be made to work within a week.   This is not impossible.At present a railv^ay expert is not required, but a man of iron will and tireless energy.    If the line is cleared, and the Rumanian officials forced to work, that is all that is necessary at the moment.   When that has been done the railway expert can step in.I do not know how serious the question of fuel is,  but I cannot believe it is impossible to arrange.On all main stations in Moldavia there are Russian
Commandants who nominally work in conjunction with the corresponding Rumanian official.   Up to a month ago there were only eight Russian Commandants, hut now the number has been increased.   Many of them speak Rumanian, a number do not.   The Rumanian Commandants do nothing to help.    These representatives of law and order are extremely excitable,  inordinately vain, lazy and incapable.   The Russians are at any rate triers, and his self esteem has been so raised by meeting a nation excelling himself in all his own shortcomings,  that for the time being at any rate, he has forgotten he was lazy,  and works with a wi11.Within the immediate zone of the armies the railways are worked by the Russian railway battalions, but there are still Rumanian ,station masters.Every&apos; station is blocked by perfectly useless wagons. I am told there are 15,000 wagons .in Moldavia,  and only 8000 can possibly be used.   Up to date nothing has been done to clear the line, it is only with the greatest difficulty that any manoeuvring of trains can be done.    The number of trains daily passing through Berlad varies from 2 to 5,    It is possible to run 16.Rumanians,  in their natural state,  do not work at night or on holidays,  only under pressure do they change their habitsWhen I came from Russia I travelled from Razdelnia to Jassy,  a distance of 220 versts, at the rate of 7 versts per hour.   No train overtook mine on the way.   The chief delay is between Ungeni and Jassy,  although. Russian gauge is laid as far as the last named.   On my return to Russia my train was timed to start at 1 A.M. in reality we left at 2 P.M. the following day,  and reached Ungeni in 5 hours.    Going from Jassy to Berlad my train started 12 hours late,  and did the 120 versts in 9 hours.From Berlad to Tekuch my train started 6 hours late
aM covered the45 versts in 14 hours.   There were certainly snowdrifts on the line, hut little was done to overcome the difficulties.   The next train after mine did the journey in 48 hours.Jassy station presents a picture beyond human powers of description.   Day and night it is packed with a seething crowd.   Only by force can you even get in at the door. Roumanian officers, painted, powered and corseted.   Roumanian soldiers partly in ragged uniforms, partly in peasants clothes. All hungry and dejected.   A.large number of Russian officers and soldiers vainly trying .to rejoin their regiments, and an even larger number of very dirty soldiers successfully trying to reach Russia and a peaceful life.Usually about 12 hours late a train arrives.    It is guarded by a solid line of Rumanian gendarmes with fixed bay-onets, who are immediately swept aside and engulfed in the battle for seats.   Those favoured by fortune are packed into windowless carriages or stand in the corridor and on the steps. The less lucky majority return to the platform and await the next day*s train.The Commandant told me that 50 Praporshchika had waited 4 days and been unable to get into any train.Every one knows what should be done, but no one is capable of doing what is necessary.   Numerous Commissions have sat, but beyond making suggestions, have evolved nothing tangible.   The proposal is to build the following lines, but nothing definite has been done at present.    Join the Berlad-Galatz line to the Banderi-Reni line by a branch running across the Prut North of Lake Bratish.Join Berlad to Kishenev via Khush.Double the line Jassy - Tekuch.In addition to the above a narrow gauge line has been begun from the Benderi - Reni line to Berlad so as to link up
Akkerman line with the line Jassy - Tekush and Jassy - Galatz.The line Bolzi - Jassy is under construction. At Nikolina on the Jassy - Ungeni line is being made a large sorting station,  consisting of at least 9-12 sets of rails.The Reni - Galatz branch is under fire from two enemy batteries south of Galatz.   On Feb. 15th this line was broken in five places by floods.   At the same time all crossings over the Prut south of Mastakani were impassable,  so that supplying the IV Siberian Corps was extremely difficult.The Benderi - Reni line works very badly.   It was built very hurriedly in 177 and since that time has been considered of no importance strategically or commercially.    The grades and curves are such that three engines are necessary in many places.The western line&apos; Tekuch - Galatz is not working much further than Iveshti.The line Kishenev - Ungeni.   The actual track is double but Tails have not been laid.    I was told this by an engineer and I think that in a few places in the hills west of Ungeni the track is still single.-  The railways are incapable of traaaporting sufficient fresh men to replace casualties.The railways are incapable of supplying, the armies.They are working as badly today as when the armies first took Up the line of the Seret and Putna.Nothing is being done to improve matters.Roumanians officials put every obstacle in tthe wajr of improvements.^t is impossible that any nation can be so utterly incapable as the Roumanians appear to be.
I am convinced that the Rumanians intentionally   prevent any improvement.My views are shared by all Russian officers who are most capable of judging.If the management of the railways is not immediately taken out of the hands of the Rumanians the Russian armies in Rumania will starve. 2. GENERAL SITUATION IN RUMANIA.The Russian Armies in Rumania are fighting under most difficult conditions.   The railways are incapable of supplying the troops.   Local supplies have hitherto beenentirely relied on. By the 10th March approximately these supplies will be exhausted. By the 15th Feb. the Roumanian authorities had forbidden the further sale of grain to the Russians.    I had to leave the Front shortly af;ter this,  so am unable to state what steps were taken. A3 no&apos;other supplies were available, we may assume they were forced to requisition.Meat was already scarce by the 15th Feb. as cattle were dying from lack of hay. - Sheep were- still plentiful.   The men had sufficient to eat.   Their.diet consisted of meat &quot;souPt beans and maize..   The men hate the gruel made of these grains, and ofter go without rather than eat it.   The health of the troops is bad.   When I left the army the thaw had not properly set in, and the winter had been more severe than had been seen for ten years.    In spite of this,  cholera was spreading in the 4th Army. Typhoid was already raging, and daily increasing with alarming rapidity.   Severe influenza was playing havoc.   In the 6th Army I heard of no cholera, typhoid was not so severe, but scurvy had begun,  caused by lack of vegetables and fats.The typhoid in question is called &apos;recurring typhoid1 by the Russians.    It is seldom fatal, but may come and go during a period of three or four months.
9- 32In spring there is hound to he a most serious epidemicof typhoid and also cholera.Hospitals are inadequate even to deal with the presentnumber of wounded and sick.Doctors, orderlies, hospital appliances and stores are very scarce.    &quot;in the hospitals in Tekuch, for instance, there is a very great shortage of lint and cotton wool and all medicines are very scarce.Russians never take sanitary precautions and the men are unbelievably dirty in their habits, so that nothing can prevent an epidemic and when it comes there will be no means of combating it.From 2% to 7$% of the men are practically speaking; bootless.     That is to say their boots are tied together with string and old bits of cloth.     Regiments vary very much in this. I heard of a case when a regiment refused to leave the trenches on being relieved.     They said they could sit still in the trenches with their boots in their oresent state, but if they started toAllwalk they would/fall to pieces.     Recent issues of boots were of bad quality and the men during the wet weather, burned them in their, efforts to dry them,.Consignments of boots, ordered by all Commanding Officers, from Army Commanders to Regimental Commanders, are lying on the Russian side of the Frontier, and cannot be brought further.    In many cases the boots have been lying over six weeks.There is absolutely no fresh under-linen to issue to the troops, and there is no soap in Roumania to wash what the men already have.The 4th &quot;Army has been in Roumania over 2-g- months, and up to date has not received its Engineers, Sanitary Detachments, (Hospitals, etc. etc;), Aeroplanes, Working Battalions, live stock.     These are still on the Western Front.      (This is of course more due to Russian methods than Roumanian).\ /The
-1-0.The local inhabitants even well-to-do people cannot .   obtain the bare necessities of life.     In the Tekuch district,  . sugar, soap, grain (except Indian corn)r, meat, are almost unprocurable.     The people are apparently living on an exclusive diet of maize.Roumanians, like Russians, suffer from dishonest officials.     I cannot say how much of the privations are due to r want, and how much to the fact that supplies are hidden and misappropriated, nothing escapes the eagle eye of the Roumanian official.     After the needs of the allied officials have been satisfied, little remains for the people.   -It will soon be sowing time, and I cannot see the faintest possibility of anything being sown.3. RELATIONS BETWEEN ROUMANIANS AND RUSSIANS.Relations are very bad, and will become worse.     The Russian Armies are on the territory of an Ally who mistrusts them in everything they do.     The Russian inspires no one who knows him with trust, Roumania has had previous experience of his ways. The Russian, on the other hand, has met a people enjoying all his vices and failings to a considerably greater extent than he himself does.     A country even worse governed than his own.     He despises heartily his new ally and feels his own superiority.There are doubtless faults on both sides, but matters have reached such a pitch that it is difficult to see how they can be improved.The Roumanian view is this &quot;The Russians have come and here they will stay&quot;.     They remember &apos;77 and have visions of further aggression.     Their disinclination to allow Russia in any way to control their c-ountry is quite understandable.I feel for the Roumanians, in the abstract;    in the more concrete sense I have not an ounce of sympathy.     I know the/Russians
Russians and Russian officials must be most unpleasant guests.     It is their nature to cringe before power and bully weakness.     Their fantastically dishonest methods will be no novelty to the Roumanians but to be robbed and bullied by a foreign chinovnik is more galling than to suffer this from ones own countrymen.     The Russian Army too, as guests, are far from desirable.     In their own country they rob, rape and wantonly.destroy&quot;without discrimination.    In a foreign country they feel even freer.     Discipline was always weak, today it.is much lowered.      The great majority of. the officers are very young and inexperienced, and are not made of the stuff that commands respect and obedience.     Added to this is the fact that the army is badly supplied and badly clothed.     The Weather is very severe.,    Fire wood and wood for building and entrenching is extreme-ly scarce.     In spite of all this I must say I was struck by the good order of all the villages.     Roumanians lodge a formal complainl for the most trifling damages.     I feel no sympathy for them at all. They do nothing to defend their own country and expect war to pass by -their cottage without breaking a twig.Today we are faced by the following situation.The Russian Armies are faced with starvation, or a retirement from Roumania.Relations between the two nations are such as to preclude the possibility of concessions from the side of Roumania, unless she is forced to grant them.If the railways are put in working order, the situation can,be saved.     The Roumanians have had ample time to improve the railways, and they have not done anything.    In an interview with General Ragosa, the Commander of the 4th Army, he expressed the gravest anxiety regarding the present situation and directly asked for the intervention of the British Government.He laid great stress on the fact that he spoke to me man to man and quite unofficially.     If any steps are.taken, and I most sincerely hope this may be found possible, on no account must/the

I will send an Army to its destructi Not only my Army, but all the Russian Armies in Roumania will be wiped out&quot;.The General has already rendered his appreciation ofthe situation and officially protested against this system of waging war.     This is to safeguard himself against the  - -consequences.     When the crash comes a scapegoat must be foundand those in power will not be scrupulous.     Rather- than see hisArmy perish the General will tender1 his resignation.The Roumanians refuse to do anything to help the Russians.     General Ragosa asks for more hospital accommodation for his sick.     It is refused.     He asks for accommodation for his men. It is refused.     He requires 6 trains a day to supply his Army. The greatest number he has ever received is 2.     And very often none arrive.     He has no working battalions to repair roads, and no material to repair with,     He has no control over the inhabitants in the zone of his Army, and is not allowed to evacuate villages though they lie directly on his line of trenches.Every request to General Sakharov meets v/ith an answer of this kind.     &quot;You must remember that we are more or less guests here.     The Roumanians asked as to come here, we must be careful in our dealings with them.     We must not hurt their feelings&quot;.     And because General Sakharov has not the manhood to insist on getting what concerns the very existence of his Armies, these Armies are faced with an appalling disaster.I do not know to what extent General Sakharov&apos;s hands are tied by Petrograd (or shall we call it Petersburg) diplomacy. Or whether his action, or lack of action,  is the outcome of/inertia&apos; - -

And because General Sakharov has not the manhood to insist on getting what concerns the very existence of his Armies, these Armies are faced with an appalling disaster.I do not know to what extent General Sakharov&apos;s hands are tied by Petrograd (or shall we call it Petersburg) diplomacy. Or whether his action, or lack of action,  is the outcome of/inertia
inertia and weakness of character, hut the fact remains that he is incapable of competing with the Roumanians and is therefore unfit to command the Armies in Roumania.In &apos;General--Ragosa1s-words &quot;The Russian Front in Roumania has become the Roumanian Front&quot;.     In other words the-./,:&apos;- -  &apos; &apos; &apos; -    -  -Russians have allowed themselves to come under the influence of the Roumanians accept their ruling and drift with them.I was in Roumania six weeks and during that time there was no improvement in the railway situation.     As formerly, every request by the Russians gave rise to endless correspondence, compliance and final nonfulfilment.In every Roumanian the Russians see a spy,     Can one blame them?     All officers wrho are not pro-German are anti-Russian .Only on the 20th Jan. were the Roumanians even talkingof laying military telephones.     Up to that time, all Orders andInstructions were issued to the unites concerned by the CivilTelephone and telegraph.     What can one expect under suchconditions?     I am firmly convinced that the enemy knows every orderthat is issued.     Apart from the Roumanian officers, the countrymust be a seething mass of. spies.It is impossible to wage war under present conditions.    Upinto .25th Jan. the staff 4th Army was/Tekuch, 10 versts from the firing line.     Now it is in Berlad.     Berlad is $0 versts from the firing line,  it is quite a small, town, and there are the staff of the front.     The Roumanian Headquaters.     The staff 4th Army.     The town is very over-crowded.     The work of the staff of the 4th Army is seriously interfered with.The following changes are essential to ensure the best possible results, from a military point of view.     Up to date these have.taken second place to politics and sentiment.The Roumanian Government must leave Roumania./Front
14-   37Front Head Quarters must be in Jassy, or much better in Kishenev.Railways, Post and Telegraph must be in Russianhands.A stronger man than General Sakharov must be Commander.in Chief.When a man of General Ragosa&apos;s character , experience and position, asks me to bring about England&apos;s intervention, it may be safely assumed that the situation is one of great seriousness.Of Rumanian politics I know nothing, but the Government is either unable, or unwilling to give the necessary assistance to enable the Russians to prepare an offensive or to maintain the Armies in the Rumanian Theatre.This is not a question which concerns Rumanians or Russians, but one which-directly concerns the Allies.     The Russians are apparently unable to make the Rumanians &quot;play the game&quot;, and are quite capable of sitting and saying &quot;isnt this awful&quot; until the crash comes.Some action must be taken at once.The Russian character is weak.     Under such circumstances as the present, they always lose what little individuality they naturally have, and assimulate with the forces surrounding them at the moment.     They are now playing directly into the Rumanians hands.     They demand endless delays stupid formalities;   and subordinate military necessities to political aims.I repeat, the Russian military authorities may be tied hand and foot by Petrograd diplomacy, and the Rumanians by Jassy - Berlin politics.     Both these currents drive us the same way, both will accomplish the destruction of the Russian Armies in Rumania.I am absolutely convinced that the Rumanian/Government
Government purposely delay preparations for an offensive, and would be delighted to see the last Russian soldier cross the Prut.We have sat at the cross roads long enough, we must now go one way or the other.     Either continue to pander to Politics, and Sentiment;    or take firm measures and put Military necessities before all.Russians compare the present situation to the situation in Greece.    &apos;There is certainly much in common.     If Rumania&apos;s entryrvintb the war was a mistake, why aggravate the mistake.If the British Government could persuade the Rumanian Government that the,Russians will not take any part of their country from them, and that Russian influence will not be established in Rumania I think they would greatly help the common cause.In general, the situation in Rumania is depressing to the last degree.     The Russians have hurried up troops without any thought of how they are to be supplied.     The Rumanians do nothing to help their Allies.     The Russians, with true Eastern apathy say &quot;isn&apos;t this awful, and isn&apos;t that awful&quot;. Having done this they fold their hands and wait for heaven to rain down manna.     Up to now some celestial Chinovnik has usually heard their complaints, but I am afraid this case is beyond him.The Germans will not willingly take up Roumania, and I fear that the Russians will make this Front a secondary Theatre of Operations.I cannot see how the British Government can influence matters, but I have been asked to bring this about, as being the only hope of avoiding a disaster.I am not acquainted with Rumania&apos;s political aims, and aspirations, it is beyond all doubt that she is doing/nothing
nothing to help matters.   I, personally, am convinced that she is purposely delaying all military preparations.    It is also clear that General Sakharov is unahle to force from them concessions which are essential for the very existence of his Armies.Picture Germany in our position.   Would sentiment, and politics over-ride Military necessities?   Would the Armies starve?   Would all railway traffic be in a state of stagnation?   We have learned things from Germany before now, we have Greece before^our eyes today.   Let ,us force Rumania to act as an Ally now that she has become one.Cannot Russia be forced to bestir herself,  and Rumania to be an Ally?
