ffEPQBT TO THB CABIZHiT.,14 th April, 1917.1.     The Air Board have had under consideration the steps which should he taken to obtain a 200 h.p. Rotary engine for next year.   No such engine has yet passed its trials, hut several are in course of development.     The most advanced of these is of the well-known Clerget type, and it has been suggested that it would/be worth while to instruct the firm of mayen in Paris, who have accepted a large order for the British, French and Russian Governments for Clerget engines of the 130 h.p. type (of which 700 are for the British Government), to equip tfeeir factory, (which is now nearing completion) instead for the -production of the 200 h,p* type.   Although such a step would evidently be somewhat in the nature of a gamble, it is argued that it would be justified by the necessity of having, .if possible, a Rotary engine of this power ready for next year.     The Trench Government were approached some time ago in regard to the above proposal, but have not yet replied.   It has been learnt, however, that, they have placed an order for 150 of these engines with another firm.    In these circumstances, a representative of the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies is proceeding to Paris to investigate the situation personally, with power tt complete the necessary ,arrangements for the modification of llessrsi kayen*s order.2.     The Air Board have had before them the Second
Interim Report of the liedical Research Committee, to which reference was made in the Report to the Cabinet of the 10th aarch.     The Committee have carried out experiments and recommend the adoption of an oxygen apparatus for the use of pilots ascending to great ,alti-tudes, as they find that siany pilots are affected at over 15,000 ft.      Although the apparatus is not at present asked for by the Expeditionary Force, it will probably be required next year in view of the constantly increasing-altitude reached by aeroplanes.   As it weighs some 14 lbs, there is a natural reluctance to.&quot; adopt it except when absolutely necessary.The Committee have made certain other recommendations relating to the physical standards for the admission of candidates to the Plying Corps, which have been referred to the Admiralty and the Y7ar Office for consideration.3*     A discussion has been proceeding between the Air Beard and the Foreign Office with reference to the suggested restrictions on the importation into Scandinavia of mahogany and other woods used in the construction of aircraft.     Inasmuch as the British Aviation Services use as much as 18,000 tons of mahogany per annum, and it is certain that the enemy-requirements must be cojisiderably greater, the Board are of opinion that any restrictions imposed on the importation of this wo04 and also of walnut and ash, into Germany through Ifeutral countries will tend to hamper the aircraft production of&apos;the enemy,4.     As the War Cabinet are aware, large orders were placed in France last year for engines of the Clerget, Le Rhone and Hispano-Suiza types.   Of the Hispano^Suiza
engine, as many as 3,500 have &quot;been ordered for the Royal i&quot;aval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps,   The Clorget sOiA Le Rhone engines are coming forward fairly up to expectations.   The deliveries of the Kispano-Suiza engine are now beginning, and it is of considerable importance to know the numbers which may be counted upon during the next fe^ months.   According to reports received from the Paris Office of the Controller of Aeronautical Supplies, tho deliveries will be up to the numbers for which allowance had been made in the forecast of which a summary was given in the Report to the Cabinet for the week to the 24th Larch.     These deliveries, however, are far short of those estimated by the firms- themselves and the deficiency is no doubt due, in a great measure, to the fact that the raw material promised from this country has not been made available     France as early as had-&quot;been expected by the firms.     The re son for this is,twofold.     In the first place, the actual output of stampings from Sheffield, as distinct from bar steel, is behindhand. The explanation is that Sheffieldmanufacturers are only now learning ho^ to turn these out in large quantities.    In the second place, the transport of material to France is- being conducted, as the Cabinet are aware, under great difficulties.     The Admiralty had arranged for a fortnightly service from Cardiff to Fantes, but owing to the prevailing conditions, this service has been delayed and is irregular.Everything possible, however, is being done to expedite both the production of stampings and the transport to France.
5*     The deliveries of engines and aeroplanes to date have &quot;been as followsTotal far Total for Total forweek end- March, March,ing 7th 1917. 1916, April.Engines 130 835 245Aeroplanes      140 730 219HOTE:- (l) The week to 7th April being Easter weok can only &quot; De considered as about two thirds of a normalworking week.(2) The doliveries for March, 1916, do not include any Admiralty figures,In addition to the above, 10 seaplanes were delivered in the week ending the 7th April, 1917.(Signed)     H.
