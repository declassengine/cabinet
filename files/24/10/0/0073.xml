Telegrams-;-^&quot;SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDON.&quot;0722994/17Any further communication on this subject should be addressed to The Secretary,Ministry of Shipping,St. James&apos;s Park,London, S.W., and the^f^JJo^vjng^nmTiber quoted.MINISTRY OF SHIPPING,A April, 1917.1.     I am directed by the Shipping Controller to re*-quest you to be so good as to Inform the War Cabinet thathe has been in communication with the First Corgis si oner of Works on the question of erecting an extension to the temporary building in which the Ministry of Shipping is accommodated.    Sir Alfred Mond states that under standing orders he is unable to comply with this request without the express authority of the War Cabinet, and he has aceord-ingly suggested that the matter should be referred to the Cabinet-with a view to the issue of the necessary instruction.2. .  The construction of an extension to the present building in St.James&apos;s park is a matter of urgent necessity. Sir Joseph uaclay feels that unless the whole of his Department can be concentrated in one building it will be impossible, for him efficiently to fulfil his responsibi-.lity for the control and management of the shipping resources of. the Empire.    He is therefore constrained to request the War CaMnet to make an exception, to the-&apos; general order in the case of his Department,3. The present building was designed and the founda-tions laid when the Transport Department was still a Branch of the Admiralty.   Since than the Shipping Controller wassecretary/ war cabinet,.   &apos;Whitehall Gardens. S.Y/........ ....... ...... &apos; ...... .1 ......   .        .........-..............
appointed, and has taken over from the Admiralty the Trans-port Department and the responsibility for mercantile tonnage on Government service.    In addition to this he took over the financial responsibility for mercantile tonnage in Naval Service, and the section of the Department o the Accountant General of the Navy, which has hitherto been responsible for this, was transferred to the Ministry of Shipping.4.    The Controller also found it essential to the effective management of the tonnage resources of the Empire, to take over (or establish) the following services which had not been carried on under the Transport Department, and concentrate them in the same building as the rest of his organization.Ship Building.       The section of the Board of Trade dealingwith this question was taken over-Ship Purchase,       The responsibility for this hadhitherto rested with the Admiralty and an expert staff has now been appointed by the Controller to deal with this sub-ject as a Branch of his Department.Compilation of       Sir Alfred V/atson and staff have been Statistics as to    attached to the ministry of Shipping the use of tonnage,for this purpose.Port and Transit    The existing organization of the Port questions, and Transit Committee is beingincorporated in the Ministry of Ship-ping/&apos; This means the supervision of the turning round of ships and involves loading; discharge and labour questions.The Management of   This important new responsibility, Liner Services.      resulting from the decision of the WarCabinet in regard to the control of all merchant shipping necessitates for its efficient discharge, considerable addi-tions to the organization-.Ship Licensing.      The responsibility for this, togetherwith the staff, have been taken &quot;over from the Board of Trade,
Allied Tonnage.Neutral Chartering.Ministry of Munitions Chartering Bureau;In order to secure the most econcmi-aal use possible of Allied tonnage and in particular British tannage lent to the Allies, it has been found necessary to bring about the closest possible co-operation between the Controller and the French and Italian Authorities and for this purpose it has been necessary to provide them with an office on the premises.It is necessary that th* section of the Board of Trade responsible for this should have accommodation in the building, in order to keep in the closest&quot;possible touch with the Controller.The control and responsibility for this have been taken over from the ministry of Munitions and although the staff remains in its office in the City, the responsibilities of the Ministry of Snipping have been increased by this addition and a corresponding increase of the head quarter staff has been necessary.8.    It is impossible to house all these Departments in the existing building without displacing the staff which is already there.; and further, the important section of tho Finance Branch which is dealing with mercantile tonnage on Naval Service is still housed outside the building owing to the impossibility of finding room in the existing accommodation,6.    The Controller is convinced that to house any section of the Ministry in a different building is to cause grave loss cf efficiency which is equivalent to waste and therefore loss of tonnage.7.    All the sections of the Department have to work in closest touch with other sections and any separation involves talay and imperfect co-ordination of the activities of the Various sections.   The experience of the past, when the Transport, Apartment was scattered in many different buildings, has made
A:It impossible to contemplate, without grave misgivings, any renewal of those conditions. I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Signed) J.Anderson.
