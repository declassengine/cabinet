SECRET. G.T. 487WAR CABIIET,0 P S R A T IOIS,From :- C.I.G.S. To:-General Hanoury Williams. Brigadier-General Knox,.14th April 1917.. 3,10 p..m.32689 Gioher.1We have received from you and elsewhere, much information as to situation in Russia and Russian Army. In order, however, to form working basis for future action, we must now reach definite conclusion regarding the assistanc^ to be expected from Russia in course of next six months.    I had hoped before revolution that.in Asiatic Turkey Russian action, combined with ours, might be productive of far reaching results, while in Europe I hoped Russia would hold existing enemy divisions.   Much more I did not expect.   Give me your considered opiniQn as to what we may hope for in &quot;both cases.   You should divest your mind of claptrap such as determination to win and fighting for freedom and so forth, remembering that without discipline and reasonableadmihiktrar tive efficiency, an army is merely a leaderless armed mob. Also, that unless the Army is supported by a stable govern-ment and sufficiently united public opinion, successful results are impossible.   It seems to me, amongst other con-tingencies, we must be prepared to see Germany leave Russians to stew in their own juice, and transfer considerable number of divisions to west front.Addressed General Hanbury Williams;   repeated Brigadier-General Knox.
COPYSECRET.OPERATIONS.General Hanbury Williams to CI.G.S. 16/4/17,979.This afternoon I had a long interview with Alexieff;   we discussed the following points;(l)   Necessity for definite conclusion as to the assistance we might expect from the Russians. (2)   Situation on Caucasus and European fronts.(3)   Discipline of the arsy and efficiency of the administration. (4)   Stability of the Government and Public opinion. (5)   Transfer of German troops from Russian front to Western. (6) .The question of the Baltic   -Fleet.He spoke partly officially and partly unofficially.     He admits that the situation is still bad but states that it is worse in Petrograd than with the armies at the front.   Armies are still useful for offensive purposes although they are not the same as before the Revolution.     In agreement with all front commanders with one expection it had been decided to take offensive on May 1st, old style.     I asked him whether he was satisfied with situation as regards heavy artillery and aviation or whether it was a Pis Aller as it seemed to me that there was no prospect of great success unless unanticipated improvement occurred in those branches.     He replied that they were in a considerably better position than last year although they had not all they would like to have.     As regards Asiatic Turkey owing to difficulties of supply and transport of which he has only just been made aware he can(? Hold) out no prospect of any effective general action on part of Caucasus Armies and only of General PAVLQFF   in the event of General Maude being   able to supply.........iiiiiiiiBiiiii in in n i niiiiiiiiiiiiiiimiiiiiii mini i i mi u ii urn i mi in mill ill mi mill i 11111111111111111 mum 11 111111111 111 hi i   mil ii iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ill ii i nih ii   ii hiiiiii i i iii i i iiiiiiiiiii iiiii iiii in hi .....&apos;
him with provisions.     The Railways are in a had state and any improvement which can come from America can of course only come much later on.As to the Government and its stability he can only give me hia private and personal views which are to the effect that the opposition still have the game more or less in their own hands although the Government is slowly strengthening.A success at the front would however re-establish a united public opinion for energetic continuance of the War.Alexieff does not consider that we need expect any important transfer of this kind as he is personally confident that the steps they are taking will retain in any case the hulk of the German divisions here.As to the Baltic Fleet, those who say it will he in order by the opening of navigation are, in his opinion, too optimistic.Note.   The dissentient General mentioned above is said &quot;by Alexieff to be Russki.
From General. Knox.To;    C.I.S.S. 16.4.17.1055.     Your 32689.I do not believe in any great Russian offensive either in Turkey, in Asia or on the Western frontier. The long lines of communications in the first mentioned theatre .will offer difficulties which will baffle Russian power of organisation.   As to the Western frontier, the loss of discipline renders any serious attempt at attack .. most improbableThere seems&apos; a chance that the Germans may take advantage of the disorganised state of the. Baltic fleet and the low morale of the troops on the northern front to make a combined&apos; land and sea attempt to threaten Petrograd.    There is, however, at present no evidence that.such.an attempt is in preparation, and failing its commencement in the course of the next two months, it seems likely that the enemy will have a light screen along the Russian front transferring, several divisions to the&apos; Western, theatre.   Major Thornhill has gone to. the Western . front and I am going to the Northern front to-night. I shall be able on return to furnish a fuller report, but I regret to say that on the evidence so far available the above is my considered opinion.
