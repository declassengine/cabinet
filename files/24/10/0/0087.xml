INTRODUCTION.Scope of the Committee&apos;s Enquiry.THE work entrusted to the Committee&apos;&apos;&apos;1&apos; was that of summarising and co-ordinating the work done by the Foreign Claims Office and by the Public Trustee in connection with claims by and against the enemy arising out of the war.2. It may be well to explain that the Foreign Claims Office deals with claims by British subjects against the enemy Governments. The sphere of the Public Trustee is that of English property in the enemy countries and enemy property in the United Kingdom, but officers charged with, similar duties have now&apos;been appointed throughout the British Empire, so that in time, when the records of ail these officials are summarised, there should be a complete record of the British property in the enemy countries and of enemy property in the British Empire. Claims by British subjects against private individuals in the enemy countries are dealt with as property and handled by the Public Trustee. The task&apos; entrusted to the Committee may therefore be defined roughly as that of reporting on British claims against the enemy to property or compensation.Enemy Debts Committee.3. Since the Committee was set up, the Treasury, after consultation with the Foreign Office, have appointed a strong Committee under the chairmanship of. Sir H. Babington Smith, K.C.B., known as the &quot;Enemy Debts Committee,&quot; with the following terms of reference: &quot;to report on the arrangements to be adopted for the liquidation of the commercial, banking, and other financial transactions between British and enemy persons the completion of which was prevented by the outbreak of war, and for this purpose to consider the returns .... .&quot; (made to the Public Trustee, the Foreign Claims Office, &amp;c).4. Four members of the Committee were requested by the Treasury, to serve on the new Committee. It soon became evident that the enquiries of the Treasury Committee would cover much ground in connection with claims to property which this Committee would otherwise have explored. They have therefore decided to refrain from reporting on this portion of their terms of reference until the report of the Enemy Debts Committee is framed, and have concentrated their attention upon claims of other kinds.Report limited to Shipping Claims up to October 31, 1916.5. This report deals only with shipping claims, and, for reasons which are explained in the report, it only comprises claims up to the 31st October, 1916.6. The principle adopted in connection with shipping claims has been to regard as claims only those which arise from some belligerent naval action on the part of the enemy which was not justified by the rules of war. The reason for this is that to exact redress for loss or injury caused to British shipping by naval operations which were legitimate, and were similar to those carried out by Great Britain and her Allies against enemy ships and cargoes, is in reality to exact an indemnity, not to enforce claims. If an indemnity can be exacted, there is no reason why the measure of it should in any way be the amount of the damage inflicted by the enemy.7. After the Committee had been appointed they received special directions to deal in their Report with the questions arising as to, ships in enemy ports (whether German or British) at the outbreak of the war. Part II of this Report relates to such ships.* The Committee consisted of C. J. B. Hurst, Esq., C.B., K.C. (Chairman); Hon. M. M. Macnaghten and the Hon. Mr. Justice Peterson (Directors of the Foreign Claims Office); C. J. Stewart, Esa. (the Public Trustee); E. C. Blech, Esq., C.M.G. (Foreign Office); Commander Anderson, E.N. (Admiralty); C. Tenny-son, Esq., C.M.G. (Colonial Office); Hi W. Malkin, Esq. (Foreign Office); J. J. Wills, Esq. (Board of Trade); Major S. J. M. Sampson, M.C., acted as Secretary.
8. At an early stage of the work it became clear that if the Committee were to present a report of any value many claims must be included which had not been registered with the Foreign Claims Office. The custom of shipowners and merchants is to insure their ships or cargoes afloat. Where those ships or cargoes are destroyed the owner abandons his rights to and recovers the loss from the underwriter. The owner has, therefore, no further interest in the matter, as the loss has been made up to him. Claims by the owners are, therefore, by no means universal. At the beginning of the war a Government insurance scheme was brought into force, under which the major portion of the risk as to the ship was borne by the Government; a corresponding scheme for cargo was also introduced. The result was that underwriters have in many: instances not recorded claims with the Foreign Claims Office. To work -only on the -claims recorded with that office would mot have ^enabled the &apos;Coramittee&apos;s Report to afford any clear idea of the losses inflicted upon the -country by the enemy&apos;s &quot;belligerent faction at sea in contravention &quot;of the rules of war, and after ascertaining -that it would fee&apos; in accordance with the desires of the Secretary of State ifkr Foreign -Affairs, the Committee decided to include in their Report all losses due to illegal action at sea --against British ships whether claims have feeen registered or not.British cargo on foreign shiips excluded.9. No -attempt has been made to include an this Report losses -caused to His Majesty&apos;s &quot;Government or to British, subjects-as owners *of cargo on board Allied or neutral ships illegally destroyed by the enemy. If information as to the extent of the injury inflicted on this country by such action on the part of the enemy can be obtained, and if it is desired that the Committee should report on it, it can be made the subject of a separate report.Gargo known to be.foreign -on British ships excluded.10. As -the Oommittee&apos;s enquiry has dealt only with the injury done to British &quot;interests, cargo -on British ships which was known to belong to Allied or neutral subjects or-Governments has been excluded, but in most cases exact information as to the ownership of the cargo was not given, and it is possible, therefore, that much * of -what -has been included may have -belonged to foreigners. On the other hand, cargo -belonging to* foreigners may have been -insured or re-insured in this country, so that the loss was ultimately borne fey Great -Britain.Aggregate of claims.11. The grand aggregate of the claims dealt with in Part I of this Report amounts to 77,.520,605L -10s. Of-this-total 49,4 48,230L 19s. U. represents direct loss, i.e., value of ships and cargoes, disbursements, effects, &amp;c, and 28,072,374L 10s. M. -represents indirect loss, such as the unearned profits of the ships and interest on the value of the cargoes. Torthis ttotal should be added in respect -of -every month after !the 31st October, 1916,.*2;353$350L 9s. 9d. There is also a nonrecurrent sum of 79,0131. 0s. od. in -respect-of --repairs-to ships damaged ;bef ore !the ,31st October, 1916, but of which the &quot;repairs -were coinpleted after that date.
PART I.(A.) Claims for Ships Illegally Detained by the Enemy before the Outbreakof War.1. TWENTY-NINE British, merchant-ships appear, so far as is at present known, to have been prevented by the German authorities from sailing from German ports, or after sailing were turned back, while peace still existed. Four British merchant-ships were similarly detained in Turkish ports before the outbreak of war.2. A detailed list of the ships improperly detained in German ports is contained in Schedule (A).   A list of those improperly detained in Turkish ports is contained inSchedule (B). &apos;3. After careful consideration, the Committee are satisfied that the proper-basis of redress in these cases is to claim (a) the return of the ship in her pre-war condition ;(b) the net profits which she would have earned if she had not been detained ; and(c) the repayment of all sums properly expended by her owners by reason of her detention.4. In two cases it is known that the Germans have requisitioned the vessel, and that while in use by them she has been sunk. In these cases there should be substituted for (a) supra, the value of the ship at the end of the war, but in her pre-war condition.Method of Calculating Unearned Profits..5. No exact estimate of the profits which a group of vessels would have earned during the war is possible. By laborious investigation a reasonably accurate assessment might be made in respect of any particular ship, as the earnings of some similar vessel might be enquired into, but the number of ships with which the Committee have had to deal is very large, and as their aim has been to obtain some general and approximate figure of the losses imposed upon the country by the injury done to shipping, a detailed enquiry into the earning power of each individual ship would have been waste of time. The course followed has been to take a general all round rate of profit per month, and to apply this in all cases. Though this rate would be too, low in the case of many ships and would be too high in others, yet taken as a general all round rate, the Committee believe that it will be sufficiently accurate. The rate taken up to the 30th September, 1916, has been 30s. per ton gross per month. Sir Norman Hill and Sir Frederick Bolton thought that, for the Committee&apos;s purposes, this rate might safely be adopted. In arriving at this estimate the Committee have not been unmindful of the fact that a large proportion of British tonnage has been requisitioned and is, therefore, working at Blue Book rates. By the month of October, 1916, the rates of profit had risen, and for that month 21. per gross ton has, therefore, been taken.Depreciation.6. The rates above-mentioned are considered sufficient to include the provision of a depreciation fund sufficient to meet the cost at the end of the war of restoring the ships to their pre-war condition. The Committee, however, thought it would be useful to ascertain the cost of this restoration as a separate item. The information available as to their present condition is small, and no close estimate can be formed. From enquiries which have been made, it appears that the cost of such restoration will probably be from 14 to 18 per cent, per annum of the pre-war value of the ships. This does not include the cost of replacing the copper and other valuable metals of which Germany is in need, and which it is said have been stripped from the vessels.So far as is known, watchmen have been employed by the owners to take care of the ships in only three cases. It may safely be assumed, therefore, that the ships have been neglected..7. The expenditure under (c) includes expenses entailed upon the owners for watchmen, &amp;c.^ and also the wages of the officers and crew, up to the date when any of these persons was released from internment. These sums have been ascertained from the owners of the ships.Claims calculated up to October 31, 1916.8. The full amount of the claim, either under (a), (6), or (c), cannot be satisfactorily determined until the end of the war; the deterioration of the ships is proceeding; the [401] C
sum of-profits lost increases with the lapse of time, and the expenditure on wages of the crew, &amp;c, is continuing. The course the Committee have adopted, therefore, is to estimate these amounts up. to the 31st October, 1916, and to suggest a further amount representing the monthly additions which should be made under each head. This will enable a fairly good idea to be obtained at any time of the aggregate amount of the claims, and it will also enable the Committee to revise the amounts more closely if so desired.Summary.9. The aggregate tonnage of the twenty-nine vessels illegally detained in German ports Avas 46,790 tons gross. Their value at the beginning of the war, based upon estimates made by the owners of the ships, is returned at 8bl,050Z. The Committee are advised, however, that this figure is probably substantially too high, and that 567,8141 would be more accurate.It has already been mentioned that two of the ships have been sunk by the enemy. They were valued by their owners at 15,2001., but the Committee are advised that their value at the beginning of the war was in reality higher, and should be taken at 23,1151 Assuming that the remaining twenty-seven vessels are still in existence and are returned by the enemy at the end of the war, the amount which must be allowed to restore them to good condition-i.e., for depreciation is, at 18 per cent, per annum, 220,5611. Deterioration is probably proceeding at a rate of about 1  per cent, per month on the capital value of 544,599Z., and the above amount must therefore be increased at the rate of 8,169Z. per month. As already explained, if the claim for loss of profits is put forward at the rates mentioned in paragraph 5, these items will be covered by it, and should not be put forward in addition.If the copper and brass parts have been removed, the Committee is advised that a sum of 45*22 per cent, of the above capital value of 544,599Z. must be allowed to cover these metal parts ; this would work out at 246,1931.The profits which these twenty-nine ships would have earned up to the 31st October, 1916, calculated as in paragraph 5, are estimated at 1,918,391Z., and the monthly sum to represent future earnings 93,5S0Z.The amount stated by the owners of three of these vessels to have been expended by them for watchmen, &amp;c, is 5S9Z. 8s. 4d. up to the 7th August, 1915, when two of them were sunk, and up to the 31st October, 1916, in the case of the third ship.*The sum representing the wages which would have accrued to the members of the crews up to the time of their release, if any^ from internment, or up to the 31st October, 1916, amounts to 122,1271. 13s. Id. The monthly sum to cover wages in the future may be taken at 4,1041. 10s. Sd., but this sum will be-subject to deduction if any of the men are released.10. The aggregate tonnage of the four vessels illegally detained in Turkish ports is 4,928 tons. So far as is known, they are all still in existence. Of these four vessels, one (the &quot; Craigforth &quot;) was injured by a mine placed by the Turks in the fairway of the Bosphbrus while that country was still at peace, and while, therefore, the placing of a mine in that position was without justification. The vessel was under repair at the time when war broke out, but, as her detention was directly due to the illegal act of the Turkish Government, she has been treated, for the purposes of this Report, as a vessel illegally detained by the Turkish Government.The value of these four vessels is given by the owners at 54,000Z. The Committee are advised, however, that this is too high, and that 38,7121. would be more accurate. If they are returned at the end of the war, the amount which should be allowed to restore them to their pre-war condition would be 15,678Z. up to 31st October, 1916, and a further monthly sum of 581Z. should be allowed to cover deterioration after that date. If the claim for loss of profits is put forward at the rates mentioned in paragraph 5 these items should not be put forward in addition.If the copper and brass parts have been removed a further sum of 17,497Z. should be claimed.The profits these vessels would have earned up to the 31st October, 1916, calculated as in paragraph 5, are estimated at 178,023Z., and the monthly sum to represent subsequent earnings is estimated at 9,856Z.No sums have been returned by the owners for expenditure incurred by them in connection with these ships except in the case of the &quot;Craigforth,&quot; where the owners disbursed sums amounting to 5.970Z. in respect of the injury due to the mine. 92Z. has also been paid to the officers and men of this vessel to cover the loss of their effects.
Disposal of Compensation, if Recovered.-11. If the vessels, or their value, are recovered from the enemy, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be called upon ultimately to decide whether or not they should be returned to the parties interested. This is not a matter on which the Committee feel&quot;. that they need make any recommendation. They would point out, however, that the owners would seem to have a good claim to be repaid sums which they have actually disbursed, other than wages, and the Committee have therefore shown these amounts separately.12. The disposal of any sums recovered from the enemy as representing the wages of officers and crews, while those persons were undergoing internment, appeared to be sufficiently complicated to render it expedient that the Committee should make some suggestions on the subject.At&apos; the outbreak of the war a scheme was introduced under the auspices of the Board of Trade for the benefit of the dependants of the crews of detained ships under which they were to be paid half wages or IL a week through the war risk insurance clubs. The scheme was non-contributory, and the clubs were to recover 80 per cent, of the loss from the Board of Trade. Where the vessel was not insured under the Government scheme because it was not m a club the dependants&apos; allowances were to be paid by the owner, who would recover 80 per cent, from the Board of Trade.These sums were not regarded as coming out of the men&apos;s wages ; consequently, where a man had signed an allotment note the Board of Trade bore only 80 per cent, of the amount,paid to the dependants after deducting the allotment note, liability for the allotment note falling on the owner or on the club as part of the man&apos;s wages for which the owner or the club was liable.Towards the end of 1915 the House of Lords decided in the case of Beal v. Horlock that after the detention by the enemy the owner was no longer liable on an allotment note; consequently, from that time onward the Board of Trade have been liable in all cases for 80 per cent, of the amount paid under the scheme of dependants&apos; allowances.If the full amount of the wages of the officers and crew from the date of the detention up till their release from internment can be recovered from the enemy the reasonable arrangement would be that the Government should be refunded 80 per cent, of the dependants&apos; allowances which has been paid by them, the clubs or the owners should be refunded the 20 per cent, paid by them, and any further sums under allotment notes, and the balance should go &apos;to the individual officer or man who was interned.Cargo Claims.13. The information at the disposal of the Committee does not lead them to think that there was any large quantity of cargo belonging to British owners on these illegally detained ships. So far as there was cargo on board the ships at all, British interests in it have probably in most cases become the subject of direct claims against the enemy Government, e.g., by the requisitioning of the goods, or were interests which were defeasible, e.g., where an unpaid German vendor was able to recover the goods.The Committee have therefore assumed that there were no British interests in cargo on board these improperly detained ships other than those which have been recorded with the Foreign Claims Office. Under the heading of &quot; Shipping Claims &quot; they have included only claims to cargo where there is no allegation that the enemy Government have requisitioned the goods. Claims for goods they have requisitioned have been dealt with elsewhere.The total amount of the claims to cargoes on board illegally detained ships in Germany recorded with the Foreign Claims Office, excluding claims dealt with under other headings, is 22,608L Ils. This amount may not be complete and may require modification in the future. A claim to cargo worth 21,1101. is made in respect of the &quot; Craigforth.&quot;Total Claim under Section (A).14., The aggregate claims arising out of the improper detention of these vessels before the outbreak of war may be estimated at 2,876,350Z. 6s. 3d. up to the .31st October, 1916, increasing by 107,5401. 10s. 8d. per month after that date.
(B.)-Claims for Merchant-Ships Destroyed by an Enemy Cruisernot entitled to the status op a warship.15. Great Britain has consistently maintained since the &quot; Malacca&quot; incident in 1904 that a merchant-ship could not be converted validly into a warship on the high seas. Early in the war the German steamship &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm,&quot; of the North German Lloyd Line, left the port of New York and converted herself on the high seas into a warship. At a later date she returned to the United States and was interned, but in the interval she had captured and sunk nine British merchant-ships.16. If the principle hitherto insisted on by Great Britain is adhered to the capture of these nine British vessels was in contravention of the rules of war, and should be made the basis of a claim against the German Government.17. A list of the vessels sunk by the &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm,&quot; with the details relating to each, is given in Schedule (Cj.The Committee are satisfied that if a claim is to be made in these cases the proper measure of redress is (a) the replacement of the ship, either in kind or in money, together with the net profits she would have earned from the date of her destruction up till the moment she is replaced ; (&amp;) the value of the cargo at the time when it was destroyed, with interest thereon up to the date of payment; (c) the value of any effects lost by passengers or crew ; (d) expenses incurred in the repatriation of the passengers or crew ; (e),repayment of any compensation paid by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the widows or dependants of officers or members of the crews who lost their lives.4Summary.18. The total tonnage of the vessels sunk by the &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot; is 38,010 tons gross.The aggregate value of the ships at the outbreak of war was about 500,000L, and at the time of their destruction was about 555,5001.The net profits which the ships would have earned from the date of their destruction up to the 31st October, 1916, calculated in accordance with paragraph 5. is estimated at 1,300,4811., and a further sum of 76,0201. per month may be added to this to represent profits accruing subsequent to that date.The aggregate value of the cargoes sunk with the ships was 719,0801.. Adding interest at 5 per cent..per annum from the date of destruction up to the 31st October, the compensation in respect of the cargo should be 785,0001., and a further sum of 3,254Z. per month may be added to represent interest accruing after the 31st October.The claims recorded with the &quot;Foreign Claims Office in respect of effects lost by passengers only amount to 61.The sums paid out by the Board of Trade in respect of the effects lost by officers and seamen is 1,158Z., and by Lloyd&apos;s 30L (see below, paragraph 21).The expenses incurred in the repatriation of passengers and crews are reported at 1,4701, of which 1,2201. has been paid through the Board of Trade and 250L by the owners of the &quot; Wilfred M.&quot;One life was lost in the sinking of these ships, and the compensation paid under this head may be taken at 600Z. (see below, paragraph 22).Government Insurance Scheme,   (a.) Vessel.19. The amounts at which the ships have been valued in paragraph 18 have been supplied by the shipowners themselves.Eight of these nine vessels were insured against war risk and obtained the benefit of the Government insurance scheme, under Which the Government take 80 -per cent, of the risk and the War Risk Association bear 20 per cent. The owners have in these cases been paid as for a total loss, but for the purpose of the scheme a value is placed on the ship which is arrived at by a rule of thumb calculation, and it does not therefore always represent the full value. The value is taken at the prime cost less&apos;4 per cent! for each year which has elapsed since the vessel was built. On account of the rise in the value of ships, the sum so arrived at was increased by 20 per cent, on the 10th March, 1915, and from the 3rd January, 1916, was increased by 50 per cent. The total amount for which the eight vessels were insured in the Government scheme was 436,663^. This total may. be compared with 496,000Z., the amount returned by the respective shipowners as representing the values on the 5th August, 1914, and 551,500Z., the values when the vessels were destroyed.
(b.) Cargo.   .20. The Government insurance scheme for cargo covered the whole risk which the owner chose to insure, but the scheme was not compulsory. Throughout the war a considerable amount of cargo has been insured outside the Government scheme ; at one time the amount within it did not cover more than a small proportion of the cargo afloat, consequently the Committee have not, for the purpose of their enquiry, taken the figures of the value of the cargo from the insurance scheme, but have obtained them direct from the owners of the ship or cargo.(c.) Seamen s Effects.21. A Government insurance scheme was also introduced at an early stage of the war to cover the effects of officers and crews lost by war risks. The amounts insured and the premiums charged varied from 100Z. insuied for a year for 40s. in the case of masters, down to 5Z. per year for 2s. in the case of ordinary seamen and firemen.As, however, this insurance scheme was not started at the beginning of the war a Committee was appointed by the Board of Trade to make gratuitous allowances to seamen who had lost Jheir effects by war risks, and who, in the opinion of the Committee, had not an effective opportunity of insuring under the Government insurance scheme. The vessels sunk by the &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm &quot; were sunk prior to the introduction of the insurance scheme, and the claims for compensation by the officers and crew for the loss of their effects were therefore dealt with by the Committee.Compensation for Dependants of Crew.22. At an early stage of the war a scheme was introduced for giving compensation to the dependants of officers or crews of merchant-ships who were killed or injured by the enemy. The scale of compensation was similar to that in force for the auxiliary ships of His Majesty&apos;s navy: pensions and grants are given to widows, and alloAvances are made for each child of tender years. To capitalise the value of all pensions and allowances made under this scheme would be an endless task, and on the advice of the representatives of the Board of Trade, the Committee decided to take a round sum as representing the general average cost to the nation of each death inflicted in this way by the enemy. After consulting the Liverpool and London War Risks Association, through which a great number of claims of this kind have been settled, the Marine Department of the Board of Trade recommended to the Committee that 600Z. should be adopted as the figure. This will be sufficient to cover also the cases where com-pensation has been given to persons injured.Disposal of Compensation.23. If compensation from the enemy can be recovered upon the basis suggested above, His Majesty&apos;s Government would appear to have an equitable claim to retain it, and use it in diminution of the general cost of the war. The only exceptions are those of claims for effects lost by passengers, and for expenses of repatriation of the crews paid by the shipowners/ In those two cases it would seem equitable to pay the amount to the individuals.   It is unlikely that such losses were covered by insurance.The shipowners have, no doubt, in practically every case recovered the insured value of the ships from the underwriters, and thus been reimbursed to the extent to which they chose to cover themselves against war risks. The underwriters have merely been unfortunate in a speculative commercial transaction; the losses in such businesses must be set against the sums received as premiums. Furthermore, a large proportion of the insurance risks are borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government.. Where the shipowner has been paid for a loss, he has been able to replace his ship, and has, therefore, earned profits; he can, therefore, have no claim to the compensation obtained under the head of unearned profits.The same principles apply in the case of the cargo ; and under the other heads of claim it is upon His Majesty&apos;s Government that the loss has in each case fallen.^ Furthermore, in the case of the&quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm &quot; captures, the circumstance which invalidated the German action and justifies the claim for compensation is the breach of a technical rule upheld by His Majestys Government, but with which the individual shipowners or underwriters are but little concerned.   It makes very little[401] D
difference to the shipowner whether his vessel was captured by one German cruiser or another, but it is only in the case of the captures effected by the &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm &quot; that it is possible to say that there was any action by the enemy wrhieh was in contravention of the rules of war., V . Allied View.24; It is right for the Committee to call attention to. one matter in connection with these claims for vessels sunk by the &quot;Kronprinz Wilhelm,&quot; though it is not one which it is within their province to discuss. The claims are based entirely upon the ground that as this vessel was converted upon the high seas she was not entitled to the status of a warship, and that all her belligerent actions were, therefore, invalid. France and Russia have both repudiated this view as to conversion upon the high seas, and Italy has adopted a neutral attitude. Our Allies could scarcely, therefore, put forward claims similar to those dealt with in this section of the Report.Total Claim under Section (B).25. The aggregate claims arising out of the destruction of vessels by the &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm&quot; may be estimated at 2,644,2451. up to the 31st October, 1916, increasing by 79,274/. per month after that date.

The great bulk of the shipping claims arise under these two heads.   For the purpose of this Report they are dealt with together.Submarine Claims.27. The Committee have been informed by the Admiralty that it is not safe to assume that every act of destruction or injury by an enemy submarine has been in contravention of the rules of war. The Admiralty representative has supplied the Committee with a list of those cases up to 31st October, 1916, in which it is considered that the enemy has acted improperly, and only those cases have been included.The improper acts complained of are as follows (a) In 109 cases the vessels were attacked without warning by a submarine and -sunk or (in a few cases) damaged.(6.) In 40 cases the vessels were captured and sunk after warning, but loss of life occurred which was directly due to the conduct of the submarine, e.g., by shelling the vessel, although she did hot try to escape, by shelling the crew in their boats, or by leaving them in open boats in bad weather far from shore.(c.) In 306 cases the vessels were captured and sunk after warning, but the crews were left to take to their boats under circumstances in which boats cannot be considered &quot; a place of safety,M either because of the weather or the distance from shore. These cases differ from (b), supvq, only in that no loss of life occurred, the crews being picked up by other vessels or (in a few cases) making the shore, though usually in a state of exhaustion. Cases in which the submarine arranged for a neighbouring vessel to pickup the crew have not been included, indeed, it may be said that all cases have been excluded in which the enemy submarine made any serious attempt to comply with the obligations of humanity or the rules of war.28. In many cases enemy submarines fired torpedoes at British vessels without giving any warning, but the torpedo missed the vessel and no injury was done. These cases have been omitted, for the reason that no loss has been inflicted, and therefore there is nothing on which to base a claim.29. The Committee have considered the question whether a claim for the full value of the ship and cargo is justifiable in cases where due warning was given to the ship before she was sunk, but the submarine subsequently violated the rules of war in some way, as, for instance, by firing on the crew after they had taken to the boats or by not putting them in a place of safety. The Committee have come to the conclusion that in these cases the correct view is that, although the original capture and sinking may have been legal, the subsequent action of the submarine vitiated the capture and sinking ab initio, and that in consequence these are to be regarded as illegal, and compensation claimed in the same way as for ships sunk without warning. An analogy may be drawn from the doctrine of &quot; trespass ab initio &quot; in English law. It should be maintained that the submarine ought not to have sunk the ship at all unless she could provide for the safety of the crew. She ought to have preferred to &apos; allow her to proceed rather than cause loss of life or injury to the crews of non-combatant vessels.30. A somewhat similar question arises in connection with cargo which consisted of absolute contraband transported on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Some of the ships sunk had been requisitioned and were carrying cargoes of contraband. The enemy may argue that he is justified in sinking such ships at sight, but the Committee do not think that any such contention would be well founded. A submarine which sinks a ship without warning obviously knows nothing of the nature of the cargo, and a submarine which fires upon the crews while in their boats, or neglects to put the crews in a place of safety, has vitiated the original sinking, ab initio, whatever the nature of the cargo may be.
Mine Claims.31. In respect of vessels injured or destroyed by mines the Committee were informed by the Admiralty representative that all such cases should be included in the Report as the whole policy of the enemy in sowing the high seas with floating or other mines, without giving due warning, was regarded as in contravention of the rules of war..   i      &apos; &apos;.- -&quot; :&apos;&apos;:.[&apos;   ;-.     -..&apos; .:Basis of Claims. .32. The Committee therefore recommend that compensation should be claimed on the following basis in respect of all ships within the scope of this part of their Report, viz: (a.) The replacement of the ship,.either in kind or money, together with the net profits she would have earned from the date of the destruction up till the moment she is replaced. In the case of fishing vessels the value will include that of any gear destroyed or lost. Where the vessel was only injured and was repaired, the cost of the repairs should be exacted, together with the net profits she would have earned while under repair.(b.) The value of the cargo at the time it was destroyed, with interest thereon up to the date of repayment; where the cargo was only injured, the measure of compensation should be the depreciation in the value of the cargo injured, together with any general average expenses incurred.(c.) The value of any effects lost by passengers, officers, or crew.(d.) Repayment of any compensation paid to officers or crew who were injured, or to the widows or dependants of officers or members of the crews who lost their lives.(e.) Expenses incurred in the repatriation of the passengers, officers, and crew. (/.) Compensation in respect of passengers who lost their lives, or for passengers who were injured.Difficulty of Getting Information.33. A list of the merchant-ships and fishing vessels improperly destroyed by a submarine, with details respecting each, so far as it has been possible to obtain them, will be found in Schedules (D) and (E). Similar lists of the merchant-ships and fishing vessels mined will be found in Schedules (F) and (G).34. The Committee have had the utmost difficulty in obtaining complete information as to these vessels. A large number of the vessels had been requisitioned by the Admiralty and were carrying goods for different Government Departments ; as to some of these no information has been forthcoming. In a few cases the parties interested in vessels engaged in ordinary trade have failed to reply to the Committee&apos;s application for information. The schedules are, therefore, necessarily incomplete and only contain the information which the Committee have been able to obtain up to the date of their report. The aggregate amounts of the claims will be subject to revision as further details are obtained.Unearned Profits for Fishing Vessels.35. The rate at which the net profits should be estimated in the case of fishing-vessels has been a matter of some perplexity to the Committee. The system adopted - in the fishing industry of.giving masters and crews a share of the proceeds realised by the sale of fish at the port where it is landed introduces various elements which need not be taken into account in calculating the profits of a merchant-ship. The high prices of fish during the war have resulted in the earnings of the fishermen being very large, but, in cases where the men have not lost their lives, the earning power of the men is not destroyed by the destruction of the ship; only the share of the profits attributable to the vessel should therefore be taken into account. The best informa-tion which the Committee has been able to obtain leads them to think that a rate of 21. per gross ton per month would not be very wide of the mark in respect of the profits up to the close of the year 1916, and this rate has been adopted accordingly.
Merchant-ships destroyed by submarines,,        ,,   damaged   ,, ,,Pishing vessels destroyed ,,        ,, Merchant-ships destroyed by mines damaged  ,,    ,,Fishing vessels destroyed ,,     ,, In 457 cases the Committee have been able to obtain adequate particulars for their report; in the remainder this has not been possible so far.   The Committee can only hope that they will be able to obtain the information and, at some future time, to revise the results contained in the present Report.38. The total British tonnage improperly destroyed by submarines up. to the 31st October, 1916, was 1,064,128 (gross), and by mines 339,543. The values so far as ascertained are ships 29,290,449Z., cargoes 16,411,2291. The sums which the enemy should be called on to pay for unearned profits amount to 23,931,0211. up to the 31st October, 1916, and thereafter to 2,098,4S8Z. monthly. Interest on the value of the cargoes up to the same date amounts to 665,5351.- 13s. Id., and thereafter to&apos;66,0931. 3s. 5d. monthly.39. The sums paid out by the Board of Trade in respect of effects lost by officers and members of the crews amounting to 102,0001. include those paid up to the 4th December, 1916, and not to the 31st October only as mother cases. Compensation has been given in ninety-nine cases to officers or members of the crews of vessels who were injured, and in 2,219 cases to widows and dependants of those who lost their lives. The compensation under this head is estimated at 1,331,4001. (see paragraph 22 above). The observations contained in paragraphs 19 to 23 above apply also to this section of the Report.Claim in Respect of the Deaths of Passengers.40. Claims filed with the Foreign Claims Office on behalf of the dependants of of passengers who lost their lives amount to 80,956Z. ; there are also undefined claims based on income lost amounting to 3,390Z. per annum. The practice which has been adopted by the office with regard to claims in respect of passengers who lost their lives through the illegal destruction of British vessels (e.g. the &quot; Lusitania &quot;) is some-what analogous to that followed in the Courts of the United Kingdom in cases where death results from a wrongful act. In such cases Lord Campbell&apos;s Act provides that an action can be brought only by some person who can show that the death of the deceased resulted in pecuniary loss to him, as for instance a widow or child who was dependent on the deceased for maintenance. Where the death of a British subject is due to action by the enemy at sea in contravention of the rules of war, and by reason of the death British subjects who were dependent on the deceased have suffered pecuniary loss, claims against the enemy Government for compensation in respect of the pecuniary loss so caused are registered in the Foreign Claims Office. In all such cases the claimants are required to verify by statutory declaration the pecuniary loss which they have sustained. Claims for solatium on account of the death without proof of pecuniary loss.have not been admitted. Some such rule must be adopted in dealing with particular claims which are to be presented on behalf of individuals, as in such cases it is necessary to prove damage, but it affords no reason against His Majesty&apos;s Government insisting, if they are in a position to do so, on the payment by the enemy [401] ETreaty. Exemption for Fishing Vessels.36. Germany is one of the parties to the Convention (No. XI) signed at The Hague in 1907 which introduced certain limitations on the right of capture in maritime war.r Under article 3 of this Convention &quot; vessels employed exclusively in coast fisheries and small boats employed in local trade &quot; were to be exempt from capture. These phrases are somewhat vague, but it is understood that the Convention did not intend to grant immunity to deep-sea fishing vessels. Under these circumstances the Committee have based the claims for destroyed fishing boats on the ground of breach of treaty, but, when it comes to pressing&quot; the claims for fishing boats included in this Report, the terms of this Convention may well be used in support of them.Summary of Claims.37. The number of vessels injured before.the 31st October, 1916, which were reported as coming within this section of the Report, is as follows : 280..        ....  &apos;    8     *168.. ..      114t * mm mm 2t)36
(E.) Ships Sunk oe Damaged by Zeppelin Airships.44. One ship, the &quot; Franz Fischer,&quot; has been sunk by a Zeppelin. She was a German vessel detained at the outbreak of war and requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Committee recommend that compensation should be claimed in respect of her in the same way as for enemy requisitioned ships destroyed by enemy submarines or mines, but that in the same way a claim should be admitted for compensation for her non-return (see paragraph 61 of Part II of this Report).45. Four British fishing vessels have sustained damage from Zeppelins, but in each case the actual damage done has been to the fishing gear, which was cut away.The claim in these cases, therefore, seems to be confined to the cost of replacing the gear and compensation for the loss of profits during the period required for such replacement. This period has been taken as one month, and calculated in the same way as for fishing vessels sunk by enemy submarines or mines.46. The names and particulars of these ships are contained in Schedule (H).The value of the &quot; Franz Fischer &quot; at the date when she was sunk is reported as 40,000Z. Compensation for loss of profits in respect of her, calculated as in paragraph 5, amounts to 11,640Z. up to the 31st October, 1916, and thereafter to 1,940Z. monthly. Thirteen lives were lost when she was sunk, and compensation for the widows and dependants has been taken at the average of 600Z. per death (see paragraph 22). The cargo on board was valued at 976Z.; interest on this sum up to the 31st October, 1916, would amount to 36Z. 12s., and thereafter to 4Z. Is. 4d per month.The total amount of damage done to the four fishing vessels is reported at 237Z. 16s. 2d. Compensation for loss of profits while they were having the gears refitted may be taken at l.,326Z. (see paragraph 32).47. The aggregate claim arising under this section of the Report amounts to 62,016Z. 8s. 2d., and thereafter to 1,944Z. Is. 4cZ. monthly.of a solatium in respect of each British, subject who was killed. Compensation in this form would partake more of the nature of an indemnity than of payment of claims, and therefore falls outside the sphere of the Committees duties. The total number of passengers who lost their lives through the illegal sinking of British passenger ships up to the 31st October, 1916, was : British, 824. Allied, 50. Neutrals, 168.41. Claims to the amount of 115,0141. had been filed with the Foreign Claims Office up till the 31st July, 1916, by survivors among the passengers on board British passenger liners improperly destroyed. These claims include those for effects lost, but the amounts have in many cases not been verified by statutory declaration.Claims for Destruction of Requisitioned Enemy Ships.42. Among the vessels for which claims have been included were seven enemy ships detained in British ports at the outbreak of war and subsequently requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government. These vessels have been included because, even if an obligation should remain with His-Majesty&apos;s Government on the conclusion of peace to restore them to their owners (see Part II of the Report, paragraph 61), this would not affect the liability of the enemy Government for the improper action by which they were destroyed.Total Claims under Sections (0) and (D).43. The aggregate of the claims arising out of the improper destruction by submarines and mines of British merchant vessels and fishing vessels, so far as can be reckoned at present, may be estimated at 71,937,993/. up to the 31st October, 1916, increasing by 2,164,581Z. 3s. bd. per month after that date. There is also a non-recurrent item of 79,013Z. 0s. bd. in respect of profits and interest on ships and cargoes in cases of ships damaged before that date, but of which the repairs were completed after that date.

Ships in Ports of their Enemy at the Outbreak of War.48. QUITE apart from the claims dealt with in Part I, Section (A) of this Report, arising in connection with British vessels illegally prevented by the enemy from leaving his ports before war broke out, a considerable number of ships on both sides found themselves at the outbreak of war in enemy ports in the normal course of their business, and several enemy vessels entered British ports in ignorance of the outbreak of hostilities.49. The number of such British vessels in German ports was 51, in Austrian 1, in Turkish 5, in Bulgarian 0. The number of German vessels in British ports was 106, and 22 entered port in ignorance of the outbreak of war. There were also in British ports a large number of smaller enemy craft, such as dhows, lighters, tugs, &amp;c. In addition to the above there were 21 Austrian and 60 Turkish ships in British ports, but no. Bulgarian.Particulars are given in Schedules (K) to (M).These figures exclude non-trading vessels, such as yachts, and vessels held by the Prize Court not to have been in port in the normal course of trade : all such vessels were condemned.50. An attempt was made at the Second Peace Conference in 1907 to determine the rights and duties of belligerents with regard to enemy ships present in their ports at the outbreak of war or subsequently entering them unaware of hostilities. The conclusions arrived at were embodied in the &quot; Days of Grace&quot; Convention (Hague Convention No. VI). The terms of this treaty are obscure, and its interpretation has been a constant source of difficulty during the present war.51. Great Britain, Austria, and Germany were all parties to this Convention; Turkey, however, was not a party, and consequently no question of claims by or against His Majesty&apos;s Government can arise with regard to Turkish vessels. Those in British ports when Turkey joined in the war were liable to condemnation, and in most cases condemned in accordance with the rules in existence prior to the Convention, and the five British vessels in Turkish ports may be assumed to have suffered a similar fate.52. There was one British vessel in an Austrian port at the outbreak of war : she was allowed by the Austrian authorities to depart, and did so.53. The facts with regard to Austrian vessels in British ports are as follows : By Order in Council of the 12th August, 1914, and by the announcement of the Secretary of State dated the 13th August, 1914, Austrian ships, except certain classes such as vessels over 5,000 tons, were allowed days of grace.Twenty-one Austrian vessels were in British (including oversea) ports. Of these, twelve subsequently departed, seven were sentenced to detention: the total tonnage of the latter was 32,510. The Committee have no information as to their value. Of the other two vessels, one, the &quot; Recina,&quot; was being built, and was retained by special arrangement made by the Admiralty with the owners without Prize Court proceedings; the other, the &quot;Attila,&quot; was given a pass and allowed to leave, but brought back to a naval port by one of His Majesty&apos;s ships and there held; no prize proceedings took place. Under special Admiralty arrangements, these two ships have been put to use under the British flag. His Majesty&apos;s Government must expect that, in respect of the &quot;Attila,&quot; as well as in respect of another Austrian steamer, &quot;Bathori,&quot; which was given a pass by the French Government to proceed to a neutral port, but while doing so was sunk by one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, heavy claims for compensation will be put forward.54. A list of the fifty-one British ships in German ports will be found in Schedule (K). Their total tonnage is 121,483 gross. Their value at the beginning of the war is estimated at 946,925L This value is the insured value under the Government scheme in the cases in which the ships had been so insured, and in the other cases is based on an estimate by a firm of ship valuers.It is not known which of these fifty-one ships have been requisitioned by the German Government, and very little information appears to be available as to their present condition.PART II.
The general opinion among British shipowners is that the ships have not been cared for, and it isbeleved that in some cases the enemy have stripped them of copper and other valuable metals which they contain, and of which the enemy were in need.55. The facts with regard to German ships are as follows : By the announcement of the Secretary of State on the 7th-8th August, 1914, under the Order in Council of the 4th August, 1914, permission to depart was refused to German ships on the ground of lack of reciprocity.The German vessels in British ports or entering such ports unaware of hostilities after war began were all sentenced to detention.   The numbers are as follows : United Kingdom ports, 66 vessels of a total tonnage of 69,828. Overseas, 34 vessels; tonnage, 129,313. Egypt, 6 vessels ; tonnage, 29,986. Entering British ports unaware of hostilities, 22 vessels; tonnage. 77,662. Aggregate tonnage, exclusive of lighters, dhows, tugs, and other small craft, 306,789.All these German vessels have been requisitioned and put into service by the British authorities. Some have since been lost by marine risks and others sunk by the enemy. Only a few of these vessels have been appraised, and the Committee have no information as to their aggregate value.56. The &quot; Days of Grace &quot; Convention provides that ships which are not allowed to depart are to be restored after the war. The question whether the Convention operates with regard to German ships is stated and discussed in some detail in the Appendix at &apos;the end of this part of the Report, the Committee having thought it-better not to encumber the Report itself with such discussion, but only to. state the position briefly, and to set out the conclusions at which they had arrived. For the purposes of their Keport, they have assumed that the provision which entitles a ship-owner whose ship has not been allowed to depart to the return of his ship (unless requisitioned) at the end of the war is applicable to this case.57. Some of the enemy ships requisitioned by His Majesty&apos;s Government have been permanently requisitioned and others temporarily, that is to say, for the period of the war only. Bat even if a ship has been permanently requisitioned, His Majesty&apos;s Government may, in their discretion, return the ship to the owners at the end of the war. Permanent requisition differs from temporary only in&apos; that it gives the requisitioning Government a choice at the end of the war between&apos; the return of the vessel or the payment of compensation for her non-return.58. Correspondence has passed between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government as to the proper interpretation of article 2 of the &quot;Days of Grace&quot; Convention in regard to the standard of care of a detained ship required of the Government which detains her, and it has been agreed between the two Governments that the article imposes upon the detaining Government merely the duty of safe custody. The Government must protect the vessel from pillage, but it is not responsible for damage clue to age and disuse, and if it incurs expense in maintaining a higher standard of care than is required by this interpretation of the Convention or in the insurance of the vessel, the expense so incurred forms a proper claim at the end of the war against the Government whose flag the vessel flies, that Government being left to reimburse itself from the owner.59. Discussion has taken place between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury, and the Board of Trade as to the condition in which the owner of a detained vessel is entitled to-have her restored if she is restored, and also as to the rights of the owner if the vessel is requisitioned.60. From the correspondence the Committee infer that the proper interpretation of the article is as follows : (1.) If a ship is detained but not used, the detaining Government is responsible only for the safe custody of the vessel, as explained above. The owner is entitled at the end of the war to have his vessel returned to him in the condition in which she would be if the standard of care defined had been observed. If the vessel is in a worse condition, the owner is also entitled to the sum required in order to place her in the condition in which she . ought to be.(2.) If the vessel has been requisitioned and used, then the requisitioning Govera-ment has at the end of the war a choice between two courses : (a) To treat the requisitioning as permanent. In this case the obligation would be to pay the value of the vessel at the end of the war in the condition she would
have been in if she had been laid up throughout the war and the duty of safe custody complied with. (6) To treat the requisitioning as terminating with the declaration of peace. In that event the owner is entitled to the return of his ship. If the ship is returned in such a state that she is worth less than she would have been worth if she had been laid up, and the standard of care above stated had been observed with regard to her, then the owner is entitled to money compensation, the measure of which would be the difference between the two values. (3.) No payment is due to the owner by way of hire in any ca?e whatever.As all enemy ships in British ports have been put to use by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the question dealt with in (1) only arises with regard to British ships in enemy ports.61. Of the enemy ships in British ports requisitioned and put into service by His Majesty&apos;s Government, some have been destroyed by enemy submarines or mines in a manner contrary to the rules of war. These are included in Part I, Sections (C) and (D), of the Report. The Committee are of opinion that in this case compensation should be claimed for the loss of the ships as if they were British vessels, and that, out of the money so recovered, His Majesty&apos;s Government should compensate the owners of the ship for her non-return. The Committee prefer this course to the opposite one of neither claiming nor granting compensation, not only because it is more logical, but because it will probably be more profitable to the Allies.62. Summing up the claims which should be put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to British ships in enemy ports, the Committee are of opinion that, at the conclusion of hostilities, His Majesty&apos;s Government should require the ships to be returned in the condition in which they ought to be found if the standard of care above, laid down had been applied to them. If their condition is not up to this standard, they should be accompanied by a sum of money sufficient to make them so. On the other hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to repay the cost of any higher standard of care which may prove to have been observed by the enemy Government, such as keeping the vessel insured or painted, or turning over of the engines. If the ship is no longer in existence, or has been permanently requisitioned by the enemy, the claim under the Convention should be for a sum of money sufficient to replace her. .63. The Committee have felt bound in this part of their Report to assume that effect would be given to the &quot; Days of Grace &quot; Convention, but they observe from the terms of the Admiralty letter of the 8th September, 1916, which has been communicated to them, that in the opinion of the Lords Commissioners it would be unreasonable that the enemy should be given the benefits of the Convention. In this event it will be necessary that the matter should be dealt with in the terms of peace.64. If His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to obtain the return of the British ships detained in German ports while imposing upon the Central Powers a waiver of their rights to a return of their ships in British ports, it will probably be convenient to treat the Convention as having been in operation, despite the reasons which might be adduced to the contrary (see Appendix). In this case the treaty of peace should contain a definite waiver by the Central Powers of all benefits to which they are entitled under the Convention. The enemy ships seized in British ports were all made the subject of Prize Court proceedings, and the orders made by the Court left the Crown liberty to apply for their condemnation at a later stage. This will enable the matter to be reopened before the Court and an application made for such an order as may be deemed appropriate.65, If His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to allow Germany to keep the detained British ships in the same way that the enemy ships in British ports are to be kept, it will probably be convenient to treat the Convention as not having been in operation, and to obtain the condemnation in the Prize Court of all enemy ships in respect of which detention orders have been made. In this case the treaty of peace should provide for the mutual retention of vessels as if they had been condemned in the Prize Court.66. The total tonnage of enemy vessels detained under the Convention by His Majesty&apos;s Government is 339,299 and that of British vessels detained under the Convention by the enemy is 121,483.
APPENDIX.The Applicability of the &quot;Days of Grace &quot; Convention as between Great Britainand Germany.The Sixth Hague Convention, relative to the status of enemy merchant ships at the outbreak of hostilities (commonly known as the &quot;Days of Grace ,; Convention), provides as follows :-Article 1. When a merchant ship of one of the belligerent Powers is at the commencement of hostilities in an enemy port, it is desirable that it should be allowed to depart freely, either immediately, or after a sufficient term of grace, and to proceed direct, after being furnished with a passport, to its port of destination or such other port as shall be named for it.The same applies in the case of a ship which left its last port of departure before the commencement of the war and enters an enemy port in ignorance of the hostilities.Article 2. A. merchant ship which, owing to circumstances of force majeure, may have been unable to leave the enemy port during the period contemplated in the preceding article, or which may not have been allowed to leave, may not be confiscated.The belligerent may only detain it, under an obligation of restoring it after the war, without indemnity, or he may requisition it on condition of paying an indemnity.Article 6.-The provisions of the present Convention are only applicable between the contracting Powers, and only if all the belligerents are parties to the Convention.Great Britain having ratified the Convention, an Order in Council was prepared before the outbreak of war upon the assumption that the Convention would come into operation, and providing for the fulfilment of our obligations thereunder. This Order was passed immediately on the outbreak of war with Germany, and published on the 5th August, 1914. It provided in effect for the grant of days of grace to German ships, provided the British Government were satisfied that not less favourable treatment was given to British ships in German ports. Vessels of over 5,000 tons and certain other vessels were excluded from the privilege of days of grace, and it was provided that such vessels would remain liable on adjudication in the Prize Court to detention or to requisition &quot;in accordance with the Convention aforesaid.&quot; It was also provided that if His Majesty&apos;s,Government were not satisfied as to the treatment of British ships days of grace should not be granted, and the German ships which otherwise would have received them should &quot; be liable to capture, and shall be brought before the Prize Court forthwith for adjudication.&quot;It seems fairly clear that Germany was prepared to grant days of grace pn. con-dition of reciprocity, but the period allowed for the necessary communication was too short, and the British Government were not satisfied in time as to the treatment to be given to British ships in Germany. The provisions of the Order m Council as to days of grace did not therefore come into effect.There can be little doubt that the interpretation placed upon the Convention by His Majesty&apos;s Government, both before the war and at its outbreak, was that, if days of grace were not granted under article 1, article 2 applied, and the ships were liable only to detention and restoration at the end of the war, not to condemnation. This is made sufficiently plain by the provision above quoted as to vessels over 5,000 tons, to which it was proposed not to give days of grace. Accordingly certain correspondence passed shortly after the outbreak of war between the British and German Governments, in which His Majesty&apos;s Government intimated that they proposed to act in accordance with this interpretation of the Convention, on condition of reciprocity, and it may be said that an agreement was come to on these lines.,Accordingly when the German ships in question were brought before the Prize Court the Crown asked only for an order for detention, and after some discussion a form of order was adopted and made in all similar cases, under which the ship was ordered to.be detained until further order was issued by the Court. The effect of this [401] N
was to leave the matter open, and the rights of the parties to be decided by the Court at a later date.By the time the question came before the Prize Court doubts had been suggested as to the applicability of the Convention. It was suggested that article 2 was not obligatory, and only came into force in the event of days of grace being granted under article 1. It was.also pointed out that Serbia and Montenegro not being parties to the Convention, it was not strictly applicable under article 6, as between Great Britain and Germany. The President mentioned the latter point in the case of the &quot;Moewe,&quot; and expressed the opinion &quot; that it would, accord with the traditions of this country if the non-adherence of Serbia and Montenegro and Turkey were not allowed to prevent the operations of the Convention and of the other Hague Conventions, all of which include a similar provision.&quot;Both these points were discussed before the Privy Council in the case of the &quot; Gutenfels.&quot; It was decided by the Law Officers not to rely on article 6, if that was the only point on which the Court was prepared to allow the appeal, and in delivering judgment Lord Wrenbury said: &quot; The Law Officers of the Crown have stated in the plainest terms that the British Government abide by The Hague Convention, and look to&apos; Germany to do the same.&quot; The second point, as to whether article 2 is obligatory, was not decided by the Privy Council, their Lordships holding it impossible to do so in the absence of knowledge of the future attitude of the respective belligerents as to the interpretation of the Convention.The position, therefore, is that the exact effect of the Convention is undecided, and so far as the Prize Court is concerned the fate of the vessels in question remains to be decided at the end of the war. To this extent His Majesty&apos;s Government have a free hand, subject to the view taken of their obligations under the Convention and the correspondence which passed with the German Government at the beginning of the -war.It should be added that, so far as is known, the British ships in German ports have not been made the subject of prize proceedings, the detention being merely executive.It is of course possible to provide in the terms of peace that, irrespective of any rights which Germany may possess under the Convention or the correspondence, her detained ships shall not be restored to her, while she is compelled to give back the British ships which she holds. If it is considered that such a course might involve a repudiation by the British Government of their obligations, it is suggested that there are two arguments, based on events which have taken place since the signing of the Convention and the correspondence referred to, which would justify His Majesty&apos;s Government in taking the action suggested.The first is that Germany has in her action at sea entirely disregarded, whenever it suited her to do so, her obligations under Conventions to which she was a party, and also the laws of humanity, which have hitherto been universally recognised in naval warfare. Germany cannot be entitled to claim the benefits of a Convention which it suits her to observe while entirely disregarding those which fettered her belligerent activity, and her action since the correspondence in question took place is sufficient to release His Majesty&apos;s Government from the obligations which they undertook at a time when Germany&apos;s methods of warfare were as yet undisclosed.The second argument is that it is known from instructions issued by the German Government to their diplomatic and consular representatives in neutral countries, which were intercepted by the French authorities, that the German owners of ships which had been detained and requisitioned by the Allies in accordance with the Convention proposed to make an attempt, in the event of any such ships entering neutral ports, to recover possession of them by process of law, and that the German representatives were instructed to afford them every&quot;assistance with this object. As the right to requisition is expressly given by the Convention, it is clear that Germ any was prepared to disregard even this Convention in cases where it suited her to do so, and therefore she may be said to have abandoned any rights that she might possess under it, so that His Majesty&apos;s Government are free from any obligations which might otherwise be conceived to attach to them.
