From the First Sea Lord.mormum of snippine in theI have received the enclose messoranauss from the Chief of the Imperial aeneral Staff, and desire to bring the matter before the War Cabinet.It is guite evident from reeent experience that the Admiralty is no longer able to safeguard adequately the communications of the armies in Salonica and Egypt. During the period April 1st to April 13th inclusive 20 BrittttoShips of a total of 81,000 tons have been sunk in the Mediterranean, exclusive of two large transports sunk within the last 48 hours, and it is . right that the aabinet.should be made aware of the .Admiralty view that the oo^sunications are no longer reasonably safe from submarine attach *The opening of the land route from Cherbourg to Taranto when accomplished will shorten the sea route in the Mediterranean to Salonica by rather more than one-half, but even if this relief were afforded immediately the recent announcement by the Germans of their intention to attack hospital ships more than counterbalances this gain.I am therefore convinced that, owing to the entirely inadequate force which can be provided to safe-guard the Mediterranean line of communications, It is essential that the Salonica expedition should be modified by the immediate reduction or withdrawal of the British contingent.
If $here were any prospect of the war finishing during Wlf$ and if any great advantages were to be obtained by merely reducing the British contingent by one-half, it might be worth while.to run the risks inherent to a policy emtm&amp;yttig this reduction only? but, as there seems to be ne prospect whatever, in view of the situation in Russia, of the war being ended this year, and bearing in mind how essential It is for the continuance of the war during 19 IB that, we should at once commence to build up a large reserve of wheat, I strongly urge that the British contingent be entirely withdrawn.   Three results would accrue **(1) we should be able to afford much better protection to our ocnmioatione for the Army in Egypt?(0) we should gain a number of patrol craft for safe-guarding our commerce in home waters; and(3) we should free a large amount of shipping to be used for building up a reserve of food and for supplying our allies with coal aad other necessaries.In the Admiralty War Staff paper dated the 19th April, the extremely grave shipping situation was clearly indicated by the statement that the accumulative deficiency in imports into the United Kingdom for the current year as compared with the year 1910 will be 9 million tons even after deducting the 6 million tons saved by the recently approved reduction In imports.17th April, 1917.
Wsa? Office, S0W.The first Sea Lord, Admiralty,You know that the War -Oabinet proposes to submit to the Imperial War Cabinet a resolution to the effect that     should bo prepared to continue the war into 1918 *    The Admiralty has already represented that owing to the shippings situation Bom reduction in the secondary theatres of war is necessary,, and there has been much verbal discussion on this subject at di.f-f erent times.    It seems to me, in view of the hostile submarine activitythat the time has now arrived for the matter to be definitely placed in writing before the War Cabinet, m&amp; m authoritative representation made as to what reduction is tuv cessary in the near fixture in order, to enable us to eontinue the war into 1918.It is reasonable to hope that the campaign in Sast linos will be completed this Susser, kit the amount of shippi^f thereby released will not be great0    Owing to the situation in Russia it 1$ mr$ doubtful whether the Russian forces will be able to co-operate to any appreciable extent with our troops who are now fighting the Turks, and, if they cannot0 no reduc-tion in Mesopotamia will be possible,, while you are aware of the importance which the War Cabinet attaches to the vigorous prosecution of the campaign in Palestine 0    In France our forces are not likely to decrease, and we may hope they will increase.There reiaains only the Salonika oanipaiga to bo considered, and the effect on.shipping of the rstireaeii of the Allied forces to such a position as could be held without the Britiih contingent, and the consequent withdrawal of that contingent. In this conriection you are aware that preparations are being
made to open land sosasunieationo from Cherbourg to Taranfco, but this will&apos; only deal with men and stores and will not af-f sot the transport of siek arid animalsa    I do mi know how the.opening of this route mil affect the shipping iituation, but if it will not produce the results you desire, 1 think a definite statement of the situation should be submitted by you to the War Cabinet,, and that&apos; they should be informer hi onco of what reduction in the shipping now allocated to th3- minor theatres is essential, and whether the complete withdrawal, or in the alternative a reduction., of our force at Salnrdca is necessary to enable the Army and Hairy to continue the war as the War Cabinet proposes,(Sdo)     Wo- Bo Robert son.Chief of the Imperial General Staff.  &apos;
