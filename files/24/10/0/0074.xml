S E CEET.&quot; 1 WAR CABINET.S.T. 474THE FOOD QUESTION.    &apos;(Note by Lord Robert Cecil and a-Memorendum by Mr.Herbert -Hoover.).Mr.Hoover spoke to me this afternoon about the Foodstuffs Question.He has, I understand, been appointed something like Food Controller in the United. States,  and he left with me the annexed Memorandum, the pith of which he stated to me.The proposal seems to me eminently sound.     Apart from the advantages of it to which he calls attention in the Memorandum, it will be of very great service in dealing with the food and fodder, supplies&quot;to neutrals.   . We shall all agree that, if there is any question of starvation, it is better that the neutrals should starve before the Allies;   and, even if it does not come to that, it is obviously necessary, in the face of the submarine menace, to treat the food questions of the world as one.I venture, therefore, to urge that this matter should be immediately taken into consideration by the War Cabinet, end a decision arrived at upon it.(Initialled) R.C.Foreign Office,16th.April, 1917.MEMORANDUM. -1.       It appears to me that the time has arrived when much broader, more intimate and more effective cooperation can be established among the various organs of the Allied Governments and among the different Governments themselves for the purchase and distribution of the staple food-supplies.     The entrance of tho United States into the war, the diminishing world supplies, and the growth of food control among the Allies all afford reason for a further step In organisation.Z.       The main staples which it would appear desirable to take in hand at an early moment are wheat, maize, oats, rice, rye, barley, peas, beans, sugar, meat and fats.     The important producing centres having surpluses for export are, with the exception of the Argentine, now under Allied control and are therefore now possible of exclusive distribution and use by the&apos;Allies.3.       The general outlook from now on is that the available supplies and shipping will be a diminishing rather than an increasing quantity;    that in consequence control will need tc be exercised in the allocation of these supplies among the Allies and co-operation in sale and
cur-chase between the exporting Allies and consuming Allies exercised, in order to provide necessities and prevent still further rises in prices and consequent further embarrassment 0i the consuming populations in fill the Allied countries, including the United States.4.     By degrees tne free play of merchandising has been further and further restricted owing to the difficulties of shipping and the necessity for Government support until at the present moment the staple supplies for the civil populations in Europe and for the armies have&apos;reached a considerable degree of consolidation.     Upon the other hrnd, there still exist different organs of the various governments which are rival customers for the some supply and by their inner competition are forcing, up prices beyond those due to the pressure. of short supplies.5.     The disintegrated control of supplies also represents TrJ.cn overlapping and loss in transport. - For instance, coiii-cident contracts made by different import agencies in the export countries have at times resulted in alternate great transport and port congestion at one time.and slack use of. such facilities at ether times,,     It should be possible with a central control to somewhat mitigate these wastes and delays.   -6.      In order to assure regularity and quantitative dis-tribution, It is desirable to.formulate long in advance the quantitative requirements of the importers, the resources of the exporters, and therefrom the allocation of both imports and exports among respective parties.7.       It appears that the first,step towards better co-operation is the early creation of an International Board which shall have somewhat the following functions:(a) .   The creation of&quot;.organs for the consolidation of the purchase of each of the principal staples.This&apos;is no doubt most easily/accomplished by the further elaboration and strengthening of the already established very efficient organs.,  such as the Wheat Commission, whose operations on behal*f of the whole of the consuming Allies would be practically complete if the supply&apos;of the army were added to their functions.      Such organs already partially exist for some staples and need creation in others,     Obviously all such organisations should produce as little disturbance in regular Commercial activity as possible.(b).       The determination of total quantities available fromdifferent quarters and their,allocation among the Allies. Some system of export permits will probably need creation among all Allied exporters.(c) The co-ordination of supplies so as to get the best results both from the point of view of geographic dis-&quot;tribution and of economy and regularity in transportation.(d) The determination of future needs so far as may be possible in order to stimulate production in all quarterson lines.which aill remedy the deficiencies and effect eaee of transport.
(g)     The allocation of surplus imports beyond Allied needs among neutrals in such manner as will through the appropriate agencies secure equivalent return in shipping or other commo-dities   from each neutral-thus supplied.,.(f) To organise publicity upon the needs of the importing Allies with a view to stimulating effort from the exporting Allies.(g) To correlate food transport to shipping necessities.(h) From a strictly American point of view the centralisation cf buying of any particular- staple in one set &quot;of hands will promote the regulation of prices, and a knowledge;of the amount of f cod-stuffs   required by. the Allies will promote&apos; any action which.may be taken by the American Government, with a view to control prices stimulation of production, reduction of con-sumption of special staples or the substitution of other&quot; American products for them so as to&apos; free such staples for export..    It is my impression that the., large rises in prices during, the last few-months have been due in considerable measure to. the rivalry of&apos; different Allied organs;in the American markets..    For the stimulation of American production it is desirable that seme guidance-should be given to the American people; as to the character of cereals to be planted&apos;.&apos; .   In the direct and Indirect, control of American consumption a great deal can be done by the way of substitution.in home consumption, for instance- the extension of the consumption of maize breadin the United States for wheat bread and thus   the production of a larger wheat surplus for export.     At the present moment it is of  course - impc sslble for me to- say what measures cf price.control or restriction on consumption may be undertaken in the United States but whether any- such measures are under-taken, or nets it appears to me that the erection of such an organism as that outlined above is .the essential necessary before any adequate cooperation can- be entered into by the United States..  8&apos;b   It would be the aciwa of success if as a result of -cooperation the necessity-of rationing the civil population In- Europe could be avoided with its - attendant consumption of man power expense and social difficulties.HERBERT HOOVER14th April, 1917
