Printed fur the War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET. /- ,  . ; Jj9i am Us 1APPRECIATION BY LORD HARDINGE ON THE NOTE BY THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF, DATED MARCH 29, 1917.THE pith of the note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff is to be found in the last two paragraphs, which, summarised briefly, advocate that in view of our disappointment at the small contribution made by Russia, Italy, and Roumania towards winning the war, our agreements with those countries should be submitted to review, and that, in consideration of the improbability of the aspirations of these three countries ever being realised, &quot; we should no longer allow our hands to be tied to &quot;the same extent as before, and that we should secure greater freedom to take &quot; advantage of any opportunity that may arise for detaching from the Central Alliance &quot; those members of it who may desire peace on reasonable terms.&quot;An important question of principle is thus raised in which practical advantage is found to be in conflict with moral obligation. It is not stated in the agreements concluded that the Allies Avill carry, on the war until their respective aspirations have been attained, but the realisation pf these agreements at the conclusion of peace is implied, and that consequently war will continue until this result has been secured.Our agreement Avith Russia for her acquisition of Constantinople and the Straits is based on the condition that the war is carried on and brought to a successful conclusion, and that the desiderata of Great Britain and France in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere are realised ; while, on the other hand, the acceptance by Russia of British and French proposals relating to Asia Minor and Arabia is made dependent upon the achievement of Russia&apos;s aspirations relating to Constantinople and the Straits.There is little doubt that the prospect of the acquisition of Constantinople and the Straits the secular ambition of Russia since the days of Peter the Great has been the main incentive so far in deciding Russia, in spite of her tremendous sacrifices and losses, to continue the war, and under no circumstances to listen to the repeated overtures of Germany for a separate peace. The suggestion that Russia might be satisfied with the internationalisation of the Straits is in direct-opposition to Russian policy and declarations in the past. On the many occasions when this question has been raised, Russia has invariably made it clear that she would prefer the maintenance of the status quo, by which Turkey remained the janitor of the Straits, to, any scheme by which the fleets of foreign Powers would have free access to the Black Sea. The advantage to Russia of the Straits being under the guardianship of a weak naval Power such as Turkey are obvious, and the only possible improvement upon such a situation from a Russian point of view would be either that the Straits should become a Russian possession, or that free ingress or egress should be conceded to Russia but denied to all other Powers. Any proposal, therefore, to reduce the claims of Russia owing to her failure to accomplish all that was expected of her might be fraught with danger, in that it would remove the only incentive likely to encourage her to devote all her energy and resources to the successful prosecution of the war. It must not be forgotten that the acquisition by Russia of Constantinople and the Straits, thus driving a Russian wedge to the Mediterranean between Europe and Asia, is the one point in Russian foreign policy which clashes hopelessly with German aspirations and with the German dream of an Eastern Empire stretching from the North Sea to the Persian Gulf. Russians already conquered by her arms most of the zone she claims in Asia Minor, and it is not likely that Germany would oppose any obstacles to her retaining possession of such Turkish territory as would not clash with German schemes. There remains, therefore, only Russia^ demand for an outlet to the Mediterranean, of the need of which she has had a very bitter experience during the present war, and if this aspiration is denied to her there is no apparent reason why a separate peace between Germany and Russia should not be negotiable on easy terms for Russia, except for the [491J * B
engagement not to conclude such a peace given by her in the Declaration of London of the 5th September, 1914 Consequently, it would seem to be the right policy on the part of the Allies to continue to support as far as possible Russian aspirations in order to secure Russia&apos;s continued participation in the war, whether they may ever he realised or not;; such a course would:practically.close the door to any negotiations for peace with Turkey in which the cession of Constantinople and the Straits is included.On the other hand, the Provisional Government in Russia appear to be divided in their views as to the aims of Russia in the war. The Minister of Justice has made a speech in which he disclaimed for his country any idea of territorial expansion, while the Minister for Foreign Affairs has declared that he will not permit the Allies to modify the agreements already concluded. With a view to reconciling conflicting views in the Russian Cabinet and to reassure Russian pacifists, Prince Lvoff, the Prime Minister, has issued a stirring proclamation calling upon the people to deliver their country from the invader, making, at the same time, a declaration of the foreign policy of the Government, and the aims of Russia in the war. For the sake of clearness these lines are &quot;quoted textually as given in the &quot; Times &quot; of the 11th April: &quot; The Government deems it to he its right and duty to declare now that free &quot; Russia does not aim at dominating other nations, at depriving them of their national &quot; patrimony, or at occupying by force foreign territories; but that its object is to &quot; establish a durable peace on the basis of the rights of nations to decide their own &quot; destiny.&quot; The Russian nation does not lust after the strengthening of its power abroad at &quot; the expense of other nations. &apos; Its aim is not to subjugate or to humiliate anyone.******&quot; These principles will constitute the basis of the foreign policy of the Provisional &quot; Government, which will carry out unfailingly the popular will and safeguard the &quot;rights of our Fatherland, while observing the engagements entered into with our &quot;Allies.&quot;Although it may be possible to read any interpretation into this statement, the first impression given to the reader is that the policy of the acquisition of Constanti-nople and the Straits, and even of the permanent occupation of those regions of Asia Minor now held by Russian troops, is renounced, but that the engagement given by Russia to the Allies not to conclude a separate peace will be respected. A new policy based on these lines gives rise to fresh considerations.The withdrawal of the demand for the cession of Constantinople and the Straits to Russia removes the one great obstacle to the possible detachment of Turkey from the Central Alliance. It is possible that the grip of Germany upon Turkey is too strong to permit her breaking away. Still it is not impossible that, were it generally known at Constantinople that the Allies would be ready to come to terms with Turkey on equitable terms, a revolution would break out there, and the leading military clique would be either killed or expelled. Feelers for peace have already been put out by Turkish authorities in a responsible position. It is unnecessary to discuss here what the possible terms of peace with Turkey should in that case be, but it may be pointed&apos;out that the fact that Russia had voluntarily renounced her own claims would in no way release her from the obligation of supporting the claims of her Allies as formulated in the agreements concluded with her. The advantage of even the benevolent neutrality of Turkey towards the Allies would be inestimable, since not only would it release some hundred thousand troops from Egypt and Mesopotamia, but it would open the road to the provisioning of Russia and Roumania through the Black Sea., It seems very desirable that the Russian Government should give the Allies as early as possible, a. clear and definite pronouncement upon their attitude towards the question of Constantinople and the Straits and of the permanent occupation of those provinces of Asia Minor now held by Russian troops.By the second article of the Agreement concluded on the 26th April, 1915, between Italy and Great Britain, France and Russia, Italy agreed to employ the full measure of her resources in pursuing the war in common with France, Great Britain, and Russia against all their enemies. Of the remaining fifteen articles of this Treaty, thirteen contain concessions to Italian aspirations comprising territories of enormous extent where Italy has not been able to send a single soldier to vindicate her claims
which, in many cases, are of a very illusory character. Italy has also adhered to the declaration of the 5th September, 1914, in which an engagement is taken not to concludeseparate peace with the enemy.It can hardly he assumed hy the warmest admirers of Italy that she has employed her full strength in prosecuting the war, or that her effort has been commen-surate with her claims to territorial compensation. Austria is Italy&apos;s enemy, and, except for claims in Asia, which are so far undefined, it is at the expense of Austria alone that she can obtain the territorial expansion that she covets, Still it is known from an indirect yet official source that Italy would be satisfied with the Trentino, the territory now occupied by her troops on the Isonzo frontier, together with Trieste and the northern islands in the Adriatic.   It is possible that even theseiglit be reduced by the creation of a free port at Trieste. There need be no fear of Italy concluding a separate peace with Austria, for, as we know from Count Mensdorff s recent conversation at Berne, Austria is bitterly hostile to Italy, and would never agree :o the concessions that Italy demands. Except in the event of the unconditional sur-render of Austria and Turkey, Italy&apos;s claims in Austria are irreconcilable, and in &apos;urkey unreaiisable. There would be no advantage in entering upon negotiations with Italy for the reduction of her claims, since to do so would probably only tend to reduce her effort in the war, while it might impose a moral obligation upon the Powers to )btain for Italy her reduced demands.nvThe situation of Roumania is tragic in the extreme. It was only after Europe ad been for two years convulsed by war that Roumania entered into the^ struggle, onsiderable pressure was put upon Roumania, more particularly by Russia, to join be Allies, the negotiations being carried on by General Alexieff and the Russian igation at Bucharest. In view of the reports of the military attache of His Majesty&apos;s egation at Bucharest as to the unprepared condition of the Roumanian army for war, is a matter of some surprise that so much anxiety should have been, shown to (tain the adhesion of Roumania to the alliance of the Entente Powers. After long egotiations, an agreement was concluded between the Roumanian Government and hose of the Allies, and signed on the 17th August, 1916.According to the first article of the treaty, the Allies guaranteed the existing ontiers of Roumania, and by the second article Roumania pledged herself to declare ar and to attack Austria, and at the same time to cease having economic relations ith all the enemies of the Allies. Article 3 of the treaty- recognises the right of oumania to annex a very large slice of Austrian territory defined in the following rticle, while article 5 stipulates that Roumania will not conclude a separate peace with lie enemy, and states that the four Powers, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Russia, e an engagement that the territories defined in article 4 shall, in the Treaty of eace, be annexed to the Roumanian Crown.It is hardly necessary to recount here the blind confidence of M. Bratiano that no ttack by Bulgaria need be apprehended, the invasion of Transylvania, the declaration, war by Bulgaria, the Bulgarian invasion and capture of the Quadrilateral and of the )brudja, followed by the retreat of the Roumanian armies and the evacuation of allachia and the greater part of Moldavia. It is a disappointing history of muddled &apos;ategy and incompetent leadership.The position of the Allies vis d-vis Roumania is an uncomfortable one. Not only lave they guaranteed the inviolability of her former frontiers, but they have pledged liemselves to secure for Roumania in the Treaty of Peace a large accession of territory it: lie expense of Austria-Hunga^, which she had &quot;invaded and from which she was xpelled with serious losses. As in the case of Italy, as stated above, it will be Possible, only in the event of the unconditional surrender of Austria, to obtain the nmexation of the territories claimed by Roumania. The Allies are still a long way i&apos;om securing the restoration of Roumania&apos;s former frontiers that they have guaranteed, flrile the restitution by Bulgaria of the Quadrilateral, wrested from her by Roumania it a moment of complete exhaustion after the Servian war of 1912, presents lifficulties of a moral as well as of a practical kind. If, in the course of time, t may be.possible to restore I.!oumania&apos;s former frontiers, and to reconstitute her wnmercial and economic prosperity, the Roumanian Government and people may lien realise that their ambitions, largely owing to their own shortcomings, are jiiattainable, and may release the Allies from their obligations. Still, it would be iesirable to endeavour to obtain for Ptoumania, in the Treaty of Peace, a rectification &apos;f her frontier so as to include the most Roumanian part of Transylvania, and, if [491: *      B 2to
possible, autonomy for the Roumanian districts incorporated in Hungary. In tJi meantime, it would not.seem desirable to make any suggestion to Roumania, in tli sense of a reduction of her claims, until a concrete proposal has been made b\ Austria or Bulgaria for a separate peace presenting a reasonable prospect o acceptance.Having discussed the possible reduction of the territorial claims of Russia, Italy and Roumania with a view to not allowing our hands to be tied to the same extent a before, the question remains what members, if any, of the Central Alliance desire t conclude a separate peace on reasonable terms.There is no doubt that Austria, in the first instance, is most anxious for peace and the feelers put out in Scandinavia in February were no doubt genuine, but the; came to nothing owing to the German Emperor having heard of them ; and since hi visit to the Emperor of Austria at Vienna and the honours that were heaped upon th latter, it&apos; is now openly announced that Austria will not make peace apart iron Germany. It is more than likely that the Emperor of Austria was persuaded i keep quiet until the effect of the submarine campaign had been proved. Never theless, Count Mensdorff was reported a few days ago to be in Switzerlant patiently waiting for a meeting to discuss terms of peace with a Frenchma or an Englishman who never came a pathetic picture. It is not impossible, however that with the satisfactory progress of the war the attitude of Austria will change, ant that she will again be ready to negotiate a separate peace.The inherent difficulties of such a negotiation owing to the pretensions of Italj and Roumania have been explained above, but they need not be regarded as insur mountable, and if very moderate concessions could be made acceptable to Italy ant Roumania, and if Galicia were added to the Polish State, Austria might well bn satisfied with a federation of the four autonomous States of Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and Jugo-Slavia, under the personal sovereignty of the Emperor. Bosnia and Herzegovina would naturally have to be excluded from such an Empire. Such a solution might, if a guarantee ol: the support of the Allies were given, create a powerful barrier against the German &quot;Drang nach Osten.&quot;In the previous part of this note the advantage of the detachment of Turkey from the Central Powers has been shown. According to our information, Turkey also is awaiting the result of the submarine campaign, and is the most ready of the enemy Powers for peace. If, as seems to be -the case, Russia has renounced her claim to Constantinople and the - Straits, negotiations for peace need present no serious difficulties.Within the last week a paid emissary, sent by the Turkish Minister at The Hague, has been in London with a view to sounding the feeling in England, in general terms, as to a separate peace with Turkey. From what he told his interviewer, the TurkisL Minister at The Hague had suggested some form of British Protectorate of Turkey, but had recognised at the same time that the Hedjaz, Bagdad, and Armenia were lost to Turkey. If such is. really the frame of mind of the Turks, it should not be a difficult task to detach them from the Central Alliance, provided always that Russia has renounced her claim to Constantinople and the Straits.Lastly, there is the case of Bulgaria, whose population, if our information he correct, is thoroughly war-weary and disgusted with German tutelage.   Her case k particularly difficult to deal with, owing to Servian and Greek rivalries, and to the fact that Bulgaria has made good her military occupation of practically all the territory to which she^ aspires.   We know that advances have been made to M. Miliukoff, whos Bulgarophil sentiments are well known; but the question would arise with whom t treat, for the treacherous character of King Ferdinand is so notorious, that it would b folly and a waste of time to deal with him.In making peace with Bulgaria, it would be essential to remember the importance of effecting a. permanent settlement of the various rivalries in the Balkan States with the - view to establish a durable peace. Consequently, it would not be a wise policy for the Allies to treat the Bulgarians with the harshness they deserve. Means of satisfying Bulgarian aspirations must therefore be found. It would in al probability be idle to think of peace with Bulgaria at present under conditions which did not guarantee to her, at the least, that portion of the Dobrudja, as far as the former Bulgarian frontier shamefully wrested from her by Roumania in 1912, Drama, Serres, and a free port at Cavalla, the uncontested zone of 1912, and an undertaking to support a return to the Enos-Midia line. It is not to be anticipated that, even if such terms should prove acceptable to Bulgaria, her army would consent to fight ob
the side of the Allies, but a benevolent and guaranteed neutrality would result in the cutting of Turkey&apos;s communications with t-he Central Powers, and be of manifestadvantage to the Allies.Any apparent hardship caused to Servia by such terms should find compensation in the absorption of Montenegro and the annexation of the provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina.At present it cannot be said that any definite advances for peace are being made (vhich present any bope of success, but the policy of the Foreign Office is to be watchful and receptive, and while the appreciations contained in this note may be regarded as temporary and constantly liable to change, the question of terms of peace, ffhen it arises, can only be determined by the circumstances of the moment, and the situation created by the latest developments.H. of P.April 12, 1917.o
