DURING- the past two months the situation in Greece has centred round the question of the continuance of the blockade and the execution by the Hellenic Government of the demands con-tained in the Allied ultimatum of the 8th January.* As compared with the incoherence of the previous period, the results achieved during January and February are not wholly unsatisfactory. We have obtained formal reparation for the events of the 1st and 2nd December, the majority of the Venizelists imprisoned by the Athens Government have been released, and the Greek army has been eliminated as a serious military danger. Moreover, the decisions of the Conference of Rome appear at first sight to have produced a quieting effect upon General Sarrail It is true indeed that the French occupied Mount Athus without our being consulted, and that the attitude of General Cauboue in connection with the military controls has been somewhat truculent, but it can scarcely be said that the French have in any essential respect deliberately evaded the decisions of the Rome Conference.On the other hand, the situation, as it stands to-day, contains the elements of further complication, and it would he dangerous to suppose that the Greek problem is now finally-settled, or that an: even closer co-ordination between the Allies is not necessary for the future.The difficulties with which we are now faced, and which may at any moment attain serious proportions, may be divided roughly under three heads: 1. Difficulties connected with the interpretation of the Alliedultimatum of the 8th January ; 2. Difficulties which have since arisen between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government; and 3. Difficulties inherent in the existing iuternal condition ofGreece.The first are, perhaps, of no very essential importance. The second are important chiefly as creating an unfortunate atmosphere of friction ; whereas those coming within the third category require early definition and consideration if further grave complications are to be avoided. .(1.) Difficulties connected with the interpretation of the Ultimatum of January 8.It will be convenient to subdivide this category under two headings: (a.) The constitution of the Military Commission appointed to control the number of Greek troops and material evacuated to the Morea ; and(b.) The question of the maintenance of the blockade and the conditions which the French Government desire to add to the original demands of our ultimatum before they will consent to the blockade being raised.As regards (a), it will be remembered that the French Goverh-ment insisted from the first that General Phillips should be placed* bee Appendix IV. [383] B
under the orders of General Sarrail, and that thev endeavoured bv this and other means to secure that the Allied Governments should be informed only through the medium of the French Commander-in-Chief of the manner in which the evacuation was proceeding.It was, indeed,- soon apparent that the French Commissioner, General Cauboue, was determined to place a most pessimistic inter-pretation upon the progress of the evacuation, and the whole question has suffered from the fact that the two Allied Govern-ments were faced with divergent, if not contradictory, reports on the manner in which this essential condition of the ultimatum was being- fulfilled.It may be added, indeed, that the French officers went further than this. The Greek Government asked for certain minor conces-sions, the more important of which was the retention in Northern Greece of a certain proportion of garrison troops necessary for the maintenance of order in the provinces. These concessions were recommended as reasonable bv the Military Attaches and the Allied Ministers, but were summarily rejected by General Sarrail. The point is important, as it will enable the Greek Government to disclaim responsibility in the event of massacres or other disturb-ances taking place in the future. It should also be remembered that the evacuation, which was to have been completed in fifteen days, was spread over a far longer period, and it is possible that General Sarrail may at some future date contend that this fact constitutes a violation of the ultimatum, and justifies the Allied Powers in regarding their own undertakings under that ultimatum as null and void.(b.) As regards the maintenance of the existing blockade, a certain divergence has also manifested itself between the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government and that of the French Government. In this connection we are not on very clear ground. On the one hand. Sir F. Elliot, after advocating the raising of the blockade, has since adhered to the French view that it should for the present be maintained. On the other hand, the terms of the ultimatum of the 8th January are somewhat vague, and it cannot be said with certaintv whether the raising of the blockade was meant to be dependent only on a satisfactory evacuation of troops to the Morea, or whether the later ultimatum included in its scope the full execution of the demands contained in the previous notes of the 31st and 14th December.*It may be said that the view7 at present held by His Majesty&apos;s Government is that we should maintain the blockade (subject to the early introduction of a system of rationing to prevent actual starvation), so long as it can be shown that any military menace to the Salonica army still exists. The French, on the other hand, wish to go further than this, and to add to the demands contained in the&apos; original notes and ultimatum certain further conditions, such as a complete amnesty for all Venizelists, an improvement of the tone of the Athenian press, and the constitution of the Corn-mission of Enquiry into the events of the 1st and 2nd December on a basis&quot; dictated by the Allies, rather than on one concerted between the Allies and the Greek Government. This latter condition requires some further explanation: It was stated in theultimatum that a Commission should be instituted in &quot; agreement with, the Greek Government&quot; to enquire into the events of the 1st and 2nd December, and it was subsequently suggested that there should be three Commissioners only, representing respectively the British, French, and Greek Governments. The Greek Government have, however, contended, and Sir F. Elliot regains their contention as justified, that it was unfair to&apos;place the Greek representative in a minority, and that the Commission should therefore consist of four representatives, namely, two from Greece and two representing France* See Appendices II and III.
and Great Britain, presided over by a neutral umpire. The matter is at the present moment still under discussion, although HisMajesty&apos;s Government have themselves informed the French Government that they are inclined to favour the appointment of four representatives, who could, in the case of disagreement, refer to a neutral umpire.(2.) Difficulties which have since arisen between  His  Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government.(a.) Occupation of Volo as an additional base. This is largely a military and naval question, and the British military and naval authorities have refused to accept the French proposal, on the ground that it is navally impracticable, and that the military advantages to be secured are not such as to justify the naval and political objections to the proposal.In this connection it may be borne in mind that General Sarrail, who is clearly determined to secure his object, may be tempted to encourage a Venizelist rising in Volo in order to justify a French occupation by force, and it is evident from telegrams which have recently been received that the population of Volo is already showing signs of effervescence.(6.) A further difficulty which has arisen, but the full purport of which is not as yet fully apparent, is in connection with the exercise by the French of the control over Greek posts and tele-graphs. The French have taken over this control as the result of a Conference of the Allied Ministers at Athens, and are proposing, apparently, to stop all cypher telegrams passing between neutral Legations and their home Governments. The matter is being elucidated by enquiries at Athens and Paris, and is only raised here as an indication of the manner in which the French authorities tend to exploit any mandate given them by the Allied Govern-ments.(c.) A further incident, regarding which we have as yet no full details, is provided by the conversations which have passed between the French Minister at Athens and M. Stratos, a political enemy of the Entente and unfriendly towards Sir F. Elliot. These conversations evidently relate to the possibility of M. Stratos form-in g a Cabinet, but it is not known how far M. Guillemin may have committed himself, and the incident is mentioned only in case it assumes large proportions in the near future.(3.) Difficulties inherent in the Internal Situation in Greece.The complications which have been dealt with under the two above headings are not of any very essential importance, but the present internal condition in Greece is likely to lead to serious difficulty unless a clear policy can be concerted between the Allies.The main factor in the situation is that the elements with which we have to cope have shifted their identity. In 1915 our enemy was King Constantine; in 1918 it was the Greek Govern-ment and the Greek military party; and now it is the Greek armed mob, and neither King Constantine nor his Government have very much to do with the situation. King Constantine is for the present at the mercy of the forces of disorder which he has himself evoked; the Greek Government are &quot;unlikely to proceed to overt acts of hostility unless and until we suffer a serious set-back at Monastir or a grave military disaster in some other theatre; but the Greek mob, as concentrated in the reservists leagues, are inspired by a frenzied hatred of Venizelos and of those who are known to have assumed the responsibility for his support. This responsibility is scarcely one which the Allied Powers can disavow, and it is doubtful whether opinion in this country or in France would be prepared to support a tacit acquiescence in a systematic &apos; extermination of Venizelists in old Greece.
I IFor the moment, therefore, there is little likelihood of an overt act of hostility against the Allies on the part of the Greek King or Government themselves, and the dangers to be immediately apprehended are either (1) isolated acts of brigandage or sabotage; or (2) massacres of Venizelists entailing possible intervention.As regards (1), the French do not seem to be very unreasonable, and they appear, indeed, to have &apos; overlooked a recent incident in which some Senagalese soldiers were massacred by comitaji.As regards (2), hcwevpr, it is evident that farther atrocities against Venizelists are more than probable. The attitude of the reservists, the menaces which have of late been appearing in the Athens press,* the release of certain convicts by the Athenian authorities and the situation in Bpirus, all point to the early possibility of further attacks against the partisans of the Provisional Government.The question arises, therefore, as to what attitude the two Governments should assume in the event of such atrocities being committed. They can hardly remain indifferent, and General Sarrail is certain to avail himself of that or of any other excuse to plead for intervention. The problem is rendered more acute by the fact that no statesman in Athens is capable of forming a Government strong enough to cope either wih the reservists themselves or with the Greek General Staff who will, out of hatred of Venizelos, give the reservists secret support and protec-tion. It will be necessary therefore to take very radical measures, and to agree with the Allied Governments beforehand as to the exact scope and nature of these radical measures which should be taken.A severe critic of General Sarrail would doubtless argue that the General was fully aware of the position into which the Greek internal situation was drifting, and that his recent forbearance and moderation are to be explained by the fact that lie is convinced that his intervention will sooner or later be forced upon the Allied Governments. Be this as it may, it is incontestable that Ave are no longer concerned primarily with the attitude of King Cohstantine, of his Government, or of the General Staff, but that the essential danger is to be found in the activities of the reservists and the acute internal disturbances which these activities may provoke.The Russian Government, realising evidently than an element of incoherence was again obscuring Allied policy in Greece, have recently suggested that a Conference of Ambassadors should sit permanently in Home, and that the decisions of this Conference should be binding on the Allied Ministers at Athens. The latter, in their turn, would co-ordinate all their reports and actions, and refer to Rome in the&apos; event of disagreement. It has also been suggested that a simultaneous change of Allied Ministers at Athens would facilitate the resumption of normal relations with the Greek Government, to which suggestion His Majesty&apos;s Government have replied that they are for the present unwilling to remove Sir F: Elliot, in. whose judgment and knowledge they place much reliance.This is evidently a step, in the right direction, but it might be observed that the basic problem of the Greek situation is contained in the question, &quot; How is military intervention in Greece by the Allied Powers to be prevented, and at the same time the wishes of the Allies carried into effect and a normal situation restored ? &quot; It is onlyhy arriving at a previous agreement between the four Governments that these aims can be attained.-, H, G. N.Foreign Office, March.-.6, 1917.* See Appendix V. -
APPENDIX I.Draft by Mr. Half our of a Despatch to Lord Bertie of Thame.a careful study of recent events in greece has forced upon his majesty&apos;&quot;s government the conviction that there are powerful influences deliberately working for an open rupture with the king&apos;s government in greece. his majesty&apos;s government do not disguise from themselves that such a consummation may be inevitable. it may be the intention of the greek ministry to employ greek forces against the allied armies if. and when, these should find themselves in difficulties. but no such action seems to be contemplated at present; and it is safe to say that it will never take place unless two conditions are satisfied: namely, a powerful german offensive on the monastir-salonica front combined with a firm conviction at athens that germany is going to be successful in the war. nin the opinion of our general staff, war with greece would be a serious military misfortune : for it avould throw additional duties upon troops who are barely sufficient for the duties they have already undertaken. unless, moreover, it were undertaken for reasons which were plainly, even overwhelmingly, sufficient,it would lower the prestige of the allies all the world over, and. would supply a painful commentary on the allied professions of regard for the rights of small nations.it will be in your excellency&apos;s recollection that at the time when the greek government were openly working in german interests by handing over greek forces to the germans and abandoning greek territory to the bulgarians, his majesty&apos;s government were desirous of sending an ultimatum to athens, but abstained from doing so in deference to the wishes of the president of the council. now that, to all appearances, the greek ministers are making a serious effort to meet the allies&apos; demands, it seems most unwise to use no stronger term either to declare war on them or to pursue a policy which might compel them to declare war on us.his majesty&apos;8 government have made these views quite clear both to their militaiy and their diplomatic representatives in greece. your excellency should take a suitable opportunity of pressing a similar course on the minister for foreign affairs. nothing would be more deplorable than that the officials of our two countries, should pursue divergent policies in the near east. the consequences, military and political, would be evidently disastrous ; and we confidently hope that instructions will be given to all french officials in greece to carry out in the letter and the spirit the decisions arrived at bv our two governments.A.

Ils ne peuvent avoir de securite&quot; a cet 6gard que si tout le materiel et les troupes grecques (prevus dans les notes du 14 et du 31 decembre) sont transports dans le Peloponese dans un delai tres court et sans aucun doute possible. Pour assurer Pexecution oertaine et rapide il est indispensable, d&apos;une part, qu&apos;ils aient toute liberte de controle sans )a moindre entrave au depart et a Parrivee des evacuations, et, cPautre part, qu&apos;ils y participent eux-memes par leurs moyens maritimes afin que dans un terme de quinze jours tout soit executee en toute loyaute et sans contestation possible.

GUILLEMIN.BOSDARI.DEMIDOF.WILLIAM ERSKINE.APPENDIX V.Telegram No. 425 of February 15, 1917, from Sir F. Elliot.(Urgent.)CONTINUED hints in Royalist press that a storm was brewing and individual threats of reservists that another 2nd December would soon, take place in which an end would be made of Venizelists have now culminated in something like a panic at Athens. Date fixed for new movement is said to be Sunday, the 18th February. Some sixteen persons came separately to legation yesterday to give this information and to ask advice. Severalhave withdrawn to the Pirasus for safety. Excitement is inflamed by statement in the press again that authorities have discovered a scheme for an insurgent lauding at Pirasus, and have taken necessary steps to prevent it.   Story is obviously absurd, but it may serve as an excuse for bloodshed.o
