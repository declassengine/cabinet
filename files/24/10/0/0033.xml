French proposal to invade Thessaly.Invasion of Greece &quot;by the Allies presumably entails a state of war with that country.This by itself necessitates an extension of Naval Operations in the form of a complete blockade, not only against merchant vessels, but also against tho use of Greek ports as submarine bases, with an increase in the Naval Forces required.In addition, new bases, probably at Salarais or the Piraeus and Volo, would have to be established for the Army, &apos; -and our commitments in tho Eastern Mediterranean thereby largely increased.The effect- of tho submarine campaign, and of the^opera-tions of desultory raiders, on the mercantile fleet is such---trat in order to maintain the supply of essential articles required by the Allied nations, it is&quot;quite certain, as has already been stated in connection with other proposed military operations, that the demand for additional tonnage cannot be met unless preceded by a proportionate reduction in military demands for oTher s&quot;pheres.In connection &quot;with the Salonika expedition   alone it is understood from the War Office that transport for 100,000 cases of sickness from malaria in addition to wounded and pre-sumably for 100,000 drafts to replace them, will bo required during the coming summer.   The difficulties of ensuring safe coomonication by sea to Salonika, due to the submarine menace, are alroady very great and,are certain to become greater, and the number of vessels lost will naturally increase.   There is great cliffioulty in even partially meeting the demands for tonnage for carrying supplies to. Italy and France, and if further diversion of shipping for military requirements is made, the reduction of tonnage so allotted is - inevitable.It is probable that the Frenoh Government may be reckoning on the use of German ships interned in the United States and other countries, but it is not certain that the Govern-ments of those countries will permit them to be used at all, or if they do, for anything except for their own requirements.   In  . any case, owing to the damage done to them, they will not be available for many months.At the recent Naval Conference in London it was pro-posed that an International Shipping Committee be appointed to obtain- and exchange information as to the employment of mer-cantile vessels, and It would be desirable that the information obtained as to the uso of French vessels should be ascertained in order to see if full use is being made of them to meet the existing demands, as the French are &quot;already using British vessels for their Syrian Contingent and will expect us to supply shipping for any reinforcements they may find it necessary to send to Greece.It cannot be emphasised too strongly that the task of counteracting the submarine is iririenSe and is a very serious tax on our resources.     The number of mines laid by U. C. submarines on our coasts is increasing, while the number of U boats destroyed does not, so far as can be judged, approaeh the figures for new construction.   Th ensure the&quot;safety of .troop transports,   the requirements for patrol and rain e sweeping vessels are alkready far beyond our resources present or potentialand
and tho protection now required for hospital ships can only given by leaving the transports unescorted or detaining them. The replacement&apos; of;casualties to patrol and mine sweeping vessels, duo to mines and other causes, and of vessels requiring docking . and rofit owing to arduous work is a heavy item in it self, and in place of further increasing tho numbers employed in&quot;the Mediterranean it may become necessary to reduce then.From the Naval point of view, nothing can justify any further dispersion of our efforts or any increase in our ccroft-monts outside home waters&apos;, on the contrary they should certainly be reduced.If tho proposed, policy in &quot;Greece is adopted, the following facts must be faced :-(a) An increase in tho losses of troop, transports and ofhospital ships must bo expected;(b) A reduction in the tonnage available for carryingessential supplies to Allied countries&quot;will be inevitable(c) An increase in losses of merchant vessels in Home Waterswill certainly follow if more patrol and mineswoeping vessels are detached to the Mediterranean.There is one further and still more important factor in the case.A paper has been prepared for the Committee on i,tyL&amp;rf*isuz&amp;&amp; which indicates month1 by month the cumulative deficiency in imports into the United Kingdom for the current year as compared -with the year 1916.The total deficiency reached by the end of December is estimated to be 14,800,000 tons.     If from this total is deducted the saving of 6,000,000 tons due to the approved reduction of import, we are faced with a deficiency of nearly 9,000,000.tons for the year.These figures are arrived at by taking the average loss in British shipping at 290,000 tons monthly, and by making a comparative reduction for losses in allied and neutral ships. The British total will it is feared exceed that given, and the position may therefore be even more unsatisfactory than the above figure indicates.Under such conditions it is impossible to propose any other policy than that of a very drastic reduction in tonnage commitments, combined with a concentration of patrol craft in Home Waters. .IRALTY.WAR STAFF, 12th April, 1917.
