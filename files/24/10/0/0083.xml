SUBJECT :-   Report fromBRIGADIii2-g^iMRAL-ff. 0.  001^.pijtrqgrado 9. 3* 17.p/117.0,   i.   or.   s.Herewith a short report of the situation out hare behind tho front.I have been unable as yet to get the new organisation into working order as I have no staff and no office at present. Colonel Xnox, however, is rendering me every possible assistance and is still carrying on generally until I am able to take over the supplyquestion completely.In the main the situation is as follows.1.   At ROMANOV *There is a very grave chaos and congestion. The railway seems quite unable to cope with the bulk of goods landed from the ships,, Sir Henry Wilson will report fully on the situation, so I will not give further details.     We are taking the following measures toimprove matters :-A.   Admiral Oorvin and Commodore Kemp have gone up there to deaLwith the situation as regards the shipping. Bo   Mr. Bure is going up very shortly to advise as regards the railway possibilities.   I think it highly probable that the Russians will have mado very strenuous efforts to improve matters before his arrival, so we may hope for improvement in the immediate future. C.   I am sending Major Hallward up there from Archangel as a temporary measure to act as forwarding officer on our behalf.
it2. At ARCHANGEL.I have just returned from a visit to this Pert.     There is naturally some considerable confusion there on account of the two serious explosions at ECONOMY and BAKARITZA which caused considerable damage and losses of material of all sorts. On the whole though, the situation is encouraging, Work is proceeding satisfactorily in the way of salvaging the damaged goods, and building sheds, houses for v/orkmen, and berths. At the same time, the berths where the explosions occurred will be useless for this sBason.     The result of this is that, although two new berths will be ready when the port tpens, the total number cf berths available will not be greater than was the case at the beginning of&apos;last season.I understand that the General Staff have agreed to supply 11,000 capable soldiers with suitable officers and N.C.0&apos;s to undertake the duties of unloading.   This number Is considerably less than was demanded by the Port Authorities, but it at any rate will make the situation much more satisfactory than before. If It turns out that the number is insufficient, it should not be difficult n*w to arrange fir an increase in the allowance Of men.The authorities are taking steps with regard to the safety question in handling of explosives with a view to preventing further disasters.    It did appear to m^, however, that suffic-ient precautions were being taken against wilful ince-ndiarism. I have urged *n the authorities here the necessity of estab-lishing a secret service with a view to -countering any G-erman activities in that direction.As/
As regards the transportation of goods,. I was most impressed with the necessity of having some definite plan, so as to despatch the goods in order of importance,, in place of the somewhat haphazard system nrw in vogue. , which results in the arrival cf guns r.t thoir destination while their fittings are missing and untraceable* I hopo that wo shall be able to improve matters considerably in this respect. . At TBARSKQE SBLQ.I have two officers, Capts. Ashworth and Springfield living here superintending the equipping of the 12&quot;, 8&quot;, 9.2&quot; and 6&quot; Howitzer batteries- Since their advent there has been a slight increase of activity and *bn the whole the situation is more encouraging-   The great difficulty to contend with is that, while the Russian officer will devote greater energy in learning and criticising all technical details of manufacture, yet it is very hard to work up any enthusiasm in the details of the practical us of the weapon. The predeliction for sitting in an office in place of activity on the parade ground is somewhat noticeable, particularly among the more senior ranks.Up to now., six .8&quot; batteries have been formed and have left to carry out their preliminary practice, Two 6&quot; batteries and three 12&quot;. 2-gun batteries aro also formed and will soon be ready to move.   On the other hand there has been no attempt at present to raise the fourth 12!t battery although the guns have now been there for four months.   On the whole though we have made&apos; slight progress and I hope that our influence has already gained ground.4. At MOSCOW
4,   At MOSCOW6Here we are Interested in two departments.   The aviation school under Major Valentine, and the Reserve Artillery Brigade which equips and turns out. the 60 pr. batteries.As regards the aviation?   The Russians have handed over the school complete to Major Valentine and are affording him every facility.    He hopes by the end of April to have turned out and placed on the front two complete squadrons.    In addition, as soon as the officers and men who are corning from England have arrived wo shall be able to start wireless and machine gun classes.   So far the aviation branch is the most advanced of all the work we have undertaken, and in that respect the situation may be considered satisfactory. As regards the GO prs,I have sent Major- Peacock down to take charge- -of the school,, but so far nothing has been done.    There are 8 60 pr* guns there and 23 wagons, but no fittings at all.    As these guns were despatched from Archangel on 24th. Jan. and have only just arrived, the whole state of affairs is most unsatisfactory.As&apos;regards personnel for the batteries,, the- situation is also most uncatisfactoryr.There are no officers for the batteries, no horses, no harness and apparently no organisation -whatever.   I have taken this matter up strongly and I am assured that it Is now being rectified.    If only the authorities would display the same energy in turning&quot; out batteries as they do in justifying \.thelJ?..J3ije^thods . we . should,,see&apos;a marked^ advanc-e .in.-eff ic-iancy.
5,   Trench Mortars.All arrangements are made for a Trench Mortar school&apos;s establishment here as soon as possible - when the officers and N.C.O. instructors arrive from England-.    1 think there will be no difficulty in working up enthusiasm in favour of the Stoke and 2&quot; Trench Mortars in principle,   A greater will no doubt arise when the question of starting manufacture -of mortars and bombs out here .is definitely tackled.   So far my efforts in this direction have met with, small encourage ment.   I hope I may get over it though by utilising the War Industries Committee; I have talked to the President here who leads me to believe that they will be able and willing to undertake manufacture,6-.   General.As far as the general question of raw materials is con-cerned the situation is not encouraging.   There seems to be; - v &apos;-.y&apos;;,,-no doubt that the output of coal, steel and copper io steadily diminishing.   Prom all one hears the same story that the two causes which militate aga inst improvement in this direction are1,   Disorganisation of the railway system- with the result of shortage of rolling stock and Curtailment of/transport facilities-,2,.   Dislocation of labour - through an indiscriminatecalling up, of skilled workmen^It is possible that, now that the Russian Government are giving closer attention to these subjects we may see an improvement before the end of the year.As regards the copper question, it turns out that on the 1st, February there were upwards of 4,000 tons of copper,
F.C. P00LE,Brigadier-General, Commanding Military Equipment Sectionin Russia.lying ready at different works throughout the country and only held up for want of transport.   This fact has been brought to the notite of the Minister of War and I understand that the necessary steps are now being provided to transport this metal.     The great difficulty in this Industry Is the necessity of a regular supply of fuel to the smelters, which involves in the case of the Ural and Caucasian groups a railway journey of 1500 - 1600 miles.
