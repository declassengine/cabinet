BOARD OP TRADE OUOBANOT -^^y* Resolutions of the Paris EIs Economic Conferencesc^rhe Resolutions adopted at the Paris Economic Conference of the Allies, other than (A) those relating to common action during the war in respect of trading with the enemy and the restriction of enemy supplies, fall into two groups, namely(B) Transitory Measures for the Period of Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural and Maritime Reconstructioncf the Allied Countries, and(C) Permanent Measures of Mutual Assistance and Collaboration among the Allies,,The Resolutions under the heading (B) were &quot;fcased on two propositions: first, that the conduct of the war, by the Central Powers and by &quot;Germany in particular, has shown a determination to do everything possible to prevent or at least retard seriously the economic recovery of the Allies - by the sinking of merchant shipping, the destruction of works and factories in the invaded territories and the carrying off of large quantities of plant and raw materials; and secondly., that the Germans were known to be organising their industries for an aviack upon the Allied markets, and for a vigorous effort to recover their position in neutral markets, immediately after the war whilst the Allies woilU be engaged in restoring their pre-war economic organi-sation and making good the destruction wrought in Belgium, Northern Prance, Russian Poland and Serbia.The policy laid down in tie Resolutions under this heading is directed towards the acceptance of joint responsibility for the restoration of the invaded territories, and common action to prevent the Central Powers crom reaping the advantages ex-pected by them from the course of action which has been indicated above.   It was not directed against neutrals^ In the preamble to the Resolutions the Conference specifically declared that as against the-------------
German policy of eco-nomic domination the Allies aimed at securing &quot;for themselves and for the whole of the markets  . of neutral countries full economic independence and respect for sound commercial practice&quot;, and in the course of the dis-cussion as to the conservation of Allied resources for illied requirements after the war, the British Delegates expressly stated that in determining the measures to be adopted for that purpose the Government of the United Kingdom must take into full account its commercial treaty obligations to Neutral Powers.-&apos;It should be added that the length of the Reconstruction Period was nowhere defined:   in the Resolutions relating to the withholding from the Enemy States of the right to most-favour-ed nation treatment, and to the treatment of &quot;enemy&quot; goods and shipping, the periods of time (not necessarily identical) for which the special measures contemplated should be in force were left to be settled  by diplomatic action at a later date.The Resolutions   included under heading (c) - &quot;Permanent Measures&quot; lay dov/n two principles: . (l) the necessity of action by the Allies to prevent a recurrence of their depen-donce upon the present enemy states and especially Germany, for commodities essential for the maintenance of their mili-tary and industrial efficiency - a policy which by increasingbethe sources of supply shDuld/advantageous to neutral countries also;   and (2) the promotior of closer trade relations be-tween the present Allies by&apos; the improvement of the means of transport and communication and the assimilation so far as practicable of the laws relating to patents and trade marks. The Resolution with regard go improvement of trade relations by the provision of better transport facilities was adopted with special regard to the cases of Russia and Italy, and theextent/
Upas;:       ulB^VVaHBHBYJHRextent to which their produce had hitherto gone largelyto Germany*    It may he pointed out that there is not in theResolutions, and was not at tho Conference itself, any refer-ence to any Inter-Allied preference in respeot of CustomsDuties,The following are notee on the separate Resolutions included under headings (B) and (0);i.    ine Allies declare their -common dete-rmina.- .. iion to ensure the re-establishment of the countries suffering from acts of destruction., spoliation and unjust requisition, and decide to join in devising means to secure the restoration to those countries as a prior claim, of their raw materials, industrial and agricultural&apos;plant, stock and mercantile fleet, or to assist them to re-equip themselves in these respects.&apos;Ihe Resolution was intended to refer primarily to Bel-gium and Serbia, but it was deliberately drawn in termsbroad enough to cover the restitution of plant, machineryand stock to the occupied and devastated portions of Franceand Russia, and of the British and Allied merchantshipssunk, by German cruisers and submarines *B.II.    Whereas   the war has put an end to all the treaties of commerce between the Allies and the Lnemy Powers, and whereas it is of essential importance that, during the period of economic reconstruction which will follow the cessation of hostilities, the liberty of none.of the Allies should be hampered by any claim nut forward by the Lnemy Powers to most-favoured-nation treatment, the Allies agree that the benefit of this treatment&quot; shall not be granted to those powers during a number of years to be fixed by mutual agreement among themselves,During this nf.--.ber of years the Allies undertake to assure to each other so far as possible compensatory outlets for trade in case consequences detrimental to their commerce result from the application of the under-tcking referred to^in the- pre*vedingj?axagraph,
The effect of this resolution is to hind the Allies not to grant the right to &quot;most favoured nation&quot; treatment to the present enemy Powers either in any treaty of peace or in any other way during a number of years after the war to be fixed by agreement among the Allies.        The purpose of the Resolution is to secure complete freedom for the Allies after the war to make such commercial arrangements among themselves cr with neutral countries as they may think advantageous and expedient, without being hampered by the obligation to extend to the present enemy Powers any conoessions which they may see fit to make to present Allies or to neutrals.It is to be noted that this particular Resolution does not lay down any principles as to the actual customs or other treatment of German trade; it only prohibits the Allies - from binding themselves to give to Germany and the other present enemy Powers the right to the best treatment which they give to other powers.Its adoption would not prevent any one of the Allies fr from making special tariff arrangements with Germany as to particular commodities should it be found expedient to do so; it  -ould only prevent Germany from securing during a certain period   a right to general most favoured nation treatment - : a right which, as established over against Prance by the Treaty of Prankfort had proved very-onerous for the latter country.The second paragraph of the Resolution, binding the Allies to ensure to each other so far as possible compensa-tory outlets for trade in cases where the trade of any one of them should be adversely affected by the action taken,  v was adopted to meet the objections of the Russian and Italian delegates, who were reluctant to pledge themselves otherwise to a course which might prevent them from obtaining the admission of their agricultural produce to the German market on the easiest terms possible after the war.
B.III.    The Allies declare themselves agreed to con-serve for the Allied countries, before all others, their natural resources during the Thole period or commercial, industrial, agricultural and maritime re-construction, and for this purpose they undertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate the inter-change of these resources.In support of this Resolution it was pointed out that in the case of a number of important commodities there is a large amount of evidence that the Germans are already rnak-ing attempts to obtain in neutral countries control of sup-plies of raw materials, and in view of the strenuous efforts which they will make to replenish their supplies immediately after the War, it will be necessary for the Allies to take   , every practicable measure to secure for their own use the supplies produced in their own territories and to prevent any German control such as existed in some cases (e.g. the Australian base metals) prior to tho War.    No proposals as to the manner in which the object of the Resolution could be achieved were put forward at the Conference and the problem is admittedly one of great difficulty.    In the discussion the British delegates expressly stated that in determining the means to be adopted to give effect to the Resolution the Commercial Treaty position would have to be taken into account;   and it would also be necessary for each commodity to be considered separately.B.IV.     In order to defend their commerce, their in-dustry, their agriculture and their navigation against economic aggression resulting from dumping or any other mode of unfair competition the Allies decide to fix by agreement a perioa of time during which the commerce of the enemy powers shall be submitted to special treatment and the goods originating in their countries shall be subjected either to prohibitions or to a special regime of an effective character.The Allies will determine by agreement through diplomatic channels the special conditions to be impos-ed during the above mentioned period on the ships of the enemy powers,
This resolution was based on the belief that on the conclusion of the ITar the industry and shipping of the Allied countries would be in many respects very seriously handicapped as against German industry and shipping owing toi*&apos;(1) The destruction wrought by the German invasion in Belgium and the industrial districts of Northern France and Russia;(2)   the systematic carrying off into Germany of much industrial plant and machinery;(3)   the extensive adaptation of industrial plant in the Allied e-ountries for munition purposes;(-;.)   the handicap to which the Allies&apos; (and particularly British)shipping will be subjected immediately after the 7ar by the destruction of merchant shipping by the submarine campaign, the use of merchant shipping for the return home of troops (especially British and Colonial troops) and supplies, and the refitting and the repair of ships used during the rJar for transport purposes.   It was evident from what had appeared in the German trade papers that the Germans were cou nting on these factors to impede the industrial and commercial recovery of the Allies and they hoped, to be enabled thereby to resume the economic penetration which had been going on before the T?ar,Farther,   in various Allied countries industries had developed during the War which were of essential National importance, and it is desirable to prevent these from being swamped immediately on the restoration of peace.The precise measures to be taken were left to each Allied Government to decide for itself;   but reference was made, as regards goods,   to the possibility of special duties or surtaxes on German goods and as regards shipping
to the possibility of differential port and harbour dues andthe exclusion of German and Austrian shipping from Alliedports for a period after the conclusion of the War.B.V. The Allies will -evise the metres te bo taken jointly or severally for preventing enemy subjects from exercising, in their territories., certain industries or professions which concern national defence or economic independence.This Resolution (proposed by the French) leaves verywide latitude to each of the Allied Governments, whichcares to decide for itself as to the professions and in-dus tries to which the contemplated restrictions shall apply.The French Government appeared to have in mind mainlythe prevention of espionage.0.1. The Allies decide to take the necessary steps v/ithout delay to reader themselves independent 01 the enemy countries in so far as regards the raw materials and manufactu. ed articles essential to the normal developement of their economic activities.These steps should be directed, to as-sure in the in-dependenc, of &quot;the Allie:- not only s*j far as concerns their sources of supply, but a-lsc as regards their financial, commercial and maritime organisation.The Allies will adopt the methods which seem to them most suitable for the carrying out of this resolu-tion, according to the nature of the commodities and having regard to the principles which goTsrn their economic policy.They may, for example, have recourse either to enterprises subsidised,, directed or controlled by the Governments themselves, or to the grant of financial assistance for the encouragement of scientific and technical research and the development of national industries and resources;   to customs^duties or rohibitions of a temporary or permanent character or 0 a combination of these different methods,&quot;whatever may be   the methods adopted, the object aimed at by the Allies is to increase production within  -their territories as a  whole to a sufficient extent to enable then to maintain and develop their economic position and independence in relation&quot;to enemy countries.
This resolution prescribes a definite object to be aimed at by all the Allies (namely, independence of present enemy countries as regards esson ial industries) to be attained by each of them by means of any or all of a variety of :. methods constituted to their special circumstances.-The experience of the ..er has shown that in respect of a number of important manufactures which are essential for war purposes or for the carrying on of large brandies of national industry, the allied countries had allowed them--selves to drift into a state of dangerous dependence upon potential enemies.   Obvious and familiar examples in die United kingdom are Synthetic Dyes, spelter, Tungsten (for High Speed oteel), Optical and Chemical Glass, Magnetos (for all kinds of motor engines) and many V/;r-Synthetic Drugs; the cutting off of supplies of these and other commodities very seriously affected both our military and industrial efficiency.   As regards actual raw materials, our dependence on German sources of supply was not very marked except in the case of potash salts; &quot;out there were ca^es ix which German finance had secured for German industry the control of supplies of raw material in the Allied countries aid thei e is evidence that efforts were being made to extend that control.   Similar conditions have prevailed more or less in all allied countries^^ince the outbreak of ..ar much has been done in various directions to ::emeiy this state of affairs, but &quot;8a.-
Gonference was unanimously of opinion that unless there isto he a reversion to the pre-War conditions of the depend-ence on enemy supplies much State action will be necessaryto stimulate further efforts and to safeguard the essentialindustries against the severe competition likely to bedirected against them by the -Germans in the efforts torecover their forme:: dominant position.   It was recognisedthat the methods to be adopted could not be uniform;that a kind of State aid which would be quite effectivein one country might be of little avail in another and thatthe special circumstances of each case would requireseparate consideration.   Consequently absolute freedom wasleft to each Government to adopt whatever measures itmight deem expedient acid compatible with the principlesgoverning its genera] economic policy.C.IJ.   In order &quot;to permit; the interchange oftheir products, the  Allies undertake to adopt measuresfor facilitating their mutual trade relations bothby the establishment cf direct and rapid land and seatransport services at low rates, and by the extensionand improvement cf postal, telegraphic&quot;and othercommunications.This Resolution is really a pendant to the last paragraph of Resolution B II, which pledges the Allies to endeavour to make up for the loss of the enemy markets by developing alternative outlets for Allied products;   whilst it recognises the desirability of closer trade relations between the Allies generally;   it has special regard to the position of Russia and Italy, for hoth of which countries the Q-erman market was before the War of very great importanceThe measures contemplated by the Resolution for improving the trade relations of the Allies are not of a fiscal character, but relate only to the provision of better facilities.for transport and communication^
C.III.   The Allies undertake to convene a meeting of technical delegates to draw up measures for the assimilation, so far as maybe possible, of their laws governing patents, indications of origin and trade marks.In regard tc patents , trade marks and literary and artictic copyright which have come into &quot;existence during1 the war in enemy countries, the Allies will adopt; so far as possiblet an identical procedure, to be ap-plied as soon as hostilities cease.This procedure will be elaborated by the technical delegates of the Allies.This Resolution was based on some proposalsprepared by the Board of Trade for the treatment inthe Allied countries after the&apos;war of Patents, TradeX- *Marks and Copyright originating in enemy countries during the war.   The assimilation of the Laws relating to Patents and Trade Marks whilst very desirable, is a matter of great practical difficulty, but it is possible that some advance in that direction may be made as a result of the Technical Conference recently held at Paris in pursuance of this Resolution.12th April 1917.
