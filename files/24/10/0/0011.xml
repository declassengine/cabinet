Their natural and legitimate anxiety is well reflected in the preamble to the Resolutions of the Conference * Which sets forth the guiding motives of the detailed Policy adopted.     The three salient statements in the preamble say be recalled; ;      &apos;The Central. Empires are /to-day preparing in o oh cert with their JUleei -for.&apos;!s contest-lh:-the:eoonomic plane, which will not only Sry lve the - re-es$ablishneht-; of peaoe,, but&apos;will at that moment &amp;tajn its full scope -&apos;and :&apos;tnt ens 1 ty,The agreements which are-&quot;being prepared for this purpose ^jeen their enemies- have the&apos;obvious object of establishing the ^nation of the iatter ofrer the production and arkets of the ijole worM,and of imposing; on other oountriea an intolerable
The Representatives of the Allied. Governments consider that it has become their duty, on grounds of necessary ,and Jaegiti-mate defence, to adopt and, realise-from now onward all the measures requisite - on :the one hand- &quot;to-- secure :fof&apos; themselves and for the whole of. the markets, of neutral countries full economic independence and, respect for sound commercial practice and,, on the other hand, to, facilitate the organisation on a permament -basis, of their economic alliance.. At. that time, when, the preamble was framed, the state-ments made in (1).and.(S) were no douht thought to be justified by..the f act a...and the &apos; enemy policy embodied In them had considerable prospects of realisation.   The Resol-,utio.ns of the Conference -which were adopted iri response to it we re...there fore, rightly described as based on &quot;grounds of necessary and legitimate-, defence!&apos; - defence against commercial aiiaa,..methods and principles .on the part, of Germany which had been pursued,for many j-ears,prior to the War and had been carried, to their ;f.ul..lest.. extent, during the war itself.-  To-day,. - however,. the situation is ..-e ry, different, the changes may be summed up as follows:- . .The entry of the United States and other neutrals into the War and-the alienation, of other neutrals from Germany.The -change -in -the. military situation.   The prospects of the continuance of the present German economic control over&apos; the, non-German ^territory, in Eastern Europe and Itfearer Asia-still-remaining in.German hands are .considerably reduced.The apprehension .that the Central -Empires will be able-at. the moment ;of. peace to renew the contest on the economic plane in Vits full scope and intensity&apos; need no longer be entertained.    There is ample evidence to show that ,t.he Central Empires are. nearing. the end of their stock of
foods-tuffs end raw materials and that, even if the blockade dees not (as one dare not anticipate), by itself bring about a collapse, of their power, the moment of peace will find the German and   Austrian. authorities faced with the gigantic and unprecedented task of restocking those countries for theprimary needs, of their populations.      he difficulty and complexity of the problem thus presented is thoroughly -realised, as their recent utterances show, by the responsible German authorities (see &quot;vaper II on plans,for Gorman reconstrue-tion) - involving as...it does an elaborate organisation for the. demobilization of industrial workerst the importation of foodstuffs and raw materials,, the regulation of shipping, and the provisi on:of credit as against an adverse foreign exchange. To put it at its lowest, many months must elapse before German manufacturers will be able to produce on a large scale for export or to compete as previously, with their rivals in the markets of the WorldoThe faris Conference, in discussing the re-establish-ment of Allied countries overrun by the enmy, recommend that those countries should have a prior claim on their1raw materials, industrial and agricultural plent, stock and mercantile fleet&quot;, forbearing.to suggest that this need might be met, in whole or in part, by indemnities extorted from the enemy.     (In this connexion it is worth while drawing attention to the fact that  resident Wilson, in announcing that the United States seeks no indemnity for herself, seems to imply a demand for an indemnity for other countries wrongfully attacked).5o   The ... *
5/    The prolongation and extension of the War, with its immense, demand for material of all kinds and its diversion of labour from ordinary productive employment has changed the economic .outlook in a manner r;hich could not have been predicted even a year ago.      Whereas at the time when the Conference net the dumping of manufactured goods could be held to be a danger, the chief element in the situation to-day is a probable world-shortage for seme time tc come in important raw materials, and foodstuffs, accentuated by the recent bad harvests of last year and by the increasing shortage of shipping.  . (Thus a situation has been created which calls for concerted.action among the Allies not so much to defend themselves against German aggression as to provide oo-opera-tively rather than competitively for their own post-war needs *If. this conclusion bo correct there i^rould appear to be a strong case for a reconsideration of the problems cbn-si&amp;ered at Paris and of tho methods suggested for dealing with them.There are circumstances attending the reception of the Resolutions of the Conference themselves which tend to the same conclusion.The final   Resolution emphasizes the necessity of immediate-action.by the   Allied   Governments *for giving full . and complete effect1 to the.policy embodied in the preceding Resolutions.     Subsequent events however have shewn that the policy has proved less acceptable than was anticipated to some of the Governments concerned and that the difficulty of ad-justing its execution to the exigencies of their respective interests has not proved easy to surmount.At the Conference itself Japan ?/as the only one among the Allies to make any reservations, alleging special conditions and her geographical position as her reason for doing so.     The Russian Government, however., subsequently madeimportant ...
\l -5-important reservation, to which it adhered in spite of the protest of Great Britain,  stating on November 20 th&apos;, 1916 that :while associating herself in general&apos;with the decisions of the Conference,  she reserved to herself the right of being enabled to diverge from them in Cases where their application-was in conflict with the direct interests of Russia&apos;.   The Italian Government has made no express - reservation but it i. must be remembered that at the time when the Conference was held Italy was not yet at War with Germany and that the economic interdependence between the two countries is so close that the ItalXian Government has not found it possible,  even since the declaration of War with Germany,  to refrain from permitting the export to that&quot;Country of a&quot;large portion of the fruit crop.&quot; which forms&apos; the staple of&apos; &quot;South Italian trade.    The Belgian Government, again, has made no&quot;reservation, but it is well-known, that the proposal to place obstacles in the way of the transit trade between Antwerp and Germany,  which cannot fail to rewound to the advantage of Rotterdam,  raises&apos; grave apprehensions among important sections of Belgian opinion. The importance of the transit trade between Belgium and Central Europe under pre-war conditions, and the extent to which&apos;Belgium stands to lose by a.realization of the Central Europe plan and the consequent lowering of the Tariff between Austria-Hungary and her eastern and southern neighbours, may be judged from the fact that in the last pre-war year, 1913, Roumania exported almost twice as much merchandise to Belgium as to any other country (Roumania,  exports to Belgium  7,281,116,&apos; to Austria-Hungary  3, So4, 329,  to Germany  2,096,302) while in 1912 the. same was tine of Bulgaria (Bulgarian exports to Belgium  1,073;712.  to Austria-Hungary  620,912,  to Germany  983,352). France again, has made no reservations, but her future commercialrelations
relations with Germany must depend Very largely on the settle-ment of tho question of Alsace-Lorraine, which can ho now more fully discussed than a year ago.     In the United Kingdom the subject has been under discussion by the Commercial and Indus-trial Policy Committee        under the Chairmanship of Lord Balfour of Burleigh.     The Committee has not yet finished its work, but in making suggestions in an interim report on one of the most important matters raised in the Resolutions - the restric-tion of exports during the transition period - it states em-phatically, what indeed follows from the nature of the case,., that rwithout the full consent and co-operation of the Governments concerned, it vdll not be possible to carry the Paris Resolu-tions successfully into effects1     This full consent and co-operation .^s has been seen, it has not beenpossible to secure, owing to the divergent interests end different geographical position of the various Allies,It is true that the. Paris Resolutions attempt to meet the . difficulties and hardships involved for individual Allies in the refusal of most favoured nation treatment to Germany   by laying do?m that   1 compensatory outlets for trade1&apos; should be provided by the other   Allies in such cases..    But this provision has in its turn roused considerable sp prehension-; among neutrals, since it would in the natural course be qarrred&apos; out at their expense...    It is sufficient to ^recall the debate in the American Senate on this subject.     The smaller neutrals,, such as Holland and Switzerland, harbour similar anxieties.The question then arises what form a reconsideration of the policy under discussion should take.     It is, suggested -(1) that Lord Balfour of Burleigh*&apos;s Committee should be asked to reconsider the problem of- post-war commercial policy in the light of the &quot;changed international situation and the attitude. t.o?;ards the Tar is recommendations of the Powers referred to above.2,     5hat ...
*ylgs(2) That since the U.3.A. were not a party to the Paris Cbnfer-ence they should he sounded as to their views upon the coliect-ive policy, if any,  to he adopted after the War.(3) That subsequently it should he considered whetheradiscussion between the Powers engaged against Germany witha -view to the Adoption of a post-war enbnomic policy in accord-ance- with existing circumstances would be desirable-. - -It- is not proposed in this Memorandum to attempt to set forth-in detail- what- subjects-might profitably be discussed&apos; at&apos;-such&quot; a-meeting..-, As has already -been said,  the main task -before ;the Conference,  in so far as Ita deliberations relate &quot;to the post-war period-, would -be-- tp&apos;-enable, the Allied so, to . organise, their plans&apos; and resources as-to-provide co-operatively rather than- ccmpfctimely for their own-- post-war needs.    If,- as has-/already:..been suggested,-., the -subject.-of indemnities should also be discussed,  this might if desired,- lead- on -to a discus-sion of the problem of post-war credit and financial resources generally. -.;.-&apos;...-The most urgent subject for deliberation would however,  as at the earlier-Conferences very properly remain the concerting.of a Joint economic policy for the prosecution of the ..war itself.   This/whole subject is,- of course,  outside the scope of Reconstruction: but. it may not be held irrelevant to refer briefly to one. topic which may arise for consideration because-it is ultimately connected with the.study of post-war. conditions which has been assigned to the Committee.&quot;- It. ma be found worth, while . to consider,&apos;very carefully the bearings Cf the prospective-post-war situation &quot;for the enemy upon his general policy and morale during the - War-itself .-   As has       .; already been staged,. the German-authorities are gravely pre-occupied with the unprecedented problems that, milst-arise in therestocking
restocking of their country with foodstuffs, live stock, and industrial raw materials.   The entry of the United States into the War jeopardizes the plans which they have undoubtedly formed for securing large supplies from that country at the moment of peace.   The concentration cf such an enormous mass of economic power on the side of the Allies place at their disposal a leverage of policy of which it may be found possible to make skilful use in.influencing the.enemy.;  Whilst it is mot within our province to explore this, suggestion further, it seemed inadvisable to pass it over,, since, in Germany no less than in this country, war and post-war questions are too closely connected in the public mind to be wholly dissociated in any general review of the situation./   See accompanying prints   G.T. 409,and 4&amp;0 .11th April, .1917.
