Tho question of the acquisition from Spain of Ceuta and some of the surrounding territory in exchange for Gibraltar has been brought before the Committee,. who realise that considerable political advantages in our relationship with Spain might accrue from such- a transfer.     But tho Naval and Miliiary responsibilities involved are of so highly techfcieal a character that the Committee do    lot feel themselves competent to make any definite recommendation on the subject.   Thoy would urge, therefore, that consideration of the question in all its bearings should be undertaken without delay.
