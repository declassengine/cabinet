SECRETIMPERIAL&quot;,, -WARG.T. 448We have no?/ reached a point in the war at which it has become necessary to define more precisely to ourselves what is the relative importance to the British Empire of the objects for which we are fighting,  and. what is the irreducible minimum which we must secure at ail costs before we can possibly consent to an any peace.     Ear one thing, it js clear that we must at any rate envisage the possibility of a limited success - one which while securing the main objects for whi^li we entered the war, may yet fall considerably short of that complete and crushing victory which we still hope to achieve - and that even that limited success may involve efforts and sacrifices far greater than any we have yet anticipated.

B ^-B.      -&apos;thoroughly into this question, and laid down a definite policy for the guidance of those who are responsible for the conduct of the war&apos; and of British diplomacy, both during the war and at the Peace Conference,In order to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion we must first of all have a clear conception of the general aims and objects of British policy, and of the German policy which it is our task to frustrate.     We must also take into account the conditions, naval, military and   economic, under which the settle-merit will have to be made and; maintained.     We can then proceed to consider the relative importance of the various objects in
p. g - 9fatdispute, not only to ourselves &quot;but also to our Allies and to cur opponents, in order to ascertain the order in which they may be attainable in proportion to the degree of military success achieved, and to.form an idea of the effort still required to secure even the very minimum conditions of a tolerable peace.The object of British policy can still be defined, as Pitt defined, it in the great Revolutionary War, by the one word &quot;security&apos;1 - the maintenance of such external conditions- as will permit the peaceful development of British institutions.     Everi, &apos;. - aisince the 15th century British statesmanship has abandoned all territorial ambitions in Europe and has been consistently opposed to a Continental policy for its own sake-     But England could never afford to be wholly indifferent to Europe.,     With her small area and limited population she was always apprehensive cf one of the great military powers of Europe acquiring such a control of the wealth and shipbuilding resources of Europe as to enable it to defeat her at sea and then crush her by invasion or starve her.   To forestall this she has always joined other European Powers in resisting any attempt at a European domina-tion.This policy has often been described as that of the &quot;Balance of Power&quot;t     But the description is inadequate and may even be misleading,     In the first place it tends to convey the impression that a particular means employed by British policy is in itself the end of that policy,  and to suggest that the object of that policy is at all times and under all circumstances to maintain an artificial balance of-forces in Europe, irrespec-tive of the actual attempts at domination which have from time to time led to the adoption of this specific expedient,     In the second place it conceals the fact that the &quot;Balance of Power&quot; in Europe was only one part of the whole policy,  of which the ok;k&apos;&amp;r and more important part - at any rate after war had
actually come about - was the use cf British sea power tc strike at the enemy&apos;s oversea sources of strength, or points of vantage and menace, and to incorporate them in the British system. From the British point of v&amp;sv the really important outcome of the Seven Years War was. the removal of the French menace from North America and the East Indies.    The Dominion of Canada and the Indian Empire are the fruits of that struggle:    no one except the professional historian knows or cares whether France lost or gained European territory in that war, or how the European balance stood in 1763 beyond the fact that France was too exhaust-ed to dispute our over sea conquests.It is this continuous creation of new sources of power in new worlds oversea to redress the balance of the Old World which is the really characteristic feature of British policy, and accounts for the fact that an essentially defensive policy has led to the acquisition of so immense an Empire.     And now that Eritish policy is no longer the policy of an island immed-iately adjacent to the coast of Europe, though drawing economic strength from oversea possessions, but that of a commonwealth of communities whose actual home is at the four corners of the earth, the importance of the oversea, or oceanic aspect of that policy is necessarily even greater than in the past,Prussian policy has differed fundamentally from British both in its aim and in its methods,     &quot;Power&quot; has been the Prussian watchword as &quot;security&quot; has been that of England. England&apos;s conquests have been the outcome of wars into which she was forced for motives of defence.     Prussia, as a rule, has deliberately provoked wars in order to increase her power or enlarge her frontiers.     To understand her policy and its methods it is necessary to go back 200 years when the possessions T9f the Hohehzollerns consisted of three isolated patches of territory - East Prussia, Brandenburg, and certain territories
in Western Germany - each of -thorn with an-ahs^lnt-oOx-lnjiof ens4.hlo natural frontier,   To desiro to link these together^into one continuous territory at the expense of other states, and to organise the military power required to do it,.was the natural outcome of the conditions,,     To use that- power for yet further acquisitions and for &quot;roundings off-&quot; that would give more dofen-siblo frontiers and yet greater power was merely to carry on a tradition, that had become InbredoUpon tho tradition of direct conquest and annexation another political oonjepui.cn gradually de7elopedy whoso roots go back at any rate as far as- the Gorman uprising against . lapoleonw     That was the conception of Prussia as the controlling and organising state over a confederacy of smaller.states whose military and economic systems should be incorporated in hers0 Bismarck1 s - policy v s 1&amp; co&amp;Dination cf this policy with, the older Prussian policy of direct anoexation0   There was an element of each policy in tho Danish wars, in.1866 and in 187CK   After 1870 two different and essentially divergent projects gradually cams to dominate tho German minds     Tho first was the. development cf the policy of- organisation and control outside Germany, first to Austria and then to the Balkans and Turkey,   This was tho project whose watchword was &quot;Berlin to Baghdad&quot;, which looked -upon Russia as the natural onemy, and wished to secure the support or at any rate the benevolent neutrality of England, Tho other, and more ambitious project., was to use the methods of aggression and direct conquest by which Prussia had carved out for herself her military position in Germany, at the expense of the decadent Empire of the Eapsburgs, in order to rarest the heritage cf naval power and jolonial Empire from the British Empire, which in German eyos appeared to show signs of incipient decay and disintegration0Of these two projects the first was not originally and
- 5 -207inherently contrary to ridtjah-.nrrieresis; it only became so. because it vras combined with the second.    It is the attempt to run the two in double harness that has been Germany7s great miscalculation and involved her in a task beyond even her immense capacities.     As far as British interests are concerned the essential thing is to mako the second project unroalisable for good and all, and to convince Germany that it is -unreal!sable, Our concern with the first project is indirecta   Vie cannot afford to 1st it succeed to tho point of dominating Europe and becoming the starting point of a second attempt to strike sr^f the British Empire from a larger taco*   Still less can we afford to let it succeed to the point of dominating the Middle East, *- and threatening our whole position in Egypt, India and the Eastern&apos; y &quot;oseas0At the present moment the German $reject of sea power and world dominion has failed completely.   Every German naval base, and every German colony, except for a small corner of East Africa, is in Allied hands0     On the other hand tho great Middle-European project is, for the moment at any rate, estab-lished almost to the fullest extent ever dreamed by German ambitionso   Mesopotamia, it is true, is in British hands, and Palestine in imminent peril0   But on the other hand Germany holds not only Belgium, Poland, Courland, and most of Houmania and the Balkans, but also areas in Franco and In Russia, cut-side of any possible Middle-European scheme, which will serve as assets to bargain with, if she still holds them at tho end of the \var,0/This situation might be completely reversed as regards the sea power project by a German naval victory or by the complete success of the submarine -campaign.   It might equally be reversed as regards the Middle-Buropean project by the oomp.;,.te collapse of the military power of the Central Empires.
- 6 -But neither event is probable.   She submarine campaign may inflict great hardships; it may oven seriously impair our power of assisting our Allies or maintaining our ov/n oversea expedi-tions*;    it is not going to destroy British sea power or reconquer any lost colony.     She armies of tho Central Bowers must and will Be driven Back a groat deal further if any tolerable peace is to result.   But, unless actual starvation forces surrender, It is very doubtful whether the Allied armies will ever penetrate far into the Great quadrilateral bounded by tho Rhino on the Best, the Vistula and Carpathians on the East and tho Save and Banube on the -SouthoUp to this point we have traced the development of British and Gorman policy in tho past.,   But before wo can shape any correct conclusion as to tho Bind of poaco that Bribish policy should aim at, and as to the very lowost terms that must be secured before the British Empire oan afford to abandon, the struggle, it is essential to grasp,, in all their bearings, the actual lessons of the present war, in the economic as well as in tho naval and military sphere, and even more the prospective developments of the next generation as they will affect the question of the defence and economic development of the British Empire and of other States,,     It is only by a just appreciation -of the various factors that a;o to make tho world environment of yEhe future that we arc likely to be able to attain Both our own security and the permanent stability of tho settlement which wo hope -co impose at the end of tho war,Tho problems of sea power have boon profoundly affected by the experiences cf the war and will bo affected even more profoundly by the developments of the future. - It is impossible to forecast the precise effects which the submarine, the airship and -aeroplane, and the perfecting of wireless telegraphy -pes^loly even the future wireless transmission of power - will
have, on naval warfare and on the safety of sea ccmmunications. Bat there can be no doubt as to tho enormous importance as regards all those factors of fined bases:    centres of activity against the enemy1s fleets and merchant shipping;   depots for. petrol and every necessary supply;    repair centres, and last, but not least, fortified places of refuge.   In most of. those respects Germany had,.fortunately, shown but little prescience before tho i:ar, or had, at any rate, mado no full use of her opportunities.   Only as regards wireless telegraphy bad she made any effective prepara-tion for the contort in the outer seas, and ono of the chief reasons which mado the conquest of tho German colonies- imperative from the outset of the war was tho necessity of stopping the activity of thoir wireless stations,,     As it was, the groat station at Kamina in Togoland, only finished a few weeks beforo the war, and destroyed within a few days cf its outbreak., yet enabled many million pounds worth of Gorman shipping to seek, refuge, in neutral harbours *   But it may be safely assumed that- i  (JormanyN is able to recover her colonial possessions, the -South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific will In future each have their formidable submarine and aviation bases,As regards warfare on,land the factor that has dominated, the situation has been railway1 powera    To a large ontont the war has-been one of railway power versus sea power, and, within its radius, railway power has proved the more effective-,   The secret of Germany1s striking power In her great railway system, and it is through her control of the great railway arteries that she domin-ates and keeps together the Alliance- of the Central Powers., Trench warfare is, in a sense, a by-product of railway warfare. It is &apos;vhe millions, of men brought up and supplied by the railways that inake possible these continuously manned fronts over hundreds of miles, and praotieariy eliminate all mobile and outflanking : * ctics in the densely peopled regions cf Europe   It is the &quot;big
- f)guns with thoir immense masses of shells, also brought up by tho railways, which compel the opposing troops to go under ground.   To securo tho shortest possible lino of trench front with tho greatest possible density of railway communieatIons in rear, and the largest possible volume of industry and man power behind that front, must bo the obvious goal of European national strategy in the futo.ro.   It will be equally the goal of national financial policy-   She trenches of the future will be elaborate and costly fortifications extending along the whole length of a nation&quot;s frontiers0   The territorial alms of individual states, and oven more their groupings and alliances, will bo enormously influenced by the idea of shortening necessary frontiers end eliminating unnecessary one s0In competition with this mechanical conception of warfare by railway and high explosive and trench is the aspect of war which aviation has introduced.   But even here though the elemen&apos; of individual skill and courage plays an enormous part tho fount tion is the output capacity of tho national engineering industry One geographical consideration too will tend to play a very important part, namely tho advantage cf having tho main centres of national production and administration at a safe distance from the frontier.In the economic shphore the great lesson brought home by the war to every combatant and neutral is the necessity of bein self-containedB     To secure effective control of all Its vital national necessities and of all its principal industries from tho production of the raw material upward will henceforward be one of the first aims of every community that wishos to be independent in fact as well as in name,   Coimnunitios which cahnot attain this object by themselves will naturally tend to fedorato with or become dependent upon others in eombina-tion with whom they can feel seeuro0
All these considerations taken together load to a conclusion which may he unwelcome, &quot;but which has to be laced.   There is little scope in the Europe of tho future for completely independent and detached small nations.   A small nation, unless extremely favourably situated geo-graphically, has to maintain fortified frontiers out of all proportion to its resources..   Every portion of Its territory is liable to air raids by overwhelming enemy squadrons.   In the economic sphere it-will always be in danger of being frozen out or obscrbedo   The process which, in Industry, caused the workshop to be superseded by the factory, and the factory by the Trust or Cartel, has its counterpart in the process which is tending to supersede small nations by great Empires or closely associated groups.Belgium is a typical instance.   The German idea is to. restore Belgium to a nominal independence, retaining, however, a control over its ports and railways, and presumably over Its defencese     $either from the point of view of the Allies, or of tho Belgians themselves would this be a satisfactory solution.   But &apos;7hat.are tho Inevitable consequences of the liberation of Belgium by the Allies?     To leave it in the defenceless condition in which it was in 1914 is out of tho question,,   France would riot allow It and the Belgians them-.&apos;.7 &quot; - -    i      t - &apos;solves ?70ul&amp; not- desire it.   A military, treaty with Franco and Grea&apos;&apos;t Britain,,, involving definite obligations on the part of Belgium with, regard to the Belgian eastern frontier? will have to be made.   Belgium is already a party to tho Paris Resolutions, which will restrict her complete economic freedom and make her in a largo measure dependent upon Prance ana England v.   Belgium1 s only hope of getting a chance of restoring her industries and recovering her trade during tie rush of tho reconstruction after the war will be by concluding definite arrangements with the Allies for tho supply of machinery and materials and for the
marketing of nor goods,   And those arrangements, however bone-fieial to Belgium, will necessarily tend to make her permanently more dependent on tho Allies,,     It will Bo a willing dependence upon friends and Allies instead of     dependence on a tyrannous enemyn   But it will bo dependence all the same.In-the light of those considerations we ean now examine the two German policies and estimate their future prospects of success, and their relative merits from the German point of view The Middle^European policy has so far been justified in the field, and if the present /position, or anything like it, can be maintained, presents immense advantages for the future,   Tho retention of Poland and Hournania under German military and economic control would give the shortest possible frontier aero sr. Europe, and behind it highly developed industrial resources, and an admirable system of railway and river cemmunication0   The control of the Balkans practically eliminates a southern land frontier altogether and gives an admirable frontage on the Adriatic, -Aegean and Black Sea,   The control of Turkey increases this sea frontage and involves no difficult land frontier rroble: whether the whole of the Turkish Empire in Asia is recovered or whether tho frontier is drawn Back to Asia Minor,    The whole-area controlled is thus eminently defensible.   It can Be developed so as to produce all tho foodstuffs, all the petrol, and almost all the minerals and ether raw materials which the populations of the Central. Bowers can require *   Cotton ean Bo grown extensively in Asia Minor, and there are many oil yielding plants which ean be grown in Asia Minor and tho Balkans to make good, in time of war, the absence of palm oil and copra. The only tropical raw material of primary importance that would have to be imported and stored, or for which a substitute would have to be found, is rubber.The other German, policy,. that of sea power and colonial
-ill 213expansion at. the expense of tho British Empire, is, for the moment, defeated.   But if&apos; Germany can &quot;recover her Colonies, or oven aad to thorn,&apos; as she hopes, by the annexation of Portuguese. Colonies, or by tho control of the Congo, she will bo. ablo to renew it with far greater hopes of success,,   She will take effective military measures to make her Colonies secure against conquest, and she will establish in each of them bases for submarines and raiders,,     A base at Dual a in the Cameroons commanding tho routes to South America and South Africa, a baso in East Africa whose radius covered the entrance to tho Rod Soa, and threatened all communications between India and South Africa. -. -..... , i Hu -a;; &apos; - ,-&quot;&apos;.one or more bases in the Pacific - once they aro well organised tho next war with tho British Empire could be undertaken under &quot;far more favourable conditions.The. hopes of bringing this policy to a successful issue would, of course, bo enormously enhanced if it could bo combinoc with, the complete carrying out of the first policy, that, is if &quot; Germany wore able to retain hold of Belgium or of the whole of Turkey in Asia ?    In the former case tho effective ratal and aerial threat to England wculd compel a concentration of dofen-sive measures to meet it, and would improve the chances of tho attack against British oceanic communications.   In tho latter the menace from Palestine and Mesopotamia to Egypt and India would be .doubled by tho menace from East Africa.   German pamphleteers have already boon discussing the value of Bast Africa when recovered, as a support to Turkey and to Islam In Egypt, and with Germany installed at tho gates of Egypt on one side, and in East Africa on the-other, the Prussian instinct, would never rest till tho tuo wore linked up together, and the great Railway- Empire became continuous from Hamburg to lake lyasa.     German control of Palestine,  combined with a Gorman reaccuisition of East Africa is, indeed, the greatest of all dangers which can confront, the British Empire in tho future.
-1 o- xcBut If Germany cannot combine both projects and has to surrender ono, there can he little doubt which one she will moro readily surrender. . The Middle-Europoan or Railway Empire scheme is the one that promises the greatest measure of security at homo.   It is the one for which the German General Staff woulc vote unhesitatingly.   It is the one that corresponds best with the Instincts and tho more sober traditions of the German peoiDlt in whose eyes, moroover, it has been justified so far by its success.   It is the one which the moderate and progressive elements in Germany would naturally favour.   For once achieved it Is, in the main, a defensive scheme, which will occupy Germany and tho nations over which she has acquired influence or control with problems of internal political and economic adjustment, in the course of solving which Germany may also recast her own system of government.   The other scheme is an unfinished adventure, calling for fresh efforts, involving fresh external complications, and tending to postpone the consideration of domestic reforms.Moreover it has no roots in the life of the people. The German Colonies represent no great historical tradition; only an Infinitesimal fraction of the German people have over visited them; and up to the present, at least, they have only played a very small part in tho economic life of Germany0   The loss of tho whole of thorn would leave loss permanent resentment in tho mind of the German people than the loss of cither Alsace or Poson.     It would bo the death blow to a policy With which tho present Emperor&apos;s name is deeply associated, but no serious or lasting wound to the national life of Germany.   The one danger ^ Germany involved, namely the cutting off of all sources of tropical raw materials would be mitigated If she still retained control over Asia Minor, and if she could secure from tho&apos;Allies terms that would not wholly exclude her trade from their tropical possessions.
- ui 215But what applies to Germany regarded separately applies with Bar greater&apos;foreo to the Alliance in which she is a&apos; partner.   lone of her Allies have any interest in oversea Empire or in tho rivalry with England.   On tho other hand each and all of thorn are vitally interested in tho mainten-anco of Middle-Europe, and their interests and views will have to Be considered, unless the whole Alliance is to Break down, a thing which Germany will endeavour at all costs to prevent,;     This factor is Bound to have its influence not only as Between Colonial and Continental claims, but also as between Continental claims in different parts of Europe. Germany, by herself, nay consider tho control of Belgium worth moro to hor than tho control of Serbia.   But Austria-Kunga,ry, Bulgaria, and in a lesser degree Turkojr, are all deeply concerned in the la,tter, and not concerned in the formero   When the great block of tho Central Powers comos to be whittled down it will Bo tho outlying ends - Belgium, Courland, Mesopotamia, Syria - that will bo surrendered far more readily than the central sections i3e0 Poland, Roumania, Bulgeria and 3or&quot;oia.Turning now to tho question of tho British interest in the terms of poaco it seems obvious that all tho considerations arising out of1the new methods of warfaro and the new world environment&apos; generally reinforce the arguments in favour of the traditional British policy of eliminating tho enemy1s oversea bases and ut iiising them to develop now sources of economic strength for the Empire.   But the danger to sea communications which&apos; may be created by submarines and raiders in tho future oven at immense distances from their bases, and tho fact that the elimination of German bases alone does not create safety for all time, makes it imperative, wherever possible, to link up the different portions of-tho Empire, by land, in order to. secure railway intercommunication..     Tho need for this may Bo greatly Intensified, By tho future developments of long-distance aviation, both for civil- and for military purposes.   ITcr, as
far as can &quot;bo foreseen, thase-&quot;de\^omeni^s^illJ:or^a-long-time to come bo dependent upon the provision of landing-stations and lighthouses at comparatively short intervals.The above considerations apply with peculiar force to that great southern half of the British Umpire which lies in an irregular somi-circio round tho Indian Ocean - South Africa East Africa, Egypt, India, Australia, Hot; Zealande   The self-governing Dominions in this region aro still far too thinly populated to be able to cope by themsolvos with any serious naval or military menace a     India, for all hor immense popula-tion, has not yet reached tho stage either of economic orpolitical development in which she could make an effort capablthoof coping with tho immense forces which ono of/modern world states can put forth.   To secure the safety of this region during the next generation it is imperative that its seas should bo kept clear of all hostile naval bases, that potentic armies of invasion should bo kept as far away as possible, an: that the intsmommuhQnation by railway and by air, as woll as by soa, between the different portions of tho Empire which it comprisos, should bo as fully developed as possible.     The retention of German East Africa, of Palestine and Mesopotamia, and of the German Pacific Colonies, is the indispensible mean of securing this end.     The retention of Gorman South rest Africa, in so far as it is essential to the safety and peace of South Africa itself, may be included in the same category of conditions vital to the peaceful growth and development of tho Southern British Empire,The additional economic resources which can be created -in the Southern Empire, thus enlarged and linked together, is very considerable.   East --nfrica, dovelopcd as a single economic unit from tho Zambesi to the head waters, of the ITile, contains groat potentialities.    The restoration of
He so pot arils to its former-prosperity is only a question of setting the old irrigation system in workinw order again and finding now population, whothor hy natural increase or by immigration.    It is hardly necessary to draw special attention to tho possibilities of development in India, and in tho Dominions of the Southern Hemisphere.   That is a matter for tho internal economic policy of tho BBiplro rather than for a consideration of the essential terms of peaceeAs regards the remaining German Colonies, vis. Camcrocns and Togoland, their retention In Allied hands is a less vital matter.   Prom the naval point of view it is certainly undosir-able to put the Germans in a- position to create a naval base at Duala, or to sot up again their wireless station In Togoland Prom the political point of view, too, there is something to be said for a &quot;clean cut&quot; which will make a definite end cf the German project of oversea Empire, and leave no stepping stone for fresh ambitions in that direction.   On the other hand, if tho restoration of one or other of those Colonies to Germany is necessary in order to enable Prance to secure some European desideratum which is of.greater importance to her, it might be invidious on our- part to make difficulties0Tho defeat of the German oversea project is, however, not sufficient in itself, even as far as purely British interests are concerned.   It is essential to our own security, as well as to the security and legitimate aspirations of our Allies, that the area at this moment occupied, or controlled oy Germany in Europe and Asia should be reduced, and drastically reduced.   The first and most essential reduction, whether from the point of view of British and Brcnch security, or of the vindication of the principles for which&apos; the Allies nave con-tended, is the complete liberation of Belgium.   Bext in importance,. as far as our own interests are concerned, is the safeguarding of our position in Palestine and
Mesopotamia,     The satisfaction of Eronch aspirations in Syria and Lossor Armenia and tho Russian occupation of Greater Armenia, as already provided for in tho agreement between the throe Powers, would provide an offee-tive buffer against tho Contra! Powers in this region.   Even more effective for this purpose would be tho Russian occupation of Constantinople or .the Dardanelles, cutting off Turkey from&quot;, tho Central Powers.   An alternative to this, mado possible by tho, Russian revolution, is the detachment of Turkey from her Allies on tho terms of hor retaining.Constantinople, but sub-nitting to some international arrangement as regards tho SiraitcV7o now corao to Central Europe and the&quot;Balkans.   That the whole of this region should remain under tho direct control of tho enemy Powers is not consistent with our safety or with our obligations towards our Allies.   But tho particular mode in which the problems of this region arc solved Is not a vital British interest.   Vie are bound to contend for the restoration to independence of our smaller Allies who have been overrun by the enemy, and for tho repair of tho devastation which they have suffered.   Tie arc bound to support, as far as wo reasonably can, their claims to an enlarged national existence, as woll as the claims of Prance or Italy for the reunion of territories attached to them, by race or sentiment.   But wo may bo forced to recogniso that the solution of those problems which wo consider most complete and satisfactory may not bo attainable, or only attainable at a prohibitive cost, and that we may have tc bo content with securing our objects in some directions and not in others.In order, however, to form some idea of tho lines on which a settlement in these regions is likely to bo attained it may not bo amiss tc give first tho settlement which embodies the maximum realisation of the wishes and ideals of the Allies, on tho supposition of the complete collapse of the Central Powers
and then to state- tho obstacles to tho attainment of this maximum presented by tho greater or less degree of determination with which tho various features comprised in the scheme will be resisted by the enemyaThe Allied maximum as sot forth in tho published declare tions of statesmen and in tho unpublished treaties contracted botwoon the members of the Alliance is substantially as follows:-(1)     Belgium to be liberated, indemnified and probably enlarged by tho inclusion of Luxembourg^(2)     Franco to recover Alsace-Lorraine(3)     Italy to acquire the Trontiiio, Trieste and Istria, most of the Dalmatian Islands and the northern half of Dalmatia.(4)     Serbia to acquire 3osnia-Her aegovina and southern Dalmatia, including Spalato. and facilities to bo given to Croatia, Slavonia and the Slovene provinces of Austria to accuiro local independence and federate with, or Be incorporated in, a Jugoslav state including the whole Serbo-Croat race.    Presumably too she would retain all Serbian Macedonia,,(5)     Bulgaria to Be reduced again to the territory held By her before the war, and subjected to a heavy indemnity,(6)     Roumania to acquire the lino of the Danube to its con-fluenco with tho Thoiss, thence up the Thciss to its confluence with tho Maros, thence along a line running north-eastwards to tho uppor course of tho Pruth and following that river round to the present Russo-Roumanian frontier - in ether words Transylvania&apos;and a very large part of the rest of the Kingdom of Hungary.(7)     An independent Poland to be sot up, probably united to Russia by a military convention,,including Galicia (Eastern or Buthonian Galicia, howovor, being possibly annexed directly to Russia), the eastern half of Silesia, Poson, and, according to some, a strip of territory down the Vistula to the Baltic, including Dantzig.
(0 J     A now Czoeho-Slovak stato to bo sot Hp by tho union of Bohemia, Moravia and the Slovak districts of northern Hungary; this stato might possibly bo united in a .3oderal union with Poland, if tho latter wore entirely independent..(9)     At various times suggestions have boon made that Schleswig-IIoistcin and tho Kiel Canal should bo given to Denmark, or Danish speaking Schloswig restored to Denmark and tho ICiol Canal occupied by an international force or destroyed.The complete scheme is based, in the main, on the idea of creating a sorion of effective barriers to tho project of Gorman domination or pormeation ovor Central Europo by a roarrange-ment of tho political map on ethnographic linos.   Tho ctlmographic scheme is necessarily incomplete for various reasons.   Alsace is othnographically German though not Gorman in sentiment. Eastern Istria, the Dalmatian Islands and Dalmatia, which Italy insists upon securing for strategic reasons, aro in race and sentiment Slav and not Italian.   The proposed Greater Roumania would Include largo and compact Magyar, Sorb and Gorman minor-itios.     Greater Poland would include Gorman minorities in Posen and Silosia not to speak of the German city of Dantzig,   The proposed Czoeho-Slovak state would include a very large- and irreconcilable German element.   The scheme also takes little account of tho strength and permanence of such historical tradi-tions as aro embodied in Hungary or Prussia.   ITor do the various frontiers as devised satisfy modern conditions of dofensibility or,economic development, unless, indeed, tho whole group of new states created by it, viz: Poland, Greater Bohemia^ Lnssor Hungary, Greater Roumania and Creator Serbia, federate in a common economic and military uir ion.The scheme as it stands is undoubtedly ono which involves the break-up of Austria-Eungary, as well as sacrifices on tho part of Germany to which she would only consent in the last extremity, and with the determination to reverse tho verdict of
- 19 -2 2the present war at the earliest possible opportunity.   The . question then arises:   what modifications in the scheme aro possible in tho first placo to- ensure relative stability, in the event of the complete collapse of tho Central Powers, and in the second placo to achieve the main objects of British and Allied policy in tho event of a loos complete victory?   To answer this question it is necessary to look at tho various Allied aims enumerated above from tho enemy1 s point of vie?;, and consider which of them ho regards as absolutely inadmissible, and, as to tho rcstj what relative order of importance ho attaches to the surrender involved.Tho/surroiidor cf Schleswig-Eolstoin - except perhaps of the Banish northern half of Schloswig - and of the Kiel Canal - is ono to which Germany would never consent.   3or would Denmark dare to incur tho lasting hatred of Germany by taking it over. It could, In any case, only bo extorted from Germany under condi-tions of disaster so complete that any future danger from Germany1s naval power would ox hypothosi have boon eliminated already.   It is not a practical condition to enforce.Tho same applies to the idoa of cutting a Polish wedge down to tho sea at Dantzig and isolating East Prussia.   Germany would rooccupy it before the year was out and defy Europe to remobiliso and compel its surrender.    The idea is not practical politics, though it might bo possible to secure special transit facilities for Poland down      tho Vistula and over the railway to Dantsig.   Tho surrender of Boson and tho Polish speaking districts of Silesia is hardly loss difficult.   Poson has belonged to Prussia for 140 years.    It contains a large German minority.   Eastern Silesia has been Prussian for 100 years and Austrian before that and has never formed part of tho Polish Kingdom.   In any case the loss cf a. largo and important agricul-tural and industrial region with a population of over 4,000,000, a loss which would moreover bring a foreign power to within
100 miles of Berlin, Is one which Germany, and more particularlyPrussia, would only consent to in the very last extremity.     Itis, however, just conceivable that Germany might consent to thecession of Posen to Poland, as part of an internal rearrangementof a Middle-European federation of which Poland was a member. -&apos;.cuThe Question of Alsace-Lorraine is a pe/oJlar one. Alsaoe is German by &quot;race and was part of the old German Empire. Its recovery in 1871 was regarded by Germany as the reversal of two centuries of French aggression upon the corpus vile of a disunited and help]ess Germany, and G-ermars always hope that the Preach sentiment among tho Alsatians will eventually- die out, Lorraine on the other hand was prench in race, and was anze xed against Bismarck&apos;s advice because the German general staff insisted on retaining the fortress,of Metz.     Its loss would be no deep injury to German feeling and Germany would readily give it back to Prance, whom she is anxious to conciliate.    - The difficulty in the way is the Jjorraine iron-field which produces more &quot;than half the total iron ore produced in Germany, and whose transfer to Prance wouldpractically halve the German iron industry and double that of Prance.     Germany would probably be quite willing to cede Mctz and most of Lorraine if she   could retain the Iron-field and Luxembourg,   which from the industrial point of view goes with it.     But Germany will fight very hard before she surrenders the iron-field (even with guarantees for continued access to the supply of ore), or Alsace.     But she will probably yield the whole of Alsace-Lorraine sooner thangive up Posen or Polish Silesia.The question of a Dzecho-Slovak Greater Bohemia outside the control of the Central Empires is another reasure which would be resisted to the last by Austria and Hungary as dis-memberment,, and by Germany as involving the enslavement of 4,000,000 Germans, mostly living on the&apos; actual frontiers of
Bavaria, Saxony and Silaaia..     It- is&quot;MxrubiriwLLL, 4^ tka cera ,atate cjould, in any case, stand &quot;by itself.     If it came to a - triaX^of-strength it is not impossible that the German minority in -Bohemia? Tfoiild defeat the Czech .majority, march on Prague and declare annexation to Germany.     The Czeche could certainly not prevent tne German districts, at any rate, joining Germany.     But the result of that would Bo to leave Bohemia with an absolutely -indefensible frontier.     The Slovak end of the new state has never had any connection with Bohemia.     Its people&quot; though closely akin to the Czechs are on an entirely different plane.of civilisa-tion, being in the main simply        peasantry of districts whose administration finance and social and political control has always teen in Magyar hands.     Geographically and economically it is part of Hungary, and the Magyar determination to retain it is a ,:-, political factor of quite a different character-to any academic preference for union v&apos;lth Bohemia.     The Allies at a Peace Conference may, legitimately, press for a greater measure of autonomy to Bohemia, and for some recognition of the language and local government righto of the Slovaks in Hungary.-    But obviously tho Czechoslovak state is not worth the prolongation of the war which would be involved in the offort to secure it.The same is true of Greater Roumania.     The Roumanian claim, as  greed to by the Allies,- amounts to cutting more than a third off the area of the Kingdom of Hungary,-    In that area some 60 per cent of the population is of Roumanian race,     But it has always formed part of the Hungarian Kin gdomj    apart from large and compact Magyar and   German areas the whole of the large land-owning) official and oomi.ero.i3aI classes have been Magyar or German. . .. The Roumanian population; though resentful of Magyar arrogance and oppression, has not apparently any very strong desire ror le ing incorporated   in the Kingdom of Roumania,. v/hose people
-    2they are said to lfl^k upon as an Inferior &quot;branch 0* thei* r&amp;flfl.The Magyars will never surrender Eastern Hungary and Transylvania unless actually driven&apos; out by force, and theh only with the intention of reconquering it at the first opportunity, a task which, judging by the experience of the present war, might not, prove too difficult.-    -It is&quot; ho use the. Allies attempting, to set up a structure which will not&apos; stand, and they will probably be compelled in the end to recognise the necessity.of jettisoning the pledges which Roumania insisted on securing from them, and contenting themselves with the effort to secure a less oppressive treatment of the Roumanian population of Hungary.Lastly the Central Fo?/ers trill have to be ve5y far reduced before they consent to be shut out entirely from access to the Adriatic.     This question in its detailed aspects is so closely linked with the Jugoslav question and with the question of Italy&apos;s demands that it .is best discussed in that connexion; But, together ^rith the points referred to above, it. is included in what may be termed the enemy&apos;s irreducible minimum,.     On these points Germany and Austria-Hungary will only give way in case cf absolute starvation or complete military collapse.There remain as points for negotiation in accordance with the degree of military success which may fee attained by the Allied armies in the course of 1917 or 1918 the following issues::fcl)    the future status and extent of Poland;(2)   . the future status and extent of the Kingdom of Roumania;(3)     the.future.status and extent&quot; of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Jugoslav&quot;question;(4)     the demands of Italy;(5)     Bulgaria;(6)     Greece.Of-these issues the t&quot;ro to which the Central Powers will attach greatest importance are Poland and Roumania.    If these, two states can be kept united by economic and military conventions to the Central Powers the latter -will secure, firstly a sufficient&apos;
supply of foodstuffs and pe t r ol, &quot; s e condly, the ehortes t-po^Lible--frontier against Russia and one well removed from their own capitals and centres of industry., thirdly, a frontage on the Black Sea and the - complete control of tho Danube.,     To gain these ends Austria might even Be induced to cede Galicia to Poland - and the Bukovina to Roumania, the latter in eaohange for the whole   of the Dobrudja -given to Bulgaria as her share of the spoil.     If the military situation allows It the Central Powers will still probably make an attempt to occupy not only Moldavia but Bessarabia as well.     Bessarabia is Roumanian in race and was only annexed by Russia in 1878.     To restore it to Roumania . would be a bold way of binding Roumania to the Gorman chariot wheel.  &apos;If the connexion with Bulgaria through Roumania isassured, the Central. Powers are Bess deeply affected by thesolution of the Serbian problem.,     Tbey would probably make nogreat difficulty about the restoration of the Serbian Kingdom. lie bin its integrity; though it might/be easy to induce Bulgaria to surrender Eastern Serbia and Macedonia without considerably more military pressure than has been applied hitherto.     Bor would they make serious objection to its- union with Montenegro. Even the cession to Serbia of Bosniadlerzegovina and of the adjoining strip of Adriatic coast would not be resisted re arly ae,strongly as any of the other Allied aims discussed above. There Is, - indeed, both in Austria and in Germany a considerable school whi-oh, developing the ideas of the late Archduke Brands Ferdinand,, would accept the principle of a Jugoslav stats, provided it ware unified under Austrian auspices.     Such a solution f*rom the Austrian point of.view would preserve access to the Adriatic, at any rate through Plume and the ports further south, /ana furnish a solid buffer against Italian ambitions, ,..Brhe surrender of. the Trent! no, cf Gcrizia andeven of
2 fdTrieste and I stria might aMo bemmada by Austria with less&apos;      a -.- &apos; -difficulty than most other surrenders, providing always that access to the Adriatic remained open through Eiune.     lor would she make any serious fight to prevent Italy acquiring a suzerainty over Albania or occupying some of the Dalmatian islands,     The surrender of any part of the Dalmatian mainland would be  -another matter and would be strenuously resisted both by Austria and by Serbia,From the point of view of the Western Allies the most important points to secure in the Central European sphere are the satisfaction-of Italy&apos;a reasonable ambitions and the restora-tion   of Serbia, with an increase of territory which should at least give her Bosnia-Herzegovina and an outlet on the Adriatic. The union of the whole Jugoslav race, desirable as it might be in the Allied interest, would be difficult to carry out, in so far as it involved cutting Austria-Hungary off from the Adriatic altogether, unles-s it were under conditions which practically indiuded the Jugoslav state in Austria or at any rate in Middle-Europe.     Erom the point of view of the South Slav race itself such a solution might not prove unacceptable,     Prom the Allied point of view it would certainly be less desirable than a Jugoslav state united under Allied auspices, and Italy, at least, would be strongly opposed to such a eo lutioho     But the solution is one which might be favoured if the Central Powers were sufficiently weakened in other directions, e,g. by the defection of Bulgaria, or the reassertion of Russian control over Poland, And in any case the inclusion in Austria, or in the Central European group, of a large homogeneous unit conscious of the fact that its unity has been won by the help of the Allies would &quot;tend to act as a brake upon the power of Germany to utilise the whole group for purposes of aggression.
It may be said that the line of argument developed above leaves out cf account Russia&apos;s interests which are more directly concerned with Poland and Roumania,     Put unless Russia, is more successful in the field and less absorbed in. her own internal piwblems, the terms, of the peace settlement will certainly be determined by the wishes and interests of the Western Allies rather than by those of Russia.Prom an impartial standpoint, indeed, it is justifiableto argue that Russia with her immense bulk and compact defensibleshape is more truly interested in her own internal reorganisationdand is better off without being saddled with Polish or Roumanian problems; and this apparently is also the view of considerable sections of opinion in Russia itself,     In any case the general conclusion that may reasonably be -drawn from a survey of the Central European problem is that the settlement of the Italian and Serb questions in the Allied&apos; sense is more easily attainable than an Allied settlement.of the Polish and Roumanian questions.&apos;As regards Bulgaria there&quot; ic always the possibility. that she might be detached from her Allies by fairly generous terms once the tide of war-has definitely turned.     But her interests are so closely identified with the success, in peace as well as in war, of the Central. Powers, that such a defection is really not very probable.     Railing that the Allied interest obviously is to reduce and weaken Bulgaria as far as possible for the benefit of our AAlies Serbia and Roumania^  and even of Greece.The fame of Greece is hardly of sufficient importance to affect British interests grea/tly one way or another^ though., generally speaking,,  a strong and prosperous Greece would corres-pond both with war sympathies and our interests.   Meanwhile the hapless little country itself is likely to continue^ to be a field of contention between Prance, and Italy.. each, of whom is apparently anxious to occupy or &quot;protect&quot; as much of Greece as
J&apos;S6&apos;-- 228The treatment of the Central   European and Balkan problem in the preceding pages is extremely sketchy,- judged by the stan-dard of the complexity of the problem itself.   Bug judged by the standard of the importance which the precise manner of its settle-ment has for us as compared with the settlement of the German Colonies, the Turkish Empire and Belgium, its length may seem very disproportionate.     It is only necessary to repeat again that, while it is to the British interest that the great liiddle-Buropean block should be substantially out down, the precise manner in which this is effected concerns our Allies more than ourselves,  and the extent to which it can be carried out,  or is worth carrying out, depends on the degree of military success we may have achieved or which it may still be worth attempting to achieve.     Two main principles , indeed / should - be held fast, to in any negotiations on these issues.     The first is-that our smaller Allies should,  at all costs, be restored to independence, and receive such financial assistance as will enable them to start again.     The second that even within the area that may remain under the general control of the Central,Bowers the scttlc-ment should Be as far as possible on broad national lines.   Even if Poland, BcherrB&apos; a.  Hungary and Jugoslavia all remained within Middle--Europe-, it would bo better,  in our Interest as well as in tho interest cf European staBiJicy, that they should bp included as compact units wild a vigorous national -consciousness and interest of their own, than that they shoul d be parcelled up in a fashion which would aJ lew of their most effective exploitation by Germany for plans of economic or military aggression.Summing up this general review of the whole situation wo may say that the fiist and greatest British interest is to clear the field ebsoiu tcly of the Ceuran menauB   to cur existence as an Oceanic EBayii eg Beyond out on - its sea c ommu ni c at ions, by removing from German control all naval bases, colonies,  or points
of vantage such as- Belgium^JP-al-ssstdLn-Ht      l ^so^oi^aiai.a,, which can serve as instruments for reviving that menace.   Our next interest is to protect tho position thus secured, by such further-measures, particularly in the Hear East and Mediterranean, as vill limit Germany&apos;s economic and military control, and enlist tho permanent interest of our Allies in so limiting it..    The establishment of Russia anl Franco in Armenia and Syria, tho isolation of Turkey from the Central Powers either by the Russian acquisition of Constantinople and the Straits, or by a separate peace with Turkey, and the development of Allied..  e.g. Italian,  economic interests in Asia Minor in the place of German intcrests,embraces the chief items in this programme.     Lastly come such other measures as may be feasible to reduce tho-preponderance that vould still bo left to the Central Powers in Europe, to satisfy the claims of our Allies, and, as far as possible, to resettle the mid-European situation on stable lines.With regard to thi3 sequence in importance of tho objects to be aimed at, Erench and Belgian interests coincide almost entirely with ours-, the only special interest of Prance which is not of direct but only of general interest to ourselves being the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine.     The claims of Italy and of Serbia can also; in the event of a reasonable degree of military success, be sustained effectively by us as part of the third general object of &quot;our policy.   Tho claims of Roumania -and to a largo extent of Russia aro of least direct interest to the Western Allies and will be the most difficult to secure unless the Russian army itself can secure them.   Looking at the situa-tion from the point of view of the enemy Powers the first category cf British objects, the loss of the German Colonies, and of the south-eastern portion of Turkey in Asia-,. is also the one in &quot;tfhich they vill most readily acquiesce, providing Germany has either by retaining Asia Minor or one of her West African Colonies, or by treaty stipulation,  a reasonably secure prospect
of getting access to supplies of tropical or sub-tropical raw materials..    The second category of British objects again is the one which, from the point of view cf the Central Powers,.will be the next easiest to secure.     Most difficult will be the third, which touches the vital interests and domestic position of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria,  and here again the objects which concern Russia and Roumania will be the most difficult to secure. Broadly speaking, in fact, the war is likely to be settled at the expense of the outlying and less effectively organised elements of each-group of combatants,  i.- eof the German Colonial Empire, of Turkey and of Russia,The essential thing at this stage of the war is for the British Empire to concentrate all its efforts on making certain of its vital objects..    The power of the status quo is so enormous that it will make all the difference whether the principal objects of our policy are already in Allied military possession before the negotiations begin.      Those in the first and second category, at least,  ought to be definitely, secured and in Allied hands before there can be much hope of securing any substantial achieves ment as regards the third category.     This means that, before w can really enter upon any Peace Conference with reasonable hopes of securing a satisfactory peace, we have still to accomplish certain definite military tasks.     The first is to drive the Germans out of Prance and Belgium, or,  at least, to assert&apos; such an ascendancy over them in the Western theatre of war that they recognise themselves that their expulsion from it is purely a question of time.     With the immense resources of America in the &quot;background that task ought now to be well within the capacity of the Allies.&apos;    The second is to drive the Turks entirely out cf Palestine, Syria. Mesopotamia and Armenia, keeping in mind the possibility - by no means a certainty - of being able to use the success attained in this advance to conclude a separate peace with j-urkey .
I Ipfllilfl 231 -Once these two objectives are attained the situation will have reached the point at which negotiations for peace can he opened.     Any success that will meanwhile have heen attained by the Pus si an or Italian armies or the Salonika So roe,, or any prospect of further military successes in any part of the field/ will be cur lever for securing as fan- as possible the third category cf objects previously defined,     Failure, on the other hand: whether on the Italian or Rossi en fronts or at Salonika, will not put the enemy in a position to wrest from us the results already achieved.     Put the effort which would be demanded of us to retriwe such failure by another series of campaigns, during which the submarine campaign would still be continuing.- might well be so exhausting that it might be necessary frankly to abandon most of the third category of objects,,  and be content with the achievement of the first two.     In other words the attain-ment of the two military objectives specified above macks not only the first   moment at which we can reasonably enter into peace negotiations, but the moment beyond which we ought not; in any aase, to defer such negotiations.     G-lven these promtsss the only thing that remains is to concentrate every effort in order to achieve these objectives in the shortest possible time, before the end . of the year if we can, if not at the earliest possible moment in the sping of 1918cGiven these conclusions;, how far is it necessary to re-adjust our diplomacy in.order to make it easier to achieve them?     It is necessary to. remember that to abandon publicly a pretension once made may not only weaken an enemyIs motive for resistance,, but also an ally : s motile for continuing his efforts, and may be taken by friend- and foe alike as a sign of weakness, This applies more particularly to those aims such as the incorporation of Posen and Silesia&apos;in an independent Poland, the Greater Bohemia and Greater Roumania projects or the complete   exclusion of the Central   powers from the&quot; Adriatic ..
21?to ts h)the abandonment of which is here advocated.     To announce this abandonment would effectively answer the assertion that we are bent on the annihilation of the Central Powers.     Bug it might v/eaken Russian support or even induce the final collapse of Roumanian resistance.     As regards the rest of our aims it would certainly be bad policy to indicate any weakening about them. The.only assumption on which allies can work during a war is that of complete   victory, and it is on this hypothesis that they regu-late their claims as between themselves.     Bo one supposes this to mean that in the event of incomplete victory such results as .are attained should be redistributed ani that those parties in the Alliance who have, for one reason of another, failed cr achieved but little should be compensated/at the expense of those who have been more successful.     But that is no reason for discounting the failure in advance, or informing our allies that we no longer expect to achieve this or that object that we have agreed toassist them in securing.On certain points, indeed, it might be well to ascertain how far the views of our Allies coincide with ours.     This more particularly applies to the case of Prance whose interests are so closely identical with our own.     In the case of Russia,  again, it is very important to make sure whether she still is resolved to get Constantinople, as a change of policy on her part in this respect at once opens the field for the possibility of a separate peace with Turkey, and even conceivably with Bulgaria.   And if we are contemplating a separate peace with Turkey it may become necessary to apprise Italy that her claims to territorial exten-sion or suzerainty in that quarter may have to be modified and converted into concessions of a purely economic character. What&apos; is essential is that Movlca should learn, not necessarily at once but before negotiations Begin the main outlines and purpose-   of our policy.   But what is most vital of all is that the policy decided upon should Be ciearly grarped and agreed upon as between
.. 31 -those who are responsible for the conduct of the affairs of the British Empire, and should furnish the mainspring of action for every Government in -the-Empire for the rest of the war.(initialled) L.S,A.llcltM&apos;/.The above notes deal entirely with the question of the terms to be settled between the combatants as a result of the war. and mainly with the terms as they affect the question of territorial sovereignity.     Bo attempt has been made to touch upon the wider question of what arrangements may be made, after that, between the nations at large for the prevention of &quot;wars and the diminution of armaments in future.   &apos; But it is obvious that the greater the stability of the settlement achieved between the combatants the less room it leaves for the renewal of old ambitions, or for desperate resolves to regain lost territories; the more It can satisfy legitimate national and racial aspirations, whether within.or without the boundaries of a particular grouping of Powers. and the more easily it lends itself to the work.of economic reconstruction after the war,  the easier will it be for such arrangements to be reached and to have any effect.     And in&apos;the main objects advocated in these notes - the complete elimina-tion of the German project for Oceanic supremacy, the acceptance ef what may be reckoned the irreducible minima of the Central Powers, and of a Middle Europe of reasonable dimensions, and the recognition that Polish and possibly even Jugoslav national lire might have to find its future development in association with the Central Powers - these considerations have been stfead-ily kept in view,, &apos;
