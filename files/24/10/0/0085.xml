[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.MEMORANDUM ,ON   PROPOSALS   FOR  DIMINISHING THE OCCASION OF FUTURE WARS.IT is estimated that the total number of killed and wounded in this war approaches 50,000,000 more than the population of the British islands and that of these 7,000,000 have been killed. These numbers include the women and children of Armenia, Syria, and the occupied territories, but by far the largest part consists of young men in the prime of health, strength, and ability. We have so far spent between 2,000 and 3,000 millions of pounds. Assuming our Allies have spent as much and our enemies half as much again the total expenditure has been not less than some 8,000 or 9,000 millions, and may well have been much more. Some part of this has gone to the nourishment, lodging, and clothing of the troops and other personnel. But a vervkrge proportion even of this expenditure is due to war conditioi^KlIt is safe therefore to say that the total sum actually wasted is now many thousands of millions. In addition, a considerable amount of fixed property, shipping, and goods have been destropeGL: representing certainly many millions more, and there have Iplpmo doubt other incidental losses. Taken altogether, the impoverishment of the world by waste of life, waste of labour, and destruction of material has been appalling. Human suffering has resulted on a scale unprecedented in the history of the world. Apart from the spectacular horrors, such as submarining, Zeppelin raids, the atrocities in France and Belgium, the Armenian massacres, the cold-blooded starvation of the Syrian population and the cruelties to the Poles, Serbians, and other inhabitants of conquered countries, the ordinary incidents of modern warfare are terrible. A small battle recorded as the capture of a few yards of trench involves the death by torture of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of young men, the maiming or blinding of as many more, and for the lucky ones horrible wounds inflicted by jagged fragments of high-explosive shells. Perhaps even harder to bear are the anxiety, the grief, and the bereavement which fall on the women at home.This is not all. People talk of the self-sacrifice and courage of those who fight, and it is indeed magnificent. But they forget the other side of the shield. Crimes of cruelty, lust, dishonesty, drunkenness have marked the advance, of almost every victorious army in history. German outrages in the early months of the war differed only in degree from the proceedings of other armies in similar circumstances. Nor do the evil results of war stop with the fighting. On the whole, there is little evidence that the civilian population at home have been sobered by the magnitude of the catastrophe or are bracing themselves to meet the fearful social and economic problems which will confront us when peace at length arrives. It may well be that, when the war is over, we shall be only at the beginning of our troubles.All this is very trite. My excuse for setting it out is to emphasise how disastrous is war in general and this war in particular. It is not too much to say that it has endangered the fabric of our civilisation, and if it is to be repeated the whole European S3rstem may probably disappear in anarchy. It is surely, therefore, most urgent that we should try to think out some plan to lessen the possibility of future war. Even if we succeed in destroying German militarism, that will not be enough. Militarism exists everywhere, even in this country. If the militarism of Germany is destroyed, what security have we that some other country may not take her place ? Nor can we hope that the settlement after the wTar will [488] &apos;
remove all causes of quarrel. Whatever shape the territorial arrangements may ultimately take, we can see enough of them already to be certain that they will not be final. Assumingit to-be true that a territorial settlement should be based on nationality, how can we defend the allotment of Contantinople to Russia, of Dalmatia to Italy, of Macedonia to Serbia, of the Banat to Roumania, or even of the German parts of Alsace to France ? And there will be many other causes of quarrel. Poland may not improbably be bitterly disappointed. Hungary will be restless under spoliation. Austria will be torn by political fear of, and racial sympathy for, Germany. Germany herself will be sore and unquiet. It is not improbable that Russia will be in serious domestic trouble-, from which a military despotism may well emerge. The South-East of Europe will be, as heretofore, a prolific breedingrground for every kind of civil and military disturbance. : :What then can be done? The only possible way out appears to be to try to substitute for war some other way of settling inter-national disputes. Two expedients suggest themselves : arbitration and conference of the Powers-European Concert. The difficulty of arbitration is to discover the arbitrators to whom sovereign Powers will be content to submit questions of vital importance. The fame objection does riot apply to conferences. But, as was found in the present war, no machinery exists, to force unwilling Powers to agree to a conference and await its decision. It would be simple to include in the * Treaty of Peace a general agreement to that effect. But if a group of Powers were determined on war, how are they to be compelled - to enter a conference? In other words, what is to be the sanction ? A provision that all the Powers shall combine to punish by force of arms a breach of the treaty will probably by itself be ineffective. As far as Europe is concerned, there will always be a tendency for the Powers to form themselves into two groups more or less equal in strength, and if one of these becomes aggressive it may and probably will ignore all treaties. Under those circumstances the risks of war are so great that few countries would enter it merely in support of treaties and international right, and the settlement of the dispute will be left to war between the Powers immediately concerned. If, however, an instrument could be found which would exert considerable pressure on a recal-citrant Power without causing excessive risk to the Powers using it, a solution of the difficulty might perhaps be found. I believe that in blockade as developed in this war such an instrument exists. No doubt for its full effect an overwhelming naval power is requisite. But much could be done even by overwhelming financial power, and with the two combined no modern State could ultimately resist its pressure. Suppose in July 1914 it had been possible for the Entente Powers to say to Germany and Austria, unless the ultimatum to Serbia is modified or a conference is called we will cut off all commercial and financial intercourse from you, it is very doubtful whether the Central Powers would have proceeded. If the United States could have, been induced to join in such a declaration the effect would have been enormously increased. And though it is certainly hopeless to expect America to fight in a European quarrel unless her interests are directly affected, it does not seem so certain that she would refuse to join in organised economic: action to preserve peace. It is assumed as a necessary condition of this proposal that a territorial: settlement of a reasonable sort is arrived at in the treaty, and its maintenance is guaranteed: by. the signatory Powers. It would enormously help if some effective agreement for the limitation of armaments could also be arranged; and in the first draft of this paper I had suggested provisions, with that object. But, in view of the convincing criticism by Sir E. CrowTe, I have decided to abandon that part of the scheme;I append a rough draft to. explain the working of the scheme.
sProposals for Maintenance of Future Peace.The High Contracting Powers further agree that the territorial arrangements hereinbefore set forth shall remain unaltered for the next five years. At, or if any of the High Contracting Powers so demands then before, the end of that period a conference of the High Contracting Powers shall be summoned, and any rearrange-ments of territory which have become necessary or desirable shall be then considered, and, if agreed upon, shall be forthwith carried out.If any difference or controversy shall arise between any of the High Contracting Powers, with respect to the meaning of any of the articles of this treaty, or with respect to the rights of any of the parties thereto, or with respect to any other matter, a conference of the Powers shall be forthwith summoned, and the controversy shall be submitted to it, and no action shall be taken by any of the parties to the controversy until the conference has met and considered the matter, and has either come to a decision thereon or has failed for a period of three months after its meeting to come to such a decision. Any decision agreed upon at such confeience shall be maintained and enforced by all the High Contracting Powers as if it were one of the articles of this treaty. . ^Each of the High Contracting Powers guarantees and agrees to maintain the provisions of this treaty if necessary by force of arms, and in particular undertakes that if any Power shall refuse or fail to submit any controversy to a conference as provided in the last pre-ceding article of this treaty, or shall otherwise infringe any of the provisions of this treaty, each of the High Contracting Powers shall thereupon cut off all commercial and financial intercourse with the wrongdoing Power, and as far as possible shall prevent such Power from having any commercial or financial intercourse with any other Power, whether a party to this treaty or not; and it is hereby further agreed that for the purpose of enforcing this provision, any of the High Contracting Powers may detain any ship or goods belonging to any of the subjects of the wrong-doing Power or coming from or destined for any person residing in the territory of such Power, and with the same object may take any other similar steps.which may seem desirable or necessary.
