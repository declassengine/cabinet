SEGEST.  -G.T. 427 ..,ii,x CA3Ii.!ET.Operations.Prom:- Lt.Gen. Hanbury Williams- to C.LG.S.10/4/17.95G.     I returned this afternoon with the Minister of War. I talked to many people during my two days5 visit and found none of them optimistic.    The position in Petrograd is briefly as follows:-Soldiers well behaved and orderly but doing no military work.Time is taken up with processions and playing of - the &quot;Marseil-laise&quot;.    Officers more or less subject to rule of men and manyare anxious to serve with British Army or elsewhere.    Staff dis-organised and only working at irregular hours,   llavy. Reportsfrom Baltic and Kronstat show&apos;no improvement.   Factories, These are thoroughly disorganised, and no regular work at full(one group).    I was told by an Englishman, head of large cottonworks, that never in his many years residence in Russia had heseen such a bad state of affairs.    He will.be compelled to closedown if it goes on for about a fortnight more.   Lien are askingridiculous wages and becoming insolent to English foreman ofworks.1,&apos;inister of War is very anxious as to the future but there are slight indications that the Army may get irritated with the &quot;orkmen who are making holiday, and if Army would (one group) re-disciplined and re-organised soldiers might make fresh revolution, against workmen and operatives i,e, the civilian element,    On the other hand should the malcontents extend their mischief to men at the front position will become impossible.Above represent my views generally.    It is not easy to get a clear estimate but this is as near -as can be I think.      We should get a better idea, in the next fortnight as to how we stand.
