[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government,] \ .     CONFIDENTIAL.[OTES BY SIR EYRE CROWE ON LORD R. CECILS PROPOSALS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF FUTURE PEACE.(&apos;) Rather &quot;to dimin-ish.&quot;- R.O.THE scheme outlined in Lord R. Ceoil&apos;s paper comprises the following cardinal points : (i.) A territorial settlement to be placed under the guarantee of the Powers signatories of the treaty of peace.(ii.) A conference of all the Powers to decide differences that may arise between any two or more among the signatories of the treaty of peace, in respect to this territorial arrangement. . -(iii.) The enforcement of the decisions of the conference by the commercial isolation of the offending State or States, to be effected by cutting off-partly by means of a nayal blockade all their trade and financial intercourse with other States.(iv.) As a subsidiary measure, the Powers, when assembled in conference, are to be invited to discuss the question of a general disarmament; and meanwhile the manufacture of the principal &quot;materiel de guerre,&quot; except in Govern-ment establishments, is to be prohibited.2. The object is to prevent^) future&quot; wars.3. How far the international machinery to be organised under the scheme will go to ensure the attainment of the desired object is a problem which presents&apos; much difficulty. It may assist the proper consideration of this problem if a number of points are put forward and examined which necessarily arise out of the premises.4. The questions which under the scheme would come before the conference will be seen to fall into four classes : (i.) Violation of the guaranteed territorial status quo ; (ii.) Proposals for the alteration of the territorial status quo bygeneral consent; (iii.) Differences between any two Powers on any questions; (iv.) Plans for a general limitation of armaments.5. The action of the conference in the first of these cases would consist merely in establishing the fact of a violation of the status quo and decreeing an execution against the guilty State by all the others. In the second and third cases the conference would act as a board of conciliation. The fourth case would be one rather of international legislation in the shape of general conventions on the model of the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907.6. Before considering how the conference would have to proceed in each of these cases, something must be said of its actual composition. The scheme seems to contemplate, although the point is not quite clear, that the conference should consist of the Powers signatories of the treaty of peace. That means the actual belligerents. On the other hand, there are certain features of the scheme which appear to imply a wider representation of States at the conference. Among the countries not engaged in the present war, there are several whose territories will have to enjoy the same guarantees of security as those - of the actual belligerents, if universal peace is to be assured on the basis of a generally accepted territorial  settlement.    It is only necessary to  mention  Spain,[488-1], &quot; J B
Holland, the Scandinavian countries, and Switzerland. Moreover, the co-operation of these Powers will be required in the coercive measures by which ultimately any attempt to violate the territorial status quo are to be restrained, if those measures are to attain, as they ought, their maximum of effectiveness. In fact, little short of the participation of all European States and of the United States of America would do. Then the experience of The Hague conferences shows that it would be impossible to leave out the South American republics. When everyone joins, China cannot be passed over, and it may accordingly be assumed that from a conference of Powers who are to undertake the duty of acting as the policeman of the world, no sovereign State can in the long run be excluded. For no Power can be asked to take coercive action, possibly against a formidable neighbour, without having a voice in decreeing coercion in the particular case as it arises.7.- If the conference is to be an international organ ready to start work at any moment and act with reasonable despatch, it will almost certainly be found convenient, if not necessary, to give it a fixed seat and habitation. For all intents and purposes the new conference would be the old Hague Peace Conference in a new dress. The essential difference would be that under the new scheme the conference would not endeavour to set up codes or rules for harmonizing and developing the law of nations, but- would discuss concrete cases of differences between individual States. It might however become a question whether these diverse functions could not be discharged by the same body, an arrangement which would be facilitated by the adoption of the modification in the scheme suggested by Lord E. Percy, under which the conference would devolve its powers on small and strong committees of enquiry.8. A pan-cosmopolitan conference of this type will possess in an exaggerated form all the vices of the old concert of Europe, the principal of these being that it is formidable ;as an instrument of passive obstruction, but correspondingly feeble as an engine of development and well-directed effort towards progress. This characteristic will not be without influence on its general attitude and mcde of action in the four classes of cases coming before it under the scheme.9. The first case is that of a violation or attempted violation of the guaranteed territorial status quo. Until the attempt has actually been made to induce &quot;the Powers to assume definite responsibility for preventing violation of the status quo and to pledge themselves jointly and singly to Common coercive action against any State breaking this solemn covenant, it must remain a matter for speculation whether such a defensive union of all the Powers is in fact possible. No confident forecast can be made. Whilst it would be rash to assume that the Powers will enter into the convenant with alacrity, it can be urged that a scheme offering, at the smallest individual risk and cost, a maximum of coercive power to restrain any rebellious member of the community of nations, might be expected to meet with general acceptance after the conclusion of a war which has undoubtedly created in all parts of the world a strong feeling that something ought to be done to uphold the sanctity of international treaties.10. For the purpose of the present discussion it will be assumed that the solemn league and covenant between all the nations can be and win be established. But it is necessary to observe that this is a treaty, like other treaties. What is there to ensure that it will not, like other treaties, be broken ? Lord R. Cecil himself points to the danger that a strong and aggressive group of Powers might ignore all treaties. This danger is to be overcome by the strength of the coercive machinery to be put into operation against the offender. This strength/however, is not an absolute quantity; it is strictly
arelative, and itself a function of the grouping of the Powers. The various causes bringing about such groupings need not here be examined, but it.is well not to forget that the real force which can alone bind together all. the Powers, in opposition to a disturber of the status quo, is a moral one. - It resides ultimately in the conviction that the ,siatus quo to be maintained is desirable and just. Once the idea gains ground that, owing to whatever circumstances, the territorial arrangement is no longer just or desirable, there will inevitably be a loosening of the ties uniting the Powers in common resistance to a change however brought about, and defections from the conservative group to the group favouring a change will be facilitated. Every State which the aggressive group can win over to its side counts double in the balance, like transferred party votes in a parliamentary division, and, what is perhaps even more important, every weakening of the conservative group proportionately increases the difficulties and dangers attending its forcible intervention. It tends, more particularly, to expose those States which are unfavourably situated geographically, to added risks of invasion and destruction.11. What in such a situation is the value of the solemn covenant, and what are the chances that the pledge of common coercive action will be redeemed ? It is difficult to avoid the conclu-sion that the chances will be ruled by the respective weights in the balance of power, just as they have been hitherto. When a combi-nation of Powers commands a preponderance of force-using the v. ord &quot; force &quot; in its widest sense and the necessary means of aggression, there can be no certainty that an effort on its part to alter the territorial settlement for its own benefit will be actively resisted by the rest of the world. The degree of probability whether there will be such resistance or not will be found to depend on how far the threatened disturbance would directly or indirectly affect the position of the individual , State, and on the balance of forces marshalled, or available to be marshalled, on either side.12. It may be that &quot;Powers which might hesitate to embark on dangerous and costly military opei-ations would show greater readiness to join in measures of commercial blockades and financial boycott. But this, at best, is only relatively true. Supposing a combination of a strong Germany and a strong Russia, is it to be expected that Austria, ttervia, Roumania, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and Switzerland would unhesitatingly declare a general boycott against all German and Russian trade and finance? It ma,y be predicted with some assurance that they would do so only if entirely confident that their own territories would not be overrun by their powerful neighbours. And supposing those territories were so overrun, would the prospect of speedily reducing such a compact mass of territory to a state;of economical helplessness by means of blockade and boycott be so definitely assured as to overcome all apprehensions and hesitations ?13. Still, it may be said that such a contingency is not likely ; that the scheme does not pretend to afford an absolute guarantee against any possible war in any circumstances; and that it will serve if it helps -to reduce the probability of war to a minimum. There is force in this argument, and the mere fact of all the Powers being solemnly pledged in case of any violation of the territorial status quo to enforce a general commercial and financial boycott against the offender cannot but help to diminish the risk of war in many instances-where otherwise this risk might be very great. It is in cases of this kind that the conference would be most favourably placed for. fulfilling its mission. In so far as its primary function will be to act as the guardian, of the territorial settlement, the conservative force inherent in its constitution should give it strength
to resist encroachments.   Would it be safe to place it higher than that?14. However perfect may be the machinery for enforcing the maintenance of the territorial status quo, it offers no complete solution of the wider problem of how to avert war in general. To begin with, the indefinite continuance of the territorial arrangement existing at any particular time, is an impossibility. It would tie undesirable if it were possible. And further: not all wars arise directly out of territorial disputes, and the maintenance of the territorial status quo is not synonymous with the preservation of peace. True, a war from which one side emerges decisively victorious is likely to lead to territorial changes, though even this need not be. But many wars were begun on grounds unconnected, at least on the surface, with territorial questions. The great wars of 1864,(1) I860, C1) Surely this is not and 1870, as also the South African war of 1899, arose out of claims ofltSK-R 0*&quot;* other than territorial; and indeed the same may be said of the present war. For when Austria invaded Serbia she explicitly disavowed any territorial ambition.15. Any organisation to be set up for the purpose of averting war must be made to operate in respect to all causes whatever of grave dispute between nations, whether involving territorial questions or not.   This is in fact recognised in the second and third parts of the scheme as analyze i at the head of the present memorandum. But whilst the mode of action of the conference, as guardian of a  -guaranteed settlement is indicated in the scheme without ambiguity, the precise way in which &quot; differences&quot; or controversies arising ^between two or more Powers on questions other than the maintenance of the territorial status quo are.to be settled by the intervention of the conference, is not so clearly explained.   The question is of practical importance, and its solution is closely affected by the organic   Constitution    and   essential   attributes   of   diplomatic conferences.16. The plan of the conference is, in the scheme, suggested as an alternative to a court of arbitration on the ground that sovereign States will not readily accept the award of a body of &quot;arbitrators on matters vital to their existence or interests. This argument recognises tbe fundamental difference between a court of arbitration and a diplomatic conference as lying in the fact that the former must give a definite decision on a clearly stated issue, whilst the latter can arrive at no decision except on points on which all the Powers are agreed. Such agreement, where vital principles are at stake, is only possible as a rule if the direct issue is avoided. By corn-promising on unessentials, a decision on the main questionsJn dispute may be postponed if none of the Powers is in fact prepared to go to extremes. Where, on the other hand, the situation is such that the decisive issue cannot be evaded, then, if the parties cannot accept arbitration because the dispute involves a principle on which they will not be dictated to, their going into a conference will offer no: solution.17. As a means of preventing a war over a question on which Powers will not compromise, a conference could function successfully only if it abandoned the fundamental principle of its constitution, which is the requirement of unanimity of decisions, which, in turn, is based on the sovereignty, independence, and equality of the States represented. If a diplomatic assembly abandoned the principles of unanimity and proceeded to arrive at decisions by votes of majorities, it would cease to be distinguishable from a court of arbitration, save as regards the personal qualifications of its members and the latitude of its procedure. Given a really grave difference of views or aims, in respect to which one or more Powers are determined not to give way to the majority, the risk of an armed
conflict is not avoided by substituting a diplomatic conference for an arbitration court.18. It seems hardly necessary to labour the point that the same objections which are felt to stand in the way of any system of general compulsory arbitration, are fatal to the plan of a conference acting by majorities. Nor will it be overlooked that Great Britain in particular would be exposed to special and grave dangers ; for a substantial majority among the Powers could at almost any time be found for measures ostensibly designed to favour the general cause of peace, but in effect calculated to curtail British supremacy at sea. A special temptation to move in this direction would be offered if the conference had the mission to take up the question of a limitation of armaments. It is well to remember that almost the whole energies of the 2nd Peace Conference at The Hague in 1907 were unmistakably directed to the weakening of our sea-power. Had it been possible for the conference to make decisions by majorities, arid to ensure the enforcement of such decisions, our naval supremacy would have received a grave set-back. Apart from general and governing considerations-of principle, the unanimity rule as inherent in the constitution of diplomatic conferences is vital to this country.1.9. Clearly, however, any scheme which contemplates enforcing the &quot; decisions &quot; of a conference against a recalcitrant Power must either be restricted to the rigid maintenance of a status quo unani-mously accepted beforehand, or assume that fresh decisions may be made by majorities. Whilst the second of-these alternatives must be discarded for the reasons already given, the first leaves practically unsolved the problem with which we set out to deal, and which may now, perhaps, be restated in wider terms: how to ensure, through the operation of international conferences, limited to action within the rules of unanimity, that grave disputes affecting the relations between independent States are settled only by means which exclude recourse to war.20. The settlement of any dispute means one of two things : either (a) one or the other of the disputants obtains what he demands, his opponent giving way; or (6) a compromise is effected, both sides making concessions. It should be added that a corn-promise can be considered a settlement only if it in fact implies that the opposing parties accept it as closing the dispute. A compromise on unessential details, leaving the heart of the dispute untouched and the opponents still decided to vindicate their claims, is no settlement. It is. at best a postponement of violence. As such, however, it may have obvious merits, and in any examination of the question how a conference may hope to settle disputes, this means of postponing the evil day will have to find its place.21. Two reasons can be imagined, either of which might induce a claimant to accept a settlement or agree to a postponement of a decision: (1) He may come to the conclusion that the point at issue is after all not really vital and therefore not worth a war ; or (2) however important the principles at stake may appear to him, he may be impressed, by the disastrous consequences to himself of a war which he sees no good prospect of winning. These are, of course, not necessarily alternatives which exclude each other. The first motive may well, in a given case, derive most of its strength from the presence of the second, and, in the absence of the second, the first might cease to operate. On the whole, the presence or absence of the second motive is likely to prove the dominant factor in most cases.22. It does no doubt happen that countries find themselves in a position where they seem to drift into hostilities without being really convinced that the vindication of their claims is imperative -   [488-1] -   C
even at the cost of war. Rival governments may in the heat of -controversy have pushed their conflicting claims with such warmth, they may have manoeuvred themselves, or allowed themselves to be manoeuvred, into such an impasse, that although the question at issue is even in their own eyes not really worth a war, yet national pride, a sensitive public opinion, perhaps words hastily spoken or written, may make it difficult spontaneously to recede or show willingness to come to terms.. Such situations are the opportunity of the friendly mediator, and it is in the r61e of the friendly mediator that a conference of the Powers may be expected to prove such value as it possesses.23.

As in thepast, the success of an aggressive State or combination, and thereforethe possibility of war, will depend, among other things, largely onthe judgment and skill of the leading statesman in correctlyappreciating and influencing to his advantage the grouping of thePowers, and in presenting his cause, rightly or wrongly, in such alight as to secure the sympathy and, perhaps, the assistance of some,whilst neutralising the possible hostility of the others.24. It is a matter of history that Bismark&apos;s great wars of 1864,    I differ.   The wars1866, and 1870 were brought about deliberately in accordance with of 1864 and 1866 coulda carefully planned policy.

On theother hand, had the international situation and the grouping ofthe Powers been unfavourable, had the forces hostile to Prussiandesigns been formidable enough to make Bismark doubtful as to thethe issue of an armed conflict, he would himself have held back.   Ineither case a conference..would have contributed nothing to theavoidance of war.25. In so far as the effective way to prevent war is to create the strongest possible combination of forces against any disturber of the peace, a field of helpful activity is opened &quot;for a system of general conferences if it succeeds in vigorously stimulating the policy of co-operation between nations for this purpose. A pledge to combine against any violation of a guaranteed territorial status quo goes a good way in this direction. As regards other causes of quarrel, a conference cannot directly force a solution, but it can facilitate conciliation and compromise, if only by affording time for discussion and scope for resourceful diplomacy. The: more it can be made a rule that, before appealing to the sword, nations should bring their
quarrels before a conference in which all are heard and none are coerced, the better will be the prospect of rival claims being peace-fully adjusted, and the stronger will grow the feeling that any Power embarking on war without previously pleading its cause ] do not claim sub- before a parliament of nations commits an offence against the com-stantialfy more   than munity of States, for which the penalty may be a general combinationthis.-.R.C. against the offender,26. But so much being said, it is important to fix the attention on the one dominating principle on which the whole structure of pacifism that has any pretension to being practical must be built up, and without&apos; which the whole fabric collapses at the first test of shock, like a house of cards. This is the compelling principle of the &quot; sanction&quot; ; in other words, the certainty that force will be applied to restrain evildoers. It is explicitly recognised in the scheme ; but the proposal to make the scheme palatable by suggesting blockade and boycott as the weapons to be more particularly employed, tends to obscure the fact that coercion ultimately means military action, bodily fighting. It is as useless as it would be dangerous to conceal this. Even if it be granted that commercial and financial pressure alone may suffice in the end to bring any modern State to its knees, it must not be forgotten that at best this requires time. What is there to prevent the time being utilized to invade, conquer, or paralyze the boycotting countries, or a sufficient number of them 1 The pressure is exercised by the bodies and brains of live persons. Kill, capture, or incapacitate these persons^ and their blockading and boycotting comes to an end.27. If therefore the State, or group of States, to be coerced possesses strong military forces and is prepared to use them, the opposing combination of Powers on their side must be in a position to overcome or contain those forces in good time. It is all a question of real military preponderance, 1 Such preponderance does not reside in mere numbers theoretically available. Organization ; readiness ; sufficiency of materials and supplies ; rapid means of communication ; unity of command; compactness of territory and favourable frontier lines; all these are elements which enter into the calculation of superiority and may, in combination, prove more than a match for numerically much larger forces composed of contingents of diverse nationalities, speaking different languages and obeying different sovereigns, not trained to act together or to follow a strange leader, separated, maybe, from one another by wide stretches of sea and land, and possibly divided by the interposition of enemy territory. Yet unless the forces at the disposal of the league of Powers are at the outset, and in fact during peace, established on such a footing, as regards both numbers and all other elements of military strength, as will ensure immediate and certain, not to say overwhelming, superiority on the decisive spot over any possible recusants in arms, there can be little confidence that the weaker and more exposed members of the general league will unhesitatingly stand to.their undertaking and risk their own safety in upholding the common cause.&apos; 28. The balance of power reappears as the fundamental problem. To prevent the possibility of any one State or group of States pursuing, through war and bloodshed, a policy of aggression and domination, nothing will serve but adequate force. Arbitrations and conferences have their uses, and serve their limited purposes. Their utility is likely to grow steadily with the development of modern political thought. But it is a necessary and preliminary condition of the proper functioning of general conferences as the guarantors of peace, that the community of nations has effectively organised force for the defence of the right. Whether and how this can be done, is primarily a military question.[488-1] D
29. It is no doiibt the consciousness of this necessity which has turned people&apos;s mind to the question of a limitation of armaments by common agreement. It is an attractive proposition that at any given moment the world would be as well off, and each nation as strong relatively to the rest, if all their existing armaments were, and remained, proportionately reduced, so that the balance of force, whatever it might be at the time, would be maintained. But so soon as any attempt is made to put this theory into practice, insuperable difficulties appear.30. A limitation of armaments is possible in three ways: (a) a numerical limitation of the units of force, that is, soldiers, guns, ships, aeroplanes, &amp;c.; (6) a limitation of the kind of force to be employed, such as prohibition of explosive bullets, of armed submarines or airships, of poisonous gases, of particular types of guns or torpedoes or explosives, &amp;c.; (c) a limitation of the amount of money to be spent annually on armaments.31. It can be shown that at any rate so long as these several kinds of limitation are not combined and employed together, even the primary object of maintaining the balance of force would not be attained.   A limitation of numbers and units presents, to start with, an extraordinarily complicated problem.   All modern States, except the United States, have adopted the principle of general and com-pulsory service.   How, under that system, can the number of soldiers be limited otherwise than by the size of the population?   It may be said that only so-and-so many, or such-and-such a proportion, shall be called to the colours.   But what does serving with the colours mean ?   What about passing successive batches of men into the reserves of various classes ?   What about swelling the numbers of trained men by shortening the term of service with the colours whilst intensifying the training; by extending the age limits for liability to serve; and by other devices of a similar kind ?   It is really impossible to conceive how the actual fighting strength repre-sented by the number of trained and partially trained men could be regulated except by minutely laying down the exact conditions on which every national army is to be organized and trained. This is hardly a feasible proposition.   But even supposing it was possible to give practical effect to it, the purpose would not be achieved.   For a limitation of numbers can always be counteracted by   qualitative  increases  in  the fighting values  of particular engines or methods of warfare.   As these relative fighting values vary with the progress of science and invention, an equilibrium could only be preserved by standardizing each kind of weapon and instrument, which would be quite impracticable.   Similarly, the prohibition or restricted scope of particular vehicles of force, imple-ments, or contrivances could be set off by the multiplication of others.   Again, the limitation of expenditure on armaments may become ineffective or immaterial as a result of the discovery or invention of simpler and less expensive methods of destruction. One maxim gun served by three men is in certain circumstances more formidable than  100 men carrying rifles, and certainly cheaper, and it is conceivable that a few big guns firing shells of special power may be a good substitute for parks of less effective artillery.32. To some extent these objections could be nut by insisting on the simultaneous application of all the three methods of limita-tion. But more serious difficulties remain to be overcome. They are twofold.33. There is, firstly, the question of general confidence in the good faith of all the parties. This confidence does not exist. There is good reason why it should not exist. History and the nature of things and men afford the explanation. Nor is there any prospect, that it will exist in the future. That being so, who is to see and guarantee that the limitations are really applied with scrupulous
honesty ? What is to prevent their being evaded or countered by the ingenuity of practical men, whose ideas about the sanctity of words written on scraps of paper may or may not be strictly puritanical ? It has been suggested that there might be an inter-national body exercising control in each country. But this only removes the difficulty one step further back. Who is to guarantee the honesty and efficiency of the international body; and how can individual governments or statesmen be prevented from hoodwinking the international body ? To these questions there is no satisfactory answer.34. The second objection is more fundamental. Any general limitation of armaments implies that every State accepts for itself a definite standard of force, not to be exceeded. This standard cannot be equal for all. The armaments of Montenegro cannot be the same as those of Russia. What should be the proportion of armed strength to be allotted to the several countries ? By what test should the different standards be measured and fixed : population, area, shipping, wealth, climate, geographical factors, or what ? It will be recognised, on reflection, that there is no abstract rule or system on which a proportionate standard could be based. There remains only the empirical method of accepting the existing distribution of force as indicating the normal, to be varied, il necessary, in such a manner as to preserve the same proportion between the different States.35. The existing proportionate distribution of force is the outcome of history, of past wars and territorial arrangements. It is the result of victories and defeats, of national achievements and of national disasters. At every given moment there are States who hope to retrieve past errors and misfortunes, and who strive to build upon stronger foundations the power of their nation. Such ambitions are natural and just. The nation that has them not is despised. To perpetuate indefinitely the conditions prevailing at a given time would mean not only that no States whose power has hitherto been weak relatively to others may hope to get stronger, but&apos; that a definite order or hierarchy must be recognissd, in which each State is fated to occupy a fixed place. Is this a condition which can be expected to meet with general acceptance ? And is the termination of a life-and-death struggle like the present war, which will presum-ably end in establishing a decided superiority of one side or the other, the appropriate moment for fixing the hierarchy of States according to the condition of their-respective armaments? Supposing the Central Powers to be absolutely defeated, are we to fix their propor-tion of permitted armaments at the figures resulting from such defeat ? It would be only fair to ask the question, What would be the attitude of our own country supposing for a moment that we were the defeated party ? No one can doubt that in such a calamitous contingency our enemies would insist on the practical disappearance of our fleet. What then should we think of a proposal to limit armaments on the basis of no fleet, or only a weak fleet, for England ? If forced to subscribe to such conditions, should we expect that future generations of Englishmen would feel themselves bound in honour to respect the sanctity of such an arrangement?36. Are we then, if victorious, to re-establish the proportions generally prevailing before the,war, and. so prolong or renew the conditions which made German aggression possible ? This alterna-tive need only be stated in order to be rejected. But would the other alternative of a standard based on the result of the present wTar be accepted by oUr enemies if they are utterly defeated ? And if forced to accept it, will they do so honestly, whole-heartedly, without any mental reservation ?37. At the same time, who will undertake to fix the standard of armed strength for China, for Holland, for Mexico, for the United
States? Can it be seriously believed that standards so fixed now could survive a general revolution in China, a quarrel over the Dutch . Indies between Holland and Japan, or an American invasion of Mexico ? Such events none of them improbable would scatter to the winds the papers on which the agreements for fixing the propor-tionate amounts of armaments had been written.38. If the objections here briefly indicated seem to render impossible under present conditions any general agreement for limiting armaments, there remains the remedy of specific agreements between particular States to reduce their own respective armaments independently of what the rest of the world does. Of all suggested remedies, this is the one that appears to be the simplest, and is probably the most dangerous. It is quite impossible to foretell what may even in the near future be the grouping of the Powers in the international arena. &quot; A&quot; may arrange with &quot; B &quot; for a mutual reduction of both their armies and navies, at a time when neither is seriously threatened by &quot; C,&quot; &quot; D,&quot; &quot; E,&quot; or &quot;F.&quot; But supposing &quot;C,&quot; &quot;D,&quot; &quot; E,&quot; and &quot;F,&quot; standing outside the agreement, begin seriously to increase their armaments and show a tendency to combine against &quot; A &quot; ? Is &quot; A &quot; to remain bound by his agreement with &quot;B&quot; not to increase his? And if such a dilemma, being foreseen as a possibility, must be taken into account at the outset, are the stipulations of the treaty between &quot;A.&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to be made contingent on the condition that nobod)&apos; else outside the agreement starts to increase his armaments ? If so, what practical security does the treaty give to either &quot; A &quot; or &quot; B &quot; ? If &quot; B&apos;s &quot; undertaking&quot; not to increase his armaments is contingent on what the rest of the world may do, who are free to do what they like, what easier for him should he so desire than to arrange with some outside Power to create the contingency which releases him from his obligation under the treaty with &quot; A&quot; ? Unless this reasoning can be shown to be faulty, it seems clear that nothing short of bringing all the Powers into the agreement will dispose of the dilemma; and therewith the only alternative solution of the limitation problem falls to the ground.39. There are strong and obvious reasons against inviting the Powers to enter into an agreement for any purpose, however humane and ideal, unless and until the way is seen clear to the achievement of that purpose by the adoption of some definite and thought-out plan. It is the conviction that no such plan can at present be suggested which impels me to urge most strongly that we should refrain from bringing forward again the question of a limitation of armaments, which has landed us in such embarrassing difficulties before.EYRE A. CROWE.October 12, 1916.The objections to any attempt to limit armaments are very powerfully put. On the whole I agree that nothing can be done at present. But it is possible that in future ages a public opinion will develop so strong against the settlement of disputes by war that armament will be reduced by common consent. The history of feudalism in England illustrates my meaning. The catastrophe of the Wars of the Poses led to the supremacy of the law.--R.C.o
