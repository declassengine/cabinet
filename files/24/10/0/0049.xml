SECBET. G.T. 449WAR CABINET. Brig.General Fairholme, Military Attache,Athens.Note on a conversation with General Sarrail, 23rd March, 1917.. &quot;General Sarrail, when I asked him how he thought matters were going in Old Greece as regards the execution of the demands contained in our ultimatum, exclaimed hotly:-&quot;Rien n&apos;est change.   On nous roule encore comme on l&apos;a fait tout le temps, quoique vous n&apos;avez tous pas voulu le croire.&quot;He said that the General Staff is organising bands in Thessaly, under Greek Officers,.and that military rifles and considerable stores of ammunition are concealed in villages on the Greek side of the frontier, in charge of Reservists.itHis troops now follow up&apos;such bands whenever possible, even into Greek territory beyond the neutral zone.He said that on more than one such occasion his troops had been fired bn from villages.   The culprits when caught are shot without trial.In one village the priest,, who was of Bulgarian origin, had been shot for concealing 10 rifles the existence of which he had denied after being warned of the consequences should any be found.     Similarly a Greek Reserve Officer had been shot, a loaded carbine having been found under his bed after he had denied having any arms.General Sarrail urges that we should insist on the organisers of bands, men whose names and movement, are well known, being handed over to us by the Greek Government for internment at Malta or Algiers.
He claims to have proofs of the complicity of the General Staff, and proposes to send them to Athens.   He would like the Ministers to obtain the dismissal of the heads on the ground that they are not carrying out the instructions of the Greek Government.   He considers that General Dousmaws and Colonels Strategos and Metaxas ought to &quot;be handed over to us for internment, failing which we shall never have peace in Greece.General Sarrail asserts that there are regiments left in Thessaly with as many as 10 Field officers and that a number of regular officers above the establishment agreed on are being retained for organising bands.He also asserts that arms and ammunition are being secretly removed from the Peloponnesus in boats, after being counted in by our Commission officers..He announced his intention of shooting, without trial, any Greek officers found with bands.He was very indignant about the handing over of grain to the Greek Government by the French and British Commercial Departments at Athens, and was convinced that this grain would not be given to the Starving poor, but would be used for the creation of new ^stocks&quot; for military purposes.   He asserted that quantities of grain are still stored in places in Thessaly, at the disposal of the General Staff.    In one place it appears that the French troops found a depot of medical stores^for the use of the wounded.General Sarrail is evidently very dissatisfied with the present situation as regards the measures taken to eliminate all power of the Greeks to do harm to our Salonika Armies, and I gathered that, even if no serious danger threatens from that quarter at this moment/he considers it intolerable that we should be subjected even to annoyance, at the bidding of a pro-German clique in Greece.%/
My impression was that General Sarrail, in advocating more drastic demands, is acting in perfect good faith, and not with a view to gratifying personal ambitions or furthering French Political aims.He did not even hint at the desirability of occupying Northern Greece.As regards the military operations, he expressed the hope that in a few days the Monastir neighbourhood would be cleared of the enemy who would be driven beyond long range artillery distance of the-town.(Initialled)  .W.E.F.Salonika.25th March, 1917.
