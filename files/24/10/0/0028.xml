11/4/17. QPERATl^QBS.From;-   General Hahbury Williams, To;- 0.1. G-. S .959. &apos; &apos; &apos;In continuation of my 955.    In order to get latest news as to spirit of troops on front, I called on General Klembowski.I said that (groups apparently omitted) of situation in Petrograd as far as I could (l group undecipherable) as telegraph to you.   His opinion he said was the same exactly as mine which he considered correct in every detail.As regards troops in front lines, he was very glad to s-ay that spirit is visibly improving through all armies, with increasing-irritation against the civilians who, in perfect; safety and comparative comfort, are agitating and idle, while the soldiers bear strain of fighting and intrigue.   He is con-    j &apos;   fident that is good sign, and deputations have been sent to workmen to impress point.I then spoke of importance of well advertising entry of America into War.      It seemed to me an obvious answer to malcontents to say proof of necessity for y defeating Germany is m the entry of America;     greatest republic in the world, and therefore greatest supporter to principles for which malcontents are now waiting for peace to be declared..    Klembowski entirely agreed, and said he would speak to Guchkof on latter&apos;s return from Divinsk -to-morrow, and hoped if opportunity offered I would do the same.I feel sure much could be done by spreading this gospel amiongst troops at front;    but especially amongst workmen, etc., and urged Klembowski that no time should he lost as we had already suffered incalculable loss of time and material most damaging to cause of Allies.He agrees with me absolutely.Entry of America not sufficiently boomed at preset and affects military situation with which I am concerned.In the same sense I have spoken privately to American Military Attache here.SECRET. G.T. 428WAR 0A3 WET.
