FOOD PRODUCTION SCHEME, IRELAND, 1917

Memorandum prepared in compliance with Chief Secretary&apos;s Minute of 17th March, 1917.

Week ending 18th April, 1917.

The following is a summary of the work of the Department in connection with the special Schemes for Increased Food Production in Ireland, set out under the main headings used in previous weekly summaries, viz:-

1. The administration of the Regulation enforcing compulsory tillage.

2. Local organisation through County Committees of Agriculture.

3. The working in conjunction with the Local Government Board, through Rural and Urban District Councils, of the Scheme of loans for seeds and manures for holdings not exceeding £10 valuation, labourers&apos; plots and town and other allotments.

4. Loans for agricultural implements.

5. Supply of motor tractors and ploughs.

6. Transit of farming requisites.

1.

No additional Warning Notices have been issued since the date of the last report.

Of the 8,561 cases in which such Notices were issued, 3,300 cases have now been reported as satisfactory. The others are at present under investigation.

The Department have not exercised their powers of entry in respect of any holding since the date of previous report, but such action is contemplated in the case of over 100 holdings in addition to those referred to in that report.

The total number of cases in which inspections of holdings have been arranged for the purpose of securing compliance with the Regulation is 1,380. 
2.

The County organisation is being turned to the work of inducing farmers to order, without delay, supplies of spraying machines and materials. Local suppliers are being urged to lay in stocks of these.

The shortage of manures continues.

3.

The work of the delivery and inspection of the seeds and manures required in connection with the working of the scheme of loans for holdings not exceeding £10 valuation, labourers&apos; plots and town and other allotments has now been completed.

4.

During the past week 52 fresh applications for loans for agricultural implements were received. The total value of machinery ordered to date under this scheme is now £25,813.

5.

The work of the Motor Tractor Section of the Department so far as the spring ploughing is concerned is drawing to a close, but a good deal of ploughing is still in progress. The average amount of work done by the tractors per day is increasing and the quality of the work improving, as the men get more accustomed to machines.

6.

Two officers of the Department were engaged during the week at the Port of Dublin and the Dublin Railway Stations in expediting the conveyance of agricultural requisites. Two officers performed similar duties at Northern Stations. Special attention was
was given to the work of facilitating the conveyance of seed potatoes required by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.

During the week ten agricultural tractors and nine tractor ploughs were received at the Port of Dublin.

Seed Potatoes for England

Of the 8,000 tons of seed potatoes to be exported to England, consignments amounting in all to 5,244 tons have now been despatched. A further cargo of 1,500 tons is at present being loaded, and the balance will be shipped by the end of the present week.

Flaxseed Supply

Further quantities of flaxseed have been imported from Holland, the total delivery being considerably in excess of anticipations. The quality of the seed is, however, rather poor.
