It is not clear whetherthis provision is intended to mean;--a. A Repayment to the Shipowner by the Government should profits he reduced below pre-war level.orb. A payment hy the shipowner to the Government should profits he above the pre-war level.If the former (a)    it will in effect he a Government guarantee of Shipowners Profits, a policy which on public grounds is open to objection,  end is likely to arouse parliamentary and public hostility.If as is probable the clause is intended to provide for a return to the Government of an agreed proportion of the profits made,  the two alternatives would work out somewhat as foil o&apos;A&apos;SCLAUSE   9    ( iii)Firs b       ernative:    A Return of Income to %3 made represen-ting &quot;X per cent&quot; of- the difference between:^(a) The profits of the underoakingand(b) An individual pre-war standard profit special to theShipping Industry.^fiiP-S^^^t^T^tive,;   A&apos;.Return of Income to be made represen-ting &apos;.!:Y per cent:i of the difference &quot;between a-

-A-The objection to both&apos;those alternatives is that the excess profits retained &apos;hy the Shipowner will continue to rise on the agreed percentage, however great such profits may be.As an instance of the danger of this one British Steamship Co. with pre-war pre fits of  88,000, made in the year en&amp;ing 30th, June, 1916,  518,000, the capital being unchanged.     Had this Company been allowed  0$ of its excess profits, it would have retained  174,000 or just double the profit it made before the War.It is suggested that whether Alternative I or Alternative 2 be adopted, the following proviso shall be added :.-&quot;But provided that in no case shall the profits &quot;retained by the Shipowner (subject to allowances &quot;for increased capital) be more than 20$ in excess &quot;of the pre-war proi.il;,&quot;With such a proviso, -the Company instanced above could not, under any circumstances, retain more than  106,000 viz its pre-war profit plus 2C% on same-.Such a proviso would bring Shipowners into line with Y/orks controlled by the Munitions Department.
