WAR CABINET.ENTRY OF SPAIN I1T THE VVAR.^---^---a---       . ;Copies of Tel^rajas^froiL jjga,. Yaughan to L ca Balfour &quot;11th &amp; 12th. April&quot;; 1917,(I). . .Urfiont.April 11th,Host Secret and Personal,A few days ago ETench Ambassador had long interview with Count Romanones and discussed position created for Spain &quot;by entry of United States into the war.Count Romanones agreed that if she maintained her present position she would certainly sink to level of an insignificant power like Netherlands and finally said that moment had come when she. could no longer remain neutral and that in the course of a day or two he would make n public declaration of policy in tho sense that she must come in on the side of the Allies and that if his advice were disregarded he would resign.     He said so called blockade of Croat Britain was really a blockade cf Spain;   He added that the King-of Spain1s position was difficult as he was surrounded by pro-Germans and also owing to his Austrian family connections, but that His Majesty had full confidence in him.Eronch Ambassador discussed the question this morning with Minister of State who said that there was no question of a Einisterial crisis on internal issues but with reference to International situation with which Spanish Government was greatly preoccupied and that was a matter on which a decision could not be taken without careful and mature deliberation,This makes Erench Ambassador think that either Count Romanones1 pronouncement maj bo somewhat delayed or that lliiiister of State is not fully acquainted with his chiefs intent ions 0Minister of State held similar language to me this morning.French Ambassador saw Count Romanones again this afternoon who spoke of pro-*Ally press and askocl Erench Ambassador whether he could not use his influence with it to prepare public opinion in his favour with&apos;a view to Its supporting him fully in such action as he might take0   French Ambassador again infers from tfeis that he may delay his statement of policy or be meeting with some opposition on the part- of other members of his Cabinet,,Count Romanones said that the Eing now shares his views,In discussing situation question cf Tangier aroso and Count Romanones gave French Ambassador to understand that Spills wanted itu
1-   2    -rI gathered from French Ambassador that French Military Authorities aro fully conscious of the value at present juncture of unrestricted use of Spanish ports for Allied ships of war...Another consideration is that France would bo relieved of considerable anxiety in regard to Morocco and present Gorman intrigues carried on in Spanish zone and might be able to release some of her troops in French zone.Were Spain to brealc off diplomatic relations with.the central powers moral effect would of course be enormous and would no doubt&quot;cause any South American states still wavering to do likewise.Tho inconvenience would arise that it might be difficult to find a neutral power to take charge of our interests in enemy countries but this is presumably not insuperable.It is of course possible that Count RomanonesTs declaration of policy might not meet&apos;with support in tho country or lead to an .internal split.   Much would of course depend on attitude of the army which We have every reason to believe is largely imbued with pro-German s^napathies.I venture to suggest desirability of rapidly deter-mining, after considering matter in all its bearings, whether His Majesty1s Government wish,&quot;or not, to encourage abandonment by Spain of her neutrality, and I should be   -grateful for your early instructions as to language I should hold if sounded on the subject.If, as I presumo, His Majesty1s Government and French Government decide on a common attitude towards this oventuality, it would be useful for both Embassies to have (? urgent) instructions which would &quot;enable them to act in close harmony and collaboration.CIIiCuXAKlI) TO THE hTITG AUD WAR CABINET. Dooypher.   Mr. Vaughan (Madrid) to Mr, Balfour,&quot;        &quot;    &quot;  &quot;       April 12th, 1917, r,ll,30, a.m,Ho, - (3 ) .Personal and most secretftMy. telegram personal and secret of to-day, April 11th.French Ambassador begged me to respect his confidence as to -what passed between him and Count Bomanoncs on ciuestion of Tangier and I promisod that I i/ould be most discreet.   I omitted, it from-my previous telegram.
Count Romanones asked him would France agree to give Tangier to Spain..; . French Ambassador&apos; replied that he realised ,that in diplomacy, as in commerce there must ho a auid prcfjquo.   He could not - speak for hi s Government hut thought:Count Homanones should formulate concrete proposals,. As&apos;a matter of fact France had no right to dispose of Tangier and all eho could do if favourably disposed would be to agree to use her influence with parties interested to secure this end,&apos;    It would moreover perhaps be possible to recognise independence of Spanish zone in Morocco.. &apos;I understand Count Homanones- will make proposals through.. Spanish/Ambassador in: Paris,,Please do not. Inform French&apos; Government of what passed at interview in regard to Morocco,.
