From Sir P. Cox, 7th April 19] 7,(Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India, andPolitical, Basra.)(Received at 9 p.m.)T. 1049. Your telegram 416 S. of 1st April repeating Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of 29th. March for the future administration of Mesopotamia. I beg to offer following observations in regard to details : 1. No comment needed from me. 2. I agree.3. Ruler will (sic ? not) be acceptable or feasible as I know of no outstanding personality who could fill part. An Administrative Council presided over by High Commissioner seems best solution, either one for each vilayat or a combined one for both vilayats.4 (a). I agree that the territory should be administered in accordance with existing laws and institutions, and I am moreover convinced that there would be great advantage in having uniform codes for Basra and Baghdad and other Arab provinces under foreign rule or protection. The Iraq code has served its purpose well, but it is admittedly provisional and revocable on the conclusion of war, and whatever be the. final political status of Basra, there seems to be no essential reason why systems established in both vilayats should not be assimilated/ It must be&apos; remembered that Turkish judicial system included final reference to Constantinople for which substitute must be found by creation of High Court of Mesopotamia with final appealto Privy Council. Incidentally also the civil and criminal codes and land laws will require considerable amendment and adjustment of wording to make them interpretable at all.- As regards substitution of Arab for Turkish personnel, there is not sufficient indigenous material available at present, but it can gradually be created.4 (b). Tribal system of government already adopted where suitable, and no objection to provincial and local councils.4(c). I agree in principle.4 (d). I agree in proposition, but for duration of war -we must have some latitude, especially in regard to clerical establishments. Urgent require-ments of Expeditionary Force and military administration cannot wait, and have to be met by the most expeditious means possible.5. Of course in principle it would be much more satisfactory to have the Basra and Baghdad Vilayats administered on one covering (?) system both in regard to principle and detail. But I know that on the one hand we cannot annex both, and on the other hand the importance-of annexing Basra makes it necessary to put up with certain disadvantages which that course may involve. I feel convinced, however, that no attempt to differentiate funda-mentally in regard to working principles and details of two administrations will produce satisfactory results, and that they- should be so similar as to be indistinguishable in the&quot; working. The difference would be one of technical political status and nomenclature which need not make itself felt on the spot. To attempt to run the two vilayats, which are from every point of view inseparable, on conflicting lines and inconsistent with principle (nine groups -undecipherable).6. No comment or objection.7. Nejef; and Kerbela should not be treated as an enclave cut off from advantages resulting to united Mesopotamia from enlightened Government, which advantage inhabitants anticipate with lively expectation and will assuredly demand.   They should be organised as independent townships as
2far as municipal administration is concerned; while unable at present to form an opinion as to irrigation, river conservancy, navigation, posts, telegraphs and railways, they should come under united Mesopotamia administration controlled by High Commissioner. Limits of townships would be existing limits of sacred territory round shrines.Both towns should .be represented on Mesopotamian Administrative Council which would combine Vilayat Councils of both Vilayats and would sit at Baghdad. The divergent local and tribal interests of each vilayat would blend or fall into their true perspective in this Council and Indian immigration and cognate questions would be more easily disposed of &quot;since the right of united administration to regulate such questions in accordance with need of whole countiy would be unquestionable.The towns themselves, apart from precincts of the Holy Places, have&quot; always been open to Europeans and w-ould continue to be so in future, but any officials which the Government or the Municipalities intend to place in residence there should be Mohammedans agreeable to communities concerned. -8. I entirelv concur. These are two vital matters and incalculable harm may be done by injudicious or inexpert handling of them.9 and 10. No comment.11. I am strongly of opinion that sphere of Government of-India in Persia should include whole of present neutral zone phis farthest limit of Kermanshah and Ispahan if possible.12. It will be seen from the foregoing that I generally accept and agree with the lines of policy contemplated by War Council. The task of carrying it out if one of no little difficulty Avould be one of great interest, and were I called upon to inaugurate it at the psychological moment I feel I could enter on it whole heartedly, and suppose, for a moment, that. His Majesty&apos;s Government did or were to contemplate entrusting me with task I should highly appreciate compliment and confidence which it would imply, but I should let them know now, as the Government of India are already aware, that while anxious like anybodj&apos;-else to see the war through in whatever sphere my services could be most usefully employed, I have never desired and do not desire to remain in this country after the waiyand, moreover, I feel sure that new policy stands a better chance if it were inaugurated by official who is going to remain and see it taking shape.Both Army Commander and I, however, are strongly of opinion that when His Majesty&apos;s- Government contemplate formally introducing above principles during the existence of martial law, and while the military position of Baghdad is as it is (namely, that we are in almost daily conflict with Arab tribes ahead of us, and that unless determined Russian advance is made, of which at present there is no evidence, we must expect severe fighting around. Baghdad when enemy has had time to recover and concentrate fresh troops against us), they are taking too much for granted, and are making demands upon us which may at any time, and in many particulars, be incompatible both with the military interests at stake and the freedom of action of Army Commander, whose Chief Political Staff Officer I am. At same time His Majesty&apos;s Government may rest assured that I accept their policy in principle, and that as long as I am here I will proceed on the spirit of it as far as possible and do nothing which I can avoid either in principle or in detail to prejudice its complete inauguration when the time comes. Army Commander desires me to convey similar assurance on his behalf.
13. For the present I recommend that Chief Political Officer be permitted to carry on according to his lights in consultation with Army Commander as heretofore, and that as soon as conditions permit, say at the beginning of next cold weather, a Commission of first-class men be spared to examine whole problem on the spot, and make detailed recommendations as basis on which future policy can be formulated. Premature conclusions arrived at now may do irreparable damage, and it is submitted that only greatest emergency can justify hasty decision by War Cabinet before His&quot; Majesty&apos;s Government are in possession of complete facts and details regarding Baghdad Vilayat.From Viceroy, Foreign Department, 5th April 1917. (Received at India Office, 9 p.mASecret. Your telegram of the 29th ultimo. Future administration of Mesopotamia and Arabia. Owing to move of Government to&quot; Simla and several members being on tour, we shall be unable to telegraph our considered views in less than 10 days,, on these important proposals, far-reaching effects of which wre fully realise.From Sir P. Cox, 8th April 1917.(Addressed to Foreign and repeated to Secretary of State for India andPolitical, Basra).(Received at India Office, 6 a.m., 9th.)T. 1062. Reference to telegrams from the Secretary of State, dated 30th March and 8th April. May I please be informed of names, ages, and number of years&apos; service of proposed Judicial Adviser and the two sub-ordinate Revenue Officers ? I presume they are all Englishmen and belong to Civil Service. A. competent Judicial Adviser is already available in Colonel Ivnox, who has had two 37ears&apos; experience of local judicial needs and ideas, and as it is common ground that Irak Code is not to be introduced and as he is quite prepared to work on the lines indicated by His Majesty&apos;s Government, it seems superfluous, apart from Colonel Knox&apos;s personal claims to consideration, to introduce another legal luminary. On the other hand, couple of capable junior judicial Officers who could assist him in over-hauling Turkish codes would no doubt be very useful. As regards Brigadier-General Clayton, his services would at any time be most.valuable to me as well to Government, but I suggest that his designation be not decided until His Majesty&apos;s Government have had time to consider views of Army Commander and myself as conveyed in my telegram 1049 dated 7th April.
