JL J. SSECRET &apos;9Oo 1/94-/272,Copy No2.NOTE ON A PROPOSAL TO OCCUPY LARISSA,At the.-.megting of the War Cabinet on 12th April, I was requested by the Prime Minister to state my views on a proposal to occupy Larissa with a view to-protecting the left flank and coimnuni cat ions of the Allied forces at Salonika and to increasing the influence of M. Veneselos in Greece.     I do not know what is the policy of His Majesty5s Government with regard to Greece, but from a military standpoint the situation is as follows :-As the War Cabinet are aware the greater part of the Greek Army have been transferred to the Korea, where there arc now over 20,000 troops, 460 guns, 182 machine guns and 236,567 rifles.     There remain in Northern Greece only 9,620 men of whom about 2,000 are stationed, in Thessaly and about 2,000 in Epirus,     These numbers are estimated to be the minimum required to maintain order in the country and. are wholly insufficient to constitute any serious danger to the communications of the Allied, forces.   There 1 are, it is true, large numbers cf reservists scattered over the country who may be in possession of arms and of a certain amount of ammunition, although they/ wn ucan have no army rifles as these have all been transferred to the iiorca.
In connection with the possibility of hostilities on the part of these elements I state! in a paper dated . the 2nd January dealing with the situation in the event of war with Greece, that &quot;operations in this area (viz. against the Allied left flank and rear) would be greatly hampered by lack of transport..   The roads are few and bad and the only form of transport available would be a kind of two-wheeled cart, of which the district could only supply a limited number.   From luarissa the main line of operations to the nearest point .of the Salonika Monastlr railway is about 90 miles and to maintain a large force at this distance from their base would, under these circumstances, be impossible ........ The problembefore the Allies would be therefore to deal with attacks on their lines of communication &quot;by forces of not more than a few thousand men who would be little more than p:uerilias-&quot;    It was pointed out in conclusion that our best course of action to guard against such a possibility was &quot;to undertake such limited operations against the Greek forces as will effectively secure our left flank and communications from attack.    To thrust troops into the hills of Thessaly against a swarm of well-armed guerillas could do.no good and would be merely playing the enemyrs game 0&quot;Since these words were written the situation has greatly improved owing to the withdrawal of the Greek Army to the iiorea, the danger of attack has consequently decreased, and the security of the railway can be adequately ensured as at present by a comparatively small detachment of Allied troops.From this point of view therefore an advance to larissa would serve no purpose whatever and would be a useless dispersion of force.
Moreover, as stated in the above mentioned paper, any such advance would be highly undesirable for ether reasons,    In another paper; dated 29th January,  dealing with a proposal on the part of the French Government to occupy Volo as an additional base for the Salonika Army, I pointed out that &quot;the line from Larlssa to- Monastic passes through difficult hilly country inhabited by armedGreek Reservists who might at any moment become hostile......t.The railway is vulnerable at a number of points and would require careful guarding which would entail the employment Df a considerable number of troops&quot;,while therefore there is no reason to suppose thatany great difficulty would be encountered in overcoming such resistance as might be offered to an advance on Larissa and the occupation of that place, this operation would require a large number of troops both:&apos; to deal with the irregular Greek forces who might oppose the advance and to protect the Allied communications.This course of action would however probably involve even more serious consequences.    It would mean that we were determined to force Greece into war by 9ponly espousing the cause of Mr Venizelos against the King and the present Governmentc   Such a step could hardly fail to create widespread opposition in the country and would probably drive the Government into resistance.   We must in this case be prepared to deal with a rising in Athens and with an attempt on the part of the Greek Army to escape from the Morea,   This would mean despatching considerable forces both to Athens and Corinth and would lead inevitably to the occupation and subjugation of the whole country.Such
Such a situation must greatly increase the strain on our shipping resources, and in this connection I would remind the war Cabinet that Sir John Jellicoe has stated that &quot;It is exceedingly doubtful whether it will be in the least degree possible to cope with the figures&quot; given by me as regards the number of sick alone, whom we may have to provide for during the coming Summer.   Vie should have, in-the circumstances contemplated above, to open a number of additional, bases on the Greek coast, while the number of troops required for these operations would probably be so large that it would be impossible to continue our offensive on the Macedonian front with any hope of success.I must further add that as the result of constant &apos;and careful consideration of the enemy^s general plans, and intentions, the General Staff have recently come to the conclusion that he is mainly relying upon his submarines to force us to make peace and any additional strain put upon our naval and shipping resources will, of course^ make this object easier of attainment.To sum up, an advance on Larissa would serve no mill tary purpose, it would involve us in commitments, the extent of which it is not possible to foresee,  it might entail war with Greece and may necessitate measures for the occupation the whole of - that country.-   I have no information as to the details of the French proposals, but they could not fail to impose upon us a strain which T have no hesitation in saying, we cannot meet, more especially so In view of the present situation in Russia and the probable demands of Italy.   Apart from the possibility of detaching Bulgariafrom
(5Ufrom the Central-Powers, which itself is somewhat remote, there is no way in which operations in tho Balkans can be expected to contribute to the defeat of the enemy, and this must bo recognised by the \,ar Cabinet in considering the question of extending the sphere of our operations into Greece.\i.
