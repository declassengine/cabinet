SECRET0,1/95/2,75,COPY HO,xNote &quot;by the Chief -of the ImperiarVCTener-al Staff on the Memorandum by the First Sec. Lord regarding &quot;Protection of Shipping in the Mediterranean&apos;5 01, The opinion of the General Staff with respect to theSalonika Expedition is already known and need not he repeated, here.   It has always been to the effect that it is impossible to maintain and employ there a sufficient force to exert a decisive influence on the war in our favour.     Apart from such political necessity as there may be for supporting Serbia and the Venezolists, the.only justification for still keeping large Allied forces in Macedonia is the remote chance of striking Bulgaria such a blow as will make her seek a separate peace.     As against this remote advantage must be placed the situation in Russia, with the consequent possibility of enemy divisions being sent from that front to th.6 Western.., Italian or Salonika front,       This possibility renders it more essential than ever that we should withdraw our troops from Salonika and so make them available for employment in a more useful theatre, and one in 7&apos;hich they can be properly maintained,2*. The  easiblMty of keeping open our sea communicationsis the determining &quot;factor, and according to the First Sea Lord&apos;s Memorandum this.feasibility does not exist.In
2. \In all our oversea theatres, not wholly excepting Prance, the maintenance of our forces is being greatly hampered by inadequate shipping facilities, and it seems certain that, unless something is done to remedy the present shipping situation, our operations in the near future may be seriously affected.3. General Sarrail has postponed his contemplatedoffensive from early this month to the 24th, and for all I know to the oontrary he may further postpone it.    I ooneider that he should be ordered to commence it not later &quot;&quot;than the date he has now fixed - that is, if he thinks it oan be undertaken at all with a reasonable chance of success.   Unless the result of these operations - if they take place - is such as clearly to promise the early collapse of Bulgaria,  the shipping situation would appear to demand the withdrawal of our troops at the earliest possible date.    The remainder of the Allied forces,  if retained in the country, should then revert to thS original role of the defence tf the town and harbour of Salonika,  and for this purpose they should be sufficient. They number in all some 300,000 men.W.R.ROBERTSOU. 17/4/1917. CI.G.6.
