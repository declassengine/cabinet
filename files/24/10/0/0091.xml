P,    Prom General Hanbury Williams to C..I..G..S.,,16/4/17,073,     Your 32689.I fully recognise how important is definite conclusion mentioned in first, and divesting one&apos;s mind of the clap-trap referred ts in . the fourth paragraph *It is on the other hand, in tho present unsettled, state j. somewhat difficult to come to any definite conclusion,-, and I give you my views from a. general consideration of tha pros and cons.   They are as follows:-In my opinion we cannot count upen any offensive of importance cither in Caucasus or Europei by the Russian Army.   Lly reasons for this are as follows; first, Government, though gaining strength, is still driven by force of circumstances to take up a weak attitude in the matter of discipline, and relations between the officers and men are either those of-officers making up to men so as to weaken discipline, or of men asserting themselves to such a degree as to render discipline an impossibility; second, serious delay which has taken placo with regard to work on railways and in factories makes position such that only extraordinary revolution of feeling or a very strong hand oan make up for timej third, entry of U..S.A., though useful., will take a long time before it can have any practical effect on the Russian situation: it is shown as a result of the conference that railways and ports had as much as they could do to manage tho supplies we propose to send and ?from orders from America.I should accordingly,be prepared to count on Russia only for defensive action, and shall be glad if they can retain a oertain number of German troops anyhow on this front.My considered views are as above and without being pessimistic, I see no prospect which.warrants advising you to rely on Russian forces naval and.military.,Later. Since drafting above, I have seen AlexGiff and have repor-ted
ted the result of my interview with him in a separate telegram.   You will see what he says, but I regret that I, am unable to alter my own views as expressed above.He has been misled previously as to the situation in the Caucasus, and I have no confidence in the situation both as regards artillery and aviation.
