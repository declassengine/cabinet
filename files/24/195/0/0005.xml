SSCR1T.                 CABINET.O.P.155 (28).            SPEED LI1IITB.            Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.              By Regulations  made under the Motor Car  Acts,  IG96,  and     1903,  heavy motor cars (i.e. motor cars exceeding 2-tons in weight     unladen)  are limited to  a maximum speed of 12 miles per hour  and to     a maximum speed of 5 miles per hour if drawing a  trailer.  There has     been no change in this respect since the Heavy Motor Car Orders were     first made in 1904.  Motor omnibuses and motor coaches fall into the     category  of heavy motor  cars and are, therefore,  subject to the speed     limit of  12 miles per hour.  It is, of course, a  matter of common     knowledge that the ordinary speeds at which vehicles of this  type     travel now greatly exceed the limit imposed by the Regulation.              In the Draft Road Traffic Bill which I published and     circulated on the instructions of the Cabinet early last year,     I proposed that the maximum speed limit for heavy motor cars     fitted with pneumatic tyres should be raised to 2q miles per  hour     and to 16 miles per hour if the heavy motor car was drawing a     trailer,  and all the wheels, both of the drawing  vehicle and     of the trailer, were fitted with pneumatic tyres.  Up to the     present I have been reluctant to make this change by an amendment     of the Regulations, as it seemed to me  &quot;referable to postpone     the making of amending Regulations until the Draft Roa-d Traffic     Bill had become law and  I was in a better position to deal     comprehensively with the control of road traffic, not only in the     matter of speeds but also in many other important respects.              I have recently received strong representations from     the organisations representing the owners of motor omnibuses and     motor coaches that the question, of revising the  maximum speeds     at any rate, should no longer be postponed.  It is pointed, out     that the  present maximum speed of 12 miles per hour is out of     date and entirely unsuited to modern conditions.   The Home
Secretary, on the other hand, has been attacked on the subjectof the excessive speeds at which motor coaches are allowed to travel.  . To quote a single instance, motor coaches are scheduledto run from Newcastle to London, a distance of 275 miles,  in12 hours, with an interval of one hour for lunch en route.   this represents an average running speed of 25 miles per, hour.    to attain this average speed the vehicles must,  at times,  run at40 miles an hour or over, a speed which is far in excess of anything that can be regarded as reasonable for vehicles of this type on the public roads.   The difficulties of the Police are undoubtedly increased by the fact that the legal speed limit is so absurdly low that its strict enforcement is out of the  question.Prom this point of view I understand that the Home Secretary isin agreement with myself that some increase in the legal speed    ,limit for certain types of motor omnibuses and motor coaches wouldbe desirable, and that such a step would assist the police indealing with cases where these vehicles are driven at dangerousspeeds.          If the Cabinet agree that action should now be takenin this direction without waiting for the passing of the PraftRoad Traffic Bill, I would propose to limit the concession tovehicles fitted with pneumatic tyres, on the ground that vehiclesso equipped can travel at a higher speed without serious damage to the roads.   This would be in harmony with the proposals whichare to be included in the Pinanoe Bill,  and which have  been announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech,to allow a rebate of 20 per cent, in the licence duties of heavymotor cars fitted with pneumatic tyres.    This proposal has beenreceived with general approval and a concession with regard to speed would form an additional inducement to owners and manufacture-turers to fit pneumatic tyres to these heavy vehicles.
(Intd. ) W,A.         I wish, therefore, to seek the authority of theCabinet to make a Regulation raising the maximum speed limit for heavy motor cars fitted with pneumatic tyres from 12 to20 miles per hour, and the speed limit for heavy motor oarsdrawing a trailer, where both the vehicle and the trailer arealso fitted with pneumatic tyres from 5 to 16 miles per hour.
