Copy No.  &amp;y(fROYAL COMMISSION on LAND DRAINAGE.in ENGLAND AND WALES.Memorandum, by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries *1.This Royal Commission, which was appointed on March 22nd,1927, on the authority of the Cabinet  [Cabinet 6  (27) of February2nd, 1927 1  presented Its report  (Cmd.2993) in December last.  Itssubmission to the Cabinet has been purposely delayed pending theannouncement of the Budget proposals, but it is desirable that consideration should be now given to the recommendations containedas  regards Land  Drainage  and  of  the  steady deterioration  ofagricultural  land that has  continued unchecked  since  the  question ofland  drainage was investigated by  a  Select Committee  of the House ofLords in 1877.   They lay  great stress  on (a)  the  chaotic  characterof  the present law relating to Land  Drainage;  (b)  the limitation ofthe powers possessed by existing authorities; and (c) the largenumber of such authorities  and the absence of any co-ordination of effort among  them.  They  consider  that if the present state ofaffairs is allowed to continue,  further deterioration of  considerableareas of land at present  in need of  drainage must inevitably  follow.3.         In these circumstances  it Is not surprising that therecommendations  of the Commission  are  of a most drastic and far-reaching character, and strike at  the  root of  the present basis ofland  drainage law.  For the sake of  brevity,  the  main recommendations are set out  in  the attached schedule,  and some  comments are added on those which  affect the Ministry  of Agriculture  and Fisheries  most directly.4.          In the light of  the Commission&apos;s recommendations,  it 13essential that  the Government should take early steps to  provide foran Improvement  in the existing state of affairs,  especially as  thein the Report without further delay.2.The Commission take a gloomy view of the present position
present crucial financial position of many Drainage Author! ties Ais from time to time rendered more difficult by the incidence ofsuch unusual floods as occurred, not only recently In the thames estuary and elsewhere on the East Coast, hut also in the lateautumn of last year on the.West Coast of England and Wales.5.         I    accordingly ask the sanction of the Cabinet tothe preparation of a Bill to give effect to the recommendations ofthe Commission.  The Bill will necessarily take a considerable time to draft in view of its far-reaching effect, and some drasticmodification of the Commission^ recommendations may be foundnecessary in view of the Budget proposals as regards de-rating.In any case, it will be necessary for a large amount of surveyingwork to be carried out before any 3111 can be passed, and this islikely to take at least two years.  No move, however, can be madeIn this direction (and it is essential to take the fullestadvantage of the summer months) until the Cabinet have decided upon the principle of introducing a Bill,  Moreover, it is all-important that I should be able to inform parties who are constantly addressing questions to me, that the Government havedefinitely decided upon the Introduction of a Bill at some later date.6.         It is necessary to add one word on the subject of Statefinancial assistance.  For centuries past, arterial drainage hasbeen carried out without such assistance; but it must be rememberedthat not long ago large grants were made in aid of land drainageschemes designed to relieve unemployment, and more recently provision has been made for the expenditure of  1,000,000 in aid of more comprehensive schemes.  Most of this provision, in addition to afurther  625,000 promised to the Ouse scheme (at present in abeyance), has already been hypothecated to various schemes.  TheRoyal Commission are extremely guarded in their remarks on thissubject, but they definitely state that, even If comprehensiveauthorities are set up with rating powers over a wide area. It willprobably still be necessary for State assistance to be provided Iflarge and necessary outfall works are to be carried out.
           In  any  case, however,  the question of Governmentcontributions  cannot  possibly be  settled until general legislation has been passed,  and  the  catchment area authorities have not  onlybean set up, but have surveyed  their areas and decided what works are necessary  and  what sort  of  a  charge they involve over  the area,having regard  to  the  enlarged area of  rating.  It must therefore begeveral years  before  the  question of Government assistance of thenature visualised  by  the  Royal  Commission can mature, and  I can see no reason for  deferring a decision on  this account on the  main question as to new legislation.   But,  in the meantime, I proposeto reserve altogether the question of  Government assistance,  andI desire authority to prepare a Bill without prejudice to  that question, which can be considered with the Treasury later, whenit arises.  In any case,  I do not propose to deal with the pointin the Bill.                                        Vt .G.stry of  Agriculture  and Fisheries. May, 1928.
9 a,*3 &amp;SCHEDULE.RflrtommendationsThere should, in each catchmentarea requiring land drainage,(these areas to be Scheduled toany Bill) be a supreme authority which should have sole charge ofthe main river.The  rating area for drainagepurposes should be extended tocover  the whole of the catchmentarea,  and the cost of main channelworks  (at present, where  any authority exists, met entirely bythe  lands held to be benefited bythese  works) should be apportionedamong  the rate-payers of  the wholecatchment area, a differentiationbeing  made between lowland andupland areas.The powers  (where  existent)  of        3.existing  drainage  authorities inrelation  to  the &quot;main channels,should  be transferred to  theCatchment Area Authority.  Allinternal  authorities should  be  re-organised under  the  control  of  theCatchment Area Authority,  Commission-ers of  Sowers and  obsolete ormoribund  authorities being abolished and replaced where necessary bynew elective -authorities.Catchment Area  Authorities  should    4.precept on the  County Councils fortheir funds,  but the rates  ofinternal authorities should be collected through the local ratingauthorities,  instead of, as atpresent, by the Drainage authorities themselves.Agricultural land should receivethe same treatment as regardsdrainage rates levied to pay formain channel works, as It receivesfor ordinary rates; that Is to say,on the basis of existing relief to agricultural land, drainage rates should be levied on agricultural land at one-quarter its rateable value, and on other hereditamentsat their full value.  There is,however, no question here of anybalance being made up by means ofan Exchequer Grant.  The whole cfthe money required for drainageshould be found from agricultural land  (rated as at present at                                -4-Remarks.There will no doubt beopposition to what will beregarded as an addition tothe number of existing localauthorities *The &quot;uplanders&quot; - hithertoexempt - will object to thepayment of drainage rates;and this objection will be especially strong in thecase of the large urban areas who have hitherto notcontributed a penny towardsthe evacuation of uplandwaters.Old-established authorities,aoting under private legis-lation and Commissioners ofSewers, may possibly object,but their feelings ought notto stand in the way of theuniformity and co-ordinationof. effort which is one of themost pressing needs.This will require carefulworking out, with theassistance of the Ministryof Health.       It is not,however, Intended that thenumber of rating authoritiesshould be increased.Drainage rates are at presentleviable either on acreage orannual value.   speaking generally, there Is a decidedtendency towards levying them on acreage. Where, however,a drainage authority hasdecided to levy its rates onthe basis of annual value, Ithas been usual to levy them on agricultural land at its full value, and upon otherhereditaments upon one-thirdvalue.The Royal Commission now recommended that all drainage
iu-quarter) and other rateable ieditaments (rates at full value).ae general Land Drainage Lawliould be consolidated andiiended.rates should be levied onannual value, and that theyshould be levied on the basisof agricultural land one-qj arter, and other hereSita-ments&quot; full^ value for mainchannel works o &quot;&quot;Rates leviedby the remaining internalauthorities will stillcontinue to be levied on thepresent basis where thoserates are leviable on annual value.The levying of drainage rates on annual value is more inaccordance with the modernprinciples of rating and hasmuch to recommend it.  On theother hand, the shifting of themain burden of rates for mainchannel works from agriculturalto non-agricultural heredita-ments will require carefulconsideration, especiallyhaving regard to the likelyeffect of the rating proposalsvisualised in the Budget.The Commissioners give some indication of the directions in which amendments arerequired, but  this recommends-tion is capable of development in the Department.
