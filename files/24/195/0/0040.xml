BRITISH POLICY ON TEE PREPARATORY COMMISSION                           &quot;IToTT DisIMaByrar.&quot;&apos;                Memorandum &quot;by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.                   The Memorandum circulated on May 1st &quot;by the        Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster asks the Admiralty to        consider whether there are any possible alternatives to the        proposal, submitted in March 19.28 to the Preparatory        Commission.                   The reason for such a change does not arise out of        anything which America has done since the Cooli&amp;ge Conference        or may do in the future.  It rests solely on the ground that        according to Lord Cushendun we must agree to a category of        cruisers which is not of our choosing, or incur the blame for        breaking down not only the Preparatory Commission but &quot;the        whole movement for disarmament by international agreement&apos;7                   In putting forward the two alternatives shown in        columns  4 and 6 of Table &quot;A&quot; annexed, the Admiralty have        submitted variations for discussion.    But it must not be        thought  that they recommend either of these as economical        or advantageous or free from serious risk.   The Admiralty        regard them merely as pis-allers only to be considered in        the event of the Cabinet&apos;s deciding that some agreement must        be reached, even If it involves abandoning the attitude taken        up hy the British Government at the Naval Conference of the        three Powers at Geneva.                                                                \                   The alternative in column 4 has the disadvantage        of allowing destroyers to be of any size instead of being-
 limited  to  1850 tons.   This mi;;ht lead to competition in building destroyers, especially by European Powers, and to the  extravagance which would result from this, as it has from all  building competition where tonnage was unrestricted.         The proposal in column 6 surrenders the position to which the Government adhered so tenaciously during the Naval Conference, viz. that the number of cruisers carrying 8-inch guns should be limited.  There seems to be no more reason to surrender this point stow than there was in August 1927, and by doing so we shall make our attitude at the Naval Conference appear foolish.         It is not quite correct to say as Mr. Cadogan states in his Memorandum of May 1st that the Naval Conference finally broke down on the difference over the 8-inch g&quot;un.  the penultimate proposal at that Conference failed on that accountbut the  last proposal made &quot;by ourselves and the Japanese was rejected by the American delegates on the ground that it gave us too high a total tonnage.         If we surrender on the 8-inch gun now, we shall be confronted by the tonnage difficulty as soon as we enter upon the next stage of the proceedings and discuss  the numbers ofvessels  in each category.         It seems to be plain that the U.SoA.  would not  acceptthe proposal of column 4 on account  of its  probable effect  inlimiting 8-inch guns, and even if we persuaded the French toagree to it, the only advantage would be  to put the blame forbreaking up the Preparatory Committee on to the shoulders ofthe Americans.         It is clear from the  Figures given In the Appendixattached to this Memorandum that the adoption  of  any possible alternatives to our scheme at  the Naval  Conference will  addvery heavily to the cost,  unless we  abandon the numbers  whichare necessary for our security.
                  If, for the sake of satisfying ill-informed public         opinion we adopt the policy of admitting that it is always         our fault if a settlement is not reached and of continuing         to make concessions until agreement is airriyed at, there         is no length to which we may not he pushed.                  If we say that we can agree to any skeleton form         of categories now, and fight it out when the time comes         for fixing th&amp; numbers of ships in each category, we shall         merely he putting off the evil day by somewhat disingenuous         tactics with the practical certainty of breaking down at         the next stage.                   If it does not break down at the next stage we         shall for the sake of coming to airy sort  of agreement         rather than none have made use of a Conference called to         promote limitation of armaments and reduction in expense In         order to produce a result which must mean far more expense         in cruisers or the loss of our security.                   For these reasons it would surely be better policy       ,  to abandon,  at any rate for the time,  the attempt to  draw         up careful and detailed formulae,  which have hitherto         proved impossible  to reconcile with the varying needs of         the different Nations.                    Mr. Kellogg&apos;s invitation to make a Multilateral         Treaty offers the  opportunity  of convincing public  opinion         that we are  as much opposed to war as  any other Nation,         if we give  a. ready and  generous response  to it.                    Is not  this  the  moment  to desist from attempts to         devise mathematical tables,  to avoid the  risk of returning to         the state of friction which  minor  differences  proypke,  and         having made  a public  declaration of the will of all the  great         Nations for  peace  to leave  it  to each Nation to  xaake\such         reductions as  their circumstances  demand  and the*fsr need  for         self-defence  will  admit?

Cost of Building and Maintaining a Cruiser Force      of 60 Vessels under 20 years cf age.          The attached tables A, B, C and D show the approximate costs for cruiser forces composed of different types of vessels in various proportions but all comprising the same total number of 60 cruisers under 20 years of age.          It should be noted that the figures.given under&quot;Annual Maintenance Cost&quot; are for maintaining the whole ina state of full commission under average conditions ofservice.          In peace only a proportion are so maintained, theremainder being in reserve.   As, however, each table dealswith a force differently composed, it is not possible tomake fair comparisons between them except on the basis given          The total cost of maintenance would, therefore,in peace be less than that stated, but the differences between the tables still gives  a very fair relative idea  of comparative costs.          Only  &quot;Direct Expenditure&quot; has been given, the non-effective liability in respect  of  retired pay and pensionsis excluded.
