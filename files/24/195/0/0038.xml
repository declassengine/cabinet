Memorandum by Minister of Labour.           I feel I ought to bring to the notice of my colleagues     the unsatisfactory trend of the unemployment figures in the     past  few weeks.           In the first three months of this year the live register     figures were at about the same level as the corresponding     figures for 1926, and substantially lower than those for 1927,     which, of course, were still affected by the results of the     coal  dispute.          Normally, we expect the figures to go on decreasing     during April as they did in 1927, and to be at their lowest     during May and June.   This year they have, since the beginning     of April, shown a fairly steady increase.   On 21st May the     total was 1,101,026, or 122,850 more than on 23rd May last     year.   On 6th June the total was 1,160,000;  this latter     figure, however, is temporarily inflated by Whitsun stoppages.          A substantial part of the increase in April (perhaps as     much  as 25,000) was due to the operation of the new Unemployment     Insurance Act, whicn removed certain restrictions on benefit.     On the other hand, from the beginning of January onwards the     registers had been reduced by about 25,000 persons over 65 years     of age, owing to the operation of the Pensions Scheme.   While,     therefore, the April increase was steeper by about 35,000 than     it -would otherwise have been, the current figures on balance     are  substantially comparable with those of last year.          As regards the distribution of the increase in unemployment     over  the various industries, comparing 31st May this year with     23rd May last year, none of the principal industries show any                                                        /marked

93ihf 1Z JLMinistry of Labour.16th June,  192J%     The general effect of these figures,  which,  of  course,are largely influenced by the distribution of the coal,  cotton and iron and steel industries,  is that  the districts with a relatively low percentage of unemployment  are little worseor (in the case of London) are  actually better;   while thodistricts with heavy unemployment, and  particularly  wales and the Northern Counties of England, have become definitelyworse,                                   (Intd. )  A.
