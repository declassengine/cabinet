[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^  Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1928.SECEET.                                                     Copy No    28CP. 187 (28).CABINET.AKHWAN SITUATION.         MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.    AT their meeting of the 23rd May the Cabinet  decided that the Air ministry should examine the whole question of posts on the Iraq-Nejd frontier, with a viewto determining which of these posts  were absolutely  essential and which, if any ofthem, could be dispensed with.  The Cabinet at that meeting accepted the view ofthe C.I.D. that the maintenance of certain frontier posts in the western desert was essential for the effective defence of Iraq and  that  it was impossible to give wayto Ibn Saud on the principle involved in this question.  They wished, however, to bein a position, when making this clear to Ibn Saud, to&apos; emphasise how moderate wereour demands in this respect considering  the extent of frontier affected.    I informed the High Commissioner  for Iraq  of the conclusion reached by theCabinet and asked him to  furnish me with his views by telegraph.  I circulate acopy of his reply (Appendix I).  I understand that a telegram making  similarrecommendations  has  been received by the Air Ministry from the Air OfficerCommanding, Iraq.  My colleagues will  see that  the High Commissioner considersthat the essential needs of Iraq could, for the  present, be met by the retention of four posts only, (other than two posts so remote from the frontier as to be clearlyoutside the scope of Ibn Saudis objections). Of these posts one, namely, that at Rutbah,to which, although actually closer to the frontier than the disputed post at Busaiyah,Ibn Saud has hitherto raised no objection, may also be regarded as beyond the range of controversy.  It is a recognised and essential link in our air and road communica-tions  with Iraq.   As  regards  the three remaining  posts, it  seems probable thatIbn Saud will adhere to his objections, in  whatever manner  our  intentions arecommunicated  to  him.   If  so, I am against  making any further  concession tohim in this matter.  The right of the Iraq Government to maintain  these posts isclear  and  incontrovertible,  and  its abandonment  would  be  attended  by  most fortunate results.   Ibn Saud might be temporarily placated, but  the interests ofIraq, no less than  of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  would be seriously prejudiced.  It is common ground,  I believe, that in constructing these posts the Iraq GovernmenthaA^e done nothing contrary either to the terms or the spirit of their treaty engage-ments  to Ibn Saud.  I regard the plea of treaty violation as  little more  than a pretext.  Ibn Saud&apos;s true motives  probably lie deeper.  He may well see in the Iraqposts, and in the increased efficiency  of Iraq frontier administration, a check to hisown dreams of further territorial expansion.  This view of the case is brought outvery clearly in a despatch from Sir TI. Dobbs of the  29th  March, which I circulate for the information of the Cabinet (Appendix  II).  This despatch was writtenbefore it was known that Ibn Saud was prepared  to meet Sir  G.  Clayton or that hewould succeed in  restraining  his  tribes.   It  follows  that  some  of  the high commissioners recommendations go  bej^ond what I could now support or he would himself wish to advocate at the present  time.   But the value of the despatch as ageneral survey of the situation has not been impaired.    My conclusions  are (1) that no  permanent peace on the  frontier would result from surrender to Ibn Saud&apos;s  demands; and (2) that the only hope of security lies inthe maintenance of a chain of fortified posts as proposed by the High commissioner and the Air Officer Commanding.   I  would point out that  these posts serve notonly to protect Iraq from  Akhwan encroachment, but that they are indispensable       [17811]                                                         B
in order to prevent counter-raiding from Iraq and thus to neutralise any possibletendency on the part of King Feisal to connive at such raiding by Iraq tribes as an instrument of his personal hostility towards Ibn  Saud.     There is a further consideration of great  weight.  Apart  from other objections,we could not give way to Ibn Saud on the point of principle without tying our handsin the matter of the proposed trans-desert pipe-line, which will undoubtedly require a number  of small fortified  posts to protect  its  pumping stations.  If we are notfree to  erect such posts in Iraq territory, as  and when required, the whole project for a trans-desert pipe-line and railway with its immense strategic and economicpotentialities for the future may be stultified at the outset.   Ibn Saud is of coursefree to do what be pleases in  his own territory; but he cannot be allowed to establishclaims beyond his own borders which may fatally hamper a great Imperial enterprise.That would be far too heavy  a price to pay for his temporary  appeasement.     In  the circumstances I am  not  prepared  to recommend an)^ concession ofprinciple;  but I  am anxious to take as conciliatory a line as  possible in matters of detail.  I  agree that the number of posts should be reduced  to a  minimum, but Iconsider that  the present recommendations of the High Commissioner representthe furthest that we can safely go in this direction.  It is  indeed very doubtfulwhether even these recommendations will prove acceptable to  the Iraq Government,or that if they did they would be passed through the Iraq Parliament.     On the point of procedure, the question will arise whether  our decision shouldbe communicated to Ibn Saud in writing or  whether the suspended conversations should be resumed.   This is  a matter that can be discussed orally  with Sir GilbertClayton, who has now returned to this country,  and  is  preparing a report on his mission to Jeddah.   I shall hope to raise the  point again at a later stage.                                                                    L.  S.  A.    Colonial Office, Downing Street,            June 15, 1928.&apos;  .APPENDIX I.       Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the                      Secretary of State for the Colonies.                             Dated 28th May, 1928.              (received Colonial Office 1-58 P.M. 28th May,  1928.)    No.  300.    Reference your telegram No. 232 of 25th May, Air Officer  Com-manding is away on distant tour, but I have  been in consultation with him by telegram.  We think that for general defence and administrative purposes Iraq couldmanage with Rutba, Shabicha, Selman and Busaiya, all of which except Shabichaalready exist.    The above does not take into consideration the existing (? post) atMuhaiwir  and proposed post at Ainwiza, which are so near the Euphrates edge ofthe desert that it is improbable that they would fall within the scope of the objectionsmade by  Ibn Saud.    With  regard  to Shabicha, we are of the opinion that post there is essential,partly because of  the landing ground and the excellence of the water supply, andpartly because it is the principal grazing centre of Dahamshah  tribe, whose defectionto Ibn Saud would so weaken Anazeh as to cause the whole desert to be exposed toIkhwan propaganda. According to most recent surveys, Shabicha is 33 miles fromthe frontier.    We  must also consider, in addition to general defence,  particular  defence of trans-desert railway and pipeline to Haifa.  In  this connection, please see report by major Holt of February 1922.  I understand that alignment suggested in that report is confirmed by later enquiries.   It  is almost certain that it will be necessary toconstruct defensive enclosures and to post police at all stations on the railway and&quot; Boosting Stations &quot; on the pipeline.  I understand that the latter have to be built at intervals of about 1 to every 50 miles. It is impossible to tell where these stations would be situated, but alignment west of Rutba gradually approaches Nejd frontier,and,  within Trans-Jordan  Corridor, runs within 20 miles of it.  The best coursewould probably be to make an  arrangement with  Ibn Saud that  such defensive
enclosures should not be regarded as forts.  In any case,  it seems important to open the question with him now to prevent  subsequent charges of breach of faith.    I must observe, on the general question, that consent of Iraq  Government toabstention from building forts within 25 miles of the frontier,  or, alternatively, frombuilding forts on specified wells near the  frontier,  was based on the necessity of arriving at some agreed interpretation of Article 3 of Uqair protocol.  The suggestionnow advanced, however, virtually amounts to a new condition which cannot be held to be  treaty obligation, and which Iraq Government have never hitherto contem-plated, viz., that their right to construct forts over the whole of the  desert area  notin the vicinity of the frontier is limited and  subject  to consideration of Ibn Saud&apos;swishes.  I  anticipate  that there would be serious difficulty in obtaining consent ofIraq Government to any such new arrangement.APPENDIX II.(Secret.)Sir,                                                 Baghdad, March 29, 1928.    I HAVE the honour to forward two important and interesting memorandaf thefirst, dated the 17th March, 1928, from Captain Glubb, Administrative Inspector on special duty with the desert tribes of Iraq,* and the second, dated the 22nd. March,1928, from Mr. Cornwallis, Adviser to  the  Ministry of the Interior,  both being on.the subject of the situation in Najd. t    2.  Where even the Arabs are in doubt, I can but add my conjectures to the rest.No one has ever supposed that Ibn Sa&apos;ud moves  from any other motive than anenlightened self-interest, nor has anyone denied his great ambition.  We are chiefly concerned to discover,  first, how far his tribes in raiding Iraq have acted with hisconnivance or at his instigation; secondly, if they have so acted, how he can be madeto restrain them ; or, thirdly, if they are out of his control, whether it is probable thathis control will be restored by any measures which we can take and will then be usedto prevent further raiding.    3.  In examining  the  question of Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s connivance,  the main point fordiscussion is whether the Akhwan  Bedouin tribes have the power to rebel against him for any long time.   This appears to me doubtful,  in spite of Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s recentstatements that his tribes are out of his control.   All travellers in Central Arabiaagree that the Bedouin cannot live without constant resort to the cities for supplies,and Ibn Sa&apos;ud, though he has no large standing army, yet has a strong enough forcerecruited from the cities and from the settled inhabitants of the oases to deny supplies to the Bedouin. They  must, therefore, in the end do his bidding, and it is unlikelythat they can have really defied him. If this reasoning is correct, one  must ask why he should allow them to raid Iraq. I believe his reasons to be his hatred and suspicion of King Faisal, his desire to absorb  the  Iraq  Trans-Jordanian  corridor  to theMediterranean, and his determination that his influence shall be paramount, at  leastover the whole desert up to the borders of the Euphrates.    4.  I need not dwell upon Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s attitude towards King Faisal and theHashimite House.  His  statement  recorded on page  40 of Sir Gilbert  Clayton&apos;sReport  on the  Bahra  and  Hadda Agreements sufficiently  reveals this;  &apos;&apos; He hadFaisal on one side and Abdullah on  the other, both new creations, fencing him in on either side and both hostile towards him.  When  he  thought of the injustices to himself, he was surprised at the moderation of his demands.&quot;  King Faisal and the amir Abdullah, of course, reciprocate his feelings.    5.  Touching  the  corridor between Iraq and  Trans-Jordania,  the  record ofrecent discussions is equally  instructive.   In my telegram No.  39, dated  the15th January, 1924,  I reported that Ibn Sa&apos;ud had told Dr. Holmes that  his desirewas to make the territories of Najd and Syria meet, so as to cut off Iraq from theMediterranean  and impose his own terms upon anyone wishing to build a  pipe-lineor railway across the desert.  This desire became more apparent during Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;discussions in the  autumn of  1925 with Sir Gilbert Clayton, who on page 5 of his report states : &quot; He also objected vehemently to the northern frontier being so drawnas to unite Trans-Jordan and Iraq and thus separate Najd from Syria.  ;  . . .   he maintained that the territories of which he was  now master had always  marched        * No. G./1710.[17811]t No. G./S.A. 174.                   B 2
with those of Syria, and that, in view of this historical fact and of the long-establishedtraffic between Damascus and Central Arabia, he could not see his way to accepting.any kind of barrier between his dominions and the Syrian border.&quot;  Ibn Sa&apos;ud hadto yield  at  the time, but it  is natural that his  ambitions  should persist, and  the discovery of a great oilfield in Iraq, bringing with it the prospect of the early con-&apos;struction of a pipe-line and railway, has almost certainly inflamed thenr afresh.    6.   Of  Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s desire for paramountcy over the whole desert there  can beno  doubt.   The conversations which preceded the Treaty of Muhammerah and  theUqair Protocole furnished proof of it (vide telegram from Sir  Percy Cox, No. 214,dated the 16th March,  1922, and Confidential despatch,, dated the 3rd June, 1922),and his  theory is baldly stated in his letter to His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Consul atJiddah,  dated the 7th February, 1928, as follows :-          &quot; After  Faisal&apos;s  arrival  in  Iraq  the  treaty of  El Muhammerah was    forwarded to us  and we refused it, believing  that the  Iraq people  had  no    frontiers behind Esh  Shatt  (the  Euphrates);  but that all the Arabs  behind    Esh Shatt, the  Dhafir  and Anaizah, &amp;c, have always been in submission to the    Governor of Najd.  The people of Iraq used to  pay Khawa  (tribute) to Najd    for  crossing such frontiers both in the days of our forefathers,, of Ibn Rashid    and  in  our  days. .... &amp; Alt hough  unsatisfied,  we  accepted the frontiers    -on condition that drinking from the water should be free and that building over    the  wells and neighbouring places should be prohibited.&quot;    Further, a report, dated the 13th March, 1928, by Major R. H. L. Fink, of  theIraq  Army, stationed at Samawah  on  the  Euphrates,  contains the  following passage:           &quot; A man of the Shammar,  recently arrived from Najd territory, had heard    that about a fortnight ago Ibn Sa&apos;ud had issued orders to Shaikhs in northern    Najd territory  to collect  all available men for a raid against Iraq. .... Ibn    Sa&apos;ud is stated to  have  said in his orders that the boundary of Iraq was  the    railway and the Euphrates and that all territory south and westward of that    was Najd territory.  Posts erected in this zone constituted a direct infringement    of the authority  of ,the Akhwan.  It was necessary to  attack Iraq as early as    possible before  fortified posts, which it would be extremely difficult to capture,    could be established, and that  tribes  camping in  the area must  pay taxes to    Najd; otherwise they would be  treated as unbelievers and exterminated.&quot;    Although the tale of the actual proclamation  of a jihad by Ibn Sa&apos;ud isdiscredited,  this  rumour of  his renewed  claim to  the  whole area west  of  the&apos;&apos;Euphrates, coinciding as it does with the restatement of that claim in his letter ofthe 7th February, is significant.  In truth, constant religious propaganda, expansion and penetration form the very foundations of Ibn Sa&apos;ud&apos;s power,  and there havebeen signs that he had hoped gradually to convert to the Akhwan faith ail the Iraqdesert tribes, the Dhafir, the Shawiyah (or mixed shepherd tribes) and the Anaizah,and later, after he  had extended his religious sway  to the fringes of the desert, to await a time when  British interest in Iraq should slacken and then make a  springupon  the Euphrates and the Shi&apos;ah sacred cities.   Hinc illos lacrimce, and hencehis fury at the construction of police posts in the desert designed to serve as centres for the collection of information, for the consolidation of  Iraq influence over  the tribes  and  for an  effective  display of  administration.  It is, if  persisted in,  acomplete checkmate to his  plans, and if His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government wereto approve the suggestions  made in  some quarters that the posts already constructed&apos;should be destroyed and that no more should be built, Ibn Sa&apos;ud would have  gainedhis end.  On this view I cannot now doubt that Ibn Sa&apos;ud did at least connive inthe attack  on the Busaiyah  Post,  and I believe that Captain Glubb&apos;s theory of&quot; unauthorised raids &quot; is substantiated.    7.   We have next  to enquire how best to induce or force  Ibn Sa&apos;ud to  changehis present  policy,  restrain his tribesmen from raiding and refrain from temptingIraq tribesmen into his camp. It is  plain that concessions to his ambitions&apos;, promisesnot to build posts at places other than those in close proximity to the frontier, or notto send British or Iraq officials or aeroplanes or armoured cars  into the desert would merely  promote  his plans  and deprive Iraq  of all  chance of counteracting them.They might buy a  short quiescence, but that is all.   Mr.  Cornwallis and CaptainGlubb (in his report and in  a later telegram) advocate the destruction of certain                                 * Italics are mine.
 wells in Najd territory which supply advancing raiders and the bombing of Jarya and Artawiyah, two permanent centres of the Mutair tribe, which has hitherto been the most active of the Akhwan tribes  against Iraq.  I had myself, in my telegram No.  93, dated the 17th February, 1928, suggested that warnings should be dropped on Artawiyah for the purpose of frightening the Mutair tribe;  but in your telegram No.  82, dated the 22nd February, 1928, you objected to this proposal and directed that a message should be sent to Ibn Sa&apos;ud (which was finally despatched on the 25th February) informing him that on receipt of his assurance that he was taking effective measures to prevent further raids on Kuwait and Iraq territories and to punish Faisal ibn  Dawish  and  to obtain  reparation, His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to suspend all air action in Naj d otherwise than in hot pursuit of raiding-parties.  This message must have reached Ibn Sa&apos;ud about the 3rd  March, and his letter, dated the 8th March, which has been summarised in the telegram from the Eesident, Bushire,  No,  47/T, dated the 17th March, was his reply.  In that letter Ibn Sa&apos;ud gives no assurance such as is requested, and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government  are consequently at liberty to  continue the  flights of  aeroplanes over Najd territory (which are, in fact, being continued), and to pursue the  former policy of punishing the Mutair in Najd territory for the atrocities in Iraq which they have already committed.   I still think that this should be done (although I  do not advise the destruction of wells), and I do not believe that it would prejudice Sir  Gilbert Clayton&apos;s mission, since Ibn Sa&apos;ud now himself pretends  that the Mutair are quite out of his control, and it is evident that they must be controlled and punished by someone, if they are not shortly to revive and raid again at a season more inconvenient for our defence forces.  I should be grateful if  you would acquaint me by telegram with your views upon this point.     8.  But, as the Resident in the Persian Gulf has  always maintained, the main problem is that of Ibn Sa&apos;ud himself.   I see no prospect of his abating  his ambitions and  no profit in trying to buy him off.   Nor is there any reason why there should be any  simple solution to our difficulties.   The price of security is constant vigilance, and, just as we have countered in India the desire of the Amir of Afghanistan to penetrate and win over the Pathan tribes by the occupation of Waziristan and by a firm attitude towards him,  so must we counter the similar desire on the part of Ibn Sa&apos;ud by the effective occupation of the desert and by a similarly firm attitude. I attach a sketch of a Desert Defence Organisation drawn up by Air Vice-Marshal Sir Edward Ellington, which is now before the Iraq Government.   The principal feature of this scheme, which I endorse, is the maintenance of eight posts, stretching right across the &quot;Iraq Trans-Jordan  corridor&quot; from the Kuwait to the  Syrian boundary.  The maintenance and occupation of  these posts would hearten the Iraq tribes, minimize the danger of raids and prevent  the spread of Akhwan propaganda. Ibn  Sa&apos;ud  would  certainly dislike  it  intensely, quite as  much as the Amir  of Afghanistan disliked the occupation of Waziristan  (a  dislike which prolonged mynegotiations in Kabul in 1921 for the space of eleven months); but we need not yield to his dislike, and, if he threatens us with the hostility either of his tribes or himself, we have in our hands, as I have often represented,  the  far more effective threat of a blockade of his ports.  That this would be effective I am convinced by my experience as Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Autumn of 1919.  It will be remembered that the Government of  India were at that time restricting the export of foodstuffs owing to  famine conditions  in India,  and  I received,  through the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the most violent protests from Ibn Sa&apos;ud against such restrictions, and messages imploring that they  should be relaxed, on the grounds (endorsed by all British authorities acquainted with the facts) that his people could not exist for more than a month or two without  supplies from India.    9.  My conclusions are  that Ibn  Sa&apos;ud  probably connived at the attack by Dawish on the Busaiyah post, and that  Captain Glubb&apos;s theory about &quot;unauthorised raids&quot; is probably  correct.   I  recommend that, as an  ad interim  deterrent to the Mutair, aeroplanes  should drop warnings on Artawiyah, and  should subsequently bomb Artawiyah, if there are signs of  a revival of Mutair raids;  that Sir Edward Ellington&apos;s plan of  desert posts should be adopted,  and Ibn Sa&apos;ud  informed of our intention to carry it out, and that, if he cannot be brought to acquiesce in our policy for securing to Iraq the control of her desert  tribes,  he should be warned that we maybe compelled to have recourse to  a maritime blockade.  It would, of course,  be wise to make all possible  minor concessions (such as an undertaking not to construct posts over specified wells within a reasonable distance of the  frontier) for the purpose -of saving his face.
    10.  I am sending copies of this  despatch  to  the  Government of India,  thePolitical Resident in the Persian  Gulf,  the  High  Commissioners  for Egypt&apos; and palestine and His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Consul at Jiddah.                                                   I have, &amp;c.                                           (Signed)       H.  DOBBS,                                                 High Commissioner for Iraq.The Right Hon&apos;ble L. C. M. S. Amery, P.C.,  M.P.,        Secretary of State for the Colonies,              Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.                                   Enclosure.                          Desert Defence Organisation.     THE object of this scheme is to provide an organisation which can      (a.)  Assist  in the defence against Akhwan of the tribes when grazing in the-           desert.     (b.)  Control the tribes by moving from exposed areas when Iraq is threatened           with raids by Akhwan.     (c.)  Obtain intelligence and information of  the approach of raiders.     (d.)  Police  duties.     2.   The area  of the defence should include all the  desert area of the Dulaim,south of the Euphrates, Kerbala,  Diwaniyah,  Nasiriyah and  Basrah Liwas andshould be formed into a separate province.     3.  A  line  of posts should be constructed  behind which the  tribes  should  be withdrawn  when  a  raid  is imminent.  This line should  be Jarishan,  Busaiyah,Salman,  Shabicha, Lussuf,  Ain  Wiza, Muhaiwar, Rutbah.  Approximately eightposts will be required, and a landing ground in the vicinity of the post is essential.     4.  Each post should be capable of its own  defence,  and should include a W/Tset and operators.  It would serve the following uses:       (a.)  A  centre  for collecting  and transmission  of information.     (5.)  Storage of petrol.     (c.)  Protection of the crews of aircraft during the night.     (d.)  A home for the desert camel and car patrols.     (e.)  Deny the  wells at which the posts are situated to raiders and thus restrict           their watering facilities.     5.  The garrison should consist of            (a.)  Twentv  camel  men.           (&amp;.)  Twenty  footmen.           (c.)  Two light-armed cars.           (d.)  Two W/T operators.     6.  A reserve  of mounted  men should be formed and be  divided into two bodies,located at Shaibah and Ur.  Approximate strength should be 408 cars at each place.The  garrisons of the posts should be relieved periodically from, the reserve.     7.  The forces should  be  recruited from men accustomed to the desert.   Theyshould all be able to ride  camels, and should bring  with them their own camels.I should like to see  this raised on  the silladar  system,  except, of course, the carcrews and W/T operators.     8.  The tribal Sheikhs, such as Mahrut and  Ajil, should  be required, as acondition of their allowances, to produce, when required,  a  minimum number  oftribal levies to supplement the  camel corps in repelling a raid.     9.  The employment of these forces would be as follows : The posts would send out camel men daily to visit the tribes grazing within the area of  the post, and wouldpost videttes which should remain out at night in periods of alarm.   The cars would assist in  the work  of the camel men and push the reconnaissances as far as possibleduring daylight.  When information was received that a raid was likely, the reservescould be  moved to  such places as seemed most suitable for meeting the raiders.  the armoured cars of the Royal Air Force and later of the Iraq Army will be available  aswell, and if the area of the raid cannot be foreseen, the reserves will be moved to that part of the desert least favourable  for the employment of cars and the cars to the-parts where they can best be manoeuvred.  The Tribal Levy will be called out.
