W. 1.                              24th May, 1928.My dear Prime Minister.        I have to report to you the further developments which have taken place in regard to political broad-casting.        As you will remember, the British broadcasting corporation originally, on their own initiative, put up certain proposals , one of which was that after aninaugural period of throe weeks during which eaoh ofthe political parties should,hays equal opportunities,the Government should be given time for time with theother two parties, except during the period of aGeneral Election.  The Labour Party accepted these                        -1-This Document is the Property of His BritannicMajesty&quot;s G-overnment.
proposals in principle;  the Conservative Party agreedto thorn unreservedly? but the Liberal Party raisedobjections.   In consequence of the S3 objections theBritish Broadcasting Corporation summoned a conference which the Chief&apos; whip and I attended on behalf of theConservative Party.  At that conference the Liberalsmaintained their objections, and Sir Herbert Samuelsuggested that arrangements might be made for 17political speeches at fortnightly intervals (after theinaugural 3 speeches) 7 of which would be allocated tothe Government, 5 to the Labour Party and 5 to the liberals.  Somewhat naturally the Labour Party,influenced by the Liberal demands, were induced tomodify their previous attitude and give their support to this proposal.  Acting upon the instructions of theCabinet the Chief Whip and I refused to give way, withthe result that no agreement was reached and theBritish Broadcasting Corporation announced that theywould communicate their proposals in due course.        I have now received a letter- from Sir JohnReith, in which he asks whether I would accept aproposal that between now and the end of the year(apart from the 3 inaugural speeches) there should be Government occasions aid. 2 each for the other two parties, and that the situation should be reviewedearly in January without prejudice to anything v*hiehmay have happened this year.        That is the question with which we are facedat the moment.   The Chief Whip arid I are absolutelyagreed in thinking that this proposal ought to be resisted.  I will first of all set out the grounds which can be stated publicly, in the House or on the platform.
     Cl) The proposals originally submitted repre- sented the unbiassed views of the British Broadcast- ing  Corporation, which is an independent body. They met  with the acceptance of the two parties forming an overwhelming proportion of the House of Commons., and  the fact that - objections are raised by -the smallest party in  the House of Commons, numbering some 40 members, is not sufficient justification for  upsetting  an arrangement which has been accepted by the vast majority.  The very fact that the  proposals  emanated from an -unbiassed authority and  were subsequently endorsed by an  enormous majority representing the Government  of the day and  the official Opposition is ample  proof that they formed an equitable basis for the system of controversial  broadcasting.  In this  argument I am ignoring the fact  that, the Labour Party was subse- quently induced to support an arrangement which was more advantageous  to them because it  is the uninfluenced decisions of the various parties which ought to be weighed in the balance.     (2) On the merits of the proposal it must be recognised that the Government of the day is in a special position as compared with the ether two parties.  It bears the responsibility of government. Its  function is action, whereas - the function of the Opposition parties is criticism.   It is obviously right and proper that the Government of the  day,which owing to  its position is  especially a butt for  Criticism,  should have equal  opportunities withthe  other two parties for answering such  criticism,more especially as any misrepresentations  of Govern-ment action or Government  policy ray have  a  haimfuleffect from the national point  of view.
         There are further  considerations by which the  Chief Whip and I are  influenced, but -which couldnot be published abroad.         (l)  If we maintain our  previous attitude it     would be extremely difficult  for the British     Broadcasting Corporation to go back upon their     original proposals , which represented their     unbiassed -judgment of  what  was fair and reasonable.         (2)  On the other hand,  if the British Broad-     casting  Corporation adhere  to their&quot; original     proposals,  the Liberal Party  might try  to make a     fuss  in  Parliament, but it  would be extremely     difficult for them to  achieve success in their     attempt, because the labour Party would be faced     with  the fact that they had agreed in principle to .     the original suggestions.,         (3)  Lastly, supposing that the British Broad-     casting  Corporation did attempt to go back upon     their original proposals, and owing to  the     failure  to  reach any agreement the whole idea of     broadcasting controversial  political matter had     to be abandoned, this  fact  would certainly not     be detrimental to  the  Conservative Party.  The     Labour Party has a powerful organisation in this     country, but no Press.  Trie Liberal Party is well     equipped with funds, has a  fairly powerful     Press, but  a poor  organisation in the country.     The  C onservativ3 Party, on  the other&quot; hand, has     the best and strongest organisation of  the three     parties, and is supported by  a very large section     of the Press.   In  such circumstances it is clear     that  it  is all to  the  advantage of the  other two
1 %lX z)i s    par-ties to have a system of political broadcasting,-    as it provides thera mth better oppbrtunltles of    propaganda, than they enjoy at present.  Some    advantage would accrue to them even if the    original proposals of the British &quot;Broadcasting    Corporation were adopted, but that advantage would    be enormously increased if the proposals were    modified in the direction suggested by the Liberal    Part;/.  I am quite confident that if a failure    to reach agreement resulted in an abandonment of    the whole idea, there would be little regret    entertained by Conservative Members.        For these reasons the Chief Whip and I would urge very strongly that we should -be given authorityby the Cabinet to adhere to the previous decision.        I attach a draft of the reply which might besent in answer to the enquiry from the British Broad-cast ing Corporati on..

June? 1923.JDear Sir John,        I have received your letter in which you ask whether i should, be prepared to accept a proposal that between now and the end of the year (apart from thethree inaugural speeches) the Government shall beallowed three occasions for the broadcasting ofpolitical statements? while the other parties should beallowed two each during that period.  I have given theproposal most careful consideration? but I regret thatI can see no justification for departing from, theoriginal proposals which were put up by the british broadcasting Corporation on their own initiative.        May I be allowed to summarise the facts verybriefly?        The British Broadcasting Corporation,&apos; anindependent and unbiassed authority, submitted in thefirst instance proposals which in their judgment werefair and reasonable and gave due recognition to therespective positions and responsibilities of the threepolitical par-ties.  The Conservatives accepted those proposals unreservedly? while the Labour Party agreedto them In principle.  Objections were, however, raisedby the Liberal Party, which, It must be remembered,represents a fractional proportion of the House ofCommons,,  In consequence of these objections yousummoned a conference at which the Labour Party?influenced no doubt by Liberal arguments, somewhatmodified their previous attitude, but the fact romains
 that the proposals which, you  considered  fair- and reasonable were accepted in the  first  instance both &quot;by the Part;/- which represents the Government of the day and by the official Opposition,  The fact that the proposals emanated in the first instance from an independent and impartial body and  were subs e- queritly endorsed by  such an enormous majority of those who were to be affected by them  is I think sufficient proof that they formed an equitable basis for -the system of controversial broadcasting.        I am not sure that it is not superfluous on mypart to attempt to justify proposals which emanated in the first place from the British Broadcasting -Corpora-tic-n, but on the merits of the proposals I would observe that the Government of the day is in a special position as compared with the other two political parties.   It has to bear ail the responsibility in regard to the government of the country  The other parties have no such responsibility.  The function ofthe opposition parties is criticism:  the function ofthe Government is action.   It is this very fact, combined with the element of responsibility, which renders the Government particularly liable to criticism in respect of its policy and its actions.Moreover, the actions or the policy of the GovernmentWhich may be criticised by the opposition -parties are matters of immediate public concern, and it is to thenational interest that any misunderstandings oriris Informed criticisms should be answered as soon aspossible.  These considerations cannot apply in likedegree to the opposition parties, and it is for these reasons that I feel that the Government of the  day
         must be allowed equal opportunities  with each of the         other two parties,  just as they have full scope  for         replying to criticisms in the  House  of Commons.                 There  is one  small point which I should  lime to         add.   In my opinion it is highly desirable that  we         should, if possible,  come to  some definite arrangement         at the outset  which can provide a permanent basis.         The point at issue  is one which must be settled  sooner         or later, and  in my view it would be a mistake to         shirk this issue by entering  into provisional arrange-         ments which would only operate for a period of a few         months.                               Your s sinc e re ly,Sir John Reith,    British Er o adcast ing C o re or ati on,         Savoy Hill, W.0.2.2, Whitehall Gardens,      May 31,  192S.S. W.1,
