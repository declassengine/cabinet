MEMORANDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.     I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, theaccompanying minutes of the last meeting of the Board OfTrade Advisory Council held on the 6th June.     I dealt with the trade position fully in my speech onthe Board of Trade Vote in the House of Commons on the12th June.     The first quarter of the year began vary well; butthere is no doubt that there has been a definite and generalset-back in the last two months.  It is not easy to find thecause or to forecast the future.  The set-back is not due toany sudden or serious increase in retained imports.  In the textile trades, no doubt, some orders have been held up bythe threat of trade disputes; but the slackening- in ordersis much more wide-spread; and the low freights ruling in shipping generally would seem to indicate that there is ageneral sag  in world trade.     There is no falling off in the retained imports of raw-materials; but I hesitate to build too much on this, as theMay imports may represent orders placed before the sag  in trade became apparent *     The Board of Trade have now completed a collection ofdata sufficient to give a production index covering two-thirds of industry.  I hope that we shall soon get enough material to make the index complete.  The following table gives theindex figure for 1924, 1927 and the first quarter of 1928:-

ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR, referring to the recent meeting ofthe Economic Consultative Committee at Geneva, said thatthere was a general consensus of opinion at the Committeethat the coal stoppage in this country had had a very far-reaching effect in every other country and had caused a big set-back to the trade of Europe, from ^foich it wasonly now just recovering.   The Committeels Reportreferred to an increased production throughout Europe, butthat was largely due to the investment of money from america, and also to some extent to savings, particularlyin Germany.  In 1927 Europe produced half the world1s steeloutput for the first time since 1914, with the exception of1921, which was an unusual year.  A great deal was said atthe meeting about the Franco-German Treaty and the benefitsderived from it by other countries under their most-favoured-nation rights.  The French had got a good deal Inthe Report about it, but Its effect had been mitigated bythe British delegates pointing out that France had had anopportunity to raise their tariff again on particulararticles.  There v;as some discussion, not so much publiclyas privately, on the frequent rise and fall of trade,which, was not only taking place in England, but in Germanyand other places, and the conclusion was come to thatthere was such a large latent productive capacity in allcountries that we were likely to have this phenomenon formany years.     There was still an attempt going on by France and a group of other countries to start a Department of theInternational Labour Office at Geneva to deal with economic questions, but the British delegates thought that theEconomic Committee could quite well do the work, and thatto set up another organisation would be an unnecessaryexpense and a mistake.  On the question of a &quot;TariffHoliday&quot;, they pointed out that while this might be a goodthing, tariffs at present were much too high, and somethingshould be done to get them down.  On the whole they were well supported on that.  Sir Arthur had proposed that theiron and steel manufacturers at Geneva might meet and discuss the tariff situation amongst themselves.  It was generally agreed that it would be useful, but there was agood deal of feeling that consumers ought to be present as well at such a discussion and it was, therefore, leftt^ the Economic Committee to work out, As regards the subjects on which the proposed tariff conferencesshould take place, the British delegates suggestedvarious commodities, aid finally it was left to trieEconomic Committee to choose them6    Probably iron andsteel and wool would be selected.   Then the EconomicCommittee were pressed to continue their compilationof  Indices of tariff levels, to make public what each country was doing.   The subject of rationalisationhad not got very far.   The International Management
? ft 3hi \HECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE COMMITTEE (CONED.)Institute had had it handed over to them, and they would report in a year&apos;s tima*--&apos;      As  regards industrial  agreements  there was  a  strongmove  that  information should be  collected at  Geneva both as  regards their  character,  the  laws under which they  were permitted,  and  so on.  There was a request by Mr.Jouhauxthat  national agreements  as  well as international  onesshould be  investigated, but  it wag pointed out by  hisFrench colleagues that there were 3..,200  such  agreements inGermany  alone,&apos;  so it was decided to deal with international agreements  only.   In the matter of industrialstatistics it had been agreed to co-operate with theInternational chamber of  Commerce. Rather unfortunately,Belgium  raised  the subjects  of  coal and  sugar specifically,and coal,  of course,  involved the reparations question.As  regards sugar,  the British delegates  made  It  clearthat  developments of  British policy would make it  verydifficult  to go back  to the  Convention of 1902.  little progress was made with Agriculture and there  were  some difficulties owing to lack  of liaison  between theInternational Institute of  Agriculture at Rome and theLeague of  Nations, Mr. Layton had made  a good speech  onthe purchasing  power  of gold and currency fluctuations,and there  was  a general feeling  that the Central Bankswere  doing what they  could  and  that it was best  to leavethe matter alone6      On  the whole Sir A.  Balfour thought they had  had  very useful contact  with delegates from the other  countries and certainly in  one  instance with the Italian ShippingAssociation.    The* Italians  had  been starting anewregulation that all shipping brokers and agents  In Italymust  be  Italians, and  no consignment to a ship was  to bemade  except through an Italian Agent,  and they wereassuming a very difficult attitude.   He took the  matter up  with  their delegate, and  pointed out  that  it  could  not possibly go on, or they were bound to  get retaliation.He  now understood that the  proposal had  been  droppedaltogether.  *hat was wanted now as to  the work of the consultative Committee was  publicity.  Unless it could begot into people&apos;s minds in  every country that there&apos;was apossibility of  reducing tariffs  and that they were now too high, nothing would be done.  The next meeting of  the consultative Committee would be  In a year!s time,  aid  theEconomic CoEimlttee had a  full programme  before it  for  sometime.      hR. PUGH emphasised  what Sir Arthur Balfoxir had saidas  to the  necessity for getting  public opinion aroused onthe questions of  International  trade and commerce.  Agreat effort was  made at  the World Economic Conferencelast  year  to get  countries  to come to  a  unanimousconclusion with regard to the principles to governinternational trade and commerce, but  the public of thedifferent  countries seemed  to know very  little about it.
It was no good e -rpecting trio Governments to do everything.Those who were associated with the industries and servicesof the different countries ought themselves to be consider-ing the different problems.   Generally, he thought the consultative Committee had kept alive the work that hadbeen done by the Economic Conference,  As Sir Arthur had stated, the Economic Committee was still faced with a. gooddeal of work, with which no doubt, progress would be made during the present year, but it was of the utmost importance to awaken public opinion and the interest ofthose who were associated with our Industrial services tothe recommendations of the Consultative Economic Committee,and he thought that that was the unanimous impression ofthose associated with the work of the Committee,     THE PRESIDENT observed that to his mind the most striking thing in the report of the Committee was therecommendation as to the international consideration of tariff problems by individual industries.   All thediscussions on the general question went to show that little progress would be made until these conferences bytrades had taken place.COAL.     :.R. WARHAIa regretted that he could not give a hopefulreport on coalB  The weekly output of coal in the UnitedKingdom for the three weeks ended May 19th had been in eachcase under the 5 million ton per week mark, being only90.3^ of the March, 1925, weekly average basis.  Thequantity of coal exported in April was 3,722,023 tons, ascompared with 4,110,663 tons in March, and the averagevalue per ton was Id, less than in March,  being 15/9 asagainst 15/10.  The exports of coal to certain destinationsIn April, 1928, as compared with the monthly average in1913 were:- 1913, Norway, Sweden and Denmark,  825,000;Germany, 746,000; France, 1,065,000; Italy, 804,000;Spain, 211,000:  In April, 1928, the experts were   Norway,Sweden and Denmark, 290,000; Germany, 431,000;France, 664,000; Italy, 479,000; Spain,  142,000.  the exports to the Baltic Provinces for the  four months endedApril 30th, 1928, as compared with the four months endedApril 30th, 1927, were;-                               1927.              1928,     Finland................  88,130             29,487     Esthnnia...............  14,466             10,555     Latvia.................  21,458              2,090     Lithuania.............,  17,532              4,857ECONOMIC CONSULTATIVE COEKITTBE (CONTD.)
IJ \j UCOAL (COKTD. )     The  decrease  In exports  to  the  Baltic  Provinces  and Scandinavia was, of  course, due  to Polish State-aided competition; the decrease to  Germany was  due to her licensing system;  Italy, to  reparation coal; Prance, to reparation coal and  increased home production and preferential railway rates;  Spain,  to Government restrictions.  Although this country was now in a good position to  put up real economic competition, these import restrictions, including similar ones in Poland and Turkey, were  seriously hampering the British coal export trade  in Europe.   The export  of coal from Poland during April showed  a alight  fall as compared with March, toeing 942,000 tons (provisional) for April,  compared  with 1,008,000 tons for March,     More orders for British  coal were  toeing placed in Hamburg, tout taking the total for last year,  it  was  less than  half what it was the year before,     THE  PRESIDENT observed that he  had taken an opportunity of seeing the new  President of the Italian  Chamber here, and discussing the question of  exports of British coal with him. Sir Philip had said  that while we did not seek special favours from Italy and  were ready to meet competition on equal terms, it would toe regarded as a  rather unfortunate step on their part if obey were proposing to take reparation coal rather than to  take our&apos;s.  He  saw that there had been a greater tendency in Italy lately to take  British coal; and the Germans were not sending  them the full  quota of reparation coal.     MR. WARHAM agreed  that this was so,  but at the same time the Italians pointed out continuously that  the question of an increased use of reparation coal was a  political one.  They said they would have  to be  largely guided by their own Government In the matter, and while  they  would prefer to buy British coal, they stated candidly that pressure from our own Government would be  the most  effective  thing.  In 1913 we had exported  to Italy  9,397,000 tons out of a total Italian import of 10,834,000 tons.  Last year we  exported 6,418,000 tons out  of a total  import of 14,059,000  tons, and if the&quot;present Italian policy  in connection with reparations was carried out, this  6 million tons would  probably be very much reduced in future.   There was a certain amount of enquiry from Canada for British coal, and,  apparently, not an inconsiderable amount of  business was  being  done and the possibility of further trade seemed to be encouraging.  The  total exports from the United Kingdom for the  first  four months  of 1913, 1926, 1927 and 1928  were rather  interesting.  In that period in 1913 we exported  23^ million tons;  in 1926,  17-1 million tons;  in 1927 174j and  in 1928,  15f,     The  various marketing  schemes did not  seem to be working fully yet, but it would appear that  the Midland scheme might prevent either the Welsh or the Scotch  schemes from being successful.  Northumberland and Durham, In the meantime,  were finding business slow to mature and  felt  their trade was gradually leaving them  and going to  the Bumtoer.   On the other hand, it  was believed that the German syndicate  was discouraged
                       COAL (CONTD. )by its losses upon its export trade and was likely to curtailits export quantity to the extent, It had been said,  of15 million tons per annum.  That would have a considerable effect on our business.  Speaking generally, it might be saidthat home demand is fair, but export trade slow and uncertain,and prices low.  The general financial position was bad.     MR. MITCHELL stated that the coal trade in Scotland was still very depressed and heavy losses were being made.  It was too early yet to say much about the output regulation scheme.Additional collieries had been closed during the past month and output had been reduced at others.  The output of the collieries remaining In operation had., however, increased,owing partly to more regular work being obtained.  The totalnumber of men employed had been reduced, and the total outputreduced also, in Scotland;  but.there had been very littlereduction In coal shipments.  Indeed, for the last two weeks the quantities shipped showed an increase over the figures at the beginning of the year.&apos; The home trade had been very unsatisfactory, due partly to the falling off in demand atthis time of the year for house coal, gas coal, etc. andpartly due to increased idle time in the steel works.  stocks at the collieries were practically the same as in March.     LORD GAINFORD remarked that the supply of coke for blastfurnaces in the Cleveland district and the West Coast was inexcess of the demand, and buyers stated they had been ableto arrange supplies at lower prices.  The shipment position had improved during the last few weeks.  The price for forwarddelivery from July/August to the end of the year was 6d.to ls,Od. per ton more than could be obtained for promptdelivery.  The demand for foundry coke had been quiet,probably on account of the Whitsuntide holidays.  He saw no improvement in the coal trade in the North East Coastdistrict.                        IRON AND STEEL.     MR. BOND wrote:-       &quot;As was anticipated in my notes last month,  theproduction of pig iron and steel in April showed a  declineas compared with the  previous months,  the production of pigiron declining from 592,600 tons In March to 555,0^0 tons inApril, and steel production from 793,300 tons in March to644,100 tons in Aprils  Part of the decline in the  case ofsteel is attributable to the Easter holidays but the declineis greater than can be wholly attributed to this cause *
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD, )Imports of iron and steel in April showed a slight declinefrom 271,500 tons to 252,700 tons, and were the lowestIn any month since the coal stoppage; they still, however,represent an annual, import of 3,000,000 tons.  Exportsalso declined by the substantial total of 65,000 tons to344,300 tons.  The most significant feature of the Importreturns is the small dimensions to which imports of.pigIron have now been reduced; they amounted to 8,100 tons InApril compared with 16,9JO tons in March and have thusfallen below the pre-war average of 15,400 tons per month in 1913.  While this indicates that Continental pig ironis no longer competitive in British Markets, pig Ironmakers have not been able to make any Impression onContinental markets, since exports of pig iron onlyamounted to 28,200 tons.  In the main pig iron producingdistrict - namely the North East Coast - the pig ironposition is fairly firm and prices have been maintained for foundry and basic iron, but hematite is a weakmarket, and two furnaces which were making ferro alloys areceasing operations.  The pig iron position is not sohealthy in other parts of the country, and in SouthStaffordshire prices have weakened owing to price cut-ting.       &quot;In spite of the hardening of Continental steel prices, and the longer time required for delivery, no&quot;      :stimulus has been given to the home demand- for steel whichis still on a hand-to-mouth basis, many works hardly knowingwhere to look for their rolling programme from day to day.       &quot;Owing to the award in the Ruhr coal mining dispute,domestic prices for German iron and steel products have been increased from 4/- to 7/- per ton but these Increases havenot been applied to export prices.  They should, however,have the effect of discouraging exports from Germany; but so long as these prices do not react on French and Belgianprices the situation in Great Britain cannot be any easier,&quot;     LORD GAINFORD had only a gloomy report to give of theNorth East Coast Industry.  There had been no improvement inthe month of May.  Stocks of foundry and basic iron wereup ten thousand tons.  Unexecuted orders s-howed a veryserious shrinkage, very little fresh business having come forward to take the place of the old contracts as theyexpired.  Hematite told no better story.  The market was apparently unable to absorb what was an exceptionally smalloutput, and it certainly looked as though this small output would have to be further curtailed, or stocks seriouslyincreased.  The manufacture of this class of Iron stillshowed a big loss to. the makers.  One furnace makingferro-manganese at Dinsdale had been damped down during thejnonth, and another at Carl ton either had been, or was shortlygoing to be, damped down,  British steel works had loss workon hand than during the previous month, so there wouldappear to be a general and gradual reduction in the workwhich was coming forward.   No orders for ships had been
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.)placed on the North, East Coast during the month under review.The order for the Delhi Bridge, involving about 17,000 tons ofsteel, had been secured by Messrs. Braithwaite, who would dothe greater part of the work at their shops in India, presumablyobtaining most of the steel from the Tata Iron and SteelCompany.   Continental prices were from time to time reportedto be firmer, but a German quotation for 300 tons of bloomsfor export, to Japan was said to have been  5.-2. 0 per ton.o,b. compared with British prices of about  6,10,0 per ton.As before, British consumers saw no attraction in makingforward contracts for their requirements.     MR. PUGH felt with Lord flfainford with regard to the heavysection of the industry.  Some little consolation was tobe drawn from the fact that the tendency on the Continentwas for an increased cost and price.  Reference had beenmade by Mr. Mitchell (see &quot;General Trade in Scotland&quot;) tothe effect of this upon the imports of pig iron.  Thedifference between the price of Continental pig iron andNo.3 Cleveland was about 4/- per ton, but the freight charges were sufficient to keep the former out of ourmarkets.  The number of blast furnaces in operation, andthe unemployment, at the end of April remained about the sameas in March.  As to finished wrought iron, there had beena slight improvement in marked bars and other high classes,but considerable internal competition existed owing to thefact that in that trade there was no satisfactoryorganisation amongst the producers.    In.structural steel there had been a falling demand.In rospect of foreign billets, which formed a large pro-portion of our imported material, the differences in prices were such that there was a considerable amount of Britishmaterial being used in place of the imported commodity.Unemployment generally showed a slight increase for the  pastmo nth.     The tinplate trade was much more satisfactory.  A largenumber of mills were put into operation during the month,and unemployment had dropped correspondingly with theincreased amount of work,  it would appear that therestriction in output under the scheme of standing millsfor three weeks in each quarter, had been modified inconseqience.  In the galvanised sheet trade there had been an improvement at the end of April?,, but a tendency to falloff during last month, prices dropping somewhat lower;  but theseprices were deliberately cut in order to meet a new form of competition from Belgium for getting into the thin gauge sheettrade; and this effort made by producers in this country hadbeen successful in preventing that competition fructifying.
*T) rj f\IRON AND STEEL (CONTD).     we had still got the scrap problem.   Was there anything to be added to what was stated by the President at the lastCouncil meeting when he indicated that this country had not taken up her quota of French scrap?     THE PRESIDENT observed that a meeting had taken place with the various parties concerned.   The railway companies were also being approached.STEEL.     SIR A. BALFOUR observed that the home trade had fallenoff considerably.   They had again got Into a state of pricecutting in every direction, and the curious situation nowexisted in which many companies - even in Sheffield -were either in the hands of Liquidators or committees and yet they carried on and never seemed to wind up.     SouthAmerica was most hopeful as a newer market, Canada was good, Australia fair, New Zealand was decidedly good, and china continued good.     There had been a steady improve-ment in Japan, and Austria was better.     There had been rather a better demand for alloys, but on the whole thesituation was not good.NON-FERROUS METALS.     -SIR CECIL BUDD observed that the setback which he had had to report at the last two meetings of the Council hadnot been recovered, and whilst one or two of the non-ferrousmetal Industries were well employed, generally speakingthe trade had remained very dull and the promise of theearlier part of the year had not been fulfilled.     Therehad been some activity in the copper market, but he was afraid that that was chiefly due to the expectation thatthe American combination of producers were going to  put the price up, which indeed they had done;  it was not dueto any accessions of important orders to manufacturers inthis country.      G-generally speaking, it was to be feared that the small engineering trades throughout the country were doing badly, and that the larger trades also,  -  withthe exception perhaps of tinplates,&quot; cable making and acertain amount of railway work, - were in a somewhat poorcondition.
?71waxENGINEERING.     MR. BilyWNLIE recalled&apos; that at a previous meeting hehad referred to the state of unemployment in the engineer-ing Industry in general and among the members of theAmalgamated Engineering Union in particular.   Accordingto the Ministry of Labour Gazette there were in December,1927, 84,964 -unemployed, or 805fi- in the engineering trade.Corresponding figures at April 23rd, 1928, were 83,370unemployed workpeople or Qu6&apos;fL   In the amalgamated engineering Union, in July of last year&apos; there were 14,099members unemployed, a percentage of 6,78;  these figurescontinued at much the same level with the exception ofFebruary of this year when they fell to 6.24.   In april last they were 13,506 or 6.52$&apos;     Now, as to the particular Industries in which theUnion found its&apos; members most fully employedff   the electrical industry might&apos; be said to be fairly good inJanuary and February;  in March good;  and fajrly good inApril.   The railways, fair;  motor -and cycle industryvery good in January, good in February, very good in March,and fair  in April0   Marine - bad.  Shipbuilding very badJanuary,  bad February and March, and very bad in April,Textile industry, bad.   The general state of trade wasslack, but fair in March.     Now as to shipbuilding, Great Britain and Ireland,December, 1927, under construction 338 vessels of1,579,713 tons,   January.  as to new work, Iriallsend, atrain ferry steamer;  Glasgow, a 9,000 tons motor ship;Tees, two Canadian lake steamers; Tyne, two steamers;Belfast, three small liners;  and in general, 4 cargosteamers, a salvage tug and three small craft,  February:new work- Barrow- 4 submarines, 1 destroyer; Birkenhead,1 submarine;  Chatham, 1 submarine;   Greenock,  2destroyers;  Clydebank, 2 destroyers;  Hebburn,  2destroyers;  Wallsend, 1 flotilla tender;  Tyne,  21merchants ships on stocks, 1 tug best;  work on the wholeslow.   Up- to March;  very -few. orders for new work;  Tees-side,, heavy depression.   In general, a 20,000 ton motorliner, and a few small craft.   As to April, in general,bad,     Regarding the general state of the industry, and thegeneral attitude of the workpeople and the Unions connectedwith the Engineering Joint Trades wages movement, who hadbeen in negotiation with the engineering employers for an advance in wages, a settlement had been arrived at in Juneof last year relative to the first application for a twentyshilling advance.   A new application was submitted to theemployers in March of this year, and the Unions met theemployers again in April, and were informed that owing tothe present State of the engineering industry they could not meet our claims.  The representatives of the Union decided on that occasion to report to their respective Executiveswhat transpired at the conference, and in the course of thepresent month there would be a further meeting to consider what action should be taken,   So far as Mr.Brownl.ie knew,there was no reason to apprehend any serious dislocationin the engineering industry this year.
BNQINgERIHG (CONTD,)     MR. RICHMOND reported that marine engineeringcontinued to mark time and the past month showed little progress towards filling depleted order books.  Few new contracts had been placed, and there appeared to be littleinducement at the moment for shipowners to place newtonnage.   Marine engines, of course, were not a primaryproduct in themselves, but a means to an end, and, as lord Kylsant had reminded his shareholders at the RoyalMail meeting recently, shipping, and its dependent industrymarine engineering, could only prosper as the general tradeand commerce of the world was maintained and extended.  Ifthere was any improvement in trade, it was very gradual,and the question naturally arose as to whether the marine engineering industry was doing its best to help itself inthe meantime and whether it was generally efficient,progressive and imaginative.  After a critical survey,Mr. Richmond had come to the conclusion that in technicalprogress, and in the application of scientific knowledgeto practical problems, the industry had never been morealert or enterprising than it was to-day.   The shipownerhad never had before him a choice of so many differentvariations of main propelling units.  As an indication of technical advancement, he mentioned the new C.P.R. vesselthe &apos;Duchess of Bedford&apos; which was equipped with oilburning water tube boilers with a boiler pressure of 370lbs,  and a superheat of 250 degrees.  Both the boilerpressure and the temperature of the steam were higher than was usual in vessels of this type, and the equipment was ofgreat technical importance.  The result of the vesselstrials were not yet published, but he believed a very high degree of economy had been achieved.  Another installation,and a very interesting one, that had just been placed was for the application of pulverised fuel to one of theboilers on a vessel of the Blue Star Line.  This was thefirst marine application of pulverised fuel on this sideof the Atlantic, and there was no doubt that it wouldprovide a full scale demonstration of what was going to bean important development, and would be watched with interest in marine and shipping circles.  Mr,Richmond had also mentioned, at a previotis meeting, the P. and 0. vesselpresently being equipped with turbo-electrical propulsion,and those examples shored, he thought, that the marine engineering industry was not wanting in enterprise and effort, and that everything v;as being done towards securingnew and more economical forms of steam propulsion andsteam production.  In the Diesel engine department therewas also a considerable amount of development and activity,with unfortunately at thi.; stage great diversity of design and no apparent emergence of any standard type.  However,on the whole, it could be said that at no time and nowherecould the shipowner have his varying needs and requirementsbetter or more economically met than he could in GreatBritain to-day.
&apos; gTGINBERING  ( CONTD . )     On the labour side no further developments had takenplace on the wages application, and it was very gratifyingto hear from Mr. Brownlie that he was not anticipatingany trouble in that matter.  It -was also satisfactory to note that the A.S.U. Council at Southport had passed, bya large majority, a resolution agreeing officially torecognise payment by results, and to negotiate with theemployers for a controlling agreement.  The outstandingfact in the employment figures was that, over the whole range of engineering, marine engineering unfortunatelywas the most depressed section.     In the locomotive department several good orders had recently been booked, constructional engineers were fairlyactive, and the machine tool trade reported improvement.In Scotland generally, the position outside the marinesection was fair,     THE PRESIDENT remarked that what Mr. Richmond had said about efficiency of marine engineering was fairlyborne out by the fact that we were preserving and possiblyincreasing our proportion of shipbuilding of the world&apos;stonnage, our share being as high as, if not higher than, itwas before the war.     SIR ERNEST FETTER regretted that he could not butassociate himself with the somewhat gloomy report onengineering generally which had been given by Lord G-ainford,Mr. Brownlie and Mr. Richmond,  There were indications atany rate, of a worsening of the position which we had reached earlier in the year.  The slackness of shipbuildingwas affecting both general engineering and marine engineering at the present time.  &quot;With regard to what mr.Richmond had said about the up-to-dateness of marine engineering, Sir Ernest wished to add this with regard toDiesel engines, that it was a very serious fact thatpractically all the Diesel engines being built in thiscountry today were being built under Continental licenses,and very large sums of money were going out of the countryfor these licenses. It was believed that not more than tworeally British Diesel engines were being manufactured hereat the present time.  Large sums were being paid to continental designers of engines, not so much on anypatents that they had but on their ability to furnish us with designs and drawings, and give people who had notDiesel experience the ability to build these engines,     As regards the Budget, the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Board of Trade had stated on 14th&apos;May that the ratesrelief scheme would afford relief to the engineering industry, including marine engineering, of from 2 to 2-g-millions sterling per annum.  It would be very welcomenews to the engineering Industry if they could be told theywould have it this year instead of next.  It might be themeans of getting some of them on to their legs.
MOTOR MANUFACTURE AND SHIPBUILDING.     SIR JOHN TEORNYCROFT wrote:-       &quot;This season of the year is always the motor carmanufacturers1 busiest time.  Both car and commercial vehiclemakers, with few exceptions, are fully employed.  Body workfor motor coaches and omnibuses Is in arrear.       &quot;There seems to be an increasing tendency on the partof American firms to send over chassis parts unassembled and complete the vehicles here,  The actual cost of assemblingchassis parts is a very small proporvion of the whole cosl,While some gain must occur in the cost of shipment, one wouldnot expect it alone to make it worth while to establishorganisations for doing the assembly work here, and it wouldseem that they get an advantage in some ^ther way.       &quot;The export of commercial vehicles has been fairly satisfactory but the slump in rubber has affected sales to the malay States,  British exports of commercial vehicles to SouthAmerica have improved.       &quot;Marine motor manufacturers have for some timeexperienced very keen competition from the importers of american motors into this country but, this year, not onlymotors but completely equipped boats are being imported.Very considerable business Is also being done with outboardmotors to attach to the stern of small boats.  They aremanufactured in very large numbers in the United States,American firms having practically the monopoly of them,although one or two firms in this country are trying to compete.  There Mas been a great deal of propaganda with aview to increasing their use in this country.  Without anysafeguarding the British manufacturers will have little chance of competing with the importers.  The marine motormanufacturers have been urging the necessity of safeguardingall thoir products for some time,       &quot;As regards shipbuilding, the competition to secureorders for the smaller classes of vessel is so great that itis impossible for builders to secure orders at prices whichwill fully cover their establishment charges and a good manyorders have recently been taken at prices which will barelycover the labour and material.&quot;M OT OR MANUF A CT TIRE.     MR. EUR COMB observed that at the last meeting of theCouncil Sir John Thornycroft had said that manufacturers ofcommercial motor vehicles appreciated the rebate  which wasto be given on the existing scale of duties on vehiclesequipped with pneumatic tyres; but he had referredspecially to the particular type of vehicle which weighedjust over 2 tons and which, he said, was penalised by an
Ay (f jxm.de sir able jump in the taxation scale as compared with a vehicle just under 2 tons.  He said that the vehicle just over 2 tons, which was a type that the War Office subsidises,had paid  40, and the one just under 2 tons,  26;  that infuture the vehicle under 2 tons would pay  25; and that the gap of  15 was a very undesirable feature from the point ofview of the manufacturers,  But Sir John had overlooked thatthe particular type of vehicle of which he was speakingmust, by the War-Office specification, be equipped entirely with pneumatic tyres and, therefore, under the new plan would pay not  40 but  32, so that, as the lighter vehiclewould not be entitled to the rebate in respect of pneumatictyres, the gap would now be only  7, and the former gap between those two types of vehicles would be just halvedunder the Chancellor&apos;s new proposal.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.     Sir PHILIP NASH said that in the heavy electricalindustry the demand in the home market had fallen off recentlyand was very distinctly below normal.  On the other hand theprospects appeared to be fair for an increased demand inthe near future, for the reason that the electrical powersupply industry last year had shown a record increase of something between 24/c and 26)  compared with 1926, althoughthe 1926 figures were spoilt by the coal strike.  At themoment undoubtedly the electrical power supply industry wasoperating at a very high level of production.  They had had to follow an ultra cautious policy for some - time pend-ing the national schemes which were going to come intoforce.  That had had the result of holding back the usualdemand for generating and transmission plant.  As theschemes came out, and three of them had been produced,more work would be realised.  At the present time, of thethree schemes that had been brought out - Central Scotland,South Eastern England (including London) and CentralEngland - orders on only one had actually materialised,so that lator on in the year probably there would be something like normal activities.  To-day undoubtedly thehome market was distinctly below normal, and moro so than six months ago.     The increase of 24 to 26 per cent, in the generation ofelectricity in this country since 1926, which Sir P. Nashhad already referred to, compared with a 9 per cent, increasein -America, a 5 per cent, increase- in France, a 34- per cent.increase in Italy, and a 19 per cent, increase in Germany.It did look as though an improvement was really takingplace in this country in the use of electricity.  Another           -MOT OR MANUFACTURE (CONTD.)
ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES (CONTD.)point which was worth mentioning was that Industry generally in this country was responsible for 70 per cent, of theconsumption of power that was generated, though at presentin Great Britain industry was only 48 per cent, electrified,as against 73 per cent, electrification in America, and67 per cent, in Germany,  There was also a distinct down-ward tendency of price for -electricity in this country, andthat was all in favour of stimulating demand for equipment.All those figures appeared to indicate that a start hadbeen made and that the demand for equipment would increase.     As regards exports.  Great Britain last year undoubtedlymore than held its own Jn the world&apos;s market for electricalmachinery, but for some reason there was a lull during thelast five or six months in the export demand.  It was not because we had lost our competitive position at all.  Itappeared that the principal export buyers were holding back,and probably installation had for the moment overtaken thedemand, but the figures for 1927 of the export of electrical machinery from this country, compared with theother four main producing countries showed that GreatBritain led as she had led since 1925.   Great Britainlast year exported 31,4 per cent, of the world&apos;s requirements,America 29.1 per cent,, Germany 30,4 per cent.  It did notoften happen that th.e er/oort demand was down at the same time as our home demand, but at the moment that was the position.The most serious competitor we had was Germany, and theycompeted less in the heavy plant than in the lighter articlessuch as small motors, where they were undoubtedly gainingground.  The home demand for this lighter plant was alsopoor because Industry was not buying.  The price of electrical products, due to competition, had been steadilyrailing ever since the beginning of last year, not only for export but for home also, and that was due to excessivecompetition.  Foreign makers, the Swiss particularly,were slack and they were making very strenuous efforts tofind business in this country, with the result that there wasa tendency for prices to fall further and there was never atime when electrical plant was cheaper in this country thanit was to-day.COTTON.     MR. LEE observed that the heavy trade in textiles still remained slack.  They were running short time and the marginsthat they could get were, no doubt, not producing a profit:but he did not think they were any worse than they had been amonth agoj  if anything, they were probably just a shade better.     The fine trade, as reported a month ago, was meeting with a poor demand, and that had not Improved,  The spindles
n 7 7                        COTTON   (CONTD,)were still running full time, but there must be anaccumulation of a very  considerable amount of stock, and ifthe trade went on for many more months as at present it would possibly be necessary to curtail working time.  In this trade the changes depended to a very considerable extent onfashion, and the demands might alter at any moment.  One ofthe chief reasons for the slackness of trade in thisparticular part of the industry would be the tremendousincrease in the cost of Egyptian cotton.  Until customers-ma do up their minds that Egyptian cotton was going to stopat u high figure, out of all relation to its real valuetaking production and consumption figures into account, and much in excess of the usual difference between it and american cotton, or until a drop to a reasonable price tookplace, there was not much likelihood of a very strongbusinessj it would probably be more or less restricted.     Then, in both the heavy and in the fine trade, thedemand for a reduction in wages, which was happily now out ofthe way, no doubt did a very great deal of harm.  It stoppedorders, it destroyed confidence, and it undoubtedly affected the whole trade.  At the present time there was this dispute in Nelson which was serious, because it was not a dispute on wages but on principle, - one cf the most dangerous disputesthat could arise.  It was very difficult to say how far itwould go.  wir. Lee was hopeful that good sense on both sideswould lead them to an arrangement.  Then there was the uncertainty with the finishers and dyers.  They were having a dispute over wages.  In Lancashire there could not possibly be good trade while any dispute, was either in progress orpending.  Of course all these things had held up there-construction schemes that had been under consideration.   the amalgamation of a considerable number of mills would, hethought, be a solution for the heavy trade in the spinningindustry in Lancashire,  Whether it could be carried out seemedsomewhat doubtful, but he thought that If the bankers were  tostep In it might be done.  The- bankers might, however,  shrinkfrom forcing this re-construction.  They were, perhaps,frightened of losing even small customers, and of givingoffence.  In any case It would be very desirable if the trade of Lancashire, which was now distributed among hundreds orthousands of little mills,  were amalgamated into a smaller number of powerful concerns.  This would induce cheapness ofworking and have many other advantages which might help insaving the trade.     MR. McKENNA said that the unwillingness of the banks toexercise coercive powers in the cotton trade or any othertrade was not clue to the fear of losing accounts or offinancial losses.  Personally he would be always, as far ashe could judge, strongly opposed to any concerted coerciveaction by the banks.  Thore was ground for fearing that,should the- banks begin to exercise concerted coercive action,the public might come to remove the independence of the banks.The power of the banks, if they acted in concert, was so great that he would recommend the trade never to encourage thorn toact in concert.
COTTON (OONTD).     On the other hand, he cvould assure Mr. Lee that the bankswould gladly co-operate with the trade when the latter brought forward their scheme, and said what they wanted to do.  Butthat would be a very different thing from the banks initiatingcoercive action against individual companies.     SIR KENNETH D. STEWART confirmed generally what Mr. Leehad said.  May had been an extremely flat month, very much likeApril, only perhaps a little more so.  One of the interestingthings that had  occurred was a demand that had sprung up from china, and for piece goods too.  Probably it arose verylargely out of the extraordinary exchange position.  Theexchange suddenly ran up from 2/7d. to the tael, to about/lOl-d, which meant that in China, which was one of the fewsilver using countries left, goods actually were suddenlyreduced in price during the month to the consumer by 10 percent.  Of course that stimulated  business considerably, but probably only temporarily.     There was hardly any point in any other market that was worth referring to.  Business in fine goods seemed to be making pretty steady progress, though it was going ahead ratherslowly, but there were no particularly encouraging features.As Mr. Lee had remarked, there had been a lull, hut that might change very rapidly at any moment.  With lower qualities, weseemed to be holding eur own abroad without making very much progress in getting back the trade we had lost, but we did not seem to be losing very much more for the time being.  Thefinishing end of the trade, of course, was the only part in aposition to make concessions, and they were doing so steadilywhere competition was hitting them;  there had been certaindecreases in their prices for dyed goods, where competition was most severe, especially from Japan.     It was a very serious thing and a tremendous detriment tothe trade in this country when disputes were in the air, evenif they did not materialize.  There had been a threatened look-out in the spinning trade, which was averted.  It was really acry of despair on the part of the spinners and one mustsympathise with them, although one did not sympathise with theparticular means they adopted to put their position right.There was also the stoppage in Nelson.  Mr. Lee had describedit as one of principle;  Sir&quot;Kenneth thought it was rather anexhibition of temper.  One could not get at the bottom of it.That was the one section in which it had always been understoodthat the position of labour from the employment point of view,was better than in any other trade.  It seemed that a good many people in Manchester took rather a cynical view of it, asbeing rather a question of the division of spoils.  Of course,these troubles meant the holding, up pf a good deal of business,because people could not place their orders while any threatwas going on;  there was always the possibility of the goodsnot being delivered.  Seasons did not wait and if goods werenot delivered, or were delayed, they had to be held over for9^9

Therefore merohantsboth, here and abroad would hold back their orders, and finally if the difficulty was not settled rapidly thebusiness would go elsewhere, and onoe it went elsewhere itwas extremely hard to get back.WOOL.     ME. AYKROYD said that at the moment a very awkwardposition faced the Bradford worsted industry.  Machinery hadbeen running on old business already plaoed, and the positionnow was full of anxiety because new business was not comingon.  In fine qualities, material was accumulating, and,owing to the system which was now current of extending&apos;the selling season in Australia, another difficulty was addedto the many which confronted manufacturers and spinners.Formerly the raw material, was sold between September and december and the season&apos;s orders were plaoed by manufacturers and merchants in those months and were covered by rawmaterial in Australia sold at that period.  That meant therewas an abundant supply during the period of time that the manufacturers and merchants here wanted to place their ordersNow the selling season went on until the end of April andthe amounts sold at one time were more restricted.  It wasno good delivering winter goods in summer and summer goodsin winter, and beyond a certain period the manufacturersoould not go.  As soon as they tried to place their ordersthey found the quantity of raw wool available wascomparatively small and the price went up.  Then the manufacturer started out for a higher price and the trader*ro ci TH &quot;4 oa o/l   T^Vi &quot;1 a V\a/^ T-N^eiam nrn^ n rr r\y\ -Pnv ciotroyio 1 tr a v* *i  V.nfprior to the war it had not existed at all.  It was a matter that Mr. Aykroyd considered should be taken up by the&quot;Chambers of Commerce and was hardly one for a GovernmentDepartment.   The trade was suffering very badly indeed fromthe fact that there was too muoh machinery, and themachinery was beginning to dictate the price.  Until therewas improvement in that direction there was no hope of ageneral improvement, particularly with this  awkward handling of raw material.  In order to deal with the situation on lines of rationalisation, an Association had been formed in the single yarn trade with an agreement as to conversioncosts, but otherwise leaving freedom to everyone.  A goodfirm would not, however, shut dawn part of their machinery in order to help a poor firm.  On the whole, the association was working well and had been welcomed by the trade.  Therehad been no attempt whatever at price dictation, becausethe conversion costs had been fixed on such a basis thatthere was practically no margin at all.  If the worstedtrade could be divided into sections and each sectionadopted .the same method, it would save a tremendous amountof loss &quot;and produce more regular employment.
9 O ACOiTFILWriAL.WOOL (CONTI).).     In the last  week  in May an  interesting  internationalwool conference had  been held  in Jraris which had  been discussing questions of detail in the  industry.   agreement had been reached  at  committee  meetings with  regard  to  thedifference in  counts in connection with worsted yarn,  andthis agreement would be discussed by  the various  associations and brought before the full Conference to be held at the  endof the year.   Similarly an agreement had been  reached  forthe limitation of credit, steps  were  to be taken  to bring this into force as soon as possible,  and a report was  to  besent to the Bradford Chamber of  Commerce before 1st Novemberas to the steps taken  by the various  associations.  Competi-tion had been  going,  on with regard to  credit for  some  yearsand many, firms, if they found  competitors granting  six months,had granted nine  months, or if they found that others  weregranting nine  months, had gone to twelve months.  The  agree-ment reached at the  Conference was that no credit siiould  begiven beyond a period of  six  months for wool, tops and yarns,and not more than three months of this period  should be opencredit.  An agreement had also been reached  on a  unifiednomenclature for  customs and statistical purposes in the  wooltextile industry.  Germany, Italy,  France, Belgium, Czecho-Slovakia and Great Britain had agreed  upon a draft  outlineunder this headin&amp;,  and a further committee  meeting was to beheld in November  with a view to  a definite agreement being brought before the full Conference immediately following,-.This was .a most important matter,  because even in the  reportof the Committee  on  Industry and  Trade there was  a great  dealof confusion between woollens  and worsteds,  and there  wasconfusion in issuing certificates for  the export  trade.Mr. Aykroyd suggested that H.M.  Government should inform  theLeague of Nations that the wool  textile  industry were  them-selves endeavouring  to arrive  at  an agreed basis  for theindustry,  for  both wool and hair,  and  that the League  oiNations&apos;  experts  should not proceed with the unified no men-clature so far as this branch  of  industry was concerned.   Theindustry here,  however, would have  a great deal of work to doin regard to statistics.  At present they had. practically nostatistics in  the West Hiding,  where there was a great anti-pathy towards  giving them.   It was  hoped  to alter that.     In the combing  industry,   tnere wat.  a considerable drop in the numbers of combs running.    The  figure the previous month showed 82-g,. of the full capacity of combs,  and it had now dropped to 74.2 $l.   Even with  this  percentage, rawmaterial showed signs of accumulation.   In spinning theposition remained the same.   No new orders had been placedsince master,   but the existing orders  had lasted  out fairlywell and had enabled the same amount of  machinery to be runfor the last few months.  In the manufacturing section,including the dress  trade,  there had been a steady and generaldecline.   The  position was worse  now than it had been  sixmonths ago.   There was a lot of short  time and not more than50), of the looms were running,  as  against 56/. the previous month.   Two weavers were sharing  the work of one loom,  eacntaking half a week,   thereby letting as many people earn a wage as possible.-if?-
9Qifo G J.WOOL (CONTD. )     The men&apos;a wear trade to South America was reportedto be good, particularly in the high class manufacture.The medium class trade was slack, and the low classtrade bad.  During this period of difficulty it seemed that England was having to turn to specialities and to high class work that could not be done elsewhere.  Forsome two years that trade had been very good, whilethe other  had been spasmodic and irregular.  Therewas a sign of improvement of trade in Canada.Business had been held up during the tariff inquiry,but it was hoped that, with the more settled state ofaffairs over there now, business would be good,     MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote:-       &quot;Unfortunately, the trouble in the Dyeing andFinishing end of the Trade has taken a very seriousturn.  We have not been able to arrive at any settle-ment with the Employers, and the Trade Unions havetaken a decision to hand in notices at firms whereoperatives are employed on time rates.  The AlliedAssociation of Bleachers, Dyers, Printers andFinishers have issued notices to the Press that if a dispute occurs at any firm, they propose to lock outthe whole Industry.  Notices have been signed, and ameeting of the Joint Dyers&apos; Executive Committees willbe held tomorrow, at which meeting a final decision will be taken.  If the conference decides to hand innotices, Instructions will be given for them to be -.handed In the following day, to expire on the 14thJune, 1928,  It is not possible to estimate the effectof such dispute on our Export Trade, but it Is sureto be felt immediately in the cloth trade of Huddersfieldand the export trade of Lancashire.  I am stillhopeful that we shall be able to arrive at a settlementbefore a dispute actually occurs.       &quot;I do not propose to deal at length with the wool Textile Trade, as my colleagues will be able tofurnish you with the latest information.  I might say,however, that during the first four weeks in May, theBradford Trade remained very steady, and our averageunemployment figure was 5.09%.   On the 30th May this increased to 8;27;i, but was probably influenced bythe Whitsuntide holidays.  At the came time, myreports indicate that there has been a falling offduring the past fourteen days, and there appears to beno demand for weavers at the moment, although themajority who have been signing our register areoperatives from the Spinning Section&apos;of the Industry.
WOOL (CONTD.)       &quot;In the Heavy Woollen District, the numberssigning for the four weeks were 15.25$, and on the 30th,14,35 .  The trade in this district is very patchy, but aconsiderable improvement on twelve months ago.  In theHuddersfisld trade I regret to say that there has been aconsiderable falling off, and our unemployment figures show a gradual increase every week during May.  I give you the figures because they are iuteresting, althoughfor the week-ending May 50th, they may have been influenced by the holidays.The average unemployment figure covering the whole tradeduring the four weeks was 10.90%, and on the week endingMay 30th, 13,81%&quot;.     MR. ADDISON said that business In the home market durinthe month of May showed two distinct phases.  In the first half of the month there had been a steady demand; during thelast fortnight the demand slackened, and it was difficult togive a reason for this, except possibly that in the weavingtrade in Lancashire and Yorkshire manufacturers were findingit difficult to put forward new business in any weight.  Thegeneral inquiry from the Eastern markets would appear to bein the lower grades of cloth, where low quality artificial silk can be used, and in this class of work there was severecompetition from our Continental competitors.   In theLeicester market, the hosiery manufacturers were busy withartificial silk, and special yarns were in strong demand.The Nottingham lace trade was also taking twist yarns in large quantities.  Trade in the Leek and xaacclesfielddistricts continued unsatisfactory.     India had been distinctly quiet, the strike in Bombayundoubtedly affecting business; Calcutta continued to takelow quality yarn for hosiery, and in Madras the demand wasfair and competition keen.  Business in China  continued dulland only small lots were going through.  In South America,business remained steady, chiefly for hosiery  requirements,and in Brazil the weaving trade was steadily extending its use of artificial silk both for warp and weft.  In australia the demand was keeping good, chiefly for hosiery yarn andunderwear.May 2nd &quot;  9th11 16th,&quot; 23rd.&quot; 30th.12,0213o9414,4614,5420,60ARTIFICIAL SILK,
CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL reported that conditions in the chemicalmarket revived somewhat during April.  A pleasing featurewas the coal-tar product market, where business showedsigns of improving.  The export demand remained much on a level with the preceding month, and trade compared favour-ably with that of the corresponding month of previous years,while reports on May shipments indicated that similarcharacteristics would appear In the statistics for that month.     The Interest of chemical manufacturers, or a numberof them, had centred round the duties imposed as a re cultof the Budget proposals covering essential oils.  Represent-ations had been made and it was learned that the strictscientific interpretation of essential oils would not be insisted on, so that the duty was not to be imposed on essential oils except turpentine.  Turpentine was also used as a raw material for synthetic camphor, a product whichhad to compete with imported natural camphor paying no duty.The manufacturers of our synthetic camphor wanted a rebateon turpentine used in that particular production, but sofar their representations had not been received sympathetic-ally.  They were, however, being continued.     There was one small point outstanding on what was said by Sir David Milne-Watson (see &quot;Gas Industry&quot;) on the dutyon hydrocarbon oils.  This duty had resulted in home-madebenzole being increased in price to a corresponding extent.Benzole was used in the dye industry and in the productionof other chemicals which required benzole as a raw material,and it was hoped that the benzole manufacturers would takea sympathetic attitude and make concessions in contracts for supply of benzole and allied products for chemicalmanufacture.RUBBER.     MR. JOHNSTON wrote:-       &quot;The position of the Rubber manufacturing industry is less favourable than a few months ago.  This is dueprincipally to the upset caused by the heavy fall in theprice of crude rubber, which has involved all manufacturersin a loss of greater or lesser degree according to the viewthey had previously taken of the market.  The Rubber manafac-turing industry is one in which it is necessary to holdlarge stocks of crude material many months ahead of the timewhen the finished goods are eventually sold, with the resultthat a sudden fall In prices causes great embarrassment.  Atthe same time it must be admitted that selling prices havenot yet fallen to the extent that was at first anticipated,due apparently to the fact that all manufacturers have moreor less considerable stocks of rubber on hand, bought at high prices.  Generally speaking, however, and without reference to the particular effect of the crude rubber fall,
RUBBER (CONTD.)it is not felt that business is quite so satisfactory asappeared, to he the case two or three months ago, and thereis a falling off in demand both for home requirements andfor the export trade.  No doubt the unsatisfactory weather conditions of the last few months has had something to do with this state of affairs, and an improvement in thisdirection would no doubt quicken up demand in most of theImportant branches.     &quot;So far as the Tyre seotion is concerned, business isnot so good as might reasonably be expected at this timeof year, and an improvement will have to be shown quicklyIf the season Is not to be disappointing.  The RubberFootwear branch has also been affected by unseasonableSpring and early Summer weather, but there is still plenty of time for matters to be put right in this direction.In the General Rubber Goods industry, which, as has been previously pointed out, is a good index of general tradeconditions, there is a quite noticeable slackness In demand.     &quot;The Export Trade Is suffering from a lack of enquiries from the Dominions and the East, and trade inthis direction is slacker than for some time past.  TheContinental demand3 on the other hand, appears to be fairly satisfactory.   Employment remains fairly good, but Inmany cases manufacture is for stock rather than for actualdemand.&quot;GAS INDUSTRY.     SIR D. MILNE WATSON reported that the demand forsulphate of ammonia was satisfactory in the Far East,notwithstanding the trouble in China.  In this country,although the final figures were not yet available, it looked as if the consumption would be much the same as lastyear.  Considering the depression in agriculture, that mustbe considered satisfactory.  The demand for pitch was lightowing to the continental buyers holding off at the moment,and little improvement might be expected until thecontinental buyers began.  With regard to benzol, theImport duty had had the effect of enabling the producers in this country to put up their price fourpence a gallon.This would benefit the coke industry who were the chiefproducers of benzol in this country, but it would reducethe consumption, he was afraid, to the minimum.   Withregard to tar, the amount of imported bitumen had increasedlargely In this country to the detriment of home producedtar, and it was important that something should be done topromote the use of tar on the roads that were suitable for it.  About 5 or 6 per cent, of the roads which adjoinedstreams might have to be differently treated, but it was important that on other roads-tar should be used.    he recognised the value of publicity in this connection,
                                9 0:cGAS INDUSTRY (CONTD.)and a Gas and Coke Oven Association had &quot;been started,which wag devoting itself principally to propaganda.?ropaganda was also carried on -through the medium of the papers which dealt with roads, but he agreed that a gooddeal more might be done.  The important thing about tarwas that it produced a non-skidding surface to the road,and that was a feature which was the best advertisementfor it.     In regard to creosote oil, in the United States,where practically 50 per cento of the crude tar was usedfor fuel purposes, they were now beginning to distil thetar, and that would have a bad effect on our exports there.The rest of the creosote used in the United States came from Germany.  There again the British producers were proposing to carry on propaganda on  creosote0  Withregard to coke, there had been a slight fall in the price,but the market was now fairly steadya     THE PRESIDENT referred to the question of the GasCompanies participating in the scheme for the relief ofrates.  In his opinion it was not reasonable to bringpublic utility companies, as such, within the scheme, asit would merely result in distributing the amount of money available over a wider area.  There was, however, a greatdeal to be said for giving some relief where a publicutility Company was actually a producer of residuals.  Theimportant thing for the Gas Council to do was to work out some formula which was practicable, so that, if accepted,it could be put into force.     SIR D. MILNE 1ATS0N replied that he was working onthat.  The Gas industry was different from certain other1 nflnatrilfis . honansa . n nfl yt. fYrnri eras. &apos; 1 t. nrvirhi f&amp;ri r*r\lra .which was in competition with coke from other sources,  itproduced tar in competition with bitumen, and sulphate of ammonia which was also subject to competition.  It , was,therefore, a productive industry up to a certain pointaGENERAL TRADE.     LORD GaINFORD, speaking for the Federation of BritishIndustries, said that trade expansion wa3 hanging fire andno definite reaction had been indicated.  The position was likely to change for the worse rather than for the bettersThe situation in America had played an important part in bringing about the stagnation in British trade.  It haddisturbed the price of imported raw material, and it wasImpossible for the Bank of England to give a much neededstimulus by lowering the Bank rate as the american authorities had been able to do.  Speaking in general,there was a development in British trade on the ContinentIn April, and there had been an advance in German coal prices, so there might be some improvement as a result ofthat.
9 Op^0 0-GENERAL TRaDE ( CONTD J     There had been a contraction in the imports of wool,but it was anticipated that the lull in business would onlyba temporary.  The yarn trade had been quiet and prices hadbeen irregular.  Certain spinners had been selling forward for the last three months and forward prices were substantially below present ruling prices.  The demand forhigh class cloths continued to be limited owing to thedispute in the dyeing and finishing industry.  That wascausing considerable anxiety, and as a result trade wasextraordinarily difficult at present.  In cotton the rawmaterial market had been fairly steady.  The Egyptiansection appeared to be stronger than the.American.  Betterprices were being offered by Far Eastern markets and afair anwmnt of business had been transacted with Shanghaiand Hong Kong.  Certain types of cotton piece goods hadbeen in demand for the Colonies and South America for themonth.  The trend of the cotton trade continued to beuncertain, but, provided a satisfactory solution could befound as to wages and hours, an all-round improvementmight be witnessed in the near future.  There was an upwardtendency in the non-ferrous metals trade and prices wereeasier.  The boot and shoe trade had been fairly quiet.The pottery trade had been quieter and new orders had notbeen forthcoming.  Engineering was slightly more hopefuland enquiries and an increase of orders had come to machine tool makers.  Cable makers in the Manchester district were well employed.  Employment in the shipbuilding yards hadbeen fairly steady on the whole.     SIR GILBERT VYL3 considered that there still existedthe uncertain and uneasy feeling which accompanied thinorder books; and, while no kind of a boom was desired,  yetmore actual firm business would be exceedingly welcome  inevery trade.  The labo\ir difficulties in the North in the textile trades had had a disturbing effect all round.     The timber trade reported many arrivals, but few signsof active buying.  It appeared that the market was over-stocked.  A curious thing was the increasing use of manu-factured wo^ds in the shape of ply wood, which was having an effect on the import of lumber to some extent, and possiblymight displace it.     The most welcome sign in manufacturing trades, from thehome-producing point of view, was the high price of Belgianiron which allowed British users to use freely British-manufactured iron, the price of British to-day being belowthe Belgian.  Those people who generally went abroad fortheir stuff, for Instance the tube makers, were buyingEnglish tube strips at the moment, and so were the boltand nut trades.     Another bright sp^t was that the cycle lamp firms  inthe Midlands were very busy as a result of recent legislation.Maters of bicycles and all accessories for bicycles were
hi O iGENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)also exceedingly busy.  Tho boot trade continued steady,though there was room for improvement.  The Leicesterhosiery export trade was reported to be improving;evidently oversea buyers had discovered the superiority of the British-made goods.  The home market, however, wasflooded with foreign Importations;  s.nd it was pointed outthat when the wearers of hosiery in this country insistedupon having British-made goods, then British hosieryworkers would have full employment.     i-R. MITCHELL reported tho following information fromLiverpool;  there was no favourable change to note in thetanning trade, hides had declined in price, tho heaviestfall being in salted Argentines and Uruguays,  This was partly due to less keenness on the part of American and continental interests to buy.  But even present pricesshowed no safe margin for our tanners as compared with theprices at which leather buyers were willing to buy,  Thestock of leather was not large.  The meat condition was satisfactory.,  The condition of the market was better thanit had been for some years.  Firmness in the provisionmarkets had continued throughout the present month, and agood consumptive demand had been experienced and arrivalskept closely sold up.     As regards the lest African trade the import of palmkernels and palm oil showed a decrease during the presentyear.  61,955 tons of palm kernels had been imported intothe United Kingdom during the period January to April of1927 as compared with 59,350 tons imported during the samemonths this year.  The figures for the import of palm oilfor the same periods were 18,050 tons and 12,024 tonsrespectivelya  America continued to take increasingsupplies of palm oil.  The imports of both ground nuts andcocoa into the United Kingdom during the period in .-question tills year showed an increase over last year1.  Itwas a curious fact that whereas the majority of the groundnuts carried to the United Kingdom this year had been bulkshipments from the French Colony of the Senegal, tho wholeof the ground nuts exported from the British Colony of nigeria had been carried to French ports in foreignbottoms.  However, during recent weeks South French portshad also been heavy buyers of Senegal and Gambia groundnuts.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDG3 said that the retail store trade had been showing expansion in many directions although,taking the volume as a whole, it was not as large as mighthave reasonably been expected.,  The factors entering intothe situation varied of course with the locality.  in greater London the large stores were generally showingincreasing business owing to increased spending power ofthe people, which was due to the general prosperity of theCity and the greatly Increased activity in the neighbouringdistricts.  Even in areas where industry was generally,
9 Q 0hi u oGENSRAL TRADE (COIITD .)depressed, the retail store business was showing improvement.The great edvance in the &quot;no deposit&quot; hire purchase scheme had led to expansion of this form of business generally.Some such move was felt necessary at the cheaper end of thebusiness after the housing subsidy ceased last September,and this system had given a general fillip to a largesection of tho furniture trade.  Cash trade was maintaining a fair level, but undoubtedly the tremendous increase inhire-purchase and instalment-buying had led to a closerbudgeting of the incomes of working class and middle classfamilies.  Stores which did both cash and credit businesshad found a general increase in the latter, but at the sametime had maintained their cash business.     The variable weather for the time of the year had hadan adverse effect, particularly in the fashion business.The better end of the retail fashion trade had prosperedowing to the very brilliant London season,  In the wo1Henand cotton fabric business, trade had been below normal,owing to the still greater increase in the demand for and consumption of artificial silk..  The hardware trademaintained a steady volume.  The hosiery and light woollenssections had siiffered somewhat in consequence of the bad weather conditions.  The furniture and furnishing depart-ments supplying household requirements had shown aconsiderable improvement in accordance with theimprovement shown in the general furnishing business; andthe fact that many firms included these goods in theirhire purchases schemes, facilitated turnover.  The trade for June had started well and was expected to be very goodthroughout the month.     MR. McKENiM- said that the position of trade in general was not good0  One bright beam had been flashed fromSir Woodman Burbidge, but perhaps his statement required, alittle qualification if it was to be made of general application.  It was quite true that in the retail trade.the successful businesses were becoming more successful,but Mr. McKenha very much doubted whether the purchasingpower of the public was increasing in equal proportionwith the success of the very big businesses.  He thoughtthat these would find that the conditions were all in their favour in competing with smaller businesses.  Everyimprovement in transport brought more of the public fromthe suburbs and from the remoter districts of the countryinto London, with the result that these businessesattracted the custom which formerly went to the smallshopkeepers in &quot;the suburbs and the country.  In his experience of trade- as a whole Mr. McKenna would not saythat retail trade in general was sharing the prosperitywhich, we knew, belonged to some of the big London houses,and Indeed to some the big houses in tho provincial citiesalso.  Further, the banking business was not, he believed,going to have a very prosperous year.  He thought thatcotton and coal would see to It that banking profits should.not be exaggerated this year.
GENERAL TRADE (CONTP.)Co-operative Wholesale Society,     MR, HAYHURST handed in a statement which is given&quot;below.  There was one remark that Mr, McKenna made, withregard to the purchasing power of the public, which mr, Hayhurst wished to refer to-.,  it was a remarkable factthat throughout the country, except In South Wales and onthe North East Coast, the savings of the people wereincreasing.  It was so even in Lancashire,  In October 1927there were  30 millions of savings In the Society&apos;&apos;s bank,and this amount was increased  to  35 millions in nine months.  Here was an interesting problem for someone to inquire into,  of course there were a great number ofholiday associations in Lancashire and Yorkshire, and therewould be very many withdrawals in the near future eNevertheless the deposits were going tip, and purchasingpower was in evidence as well as savings;  and it certainly seemed that either the people were more thrifty,and at the same time purchased the things they wanted, orwe were in a better case than some people would represent.MR, HAYHURST1S STATEMENT.-     WI have made enquiries Into the question of tradeprospects during the next twelve months, and whilst, ofcourse, it is impossible to give any forecast with any degree of accuracy, I am impelled, from a close scrutiny of surroundings which might perhaps be somewhat local tothe Co-operative Movement, to th-a view that there is everyindication that our sales will be considerably higher forthe year 1928, than those of 1927,  I am strengthened inthis view from the fact that sales so far this year haveexceeded the corresponding period of 1927,     &quot;There are, as I have often indicated, one or twospots in the country which, from a general sales staudpointoare at a low ebb in relation to other parts of the country,I refer to South Wales and the North Eastern district,where the deplorable industrial conditions find earlyreflection in the purchasing capacity of the worker, andmay be the Co-operative Movement is probably the first toreveal the plight of the worker.     &quot;So far as Grocery and Provisions are concerned, one can be somewhat definite in thi3 respect.  I am certainlyoptimistic, but refrain from any expression as to theposition from a marketing standpoint, either as regardssupplies or prices, as of course it will be obvious thatit is well nigh impossible to forecast either of thesetwo points, - atmospherical, local, industrial,  and other conditions each and an having, to some extent,  its effect upon the po s i tlon,

Home Milled prospects are also for a gradual increase in values owing to shortage of livestock and unsatisfactory condition of stocks generally.     &quot;Furniture. - Trade here is only fair - probably due to the unsettled conditions of the cotton industry.Prices are firm with a tendency to remain so.     &quot;Prospects in the Textile trade do not appear brightat the moment, consequent upon the price of both Wool and cotton having advanced considerably during the year&quot;.GENERAL TRADE IN SCOTLAND *     MR. MITCHELL stated that the figures in May showed anincrease of unemployment both In the Glasgow area and inthe whole of Scotland.  In shipbuilding in the Glasgow aresthe figure was 5,542 on 14th May last, compared with3,478, on 24th October, 1927;  the total unemploymentfigure for the Glasgow area was 4(3,709 on 14th May, asagainst 40,911 on 24th October, 1927.   Prospects for ship building were not favourable; very few new orders werebeing placed..  Employment in steel works had not been good,and some of the works in operation had lost a considerableamount of time.  There was one favourable feature:  theimports of pig iron from the Continent into Scotland hadbeen much reduced this year.  Basic pig iron imports inApril were only about 1,000 tons from India and none fromthe Continent, whereas in October last year- imports of basic pig iron were 4.345 tons.  Imports of Forge andFoundry pig iron had also been considerably reduced; only ,071 tons came from the Continent in April, and 1,000 tons from India, a total of 3,071 tons, as compared with 13,641tons in October 1927 and 7,067 tons in December.  There was still a large import of plates from the Continent.  Theprices of iron and steel on the Continent, especially inGermany, had risen, which might be partly due to the swedish iron ore strike;  prompt deliveries could not now be given,and this was in favour of British material.SHIPPING.MR.

EAILWAY TRAFFIC (C OK TD.)     MR. HURCOMB observed that the receipts of the fourrailway groups from passenger traffic for the 21 weeks ending27th May were considerably less than they had been for thesame period last year.  This year, also, a good part of theWhitsuntide receipts were included, whereas last yearWhitsuntide fell somewhat later.  One must, therefore,expect that the existing deficiency in this year&apos;s figures ascompared with those for last year would become still greaterwhen at a later date a closer comparison could be made.     As regards coal, the receipts of the 4 groups for the5 weeks ending 27th May were  210,000 less than they had been for the same 5 weeks of last year, and  for the 21 weeks fromthe beginning of the year were  1^- millions less.  On otherminerals and merchandise the receipts for the 5 weeks were 720,000 less than for the corresponding period last year,and about  1,900,000 less in respect of the 21 weeks.  Theaggregate decline in receipts for the first 21 weeks of theyear as compared with last year amounted to  3,151,000*; but one had to bear in mind that in the early weeks of last year there was still an extra volume of traffic due to thetermination of the coal strike In November 1926.EMPLOYMENT.     MR; PHILLIPS stated that the trend of the unemployment figures since 23rd April had not been at all satisfactory.     A heavy increase had occurred in the last week of April,-and though the figures subsequently recovered to some extent,the total was over 1,100,000 on 21st May.  Compareo with thecorresponding date, 23rd May, a year ago, there was anincrease of 123,000 in the number unemployed.  An analysis..of these figures had been made which showed that of theIncrease, two-thirds occurred in Wales and the Northerncounties of England.  In Greater London there was a smalldecrease in unemployment, and In the South of Englandgenerally there was little change.  The industrial detailsfor May were not yet available, but probably the industries which accounted for most of the Increase in unemployment werecoal, cotton, iron and steel, and the building trades.     Mr. Phillips handed in a table (appended) of Insuredpersons in employment.  This month they showed an actualdecrease, because the Increase in persons becoming insuredhad not kept pace with the unemployment figures,  A drophad occurred of about 24,000 during the month in the numbers in employment.*It may be noted that this figure Is smaller than that for   the decrease In the first 20 weeks of the year given in   Sir J.Stamp&apos;s table above.  The reason for this is that   passenger receipts increased in the 21st week (which   included part of the Whit-Sun holidays) by  379,000,   causing the net figure for total traffic to go up by    169,000,

A Bill was shortly to be introduced into theVictorian Parliament for obtaining uniform marketing conditions for butter, and the export of butter from 1st July, 1927, to30th A-pril last, showed an increase of about 4,000 tons overthe corresponding period of last year.  Recent legislation had given the Commonwealth Authorities control over the inter-State trade in dried fruits.  There had -been a very heavyfrost in parts of Australia at the end of last year whichseriously affected the fruit, and the estimated total pick ofthe present,season was about 29,000 tons less than last year.

INDIAN TRADE.     MR. GORDON observed that there was very little change inthe situation in India since the last meeting.  The industrialtrouble In the cotton mills still continued.  The wheat cropwas not working out as well as had been expected, and thelast forecast had reduced the estimated figures by about1,000,000 tons.     The final accounts for the year ended March 31st, 1928,had now been received.  The balance of trade in favour ofIndia for the year was 49,68 lakhs against 40,13 lakhs lastyear.                 AUSTRALIAN TRADE (CONTD.)The exports of wheat from 1st January to the end of May were32,500*,000 bushels as compared with  62,000,000 bushels inthe previous year, and the total Commonwealth yield for1927-8 was 115,000,000 bushels as against 163,000,000 bushelsfor the previous year.  Exports of flour from 1st january to 31st May this year were 191,000 tons compared with253,000 tons for the corresponding period of last year.There should be a record vintage in New South Wales, butnearly all the other States had suffered from frost.  Therehad been a very large increase in potatoes, exports fromTasmania for the 1928 season to the end of April having been500,000 cases, an increase of 50,000 cases over the previous year, and investigations  were now proceeding to utilisepotato meal for power alcohol and. in any other way that mightbe found, possible.     A distinct reduction had been shown. in imports for the nine months ending 31st March last, which amounted to 116,000,000, a decrease of  10,000,000 from the previous year&apos;s figures.  Exports were  115,000,000, a decrease of 1,500,000; so that at 31st March one might say that imports and exports were approximately balanced.  Bank clearances inall the capitals excluding Hobart from 1st January to 30thApril last had been  746,000,000 as compared with  755,000,000In the previous year.     Negotiations were nearing finality for the establishmentby Stewart and Lloyds of Glasgow of a factory at Newcastlecosting approximately  1,000,000 for manufacture of iron andsteel tubes and. pipes.   The Australian Iron and Steel company had recently been formed with a capital of  3,000,000; thatwas the company in which Dorman Long and Baldwins and HowardSmith were interested  Then there were other industries pro-posed to be established, for  Instance, wood pulp and paperworks in Tasmania, and Lysaght&apos;s Newcastle works had addedfive new rolling mills and increased their production capacity to 5-0,000 tons  per annum of galvanised and blacksheets.  A private company had been formed to exploit the
INDIAN  TRADE (CONTD).     Imports were up from 2,31,38 lakhs to 2,49,90 lakhs, ofwhich the United Kingdom&apos;s share was 1,19,27 lakhs, an Increaseof 8,74 lakhs.  The percentage of United Kingdom imports to total imports was the same as last year, namely, 47.7, and the downward tendency noticed in recent years seemed to have been checked.  Imports into India showed a marked increase under the heads of iron and steel, machinery, oils, railway plant, motors,raw cotton and artificial silk.  The only serious decline wasunder the heading of sugar - all beet sugar from Germany,Hungary and Czeoho Slovakia.     As regards iron and steel imports, the increase in valuev&amp;e 4,69 lakhs.  Out of this sum the United Kingdom had gained2,64 lakhs;  Belgium gained 43 lakhs;  Germany lost 35 lakhs,and the United States of America lost 38 lakhs.  Undermachinery, the inorease in value was 2,40 lakhs, of which theUnited Kingdom gained 1,88 lakhs and accounted for over three-fourths of the whole Imports.  The United States of Americagained 18 lakhs, and Germany 10 lakhs.  Under oils, there wasa considerable decrease in imports from the United States ofAmerica, and an increase from Persia and Borneo&apos;.  Underrailway plant, the total increase was 1,52 lakhs.  The UnitedKingdom gained 1,71 lakhs and accounted for over three-fourthsof the total ipports.  Belgium gained 31 lakhs, Germany lost10, the United States of America lost 11 and Australia lost 13.Under motor-cars, the increase in value was 1,29 lakhs, ofwhich the United States of America gained 63 lakhs and theUnited Kingdom 38 lakhs.

SIR GILBERT GKINDLE remarked that it might interest theCouncil to know that the Jamaica fruit growers during thelast few weeks had succeeded in forcing an association to
9 fi oCOLONIAL TRADE (OONTD.)emancipate themselves from the American United Fruit Company.They proposed to run a line of ships to a west country port.The general policy of the present fruit shippers was not tocarry general cargo, but it was understood that the JamaicaAssociation intended to try to get general cargo to oarryoutwards, and this would afford an opportunity which did not exist at the present moment for trade in British goods toJamaica.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR,. HOSE observed that the general commercial situation inChile had recently shown a tendency towards improvement.-  Retailsales were reported to be on the increase, and a feeling of greater confidence was apparent in the wholesale trades.  Inhis last report to the Council Mr. Hose had referred to thefact that the Chilean Government had stated that no reduction would be authorised in the export duties on nitrate of sodain the period July, 1928 to June, 1929, but that officialefforts were being made to assist the producers in maintaining and extending their sales of the fertiliser.  This statement had been followed by an announcement that the Government had decided to adopt forthwith certain measures of a constructivecharacter.  In the first place a sum of approximately 350,000, derived from receipts from the export duties onnitrate, was to be distributed to the producers, pro rata totheir output, on the understanding that sales should not bemade below 16/4d. per metrio quintal for May-June delivery,or 16/6 for July forward.  In the event of a reduction beingmade this summer in the scale of prices of German synthetic-nitrogen products, a bonus would be allocated by the chilean government to the nitrate producers for lowering to acorresponding extent the prices paid by consumers for thenatural fertiliser.  The  nitrate trade had been in the handsof Englishmen and Germans for the last 40 years, but theChileans had now come in and were becoming rich while the othershad been getting poorer, and there were now only two groups in the trade, the Chilean and the Amerioan, with an occasionalEnglishman concerned in them.  The financial position of Chilewas satisfactory, and showed a surplus on paper.     As regards Argentina, after Dr. Hipolito Irigoyen waselected President a few months ago there  were many fearsthat his election would result in labour troubles.  He was always very much in favour of measures for the workmen, but while he wanted to get all the benefits he could for them,he was ready to adopt things for the good of trade as a whole $and, so far as the railways were concerned, he probably wouldnot foist upon them any increase of wages unless he gave themfacilities for increased traffic  in the Argentine there was an inclination to develop into combinations, and there was reason to believe that there would be a combination of certain of the meat freezing companies of British nationality whichwould form together a strong competitor for the two highly important American packers.  Recently at a meeting of the
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD. )Province of Buenos Aires Watereworks  Company the  chairmanhad referred to the necessity  to  counteract the  purchase of undertakings of that sort by American  capitalists.  Itwas very easy to say It was necessary  to counteract it,but if the Americans liked to  pay the  price demanded,they could presumably purchase anything;  but the chairmanwas right In what he judged to be the  result, namely,that they would get orders for their own country&apos;s goods,and they had been doing so.     In Brazil the position politically seemed to beImproving.  There was a declaration  by Dr. WashingtonLuis that he intended to carry through the stabilisation of the currency.  That was a highly  Important matter.We-had always regarded it during  the last six or eight months as being pretty well certain  of coming into effect.It was interesting to note that the  gold reserve of thecountry showed a ratio of 34.7$ to the money In  circulation,which was quite sufficient to enable them to stabilize.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE said that  in the Argentine hisfirm had large businesses, and found that trade wasexceptionally good over there.  For  the month of May the firm&apos;s trade had increased by over 25%; and had been doing-unusually well for the last six or nine months.  They thoughtthat In the Argentine there would be very good times in trade generally.

FLUCTUATIONS DURING THE PERIOD MARCH 1927 MAY 1928.
9 fStatement regarding the export  trade  position made  at  themeeting of the Advisory Committee  to  the  Department of overseas Trade held on Wednesday,, the  16th May,  1928.     MR. JOHNSTON  (Pottery) wrote  that  the  pottery  trade generally was in a very unsatisfactory  position,  foreign  imports were increasing, while British, exports  were  decreasing.   Pros-pects were gloomy, foreigners  underselling  by  25 to 50 per cent,due to much lower general level  of wages.     MR. BRUCE GARDNER (Iron and Steel)  reported that, althoughpartly owing to the holidays production of  pig iron had fallenslightly, actually foreign  competition  was  being held.    the steel situation was not so  good.   The  tinplate trade  occupieda happier position than recently and  was  operating  to  75  percent, capacity.    In the galvanised  sheet industry  India  wasvery quiet indeed  and the market was  practically dead.    Mr.Gardner spoke of the Increase  In costs  which had taken place  inGermany and said that as a  result semi-finished materials and sections had been  advanced  4/-;   hoops  &amp;/-&apos;,  and wire  rods and heavy plates l/- per ton..   There was certainly a tendency for prices on the continent to  stiffen, which was  all to the  good.     SIR GEORGE SUTTON (Cable  Industry)  said that this was a highly organised trade which was prosperous.   They were  doingwell at home and were also  securing  their share of  export business.   So favourable was  their position that they were able to discriminate between good and bad business  and In caseswhere terms of payment or other  conditions  were not favourablethey did not tender.   He mentioned  that they  did not experiencecompetition today  from Germany,  but  on  the  other hand had toencounter French,  Belgian and  Dutch  competition .     COLONEL COLE  (Motor Cars) said  that in Australia and NewZealand the financial conditions prevailing had reacted  againsttrade.   In India, American manufacturers seemed to be firmlyinstalled;  they had penetrated  the market  during the  war andwere maintaining their position.  In regard to South Africa  theSociety of Motor Manufacturers had recently sent a  delegate to explore the position in relation to motor cars in a practicalway.   Apparently  some hesitancy existed in the minds  of manufacturers as to the practicability  of producing a specialmodel for the market in view of  its  relative smallness.Generally speaking, the problem  was  to  provide- for  many  foreign and dominion markets a cheap car of  high horse power.    Whatwas required was a top gear car, but  unfortunately there  were only two manufacturers  who were really Important  enough to tackle this proposition.     MR. DODWELL  (China Merchant Trade)  stated that the  improve-ment previously reported had been maintained as far as the Southwas  concerned, but that there  was a  falling off in  business in shanghai and tne North.   Everything  depended  upon what  the nationalists would do if they  reached Peking,  which seemedalmost  certain.    On the whole,  the  situation  was not unhopeful.                                                  MR..PARKER/
     MR; PARKER  (Boots and Shoes) reported that  the  trade  hadbeen adversely affe selected by the high  cost  of material,  although not only had the exports of boots and shoes to the United  Statesincreased but also the exports of finished leather.    Theindustry in America was on a  larger  scale than in this  country.Here there were  1000 boot and shoe factories, the aggregateoutput being approximately half  that of America.   A difficulty,however, was the fact that the buying of  finished leather  athigher prices increased the cost of  production here  and made it more difficult for the industry  to compete in the Dominions, but nevertheless business with the Dominions  was well maintained.     MR. ROWLAND (Agricultural and General Engineering) statedthat &quot; here was a slight improvement  in the agricultural machinerytrade and the business had practically reverted  to the  point atwhich it stood prior to the coal stoppage.   The general engineer-ing industry was also in a better condition.   The trade intractors, harvesters and threshing machinery was practicallycontrolled by the International  Harvester C mpany of America,and It was almost impossible for any individual  British firmto attempt to penetrate the consuming markets.   The only  hopewas for combination among British firms,  a course which he hadbeen advocating for a long time.     MR. EMSLEY  (Worsteds) speaking  of the Bradford  trade, saidthat an improvement had taken place  in China, while  in Japanconditions were about the same.   In Australia,  the  Huddersfieldtrade had not been helped by the increased tariff, but as  regardsCanada they had sent a representative to  lay their point ofview before the Tariff Board, with satisfactory  results.   On thewhole, trade during the last  three months had been rather  better.A demand had recently arisen for narrow-width materials which ithad been difficult to meet in Bradford, and consequently the tradewa3 being done by continental firms.   He hoped, however,  thatthis was only a phasing phase.   Speaking generally, Bradford hadmachinery capable of being adapted to the production of the variouswidths required  by the different countries.   Bradford was pro-progressing In technical and general trade adaptability.     MR. GORDON.(Acting Indian Trade Commissioner) said that inspite of a certain amount of industrial unrest the trade positionin India was fairly good. .  The  March figures were not quite as favourable as a year ago, but still  showed a substantial balance in favour of India, and over twelve  months the balance  was about50 crores of rupees as against 40 crores.     There was an increase in imports of  iron and steel, machinery,oils, railway plant and .motor vehicles.   In February machinery was up 38 lakhs, of which the United Kingdom share was  33.  Railwayplant was up 25 lakhs, the United Kingdom share  having  increased bythe same amount.
