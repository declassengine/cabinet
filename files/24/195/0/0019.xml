I  CIRCULATE, for the information of the Cabinet, the attached official letter,dated the 13th March, 1928, from the Treasury to the Admiralty on the subject of thebasis of Navy Estimates,  together with Admiralty  replies  on various questions of detail raised therein.    I  propose  that the Committee of Imperial  Defence should be  asked to advise&apos;the Cabinet upon the general assumptions which should now govern our preparations for war, with  particular  reference to the  Estimates  for the Fighting Services.  i suggest that it should now be laid down as a standing assumption that at any giveudate there will be no major war for  ten years from that date;  and  that this shouldrule unless or until, on the initiative of the Foreign Office or one  of the FightingServices or otherwise, it is decided to alter it.    As soon as this question is decided I propose that the correspondence shouldbe referred to the Naval  Programme Committee of the Cabinet,  which has been formally  constituted a standing  Sub-Committee of  the  Committee  of ImperialDefence,  and that the Naval Programme Committee should be asked to  considerwhether the  policy of the Admiralty, as  embodied  in the Navy Estimates, is inconformity with the above assumption, and  to  make recommendations regardingsuch of the particular questions raised in the correspondence as cannot be settledbetween the Treasury and the Admiralty.    I also propose that the question of the provision of a new type of Anti-AircraftGun for the  Fleet (see Cabinet  9  (28), Conclusion 5, of the  17th February,  andTreasury Letter of the 13th March, page 4), should be referred to the Committee ofImperial  Defence for immediate advice.   This  question is now regarded by theAdmiralty as urgent.                                                                  W.  S. C.    Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,          June 15, 1928.[17710JB

 S. 33101.                             (i.) (Confidential.) Sir,                                      Treasury Chambers, March 13, 1928.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer has reported to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury his recent discussions with the First Lord of the Admiralty, as a result of which Navy Estimates have been agreed at a total of  57,300,000 net for the financial year 1928.     In  these discussions considerable differences were found to exist  between the views of the two Departments as to the proper basis in present circumstances of Navy Estimates,  and the above-named total was agreed  without prejudice to further consideration of these questions.     My Lords therefore think it desirable to set out a provisional statement of Their views on some of the points at issue; They propose that,  after these have been fully considered by the Board of Admiralty, His Majesty&apos;s Government should be  recom- raended to appoint a Committee to examine the whole position in advance of discus- sions on the total of Navy Estimates for 1929. General basis of the Estimates.            .    At  the Estimates  Conferences two very important statements were made as to the Admiralty policy in the matter of preparation against the  danger of a  Great War.    The first statement was that the Board regarded themselves as bound to be fully ready for a Great War by 1935 (i.e., ten years from 1925) and that Admiralty pre- reparations were made accordingly.  This statement appears to My Lords to be out of harmony with repeated decisions of His Majesty&apos;s  Government under which  the &quot;ten years period &quot; is renewed from year to year, and  should now be regarded as running until 1938 at least.   This policy was re-affirmed so recently as the 22nd December, 1927, in the draft memorandum by the  Committee of Imperial Defence on South African Coast Defences, paragraph 5.    Secondly, it was stated  that  the Admiralty, looking ahead  to  the date when expenditure would be necessary for replacement of battleships under the Washington Treaty,  were endeavouring, so far as possible, to liquidate their present commitments by 1931, in order to  be able to release funds for new construction after that date.  My Lords do not, however, consider it to be certain that fresh expenditure on battleships will be necessary in 1931, nor, even if it were certain, could They regard it as  finan- cially admissible to accelerate expenditure in 1928 in order to relieve estimates in 1932.    My Lords  conclude, therefore,  that by  adapting policy: more closely  to  the Governments general  policy as regards preparation  for a Great  War, and  by contenting themselves with a lesser degree of activity during the present period of calm in international relations, the Board of  Admiralty should  be able  to  make substantial reductions in Navy Votes by  a general reduction of reserve standards andby spreading commitments over a longer period.    In particular, My Lords regard the proposed doubling of the output of cordite and  the employment of men on  overtime and  night shift  on the manufacture of torpedoes  as inconsistent  with  the Government&apos;s policy.  My Lords revert to this question below when They deal in more detail with these  items.     Vote &apos;A. My Lords&quot; consider that it should be possible to make further sub- stantial reductions on Vote A.  It would appear that the  effect of the present system of calculating mobilization and peace requirements separately for each branch and of adopting in each case the higher figure is that the total of Vote A for 1928 will exceed total peace  requirements by  5,000 officers and men, who will thus be borne solely to meet the contingency of mobilization.  My Lords find it difficult to reconcile this result with the  assumption that there will be  no major emergency for ten years. The basis of Vote A followed by the Admiralty, while justified in the circumstances obtaining in 1913 when it was formulated, appears to Them not to pay due respect to the implication that complete mobilization in the near future is not a contingency to be taken into  account.  My Lords consider,  therefore, that  it would be  more proper in present conditions  to determine Vote A mainly on  the  basis of peace requirements alone, and that  additional numbers for  mobilization requirements should only be added exceptionally, e.g., in branches where there is a great differencebetween the two standards, or where the long period necessary to train highly-skilled      [17710]                                                       B 2
 men makes it appropriate to have greater regard to distant mobilization require- ments.  On this footing They would expect that a substantial part of the additiona 5,000 men now borne could be reduced.     In this  connexion,  My Lords  would observe that the entry of short-service seamen, which in the  course of  time will produce a valuable reserve available for mobilization, appears to afford an additional reason for discounting future mobilization- tion requirements as now suggested.     It  will, of. course, remain  essential that peace requirements should be fixed at the minimum figures consistent with the needs of training.  My Lords appreciate that substantial progress has been made in the pruning of establishments, and They trust that the Lords Commissioners of the  Admiralty will&apos; continue to give close attention  to this matter.  They would ask particularly that the margins for leave, sickness,  crossing reliefs, &amp;c,  in the peace establishments should be limited to the absolute minimum, and that, especially in the non-fighting branches, no opportunity should be  lost of employing civilians or retired personnel in substitution for active list personnel.     In comparison with 1914,  the ratio of Flag and  Commissioned Officers to men has increased by no less than 26 per cent.  My Lords trust that further consideration will be given to the possibility  of reducing the number of officers,  and that  the particular suggestion made in  paragraph 25 of the report of the Chelmsford Com- mittee will be specially examined with the object of effecting whatever saving may be possible under this head and of finding  at the same time an appropriate solution of the problem of arranging for a satisfactory flow of promotion from the lower to the higher ranks.Reserves of Armaments Generally.    My Lords propose that the reserve fixed  for each main  class  of armament(torpedoes, cordite,  guns,  shells,  &amp;c),  and  the annual rate  of building up  the reserves, should  be  reconsidered by the proposed Cabinet Committee.  Primd facie,They consider that reduction should be  possible on the following lines :&apos;-   ,    (a.) They understand that the full reserve  of 6-inch.Mark 12 guns is reduced           in&apos; the case of ships that are near the age  limit,   They suggest that this           step might be taken further,  both by applying it to other armaments and           by extending it to all but the newest ships.    (&amp;.) Eeduction, at least for the present, should be possible in thecase of stores           which are common to  a large number of units..    (c.) A general deferment should be  possible in the date of completion of reserve           outfits.    It  was  argued in  Estimate discussions  that a certain level of armamentexpenditure was necessary to keep the armament firms in being, but, even  if this is admitted,  it cannot, in Their Lordships&apos; opinion, justify the  maintenance of Vote 9provision  at the high level proposed for the coming year.Cordite.                  -.-     -          . .                    ,    My Lords understand that it is proposed to increase the  output  from 1,000 tons in 1927 to 2,250 tons in 1928 at an increased  cost of  220,000 in order to replace doubtful  M.D. cordite within  four years.  In view  of the Governments general policy and  of the  very large  amount  of cordite  .(11,500 tons,  representing  nine years&apos;   peace  consumption)  at  present held, My  Lords see no reason  why this replacement should not be spread over at least ten years.     They would  propose  to ask  the  suggested Cabinet  Committee to  consider whether the requirements of  cordite need be placed at  so high a figure as 11,500 tons, and whether, in any event,  a temporary depletion of this reserve cannot be faced with equanimity; in the meantime, They  consider that no steps should be taken to employ additional hands at the Royal Naval Cordite Factory. Anti-Aircraft Guns.     My Lords understand that   163,000 (some of which *fails on  Vote 8 for  gun mountings) is included in the  Estimates as  an instalment of full scale production at the approximate rate of one gun and mounting a month of  a new anti-aircraft weapon for dealing with close  range attacks On the Fleet.  The total cost for newer
 battleships, battle cruisers and newer aircraft carriers (to which it is proposed for the moment to restrict supply) is stated to be  1,861,000 for guns, ammunition and mountings,  while  the probable  cost for the whole  Fleet,  omitting destroyers and certain older cruisers, has been put at no less than  3,500,000.   1  *  ..    .    My Lords consider that this1 expenditure should be deferred  pending a review of its necessity by the Committee of Imperial Defence in the light of the evidence to be given by the Naval Staff, and of any views which the General Staff and the Air Staff may be able to put forward.  In the meantime, My Lords raise no objection to the minimum expenditure necessary to prevent the scattering of  skilled workmen. Torpedoes.    My Lords have received certain information in regard to the stock of torpedoes and  proposed  output  for  1928   in   Admiralty  Letter  (C.E./7637/27), of  the 28th  January, 1928.   They  note that,  of 2,654  21-inch Mark 4  torpedoes  in stock, 364 are to be used ill relief  of new construction; They will be glad to learn why this process cannot be carried further, at least to the extent of a temporary deferment of reserves for new construction.    Considerable economy would no doubt be possible if a later-date were allowed for the completion of reserve torpedoes of new types, and, pending an enquiry into the whole position, My Lords request  the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to reconsider the necessity for the employment of men on night shift and overtime. Vote  9.  Miscellaneous.    My Lords suggest  the  omission  of all  provision for  equipment of Armed Merchant Cruisers; a reduction in the issues of practice ammunition (observing that the Army Council have made a considerable cut in this respect in view of the need of economy); the deferment of proposed expenditure on reconditioning lower  grade T.N.T. to bring War  reserves up to specification standard, and  the spreading of proposed expenditure on the replacement of anti-gas apparatus. Fleet Air Arm.    In view of the present state of Naval Aviation generally and of the marked lead already possessed  by  this  country, My Lords  consider that  substantial reductions might  safely be effected in this Branch of expenditure.  They propose to ask the suggested Cabinet Committee to enquire into the whole question with the assistance of the  Naval Staff and the Air Staff; in the meantime, They suggest that the Lords Commissioners of  the Admiralty  should  consult the Air  Council  with a view  to making an economy of at least  50,000 on  the provision included in the Estimates. Reduction of Ships in Full Commission.    Considerable reductions in naval expenditure might result from a reallocation of the proportion  of ships in full commission, reserve and care and  maintenance. It would doubtless be  accepted that in peace  conditions  this allocation should bemade  on the basis of maintaining in full commission no more  vessels than are required for essential peace duties and for the purposes of the tactical training ofthe Fleet.  While with a reduced  Navy it may be necessary, in order to meet these requirements, to maintain a higher proportion of vessels in full  commission, MyLords  would urge the Board of Admiralty to give further  consideration to the possibility  of &quot;increasing  the  number  of vessels in  the various categories  whichpermit of reduced complements. Vote 10 (Works).    This Vote  requires to be submitted to Their Lordships in detail, and, pendingTheir reply, inclusion of a new service in  the Vote does not imply sanction thereto..At  this stage,  therefore,  My Lords content  Themselves  with  the following observations:           &quot;    In view of the decision of the Cabinet of the 22nd February, that in regard tothe construction of Oil Tanks the Admiralty should proceed on the assumption thatthey will not be required  next year to carry out  the full programme of  Oil Fuel
accumulations, My Lords understand that no expenditure on new storage will beundertaken in 1928.  .                                         -      -  --    My Lords view with some concern the very large schemes, costing over  250,000in all, proposed at Chatham Dockyard, the retention of which is of doubtful- necessityfor Naval needs and which is dangerously exposed to hostile attack under modern conditions, and They would be glad if the proposals could be drastically revised fromthis point of view.  -              -                    I am, Sir,                                      &apos;  Your obedient Servant,                                      (Signed)      R. V. NIND HOPKINS. N. 10.66/28.   : Sir,                                        Admiralty, S.W. 1, April 13, 1928.     With reference to your letter of the 13th March (S. 33101) on the subject of the Navy Estimates, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request that you will inform the  Lords Commissioners of  His Majesty&apos;s Treasury that, after, careful consideration of the comments made in that letter in regard to Vote A, they are unable to accept the view that it should be possible to make further substantial reductions in Fleet numbers.     2.   Their  Lordships of the Treasury suggest  that it would now be proper to depart  from the basis of Vote A  as laid down in 1913, the object of which was to ensure that Fleet numbers should be sufficient to allow of naval mobilisation  and also to carry on the peace training of the Fleet and those normal reliefs of personnel and material which are necessary to maintain the efficiency of both, and that mobilisation needs should be ignored for the present, save in exceptional cases.          ----------     3-.   My Lords are unable to concur in this proposal, as they consider it to be a fundamental.principle that to whatever extent the  Fleet may be reduced in size we should at least always be able to man it.                .    &apos; .     4.   Already the  active service personnel  of the British Navy has been reduced to a much lower figure (in relation to the size  of the Fleet to be manned) than either the United&apos;States  Navy or  the Japanese Navy.  The  United States numbers,  are 112,000 and the Japanese 81,943, as compared with 101,000 for the British. Navy, or  -if the Royal Air Force personnel serving with  the  Fleet Air Arm be included  103,000.  Now that the commanding superiority in material  formerly  possessed by the British  Navy has been  resigned and  the principle  of a one-Power  standard vis-d-vis the United States of America has been accepted, the only element  of naval superiority which this country can reasonably  hope  to retain  is to be found in  the training and experience of the personnel of the Fleet.  To reduce-the strength of that personnel by far below the ratio of material strength in which we stand to the United States and  Japan would  be inconsistent with  the public professions which  His Majesty&apos;s Government have made on the subject of the Navy, and to which My Lords conceive it to be their duty to conform.     5.   It is  conceded, moreover,  even by  Their Lordships  of  the Treasury, that mobilisation requirements  cannot  be ignored  &quot;in branches where there is a great difference between  the two standards, or  where the long period necessary  to train highly-skilled men makes it appropriate to have greater regard  to distant mobilisation requirements.&quot;   In point of fact,  the present  excess  of  mobilisation over peace requirements is almost entirely in the Seaman Branch,  in which precisely the fore- going conditions  exist.  Owing to  the vastly increased complexity of the equipment and armaments of modern ships,  a largely  increased proportion . of  the  Seaman Branch in a ship&apos;s company must to-day  be highly-skilled  men, who have passed through considerable  periods of training.   In the latest type  of battleship  the per- centage of seamen who must hold non-substantive ratings is no less than 55 per cent., and in  the latest type of  cruiser  it  is  61 per cent.  The actual period required to produce the more highly qualified specialist ratings or  an experienced  and efficient Petty Officer is little short of 10 years.  The principle, therefore, of ignoring mobility- sation needs could not be applied without seriously affecting the efficiency of the Fleet at a distant period of which the circumstances cannot possibly be foreseen:    6.  The fact is, that the considerable excess of mobilisation over peace  require-ments in this Branch  has been brought about principally in order that  the  numbers for essential peace needs (particularly training) may be provided without adding tothe accepted peace margins.  These margins have been found to be quite insufficientin this  case to  provide the essential numbers  for training,  leave, sickness,  crossing
I reliefs, trials, experimental services, &amp;c, for the reason that, as compared with 1913,1 a much larger proportion of the Fleet is&apos; serving  abroad, and  the  demands forI specialist  training have, as already mentioned, greatly increased.I    In order to meet- this&apos; situation the Admiralty during recent years  have adoptedI and carried to the utmost extent possible the policy of reducing peace complements1 of ships in commission below war  complements, : thei --reductions made  being theI following:-                   -       - &apos;  .......    &apos;/     3rd Battle Squadron (&quot; IRON DUKES &quot;)              About 3/5ths complements carried, pMs boys.     All other Battleships and Battle Cruisers              Peace complements are about-85. per cent, of war complements.     Cruisers in Atlantic, Mediterranean, America and Africa Squadrons, also the         &quot; ADVENTURE,&quot; &quot; ADAMANT-&quot; and  V ALECTO.&apos;-&apos;       .-             About 3/5ths complements carried, plus boys.   Peace complements are                 about 85 per cent, of war  complements.    Destroyers and Leaders              A reduced  engine room complement borne. By this means an additional  number of men available for  training, &amp;o, has been provided, and a considerable expansion of the margins, which would otherwise have been necessary, has been avoided.  In addition, the system of crossing reliefs which existed before the war has been given up to a great extent,  and ships from Foreign Stations are, whenever possible, brought home to recommission in order  to economise. personnel,  in spite of the  fact that thereby it constantly happens that Squadrons are below strength.    7.  The result of adopting the proposal of Their Lordships  of the  Treasury would obviously be to stultify all that  has been done with the object of making adequate numbers available for training, &amp;c.    8.  With regard to the remarks of Their  Lordships of .the  Treasury  on the number of  Officers,  I  am  to  explain  that  requirements of Officers generally are calculated on peace requirements, the additions required for war being Retired or Reserve Officers.  In this case also, however, experience shows that the accepted peace  margins are barely sufficient, owing to the changed conditions already referred to.    9.  It  is not clear to my Lords how the calculation that the, ratio  of Flag;  and Commissioned Officers to men has increased by  26 per cent, has  been arrived  at. Taking the Executive Branches only, the ratio of Flag and Commissioned Officers to remaining Officers and men was 4-4 to 100 in  1914, and  is now 5-3 to 100.  It will be recollected that the  Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the discussions oh the Estimates that he would expect the ratio to have increased.    10.  As regards the reference  to paragraph  25  of the  Chelmsford Committee Report, I am to state that its proposals have been adopted as far as possible, and that the numbers quoted in Appendix (A) of the report have been considerably reduced.    11.  Close  attention is being, and will  continue to be,  given to the possibilityof reducing Shore Establishments, for instance, arrangements are already in progress for closing the Port Edgar Destroyer Base, which will effect a substantial reduction&apos;of personnel.    12.  The suggestion  that in the non-fighting branches (by which it  is presumedsuch branches as  Writers,  Cooks and Stewards are meant,   although these ratingsequally have their duties  in the fighting organisation of the ship) civilians or retiredpersonnel should be employed for Active  Service ratings is obviously not applicableto the Service Afloat.  In regard to Shore Establishments it  is only practicable to alimited extent, since these branches must, for reasons of health and efficiency, have their alternations of sea and shore service, like other branches;    13.  In conclusion,  My Lords desire me to  state that the fact that the royal navy is being run on a much smaller proportion of Active Service personnel than anyother important Navy in the world is strong  evidence of the economy which is beingpractised in this sphere of naval administration.  My Lords are the more surprisedto receive the comments of Their Lordships of the Treasury&quot; ori this point, since theyunderstood that at the recent discussions the Chancellor  of the Exchequer expressed himself as fully convinced of this.                                                I am, Sir,                                                      Your obedient Servant,    The Secretary,                      .    (Signed)       O. MURRAY.        H.M. Treasury, Whitehall, S.W. 1.

With reference to your letter of the 13th March (S. 33101) on.the subject,of theNavy. Estimates,  I am commanded by My  Lords Commissioners  of the  admiralty to request that you will inform, the. Lords Commissioners  of HisJVEajesty&apos;s Treasurythat they have given careful consideration  to the comments made in that letter inregard to                                                            ....           ,(i.)

Provision of equipment for Armed Merchant Cruisers.          (vi.) Reduction  of  practice ammunition.1          (vii) Expenditure  on reconditioning T.N.T.         (viii.) Expenditure  on Anti-Gas Apparatus. -     Under the heading (i) Reserves of Armaments, Their Lordships of the Treasuryexpressed the opinion that a reduction in  the reserves and  in the  annual  rate ofbuilding them up should  be  possible on lines which My  Lords will now  discussseriatim     (a.)  The full reserves of guns of  all types, except  those held  for the newest           ships, to be reduced, as an extension of the policy by which the full reserve           of 6-inch Mark XII guns is reduced in the case of ships that are.near the           age limit.                                                     .     This proposal leads My Lords to think that Their Lordships of the Treasurysuppose that reserve guns  are merely kept in store in order to provide  against therisk of ships having their guns disabled by premature bursting of  shells, destructionby the enemy, &amp;c, and that They have not  realised that  all guns mounted in shipsrequire to be removed (generally by complete broadsides) for relining after a certainlife, when they are replaced by guns from the reserve.  As the relining of guns is alengthy process (occupying 15 months in  the case of 15-inch; guns), the  number of reserve guns is not an actual number available, but a theoretical number  available if no relining were in progress.   In addition, the reserve at. home has to provide all the guns required for proof and experimental purposes  and  for use  in the training establishments.  Other considerations bearing on the life of the gun are, it  is true,also taken into account, but statement (A) attached will show how little margin the reserves  provide  having regard to  the  current  needs for  relining,  proof andexperiment, and training purposes.  The  statement may  also serve to make  it clear to Their Lordships of the  Treasury that the reduction in the full reserve of 6-inchMark XII guns is possible because guns will actually become available from  ships already near the age limit to meet relining and other requirements.     As regards the rate of  providing the  reserves of guns, it must be explainedthat the reserve guns are actually required early  in the period of  building the ship,as several are required at  each of the gunmounting works  for pit trials, balancingof mounting, interchangeability of gun parts, &amp;c, and also at Shoeburyness for range-table firings, determination of charge, proof  of cordite, proof of projectiles and proof of fuses.     (b.) A reduction, at  least temporarily, in the case of stores which are common to           a large number of units.     My Lords understand that this suggestion refers particularly to the possibilityof reducing the reserve of ammunition below one  complete outfit in cases in which alarge number of guns of the same type are mounted in the Fleet.     The Admiralty have,  as  a matter of fact,  applied a policy  having somewhatthe same.effect as that suggested by the Treasury to the  reserve of  ammunition for ships approaching the end of their  life.  In such cases the reserve of ammunition is reduced to 50 per cent. 3 years before the date of scrapping the ship  and to 25 per cent.12 months before the  same date.  Except,  however, where ships  are within a fewyears of the end  of their life, My  Lords consider  that the reduction to one outfit,which was approved after  the war, represents the minimum reserve that can safely
be maintained,  and They are unable to accept the principle of pooling  reserves ofammunition because there are a large number of guns mounted.    Although the number of guns in the Fleet varies, their ammunition is distributed,not only in peace but also in war, over various areas. For instance, the reserve outfitfor the guns of the Battle  Fleet are distributed in peace at Malta and in  GreatBritain.  If the Fleet have to operate in the Far East, a portion of the Fleet would inevitably be left  in  Home Waters.   The reserve ammunition for the remainderwould have to be  transported  to an Eastern Base.  Transport in war must alwaysinvolve risk, a risk which might in future be very considerable.    The  reserve ammunition for Cruisers, also-, has to be distributed over a largenumber of focal points, and it is impossible to foresee  for certain in advance which of these  will become  of greatest importance.   Consequently,  ammunition may notbe distributed on  the outbreak of war to  the  best advantage for replenishment.Although, therefore,  at first sight it  might appear mathematically true that thelarger the number  of guns the less the amount of reserve ammunition that would berequired, this argument is not actually sound,  as  the reserve ammunition for thelarge number of guns  would not be concentrated at one point, nor yet necessarily be distributed in the way that best suited a particular  emergency.   There is  a verygreat danger that  these difficulties may be lost sight of through fixing the attentionon the experience  of the last war, when the Fleet  being in the North Sea, had thefull advantage  of  our Home Bases.    In addition to the ammunition requirements  for Fleet actions, provision hasalways to be allowed for subsidiary operations which may be required.  Cruisers and destroyers may also expend large quantities of ammunition in their duties on patrol,in bombardment of strategical points, such as wireless stations,  oil-fuel installations,all of which  ammunition has to be replaced from the  scattered reserve  outfit.    The  Battle Fleet, moreover, may be called on to attack by bombardment enemy positions.  An  outfit  for a ship of the &apos;&apos; Queen  Elizabeth &quot; or  &quot; Royal Sovereign &apos;&apos;class is only  100 rounds per 15-inch gun,  which might easily be expended in a few hours.    For  such reasons it is considered not only to be fully  substantiated  that aminimum reserve  of one outfit is a reasonable basis, but to cause grave doubts as tothe adequacy of such  a limited reserve.  It must be borne in mind that if additionalhardened shell  are ordered on the approach of an emergency, the first deliverieswould not take place in less  than 15 months.    It has not been possible to ascertain  what  reserve the U.S.A. keeps, but it isknown that Japan retains 2 complete outfits per ship and France 1\ complete outfitsper ship  in reserve.    (c.)  A general deferment in the date of completion of reserve outfits.    My Lords are unable to concur in this suggestion for the following reasons :     Firstly, it  is  more economical to  order ammunition in one contract than to spread it over two contracts placed some years apart.    Secondly, the type of ammunition, torpedoes and guns remains the same for theship during her life; so that by deferring, e.g.., the provision of ammunition for a shipordered in 1928 until, say, 1932, we might be involved in manufacturing both old andnew types of armament simultaneously, which would be objectionable both from the standpoint of factory  organisation and economy.    Thirdly, the  quite temporary gain would be small and would be offset to someextent by the higher price charged for the initial equipment and probable claims forsubsidies.    (It will, of course, be realised that  all reserve outfits for existing ships and ships under construction are already provided or in course of contract.)    Under  the heading  (ii)  Requirements of  Cordite,  Their Lordships  of theTreasury stated that, in view  of the Government^ general policy and  of the verylarge amount of cordite at present held, They see no reason why the replacement ofcordite due for scrapping under ordinary rules in 1928 and ensuing years, and thatwhich it  is considered necessary to remove from His  Majesty&apos;s Ships owing  to itsunreliable conditions, should be spread over at least ten years.    On this  point My Lords  desire me to remark that they have no knowledge ofany declaration of policy by His  Majesty&apos;s Government which authorises them toleave large deficiencies existing in these reserves. On the contrary,  the Controller of       [17710]                                                         c
 the Navy, on behalf of the Board of Admiralty, is required annually to give a certifi- cate  to Parliament, which  is printed in  the  Navy Appropriation Account, in the following terms:           &quot; I certify that on the 31st March,  19  , the authorised  War Reserves of     Naval  Armament Stores  for the provision and  maintenance of which I am     responsible were  in all respects complete (with  the  exception  of temporary     deficiencies to the aggregate value of  about           ).&quot;     My Lords desire me to point out that, even with the replenishment spread over 4 years and not allowing for any Cruiser,  Destroyer or Submarine programmes after 1929, there will be a serious temporary depletion of reserves to be mentioned in this Certificate varying  from 300 to 2,000 tons for the next four years, and  My Lords think it probable that They may be required to assure the Committee of Public Accounts that the deficiency is being made good with all speed and is  not being left for future Governments to deal with.    My Lords cannot therefore agree to reduce the output of Cordite in 1928 below that which is provided for in the Navy Estimates as presented to Parliament.    Under  the heading  (iii) Provision of Anti-Air-craft Guns,  Their  Lordships of the Treasury suggest that the  expenditure in connection with  the development of this weapon shall be reduced to a minimum until its necessity has been reviewed by the OLD. &quot; in the light of  the evidence to be given by the  Naval Staff, and of any views which the General Staff and Air Staff may be able to put forward.&quot;    In reply I am  to state  that in arranging to equip only the more  important of His Majesty&apos;s Ships with this essential weapon, and also to spread, the process over four years, My Lords have already cut down to the barest, dimensions that they can contemplate the provision necessary  for meeting the very dangerous form of attack by Torpedo-Carrying Aircraft.   Ships are  at present without any effective means of defending themselves against this  menace, and the Admiralty  cannot agree to this state of affairs being deliberately prolonged now that a satisfactory reply has been developed.  It would have been just  as reasonable for Their Lordships of the Treasury  to  propose that the bulging  of large ships should not be proceeded with, notwithstanding the knowledge that this is an essential defence against Torpedo and Bomb attack.   The  danger from Torpedo-carrying Aircraft is not confined to the type  of  war which, under the policy of the Government, is not regarded as  an immediate contingency.  It  might equally be encountered in minor operations, and therefore the arguments which  Their Lordships of the Treasury base on that policy do not apply in this case. The Fleet,  moreover, in the course of its ordinary training, is frequently engaged  in exercises involving Aircraft attack on ships, and so long as the latter are allowed to appear  to be defenceless  against Air-Torpedo attack, a false and somewhat demoralising state of things must be perpetuated.  It must be remembered, too, that  even when  these  guns  have been  installed  in  ships,  the personnel will require to be exercised in  their use, and that it will be some years before the Fleet will have been trained to get the utmost value out of them  and to draw  correct tactical conclusions.    The  Air Ministry has  been fully associated with  the  production of the new weapon, both through  their representative on the Committee which originated the proposals, and during the  subsequent seven years of experimenting through their representative on the Ordnance Committee.  That the Imperial General Staff would feel competent to express any views  with  regard to the proper equipment of  ships, which is a highly technical matter, and on a form of attack to which ships alone are open,  is scarcely to be believed.   But, in  any  case, My  Lords must insist that this is a responsibility of the Boa,rd of Admiralty, on which they alone are competent to advise the Government, and  as to which the views of the Imperial General Staff are not relevant.    In  addition to laying  these considerations  before  Their  Lordships  of the Treasury, I am to explain that the point  has been reached at which the Admiralty cannot reasonably expect Messrs. Vickers to continue to keep together the skilled, staff which has been engaged in the development and manufacture of this weaponunless a  substantial  number of guns is ordered, and grave  difficulties will  be encountered later if this staff is disbanded.  On the financial side the cost would bevery largely increased if the guns proposed to be provided;over the next four years were  spread  over a longer period.  My Lords, therefore,  cannot  agree to alter theprogramme already approved, under which orders for these guns will  be  placed  atthe  end of this month.
[17710]DJ    Under the  heading,  (iv) Requirements  of  Torpedoes,  Their Lordships of the Treasury enquire why the use of 21-inch Mark IV Torpedoes already in stock for new construction cannot be carried further,  &quot; at least to the extent of a temporary deferment of reserves for new construction,&quot; suggest that considerable economy would be possible if a  later date were allowed for the completion of  reserve Torpedoes of new types, and  ask that  the  necessity  for employment of men on night shift and overtime at the R.N. Torpedo Factory may be reconsidered.     In reply, My Lords desire me to explain that, allowing for a normal wastage on account of losses up to and including 1931,  on the one hand, and,  on the other hand,  for the availability of Torpedoes released from vessels due for scrapping, the whole  of the 2,654 Torpedoes, 21-inch Mark IV, and also 422  Mark V, are already absorbed in providing outfits and reserves for vessels in existence or building, the greater number  of them composing the  actual outfits of His Majesty&apos;s  Ships.  It is impossible, therefore, for further requirements of new construction to be provided from this source. The reserves of Torpedoes have already been temporarily reduced to a very substantial extent, viz., in the case of Cruisers of the &quot;London &quot; and later classes, by 50 per cent., and,  in the case of Destroyers and Submarines, by 33^ per cent.   In view of the very small expansion of the power of producing Torpedoes which is capable of being brought into operation in an emergency, My Lords do not consider it practicable  to carry this policy further.    I  am to add that the necessity for  employing men on double shifts, &amp;c, at the Torpedo Factory is not due to pressure of manufacture in the ordinary  sense, but to the fact that  the accommodation does not  provide adequate space for the assembly of parts (which  requires a large floor area) so as to keep  pace with the processes of manufacture. (v.) Provision of Equipment for Armed Merchant Cruisers.    Under this  heading, Their Lordships of the Treasury suggest that  all provision under  Vote 9 for the equipment of Armed Merchant Cruisers should be  omitted.    In reply, My Lords desire me to point out that Armed Merchant Cruisers providethe necessary  supplement in time of  war  to our  Cruiser forces  in  various oceans,without which our  trade, including vital food supplies,  cannot be adequately pro-tected  from attack by enemy raiders.  The alternative to Armed Merchant Cruisersbeing immediately available when the need arises is the building of a larger numberof Cruisers than is now contemplated.   It is, therefore,  necessary that the specialequipment required for  Armed Merchant Cruisers should be gradually providedduring the period  when  there is no  immediate fear  of a great war.   The  totalprovision under Vote 9 for this purpose is  6,000, and, under any reasonable estimateof the  length of time over which the provision of such equipment might be spread,this must be regarded as an insufficient rather than ah excessive sum.(vi.) Reduction  of Practice Ammunition.    Under this  heading, Their Lordships of the Treasury suggest &quot; a reduction inthe issues of practice ammunition (observing that  the Army Council have made aconsiderable cut  in this respect in view of the need of economy).&quot;    In reply, My Lords desire me to point out that there is no real analogy betweenthe requirements of practice ammunition for Fleet and for the land service.    It is essential that each ship should not only be trained to fight as a single unit,but also to co-operate with her consorts against&apos;both ships and aircraft.  It must beborne  in mind  also that ships pay  off and ^commission every 2   years.  Thisnecessitates recommencing training to a very large extent at the  beginning of eachnew commission.    The allowances of  certain  items of practice  ammunition have already beenreduced in recent years,  as a measure  of economy, both in respect of the allowances for working up on&apos; commissioning, and on change of Gunnery Officer, as will be  seen from the following table :

My Lords are  of  opinion that the allowances now approved are the minimum which will enable efficiency to be maintained.(vii.)  Expenditure on reconditioning T.N.T.    As regards the proposal to defer this expenditure, I am to explain that the bulkof the reserve is not fit for use in its present  unpurified state.   It would not thereforeserve  the purpose for which it exists in the  event of an emergency occurring, and itcannot be turned over, as is desirable.  If put into an efficient condition, it can beregularly turned over by drawing upon it for filling shell, mines,  &amp;c.   It is  already the intention to spread the work over 4 years, which, in view of the great importanceof the reserve to the Navy, is considered to be a reasonable period to allow.
 (viii.) Expenditure on Anti-Gas Apparatus.    Their Lordships of  the  Treasury suggest the &apos;&apos; spreading&apos;&apos;  of the proposed: expenditure under this heading.    In reply, My Lords desire me to explain that it is necessary for anti-gas masks to be assigned to each Officer  and man individually as an article of personal equip- ment, and that the present life of the apparatus is only five years.  The provision is already being spread, and under the present programme the Fleet  will not be fully equipped with efficient respirators for  about 3 years.    If the programme were extended, it is impossible to say when the Fleet would be fully equipped, as respirators already supplied  would, need renewal before  a complete  supply  had been  made. This is a vital defensive requirement, the need  for which might arise urgently in any minor operations which the Fleet might be required to undertake, and is therefore in a different category from requirements for a great naval war, and Their Lordships cannot agree to postpone it further.   The total expenditure included on account of it in the Estimates for 1928 is only  16,000, and is a very small fraction of what  isbeing spent by the 3 Fighting  Services on Anti-Gas equipment (see Army Estimates,1928, page 182).            .

With reference to your letter of the 13th March (S.33101) on the subject of theNavy Estimates, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty tostate, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, that theyhave, as requested, made a very careful review of the provision made in the estimates for the development of the Fleet Air Arm.    2.  In general, My Lords are satisfied that the rate of development at which weare aiming is extremely moderate, having regard to what is being done by the otherchief naval Powers, and that  it cannot be further reduced.    3.  They observe that Their Lordships of the  Treasury refer to the &quot;markedlead &quot; which this country possesses.  It is true that up to the present time we havepossessed a lead in Aircraft Carriers, but with the commissioning of the &apos;&apos; Lexington &apos;&apos;and  &quot;Saratoga,&quot;  this is no  longer  the case.  In the  installation of catapults theTJ.S.A.  possess a marked lead.    4.  My Lords are, however,  prepared,  on reconsideration, to defer until some later  date the provision of   the Spotter Reconnaissance  Flight included in  theEstimates  as one  of the two  (originally four)   new Flights  to  be  formed  inDecember 1928.     5.   The reason for this postponement  is that  an investigation into the  wholequestion of  the numbers and  types of aircraft which should be included in the fleet air  Arm when it reaches its full expansion has been in progress for a considerable time, and has led to  the conclusion  that the proportion of Spotter/reconnaissance aircraft should be less than was originally contemplated.     6.   This being so, the provision of Spotter/Reconnaissance has got rather  ahead of other types, and the present number will, it is  considered, suffice for immediateneeds.  If other new types (Fighter/Reconnaissance or Torpedo/Bomber) had been
in production, it would have been proposed to substitute a Plight of one of thesetypes for the Spotter/Reconnaissance Plight originally proposed.  Unfortunately,however, these new types are at present only in the design or mock-up stage.  MyLords, therefore, now propose to defer the provision of the Spotter/ReconnaissanceFlight, and to form only one new Plight of Fighters in 1928.    7.  It will be necessary to consult the Air Ministry, in order to ascertain whatreduction in expenditure this year will result.  My Lords, however, are of opinionthat it will amount to approximately  72,000.                                          I am, Sir,                                                Your obedient Servant,    The Secretary,                               (Signed)       O. MURRAY.        H.M. Treasury, S.W. 1.                                      (v.)M. 01102/28.Sir,                                          Admiralty, S.W.1, April 12, 1928.    I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request thatyou will inform the Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury that Their Lordshipshave had  under their  consideration your  letter of the  13th March  (S. 33101),and that they desire me to make the following reply to the suggestion that furtherconsideration  should be given to the possibility of reallocating the proportion ofships in full commission, reserve and care and maintenance.    2.   Their Lordships  of the Treasury have not failed to recognise that, with a reduced Navy, it is natural that a higher proportion of vessels should have to beretained in  full commission, in order to carry out  essential  peace duties and toprovide the  necessary Tactical Training of the Fleet.  My Lords would again lay stress on the fact that, now that Great Britain&apos;s former superiority  in material hasbeen relinquished, the only superiority on which we can build is the possession ofa more experienced  and  highly-trained  personnel, and  that without  adequatetraining at sea, this advantage will also vanish.    3.   The question of further reduction of units of the Main  Fleet has been thoroughly and  repeatedly investigated.  These main units form the only trainingcentres in  which the officers and men can learn and practise the tactics of war, andTheir Lordships are satisfied that reduction is  not possible if the necessary training is to proceed satisfactorily.    4.   Although we aim at maintaining 12 Battleships  and 3 Battle Cruisers infull commission, the periodic necessity of refits, recommissioning and large repairs,rarely, if ever, allow of all these ships being present with their respective squadronsfor exercises.   Thus,  for  4 years  from May  1928  onwards, there  will always be heavy ships undergoing  large repairs,  two of which would normally be  fullycommissioned ships and one a ship with reduced complement.  It is therefore fair to say that, on an average, 20 per cent, of the heavy ships which should be availablefor Tactical Training must be absent from their squadrons.    5.   In all tactical exercises the lack of Cruisers  and Destroyers in numbers pro-portionate to those that would be present in war lends unreality to  the work of theFleet.  Only two Cruiser Squadrons and four Destroyer Flotillas are maintained withthe main (Mediterranean) Fleet.   It has recently been necessary to reduce even oneof these squadrons by a Cruiser, in order to add her to the American and West IndiesStation to carry out essential peace duties.    6.   Nothing can better illustrate the  severe pruning to  which  the Fleet hasalready been subjected in order to meet the demand for  a reduction in public expen-diture than  the  recent necessity to reinforce our Naval Forces  in the Far East.  Inorder to bring about this reinforcement, the Mediterranean Fleet was reduced to oneCruiser Squadron, with serious damage to its training.   In order to send a force ofMarines to China, all drafting of Marines had  to be  suspended and training entirelydislocated.    7.   Owing to the small number of ships available, it is already  impossible in most cases to employ a Captain more than 3f years  at sea, wliich means  that he is away from the sea  for about two-thirds of  his time on  the  Captain&apos;s list.  Out of  thismeagre period,  it is usual for an  Officer to have  about 2 years in command of a smaller cruiser, and less  than 2 years in command of a capital ship,  10,000-toncruiser or aircraft carrier.
    8.  The  numbers of ships on foreign stations are regulated  strictly by peacerequirements, and are undoubtedly below what is really necessary.  For instance, forseveral years  past the Board of Admiralty have received from the Foreign Office, notonce or twice^ but repeatedly, strong representations by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers inSouth; America  that Great Britain&apos;s commercial  and other  interests are beingseriously damaged by the absence of the British  Flag from South American Waters.The  squadrons on foreign stations, moreover, are frequently and for  long  periodsbelow their nominal strength, as, in order to reduce manning requirements, ships aregenerally brought home to recommission.                                              I am, Sir,                                                  Your  obedient Servant,    The Secretary,                              (Signed)       O. MURRAY.        H.M. Treasury, S.W. 1. C.E. in C.                           (vi.)      1758/28/68b.Sir,                                        Admiralty, S.W. 1, April 13, 1928.    I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to request thatyou will inform the Lords Commissioners of H.M.  Treasury that Their Lordshipshave had under their consideration your letter of  the 13th March  (S. 33101) and that they desire me to make the following reply to the comments on Vote 10 (Works).Oil Tanks.    As already  intimated to Their  Lordships of the Treasury, Vote 10 for 1928includes  221,500 in all for the continuation and completion of oil storage installa-tions  previously  approved.  No provision is made for the commencement of any newinstallations, in accordance with the Cabinet  decision of the 22nd February.  ButMy Lords understand that the intention underlying this  decision  was that theamount of oil fuel to be added  to reserve in 1929 should be decided in the early autumn of  1928,  and,  if that decision should make it  necessary to  commence newtankage in 1928, sanction to the work being put in hand  would.be forthcoming, although it is not provided for in the Estimates. Vote  10.  Chatham Dockyard.    My Lords are unable to accept the suggestion  that  the retention  of  ChathamDockyard is  of doubtful necessity for Naval needs.   On the contrary, for storagepurposes alone this Dockyard is essential to the Navy, and, although its building and repairing facilities are on a somewhat smaller scale than at the other, two  HomeYards, it is still the principal yard for repairs to Cruisers, Destroyers and other small vessels.  The Yard&apos;s 8 dry docks and basin accommodation of 69 acres are constantlyin use, and apart from many other objections,  it would  be impossible for the otherHome Yards to undertake the work done at Chatham without large capital outlay on them.  As regards exposure to hostile attack, the  relative disadvantages in thisrespect of the Southern Yards were fully realised by His Majesty&apos;s Government inNovember 1925.   Nevertheless,  it was decided that  the  Southern Yards should beretained and Rosyth  and Pembroke Dockyards closed down.  In these circumstances,My Lords see no prospect of dispensing with Chatham Dockyard and cannot agree tothe Yard&apos;s efficiency being impaired for want of upkeep and renewal of essentialbuildings and plant.   The expenditure will be amply repaid by the resulting economyduring the period of years in which Their Lordships of  the Treasury are precluded from  anticipating any European emergency.   I am to point out that  in recent yearslarge expenditure on the provision or improvement of military accommodation and facilities in the Kent area (Canterbury, Chatham, Dover,  Lydd,  Shorncliffe,  Wool-wich) has been included  in Army Estimates,  to which  the  same contingency  ofexposure to hostile air attack in the event of an European war applies.    The total cost of  the proposals for Chatham Dockyard is  not,  however, over 250,000 as stated this figure seems to refer to the combined total Vote 10 work forthe whole Chatham Command.   The total for  the Dockyard is  181,472 (including 138,120 under Vote 10) of which  66,122 is for three items already approved, whilst the new items Nos. 4 to 10 are either for the replacement of worn-out buildings and
 plant or for the provision of new appliances necessary  for efficient and economical working.     No. 11 provides for alterations in the drainage system in  Chatham Dockyard. At present the crude Dockyard sewage discharges direct into the Medway, an objec- tionable practice which has long been condemned on grounds of public health, and which has been allowed to continue only because the local authority&apos;s system has not hitherto been capable of dealing with the Dockyard sewage.   The Borough Council for G-illingham are, however, about to extend their sewage works to meet the growing needs of the Borough  and to take  the sewage from that portion of the Dockyard which lies within the Borough boundaries,  and it is anticipated that the necessary connections for the Dockyard will be available early in 1929. In these circumstances, My Lords are of opinion that the present system can no longer be continued  and that it is necessary to make a start in 1928 on the work of connecting the Dockyard drain- age system with  the Council&apos;s system.    Apart  from the Dockyard items,  the  Works proposals  for  the  Chatham Command includes a most urgent and important scheme  (No. 14) for the transfer to Chatham of the  Naval  Artificer Apprentices&apos;  Mechanical Training Establishment now accommodated in hulks known  as H.M.S.  &quot; Fisgard &quot; at  Portsmouth.  These hulks have become  increasingly  unsatisfactory in recent years from the point of view of the Apprentices&apos; health  and training,  their cost of maintenance is high and the extension of their  life beyond  1930 would involve considerable  additional expen- diture.   My  Lords  are,  therefore, of  opinion  that the  provision of other accommodation for the establishment can no longer be delayed.  Various  alternatives have been considered, and that now proposed is the most economical that can be found.    The scheme  provides for the conversion and enlargement  of  certain  disused Detention Quarters at Chatham to accommodate the Apprentices, who number about 750, and for their necessary instructional  and other facilities.   The Apprentices&apos; instruction requires that the establishment) should be close to a Dockyard, no buildings are  available at Portsmouth or Devonport which could be adapted for the purpose, and the  cost of a completely new establishment would be, roughly, half a million, apart from the high cost of the purchase of the necessary land in proximity to either ofthese Yards.                                     I am, Sir,                                            Your obedient Servant,    The Secretary,                               (Signed)      O.  MURRAY.        H.M. Treasury, S.W. 1.                     &apos;                           j
