DRAFT MEMOEMDPM.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.I circulate for the approval of the Cabinet a draft.   of the Memorandum on Local  Government changes involved in the   scheme of  Rating  relief.  (Though technical in character and   necessarily somewhat lengthy the Memorandum is I think fairly   clear but  I oall  the attention of my colleagues to the following   points as  they may have some political significance.2,            It will be seen that the proposals in connection with   Poor Law Reform involve the abolition of the Guardians and the   transference of all their functions to County and County Borough   Councils.    A careful study of the question showed that it was   impossible to maintain the  modification proposed in 1927 by which   outdoor  relief would still  have been administered by Guardians   (with some modification of  their constitution) as this would   necessitate the charging of the cost of cut-relief on areas too   small to cope with its fluctuation after the derating scheme had   coma into  operation.       ^maintenance of scheduled roads from the District Councils to the counties will rob the Rural District Councils of the bulk of thework which now occupies them,  and they may be expected to resist the change, pertinaciously, since they will see in it their owndeath warrant.   Their opposition may perhaps be mitigated bysome concessions as foreshadowed in paragraph I4(iii).          The formula as stated appears complicated, but the only thing which will matter to the Local Authorities is the effect it3.The transference of the responsibility for the
   will produce on the  grant to be  made  in each individual case.   It 13 on the tables,  rather than on the formula that attention   will be  concentrated.5.           On page 19 it is revealed that the various   adjustments proposed will in some cases lead to an aotual   increase in rate poundage, and It is proposed to give a guarantee   that this shall not in the case  of non-county borough and   district councils, exceed 3d. in the pound.    Further   consideration is being given to  this matter  with a view to seeing   whether  it would be possible to  guarantee that no loss should   arise.   Politically this would  be a great advantage.6.           While the actual derating of agriculture and industry   will come into force on October  1st 1929 it will not be possible   to operate the block grant system until April 1st 1930.   Provision is made in paragraph 34 for a transitional grant to   cover deficiencies in the intervening half-year.7,          In considering the tables relating to County Boroughs   it must be remembered that these do not take account of charges   due  to  the apportionment of Poor Law charges between the Borough   end  other parts of an existing Union, where the boundaries of   the  Union are not co-terminous with those of the Borough.  This   is explained in paragraph 35, where attention is called to the   anomalous and extremely difficult case of West Ham.   The best   solution would appear to be to convert the County Boroughs of   East and West Ham into Metropolitan Boroughs and the London   County  Council will be consulted about this.8.           It will be observed from paragraph 38 that the  3   millions originally proposed to be provided as new money to   help the scheme through has grown to  7-^ millions.                                            3s.C.th June,  19 8.
^his Docnment is the Property of Hia Britannic Majesty^ Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.            Copy No. 2. Proposals for  Reform in    Local  Government             and in the     FINANCIAL RELATIONSBETWEEN THE  EXCHEQUER AND      LOCAL AUTHORITIES
Proposals for Reform in  Local Government and in the    Financial Relations between the Exchequer and Local    Authorities.   1.  As  the  result of a careful review of the difficulties of pro-ductive  industry the  Government have,  as Local  Authorities are aware, come to the conclusion that the basis of  rating of agricul-tural, industrial and transport properties needs to be revised;  andthey have adopted a plan which they believe will not only place the rating of these  properties on a more rational basis,  but will, morethan any other political action which could be taken, contribute tothe revival  of  agriculture  and the  basic industries.   Their pro-posals were  outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in opening the budget;  and,  as was then indicated, they involve&quot;not only some important changes in the machinery of  local  government,  but aconsiderable modification of the financial relations between the LocalAuthorities and the Exchequer.   In  considering the effect of these changes it must be realised that  the rating relief and the changesin the machinery  and finance of local government are connectedparts  of one single policy.   Legislation will be submitted  to Parliament as early as possiblein the autumn session,  to  give  effect to the administrative,  andfinancial adjustments of local  government;  and  the object of  thismemorandum is to inform Local Authorities in advance and in some detail of the changes proposed  to be embodied in the legislation. &quot; Itis hoped that in this way their full co-operation may be secured andthat as a result of  discussions between their representatives and theGovernment, the legislation may  be framed on practical lines so asto be  of the greatest permanent value to local government.   2.  The first element in the Governments plan is the relief toproductive industry.   The grounds for this proposal have been fullystated in  Parliament, and  the Eating and  Valuation  (Apportion-ment) Bill, which is the first piece of machinery required in connec-tion with  the whole  scheme, is now  before Parliament.  It is not proposed,  therefore,  to recapitulate the grounds for the decision toderate,  or  to  discuss the  details of  the  Eating  and  Valuation(Apportionment) Bill.   But  in  order  that  the  manner in which local Authorities  will be directly affected  by the  relief  given to industrial and  agricultural  property  may be appreciated,  it maybe recalled that the effect of the derating proposals&apos; is that, from the1st October, 1929-   Agricultural  land  and  agricultural  buildings will cease to be      rated.   Industrial hereditaments will be rated on a rateable value which      is to be one-fourth of the net annual value, as defined by the      Eating and Valuation Act, 1925.*   *  In London, one-fourth of  the rateable  value as determined under the valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1809, and the Kating Valuation Act, 1028.

    Freight transport hereditaments  will be rated at  one-fourth of       what they would pay under the existing law.    (It will be remembered that the relief in respect of rates on.       railways is conditional on the equivalent of the reduction in       rates being used to reduce the freight  charges on  certain.       selected classes of goods.) The hereditaments  which are to be the subjects of  derating  are denned in detail  in the Rating and Valuation (Apportionment) Bill,. which- also provides the machinery for the  preparation of a  special list of the values of the properties  to be the subjects of derating, as at 1st October, 1929,  and for  the permanent  rating and valuation provisions which  will  be applicable  to those  properties  after that date.   3.  The  magnitude  of  these rating changes must profoundly affect both the general structure  of local  government and Local Authorities individually.   It is  impossible  to  state with  precision the total loss of rates to Local Authorities  which will be the result of the derating until the preparation  of the special lists to be made under  the Rating and  Valuation  (Apportionment) Bill has  been completed.   The.total for England and Wales may, however,  be estimated in round  figures at   24,000,000 for  the year 1926-27. Obviously, if Local Authorities  are  to suffer  so serious a  loss of rating power, some alternative  source of revenue&apos; must be provided, and  the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer has indicated that  he is prepared, as part of the general scheme,  to find moneys for this. purpose from the Exchequer.   4.  The receipts of Local Authorities from Government  grants in the year 1926-27 (which is the latest year for which  complete figures are  available) were approximately   87,000,000,  while the total of rates collected was   159,500,000. If in that year the relief now proposed had already been given to agricultural, industrial and transport  property, and the proportion of  local expenditure to  be found  under  the  present scheme   from the  Exchequer  had corresponded with the  above estimate of  24,000,000, the relation. between grants and rates would have been        &apos;  Grants   .....&apos;.    ......    111,000,000         Rates     .........      ...    135,500,000 It has seemed to the Government  that so large an increase  in the Exchequer grants in aid of rates necessitates some reconsideration of the grant system, and the more so because  reforms in regard tocertain parts of that system have long  been accepted as necessary.In particular (and especially having  in mind  that the  relief  ofindustry  is a primary  reason  for undertaking a scheme of this magnitude) it has seemed to the Government that no scheme of thekind would be complete unless  consideration  were  given  to thecase of those districts which have been commonly called necessitous-areas.
    5.   If the derating proposals are important in relation to the whole  fabric  of  local government,  they  are no  less so in  their influence on individual Local Authorities.  It must first be remarked that no scheme for providing an alternative  source of revenue for Local Authorities can take the  form of a grant varying from year to year with the  expenditure of individual authorities.  Under such a scheme, the Government would be committed to finding a material proportion of  every Local Authority&apos;s  general expenditure without any possibility of  effective control, and  the financial interest of Local  Authorities   in  their  administration  would  be  seriously impaired.    6.   The most important effect of the derating  proposals on the position of the individual Local Authority is  clearly the narrowing of the basis of taxation available to that Authority, which necessarily involves a greater  or less impairment  of  the capacity to meet the considerable fluctuations in certain classes of  expenditure inevitable from time to time.   This is a matter of less significance in the case of larger Authorities, or of those whose resources are drawn from a wide area, but is of the greatest importance  in the case of smaller and financially  weaker Authorities who  may  be responsible for services  involving  considerable  - expenditure  liable  to  periodic fluctuations between wide limits.    An  examination  of  returns  rendered  by  Local  Authorities indicates that the loss  of  rates in rural areas due to  the derating proposals  will vary  from about 3  per  cent,  to about 57 per  cent. Thus  in the extreme  case  the  reduced assessable value on  which would be charged any future increase in the cost of  the local services would  be  little more than 40 per  cent, of the present assessable value: in other words,  where the Local Authority  at present would- require to meet an increase of expenditure by an additional levy of Is. in the  ,  it would in the  future, in the  absence of  special action, have to levy a rate of 2s. 6d. in the  .    7.   The Government have accordingly come to the  conclusion that the  necessary accompaniments of the  derating schezne are (a) some modification of the basis and method of Government contri- bution to  local services;  (b) arrangements to meet the case of the necessitous areas;  (c) - arrangements to obviate the  difficulties of those  Authorities whose finances are on too narrow a basis.   If the case of necessitous  areas is to be met, a new  method of distributionof Government grants and re-organisation of administrative arrange- ments are both requisite.  Change in the areas or functions of some authorities is the  only way in which a remedy can properly be found for the difficulties of those Authorities whose resources would be inadequate to enable  them to meet their  needs  under the new conditions.    8.   Such a change  must necessarily  proceed  on the basis of widening the area of charge, which is in the line of the developmentof English local  government  for  many generations  and  is  fully    [17804]                                            B  S
 consistent  with  the principles  on  which local. government  is organised.  The services for which there.is a clear case for modifica- tion of this kind are the poor law and highway  administration;  and in both cases it appears to the Government.that the duties should be entrusted to Local Authorities of the first importance, and. that the area of the charge should  be as wide as is compatible with effective local interest in the work to be undertaken. ....                     POOE  LAW  REFORM.    9.   When the parish was found too small to  bear the responsi- bility  for poor  law administration, the burden  was  eased by the creation of the union and the spreading of  the charge over the wider area thus formed.&apos;  To-day, the  union  itself is often in the same position as  that formerly  occupied by the parish, and  in times of stress  is weighed down by an excessive burden, while its neighbour may escape with a  comparatively light  load, though  parts of both areas may be much alike.  These inequalities of rate burden will be. accentuated  by the rating relief which it  is proposed  to give to productive industry, since unions which  are mainly industrial or mainly agricultural will suffer a greater loss than those which are mainly residential, but it is  in the industrial class that unavoidable increases of expenditure are most likely to occur.   An increase in the  need for expenditure,  which might be crippling if it had to be met from the rate and grant resources of  a particular district, may be inconsiderable if spread over a  much wider area.    In revising  the financial relations between  the Exchequer and Local  Authorities,  and in  providing  such additional  Exchequer money as  can  be found for the  purpose,   the Government  aim at mitigating the existing inequalities of rate burden.   That aim cannot be attained within the limits of the Exchequer money  available if distribution is made over areas so small as many of the  existing units of local government, but if the charges for so onerous a service as the  poor law were spread  over the widest possible area compatible &quot;with sound administration, a more equitable sharing of rate burden would  be secured, and such Exchequer assistance  as could be given would  be used to the best advantage.   The Government propose, therefore, that  the responsibility  for poor  law administration shall be transferred  to the  Councils of Counties  and County  Boroughs. They are satisfied  that  the  conditions of  their general scheme of rating relief necessitate this change, and it  appears to them that the change should also be made  on general grounds.   The present Poor Law Unions were set up in 1834, and their size  was regulated, among other things, by reference to the means of access at that time available.   Actually,  the unions were based upon the market towns;  and each  union was made solely responsible for its poor, whether the assistance needed  was medical or financial. The  result is that every  rural union in the country has institutions which, with the decline in rural  areas in the  number of  personsrelieved institutionally, are seldom kept full, and as regards facilitiesfor medical treatment cannot economically be brought up to date.
 Meanwhile, other Authorities charged with the duty both of prevent- ing disease and of treating the sick have been established, with the result that  their functions overlap those of Boards of Guardians. The transfer of the poor law to County and County Borough Councils would eliminate  this  overlapping, would make possible a  better classification of the  sick, and&apos; would  lead to economies  in  the provision of institutional treatment, the general demand for which is everywhere steadily expanding.&quot;   It will be seen that the Government propose to revert to a scheme of Poor Law reform on the lines of that embodied in the Provisional Proposals circulated in January 1926.   In  the later memorandum circulated to the Associations of Local Authorities on the 8th June, 1927, that scheme  was proposed to be  modified to the extent that while all poor law functions were to  be  transferred to County Boroughs, each of which became a single unit  of local government for  all purposes,  only responsibility  for institutional treatment, vagrancy and  the provision of work tests for the able-bodied were to be transferred to the County Councils; the rest  of the poor  law functions and the financial burdens were to remain on the unions, the areas of which were  to be, reconsidered and adapted so as to secure better  units, subject  to  the general condition  that  union boundaries should  in  no  case overlap  county or  county borough boundaries.   The effect of the derating  scheme on the finances of unions, and the strong desire of the Government to mitigate existing inequalities  of rate  burdens, have led the Government to the con- conclusion that the proposals of 1927  will  not  now meet the needs of tlie situation, and it will not escape the attention of Local Authorities that  under those proposals it would be impossible in the  coming negotiations to furnish them with  information as  to the financial position in any area under the Budget scheme, since the areas for poor law purposes would not be settled  for a considerable time.   10.   The main  a^considerations in the existing  law  and practice of poor law administration which arise out of the  transfer  of  the functions of the present  Boards  of Guardians to the Councils of Counties  and County  Boroughs may be outlined as follows :             POOB  LAW  BEFOBM  PROPOSALS.   (i) As from the 1st April,  1930, the functions of the presentpoor law  authorities will be transferred  to the Councils of Counties and County Boroughs.  Each  County and County Borough  will bea complete unit.   (ii) After the passing  of the  Act providing for the  reform ofthe  Poor Law, the  Council of every County and County Boroughwi1! be required to  prepare in anticipation  of the date of the  Actcoming into  operation a  scheme  of the administrative arrange-ments which it will make for the discharge of its new functions.   It is  contemplated that such schemes may include provision    (a) For the delegation of any of the  new functions (apart from         the  power  of raising  a rate or  of  borrowing money)     [17804]                                           B  4
           either to an existing committee of the Council or to a           committee specially constituted for the purpose.    (b)  For the division of the  County area into districts and  for           the  establishment therein  of  local  sub-committees  of           any  committee  (whether   an   existing  or  a  new           committee),  to  which any of the transferred functions           are delegated.    (c)  Subject  to  the maintenance  of  a majority  of  elected           members,  for the  co-option  to any such committee  or           local  sub-committee,  of persons  who  are not members           of  the  Council,  including  persons,  such  as  former           members of poor  law  authorities,  experienced  in the           matters  delegated to the committees or sub-committees,           and members of other Local Authorities.    It will be a definite requirement,  where a  County  or CountyBorough  Council  decides  to provide in its scheme for co-option,that the scheme shall provide for the co-option of women as wellas men.  Provision will be made for the publication of any schemeand for  the  representations  of  Local Authorities and  persons interested to be considered.  Every  scheme  will be subject to theapproval of the Ministry of Health.    It will  be  seen  that  it will  be  open  to  County  or CountyBorough  Councils  to delegate  poor law  functions  transferred  tothem to existing committees :  for example       Where assistance to mothers  and children under five years    of age is required,  the consideration of the application might    be a matter for the Maternity and  Child Welfare Committee    of the  Council.   The education of &quot;Poor Law&quot; children can    also appropriately be dealt  with by the  Education Committee    of the  Council.   The  maintenance of  children  in  institutions    can  be  undertaken by  that  committee,  but the cost will not    attract an education grant from the Exchequer.But it  is intended to give the  widest latitude for the making  ofarrangements suited to local conditions.    (iii)  Where the Council of a County  District is a local educationauthority or an  authority for  maternity and child welfare,  theCounty  Council  will have power, and it is expected that they will normally find it convenient to exercise it, to delegate to the Councilof the County District the local handling of questions relating to theeducation  of  poor law  children and  assistance to  mothers andchildren under the  age of 5  years, subject to such conditions as maybe agreed upon between the two Authorities.    (iv)  Provision will be made  for the transfer of  existing assets and liabilities of poor law authorities, subject to adjustments whichwill safeguard the  interests of  the  ratepayers of the existing unionareas, or when an existing union extends into more than one county or County  Borough, of the divided  parts of the union area.    It is not intended, however, to provide for adjustments for futureburdens.   One main object of  the proposed  transfer of powers  is
that future  burdens shall  be equalised  by enlarging the presentareas of charge.  Any adjustment in respect of future burdens wouldbe quite incompatible with this object.    (v) The area of settlement (or irremovability) of the chargeablepoor will be the County or County Borough in lieu of the Parishor Union.    (vi) Existing Poor Law Officers will be transferred to the new authorities, and proper provision for compensation, where necessary,will be included  in  the Bill.                           LONDON.   The foregoing paragraphs will apply to London, subject to any modifications resulting from the different arrangements in London,for education and  maternity and child welfare.   As a natural  consequence of the transfer of Poor Law functions,the Metropolitan Asylum Board will cease to exist and the LondonCounty Council will become responsible for the services at presentmaintained by the  Board.   The Metropolitan Common Poor fund will also cease  to  exist as the cost  of the relief  of the poor willbe spread over the  County through the County Rate.        REFOBM  IN  HIGHWAY  ADMINISTRATION.   11.  The revolution  in road transport which has taken  place inrecent years has inevitably led to a large expenditure  on highways.Great efforts have been  made by  local authorities throughout thecountry to  improve and maintain  their  roads to  the  standardrequired by modern vehicles,  but the cost  to the authorities, in spiteof the large sums which have been available from the Boad Fund,is undoubtedly a serious burden,  and, further, is  a burden which,under the existing  system, of highway administration, it has  been impossible to distribute equitably as between the various authorities concerned.   When  road  traffic was  horse-drawn,  not only  was the cost ofhighwaj&apos; maintenance much lower, but the great bulk of the traffic,owing to its small  radius of action, was a matter far  more local inits interest and importance than it is to-day.    There has, of course, always been  an  element of through traffic,which was formerly carried on the turnpike roads,  which were thepredecessors of the present main roads.  In 1878 it  was provided bythe Highways and Locomotives (Amendment)  Act that any road which had been  disturnpiked after 1870,  or should be disturnpikedin future, should be deemed to be a  main road, and that  one halfof the cost of maintenance of such roads  should be defrayed out ofthe county rate.  Since the institution of county councils in 1888,main roads have been maintained and repaired  wholly at their cost..By thus  vesting in the largest administrative  units in the systemof local  government,  the  financial   responsibility  of maintainingthrough  communications, the legislature recognised  the principlethat the  smaller authorities should not pay the whole of the  costsoccasioned by traffic which, while passing over.the through roads intheir area,  in  many cases  brought  them  no benefit.    But the
 subsidiary  systems of communications branching  from ,the  trunk roads were used in the days of horse-drawn vehicles almost entirely by purely local traffic, and their maintenance was justly regarded as a proper charge on the urban or rural district in which they were situated.  Urban streets still serve local purposes,almost exclusively, but  the  use  of  rural  highways  has  fundamentally  changed  in-character.   At the present time they form  part  of a large and expanding system of transport of goods by roads in which individual organisations often cover an area of  many counties.  In  addition, the rural areas are penetrated by a large and increasing volume of pleasure  traffic,  which includes a considerable proportion  of  heavy vehicles.   The effect  of these changes &apos;is&apos; accentuated by  the wide differences  which  exist.both in: the  resources  of-individual  rural authorities  and in  the mileage  of  roads&apos;  for which  they  are responsible.   Some rural districts in  which.a penny rate  produces less than.  50, are  responsible  for the upkeep  of important links in the highway system.One district has a quarter of  a mile  of public highway.to maintain,  while others embraee  within their boundaries a considerable mileage of important roads.    12.  In  these  circumstances  it  is  not surprising  that  many rural authorities complain that the  maintenance of. their highways to  an  adequate standard  demands  an  expenditure which  it  is difficult, if not impossible, for them to meet.  In the case of a poor rural authority for instance, the cost&apos; of reconstruction of  one road in order to make it  suitable for carrying a service of motor omnibuses may cause  an appreciable  increase for many years in  the rates, which are,  moreover,  liable to sharp  fluctuations due to necessary periodic works of  highway maintenance.  In many cases  rural authorities are unable to afford an adequate supervisory personnel for their roads or to carry out works of  reconstruction which,  while costly in  themselves, would lead to substantial ultimate economies. These difficulties have  been recognised by the Government and considerable sums  have been  allocated  from the Eoad Fund  for the purpose  of meeting  them,  but the main function of this  fund is the maintenance and improvement of through communications and special assistance from this source for rural authorities can beregarded  only as a palliative.    A solution  which will contain the elements  of  equity and permanence  demands  a  reform in the system of  highway  administration  with  the two-fold  object  of effecting  a  substantial reduction in  the number  of independenthighway authorities and of  distributing the  cost of  maintenance ofthe more important highways over the largest administrative units oflocal government.    13.   The  Government proposals  for certain  redistributions inthe  functions of  local  authorities afford a valuable  opportunity  forsuch a reform, which, urgent as it is in existing circumstances, bothon  grounds of equity and of efficiency,  will  become essential whenthe  resources of rural authorities are  diminished by the  relief ofagriculture from rates.  But the method of assisting the  finances of local authorities by means  of  block  grants,  outlined  elsewhere
 in this Memorandum, is not applicable in its entirety to the upkeep of  highways.   The  arguments  for  increasing  the  measure  of autonomy  of local authorities,  which would  be one of the effects of the block grant system, lose much of their  force when applied to- through  communications,  which  cannot  be regarded as the  sole, or even  in some  cases  the main,  concern of an individual  area oven so large as a single county.  It is accordingly proposed to retain the present system of percentage grants in respect  of  all Class  I and Class II Roads throughout the country except  in regard to the short  sections of such roads in London and  the county boroughs. The Class I and Class II Roads in these large towns are their most important  streets  and  business  centres, and their  proper main- tenance is a matter  of  the greatest local  importance.   On  these grounds there is no reason for excluding the  cost of maintenance andordinary  improvement of these roads  from the scope of the  block grant.  Even in their case, however, works in the  nature of major improvements of Class I and Class II Roads as through communica-tions would continue, to receive  assistance  through special grants from the Road Fund on a percentage basis as heretofore.   14.  The modifications proposed  in the existing  system  ofhighway  administration may be  briefly  summarised  as  follows :      (i) The counties will  assume complete  responsibility for  the            maintenance  of all  roads in rural districts  and  the            substantial  existing  differences in the highway  rates            payable  in  individual  rural  districts in  the  same            county will disappear.    (ii) The responsibility  resting  upon  the  counties  for  the            nraintenance   of   through  communications  will  be            extended by the transference to them of the financial            charges in  respect of all  Class I and Class II Roads            in boroughs  and urban districts outside  the county            boroughs.    (iii) The counties will become highway authorities in respect            of  all  roads  transferred  to  them,  but  consideration            will be given  to the  question  whether certain of the            other  authorities should not carry out  the actual  work            on  their Class I  and  Class  II  Roads   and  other            &quot;main&quot; roads, where  it is  clear that such a course            is  justified  by   considerations   of  efficiency   and            economy.    (iv) Boroughs and  urban district  councils will continue to be            responsible  for the maintenance  of the roads in  their            areas  (mainly  residential  &quot;streets&quot;)  which  are  not            already  maintainable by the county or  which would           not be transferred  to the county  as  classified roads           under paragraph (ii).    (v) County  Boroughs and  metropolitan  boroughs  will retain           their existing responsibility in respect to all the roads           in their areas.
   * The grants in aid of port sanitary iservices and of training of midwivesand health visitors will be continued on the present basis.    (vi)  Where the responsibilities  of existing highway authorities            are  extinguished  a  transference  to  the  county  of            stores,  plant  and other  property- for  the upkeep  of            highways will be  necessary.  Provision will  be made            to protect the  interests of  the  ratepayers  of  such            highway authorities.  .    (vii)  Officers  employed in  connection with the  maintenance of            roads which will be transferred to the counties under            the  new scheme  will;  no doubt, in  the  majority of            cases be required by. the counties.   Proper  provision            for compensation  where necessary will be included in            the Bill.  -             -. :     .   (viii)  The  - financial  aspect  of  these  changes  in  highway            administration  will be  affected both by  the  relief to            be  afforded to  agriculture  and productive  industry,            and  by the modifications, by means of block grants,            in  the methods  of  assisting  the  finances  of  local            authorities outlined elsewhere  in this Memorandum.            Included  for  distribution by  means  of  the &apos;&apos; block            grant&apos;&apos; will be  a contribution  from the Road Fund,            representing             (a) in county areas the  assistance  now  given to the                  maintenance of &apos;&apos; scheduled &apos;&apos;  unclassified roads;            (b) in London and county boroughs  the assistance now          - . -  -    given to the maintenance&apos;and ordinary  improve-                  ment of  Class  I  and  Class II  Roads, usually                  known  as  &quot; classification; grants.&apos;&apos;    (ix)  Assistance through   percentage  grants from the  Road            Fund  will be given  as at  present in respect of  all            Class I and  Class II Roads outside London  and the            county boroughs  and  in respect of  major  improve-            ments to Class  I  and  Class II Roads  within London            and  the  county  boroughs.                   FINANCIAL PROPOSALS.   15.   The  grants from imperial  sources to  local services whichit is proposed to  review in connection with the derating proposals,and the provision of a new source of revenue for Local Authorities,are as follows  :     (i)  Assigned Revenue Grants.    (ii) Grants under the Agricultural Rates Acts,  1896 and 1923.   (iii)  The percentage grants in aid of health services : *              Tuberculosis.              Maternity and  Child Welfare.              Welfare of the Blind.              Venereal Diseases.              Mental Deficiency. .
    (iv) The classification grants for Glass I and Class II roads in          London and County  Boroughs, and the grants for the          maintenance of scheduled roads in County Districts.Exchequer grants other than  the  above-named will not be affectedby the scheme.    16.   The Government propose to widen materially the scope ofthe &quot;Exchequer grants to  make  up the deficiency due. to derating.They have considered how the principles which, in their view, shouldregulate  a proper system of Exchequer grants, can be applied so asto remedy the defects in the existing methods  of payment: -     (i) The assigned revenues are related neither to the  needs nor          even to the expenditure of the Local Authorities;    (ii) The grants under the  Agricultural Bates Acts again are not          related  to  the need  for  public  services,  but  only to          expenditure;    (iii) and (iv)  The percentage grants for health services,  and the          maintenance of roads,  require close supervision by the          Central Department of the work of the Local Authorities          to whom they are paid.  Moreover, as they are not related          closely to needs but to expenditure, their effect is that          those  areas which  are  poorest, and can least afford to          maintain  an adequate  standard,  are just those which          receive the least assistance from national funds.    A system which is complicated  by the payment of grants on suchvarying bases, and which, while requiring particular supervision ofthe services provided by  Local  Authorities on which direct grants are paid, leaves the State with  an unlimited liability under theAgricultural Rates Act, 1923, to pay its proportion of whatever theLocal Authority chooses  to spend,  cannot  be defended.  In theGovernments view a proper system should     (a) recognise that a fair contribution should be made from the          Exchequer towards the  cost of local  services;    (b) ensure  that  Local  Authorities  have  complete   financial          interest in their administration;    (c) be  adapted  in its working  to  the  needs of the  areas  as          indicated by their general characteristics;    (d) permit the  greatest freedom  of  local  administration and          initiative;    (e) provide for  sufficient general control and advice  from the          Central Departments  to ensure a reasonable standard of          performance :    Accordingly, it is proposed to abolish as from the 1st April, 1930,the existing Exchequer grants referred to in paragraph 15.    17.   The portions  of  the  Assigned Revenue Grants at presentapplied   to  education and  police  services,  amounting  to  about 3,800,000,  are, under  present arrangements,  treated as part of
 and deducted  from the  grants which would  otherwise be  payable by the Board of Education  and Home Office in aid of  education and police services, and,  on the abolition of the Assigned Revenues, it is proposed that the  equivalent of the  grants applied to these services should be paid by these Departments out of voted  monies.    18.  The  Local Taxation Licence duties levied by the  councils, of  counties and  county  boroughs which  do not pass through  the&apos; Local  Taxation  Account,* amounting  to  about   1,400,000, will remain leviable by these  authorities and will be retained by  them.    19.  The  loss  to the local authorities under  the scheme will, therefore, be the rates on the rateable value lost under the derating proposals and  the grants specified in paragraph 15,  other than  the parts of the assigned revenues referred to in paragraphs 17  and  18. In  place of the rate and  grant revenue  so lost by local authorities, it is proposed to substitute a new source  of revenue an annual Exchequer grant in aid fixed in total and for each  authority for a period of  5 years,  and revised both in total and for each  authority every five years.    20.   The total sum to be  distributed annually  as the new grant in aid.of revenue  for the first  quinquennial  period will be  made up  of      (i) the estimated loss of rates due to derating which would have          been incurred by all local authorities in the year 1928-29          (taken for the  purposes of the scheme as  &quot; the standard          year &quot;) on the  assumption that the proposed local  govern-          ment changes  had been  in operation in that year, and          that the &quot;Valuation List in force on the 1st October, 1929,          had  been in force in that year;    (ii) the assigned revenue grants payable for the standard year          other than the grants specifically  applied to education          and  police services and the Local Taxation  Licence Duties          not passing through the Local Taxation Account;    (iii) the Agricultural Rates. Acts Grants payable for the standard    . .     year;    (iv) the Health Percentage  Grants payable  for the  standard          year;  .;.......     (v) the classification  grants  for Class  I and Class II roads in      . -   London and county boroughs,  and the maintenance grants          for  scheduled roads in county  districts payable  for the          standard year;    (vi) an  additional sum of new Road Fund and  Exchequer          money amounting to 5 million  pounds for England and          Wales.The actual total sum to be distributed will not be known  until theloss  of rateable  value  has been ascertained  and the  figures forthe standard year are available.  The new money to  be included in  * Licences to deal in game, licences to kill game, licences for dogs, guns^armorial bearings and male servants.
1521 HiW  the grant will, however, not depend in any way on the other figures,   but will be fixed in advance.      21.   It is&apos; proposed that ultimately the whole of the new grant   in aid should be distributed according to a formula based on general   characteristics  independent  of actual expenditure.  In  deciding   what characteristics should be adopted and what weight should be   given to each, the aim has been so  to  adjust the  distribution of   this new revenue as  to make the  assistance vary  with the  need   for local Government  services in any area in relation to the ability   of the area to meet the cost.   After  a careful examination  of a   wide  range of  possible factors,  a  combination of population, the     *    ,  *   proportion^ of children under five and the rateable  value per  head^^*^^^*^5[   of population has been taken as the main framework of the formula. ^^^^-&quot;^-^     To this have been  added, in the  case of the County and County J*   Borough authorities on whom the cost of the onerous highway and   poor law  services will in future fall,  two further factors to allow   for the  considerable  variations  in local burdens  arising  from   unemployment  and the differing density of the  population.   For   the first purpose  the  - proportion of unemployed insured  men  to   total population according  to Ministry of Labour returns has  been   adopted, and  for  the  second, the  population per  mile of public   road as determined by  the Ministry of Transport.     22.  These  factors  are  combined in the proposed formula so as  to arrive at a &quot; weighted population &apos;&apos; for each area,  and, when the  scheme  is  in full operation, the total sum available will  first  be  allotted  to the county  boroughs and the administrative counties at  a uniform rate of X pence per head of weighted population.     Out of the total amount  so allotted to each administrative county,  a  grant  will be made to  each, non-county borough and  urban  district council  equal to its own weighted population multiplied by  one-half of the uniform rate, and to each rural district council equal  to its own weighted population  multiplied by one-eighth  of the  uniform rate.  The aggregate of  the grants to the Borough, urban  and rural district councils will then be  deducted  from the grant  appropriate  to  the  administrative county as a  whole,  and the  balance  will be the grant payable to the county council in aid  of  the general county rate.     23.  Owing,  however, to the very  irregular distribution  of the  existing revenues to be replaced by the  formula  grant, it is  con-  sidered that too great a disturbance in local finance would be  caused  by introducing  the  new scheme of distribution at one step.  It is  accordingly proposed, during the early years of the scheme, to  base  the grant partly on the present distribution of these revenues and  partly on the formula.   For the first quinquennial period the fixed  annual grant will be made up of two parts.   The first part will be  equivalent to 75 per cent, of the loss  of  rates and  grants  in the  standard year calculated  as  explained in paragraphs 30 and 31  below; the second part, which in total will comprise the  equivalent  of 25  per cent, of the loss of  rates and grants  and the whole  of  the new Exchequer money, together  roughly one-third of the whole
grant,  will  be distributed  according  to the  formula.   On each subsequent revision it is proposed that more and more of the totalgrant should be  distributed on formula  until by  1945 the whole would be distributed entirely on this basis.   24.  The full formula proposed is as follows :    (1) For  each  local  authority&apos;s  area  a  figure  of  weighted          population  is  arrived  at by  increasing  the  population          in the standard  year  as  estimated by  the Registrar-          General           (a) by  the  percentage by which,  at  the last Census, the               number  of children  under 5 years  of  age per               1,000  of the population  of the area  exceeded 50,               and          (fe) by  the  percentage  by  which,  according  to the               Valuation List in force on the 1st  October,  1929,               the rateable value per   head  of -estimated  popu-               lation of the area  is below  10.          In the case of the  county councils, the population so          increased is weighted  by  two further factors,  and, in          the case of  county borough   councils,  by the  first  of          these  factors           (c) for  unemployment;  the   number  of  unemployed               insured men is expressed as a percentage  of total               estimated population,  and  where this percentage,               averaged  over  three  years,  exceeds 1^ per cent.,               the   adjusted  population   is   increased   by  a               percentage equal to ten times  the excess;          (d) for low  density of population; where the  estimated               population  per mile  of  roads is  less than 100               persons, by the percentage  by  which the  estimated               population  per mile  of  roads is  less than 200               persons, and, where  the estimated population per               mile  of  roads is  100 persons  or  more,  by the               percentage which 50 persons bears to the  estimated               population per mile of roads.   (2) The  total amount of the  formula grant  to  each  county          borough  and  for each  administrative  county  will be          x pence multiplied by  its  weighted population.    (The          money factor  x pence  will  be determined  by the total          sum  for  England and  Wales  available for distribution          on the formula basis).          As regards  the elements of the formula :           (a) The number  of  children under  5 per  1,000  of the               population  varied  from  48  to 135  at   the last               Census,  and  50  has  been taken  roughly  as the               lowest;
                     17(b) It  is estimated  that, save  in  very few  exceptional      areas,  the reduced  rateable  value per  head  of     population will be less than  10;(c) The  datum figure   (LJ  per cent.)  taken  for  the     unemployment loading  is considerably below  the     average   for  the   country at  the  present time     (2-2  per  cent.),   and  in the  area  of  heaviest     unemployment  the   weighting  factor  on   the     average  of the last  three  years  (excluding  the     period  of the coal  stoppage)  would   amount  to     82 per cent.        The heavy loading proposed for unemployment     of ten times the percentage above the datum figure     is due to  the  fact that in the  first quinquennial     period only about  one-third of the total grant will     be distributed  under the formula.  It  is proposed     that at each quinquennial revision, when a larger     proportion of the  total grant will be  distributed     under the formula, the basis of  the  loading  for     unemployment should  be  revised  in   relation  to     the total  formula  grant.(d) The basis  adopted   for the  density  loading would     result in some  loading  being  applied   in  all     counties  outside  London.   The addition  in the     most  sparsely-populated county  would  amount  to     66  per cent., and in  30 English counties the     addition would exceed 25 nag-cent,--214   25.  For the first quinquennial period grant will be paid direct to each county borough council and county council,  and to eachborough and district council in the county :    (a)  A county  borough council  will receive a grant  equivalent         to 75 per cent, of  the loss of rates  and grants in the         standard  year,  together with  the  formula grant appro-         priate   to  the  weighted  population  of  the  county         borough.   (b)  Each borough and urban district council  within an adminis-         trative  county will receive a  grant equivalent to 75 per         cent, of its loss of rates and grants in the standard year,         together with the formula grant  at the  full rate  on its         own weighted population.   (c)  Each rural district council will receive a  grant equivalent to         75 per cent, of its loss of rates and grants in the standard         year, together with a formula grant at one-quarter of the         full  rate on its weighted population.   (d)  Each county council will, subject to certain minor deductions         referred to in paragraph 32,  receive  a grant equivalent         to 75  per cent, of  its loss of rates  and grants in the         standard  year,  together with  the  formula grant at the         full  rate on the weighted  population  of the county, less         the  aggregate  of  the  formula grants  payable  to the         borough and  district councils  within the county.  The0F PeoPa&amp;sics,,N TH-e. Ft /C&amp;7-
          grant payable  to a.county council will be applied in aid          of the  general county rate,  after deduction  of the part          equivalent to 75 per  cent, of the loss of  special county          rates, which will be applied in aid of the  special county  ,        rate.              .                 -    The foregoing proposals in regard to the distribution of the grantwithin each administrative county have been framed  with special reference to the very considerable changes in the incidence of rateswithin the county involved in the transfer of poor law  and certainhighways to the county  councils.  In the great  majority  of casesrural districts  generally would, on balance, obtain a large  measureof relief from this widening of the area of charge at  the expense ofboroughs and urban district councils, who would not only be requiredto bear their rateable share of the heavy rural  expenditure on roadstransferred to  the county, but  would also remain responsible fortheir own unclassified streets.  The calculation of the grant to the rural districts  at  one-quarter only of the  rate  applicable to urban districts  is considered to provide a reasonable and equitable balance in this matter between urban and rural interests.  The grant payable to borough and district councils under the distribution will ordinarilybe in excess of the actual loss of district rates  due to derating,  andwill be applied by them in aid of the total rates required  to be leviedin their areas.-  At each revision of grant,  when a larger proportionof the total grant will be distributed on a formula basis, the formulagrant to the borough and district councils will  be  calculated at agradually reducing proportion only  of the  full uniform rate until,when the whole grant is distributed on a  formula basis, the grant to the boroughs and urban districts will be at one-half of  the  fulluniform  rate,  and the  grant  to  the  rural districts at one-eighth ofthe full uniform rate, as explained in paragraph 22.    26.   It is also  proposed that in the  case of any county  boroughor administrative  county  (as a whole),  in which  the new grant in aid does not exceed the loss of  rates and grants in the standardyear by  a  sum equivalent to 1/- per head of actual population ofthe area, the new grant shall he increased, by such  a sum as  will bring the net  gain up  to the  equivalent of 1/- per head of  thepopulation.    As regards the borough  and  district  councils   within  theadministrative  county,  it  would, in view  of. the  wide  variation inthe present poundage of  rates in any one  county, be impossible to guarantee that in no area should  there  be any increase  of ratesconsequent  on the introduction  of  the scheme.    Clearly,  withequalisation of certain  charges  throughout  the  county,  some areas will gain and  others will  lose, but it is desired to avoid as far aspossible  extreme  increases of rate  poundage.    It &apos;is, therefore,proposed that  a guarantee should be given, that, if  the calculatedincrease  of rate poundage in  the  standard  year in any county arearesulting from the  scheme as  a whole exceeds 3d., a separate specialgrant should be given to  the area of the money equivalent of the excess.   This special grant will be reduced by l/15th each year sothat it will have entirely disappeared by the time the formula basis
 is applied  to the whole of  the  money available.   For the purpose of  the special  grant  calculations  will  be  made for  each area showing :     (1) the  total rate  which  would  have  been  required for the          expenditure  of the standard year, if  in that year the          scheme had  been in  force and the rate had been  levied          on the basis of the reduced values shown in the Valuation          List  of the 1st October,  1929; and    (2) the total rate which would have been required if in that year          the rate  had been levied on the  basis of the  unreduced          values shown in  the  Valuation List  of the 1st October,          1929, under the arrangements existing prior to the scheme          coming into force.    The rates to which  the  scheme  applies are the rates levied by Eating Authorities only, and  do not include water  rates or land drainage rates.    27.  In the case of a rural district, the general scheme will apply to all rates except  those raised for  purely parochial purposes.   As. regards  the special i-ates,  it  is   proposed  that  for   the first quinquennial  period rural  district  councils  should receive  an Exchequer Grant equivalent bo 75 per cent, of the loss  arising in the standard year from the  derating of certain  of the properties on which  those rates are levied, and that the remaining 25 per cent. shall be paid by the county council.  With a view to providing for the development of the services the cost  of  which is  charged upon special rates, it is also proposed that county councils shall be given a general power to  contribute towards such cost.   28. As regards Joint Boards for Water, Sewerage, Hospitals, &amp;c, it is not  proposed that  any  Exchequer grant should be- paid  to the Boards.  Provision  will be made for a suitable revision of the basis of the contributions of the constituent authorities after October 192960 as to enable the grant payable to the constituent authorities to betaken into  account  in the calculation of the contributions.   29.  The total  annual grant ascertained for  any area  in themanner explained at the inception of the scheme will be fixed for years as from the let April,  1930,  except for any  alterations of area or authority during the period.  If  any such  alterations takeplace,  suitable  adjustments of the  grants  payable  to  the  areasaffected will be  made.   At the end of the first  period  of 5 years the total grant  will be revised and the  grant for each area willbe re-calculated.  The non-formula  part of the grant to  each area,i.e., the part directly proportional to the loss of rates  and grants inthe first standard year, will be reduced by one-third and the formulapart to each area will be increased.   The total formula  grant will then consist of  the total amount  of the previous formula  grant,increased by the total amount taken  horn the  non-formula  grant,and by any new money which may be added.   The allocation ofthe formula grants  to  each area will, of course,  be  made on the particulars of the  area  in a second standard year, probably  1934,the general basis of the formula remaining  unchanged except that
                                                                               \               the unemployment weighting,  as already explained,  will require to               be  revised  in relation  to the total sum  distributed under  the               formula.                   As regards the total sum to be distributed as grant in aid for               the second quinquennial period (apart from  the special grant given               under the guarantee referred  to in  paragraph 26),  it is proposed               that the total  grant in aid  should be increased at least in proportion               to the increase of weighted population.    It is, in any  case, not               intended that there should be  any net reduction  in the total grant               in  aid  to be  distributed  under the scheme however  much the               conditions of  employment  may  have  changed; and  it  is also               proposed  that as  far  as  possible  the ratio of  total &apos; Exchequer               assistance in aid of local government (apart  from the special grant)               to the total rate-borne expenditure of the country at the beginning               of the scheme should at least be maintained, so that if there is any               marked reduction in this ratio at the end of the  first  quinquennial               period not due  to temporary abnormal causes, further Exchequer               money will be added to the total annual sum available for distribu-               tion during the second quinquennial  period  to enable the ratio to               be  restored.    As regards subsequent revisions  of  grant,  similar               arrangements  would apply.   For the  third quinquennial  period               there would be a  further transfer from the non-formula  part of   THfl/X5  of \ the grant to the formula part  and for the fourth period the whole^ c  u urt  \0*     Srant would be distributed on the formula basis.       A i     I -  60.   The  loss ot rates m the&quot; standard year  for  the purpose of  AOJ D&amp;TA* -M f^]ie scheme will be calculated as follows :                    (a) There  will  be  ascertained  the net  rate-borne expenditure                         which would have   been  incurred  by  each  spending                         authority  (county  council,  county   borough  council,                         borough council, urban district council and  rural district                         council) in the year  1928-29,  on the assumption that the                         expenditure  of  the&quot; Guardians  had  been  incurred  by                         county councils  and  county borough councils and that the                         expenditure on  the  highways to  be transferred to the                         county had been incurred by the  county council and not                         by  the borough  and district councils.   Where any union                         is  only partly  within a  county or county borough, the                         expenditure of  the guardians in the standard year will,                         for  the purpose of  this  ascertainment, be  apportioned                         between the parts within and without the county or county               :  - -  &apos;     borough on the basis of the number of persons relieved                         as ascertained at quarterly  intervals during the year.                   (b) The loss  of  rates  in the standard year for each  authority                         will be  such  proportion   of  the  net expenditure  so                         ascertained as the loss of rateable  value due to derating,                         as  shown in the special list of derated properties in the                         Valuation List in force on the  1st October, 1929, bears                         to the total rateable  value which,  apart from the scheme,                         would have stood in the Valuation List.  In the case of                         a county, the aggregates of the  corresponding values in                         the Valuation Lists of all  the rating  authorities in the
          county will be taken for the purpose of ascertaining the          appropriate proportion.    81.  The loss of grants in the standard year will be the actual grants (for which the: new scheme of grants  is to be substituted), payable to each  authority for the year 1928-29, subject  to  the following adjustments :- ;   (1) The Agricultural Eates Acts Grants applicable to expendi-          ture  on the  services to  be transferred to  the  county          will be treated as  grant payable to the county council.   (2) All Health Grants and Eoad Grants payable to authorities          and to voluntary  associations  within  an administrative          county,; will be  treated  as grants, payable to the  county          council.   (3) Health Grants payable to  voluntary associations in  county          boroughs will be treated as grants payable to the  county          borough council.   (4) The grants to voluntary associations in aid of the welfare          of  the  Blind  will be apportioned among county councils          and county borough councils according  to the residence          of  the beneficiaries and treated as grants payable to          these  bodies.   (5) The Tuberculosis Grants to the Welsh National  Memorial          Association will be apportioned among the county council          and  county  borough councils  of  Wales according to          rateable value  and treated  as grants  payable  to  the          councils.  &apos;  &apos; &apos; .   32.  Although all health  grants payable  to authorities  and to voluntary agencies within a county will be treated for  the purposeof ascertaining loss  of  grants under the  scheme  as if they weregrants payable to the county council, it is not intended to interferewith the existing arrangements Under which certain  borough  and district councils  administer  the   Maternity   and  Child Welfareservice  for their area.    It  is proposed that a  scheme for  each county  should be prepared by the Ministry  in consultation  withthe county council showing  the  grants which will be payable bythe Ministry to  the  borough and  district councils  who  continueto administer the Maternity and Child Welfare  service.   Thesegrants will be fixed in amount for five years  and  will  be deducted from  the grant  in  aid. otherwise  payable to the county.    Thescheme will  also show the  basis  of  the necessary  county   rateadjustment  to   be  made  between the  county  council  and  the separate maternity and child welfare districts.    As regards  Maternity and Child  Welfare services carried outby voluntary associations, the county council or county borough council in whose area the associations  function will be responsiblefor the work of  these bodies  and  for the contributions to be madeto them out  of the grant in  aid.   It is proposed  that  each  county and  county  borough  council should  submit for the Minister&apos;approval a statement of the contributions  proposed  to be madeto the voluntary associations in  their  area and  of the conditions
 for securing the efficient administration  of  the  service subject to which the grants will be made.    County Councils  and  county borough  councils will  also  be- required to make contributions to the voluntary associations for the Blind.  It is proposed that these contributions should, as at present,, be made  on a capitation basis  in accordance with  a scheme to be made by  the Minister.    It is  also  proposed  that  the grants. to the Welsh  National Memorial Association should be made by the county  and county borough councils of Wales in accordance with a scheme to  be made by the Minister.    Contributions  by, county  councils  and  borough  and  district councils  in  respect of  medical officers of health  and  sanitary inspectors,  will continue to be made on  the  present  basis,  and, similarly,  county and county  borough councils will be responsible for the payments to public vaccinators hitherto made by boards of guardians.    33.   Any grants under the existing  scheme in respect of  any period prior to the 1st April, 1930, unpaid at that  date, will be paid. The grants payable under the new scheme will be ascertained, so far as- they depend  on local assessments  and rates, from returns which will be furnished by local  authorities  and certified by the district auditors,  and will be paid in 6 instalments during the financial year. It will probably be  necessary  to withhold some  small  part of the grant pending certification,  but the part withheld will not ordinarily exceed the remanet  grant under the  old scheme oustanding on the 1st April,  1930, so  that local authorities  will receive a&apos; full year&apos;s grant revenue  under the new scheme each  year.  The only con- ditions attaching to the grant will be the compliance with the general requirements of the  new scheme and the efficient administration of the local services.  Provision will be made for withholding some part of the grant in  the event of a reasonable standard of efficiency not being maintained.    34.  The new general  grant scheme  will not come into force until  the  1st April,  1930, but  the derating provisions will operate as from the 1st October,  1929.   It will be necessary, therefore, to make transitional arrangements for the compensation of authorities for the loss of rates  in the period the 1st October, 1929, to  the 31st March,  1930.   It is proposed  that every County Council,  county borough   council, borough  and  district  council,  and board  of guardians, should, for that period, receive a grant equivalent to the full loss of rates calculated for the second half of the  standard year. The- calculation  will be made as explained in paragraph 30 above, except that as the local government changes will not have been made there  will be no transfer or apportionment of expenditure  on poor law and highway services.  The grant will be payable in 3 instal-ments during the half-year, and, as there will probably be some delay in the ascertainment of the  grant payable, payment on account willbe made on the  closest estimates available.
    35.   As an illustration of the approximate effect of the scheme, calculations have been made  showing, on certain assumptions what would have been the effect in certain areas if the scheme had been in operation in these areas  in the year 1926-27 :  the  grants to be withdrawn and  the losses  of rates .. are  contrasted  with the new grants under the scheme.    For - the, purpose of this  illustration the loss of rates has been roughly  estimated  from returns  recently furnished  by  Eating Authorities, and  the grants which would have been payable under the scheme have been.calculated on a.money factor of 31-S5d. per head  of weighted population for the year  1926.    It is estimated that the  aggregate of  the  formula  grants for counties  and county boroughs on this basis would amount to nearly  15 million, which is roughly equivalent to 25 per cent,  of the loss of rates and grants, together with  5 million new Exchequer money.    The results of these calculations are shown in the Tables at. the end of this memorandum  for each of the 82 county  boroughs in existence  in 1926-27 and for. 12 of  the  administrative counties. In  the  case of the  administrative counties,  figures are shown of the estimated increase or decrease of the rate poundage which would have  been caused by the -operation  of the  scheme for each of the boroughs and  districts (443  in number) within those counties.,.    The twelve counties have been selected as being typical, and it is believed  that  the  working  of  the  financial  scheme  in counties generally is adequately illustrated by the Tables,.    The illustration is, of course, not intended to do more than give a rough picture  of  the position.   The new Valuation Lists  which, under the Eating and Valuation Act, 1925,  come into force in April, 1928  or April, 1929, may  affect the&apos; calculations  to a considerable extent,  altering,  as  they will, not only the  proportion  which the value  of productive  properties bears to  other properties, but also the rateable  value  per  head  of  population;  and  many . sharp differences in the poundage of the rates levied in the same union for poor law purposes in 1926-27 have  already disappeared under the precepting reforms effected by the Eating and Valuation Act of 1925,while  the fluctuation in the  poundage of the rates levied for countypurposes arising from the difference between the  county rate basis and the poor  rate  valuation list  will  disappear when  the  firstvaluation list under the Act of 1925 comes  into operation.   Further, where  a union  is  situated partly in  one  county  or county borough and partly in another, the rate-borne expenditure has been apportioned, for the purpose of the illustration, between the various parts on the basis of assessable value, and not  on thebasis  which will be adopted when the scheme is in operation.  As already explained,  that  basis will be the number of  persons  in receipt of relief normally resident in or chargeable to each part.    Particulars showing the numbers of persons at present in receipt of relief have, however, been obtained for  12 unions each of whichis situate in more than one county or, county borough and theexpenditure of  these unions for the  year  1926-27  has beenreapportioned  on the basis of these  numbers.   It is found that in
8 cases  (excluding West Ham) this reapportionment standing alone-would have resulted in rate increases in the county boroughs ranging-from l^d. in the   to 1/5-J in the   and in three cases there wouldhave been rate  decreases in the  County Boroughs ranging from2fd. in  the   to 1/2-i in the  .   In 6 of the 8 cases in which there would have been rate increases the net  gain of grant under the  scheme more than counterbalances-the estimated  rate increase.   The  case of the West  Ham Union is quite  exceptional.  If the-expenditure of the Union were apportioned between the  CountyBorough of West Ham,  the County  Borough  of East  Ham  andthe County of Essex according to the number of persons in receiptof relief in each part the  equivalent rates for 1926-27 would havebeen 12/5-^d.  in West Ham, 6/Q\d.  in East Ham  and 5/8%d. inthe part of the Union in the County of  Essex, as compared witha rate of 8/8fd. for the Union as a whole.   Special arrangements will require to be made  to meet  the difficulties  which will arise on the  transfer of the poor law functions to the  County borough of  West   Ham,   and  proposals  for  this  purpose   are underconsideration.   36.  On the assumptions on which the  illustration is  based  itwill be seen that of the 82 county boroughs only five would have lost(two less than.6cL per  head of population, two between 1/- and 2/-and  1 more than 2/-), while 77  would have gained  (6 less  than/- per  head of population;  17  between  1/- and  2/-; 16 between/- and 3/-;  19 between 3/-  and 4/-;  5 between  4/-  and  5/-;.and 14  over 5/-).    As regards the 12 selected counties, in each case the total grantshown for the county as a whole is  in  excess of the loss.   Theillustration shows that the general effect of the  scheme of distribu-tion will be not only to mitigate very considerably the changes inthe incidence  of  rates due  to the widening of  the area of charge-for poor law and highways, but also to reduce the rate poundage inmost districts,. especially  in rural  districts.   The  year 1926-27 is,of course, an unfavourable year  to take for illustrating the work ofany scheme so far as the mining areas are concerned and it may beexpected  that  in  a more  normal year  the  divergencies in  thepoundage of rates would be  considerably less than  those shownin the tables for these areas.                           LONDON.    37.   Certain  modifications  of the financial  scheme will berequired to  meet the special circumstances of London.  Boor  Lawwill be  transferred to the County  Council;  but not  highways.The classification grants  for Class  I and Class  II roads   will,however,, be  discontinued and  their  place taken by the  general grant.    In  view of the  large  measure of rate  equalisation  which  is involved in the local  government changes under the scheme,  itis proposed that the present Equalisation Fund in London shouldbe abolished as from the  1st April,  1930.
The proposals as regards grants are as follows :-   The  County  Council  and  each  borough  council  will receive75 per cent,  of the loss of rates  and grants for the standard year.The County  Council  will receive two-thirds of the formula  grantappropriate to the weighted  population  of the County and  eachBorough  Council will receive  one-third  of  the  formula  grantappropriate to its own weighted  population.   If the  total  grant payable  to  the  County  Council  and  the borough Councils does not exceed the aggregate loss of rates  and grants in the standard year by  a sum equivalent to  1/-  per headof actual  population, the  grant to the  County  Council will  beincreased by such sum as will bring the net aggregate gain  up tothe equivalent of 1/- per head of population.   In the&quot; ascertainment of  the loss of  rates  for  the  standardyear&apos; -   (1) the rates  raised for the purpose  of the Equalisation  Fund         and the grants received from the Fund will be excluded         from the calculations,  and   (2) the highway  and health grants  of the Borough Councils         will not be  treated as grants payable to the County Council         as in the case  of Counties outside  London, but will be         included in Borough  Councils  calculations.  The  grant         in aid  payable to the Borough  Councils ascertained as         explained   will  be in  substitution  for-  all  highway  and         health  grants.   The  proposed   Local   Government   changes   will  involve considerable  alterations in  the incidence  of rates in  London,  andit is proposed that, as in the  case of the Counties outside London,special  Exchequer  assistance should be  given in  aid of  the increases,in rate  poundage.  Where the  increase of rate poundagecalculated  for the standard year in any Borough with a rateable value per  head of population of less than  10 exceeds 3d.  or inany Borough with  a rateable  value  per head  of population of 10 or more exceeds 6d., a special grant of the excess will bepaid.   The special grant will, as in  other cases, be reducible byl/15th each  year.   A Table  is appended showing  the approximate  effect  of  thescheme for the year  1926/27.   38.   It is estimated  that  with  the guarantees  which it isproposed should be given the total additional cost of the scheme tothe Exchequer over  and  above the equivalent of the loss of ratesand grants on the calculations of 1926-27  would amount  to nearly  1\ millions  for  England and Wales, including London.

 against the French view, which may be described as &quot;total tonnage &quot;;  but, while supporting the principle, the United States did not commit themselves for or against the precise classification proposed by us.  Before the adjournment of the Preparatory Commission in March 1927, the French went some way towards meeting the Anglo- American thesis, by agreeing that there should be four classes, as against the nine favoured  by us.  We were unable  to  accept this compromise as  sufficient, the Americans did not commit themselves one way or the other, while the Italians, who had  supported  the  original  French  proposal  for  total  tonnage,   expressed dissatisfaction  with the French compromise.  Under  these  circumstances,  the Preparatory Commission adjourned without accomplishing  anything.     6.  Then,  a few months  later, the Three-Power Conference  was held,  and then, for  the first time,  the British  Admiralty proposed to enlarge the  system of classification by sub-dividing cruisers into  two classes:  (a) Those of 10,000 tons, armed with 8-inch guns;  and  (&amp;). those of 7,500 tons,  or  under, armed with 6-inch guns.  This proposal seems to have surprised the Americans, who opposed it, though not, so far as I can understand, on principle, since it did  not infringe the principle of Parity for which  they were contending.   Indeed, the principle of sub-division of cruisers was accepted conditionally at the Conference both by Admiral Jones in the Technical Committee, and by Mr. Gibson in the final Plenary Session. The ground on which their objections were based  was that our classification of cruisers precluded the 8-inch gun on the smaller type of vessel, while the latter was too small for what they deemed to be their requirements.     7.  So  the matter rested when  the Assembly met in  the autumn of 1927.   In order to avoid having to acknowledge complete failure in the matter of Disarmament, a  Sub-Committee, called the Security  Committee,  was  set up,  the real  though unavowed purpose of which was to put off the evil day.   This Security Committee (which was practically identical with the Preparatory Committee) met last December and again last March, and adopted a series of resolutions, model  treaties, and so forth, which, whether useful or not, have done nothing to assist the Preparatory Commission  towards agreement on  Disarmament.   The  Preparatory Commission itself also met last March, when my instructions were to obtain, if possible, a  further postponement of the whole question. . This  was successfully accomplished  mainly because the French  delegate and myself announced that, conversations had taken place between our two Governments  which might lead  to some arrangement  if time were allowed, for  the purpose.  The Committee was  accordingly adjourned until such time as the Chairman should have reason to believe that it could meet with the prospect of useful results; but while giving this discretion to  the  Chairman,  the Committee expressed the hope  that he would summon the Committee at all eventsbefore the next Assembly, which will  be early in September.     8.  It is important to note what were the conversations referred to in the last paragraph.  They took place in Paris in March between representatives of the Britishand  French  Admiralties, and also (which is more important) between Sir  austen chamberlain and M. Briand in  March and  again  in the  present  month.    Theproposals  which the Foreign Secretary made to M. Briand are set out in column 4,Table A,  of the Admiralty Memorandum (CP. 190 (28)),  and these proposals,  I understand, the French  would be  willing  to accept, only that M. Briand  hasintroduced a further formula for determining cruiser strength based upon the lengthof communications between  the home country and her Colonies  and Dependencies.                         ench desire in order to give them an advantage over Italy,                          unacceptable to  the United  States, since it would  beThis formula, which the Fwould, I think, clearly bentirely at variance with the principle of Parity, and would, I think, therefore be a dangerous one for us either to propose or to support.   The question, therefore, forthe present moment is whether we can persuade the French to accept the classificationcontained in  column 4  of  the Admiralty  table  without reference  to  lines  ofcommunication.    9.  But, at this point, there is another question of very great importance whichis worth  consideration.   In column  6 of the Table  annexed  to the admiralty memorandum are set out &quot; proposals for discussion with the  United States.&quot;   Ifthese  proposals could be put forward, it would be seen how narrow has become thedifference between America and ourselves.  We still propose two classes of cruisers,but the smaller ship is now raised to 8,000 tons, and these smaller vessels may be armed with  8-inch guns.  This would  seem to dispose  of the main objection urged
