[This Document is the Property  of  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]                 Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1928.SECRET.                                                     Copy No.   ^CP. 164  (28).                                CABINET.CONFLICTING  OIL INTERESTS  IN  IRAQ.         MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE  COLONIES.    IN February last I circulated a Memorandum to the Cabinet on the subject ofthe  Trans-Desert Pipe-Line and the projected  Railway from  Baghdad to Haifa.The principal questions  dealt with in the Memorandum were subsequently referredto a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   That Committee hasnot yet reported.  In my Memorandum, however,  I made mention of a question alliedto that of the Trans-Desert Pipe-Line and Railway which at that time seemed to beof secondary importance, namely, the question of the grant by the Iraq Governmentof an extension of the time limit within which, under the terms of their concession,the Turkish Petroleum Company were required to select their plots for development in Iraq before the remainder of the oil-field was thrown open to competitive tender.    In a telegram dated the 8th March, of which a copy was circulated to the Cabinet,the High Commissioner for Iraq was instructed  to recommend the Iraq Governmentto grant to the  Turkish Petroleum  Company a five years&apos;  extension  of the periodmentioned above, subject to two provisos which aimed at securing the early develop-ment on a commercial scale of  the areas  already tested  and the construction of aPipe-Line to the Mediterranean as soon as this was commercially practicable.  Thisrecommendation was  communicated to the Iraq  Government, and  on the 2nd April,the High Commissioner telegraphed that the Iraq  Government  had  agreed to grantan extension of five years subject to the approval of the Iraq Parliament.  The HighCommissioner added  that he was urging the Prime Minister to place the  necessaryBill before the Extraordinary Session of Parliament which was due to&apos; meet after theelections, namely, towards  the middle of May.    I now  circulate for  the information of the  Cabinet a set  of  telegrams  dealingwith the recent  appearance of a powerful new group calling themselves the B.O.D.Company, in which Lord Inverforth is understood to be closely interested.   A copyof a letter received  from this Company stating their aims in Iraq is also appended tothis memorandum^  The  Colonial Office were approached  on  behalf  of this groupearly  in April,  in  the first instance by a Colonel Stanley  who has  recently been concerned in a scheme for agricultural development in Iraq, and later by Admiralof the Fleet Lord Wester Wemyss who is one of the Directors of the B.O.D. Company.The Colonial Office at first experienced considerable  difficulty  in discovering  what were the precise aims of this group.  Enquiries  to this end at first only  elicited thevaguest of replies and the intentions of the group seemed to&apos; be intentionally shroudedin mystery.    It appears  now, however, from the telegrams received from Sir Henry Dobbs,who has had conversations first with Colonel Stanley, who proceeded to Iraq on the16th April, and more recently with  Lord Wester Wemyss,  who has just arrived in baghdad, that  the B.O.D. Company are bent upon obtaining  an oil  concession inIraq either by friendly agreement with the Turkish Petroleum Company or, failingthat,  in  direct  opposition to  that  Company.  It seems clear that, unless  some arrangement between the two Companies can be reached, the intention  of  the B.O.D.Company is to oppose by all means in their power the grant bv the Iraq Governmentof the five years&apos; extension for which the Turkish Petroleum Company have applied                   * From B.O.D. Company, 7th May (with 1st enclosure).      [17705]                                                         B
and which, if  granted, would have the effect of excluding for that period all com-competing oil interests  from the area in  Iraq  over  which that  Company holds  a concession.    In order to enlist the support of the Iraq Government the B.O.D. Company haveexpressed their willingness, if they are granted an oil concession  in Iraq, to proceedwith the  construction  of a  railway from  Baghdad to Haifa without subsidy or financial guarantee from  the Iraq  Government.  As is  apparent from  Sir HenryDobbs&apos;s  reports,  this  inducement has  already  had  the effect  of  persuadingKing Faisal to  withhold his consent from the Bill for  the grant  of  the  TurkishPetroleum Company&apos;s  extension which was to have been submitted to Parliamentduring the present  session.   King  Faisal is  greatly attracted,  as  also are his ministers, with the project  for the construction  of  a railway from  Iraq  to theMediterranean.  This, he feels,  would greatly contribute to the early development and the prosperity of his county.  He is aware that the previous proposal for theconstruction of such a,  railway submitted by Sir A.  Stern and his associates, whichhas been under consideration by the Sub-Committee of the  Committee of ImperialDefence,  was based upon the grant of substantial support from  public funds to whichIraq was expected to contribute very largely.   Not unnaturally, he is attracted bythis new  proposal of the B.O.D.  Company,  who profess  themselves  prepared toproceed with the construction of the railway without financial assistance from theIraq Government, and he feels that it would be opposed to the interests of his countryto grant  the extension to the Turkish Petroleum Company, if  the result would be thatthe B.O.D. Company would withdraw this proposal.  It will be  seen that the HighCommissioner  considers that the agitation  which the  B.O.D.  Company threaten to let loose against the grant of this extension would almost certainly be successful.    Some time ago it was reported to the Colonial Office that Lord Inverforth wasinteresting himself in two sets of claims relating to  alleged oil rights in Iraq.  Thefirst  of  these, held by certain  Turkish nationals,  were based  upon  long-expiredexploration licences in  Iraq and  Nejd obtained from the Turkish Government beforethe war.   The  second set of claims concerns  the heirs of the late Sultan Abdul Hamidand are based upon the alleged  invalidity of the transfer of the  Sultan&apos;s Civil Listproperty to the  State  in  1908 and 1909.    Both sets of claims have been closelyexamined in consultation with other Government Departments concerned, and I am satisfied that they are entirely worthless. This explains the references in the attachedtelegrams to Lord Inverforth&apos;s &quot; claims.&quot;    My colleagues will see from Baghdad telegrams Nos.  277 and 282 that the HighCommissioner  has  suggested as a possible basis  of agreement between the two companies that an arrangement   should  be entered  into whereby  the  TurkishPetroleum Company would  receive their five years&apos; extension, but, before the finalselection by that Company of their  own plots for development, certain agreed plotswould, within  the near future, be  put up for  public auction at  which  the B.O.DCompany could compete.  It appears that this  proposal commends itself to  LordWester Wemyss, to whom it was communicated by the High Commissioner.    I understand that, as a result  of their deliberations, the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence consider it  probable that  a large part of the capitalrequired for the construction of a  railway from Baghdad  to  Haifa would earn nodividend for the first twenty years of that enterprise.  It seems, therefore, that either the B.O.D. Company are prepared to expend  several millions  in order to secure an oil concession  in Iraq, or they are unaware of the above consideration.  It is pro-posed, therefore, to instruct the  High Commissioner to ascertain from Lord  WesterWemyss  whether, in the light of the  above information in  regard  to the financial prospects of a railway  to the Mediterranean, his group still  adhere  to their promise to construct such a railway at their own expense provided  that they secure an oilconcession in Iraq.    The Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence  have throughout been kept  informed of  these recent  developments, and no action has been  taken by theColonial Office except  after  consultation  with the Foreign Office and the Board ofTrade, but, as it seems possible that there may be a serious conflict between theTurkish  Petroleum Company and a powerful rival group, I have thought it right thatthe Cabinet should be informed of the situation.

He did not disclose the name of his  correspondent, and I did not press him to do so.  The situation maj&apos; be delicate in view of the alleged participation of Nuri Pasha.

Following  for Shuckburgh :  Reference  confidential and personal  letter dated18th April.    I had a conversation with Colonel Stanley on April 26th.  Primd facie project for interesting such influential group of capitalists in development of Iraq  and doing away with Inverforth  claims, is most attractive.   Briefly, proposals are, Iunderstand, (a) to apply for oil prospecting concession in old Basra vilayet outsidethe scope of the Turkish petroleum concession; (b)  to arrange with Turkish petroleum company that notwithstanding extension by five years of period for  selection of the24 plots, and for exclusion of other companies, British group  in  question shall,.with Iraq Governments  concurrence,  receive without delay  prospecting rights incertain  areas to be indicated within Turkish  Petroleum  Company area,  but thatperiod of exclusion of other companies shall be maintained.  (It has been hinted bySir J. Cadman that he will seek a further extension of five years.)  (c) That Britishgroup shall interest themselves actively in financing Haifa Railway and acquiringcontrolling interest in existing railways,  (d) That considerable area of agricultural land shall be acquired by them.   Following  preliminary obstacles appear :  Firstly,French  claims  to participation  under San  Remo  Agreement, Article No.  7.  Asregards vilayet of Basra, please  see paragraph 5  (second  sentence) of letter from foreign  Secretary of April  14th,  1926.  N.2244/27/65,  copy  of  which  formedenclosure to your despatch of  April  30th, 1926, Confidential B, and relevant para-graph in letter to Berthelot from Tyrell  of January 20th,  1927, forwarded in yoursecret despatch of March 22nd, 1927.  Statement has been made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that they will not recognise French claim in respect of private  companyother than Turkish Petroleum obtaining oil concession in Basra vilayet,  but has this position ever been accepted by the French sufficiently to make it safe  not to  acquaintBritish  group  with  probable claim?   As   to  areas  outside Turkish Petroleum24 plots within Mosul and  Baghdad vilayets, have French ever  accepted  thesis of      [17705]                                                        B  2
His Majesty&apos;s Government that they have no claim?  Secondly, would not arrange-ment indicated under &apos;(&amp;) above constitute flagrant discrimination in favour of Britishgroup  contrary  to  Anglo-Iraq  Treaty, Article 11 \   Thirdly, would, it not alsoconstitute negation of the open-door policy arrived at in correspondence with Govern-ment of United States of America ?    My excuse for sending this telegram is  that Stanley iseems to be  under  theimpression that a preliminary blessing to the scheme has been given by you, and thathe is at liberty to begin feeling his way with the Iraq Government.  I requested himto keep proposals absolutely secret, and not to mention them to Vernon  or anyoneuntil I have discussed with you certain difficulties which I foresee. I should be glad if you will telegraph as early as possible.   Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner  for Iraq  to the Secretary                            of State for the. Colonies.                            Dated 28th April, 1928.              (Received Colonial Office, 8-15 P.M. 28th April, 1928.)     No: 245 of 28th April.     Private and Confidential for Shuckburgh.     My secret and personal telegram No. 240 of 27th April.  Stanley, with whom Ihave had another talk, has now received regular  power of attorney to  negotiate with iraq Government.  I foresee that if it becomes known here that competition of secondpowerful group is in the field ready to take up immediately areas outside  TurkishPetroleum  24 plots,  the  Government  of Iraq and Iraq  Parliament will  cometo the conclusion that it is in the best interests of Iraq to  refuse the extension of selection period requested  by Turkish Petroleum  Company, and  all chance  ofParliament accepting it will disappear.  Moreover, I feel that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would hardly be justified any longer in giving support to request of  TurkishPetroleum  Company.   The argument put forward by  Ritchie, which had weighedstrongly with me, was that, having regard to the recent large over-production of oil in the world,, hb new  company would, in fact, care to undertake operations in Iraqoutside Turkish Petroleum&apos;s 24  plots  in  the near  future,  because  the countriesserved from Mediterranean Seaboard could not absorb more oil than  that producedfrom these plots, and production of larger amount would consequently necessitatesales at unprofitable rates.  Had this reasoning been correct, Iraq would have sufferedno delay in development by  extension of selection  period.  But, in face  of applicationof new British group, this  argument now fails.  I would suggest that we might be saved from many complications and possible difficulties, both with Iraq and foreign powers, if we now frankly changed our attitude in  regard  to the extension of theTurkish Petroleum period  and informed all concerned that we cannot support theapplication.  One of the reasons for our support  was that  it was understood thatTurkish Petroleum Company could not concentrate  on early extraction of oil and immediate  construction of the pipeline and railway unless they obtained extension.But  this argument also disappears, as I understand that the new group wishes tocontribute  capital  immediately for pipeline and railway.   The  new gushers justopened out simultaneously by Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the neighbourhood ofAhwaz and in transferred territories near Khanikin  are bound to  attract  much attention, and I believe that they have convinced experts that oil can be got anywhere in neighbourhood of the Persian-Iraq frontier.  It will, therefore, be impossible toavoid great publicity  and argument in regard to proposed extension of the selectionperiod.______     Paraphrase Telegram  from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to  the                          High Commissioner for Iraq.

The King and the Prime Minister are deeply concerned with  regard to delay in reaching a decision as to the future of the Railways, which  is causing  economic development  of the country  to be held  up. They have begged me  to make another  effort to obtain decision.  Both  Feisal and the Prime Minister say  (a) they consider  that it is of vital importance that con-struction of railway to  Haifa should be undertaken at an early date, (&amp;) if control of existing Iraq railways  is required by capitalists willing to undertake (a),  they wouldnot oppose such control, provided that reasonable safeguards are made in the interestof Iraq,  that  ultimate  reversionary right of  ownership  of  existing  railwaysremains  with  the Iraq  Government, and that capitalists  obtaining  control  ofexisting railways will undertake to construct an extension of the line from Kirkukto Mosul at the earliest  possible date after control has  been transferred to them.This appears to me to be a notable advance, which may enable His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to  expedite decision both as to general  railway question and as to haifa railway.

I am (? group omitted) Feisal to be cautious, but I anticipate that this letter from Wester Wemyss will have effect of causing the King to suspendgiving his  consent  to  resolution passed by the Council of Ministers recently,authorising Minister of Communications and Works to sign amendments to TurkishPetroleum   Company&apos;s convention  extending  period for  selection  of  plots.Instructions from Secretary of State.are urgently requested.

I understand  from Colonel Stanley that;Lord Wester-Wemyss is due to arrive in Baghdad on 17th May.  After that date itwill be difficult  to keep his proposals from public knowledge.  Danger is that, in event of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government  arriving  at  conclusion  that arrangementsuggested under (&amp;)  in my telegram of 27th April, No. .240, is advisable  and doesnot constitute discrimination,  Iraq Parliament may decline to sanction extensionof T.P.C.&apos;s period for selection of plots owing to reports having got abroad frompremature disclosure of  proposals of Wester-Wemyss that extension of time-limit should be  refused in  the  interests of  Iraq.  It is, therefore, urgently necessary
that I may be informed of His Majesty&apos;s Governments views as to  arrangement under (b)  before Wester-Wemyss reaches Baghdad  in  order that if Parliamentsanction arrangement Wester-Wemyss may not press Iraq  Government to  refuseextension and then find later that it would have been  to the best interest of allconcerned  that extension should have been granted,  and his own  group admittedwhile others were excluded.

They are inclined, as result of their enquiries and as at present advised, to theview that, if construction  of the  Haifa-Baghdad Railway  is to be undertaken,contribution of at least  3,000,000 will have to be made in some form or other from government  sources.  Their  further investigations would be  facilitated  if  theycould be furnished with  some indication as to what way and how far Iraq Govern-ment would be prepared to assist towards  such contribution.

Iraq Govern-ment will  be consulted on  possibility of  contribution, but I  anticipate havingdifficulty in  convincing  them of its necessity  in  view of the definite offer whichit is understood Lord Wester-Wemyss will make on arrival in Baghdad next week,to  undertake construction  of railway  to Haifa immediately, without contribution from Iraq, in return for oil concession.  Copy of statement to foregoing effect, dated28th April, has been shown  to me  by  Colonel  Stanley,  who told  me that statement had been handed to Sir J.  Shuckburgh.   How is it possible for me to meet this argument ?Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.                            Dated 14th May,  1928.              (Received Colonial Office, 12-13 P.M. 14th May, 1928.)    No. 272.    Further to my telegram No. 270 of 12th May. It has occurred to me that Wester-Wemyss group might be regarded as holding exceptional position which would makeit possible for Iraq Government and Turkish Petroleum Company to let them induring five years extended period, while excluding others, without this constitutingdiscrimination.   More or less valid claims against  Iraq Government  and TurkishPetroleum Company are possessed by Wester-Wemyss  group in respect of allegedgrant of oil concessions by Turkey in Turkish Petroleum Company &apos;s area.  Consider-able concern has been caused by these claims, both to Iraq Government and TurkishPetroleum Company.  Abandonment of the claims is now offered by Wester-Wemyssgroup on condition that they are granted immediate right of prospecting and drillingwithin certain portion of Turkish  Petroleum Company&apos;s  area,  from which other interests are excluded.  No other interests, British or foreign, so far  as  is known,hold similar claims, abandonment of which they could offer as consideration for being
admitted to privileged position.  If similar claims were held by other interests, theywould be granted similar privileges by Iraq State and  Turkish Petroleum company in exchange for their abandonment.  Thus there is no discrimination.  Reasoningsomewhat analogous to this was held to apply in the case of Imperial Airways, whenit was held that special privileges granted by Iraq did  not constitute discriminationcontrary to the Treaty, since they were granted in return for special service rendered by Imperial Airways  to Iraq.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.                            Dated 15th May, 1928.              (Received Colonial Office, 3-7 P.M. 15th May, 1928.)    No. 275.  Immediate.    Please refer to my telegram No. 272 of 14th May.  King Feisal and myself wereto-day informed by Prime Minister that he had received in the last mail particularsfrom Ja&apos;far Pasha of the offer from Wester-Wemyss group. He added that he hadnot yet informed his colleagues.  The King and I persuaded him to keep the mattersecret  for the present.   His Majesty remarked, however, that it  will be impossibleto preserve secrecy  after  Wester-Wemyss  reaches Baghdad, and that once thegroup&apos;s offer  becomes  known  all prospect of five years&apos;  extension  for  TurkishPetroleum Company passing through Parliament  will disappear.   I fear, therefore,that unless I receive instructions from you by morning of Thursday, May 17th, wemust make up our minds  to position that Wester-Wemyss group  enter the field  asrivals  instead of co-operators with Turkish Petroleum Company  under  scheme (b)of my telegram No.  240 of 18th April; that  five years&apos; extension to  TurkishPetroleum Company will  not be sanctioned, and  that Wester-Wemyss group  willinsist on  open auction as from March 1930, under Article No. 6, Turkish petroleum company&apos;s Convention, at which they will bid for any plots they desire outside, plotsselected by Turkish Petroleum  Company.   I am not clear whether, in  such circum-stances, offer of Wester-Wemyss group to  construct railway to Haifa immediatelywould  lapse, but as it would form the main consideration to Iraq Government  to induce it not to implement the undertaking to grant five years&apos; extension  to TurkishPetroleum Company, offer Would presumably be maintained.  I have to  leave it  toyou to decide (a) whether this would be regarded as bad breach of faith, (b) whetherit would  be in the best interests of Iraq or not.   You will doubtless remember  thatWester-Wemyss is special personal friend of King Feisal.  He  is to stay  at the&apos;Royal  Palace.   Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High                             Commissioner for Iraq.                       (Sent 9-20 P.M.  16th May, 1928.)     No. 216.  Immediate.     Your telegram No. 262  of 7th May.  It appears  that  position is that whether extension is granted to Turkish Petroleum Company or not, Iraq Government could not, until some date after 14th November this year, and then only as  the result of public auction of plots to be selected by Government not later than i4th March, 1929, grant any further concession for exploitation of oil resources of Iraq except in Basra Vilayet,  and even there only if provision were  made to meet any claims that French Government may hereafter succeed in establishing.  Nor could they  in any case grant prospecting rights to British group, to  exclusion of other  nationalities,&apos; in view of Article  11 of 1922 Treaty.   If extension to Turkish Petroleum Company were refused,  British group  could, when the time arrives, tender for plots  put up to anction in accordance with Article 6 of  Company&apos;s Concession, but they would have to bid in open market and could obtain  lease only of plots  for which they were the highest bidders.  As at present  advised, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not regard.. fact that rival group has appeared as adequate ground for  modifying their attitude1 on question of extension which Turkish  Petroleum Company desire.    The King should accordingly be pressed to approve of revised Articles providing  for proposed extension being submitted to Parliament for  sanction without delay.   At the same time,  you should point out that substantial revenue can only  accrue after construction
of oipe line and  that there is  every reason to believe  that extension of time willexpedite construction of pipe line by allowing Company to concentrate  on provingexistence of sufficient onto justify construction.  It is unlikely that rival group willbuild their own pipeline,  and their advent will retard  rather than hasten  TurkishPetroleum Company&apos;s pipe line by causing energy to be diverted to selection of best&apos;plots for future exploitation. With regard to construction of trans-desert railway,His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are  fully  aware  of  the  importance of the  project.Proposals submitted by Stern are being considered, and, unless and until negotiationswith him prove abortive, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not consider that proposals could properly be entertained  from rival group.  The King  should be informed accordingly.  As regards your telegram No. 222 of 18th April,  you may  make whatuse you think fit of secret papers relating to claims of Hussain Kadri, &amp;c.    As to your telegram No. 272 of 14th May.  Claims  referred to are not regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as being of any substance, and they do not consider,therefore, that course which you suggest could be adopted.  In your telegram No. 275of 15th May,  March 1930  is referred to as date by  which,  in accordance with article  6 of Concession, plots for auction must be selected.  I was not aware thatperiod mentioned in that Article had been extended and have assumed that March1929 still held good.  If my assumption is correct please inform me, as I  understoodthat  only extension so far agreed to was of first period mentioned in Article 5.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.

Telegram dated May 16th  has  beenreceived  by Colonel Stanley from his principals stating that you have instructedme by telegraph to-support their proposals.  This  gives poor idea of honesty of theirprocedure.  I informed Stanley that you have definitely declined to agree to suggestedgrant of rights to British Group to exclusion of other nationalities, as being contraryto Article 11.  I added that I could give no further information at present.   Distinctsuggestion  was made  by Stanley that unless Turkish Petroleum are able to satisfyhis  group  in some  way, latter  will at once engage  in agitation  to  prevent  IraqParliament sanctioning extension of  period.  This, I fear, would be fatally easy.Is it possible to suggest to Turkish Petroleum Company that special agreement shouldbe made  by them with Wester-Wemyss  group, to permit any  plots which they mayselect within  short period from now being put up&apos; to public auction under  Article of Convention, before final selection by Turkish  Petroleum Company of their ownplots, while at the same time Turkish Petroleum Company should receive five years&apos;extension for all remaining area concession.   In my view this  could not be  regardedas discrimination, since auction would be  open to  all nationalities.  It is  mostimportant that rivalry and intrigues between the  two Companies should be  avoided.I am going to have an  audience with the King immediately and will telegraph furtherif necessary.  Wester-Wemyss is due to arrive this evening.    With regard to last part of your telegram, please refer to  paragraph No. 142 ofmy intelligence report 7 of  1927.

In continuation of my telegram No. 277 of  17th May, I have had an audiencewith the King, who says that he cares little about the oil question in comparison withthat of construction of railway to Haifa.  Offer hitherto made by  Wester-Wemyss      [17705]                                                          c
Group was  to construct railway at their own expense in return for exclusive oilconcession.  As His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that exclusive concession is contrary to  treaty obligation,  new group can, therefore, only obtain oil rights overareas desired, by competition at auction.  I do not know as yet whether Wester-Wemyss  Group  will,  on this  changed basis,  maintain their original offer to buildrailway at their own  expense.  If they do, however, it is obviously so advantageous to Iraq that the King considers that Parliament would never consent to TurkishPetroleum Company&apos;s period of selection  being extended,  as  this  would  deferauction for  5 years,  and thus prevent advantage being taken of offer.  His first step will, therefore, be to  ask Wester-Wemyss categorically,  whether, on changedbasis, offer is maintained.  I was unable to move him from this attitude, but I drewhis attention to  fact that Iraq Government can decide nothing as to Haifa railwaywithout  His Majesty&apos;s Governments concurrence.   I also pointed out that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are  directors of Palestine-Trans-Jordan policy, quite apartfrom their right to advise  Iraq.

(Received  Colonial Office, 8-45 P.M.  18th May, 1928.)     No. 282.  Important. .     My telegram No. 280 of 17th May.     Wester-Wemyss had an audience  with  the King to-day, but did not enter into detail with him.   He  learnt,  however, that main point which interests  Iraq is construction of railway to Haifa.  In an interview  with me Wester-Wemyss put the position frankly.  He said that they are prepared to construct the railway,  without any financial contribution or guarantee of  interest or profits from Iraq, in returni for arrangement permitting them to bid for  certain  plots which they desire at public auction at early date.   They would prefer this to be done by friendly arrangement with Turkish Petroleum Company, but if  no other  way can be found  than by opposing grant of 5 years&apos; extension to Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s period, then they must reluctantly  choose this method.   So far as I am  able to  ascertain, they would welcome the arrangement which was suggested  in  my telegram No. 277 of 17th May, and Wester-Wemyss intimated that he would telegraph to his principals advising them  to put it to the T.P.C.  It  was made clear  to him  that I  did not know whether such an  arrangement would have your support.   In best interest of Iraq it appears that some such arrangement  should be made, and so avoid unpleasant conflict between  rival  groups.   Principal  point which emerges is that  offer by Wester-Wemyss group  as to construction of railway seems  to be immensely more favourable both to Iraq and Palestine than any offer  made by  Stern  so far  as I know, and I shall find it very difficult (1)  to press the King to exclude this  offer from consideration on  grounds  that you are still  considering Stern&apos;s  offer, (2) to persuade  the King that  extension  of  T.P.C. period, without giving opportunity (group undecypherable) to Wester-Wemyss group  as now suggested, is advantageous to Iraq if it connotes rejection of this offer regarding railway.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State                               for the Colonies.                            Dated 19th May, 1928.              (Received Colonial Office, 12-18 P.M. 19th May, 1928.)    No. 283.    Please refer to my  telegram  No. 282  of 18th  May.   Wester-Wemyss  was accompanied  here by De Loys,  a Geologist, who formerly served with the TurkishPetroleum Company and was admittedly one of their best employees.  It is allegedby L [1 De Loys] that T.P.C. are not playing quite straight with Iraq Governmentand His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   He  states  that they have absolute knowledge  ofthe location of richest  oil structures already, and could quite easily choose the best24  plots to-morrow, but their difficulty is that it is not possible to make 24 plots
of eight square miles each, to cover whole area of richest structures.   They would need 42 plots for that purpose.   If they choose 24 plots,  the whole or portions ofcertain rich areas would necessarily elude their grasp and would become availablefor immediate exploitation by rivals.  De Loys adds that the aim of the T.P.C.  is,therefore, to obtain five years&apos; extension  now,  and then a further five years, hoping that by the end of that time they will have gained such  a grip on the country thatthey will be in a  position to arrange in some way or other for other interests to be permanently  excluded.   Pretence that  they  are  unable to select the  best  areasimmediately, and to construct pipeline without delay,  is without foundation.    I  thought you ought to know that  these allegations  are being made,  so that(1) you may  consider whether there is likely  to be any  truth in them, and,  if so,whether T.P.C. would deserve less consideration than it has been given hitherto, and(2) you may appreciate how easy it may be for the Wester-Wemyss group to  queerthe pitch here and prejudice Iraq Parliament against  the T.P.C.

Your letter of 4th inst., addressed to Admiral of the Fleet Lord Wester-Wemyss,has been submitted to my Directors, on whose behalf Lord Wester-Wemyss has beenin  communication with Sir John Shuckburgh.    I am instructed by my Directors to approach His Majesty&apos;s Government with aview to  obtaining  their  sympathetic consideration of the  application which ourCompany is making to the Iraq Government for the grant of Concessions for thedevelopment of Oilfields in Iraq, and for the construction of a railway from Baghdadto  the Mediterranean Sea.

The aims of the B.O.D. Co. should therefore not conflict with the legitimate interests of the Turkish Petroleum Co., nor hamper theestablishment in the future of any other Company who might be willing to co-operate in  the complete development of Iraq,  thus safeguarding the principle of the opendoor  policy.    2.   Constitution.- The Company is entirely British, being registered in Londonand consisting entirely of British Shareholders.  Enclosed is a copy of its Memo-randum and Articles of Association.
