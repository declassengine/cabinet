MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF. STATE FOR  AIR.     THE recent operations in Arabia have emphasized the urgency and importance of certain questions connected with the  proper use of air power.  The Chief of the Air  Staff, realising that the  discussion  of these  questions cannot be safely ignored or postponed, has put his views before me in the form of an Air Staff Memorandum. The  paper appears to me of such importance that I make no apology for circulating it to my colleagues.    I  greatly  hope that  they  will carefully read  Sir Hugh Trenchard&apos;s observations and consider the conclusions at which he has arrived.     The use of the Air  Arm has been so successful in the Middle East as to lead us sometimes to forget the essential conditions without which it cannot succeed.  The Chief of the Air  Staff describes these conditions in his memorandum.    He shows  that, with  our  extremely  narrow margin  of  safety,  it is  vitally important that the fullest possible use should be made of&apos;the essential characteristic of air  power,  speed speed in  the matter of  intelligence,  speed  at the beginning and during the course of the operation and speed in the joint effort of the civil and military authorities in  making peace.   My colleagues will see that,  whether  as  a result of a failure to  grasp the potentialities  of  this new  arm or of  a division of authority amongst  several  Departments of State, this essential characteristic  of speed has not been fully exploited in the  recent  operations against the Akhwan or iniiden.  Neither the Chief of the Air Staff nor  I  wish to criticise any  individual or Department.   Our only reasons for circulating the memorandum are  to explain  a situation whose novelty may  have  escaped the notice of my colleagues,  to point tothe dangers  that undoubtedly exist and  to suggest ways and means for avoiding  a crisis in a part of the world where our obligations are unponular and our  urgent need is the avoidance  of further expense.                                                                      S. H.    Air Ministry, May  17,  1928.   -                           AIR STAFF  MEMORANDUM.    The object of this memorandum is  to call attention to certain problems whichhave come into prominence  as a result of the recent air operations carried out in southern Arabia  against the Imam of Yemen and along the south-east frontier ofIraq against the  Akhwan tribes.    In both these theatres,  air operations  have produced situations favourable tothe conduct  of peace negotiations,  but,  whatever may be  the  result  of these negotiations, we have, for reasons which I will explain in this memorandum, undulyprolonged the operations and have come perilously near to a necessity for demandingair or ground reinforcements.    Some of the  problems involved concern the distribution of  political responsi-bilities.   That being so, I feel diffidence in putting forward my suggestions for their      [17682]    ^                           &quot;                      J:--B
solution.  But as the matters are of vital importance if full value is to be obtainedfrom the employment of the Air Arm for carrying out the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the Middle East, I  feel compelled to ventilate the subject before theresults of, and the lessons to be learned from, the recent air operations in the middle east have been forgotten.     Moreover, the  use of air power as an instrument for controlling semi-civilisedcountries is still a recent development and the methods  by  which it operates arenot yet fully  understood by  all who are in one way or another concerned with itsregulation.  It is obviously important that misconceptions should be removed and possible  defects eradicated in the political and military organisations through whichthe use of air power is exercised.     I propose dealing with the subject under the following headings :^          1.  Moral effect of air power.         2.  The necessity for co-operation between the Air Force commander and               the local political authorities.         3.  The importance of &quot;Intelligence.&quot;         4.  The necessity  for  swiftness of decision and  action in  times both of               negotiation and of active operations.         5.  The necessity for unified control in  air defence measures.         6.  The limitations of air power.         7.  Conclusions and recommendations.1.  Moral Effect  of  Air Power.    It is a generally accepted axiom that air power achieves its chief results throughthe moral effect it produces on the enemy, and when employed in backward countries there is the favourable factor that the enemy has little or no air power to counter our action.   This  enhances the moral effect  on the inhabitants,  who find themselvesattacked by a  weapon against which they cannot retaliate.2.  The Necessity for Co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the Local         Political A uthorities.    The proper employment of air  power  is  essentially dependent on  the  mostintimate co-operation  between the Air Force commander and  the  local political authority.   If air operations are to be successful, it is vital that all concerned withtheir conduct, whether civilian administrators  or  officers of the fighting services,should realise  that success is dependent on the effect produced on the  enemy morale.To obtain this moral effect, air forces do not require to  get to  grips with the enemy,nor do they produce tangible and visible results, such as prisoners of war, casualties to our own personnel and definite advances into the enemy&apos;s country.  During activeair operations there are few of the recognised  signs of warfare; there are no longcolumns, no marching and counter-marching, no red  cross ambulances, and none ofthe so-called panoply of war.   Consequently, those who  in  the  past have only been accustomed to fighting on the ground, where nothing can be achieved without gainingactual physical contact with the enemy and defeating him in battle, are not alwaysable to appreciate  the effect that air  action  produces  on the enemy&apos;s  morale andmentality.   In land warfare, the progress of operations is  slow, and it is possible toestimate the result of a particular operation and  to foresee the approaching end when one combatant will surrender or ask for an armistice.   The political authorities havebeen  able to follow the  course of  the operations and are  well aware when the finalscene is set  and it is their turn to enter the arena and to conduct the peace negotia-tions.  In air  warfare, it is not possible to follow the operations  stage by stage, andthat is especially the case when the operations are carried out against a semi-civilisedenemy, and when it is consequently difficult to judge the moral effect of air action onhis mentality.  In this type of warfare it is essential that the Air Officer Commandingand the local  political authority should act together and maintain the closest touchso that the  officer commanding, assisted by the  advice of the political officer and byhis intimate knowledge of the characteristics of the enemy, can keep his finger on thepulse of  the enemy morale and nerves and decide on the most favourable objectives for attack  and can say whether air action should  be continued  or suspended  againstformer objectives  or whether  the bombing should be distributed over a wider area.Unless this close touch is maintained,  the Air Officer Commanding cannot say whenthe  psychological moment has arrived when air operations should be  temporarilysuspended  and  when the political authority should  endeavour to initiate peacenegotiations.
     It is not,  I  think, appreciated that the air arm under these conditions exerts pressure on an enemy in very much the same way  as diplomacy.  The power of the diplomat and of the air arm alike rests on the fact that the  enemy does not know how far we are prepared to go in order to  attain our ends; nor does he know what steps we will take to attain them.  I believe the more local political authorities can be made to realise the close connection between political force and air power, the more they will appreciate the necessity for maintaining close connection with the Air Officer responsible for the conduct of air operations. 3. The Importance of &quot;Intelligence:&quot;     Just as early and accurate information based  on a sound intelligence organisa- tion is essential to political authorities to enable them to achieve  results, so the Air Officer Commanding is dependent on his intelligence service if he is to obtain a quick, economical and humane success.     When land forces are employed for punitive  operations, their movements are probably limited  to the speed of a camel, or of a horse or a man.  If air forces are employed, moving 20 times faster than the older arms, then it is essential that the speed with which  they receive information should be similarly accelerated.  To make the fullest use of air power, an enemy or a disturber of the peace living 200 or 300 miles away from an air force must be made to feel that any act of insurrection or violence will meet with retribution within 12 to  24 hours of its commission.  The offender must not be allowed to feel, as he will if land forces are  employed, that punishment will tarry and that he may be able to use the  interval to evade it.  Even if the case is one in which the political authority decides  that  bombing would not be justified, the air  arm should still be made use of, to enable the political authorities to reach the scene of the trouble and to deal with the matter on the spot within a few hours of its arising.  If full use is made of air communications to speed up the diplomatic  and administrative  action,  much can be done to obviate the  trouble spreading, and a small misdemeanour can be prevented from developing into a rising on a large scale.   This speeding up, however,  is dependent  on a fully organised intelligence system, which did not, and does not, exist in the countries which were the  scene  of  the  recent operations, namely,  in  the  Aden  Protectorate  and  inTransjordan;  while in Iraq,  though the intelligence service is well organised and efficiently run, some additional Arabic-speaking officers are wanted. 4.. The Necessity  for Swiftness of Decision and Action in Times both of Negotiation         and of Active Operations.    Rapidity of action depends not only on  a quick and accurate Intelligence service, but also on  the ability of the man on the spot to initiate offensive air action, or to take such other steps as he may consider necessary, without reference  to  higher authority.  Once  the necessity of taking air action has arisen, any delay in putting it into operation  must inevitably result in unnecessary extension  of the operations, in unnecessary expenditure of material and probably in unnecessary loss of life.    I realise that a decision to  initiate active operations,  whether  from the air or on the ground, inevitably involves  political issues  (a subject to which I will referlater in this memorandum), but it is of the first importance  that the governor  orother supreme local political authority should  be supplied with sufficient powers toenable him to issue orders for air operations to begin without reference to one of thegreat Departments of State at home, unless in very special circumstances.   I  am not, of  course,  suggesting that such political officers should have it  in their powerto start a war of their own initiative;  rather I have in mind an extension of  thefreedom of action already possessed  (e.g.) by the High Commissioner in Iraq in  thecase of  internal unrest, and exercised by him for  years  past,  in  consultation withthe  Air Officer CornTna,TiniTigj with unvarying discretion and  success.  In order  toenable the governor to take such decisions correctly, it is, of course, important thathe should have the confidence of His Majesty&apos;s Government and  that he should bekept fully and regularly informed of the general policy to which his decisions shallconform.    I fully realise that it is impossible to provide governors with instructions whichforesee and cover  every eventuality ; reference to a Department of State at home will,on occasions, be necessary.  But in  such cases it is, in my opinion, essential (pre-suming  that air  forces are the instrument which  will uphold the  policy  of His       [17682]                                                         B  2
 Majesty&apos;s Government) that an immediate reply should be made so as to enable the governor to take instant action.     In the recent operations there have been at least two instances in which, in my view, advantages were lost owing to delays  in coming  to decisions at home.  I cite them not for the purpose of criticising the time taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to reach a decision, but in order to prove that some reorganization is required and to urge that some step should be taken to obviate  similar delays in future.     (a) On the 9th February the Resident, Aden,  reported  that the  Zeidis had captured two friendly Sheikhs, and on the 11th February he telegraphed urging that immediate punitive action should be taken.  Owing to the deliberations of the four Government Departments which were interested in the nature of the answer  to be sent to the Resident, Aden, it was not possible until  the  17th February  to  reply authorising the Resident to take the action suggested by him.  The Resident, having asked for authority to take immediate action, had to wait seven days before he could commence operations.  I suggest that either the Resident should have been already in possession of such full instructions that he would have been able to deal, on his own initiative, with this matter when it  arose, or that, in any event, a reply could and should have been sent to his request within 48 hours of its being received in this country.     (b) The recent air operations on the Iraq  frontier furnish another instance of delay which may have been unavoidable under our present system but which was, in any case,  militarily dangerous.  On the 5th January  the Air Ministry asked for authority to take  immediate air  action against Akhwan raiders who had entered Koweit territory and to establish an  air base in that country should the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq consider that one was required. Correspondence on this subject then passed between the Air Ministry, Colonial Office, India Office and Foreign Office.  The Government of India,  the Resident,  Persian Gulf, and the High Com- missioner in Iraq had also to be consulted, with the result that it was not until the 13th February that the Air Ministry were informed that air action could be taken against the Akhwan in  Koweit, and it  was not until the  15th February that  a decision on the subject of establishing an air base in that country was arrived at.    At any time during the seven weeks that elapsed before a decision was taken onthe Air Ministry&apos;s request, the Akhwan might have raided into Koweit, and in that event the advanced base near  the Koweit frontier from which the  air forces  were operating would have been in serious danger of attack.    But for the success of air operations it is essential that the aircraft should  have room for manoeuvre and so be in a position to locate and attack  an enemy some hoursbefore  he  can possibly reach the base from which they are operating.   If, in the instance cited above, this area of manoeuvre had been  denied to our aircraft, thesituation along the whole of the southern Iraq frontier might easily  have become so serious that not only would the Dhafir have thrown in their lot with Akhwan raiders, as actually happened, but the whole  of the  Anaizah tribe might have gone over toIbn Saud.    Before passing on to my next point, there  is one matter to which I should liketo refer in connection Math the position of local political  authorities.  There appearsto be disinclination on their part, however adequate and comprehensive their previous instructions,  to take responsibility for  initiating air action without referring the matter home to higher authority.   To my mind  it is essential, if local authorities have once been given clear-cut instructions, that  they should then act on their own initiative,  and so avoid unnecessary delay.   For example, in October  1927, the Resident,  Aden, had been authorised to take punitive action against the  Imam in the event of further encroachments.   Nevertheless, when he thought it was possiblethat the Imam and his  followers would  raid  southwards and attack the  town ofLahej, the Resident telegraphed home for further directions to  deal with a  situation which was already fully covered by his instructions. 5. The necessity for Unified Control in Air Defence Measures.    When His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that air power is the recognised weapon for furthering its policy, then it is essential that responsibility for all defence measures within the theatre of operations should rest with the Air Force Commander. Divided control and responsibility not only make it impossible to arrive  at quick decisions, but definitely make it more difficult for air forces to achieve success.     The tribes which look to us for protection in Iraq, Aden, Koweit and elsewhere, are still unaccustomed to the methods by which air power operates, and since  they
 see no large concentrations of troops, no trenches being dug, no wire entanglements being  erected, are fearful that the British Government are not taking action to defend them from their enemies.   It will take some years, even as it has taken some years for the political authorities abroad to familiarise themselves with the working of  the  Air Arm, before  the  tribes  can be made  to  realise  that these visible signs of warfare are not required before air forces operate against  an enemy. Unless the  local Air Officer  Commanding is  the sole  responsible authority for deciding what military action  is to be taken and what forces are required to meet the situation, we should find, as happened in the recent operations on the south-east Iraq  frontier,  that other authorities on  their  own responsibility and without consulting the Air Officer Commanding, would call for other reinforcements, such as infantry, artillery, or for the despatch of His Majesty&apos;s ships.   If these reinforce- ments  materialise within the zone of air  operations, they would inevitably do more harm than good, as their arrival disturbs,  and even alarms, the local inhabitants, who. tend to believe that the situation has got out of hand.    At the present time the air squadrons in the Middle East are thoroughly imbued with belief  in the power of  the air arm  to carry out the work allotted to it.  If, however, they are made to feel that the local political authorities or the Departments of State at home are not confident in the ability of the air to fulfil its role, and that reinforcements  from  other arms  are  imported  in any time of emergency,  their confidence in themselves  to do their work will be impaired, and in any fighting service the next  and inevitable  step to  the loss of self-confidence is a  definite loss of efficiency.    I  do not wish it  to be thought that I am desirous of jealously confining all operations in the Middle East to  air forces, but I  do wish it to be realised&quot; that if the air arm is selected by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the main  instrument of defence, and if it is to be effective  and its  operations are to be  conducted  on the most economical lines, then  it is essential that  unless  and until they are asked for by the Air Officer Commanding and such requests should be few and far between large reinforcements of land forces should not  be sent to the scene  of the operations.  Itis  essential  that the Air Force in  a country  like  Iraq  should realise that the responsibility for preventing enemy raids  and for upholding the integrity of Iraq is theirs and theirs alone, and that His Majesty&apos;s  Government are confident that they will succeed in  successfully  bearing this responsibility.   For  these reasons, it isessential that the Air Officer  Commanding should be  the sole authority for theconduct of operations,  and that it should  be for him to decide what reinforcements,if any, are required to meet any given situation.    During  the recent operations in Iraq, the Resident, Persian Gulf, on more thanone occasion suggested that the Indian Government should hold reinforcements readyto send to Koweit, and that H.M.  Ships should  proceed to that  place to give moral and physical support to the local inhabitants.    It should be appreciated that the  air arm is a delicate weapon which is easilyblunted if misused, either by wielding it too early or too late, and especially too much.How, where, when and in what degree it  is to be employed, are  questions which theAir Officer Commanding on the spot, and he alone, can decide  with  the aid of thelocal political officer and by using his experience in estimating  the effect of the air operations on the morale and mentality of those against whom the  operations arebeing conducted.    Air operations, when carried out against an enemy whose existence is notdependent on a highly organised civilisation, are liable if  unduly protracted to create an attitude of sullen resignation.   Consequently, as soon as there is reason to believethat the morale  of the  enemy is affected by the interference with his normal mode of life, then offensive air action should be temporarily suspended.   An  opportunity is thus created for  the enemy formally or  informally to indicate whether the operations have effected a change in his  attitude.  If that is the case it should be our policy totake immediate  advantages  of this change of heart  to  avoid any  unnecessaryprolongation of  air warfare.   Otherwise, the next stages in active  operations are more difficult, since the enemy will  probably leave his towns and villages and live in the  open or  in caves  (if they are available).   Air operations then become  moredifficult to undertake and require a longer time to achieve results.    In my opinion, the recent  operations at Aden afford an example of the loss ofan opportunity  to make peace with our  enemy shortly  after their  inception.  Tomy mind there is no doubt that the Imam of Yemen and his  people  were preparedto discuss peace terms on the 29th February, although air operations had only been
 carried out a few days.  In proof of this it will be remembered (although we did not. know of this at the time) that a peace emissary who had left the Imam at the end of February arrived within the Aden Protectorate on the 3rd March.  It  will also be remembered that I did  suggest that air operations should be suspended about this time, and that messages should be dropped on the Imam pointing out that, because his tribes had  raided  us, we had counter-raided with 12 aeroplanes, and if he was not  prepared to discuss peace terms, air  operations would be continued.   If this suggestion had been adopted we should have  reminded him that although only 12 aeroplanes had been used, we had many hundreds of aeroplanes elsewhere which could be collected at Aden should he not be prepared to come to some reasonable arrangement with us.  If this policy had been adopted, there is little doubt that the operations against the Imam need not have been continued throughout March.  I am convinced, therefore,  that not only should  the local authority be  allowed  to  decide  how operations should be conducted, but that the Air Force commander should say when operations should be suspended and when overtures for peace should be  made to the enemy.     I have shown  above how the success of air operations is dependent (a) on the ability of the men on the spot to make rapid decisions, and (b) on unified control.  I wish now to indicate how the existing system of administration in the Middle East makes it impossible to fulfil these conditions.     If an operation is to be carried out by a  force from Aden, no decision can be reached until (1) the Foreign Office, (2) the Colonial Office, (3) the India, Office,  and, through them,  (4) the  Government of India, and (5) the Air Ministry have all been consulted and  respectively  expressed  their various opinions.  Immediate  or  early unanimity between  five different Departments cannot be expected,  and it is  only after considerable   correspondence has passed  between them that  agreement is reached.   If  the  operations  concern  Iraq  and  Transjordan, then  again  the (1) Foreign Office, (2)  Colonial Office, and (3)  Air Ministry, are concerned, and, in addition, (4) the High  Commissioner for Iraq or Palestine, and possibly,  also, (5) the Iraq Government, and (6) the High Commissioner for Egypt, will have to be drawn into   the  deliberations.  If,  again,  Persian Gulf  interests  are  involved,  the (1) Resident, Persian  Gulf, (2) Indian Government, (3) India Office, have  ail  to be consulted.     Under  this system much delay  is  unavoidable,  and I  would most earnestly suggest that the number of departmental interests concerned should  be  reduced. Surely it should be possible for the Colonial Office, who are politically responsible for Iraq and Aden, to take over also the responsibility for conducting  our relations with the Trucial Chiefs  and the  Sheikh of Koweit.   In that case, the  Resident, Persian Gulf, might be  placed  under the control of the  High Commissioner for Iraq.     I realise that in putting  forward this suggestion I am entering the sphere of politics.  But my excuse, and, I feel, my justification, is the conviction-based on nearly six  years&apos; experience of the Air Force as the  chief military instrument inthe Middle East that measures are urgently  required to simplify the  administra-tive machinery  in the Middle East and to eliminate interests  in it  which are derived from historical associations  and traditions, but which  do not correspond to  present- day requirements.6.  The Limitations of  Air Power.    The Air Force  became  the primary arm in Iraq in  1922, and  in recent years;additional  responsibilities have been assigned  to it for the defence  of undevelopednations  in the  Middle East.   I welcome  these additional  responsibilities, but itmust be  recognised that these responsibilities can only be met  if  air  forces are permitted to operate in accordance with approved principles.    The Air Arm  is  essentially an  offensive  weapon, and  cam  do  little  towardsdefending a country if its actions are confined to the defensive.   Whenever the airhas  been  allowed   to  operate untramelled,   it has  achieved  success at  smallexpenditure of  life and money in Iraq, in Somaliland, on the north-west  frontier of India,  in Transjordan, and at Aden, but, if in future it is to be confined to a purely defensive role, then it cannot hope to achieve success with economy.    It seems possible that in future political considerations may impose  a defensiverole,  and that our aircraft may be prevented from crossing an enemy&apos;s  frontier in defence of  the territory for  which it is responsible or in pursuit of its enemies.  Ifthis policy  persists,  if we are not allowed to take offensive action, and  if our  aircraft are not given a  sufficiently large area of manoeuvre, then our air forces will be unable
to carry out the tasks which have been allotted to them, and the Air Ministry will be unable to defend these  countries and will have to reconsider the strength and type ofthe forces required for the purpose.    During recent operations  against the Akhwan, no less  than four raids were carried out by the Akhwan into Iraq in the six weeks between the 5th November andthe 17th December, 1927, but during this time air forces were confined to a purelydefensive role and  were forbidden to carry out offensive air operations  across thefrontier.  It was not until the 2nd January that  the High Commissioner for Iraqwas authorised to extend air action into the enemy&apos;s country, since when (a periodof 18 weeks) only two Akhwan raids have been made into Iraq.    When acting on the defensive, air forces could not inflict punishment on theraiders, as, owing to the extent of frontier which had  to be protected,  the enemy was always able to make good his escape after raiding before he could  be  locatedand attacked, but as soon as air forces were permitted to cross the frontier,  they couldfollow  the  enemy across and strike at him  long after he had returned to his ownterritory.   In  this particular connection, I would  call attention to Article 6 of theBahra  Agreements The Air  Ministry  accepted  responsibility for the defence ofIraq, having full knowledge of this particular  Treaty,  but our experience at thattime was limited.   If, in the future, further treaties are made either with  the peopleof Nejd or with other semi-civilised tribes, then I  consider that no clause should beinserted to the effect that, if raiding is  carried out  across the frontier,  air  forces should  be  forbidden to  follow the  raiders  back  into their  own territory  andpunish them.    I would add that it should be most clearly  understood that any limitations onthe tactical freedom of our air squadrons when active operations had  once become necessary which might make it necessary to introduce military reinforcements wouldhave the effect of upsetting the whole financial framework on which our  Middle Eastpolicy is based.    When  it is a case of dealing with an elusive enemy along an open frontier withlong lines of communication to  be  protected, small parties of troops are useless.  Ifreinforcements were to be brought  in at all they would have to be  on a  considerable scale.   When, for example,  the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee considered the possi-biliti.es of expelling the  Imam of Yemen by  a  ground expedition, they  estimated(C.I.D. 738-B, November  1926)  that a complete Division  (less  If  Brigades of artillery) would be required, with 7,000 camels and pack transport, and that thecost of the  expedition would be something between   6,000,000 and  10,000,000.Compare these figures with the actual cost of the recent air operations at Aden,which was   5,000  over and above  the normal maintenance cost of the air squadronthere.7.  Conclusions and Recommendations.    1. (a)  In view of the fact that  air power achieves success by its  effect on the morale of an  enemy, it is  essential that the local  political authority  and the air officer  Commanding should act together in the closest co-operation.   Although it isthe duty of the political authority to determine when air action is necessary, it shouldbe the  duty of the Air Officer to say  when air operations should be suspended andwhen peace negotiations  should be commenced.    (b) Accurate and timely information is essential to the  success of air power.Reorganisation of the intelligence  services in Transjordan, Iraq and Aden appearsnecessary, and additional European personnel capable of speaking the local languagesare required in those countries both in the Air Force and in the Political Departments.    (c) Local  political authorities should be  given wider  discretionary powers sothat they can make decisions  without constant reference to the  Departments  ofState at home.    (d) The responsibilities  of  the  Colonial  Office should be extended to includeKoweit, the Trucial Chiefs and  all political questions concerning the  countriescontiguous  with Arabia.    (e) Would it not be  possible to make one department of the Government, withthe Air Ministry as advisers on  air matters, responsible for political and administra-tive action  in Arabia, or at any rate in Iraq, Aden and Transjordan ?   Even if this                                 * Appendix &quot; A.&quot;
solution is impraticable, has not the time come when the India Office and Govern-ment of India might well consider relieving themselves of their direct political andadministrative responsibilities connected with Arabia?
