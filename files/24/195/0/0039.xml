[This Document is the Property  e  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;! Government]Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1928.Copy  No.  28CABINET.                             DISARMAMENT.        MEMORANDUM BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER.    TO enable my colleagues who have  not  closely followed  the discussions on disarmament to understand the present position of the question, I attempt in thismemorandum to show as briefly as possible  (1) how  the present position has beenreached, and (2) the extent of the difference that now divides us from the Govern-ments of France and the United States respectively.    2.   The starting-point is the Covenant of the League, which, in Article 8, lays it down that &quot; the members  of the League recognise that the maintenance of peacerequires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety &apos;&apos;; and entrusts to the Council the duty to &quot; formulate plans for such reduction  for the consideration and action of the several Governments,&quot;     3.  With a view to giving effect to  this Article, a variety of schemes werepropounded, among them being the notorious Protocol of Geneva, which was rejectedin 1925 mainly through our opposition.  In consequence of this failure, the Assemblyof the League  asked  the  Council to constitute a &quot; Preparatory Commission,&quot;  thepurpose of which was to prepare for a Disarmament Conference a scheme embodying the framework  into  which might be fitted an agreed scheme of reduction ofarmaments all round.     4.  The Preparatory Commission got to  work in March 1927,  when  a  draftconvention was submitted by Lord Cecil of behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, anda second draft  was submitted by the French Government.  These conventions dealtonly with general  principles  on  which disarmament should proceed,  leaving  theactual figures in accordance with those principles to be filled in eventually by theproposed  Disarmament Conference.   It immediately became apparent  that  therewere two main differences between the French and the British Governments.  these differences related  to (a)  reduction  of  land  armaments,  and (b) reduction ofarmaments at sea.     (a.)\ As  regards  land  armaments,  the point  was whether  reservists  whohad  served their   time  with the  Colours  should&apos;  be  included  under the  term&quot; effectives &quot; for the purpose of  reckoning the total strength of Armies to be subjected  to reduction. The French insisted that reservists should not be so included,and that they must  be free to call to the Colours every year their full contingent.  Inthis  they  were supported by most Continental  countries, but the opposite view was maintained by  Great Britain, the United States, Germany, and one or two  other states.  No agreement between these two  views has been  reached up to the presenttime.     (b.) But the chief discussion has raged round naval armaments,  and here also no agreement has been reached, and there is still  a complete deadlock  which threatensthe breakdown of the Preparatory Commission.     5.  This difference of view regarding naval armaments is as follows.   Originally,in March  1927, the French contended that a single figure for the total tonnage of theNavy should be the starting  point for the discussion of any possible  limitation,whereas our view was that a separate figure should be taken for a number of differentclasses of war vessels.  In pursuance of our view,- we put  forward a classificationwhich enumerated nine categories of ships; but it is to  be  noted that at that time we did not propose  that cruisers  should be  sub-divided  into two classes.   the americans supported us on the general principle of limitation by separate categories,       f17815]SECRET.CP. 189 (28).
  by the Americans at the Three-Power Conference, for at the last Plenary Meeting  (pp. 42 and 43 of the Records) Mr.  Gibson said :   &quot;We have agreed to discuss the  principle of 10,000-ton cruisers and to accept a secondary class of cruisers, provided.  that the secondary type of cruisers should not be of a maximum individual displace-  ment which will preclude the mounting of 8-inch guns.&quot;  In a conversation that  took place between the American Admiral Long  and Admiral  Kelly,  the  former  said that they had in mind a vessel of 8,300 tons for the smaller type of cruiser.  If that  is  so, the difference between the  Americans and ourselves  appears to be  narrowed down to a matter of some 300 tons in the size of these  smaller cruisers,  a difference so small that it ought to be capable of adjustment if we felt it  safe to  reopen  the  cruiser question in  any  shape or form.   Personally,  while I fully  appreciate the possible danger of reopening this question before  the Presidential  Election, I do not feel at all sure that if I  were permitted to hold conversation with  the American delegates informally at Geneva it might not lead to useful results.     10.  As for the French, I do not think that the exact classification of cruisers  is regarded by them as of the first importance.   They have accepted the principle  of classification,  and are probably indifferent as to the  exact  limit of  size for  the  smaller type of cruiser; but we know that they also have  had conversations with the  Americans,  and  our information in March was  that they would probably reach  agreement on the lines set out in column 5  of the Admiralty table.  If, therefore, it  were possible for us to come to terms with the United States, it is improbable that  the French would persistently oppose us, especially if we made our  support of their view in regard to land armaments contingent, as we have done up  to now, on their  meeting us on the naval question.     On the other hand, if we arrive at no agreement either with France or the United  States, it is not improbable that they may agree together on terms that will leave us  isolated at Geneva, and saddled with the odium of the breakdown of the Preparatory  Commission.     11.  It is for this reason  that  I  think a point has now  been  reached when  a  decision by the  Cabinet  is  required to   determine what is  to be  the policy of  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  on  this  troublesome  question.   In  a  Memorandum  (P.R.A. (27) 51*) prepared  for Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee, I have  commented onI the attitude of the First Lord of the Admiralty, which amounts to a proposal to  abandon all further attempt to come to agreement on the question of disarmament;  an obiter dictum, to  similar  effect  has been dropped  by the Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer.   The Foreign  Secretary has  indicated the  sort of  repercussion in  Germany that might well be one  of the consequences of  such a policy, and I would  add that it might also have an unfortunate  effect on a considerable volume of opinion  in this country on the eve of the General Election.                                                              nTTQTTTT TVTTVTT ATTreasury Chambers, June 16, 1928.* Circulated to the Cabinet as CP. 191 (28).
