fThi-S Document is  the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.CP. 183  (28).MEMORANDUM BY  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR FOREIGN  AFFAIRS                           ON DISARMAMENT.    I HAVE been unable to do more than give a most hasty examination to theminutes of the Cabinet discussion on the reduction of armaments and the explanatoryletter which Sir Maurice Hankey was good enough to  send me at the same time.    The  Cabinet will  see  from  the  full account  of my  conversation with  M.Paul-Boncour that he and I made no progress, but that, owing to his being as littleprepared to give a decisive answer on any point as I  was myself, the conversationsare merely adjourned and not broken off.  M. Paul-Boncour will either resume themwith Lord Cushendun, when they meet at the Committee on Security, or,  should theoccasion arise, will write to me personally, as I invited him to do, so that tentativeproposals may be made with perfect freedom and be treated as non avenu if  they donot lead to an agreement.    We shall, therefore, have time to consider the matter again after my return, butI venture at once to invite the attention of my colleagues to a matter of the  gravestimportance, which, as far as I could see in the few minutes I have been able to give to the account of the Cabinet proceedings, was not,  I  think, present to their minds.I beg them to consider what lies behind and beyond the statement  made to meyesterday by Herr von Schubert.        Extract from a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs              of a Conversation with Herr von Schubert (June 8, 1928).        .... The second  point to which Herr von Schubert desired to call my    attention was the subject of disarmament.  This matter had been discussed and    adjourned and discussed and adjourned again and again.   On the last occasion    it was said that we must await the results of the French and  German elections.    In the absence of Dr. Stresemann and M. Briand, it was obviously impossible to    discuss it this week, but he wished to draw my serious attention to the fact that    unless some practical result was shortly realised it would be impossible longer to    restrain  German opinion.   He  particularly disclaimed  any  idea  of using    language in the nature of a threat, but failure to make some advance within the    very limited time would make it impossible for the German Government to resist    the conviction which was forming in Germany that the whole pretence of    disarmament was a sham, and that the opening words of the clause in the Treaty    of  Versailles which imposes  disarmament on Germany mean  nothing and that    the basis of the restrictions imposed upon Germany was gone.....         ******    It  will be seen that Herr von Schubert&apos;s preoccupations are the same  as thoseexpressed by M. Paul-Boncour.  Unless we make some progress in the  question of disarmament  we  shall be  faced inevitably by  Germany&apos;s  repudiation  of  thedisarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, with what consequences for theimmediate or future peace of the  world I cannot at this moment pretend to predict.Germany accepted these provisions under duress, and she has more or less respectedthem in the hope  that they were but  the  first step to  a general  limitation  ofarmaments.  The moment that this expectation is definitely falsified she will feelherself  under no moral obligation to observe the  restrictive clauses of the Treaty of***4472  [17788]
Versailles, and no  League, investigation, nothing,  indeed, short of actual violencewill prevent them from becoming practically a dead letter.&apos;  5     If I am right  in  thinking that this aspect of the question was not before mycolleagues in their recent discussions, I am sure that they will appreciate its gravitynow that their attention is called to  it.  In the light of it,  even so important aquestion as naval strength becomes but one part of a much more complicated and far-reaching  problem.   I have  always  thought that the  method  of approach  to disarmament adopted by the League was unfortunate, and that no general conference should have been foreshadowed until  we had assured ourselves privately that real progress was  possible.  Indeed,  in my opinion, it would have, been far.better toproceed from the particular to general limitation  of  armaments than to attemptab initio a universal scheme.   But we are,  as always, in a greater or  less degree,prisoners of past decisions.  If the failure of the conference is not merely laid  at ourdoor but, if as a consequence of  it,  Germany re-arms, the situation  will indeed be serious.     I should have reserved these observations for verbal communication to mycolleagues had it not been for  the  fact that I am  proceeding on a few days&apos;  leavebefore returning home.  In these circumstances, I have thought it better at once tocommunicate my apprehensions to the Cabinet.               ..                                                         A. c.Geneva, June 9, 1928.
