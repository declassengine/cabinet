          UNITED STATES PROPOSALS FOR THE RENUNCIATION                            OF WAR.                     -----------0O0---------          DRAFT REPLY TO THE UNITED  STATES AMBASSADORS                        EOTE OF APRIL 13th.                                           ,vlay         8.               Your Excellency.                    Your note of April 13, containing theThe American   text of a draft treaty for the renunciation  Ambassador               of war together with  copies of the correspon-               dence between the United States and French               Governments on the subject of  this treaty,               has been receiving sympathetic consideration               at the hands of His Majesty1s  Government in               Great Britain.   A note has also been re-               ceived from the French Government, suggest-               ing for consideration certain amendments               to the text of the proposed treaty,  and               the German Government were good enough to               send rne e. copy of the reply which has been               made by them to the proposals of the               United States Government.                    3.   The suggestion for the conclusion  o               a treaty for the renunciation of v/ar as an               instrument of national policy has evoked               widespread interest in this country,  and               His Majesty1s Government will support the               movement to the utmost of  their power.                    3.   After making a careful study; of the               text contained in Your Excellency&apos;s note                                                       and..
-2-and 01 the emended text suggested in theFrench note, His i.:e.jesty&apos;s Government feelconvinced that there is no Berious diver-gence between the effect ol these twodrifts-   This impression is  confirmed &quot;by a study of the text of the speech by theSecretary of State of the United states to which Your Excellency drew my attention and which he delivered before the AmericanSociety of International Law  on April 28th.The aim of the United States  Government asI understand it is to embody  in a treatya broad statement of principle, to proclaimwithout restriction or qualification that war shall not be used as an   instrument ofpolicy.   With this aim His Majesty&apos;6Government are wholly in accord.   TheFrench proposals, equally imbued with thesame purpose, have merely added an indica-tion of certain exceptional circumstances in which the violation ol that principle by one party may oblige the others to take action seeming at first sight to be incon-Eistent with the terms of the proposed pactHis Majesty&apos;s Government appreciate thescruples which have prompted  these sugges-tions by the French Government.   The exactfulfilment of treaty engagements is amatter which affects the national honour;precision as to the scope  of  such engage-ments is,  therefore,  of importance.    Eachol  the amendments suggested by the French                              Government/
Government has been  carefully  considered fromthis point of viev/.   4.   After studying the wording  of  article of the United States draft,  H.M.  government do not  ohink that its terms exclude actionwhich a state may be forced to take in self-defence.   Mr. Kellogg has made it  clear inthe speech to v/hich I have referred above thathe regards the right of  self-defence asinalienable, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed to think that on this question noaddition to the text is  necessary,,   5.   As regards the text of Article  2, no appreciable difference is found between theAmerican and the French  proposals.   K.M.government are, therefore, content  to acceptthe former if as they understand to be  thecase a dispute &quot;among the High ContractingParties&quot; is a phrase wide enough to cover a dispute between any tv/o  of them.   6.   The French note  suggests the additionof an article providing  that violation  of thetreaty by one oi the parties should release the remainder from their obligations under thetreaty towards that party0   H.M. Governmentare net satisfied that,  if the treaty stoodalone,  the addition of  some such provision would not be necessary,,                               Mr. Kellogg&apos;s/
Llr. Kellogg1s speech however shows that he put forward for acceptance the text of theproposed treaty upon the understanding thatviolation of the undertaking by one party would free the remaining parties from theobligation to observe its terms in respectof the treaty-breaking state.     7.  If it is agreed that this is theprinciple which will apply in the case of thisparticular treaty, H.M. Government aresatisfied and will not ask for the insertion of any amendment.  Means can no doubt befound without difficulty of placing this understanding on record in -some appropriatemanner so that it may have equal value&apos;-withthe terms of the treaty itself.     8.  The point is one of importancebecause of its bearing on the treatyengagements by which H.M. Government arealready bound.  The preservation of peacehas been the chief concern of H.M.Governmentand the prime object of all their endeavours.It is the reason why they have given un-grudging support to the League of nations and why they have undertaken the burdenof the guarantee embodied in-the Locarno-treaty.                                     The
p5.9The sole object of all these engagements isthe elimination of war as an instrument ofnational policy, just as it is the purposeof the peace pact now proposed.  It is because the object of both is the same thatthere is no real antagonism between thetreaty engagements which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have already accepted and the pactwhich is now proposed.  The machinery ofthe Covenant and of the Treaty of Locarno,however, go somewhat further than a mererenunciation of war as a policy, in thatthey provide certain sanctions for a breach of their obligations, and these sanctionsmay entail hostilities.  A clash might thus conceivably arise between the existingtreaties and the proposed pact unless it isunderstood that the obligations of the newengagement v/ill cease to operate in respect ofa party which breaks its pledges and adoptshostile measures against one of its co-contractants.     9.  For the Government of this countryrespect for the obligations arising out of theCovenant of the League of Nations and out ofthe Locarno treaties is fundamental.  Ourposition in this regard is identical with thatof the German government as indicated in their note of April 27th.  h.M. Government could not agree to any new treaty which would weaken orundermine these engagements on which the peace of Europe rests.                 , ^  J                                 Indeed
Indeed public interest in this country inthe scrupulous fulfilment of these engagementsis so great that His Majesty&apos;B Governmentwould for their part prefer to see some such provision as article 4 of the French draftembodied in the text of the treaty.  To this we think there can be no objection.  Mr.Kellogg has made it clear in the speech towhich I have drawn attention that he had no intention by the terms of the new treaty of preventing the parties to the Covenant of theLeague or to the Locarno treaty from fulfillingtheir obligations under those instruments.     10.  The language of article 1, as tothe renunciation of war as an instrument ofnational policy, renders it desirable that Ishould remind Your Excellency that there arecertain regions in close proximity to the linesof communication between the different parts cfthe British Empire whose welfare and integrityare necessary to the peace end safety of theEmpire.  Ills Majesty&apos;s Government have been atpains to make it clear in the past that; theycannot suffer interference with these regions.Their protection against external attack is tothe British Empire a measure of self-defence.It must be clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain accept the new treaty upon the distinct understanding that itdoes net prejudice their freedom of action inthis respect.    The Government of the United                                     States . ...
States have strictly analagous  interestsany disregard oi&apos; which by a foreign Powerthey have declared that they would regard as an unfriendly act.   His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment believe, therefore, that in definingtheir position they are expressing theintention and meaning of the U*So government.   11c   As regards the measure of parti cipo-tion in the new treaty before it would comeinto force, H-M. Government agree that itis not necessary to wait until all thenations of the world have signified theirwlllingnoes to be cane parti ec   On theother hand it would be embarrassing if certain states in Europe with whom theproposed participants are already in closetreaty relations were not included aiiongthe parties.   H.Ivi. Government see no.reason, however, to doubtthat these states will gladly accept its terms.   Universa-11ty would in any case be difficult ofattainment and might even be inconvenient,for there are seme states whose governments have not yet been universally recognised,and seme which are scarcely in a positionto ensure the maintenance of good order  aidsecurity within their territories.    Theconditions for the inclusion of such statesamong the parties to the new treaty is  aquestion to which iuroher attention may                                 perhaps/
perhaps be devoted v/ith advantage.   It is,however, a minor question as compared withthe attainment of the more important purpose in view.   120   After this examination of the termsof the proposed treaty and of the points towhich it gives rj.Ee, Your Excellency will realise that H.M. Government find nothing intheir existing commitments which preventstheir hearty co-operation in this new rnove-ment for strengthening the foundations ofpeacew   They will gladly co-operate inthe conclusion of such a pact as is proposed and are ready to engage with the interested governments in the negotiations which arenecessary for the purpose.
