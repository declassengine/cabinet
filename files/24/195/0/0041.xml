COPY NO. x5.  191 (29).p  P.R.A.( 7)  51).             0 A B I  N  3 T.^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S gOVgRWMENT^BRITISH POLICY ON . THE PREPARATORY COMMISSION          &apos;   &quot;FOR DI SARMAiiENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of                Lancaster.     The Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP. 190 (28)) makes it clear in tho final throe para-graphs that the view of tho Admiralty Is that we shouldabandon the attempt to agree to any scheme to be adontedby the preparatory Commission for International disarmament and content ourselves by trying to persuade public opinion by accepting Mr. Kellogg&apos;s draft treaty that althoughunwilling to do anything further in the way of disarmament.by international agreement, we are nevertheless &quot;as muchopposed to war as any other nation&quot;.  I am afraid that acceptance of the treaty for &quot;outlawing war&quot; will onlyintensify the pressure in favour of disarmament, and that Ifwo adopted the line suggested by tho First Lord the onlyeffect would be to cast doubt on our sincerity in signingthe Kellogg treaty.     But apart altogether from that consideration, the policynow advocated by the Admiralty is ono of such importance that the Cabinet should be asked for an early decision as towhether it is or is not trie policy of H.M. Government.  I.do
not deny that there is much to he said for it.  I dislikeas much as anyone the idea of accepting proposals for naval disarmament in the teeth of opposition by the Admiralty;but there Is no use shutting our eyes to the realities of the situation, however disagreeable it may be.  My view&apos;of the situation is correctly quoted by the First Lord inthe second paragraph of his Memorandum.  I do not suggestthat wo should &quot;adopt the policy of admitting that it is always our fault if a settlement is not reached&quot; (p.3), butI do met contend that, however unjustly, we shall in factincur the blame for breaking down the whole movement fordisarmament by international agreement, if we follow theadvice of the First Lord and put an end to the preparatoryCommission, as he. proposes In his final paragraphs.  If theCabinet are prepared to support the Admiralty in thisproposal, it would be desirable to give notice as soon aspossible (a) to the French Government that we are no longerprepared to agree to the scheme which the Foreign secretary with the assent of the Admiralty submitted in writing toM. Briand; and (b) to the Secretariat of the League thatthere is no prospect of H.M.Government being able to give asecond reading to the draft Convention on the agenda of thePreparatory Commission.
