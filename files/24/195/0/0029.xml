[This  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet..  June 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.&apos;CP.  179  (28). CIRCULATED BY DIRECTION OF THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                  BELLIGERENT RIGHTS AT SEA.[A 3215/133/45]       Sir E. Howard to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received May 14.)(No. 860.   Secret.)Sir,                                              Washington, April, 25, 1928.   I HAVE the honour to  acknowledge receipt of your despatch No.  503, Secret,of the 5th April, respecting the future exercise of belligerent rights at sea, informingme that a special sub-committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence had beenappointed to examine this question, and, in particular, to  recommend whether itwould be wise to make an attempt to  reach  an agreement with the United  StatesGovernment with regard to it.  From reading this despatch I gather that there  aretwo main considerations  which we have to  bear  in mind in dealing with thismatter :    First:  What would be the spirit in which the United States Government wouldIK likely to enter into such negotiations, and  whether we could  hope for any  agree-ment that would accord with our view that it is necessary  to maintain belligerentrights, as your despatch says, at as high a level as possible ?   Second: Provided His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to discuss the question atall with the United States  Government, what time would  be  most opportune  for doing so?   2.  Taking the second of these questions first, as being far the easiest to answerdefinitely,  I am entirely  in agreement with  the  view that,  on  account of  the approaching presidential elections, the moment for approaching the United  StatesGovernment is  not an opportune one.  Were it certain that either Mr. Hoover or mr. Dawes would be elected on the 4th November next as President of the UnitedStates, or even that a Republican  candidate  would be elected,  I should not feel sosure that  it would  be advisable to postpone even preparatory discussions for  thepresent.   But as it  seems now within the range of possibility that a Democrat maybe elected, there can be no doubt, in my opinion, that any reference to the question for the moment would be premature.   3.  You will have learnt already from my telegram No. 122 of the 19th Aprilthat there is very little probability of Senator Borah&apos;s resolution in favour of aninternational conference for the recodification of maritime  law being discussed orfoted on in the Senate this session.  It has been referred  to  the Foreign AffairsCommittee after lying for some time on the table of the Senate,  and,  so far as Ican learn, there is no great prospect that that body, which is anxious to adjournas early  as possible, will take it  up,  since  there are so many more immediatelyimportant matters for settlement.   At the same time we must bear in mind thatthere is a considerable body of opinion in this country behind the  demand for acodification of  maritime  law, whether in the form  of  restating old principles ofinternational law or in that of remodelling the old principles  or actually creatinglew ones.   This body of  opinion  is growing,  and  may well before long insist onthe adoption by the Senate of some resolution like  Senator  Borah&apos;s, in which case7e may presume that the United  States Government would be forced to act.  Wettiust thus remember that our hands may be forced  in this matter long before  thefepse of the eighteen months which you mention in paragraph 4 of your despatch.     4468  [17759]
as the period which it. will be necessary  to allow to pass before.. approaching theUnited States Government, supposing no steps to be taken before  he present summ.(vacation begins.   &apos;-.                                        .     , ,     4.   I understand from paragraph 6 of your despatch under reply that, whileHis  Majesty&apos;s Government do not wish to invite or encourage the initiation of such conversations at present, they consider that the very  worst thing that could happenwould be another failure due to insufficient preparation such as occurred last summerat Geneva.  With this view I am, if I may venture to say so, heartily in accord.  it certainly seems to me essential that we should,  before any invitation to a MaritimeLaw Conference is launched by this or any other Government,  endeavour to come toan agreement with the United States Government, at least on main principles, so thatGreat Britain and the United  States, as  the greatest naval Powers, may present a united front.  If we are divided, the continental views will certainly prevail.  Butif the United States and Great Britain stand together, even at the sacrifice of some minor belligerent rights, it is possible that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government may succeed in maintaining belligerent rights at as high a level as possible, or at least in not being left alone to uphold them in the face of a hostile continental combination.     5.   For the above reasons  it seems to me that it  may  well become advisable forus to take up as early as possible the matter quietly, and if need be semi-officially inthe  first instance, as  we did successfully  in  the case  of  claims  arising  out of blockade measures taken during the late war, in order that we may  be prepared todeal with a situation that may be sprung upon us early next year.     6.  I venture, therefore, to think that, if His Majesty&apos;s  Government considerthat it will be too risky to leave this matter indefinitely to chance or until the nextWashington Conference meets in January 1931, it would, be worth while to sound thepresent Republican Administration soon after the presidential elections are decided by the results of the Primaries in September, provided always  either  Mr. Hoover or mr.  Dawes are then elected.  It would, I  think, be very possible to arrange to bringeither  of these  two gentlemen into the conversations, since both sit  in  the presentCabinet.     7.  On the other  hand, should some  other Republican be elected, such asGovernor Lowden or Senator Curtis, this might  be more difficult.  In any case, weshould have to reckon with Senator Borah and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the senate, without whose approval neither Mr. Coolidge nor  Mr. Kellogg would, verywisely, agree to committing themselves on such a  highly delicate and important question.  We should have to make up our minds that the Senate Committee wouldbe consulted, just as it was over the claims settlement, even if any agreement reachedwas  embodied only in an  exchange of notes, which  is what  I should respectfullysuggest,  rather than in  any more formal instrument.  .   ,   .     8.  If, on the other hand,  the Democrats obtain the victory in the presidentialelections, it is obvious that no  discussions could be begun even of the most privatekind until after the presidential inauguration on the 4th March, 1929.     9.  Then everything would depend on who became Secretary of State.  Should,for instance, either Mr. John Davis  or Mr. Frank Polk be appointed Secretary ofState, there is no  reason why we should not at once begin  to approach them if thenconsidered desirable.  Should, however, some perfectly unknown person be appointedto the State Department, such  a course would be impossible unless we are driven toit by circumstances, and it would be better to wait, as suggested  in your despatch,until the autumn of 1929, if then.  We should, indeed, have to be guided in such acase largely by circumstances.     10.  So much for the question of opportunity. I will now endeavour very shortly to deal with the first question mentioned  in your despatch, i.e., the spirit in whichthe United States  Government would be likely to treat the question.     11.  Before starting may I say that I approach this whole question of maritimelaw  in war with extreme diffidence ?   I cannot claim any profound knowledge of thelaw  of nations regulating it.  Such knowledge  as I have is  derived  mainly fromempirical sources of personal experience  during  the war, and  it  may thereforebe that  the  observations  I  make will be found  to be  without  due  foundation,altogether beside the mark and even absurd.     12.  In trying to get  some idea of the American  spirit  towards this question there are one or two fundamental factors which we  must perforce bear constantlyin mind  :       First:  The American mind is likely  to be for a long time to come much more concerned with neutral than with belligerent rights.  This is a traditional attitude
and the members of the Big Navy party, though perfectly aware of the importanceof belligerent rights themselves, have not yet done anything to educate/the countryto an understanding of the interest it has  or may have in the future  in upholdingsuch rights.   On the contrary, they have to a great extent  founded their demands for a big navy on the ground that such a navy is necessary to defend neutral rights,since their argument appeals to many who,  like the late President Wilson and some members of his Cabinet, notably Mr. Daniels, then Secretary of the Navy, would bynature have been most opposed&apos; to a big navy programme and yet supported whole-heartedly that of 1916.   Primd facie therefore we may expect  to find neutral rightschampioned with great ardour by any United States Government and by the ForeignAffairs Committee  of the Senate.                                            -    &apos; ;    Second:  We  must remember that  the old  standards,  on which  internationalmaritime law up to the late war was based, have been completely altered by moderndiscoveries.  It  is useless nowadays even to discuss  a blockade such as that whichwas in the minds of the men who drew up and signed the declaration of Paris. It isnow a commonplace that an &quot; effective blockade &quot; in the neighbourhood of the enemy&apos;scoast has been made &quot;impossible by such modern inventions as the submarine and theaeroplane, and we  must therefore rely on  those arguments  to  show the  americans that if any sort of blockade at all is to be carried on in future against a country whichpossesses such means of defence, it must  be a  &quot;blockade&quot; such as we  institutedduring the late  war, that  is to say at  a, great distance  from  the coast.   This is apoint  which, because it is obvious to anyone having some practical experience andnot merely a legal pundit, we ought, I think, to have little difficulty in persuading the americans to understand.    13.  In order  then to  take the line of least  resistance, it would, I think, be advisable that we should be  prepared to leave the present laws of blockade severelyalone  since they might still be useful in certain cases as,  for instance,  if  we everhad to blockade such countries as,  let  us  say for the sake of example, Egypt orPersia.  It would, however, be most difficult, if not impossible, to get the  UnitedStates Senate and everything depends  ultimately  on that body to agree to extend the present rules of blockade to any really safe distance from the coast.  It is, I think,clear that we should never be able to obtain  acquiescence in the right of a belligerentto confiscate neutral vessels and goods  crossing a blockade line  200 or more milesfrom  the coast of  the blockaded country,  and it would evidently be  most difficultto maintain an  effective blockade at such a distance from  the coast, in the  case ofmany countries on  account of their geographical situation.    14.  This being so I  venture to think that we  might quite frankly allow thepresent rules of blockade to stand for what they may be worth in wars with minorcountries possessing neither submarines nor many aeroplanes.    15.  As regards possible war with  one or more  Great Powers, we should have,it seems to me, to rely on the system instituted by us during the late war of applying the laws of &quot; contraband &quot; and &quot; continuous voyage &quot; without the right of confiscationof neutral vessels or goods, but only the right of &quot; pre-emption.&quot;  This, while almostequally effective, would not be liable to arouse nearly so much opposition  throughoutthe United States as any attempt to extend the existing blockade rules  which permitconfiscation.    16.  The United States are already committed to the  doctrines of continuousvoyage  and  ultimate destination.   They would therefore be  almost  compelled toaccept these.  The law of contraband is also  of course well recognised and is described in a very interesting paper, of which  I enclose a copy, on &quot;Neutral Rights andMaritime  Law,&quot; published by  the Foreign Policy Association of America, in  thefollowing manner : &apos;        &quot;Under  international law, belligerents have the  right to intercept and    prevent certain articles from being  carried to their enemies, even in the absence    of a blockade.  These articles, when destined for the enemy, are called contraband    and are regarded as objectionable in themselves, i.e., capable of warlike use.&quot;    17.  The two  essential elements of contraband are, says  the writer :   (1)  thecharacter  of  the  goods,  (2) an enemy  destination.   The  same  paper states  that&apos;  1 hough neutrals have protested when they considered the lists too all-inclusive,ao rule prevents the belligerent from expanding them at will.&quot;    18.  This being so, it would appear that if we can but reach some agreementI with the United States with regard to the lists of contraband, we might look forward
almost certainly to being able to reach an agreement on this thorny question as awhole........................................     19.  It would, of course, be our aim, always bearing in mind the object in view,i.e.,  of keeping belligerent rights at  as  high a  level  as  possible,  to.  make  the contraband lists as inclusive as  we can so as to embrace, &quot;as a principle, not onlyfinished weapons of  war but also all raw materials from which weapons of war,and machinery, &amp;e,  that can be used to manufacture such  weapons, as well  as allnatural products necessary for motor power, such  as coal, mineral oils and,  above all, lubricating oils, or fats of any kind.   Cotton would, as  always, be a difficulty,but if we could get the principle adopted of having placed on the list any raw products from which materials for use in war could be  manufactured, it would be logicallyimpossible for cotton  to be excluded.     20.  From such  an interpretation of the law of contraband plus the doctrine of continuous voyage, it is but a step to the admission of the necessity  for rationingneutral countries contiguous to the enemy.     21.  How this should be done  I will not attempt to discuss here, but it  mightbe possible to reach an agreement  with the United  States Government on the linesof our blockade measures during  the late war, the responsibility for which was fullyshared by  the  United States authorities after they entered the war.     22.  In conclusion,  I may perhaps be allowed  to emphasise once  more what Ihave already  stated,  that owing not  only to the new  United States fleet, which,however, in my opinion, is really but a minor consideration  in this matter, but alsoand far more to our  financial and economic dependence on  this country in time ofwar, it will be impossible for us in the future  to enforce any blockade measures towhich the  United States does  not agree, without incurring  the practical certainty of defeat in any war we may unhappily be engaged in.     23.  This makes the importance of a previous arrangement in peace time withthe United States on  this matter of maritime law in war almost a necessity from our point of view if we are to maintain in the future our belligerent rights at any levelthat can be useful to us.     24.  I  need only add that if we  postpone this question indefinitely, we may perhaps be faced with a general Maritime Conference, in which we should presumablyfare very badly if we have not the United States on our side, or,  w^orse still, withactual hostilities, in which  case we may take it for  granted that the United States,if neutral, will uphold  neutral rights to the uttermost,  and possibly, nay, almost certainly, succeed in rendering our blockade measures futile because we cannot  afford to defy the United States rulings and so throw the financial and  economic weightof this country into the scale on  the side of the enemy.   Moreover,  it is quite  likely that the nearer the United States Government approach to a  practical  considerationof details the less inclined they wall feel to convoke a general international conferenceon the subject.     25.  Finally, may I say how  grateful I felt to you, Sir, for. allowing Mr. Craigieto come here in order to discuss  this subject with me, and,  so far  as possible, withthe officials of the State Department ?  I think these discussions, of which we informedyou by telegraph, will have done  much to make  the situation  here clear and relievedthe Foreign Office of  any fear there might have been of  the danger  of an immediateMaritime Law Conference.  It was, of course, of the greatest value to me to havethe  advantage of  learning  at first hand from Mr.  Craigie what were the views ofthe different Departments in London on this subject.                                                       I have, &amp;c.                                                            ESME HOWARD.
