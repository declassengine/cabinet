[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government.JPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  May 1928.SECRET.Copy No.    (CCOOVIMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 235th Meeting, held on May 22, 1928.     (Previous Reference, C.I.D. Minutes of the 220th Meeting, Minute 11 (B).)     THE  COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE had under consideration the question of Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s negotiations with Ibn Saud.     MR. AMERY said that  negotiations were held up over the question  of  the dismantling of Busaiyah post.  He thought that this was a question of principle, on which we could not possibly give way.  Busaiyah was 60 to  70 miles from  the frontier, and  could not, therefore, be described  as being &quot; in the vicinity  of  the frontier.&quot;  In point of fact, it was a long way nearer the railway than the River Euphrates.  Efficacy of air action was absolutely dependent on  early  intelligence, for which purpose the maintenance of posts of this sort was essential; and, in  the face of the wanton and entirely gratuitous attack that  had been  delivered upon us, we could not possibly give way on this point.  On the other hand, Ibn Saud himself was  so  placed that he,  too, could not  openly and explicitly  drop his insistence on the  dismantling  of these  posts.  Mr.  Amery  said   that,  in  consultation with the Secretary  of  State  for Foreign Affairs,  he had adopted Sir Gilbert Clayton&apos;s proposal to suspend negotiations, and had given him the necessary  authority.  This had  been  done, and he  understood that an  agreed  statement, of  which he had not yet received a  copy, had beenissued at  Jeddah. In all the circumstances of the case he thought that suspension was the best solution of the problem.  In the first place it would carry us over  the present &quot; raiding season &quot;;  secondly, the tribes  of the Nejd were suffering from locusts and would probably.be in a more reasonable frame of mind next year;  thirdly, and most important of all,  he had been in consultation with  the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs with regard to the early appoint- ment of Sir Gilbert Clayton, who was a friend of Ibn  Saud, to succeed Sir Henry Dobbs, as High Commissioner in Iraq.     SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the Air Staff were most anxious to establish friendly relations with  Ibn  Saud, and to put an end to these embarrassing raids, which were a source of real danger owing to the smallness of our  garrison.  It was because our garrison was so small that he felt that it was impossible to give way as regards the dismantling of Busaiyah and the other essential desert posts.  In the first  place, he  was nervous of the effect which withdrawal on our part  would have on the Akhwan tribes.   These were the most turbulent of any in the neighbourhood, and in November last they had attacked and foully massacred the  whole garrison. If, after the recent successful operations, we gave way to the extent of dismantling the posts, it would be merely an incentive to the Mutairi to start raiding again. Moreover, it was not unlikely that, if we did so, the tribes now in our territory would go over  to the  other  side, and take part in these raids against us.   Secondly, with- drawal on our  part might have serious reactions in Iraq.  There would be a dangernot only of the tribes going over en Hoc to the Wahabis,  but also of political trouble in Baghdad itself.  Lastly, and most important of all, there was  the overwhelming:*(3.)-NEGOTIATIONS  WITH IBN  SAUD.[17706]B
consideration of the safety of our garrison in Iraq.  To ensure this, it was absolutely essential that they should have intelligence of what was going  on on  the other sideof the frontier.  Sir Samuel Hoare emphasized that there was nothing new in thissystem of posts.  They had been used in the North and North-East against the Turksand Kurds,  and  without them it would have  been  quite  impossible  to hold a country of such vast extent with such a small garrison.  If they were done  away with,not only would any further reductions in the garrison be impossible, but an increase&quot;would be essential. In all the circumstances of the case, the only  possible conclusion was to refuse to dismantle the posts in question.    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN  said  that he  realised  the  strength of  thecase that had been put  forward by Mr.  Amery  and Sir Samuel Hoare.  He also recognised that there  was a  certain point  at which political  considerations must give way to the needs of defence.   Nevertheless, he confessed  to considerable anxietyahout our policy in that  part of the world.  We were now at loggerheads with twoChiefs; on the one side,&apos; Ibn Saud, on the  other, the  Imam.  With  the latter wehad been on bad terms for some considerable time because of  his encroachments intothe Aden Protectorate.   Until air forces became available, we had allowed him toremain in occupation  of a portion of our Protectorate because the cost  of turninghim out would have been greater than the advantages to be gained by doing so wouldhave justified.   The Imam  and Ibn  Saud were mutually hostile; and it would be nothing  short of  tragic  if,  as  a  result of the negotiations which  we were nowconducting with each  of  them, we  quarrelled with both, and drove them into eachother&apos;s arms.  In  the past we had put OUT money oh Ibn Saud  and  had maintainedrelatively friendly relations with him; but, recently, we had been forced to undertakebombing operations against his tribes.  There  was this to be remembered,  that Feisalhad a personal  feud with Ibn Saud, who had.destroyed his  father&apos;s throne andturned out his brother;  and there  was therefore the danger of  his using us as astalking-horse to  wreak  his  private vengeance.   In  consequence,  Ibn  Saud wasdoubly suspicious  of us,  and it was therefore most desirable that we should  go asfar as we possibly could in the way of concession.  He did not propose that  weshould abandon Busaiyah, or those other posts which the Secretary of State for Airhad described as absolutely essential for defence  and internal order in Iraq, buthe  thought that we should  really examine what we could afford to  abandon  andthus be in  a position  to make Ibn Saud some tangible  and  appreciable offer.  Itwould be a serious and expensive business if we were to have both Ibn Saud andthe Imam on our hands at the same time.  If Sir Gilbert Clayton were  authorisedto tell Ibn Saud that he  was shortly to be High Commissioner of Iraq, it would do more to reassure him than anything else we could say, short of  a definite and concreteconcession.   To  sum up,  he  felt that he could  not press for abandoning a post that two Secretaries  of State considered  absolutely essential, but he thought  that  wecould  certainly try to make our proposals as attractive as possible, first, by indicatingvery definitely that we were not going to fortify any wells except those which wereabsolutely necessary,  and, secondly,  by  letting Ibn Saud know that  his  friend,Sir Gilbert Clayton, was  shortly to be  High Commissioner in Iraq.    LORD BIRKENHEAD  said  that he  had been  in communication with  sir austen Chamberlain on this question, in view of the effect which  these negotiations might  have  upon  the  Moslem population in  India,  and also  in Egypt.   It wasimpossible to deal  with questions affecting the Iraq border in the same way as one would deal with the border between France and Germany, or Canada and the UnitedStates.   Operations against Ibn Saud, he was advised, would be of a  formidablecharacter, and the last yard  of the road of conciliation ought to be trodden before weresorted to such action.  He was doubtful whether Ibn Saud  was the  master of  hisown destiny in this matter, and that wTas an additional reason for not treating him with undue severity.    MR. AMERY said  that  there was no  question at  the  moment  of  operations against Ibn Saud.  All that had happened up to the present was a series of aggressiveraids  a long way into Iraq by tribes under the control of Ibn  Saud,  and these  raids were likely to continue whatever happened, either under Ibn Saud  or his successor.    LORD BIRKENHEAD intervened to enquire whether  Mr.  Amery  consideredthat Ibn Saud had sufficient control to stop these  raids.
    MR. AMERY replied that he could not stop them altogether;  but whether hecould or could not do so, our real security lay in the Air Force being able to do its work.  He felt that the best solution to the problem lay in patience.  Ibn Saud had got himself into a position from which it  was impossible to withdraw, and it wasnecessary to give  both him and Sir Gilbert Clayton time to find a way out of - theirmpasse.  Feisal and ourselves  had been victims of unwarranted aggression, and wewould not be helping the situation on either side of the frontier if we gave way.  a firm attitude always paid  in the East.  It was true, of course,  that we might have both the Imam and Ibn Saud on our hands, but there could be no question of a coalition as between civilised nations, nor of combination between these two.  In fact,there would be nothing with which the existing Air forces in Iraq,  Transjordaniaand Palestine, on the one side, and in Aden, on the other, could not cope.    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that for his part he was.quite ready toexercise patience; but patience, accompanied by bombs, was not a policy with whichhe could agree.  There was no doubt that the present agreement on the  subject ofwells and water supply in  the neighbourhood of the  frontier was loosely drawn, andthat Ibn Saud was  stretching  the point too far when he interpreted a distance of70 miles as being &quot; in the neighbourhood of the frontier.&quot; It was to be  remembered,however, that  this frontier question could not be handled in  the  same  way as a frontier between civilised  nations; and  that the tribes were migratory.  He urgedthat the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry should do  all they could, either to pacifyIbn Saud, or to meet him half  way.  Earnest efforts should be made to find materialconcessions, and to limit  our  demands  to what was absolutely essential  for our security and policy.    SIR  HUGH TRENCHARD said that he agreed with the Foreign secretary that it was  of vital importance to establish peaceful  relations with Ibn Saud.  Theseraids  were no new thing.   There had been 10 in  the years  1924-26,  and  4  in 1927.To deal successfully with these  raids, it was essential that we should have posts whichcould give information of  them in good time.  But there was no question of havingthem along the whole  thousand miles of  frontier.  All that was required were three or four posts at a distance of some 60 miles from the  frontier.  The closest of them was 30 miles and no complaint  had even been made to this post.   He asked if it wouldnot be possible to explain implicitly to Ibn Saud that we must maintain a few posts,and that Sir Gilbert Clayton, who was going to be High Commissioner in Iraq, would settle with him at a later date exactly which posts were necessary.  He was in favourof taking any conciliatory action that was possible; and he had always advocated thatthe tribes should  be paid  rents for their landing grounds.  But the Treasury had found themselves  unable to agree.    LORD BIRKENHEAD said that he was in agreement with the spirit underlying the views expressed by the Chief of the Air Staff.  He thought that Ibn Saud shouldbe informed as soon as possible of the fact that Sir Gilbert Clayton was to succeedSir Henry  Dobbs, that the King should be consulted at once, and that the decision should be communicated to Sir  Henry Dobbs.         i    MR. AMERY said that he had been in correspondence with Sir Henry Dobbs,who had expected, and wished, to remain in his present appointment until June 1929.Ibn Saud and Sir Gilbert Clayton had now separated for two or three weeks; and bythe end of that time it ought to be possible to put Sir Gilbert Clayton in a position toinform Ibn Saud of the Governments intentions.     SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN  thought that  instructions should be sent toSir Gilbert Clayton as soon as possible, and that it should be left to his  discretion asto when and how he should use the information.  In  addition,  he thought  that theAir Ministry  should  examine the question of what posts were absolutely essentialfrom  the point of view of  defence, and that Sir Gilbert  Clayton should be put in aposition to make an offer, which would convince Ibn  Saud that we were doing our best to meet him.  He  enquired, first, what were the means of communication betweenthe posts and Air Force Headquarters, and, secondly, whether a system of &quot; Watchand ward &quot; by air patrol  could not be used to replace  some of these posts.     SIR&apos; HUGH TRENCHARD replied that there was  wireless  communication between the posts and Headquarters at Baghdad.  As regards the suggestion of sub-stituting air patrols  for  these posts,  this system had proved to be practicallyvalueless.[17706]
    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN referred to the following telegram which had just been received from Sir Gilbert Clayton on the subject of the consignment  ofammunition for Ibn Saud,  which was held up at Port  Sudan :-          &quot; Question of ammunition detained at Port Sudan has not been raised  by    Ibn Saud, but early decision regarding it is essential.  Conditions of off-loading    at Port Sudan are such as to make it impossible to ensure secrecy of embargo, and    knowledge of it will have an adverse effect upon Ibn Saud and may also cause    him  to place future orders  in other countries.   From the  point of view  of    suspension of conversations with Ibn Saud,  I can only recommend immediate    release and acceptance as inevitable of any risk  there  may be  of it  being    eventually used in hostilities against Iraq.  I  can,  however, offer no Reasonable    security&apos; such as is requested in your telegram No. 18, and I am in no position    to appreciate importance of criticism which might be aroused in  Iraq and    at home.&quot;&apos;    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that it was a most difficult  problem.  Adecision to hold up the ammunition would pro tanto destroy Ibn Saud&apos;s confidence inhis power to get munitions  from this country, and would merely result in his placinghis orders elsewhere.  Moreover, Sir Gilbert Clayton obviously felt that the detention of this ammunition would have a damaging effect  on the negotiations which he was now conducting.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that,  on the whole,  he would be inclined to takethe risk and release the ammunition.    LORD BIRKENHEAD remarked that this question would have to be reservedfor the Cabinet.    MR.  AMERY thought that it would help to shorten the Cabinefs discussion ifthe views expressed at  the Committee of Imperial Defence could be placed beforethem.  He, for  his  part, thought we  ought to take  the risk and  release  the ammunition.    SIR HUGH TREN-CHARD observed that, from  the Air  Force point of view,there would naturally be some uneasiness at the release of ammunition which mightbe  used  against themselves.  But  he  had  been  in  consultation with  the localauthorities, and he could assure the Committee that no unduly  adverse effects wouldresult.    SIR  CLAUD JACOB was definitely in favour of  releasing the  ammunition.If we were the only source  of supply it would, of course,  be a different matter, since we would be in  a position  to bargain.   But, as it was, Ibn Saud could always getwhat he wanted from elsewhere.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE remarked that the risk of release lay in the fact thatthe tribes would probably get this ammunition out of Ibn Saud.    SIR  GEORGE MILNEft  said  that he was not conversant with this question and was not in a position to express an opinion.                               CONCLUSIONS.THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed to recommend to the Cabinet (a.) That the maintenance of Busaiyah and certain other desert posts is essential      for the effective defence  of Iraq  by the  existing garrison,  and  that,      therefore,  it is impossible  to  give way to Ibn  Saud on  the  principle      involved in this question.(&amp;.) That, subject to  (a) above,  it is  most important that Sir Gilbert Clayton      should be put in a position to make  an offer which will convince  Ibn  Saud      that we are doing our best to meet him in this matter.  With this object,      the Air Ministry should examine the whole question of frontier posts with      a view to determining which  are  absolutely  essential, and  which, if      any,  could be  dispensed  with.  In presenting our case to Ibn Saud,      emphasis should be laid on the  moderation of our demands, for example,      in respect to the small number of  posts in comparison with the very  large      length of frontier.
(d.) That, subject to the King&apos;s consent, and after the necessary formalities have   .   been  completed,  Sir Gilbert Clayton  should be authorised to inform      Ibn Saud  that he,  himself,  is  to  succeed  Sir  Henry Dobbs  as  High      Commissioner  of Iraq in  due  course.    This authority  should   be      communicated to Sir Gilbert Clayton with the least possible delay, and it      should be left to his discretion as to when, and  how, he should use  the      information.id.) That, with regard to the consignment of ammunition for Ibn Saud which is      detained at&apos;Port Sudan, it is, on the whole, advisable to accept the risk      involved and release the ammunition.*           *          *           *           *    .       *                                 V2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,        May&apos;22, 1928.
