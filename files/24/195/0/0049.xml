THE INDIAff STATUTORY  COMMISSION.     The aocompanying copy of  a Note  with  regard to thefirst visit, of the Indian Statutory Commission to IndiaIras been communicated by Sir John Simon for circulation to the Cabinet in accordance with Cabinet  %9 (i38),Conclusion 9, of May 17th, 19 28.                      (Signed) M.p.A.HANKEY,                         Secretary to the  Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.   June 80-Bt,  1923.
                                                            o h, 13     There is no doubt that the boycott of &quot;the IndianCommission during the early part, of its preliminary visit was more intensive and widespread than some of our Indian advisershad hoped or expected-   The-announcement that the commission would consist solely of Members of the British Parliament was bound to raise an outcry and the Swarajists, who were losingtheir influence and without a polic:/, seized upon it as theopportunity for reviving their fortunes.   The congress party Is so well organised and so abundantly provided withfunds that this ?fas certain to produce a striking effect,but the really serious matter was that shortly before theCommission landed in India the small party of &quot;Responslvists&quot;,who down to that moment had maintained a middle position andstood for a policy of seeking means to co-operate, wenthelter skelter over into the Swarajists camp - a mistakewhich they are now bitterly regretting, but which theycannot screw up their courage to correct by retracing theirsteps.    It was- the adherence of these moderate Indianpoliticians to the policy  of boycott which has been theunexpected and disturbing  element in the Indianparliamentary situation.      vsrhen the Commission  reached Delhi, however, the atmosphere began  to  clear.   The bold  proposal contained inmy  letter of February 6th  greatly alarmed the boycotters, whowere driven to  issue an  Instant announcement of rejection asthe only  means of preventing many of their followers and newspapers admitting that  the  substance of the Indianobjection was met.    In  private  conversation many of the extremists have  conceded that  there  was nothing more whichthe Commission  could  do, but they have kept up the attitudeof  blank  negation partly because the occupation of theSwarajists  would  be  gone if  they did not, and partly becausethey hoped  by a  show  of  continued resistance to get  further                             -1-
concessions in the future.   The methods of the Oriental&quot;bazaar come so natural to an Indian politician that hefinds it almost impossible to believe that the first wordmay also be the last.   It was for this reason that I mademy speech on &apos;29th Larch, just before we left Indian sayingplainly that we stood by our original proposal and would continue to stand by it.     Meanwhile,, very important sections of Indian opinionpronounced firmly in favour of co-operation with theCommission.   Wherever  Muhammadans are in the majoritythey have done so strongly, not because they approve ofthe exclusion of Indians, but because they hope to securethe position of their community by offering a warm welcomewhile the Hindus sulk.   A  continuance of this situation,however, has its dangers.   It  is  calculated to intensifycommunal feeling;   It will  be very difficult to satisfyIvluhammadan  claims in  full,  and  even  if this could  be done the  prospect of creating  a  ivluhammadan bloc  in  NorthernIndia,  inspired by  the  memories  of past domination and a determination  to vindicate  Its  own claims If Britain showsany  signs  of surrendering its full authority,  is analarming one.   Mr.  J innah  and  his friends  continue t$oppose  the  Commission,  &quot;but  these  gentlemen  really  carry noweight  with the mass  of the Muhammadans,  and  in any event the  Commission could  not  parley with Jlnnah without dis-gusting and disheartening the mass of the Moslem  party.      Besides  the Muhammadans, a  number  of other -minority communities came equally forward to  protest adhesion to theCommission, -  for  example,  the  Depressed  Classes,  the Anglo- Indians,  and the  Indian Christians.   They all  have a vague idea that  the  Commission can  do something  substantial  tohelp them,  though their difficulties,  for  the  most part,
                                                                 o9n                                                                 O JW frjarise from social and economic conditions which are not directly affected by changes in constitutional structure.   (I may say thatI am satisfied that the Depressed Classes will not hesitate to put their case forward in the presence of the Indian wing of the pro-posed Conference.   Their unwillingness to expose themselves to cross-examination by Brahmins was evidenced at the time of theSouthborough Committee, but things have changed since then andtheir cause will be championed not only by members of their owncommunity but by non-Brahmins also).     The vote in the Legislative Assembly on 13th February, when a resolution refusing to have any dealings with the Comm!ssion wascarried by a majority of six, showed that there were only two orthree Hindu members who at that stage were prepared to come out  infavour of the Commission - the boldest of these was Sir Hari SinghGo\.ir.   The adverse vote would of course have been much larger ifit had not been  for the nominated and Government members.   But  even so the significance of this  reverse  is easily over-rated;  Indianpoliticians are  so totally destitute of  moral courage  that tlxej  find it almost impossible to resist supporting the most extremeproposition, especially if Indian self-respect  is  said to be involved, but  It is a  very different thing to keep tip this postureof indignant protest indefinitely when nothing  happens fromassuming  it.      It was manifest  that  after  our  generous  proposals of February6thj  the  proper  course was  to avoid  all  occasions  for  giving offenceand  to  carry our programme  steadily  through.    It  soon becameobvious  that the boycott was not making  much  progress  since theCommission  never offered  itself  as  a body to  be snubbed,  &apos; &quot;Wepursued  throughout the policy of stating publicly our  willingness to  see  responsible bodies  or persons who wished to see us, but wenever invited  any individual to  come and therefore no  occasion  arose for inflicting a rebuff.   . Meanwhile,  the announcement that we werebusy, all day and every day receiving de&quot;putations and holding  friendly interviews  had a very disintegrating effect  on  the boycotters.   Their Press could not  make up its  mind whether to  ignore us  or  to report us, and was  /                        -3-
*  t&apos;il 5* driven to  adopt  the  compromise of  announcing in one column that  nobody  would  speak to  us  and  reporting at  length in the next  an interview  in which  we  explained  how well we were getting . on.         The  situation would not, however,  have  improved as rapidly as it  did  if we had remained  at  Delhi.   It  Is astonishing. what a gulf separates  the  Provinces  from  the Centre,  We made a  short stay in  Calcutta and long  tours  through the Presidency of iJadras  and  the  Province  of  the  Punjab;  and it is a striking fact  that  in each  of the three areas  the position since our visit has  definitely improved.  Sir Stanley Jackson had Intended to bring on  in the Bengal Council  the motion in favour of co- operation  before we  left, but  the  matter was adjourned,  apparently because  the  Iluhamniadans had scattered and  could not be recalled in full force.  We are  assured, however, that Bengal will carry the necossary  resolution..    In LJadras the  Chief Minister supported  us,  and  Lord  Goschen has secured the  resignation of the two  other  Ministers who  voted  against  the Commission,  and is in a  fair way to  secure  the full support  of  the  Justice Party; if this happens, Madras will also vote  for  co-operation.During  our visit to  Lahore  the Punjab Council carried  aresolution to co-operate without a dissentient  voice,  and  there is reason  to think that  the  Punjab Committee will be  a veryrepresentative and satisfactory body.   Leslie Wilson  is  veryhopeful  about Bombay.           There are therefore grounds for hoping that other provinces will follow the load which lias now been set not  only by tho Council of State but by the Punjab,  Burma and AssamCouncils.  The only Province which hu.s given an adverse voteafter my letter of 6th Pebruary Is the United Provinces, wherethe resolution refusing co-operation was carried by one vote.Sir xllc xandor Muddiman had only just arrived at  Luc know asGovernor, and he tells me that  he is quite  confident that this                             4,
 snatch, decision will be reversed..  If the three Presidencies4  &apos; voted for co-operation, the Legislative Assembly&apos; would find itself in effect surrounded., and in this event I should expect it to yield.         The question however arises whether anything can now be wisely done by the Commission or the Government to facilitate further co-operation.   There is nothing that the Commission can do, for it has already gone to the full length permitted to It save on the single point of reserving a  right in certain events to receive  evidence apart from the Indian Committee.   I think it will be found in practice that the occasions  when this reservation will come into play are very few  and limited indeed, but I am not disposed to give the point up for to do so,  while not  meeting oho  full Indian objection to a Parliamentary Commission, would be interpreted as a sign that  the Commission was giving further ground., and moreover,  if  an Indian Central Committee is appointed it max conduct  itself in such a way as  to make  it necessary to use the reservation.         I have spent a good deal of time In considering,  with the  Viceroy, whether there  is any  step  that  could  be taken by the  Government which it     beyond  the poirs$&amp; of the  Commission itself to take.   I assume  of course that the decision to constitute  the Commission solely of Members  of Parliament is irrevocable.   Mr.  Ramsay  Uacdonald&apos;s  telegram pledging his word  to this had a great  effect.   Short  of  this, however, is it&apos; possible  to imagine  some  formal  change which might  meet to  some extent the  Indian demand for  equal  status.   My letter of  6th February gave  the  Indian  Committee  equal status  with ourselves  in the opportunity  of  redommendlng what  evidence should be heard, of hearing  it,  of  questioning the  witness;, of forming conclusions, of  drafting a Report  and of getting that  Report  in the hands  of  the  King Emperor  contemporaneouslywith  our  own.   There  is, therefore, only one point left  on which  it may be suggested that
the status is unequal.   This is as to the source of theIndian Committee^ authority.   There is nothing unequal inthe Indian Legislature electing it a Oommittee as compared withthe British Parliament approving the personnel of theCommission, hut there is the difference that the Commissionersact under authority from the King Emperor whereas the IndianCommittee will act only at the suggestion of the Commission.          Proposals of various hinds have been hinted, at inthe course of private conversations I have had, with Mr.Pat el for example and Mr. Jayafcar, during the last few weeks.Mr. patel wanted to know why tho Zing Emperor has not givenme authority to co-opt a number of Indians who would, be thosechosen by the Central Legislature.   I naturally enquire whether these Indians were to take part in writing the report and pointed out that apart from all other objections this couldonly como about under Section 84(a) if tho Indian names wereto bo approved by both Houses of Parliament - a suggestion which I told Mr. Patel was quite impracticable., since neithertho House of Commons nor the House of Lords nor the Governmentwould ever contemplate it for a moment.   The only method whichhas occurred to me as at all possible is that His majesty should issue to the Viceroy a formal authority which wouldempower tho latter in the name of the  ing Emperor to constitute the Committee when appointed &quot;The Indian CentralJoint Committee&quot; - merely eyewash of course, but in Indiaeyewash ha3 a surprising effect.    I do not, however,recommend this course myself, amongst other reasons because it is likely to lead to the further objection that  such aCommittee is still not on a par with the Commission,  for theformer could not sond for persons  or papers - a power which I certainly think the Indian Committee  ought  not  to possess.          My conclusion therefore  is  that  it  Is best  to  wait uponevents,  and to avoid all semblance  of a  new departure at  present 0
 The  conduct  of  the  enquiry will,  of course,  be  vastly simpler tf there  is  ho  Indian wing&apos;,  and  indeed the prospect  of presiding over  a  Conference  with ah Indian Committoe some members of which  may be more anxious to hinder  $fotm  to help  is in the highest  degree unenviable.    But on a long  view it seems to  cao  most  Important to  secure elected Indian collaborators if  we can, for the  future would he indeed dark If the next  constitutional stop  in  India ha3 tto bo taken on the  basis of recommendations whioh  have been quite uninfluenced by Indian colleagues, so that  Indians  who have  to  live under the  Constitution  and help to work It can denounce  it as  &amp; purely alien produot with which  they have had nothing to do.           It may  be useful to  set out  my own conviction  as to the  real  reason why Indian politicians struggle so violently to avoid  accepting the scheme  of an Indian Committee working alongside the British Commission.    They profess that their objeotion springs from a sense of outraged status, but this  is not  the real reason.   The real  reason is that  if  the Indian Committee  is left to write a Heport  by itself it will find it extremely difficult to produce a  constructive plan and nay not be able to write  a Report at all.    The  task of reviewing and revising  the present Constitution of India is one  of extreme difficulty in any case and the Indian  mind is not  good at construction.   The difference therefore betwetn Indians beingmembers of a mixed Commission and Indians constituting1an allied Committee with functions corresponding to the  Commission does not  really lie in a contrast of status.&apos;   It  is  the difference between being able to write a dissenting minvite,which is  easy,  and producing a constructive plan,  which  isvery difficult.    The latter situation however  is  a perfectlyfair one and.is  the only mode of bringing Indian politiciansface to face with the practical difficulties  of tho problem.
I believe that if our proposed Joint Conference could be setup and friendly relations established between the commissioners and.the Indian wing a great deal of good might result to bothsides,- for it would give us an unrivalled opportunity ofappreciating the Indian view at close quarters and would give them an experience in examining constitutional conundrums whichthey have never attempted to face.     There is one possible development of the presentsituation which should not be overlooked.  It has alwaysseemed to me that, in view of the government&apos; s promise thata delegation from  the Indian Legislature would have theopportunity of conferring hereafter with the Joint parliamentary committee, there was a good deal to be said from the point ofview of the Indian Nationalist for leaving the Commissionseverely alone and reserving criticism for a later stage.  if however the provinces fall into line, one after the other, this summer, it seems very doubtful whether the Central Legislaturewill hold out.  But, supposing that it passes - a resolution toco-operate by a small majority, it will still remain for theCommittee to be elected, and in the use of parliamentarymachinery for their own party purposes the Swarajists are first and the rest nowhere.  They may therefore put on the Committeethe cleverest and most voluble of their extremists and seek towreck the Conference from within - very much as the congress party some years ago abandoned its policy of non-cooperationand came into the Legislature merely to make things difficult.We have stipulated that the Indian Committee must be &quot;fairlyrepresentative&quot;, and the intention is that it should be elected by means of the single non-transferable vote.  It should therefore contain in any case some members who wish to make a success of the procedure, and for the rest a good deal will depend on the unfortunate Chairman.
