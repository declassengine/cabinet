&apos;This Document is the Property  of  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;? Government.]                     Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1928.CONFIDENTIAL.                                             Copy  No. .M&amp;CP. 184 (28).  MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR FOREIGN                     AFFAIRS ON DISARMAMENT.  -                   &quot; .    I RECEIVED M.  Paul-Boncour  at  9-30 yesterday morning, as the mass, ofbusiness inside and outside the Council made it impossible to fix any more convenienthour.  I may say at once that the conversation did not take the embarrassing form which I had anticipated, as I found that he was no better instructed than  I.    M. Paul-Boncour opened the conversation by observing that it was useless  forthe Disarmament Committee to meet again unless  Great Britain and  France had previously reached agreement.   Even in this  case there would still be difficulties with other Powers, notably Italy; but if we two were agreed, something would surely.be accomplished;  it would be difficult for others to refuse.  On the other  hand, if the differences between Great Britain and France remained unreconciled,  there  couldbe no practical result from a further meeting of the committee;  for  that committeeto meet again and fail to achieve any practical result would  be worse than to haveno meeting at all.  It would then be in  fact impossible to maintain the disarmamentprovisions of the Treaties of  Peace.  He did not conceal from himself in  that case that whatever might be the treaty obligations there would be a state of public opinion which would make their enforcement impossible.  Agreement between us was there-fore a matter of the highest ulterior consequence.  With all of this I expressed myfull agreement.   . M,  Paiil-Boncour then proceeded  to  expound the concessions to our  point ofview on the  naval question, which, as a result of his conversations with Lord Cecilin March 1927, he had subsequently wrung  from the Ministry of Marine with  the help of M. Briand&apos;s powerful support.   These, he contended, were large concessions,very distasteful  to their navy, and  imposed upon French naval opinion in view ofthe grave political issues at stake, and of the  earnest desire of the French government -ment to meet our point of view.  How then did we now stand in view of the greatconcession made to our views ?    I replied that it would seem that M. Briand, who did not easily occupy himself with details, had not communicated  to him the new scheme of  classification to which,,&apos;on our side, we had brought  our Admiralty to agree in view of the earnest desirewhich we also entertained to reach agreement with France.    I then  explained to him  the  scheme of classification printed on page 4 ofMr; Cadogan&apos;s paper (W 4230/28/98)  of  the 1st May.  M. Paul-Boncour said thatif he rightly understood the proposal it amounted to this, that it would be permissibleto turn  one&apos;s 5-franc pieces into francs,  but  not one&apos;s francs into  5-franc pieces.I said this was true with the limitations which I had already explained, namely,that tonnage allotted to capital ships and aircraft carriers could not be diverted toother classes, and there must be a limit to the proportion of total tonnage which mightbe used for  submarines.  M.  Paul-Boncour observed that this still maintained  theprinciple of  classification instead of global tonnage.   Global tonnage was considered essential by  the  French Marine.  Was  classification essential to us ?  I replied atonce that it  was obviously essential.  In the proposal which I had just described tohim we had  gone to the utmost limit possible in our desire to meet the French.  Wehad indeed worked out other schemes making less concession to the French  view, anyone of which we should have greatly preferred; but I had told my colleagues that,if I was to speak to M. Briand, it must be on a footing of perfect  frankness, puttingall my cards on the table, and offering at once the maximum concession which itwas in our power to make.    Some discussion followed on the reasons for our insistence, which I endeavoured to make plain to M. Paul-Boncour.  Finally, he said that he understood our positionand our reasons.  Evidently there was a great difficulty, and he could only undertaketo report the results of our conversation to Paris and have the matter further studied.      4472A  [17789]
    Remarking that as between Great Britain and France there was, of course nojealousy and no danger of war, and that  if we two stood alone the  French could easily yield their opinion  to ours, he went  on to say that the real difficulty was, ofcourse, Italy.  The Italians would claim equality with France, and to this Francecould never. assent.  He could understand that we  did not wish to be put in theinvidious position of saying bluntly to Italy that she was not entitled to this equality,but, might  it not be possible to lay down a principle which would lead to the desiredresults without  the invidious  appearance of being directed against a particularPower ?   - I replied that M. Briand had thrown out the same suggestion in our conversationin March  and I had at once reported it to my Government, but it was difficult to pronounce  any opinion upon  it without having the text of the formula in which theprinciple would be embodied.  M. Briand had spoken of lines of communication asthe deciding factor, but even  this phrase was open to different interpretations.  Didit mean communications between the Mother-country and the Colonies, or did it meanthose and trade routes as well ?  Could M. Paul-Boncour submit a formula for our consideration ? He replied that obviously, even if we were agreed in  principle, the drafting of the  formula would be a  matter of great difficulty.   In his opinion, itshould clearly be based upon what we English are accustomed to speak of as imperial communications.   If trade routes were added, almost any country with a mercantilemarine might justify a large, and perhaps a very large, navy.    It is clear, therefore, that as I anticipated in my telegram to Lord Cushendun,the intention  of the French  was to take the length of the communications between france and her  colonies, as compared with  the  shorter  oversea communications between Italy and her colonies, as the basis of the principle or formula which wasto be devised, and it answers the question put by the  Admiralty.   As, hoAvever,M. Paul-Boncour was not in a position to carry matters further at the moment, webrought the conversation to a close.    He has to-day informed me that he had taken careful  note  of what  I  said tohim and that he had reported to M. Briand by telephone the general purport of our conversation.  In particular, he desired to be assured that he had correctly reported a phrase which I used in regard to the consequences which would follow on thefailure of  the Committee on Disarmament to produce any  results;  he cited  it  asfollows :  &apos;&apos; That  whatever  might  be the theoretical obligations of disarmamentalready imposed upon certain nations, it would, in fact, be impossible to maintain,them in such circumstances.&apos;&apos;  I confirmed the correctness of the quotation.  M. Paul-Boncour further said that he had informed M. Briand that the question was now apolitical one to be settled by the two Governments in the light of the higher political considerations involved which  it could not be the duty of the technical advisers of either Government to take into consideration.    Before M. Paul-Boncour left, I referred briefly to the question of air strengths.I do not think that he  had considered  this part of the  problem at all. Again thedifficulty was Italy. All that he could  say was that he would note my observationsand have them considered.                                                                        A.) C.June 9, 1928.
