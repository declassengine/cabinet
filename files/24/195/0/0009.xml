  THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S.....GOVERNMENT.ECRET.                  C  A B I  NET.              Copy No..P.  159/28.        MULTILATERAL  TREATY FOR THE RENUNCIATION OP V/AR.         .Memorandum  &quot;by the fru-rst Lord of the Admiralty.            I  should  like to draw the  attention of my colleagues    to  the view expressed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff    in  the Paper circulated by  the Secretary of State for War    (CP.154/28)  as to  the possible&apos;important bearing of the proposed    Treaty for the Renunciation of War on the troublesome question of    the United States of  America&apos;s attitude towards a blockade    undertaken to  enforce the sanctions of the Covenant of the League    of  Rations against  an agressor State.            As I understand the^reply  which is to be sent to the    United States  of  America 7s  proposal by His Majesty&apos;s Government    in  Great Britain  our intention is  to provide,  in an explanatory    Memorandum to  accompany the Treaty, that a State which in    conformity with its obligations under the Covenant or the Locarno    Treaty shall have become involved  in war In the application of    sanctions  against a State that has broken its  pledges under    either of  these,  shall not  be deemed to have committed a breach    of the Pact for the Renunciation of War.   If that is so it    follows  that the  United States of  America or any other signatory    of  the Pact,  even though under no  obligations  under the Covenant    or  other special  Treaty,  will be precluded by Its adherence to    the Pact not only from taking advantage of a state of war to come    to  the aid of the agressor  State but from threatening war as    &quot;an instrument of policy&quot; should the actlor. of the State or    States blockading the latter be such as does not commend itself    to  tho United  States  of America&apos;s  Ideas on the &quot;freedom of the    seas&quot;.                                                         This . . i.
      This is of greet importance,and if there Is any chanceof the United States of America accepting such an Interpretatio:of the Pact we ought not to fail to secure it.   Whether Itwould be wise to bring this effect  of our conditions of acceptance to the notice of the Americans with a view to seeinghow they react to it, rather than to run the risk of being charged with having &quot;drawn wool over their eyes&quot; in the. event o:their accepting it without further  elucidation,  is not so easy to decide.                     (Initialled)   v&apos;.  G.  B.ADMIRALTY,   S.W.T.    15th May, 1928.
