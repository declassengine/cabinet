This  Document is the Property of His Britannic  Majcsty*s Government.Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1928.SECRET.                                                      Copy  No.O.P.  153 (28).CABINET.REVISED  DRAFT  TREATY OF  ARBITRATION WITH THE                       UNITED STATES.               MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR.     IN view of the prominence wliich has been given in recent discussions to thequestion of the best means of safeguarding our belligerent rights at sea in connectionwith the arbitration proposals put forward by the United States of America, I thinkit advisable  to draw  my  colleagues&apos; attention  to the fact that,  if any specificreservation is to be made, it is important that its terms shall be such as to cover air action as well  as the &quot; naval  pressure &quot; referred to on page 5 of the second of thetwo memoranda by the Foreign Secretary annexed to CP. 76 (28).     2.  Belligerent rights at  sea  are, of  course,  and are  likely  to remain,  apredominantly naval interest.   In future wars, however, aircraft are certain to play a role of increasing importance in their exercise.   To take a single illustration, flyingboat?, operating in pairs or in larger formations, could effectively undertake the visit and search of neutral  vessels, one or more machines remaining in the air as a safe-guard against any attempt to escape or to offer obstruction to the boarding party.     It is. therefore, essential to secure that nothing in the  projected Treaty shallcurtail the exercise of air, no less than naval, pressure at sea in future wars.     3.   I hesitate to express an opinion as to  the extent to which our position islegally safeguarded by the form of woids employed in Article 2 in its latest form (see cp. 117 (28)), whereby  the Treaty applies only to differences &quot; which are  agreed tobe  justiciable  in  their nature  by  reason of being susceptible of decision  by theapplication of a  recognised rule of international law.&quot;  As  at present advised,however.  I  share  the misgivings  which the  First  Lord  has expressed  in  his memorandum CP. 135 (28).     4-.  The question  has  two aspects (1) legal,  and (2) political.   Even if we arereassm d as to the former (I presume the saving word is  agreed &quot;;  it is not statedbetween  whom). I  confess to being very dubious  as to the wisdom, when we are dealing with so important  and controversial  a subject, of taking our stand on what might, I think, be easily misrepresented as a verbal quibble, and lead to damagingcharges of bad faith and  we have lately seen what the United States Press can  doin this direction.  My doubts are increased by two recent developments to which theForeign Secretary  has drawn attention  in  paragraph  5 of  his despatch  of the5th April to Sir E. Howard (CP. 112 (28)).  These are (a) that Senator Borah hasintroduced into the Senate a resolution urging the importance of  recodifying,  bymeans  of an  international  agreement, &quot; the rules of  war governing the conduct  ofbelligerents or  neutrals in war and at sea,&quot;* and (b) that the twenty-one  States ofthe Pan-American Union  concluded at the Havana  Conference a  convention  onMaritime Neutrality which appears at first sight to  contain nothing &quot; inconsistent with the idea  of an ultimate agreement  on  this subject between the Empire andthe United States.&quot;   If we rely solely on the phrase above quoted  from the  latestversion of Article  2 of  the  Treaty to secure  the exercise of our full  belligerentrights,  shall we not  seriously  have compromised  the  future in  the  event  of    * Apparently rejected, since this memorandum was  written, by the  Naval  Affairs  (Jommitteo of the senate (see telegram No. 142 of May 4 from Sir E. Howard), but liable, I presume, to bo revived.       [17630]
our  ultimately  reaching  an  agreement  with the  United  States  on principles?For, under actual war conditions, there  would be bound (as always) to be sharpdifferences of opinion  as  to  the legality  or  otherwise of  particular  practicalapplications of these principles, and the  United States would doubtless  colourablycontend that we were by this Treaty committed to submitting such differences ofopinion to the &quot; Permanent Court of International Justice or some other  competenttribunal.&quot;  I  fear that we should, in fact, have sown the seeds of much futurecontroversy, which would  probably come to a head at  a time of crisis  when ourrelations with the United States would be likely to be peculiarly delicate and when we might once more be dependent upon  them for essential supplies, so  that  theirgoodwill would be a matter of even greater importance than it is  to-day.     5.  Whilst, therefore, I fully  appreciate that,  in view of recent events, thereare, as. the Foreign Secretary has emphasised, political objections to any specificreservation of belligerent rights at sea, I feel that the possibility of devising  someless ambiguous formula (sucfi as  that of the exclusion of &quot; vital interests &quot; suggestedby the First Lord) should be very carefully explored                                                                        S.  H.     A ir Mi7iistry, May 2,  1928
