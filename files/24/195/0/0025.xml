[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1928.SECRET.                                                      Copy No.   28CP. 175 (28).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE ADEN POLICE FORCE.                                  REPORT.    AT a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 23rd May, 1928 (Reference :  Cabinet30 (28), Conclusion 8), the Cabinet agreed :     That a Committee composed as follows :         The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),        The Secretary of State for the Colonies,        The Secretary of State for India,        The Secretary of State for Air,        A representative of the Treasury (in an advisory capacity);should meet as soon as possible to consider the question of the steps which shouldbe taken to secure an efficient Police force at Aden.    2.  The Committee met on the 24th May.  Mr. G. C. TJpcott, Deputy controller of Supply Services,  Treasury, attended in an advisory capacity;  and Marshal ofthe Royal Air Force Sir Hugh Trenchard and Sir Arthur Hirtzel were also invitedto be present.    3.  The particular proposition referred to  us cannot  be readily  understoodwithout reference to some of the  more general considerations which bear on it.   InOctober 1927 the Cabinet decided* that the responsibility for the defence of the aden Protectorate should be transferred from the War Office  to the Air Ministry,and that radical changes should be made in the composition of the garrison.  Boththe infantry battalions and the Aden Troop were to be withdrawn;  the strength pfthe Royal Air Force was to be increased from one flight to a full squadron; andthree armoured cars and a force of locally-raised  levies were to be added.    4.  The Air Ministry assumed control last J anuary;  and considerable progress has been made with the reorganisation. The Indian battalion  left Aden  in March;the Aden Troopt is under disbandment; and the tribal levies are being raised.  there remains the British battalion. The date fixed by  agreement between the Chancellorof the Exchequer and  the Departments concerned  for the withdrawal of this unitis the end of this year.  It has, however, been represented, first that the retentionof the battalion beyond the autumns will result in an over-expenditure of  estimates;secondly, that it is most important that the accommodation which it occupies shouldbe made available as soon as possible for Air Force personnel, who are  now  livingunder the most uncomfortable conditions in temporary huts;  and thirdly, that the contemplated reductions in the ancillary Services cannot be made so long as it remains at Aden.  The conclusion which emerges is that every effort should be made to ensurethat the British battalion can be  withdrawn by next autumn.    * Reference: Cabinet 52 (27), Conclusion 9.    t Half of the Aden Troop is, as a temporary measure, providing detachments for the islands of Perimand Kamaran, pending th6 raising of armed police for this purpose.

     5-. &apos; There is, however, this difficulty;  The Chief of the Air Staff told us that it  is  a fundamental principle  of air control  in  uncivilised,  and  semi-civilisedj countries, that the Air Force should not be required to undertake the maintenance of ordinary law and order, or to deal with minor disturbances;  and that civil work of that kind should be done by police.  Applying this principle to the particular case of Aden, he said that the provision of an armed police force which is competent to maintain law and order in the settlement of Aden, and in the islands of Perim and Kamaran, is an indispensable condition of effective air control.  The  existing Aden Police Force is, of itself, competent to do none of these things.     6.  The Aden Police Force is administered by the Government of India, who are still responsible  for municipal law  and order; and it has been  described as an unarmed, unorganised, untrained &quot; riff-raff.&quot;  This state of affairs may have been of no great consequence so long as infantry battalions were available  to  provide a backing in Aden itself, and to furnish detachments for  the maintenance of&quot; law and order  in Perim and Kamaran; but the change from military to air control obviously introduces a different set of conditions.  We  are satisfied that the British battalion cannot be withdrawn from Aden until a reasonably efficient armed police force of adequate strength has been brought into existence.     7.  This brings us to the crux of the problem.   How is the Aden Police Force to  be  brought to the required standard  with the  least  possible  delay ?   On this question there is a  direct conflict of  opinion.   The Air  Ministry have suggested, first, that the responsibility for police arrangements at  Aden should be transferred from the Indian to the Home Government; and, secondly, that the force should be raised locally by selected British officers sent out from England.  The Government of India, on the other hand, are positive that armed police of the type required  cannot be  formed out of local material;  and they  are supported in this opinion  by the Government  of Bombay, the late Resident, and the present acting Resident.  Their counter-suggestion,  that  the  problem  can be solved only by  the recruitment of personnel in India,  is unacceptable to the Air Ministry on account of the expense involved in the cost of passages to and from India,  furlough in India,  and so  on.     Colonel  Symes, the Resident designate, who is not due to take up his appoint- ment until the 15th July, is not at present prepared to express  a definite opinion one way or the other,  but he has undertaken to do so by the end of August.     8.  We  are thus faced with  the following alternatives : Are we to  disregard the consensus of local opinion, and to advise the Cabinet to go ahead immediately with local recruitment ? or, alternatively, ought  the decision on this question to be postponed until  the new Resident  is in a position  to submit his considered recommendations?     The first alternative has undoubted  attractions, especially on the grounds of economy.   Moreover, we ourselves incline to the view that even the most unpromising material can as a rule be forged into a reasonably efficient weapon by the right type of British Officer.  On the other hand, we would be incurring a grave  responsibility if,  in the absence of a definite expression of  opinion by the Resident  designate, wewere to overrule all the expert advice at present available except that of the Air Officer commanding  at  Aden unless  there were overwhelming  reasons  to justify our  doing  so.  As we  see it, these reasons  do not exist.   Moreover it  would be unreasonable to  present the officer who is to be responsible for implementing thescheme with a fait accompli,  of which  he  may wholly  disapprove.   In all  thecircumstances, we consider that there is no alternative to accepting the inconvenience and expense  involved in postponing the decision on this point until Colonel  Symesis in a position to  submit his considered recommendations.     9,   At the same time, it is important that the delay which our recommendationinevitably involves should be reduced to a minimum.   Accordingly, we  consider thatthe urgency of this police question should be impressed on Colonel Symes before his departure; and that he should be instructed to telegraph his  full recommendations as to all the  steps  which should be taken  to secure  an efficient police force, as soonas possible and in any event not more than six weeks after his arrival at Aden.     10.  Again, anything that can be done in the interim to put the existing force at Aden .on a less deplorable footing than at  present will obviously hasten the day when the British battalion can safely be withdrawn.   We therefore recommend thatthe Government of India should be pressed immediately to make available one  or

We therefore recommend thatthe Government of India  should be pressed immediately to make available one or
two British Officers of the Indian Police to be sent to Aden to reorganise and trainthe existing force.            ,    11.   Finally, we consider that all possible arrangements to meet the contingency of local recruitment, or, alternatively, of recruitment in India, should be preconcertedby the Departments concerned, in consultation with each other and with the Govern-ment of India, in order that immediate action may be taken on whichever decision is made by the Cabinet as a result of Colonel Symes&apos;s recommendations.    12.   We  summarise our conclusions as follows :     (a.) It is most important that the British  Battalion  now at Aden  should  be          withdrawn at the earliest possible moment; but  this cannot be done until          a reasonably efficient armed police force of adequate strength  is available.          (Paragraphs 4r 6.)    (b.) The cheapest method of raising a police force in Aden is by local recruit-          ment;  and the  Chief of  the Air Staff is convinced that, with  British          Officers, an efficient force  can be raised in this way.  On the other hand,          local  opinion at present available  is practically  unanimous that an          efficient force cannot be formed out of local material.   In these circum-          stances  a final decision on the  possibility of recruiting personnel locally          ought not to  be taken until Colonel Symes (Resident designate of Aden)          is in a position to make recommendations.  (Paragraphs 7-8.)    (c.)  The urgency of the question should be impressed on Colonel Symes  before          his departure; and every effort should be made to ensure his arrival  at          Aden at the earliest possible moment.   He should be  instructed to submit          full recommendations as to all  the steps which should  be taken to secure          an efficient police  force at Aden, as  soon as possible and  in any case          not later than six weeks after his arrival. (Paragraph 9.)    (d.) The Government of India should  be pressed immediately to make available          one or two British Officers of  the Indian Police, to be sent to Aden  to          reorganise and train the existing police force.  (Paragraph 10.)    (e.)  All possible arrangements to meet the contingency of local recruitment, or,          alternatively,  of recruitment in India,  should  be preconcerted by the          Departments concerned,  in  consultation with each  other  and with the          Government of India, in  order that immediate  action may be taken on          Colonel Symes&apos;s recommendations.  (Paragraph 11.)                                   Signed on behalf of the Committee,                                                   HAILSHAM (Chairman).2,  Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,     June 5, 1928.
