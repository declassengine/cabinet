WITH  reference to  CP.  82  (28),  I  circulate  herewith, for  ray  colleagues&apos;information, a copy of a letter which I have written to  the  Foreign Secretary on thesubject of Anglo-French-Italian air parity covering some  notes on a letter  from theFrench Ambassador, dated the 9th February, which is reproduced as an appendix.                                                                         S.  H.    Air Ministry, May 24, 1928.The Right Hon. Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G., M.P.Dear Secretary of State,                                           May 23, 1928.    I have not written to you earlier on the subject of the letter addressed to you bythe French Ambassador on the 9th February dealing with the proposal for an agreement for air parity between  England, France and  Italy, and  your subsequent conversationwith Briand, reported in CP. 82 (28), dated the 10th  March, since you  did not specifically ask for my views, and as you, Cushendun and  the Cabinet have been very fully occupied in the interim with other aspects of the complex problem of disarmament,it did not seem necessary to  trouble you.    When, however, a suitable opportunity arises, you will doubtless wish to take thematter further, and  you may, therefore, like to have my comments on some  of thepoints that have emerged.   I  give them accordingly at some length in the annexedmemorandum, not, of course, that I contemplate you will  wish  yourself to enter intodetails with the French and Italians they can be reserved for the air experts but because a background of detail may be helpful to  you when discussing the matter in broad outline.    I hope you may perhaps be able  to find in the memorandum a peg upon which indue course you can hang the  restimpliou of  informal  conversations with a view tofurther progress towards our goal, viz., the limitation of air  armaments on a  basis of anglo-French-Italian parity.    If you require further explanation on any of the points it raises,  I  am at yourdisposal to discuss them.    Since your conversations  with the French were initiated  in conformity  with aCabinet  decision  and  you  have circulated  to  our colleagues an account of yourconversation with Briand  in March,  I  propose, if  you concur, to circulate this letter and memorandum to the Cabinet and also to the Committee on Disarmament Policy.    I apologise for the length of the memorandum, but the subject is so intricate andof  such first-rate importance  that I have thought it well to give you a collective resume of  the main points involved, most of which have not previously been put on record,.since I have been reluctant to add to the mass of papers on disarmament, and particularlynaval disarmament, circulated during the past few months.    I profoundly hope  we shall be able in due course to arrive at a parity agreement,.though doubtless there will be many obstacles to overcome.  If we fail, through Frenchand Italian intransigence, we shall at least be able to point to our efforts as conclusive-evidence of our &quot; will to peace.&quot;                                                   Yours sincerely,                                                            SAMUEL  HOARE.    P.S. I am sending a copy  of the letter and memorandum to Cushendun.[17712]B
 Notes by the Secretary of  State for  Air on  Anglo-French-Italian Air  Parity, with     particular  reference  to a letter from the French Ambassador in London to the     Foreign Secretary, dated February 9, 1928.     1.   Since in the Foreign  Secretary&apos;s conversation with M. Briand in March (see CP. 82  (28) ) allusion was made to current air strengths, it may be convenient to open these notes by stating the  position as regards our own and the French  and Italian Air Forces at the present time.     The Foreign Secretary drew M.  Briand&apos;s attention  to  the  fact  of  the French. Chamber having recently voted &quot; something like a minimum of 150 air squadrons with the  possibility  of an  unlimited increase,&quot;  adding that  &quot;he believed that our own squadrons were at most  one-third  of  this number.&quot;   The combined strength of the French  naval, military  and colonial  air services is already 154  squadrons, but the corresponding British figure is 69, or 62  if squadrons manned with special reserve and auxiliary personnel are excluded  (see paragraph 3 (a) below).   These figures  are, however, for total strengths the world over.  If the comparison is confined to squadrons at home, we have 43 (or  36 if we again exclude the units manned  by non-regular personnel) on which  basis  the ratio  of  3 to 1 for French as compared with British squadrons is correct.   It is also the fact that Article 14  of the  Projet de Loi des Cadres et Effectifs does  not  fix a  definite number  of  squadrons, but speaks merely of  &quot; unnombre variable d&apos;escadrilles,&quot; thus apparently  leaving the French. Government free to form  as  many additional  squadrons as it chooses by  simple executive action withoutfurther legislation.     2.   Squadrons, however, are not  really an exact comparative measure of effectivefighting  strength in the air which it is  necessary to assess rather in terms  of  first-linemachines, inasmuch as a French squadron comprises from 8 to 10 machines, accordingto its functions, and an Italian  squadron normally 9, whilst the great majority of ourown have an establishment of 12.     The position is as shown in the following table : . Strength in First-Line Machines.	Great Britain.	Prance.	Italy.Strengths at Home... Strengths Overseas... Total Strengths ...	497 279 &quot;	1,088 285 &apos;.,	788 74	776	1,373	862     3.   I had perhaps better make three explanatory comments on the figures in this table :      (a.) Of our 497 machines at home, 80 are  on the  strength of Special Reserve  or           Auxiliary  Squadrons, i.e.,  units  manned with  non-regular personnel,  so           that, on a stricter basis of  comparison with the  corresponding French and           Italian figures, our total strength should be 696 rather than 776.     (6.)  The Italian Uuder-Secretary of State for Air stated in  the Italian Chamber           in the course  of the recent debate on Air  Estimates that Italy&apos;s first-line           strength was in excess of 1,000 machines.  We regard this figure as an over-           statement, since the Italian squadrons in 1927 spent  rather less  than half           as many hours in the air as our own with a strength 25 per cent, less than           that  claimed  by the Italians who, incidentally (to  add an interesting if           irrelevant gloss), had a fatal casualty rate in relation to hours flown five           times as heavy as ours.     (c.) The  figures include all aircraft, military, naval and  independent,  whether           shore-based or ship-borne.   It will  be recollected that we ourselves, in the           draft approved by the Cabinet before Lord Cecil  went to Geneva, suggested           (Chapter IV, 10 (1)) that only shore-based aircraft  should come within the           scope of  the Disarmament  Convention.  On merits there is  a great deal           to  be  said in  favoixr   of  excluding ship-borne aircraft  for the  sake  of           simplifying the problem.   It  would, however, clearly be impolitic  in the           extreme to press this point upon, or even raise it with, the  French as they
           would be able, should we do so, to accuse us of a self-interested inconsistency.           They would  argue colourably enough that we were  claiming to exclude           aircraft allocated  for  co-operation with  the  British  Navy, the  strength           of which we justify  by  the peculiar  geographical conformation  of the           Empire,  whilst  pressing  for  the  inclusion  of  aircraft  allocated for           co-operation  with  the  French  Army, the  size  of which  is  similarly           necessitated by the geographical factor.   For  us to  urge, therefore, at this           juncture the  exclusion  of naval  aircraft would give  away our  case  as           regards French Army  aircraft.   For I am bound to concede that, though           the position  is  by no means in all respects parallel, our naval aircraft (in           which we are for the time being the stronger) would, in the  unlikely event           of the  Navy not being engaged in active  operations, be available for           independent  employment as bombers, fighters, &amp;c., just as we contend (see           paragraph 6  below) that the  French Army co-operation  aircraft  could in           the event of a  war in which their Army was not fully engaged and this           would be the case in a war with Great Britain single-handed be similarly           diverted to an independent air role.    4.  The figures in the  table strikingly demonstrate the disparity between our ownstrength and that of the French, and make  the non possumus attitude  of M. Fleuriauthe more difficult to understand or at all events to justify.    5.  The Air Ministry view is quite definitely that any parity agreement should bebased on strengths &quot; at home,&quot; since these represent the aircraft which at  the present stage of development could be effectively and immediately brought into action.  Further,there  should be no difficulty in justifying this  basis from  the  British  point of  viewhaving regard to the extent of our Imperial overseas commitments.  It  should alsocommend  itself to the  French, who maintain approximately  the  same  number of machines  overseas  as  we do, and, like ourselves, entered a reservation on the point inconnection with the formula  provisionally adopted by the Preparatory  Commissionin the  draft Disarmament  Convention.  This formula (vide Chapter II, Section III,Article AA) makes no distinction between aircraft at home and overseas, but embraces&quot; all aircraft in service in the armed forces &quot; of the  signatory States.    At  the last meeting  of the Policy  Committee (vide P.R.A. (27), 7th Cons., p. 7) theForeign Secretary mentioned  that  M. Briand, in connection with naval disarmament,had laid some emphasis on French overseas commitments, which  also suggests thepossibility of their coming  into  line with us in this matter.  I believe M. Briand saidsomething very similar at the  time of the Washington Conference^    According to my information  the Italians too, though, as the table  shows, theymaintain only a very small  proportion of their air force outside Italy, are  not likely tobe unreasonable about the exclusion of machines stationed overseas, the  justification for separate &quot; Home &quot; and &quot; Overseas &quot; categories being indeed  difficult to dispute.    In these circumstances I should hope that  there will be no difficulty in securingthe consent  of both parties to a &quot; strengths at Home &quot; basis,    In the unlikely event, however, of the French and Italians combining in a demand that parity should be calculated on a basis of total  strengths, I do not suggest  that, ifa breakdown otherwise is inevitable, we should necessarily nail our colours to the mast.on the exclusion of aircraft  overseas, provided we face the fact that our position wouldhe definitely weakened by giving way  on this point.    6.  To return to M.  Fleuriau&apos;s letter (a copy of which  I attach as an appendix to-these notes), the gist of  his argument is, so far as I can  follow it, that Anglo-Frenchparity is not practicable  because we maintain a separate unified Air Force, whilst theFrench  air services are affiliated  to  their  Navy and Army.   This  is a double-edgedargument from the French point of  view  which can, I think, be turned against them, apoint to which I return below in paragraph 9.    The fact remains that the aircraft allotted to the French Navy and Army could atany moment be diverted  and  used   independently, t   M. Fleuriau  virtually admits as-much, though he states that to do so would be a lengthy  business.    This is  not the-   * The following- is an extract  from a telegram despatched by M. Briand at this time:        &quot; I do not believe it is the programme to deny  to a nation like France, which has a  large extent of   coast and a great number of distant  colonies, the means of defending  its communications and its.    security.&quot;   t French Army aircraft are, of course, the more serious factor since the  large strength of machinesallocated to  Army co-operation could readily be employed as bombers, being in fact in most units of exactly the same type, with a few minor modifications.      [17712]                                                            B 2 -
 case.  Admittedly the present orientation of French air policy is towards the  Rhine - indeed we can give the word its literal derivative  meaning.   But to face about to the North-West would be an easy step which could be rapidly effected in the unfortunate - and I trust improbable-event of a change for  the worse  in  Anglo-French relations. It is, therefore, difficult to see how the normal allocation, organisation and functions of these squadrons vitiate the calculation of our respective strengths which we have no alternative but to make, as M. Fleuriau, I am glad to see, concedes.     7.  M. Fleuriau further says that &quot; the Royal  Air Force has set  itself  a problem entirely  separate from the problem which the Army and Navy are trying on their part to solve.   It  proposes to  secure  on  its own the defence  of  Great Britain  against enemy air attacks  and to  contribute also on  its own  to  the  defence of the British Empire.&quot;   This (whilst not a completely accurate statement of  the position) is broadly true but does it not suggest, particularly when we  regard the magnitude of our oversea commitments and  take  into  account the  fact that  our squadrons at home are definitely  maintained  as  an Imperial  Reserve in addition to their Home  Defence functions, that our air strength is in fact absurdly low and that we should be justified in asking for  something more than parity ?     This may appear at first sight rather a debating point.   Apart, however, from the fact that M. Fleuriau&apos;s letter seems to me  somewhat of a &quot; debating&quot; letter, the  point is also one of substance.   It is in this  connection permissible to remind the  French that omitting coloured  troops in  both  cases the strength of the regular  British Army in time of peace is nearly two-thirds that of the French, and that by the  close of the late war the United Kingdom had  raised  an Army some 3,750,000  strong, whilst our air strength, though still in progress of  rapid expansion, was little short of the French and would in all probability soon  have overtaken  them.   Clearly then a demand for parity to-day is only reasonable.     8.   A more cogent  line of argument  to develop  might, however, it seems  to me, be.  the following:  What we are seeking is not a 6ipartite, but a  tripartite parity agreement, and I suggest we should emphasise to the French the importance of taking Italy and the  Italians into  our  calculations.  For the purpose we can, I think, make play with the vast programme of expansion which  Italy has formulated and never (so far as our information goes) abandoned.   Indeed, the  Italian Under-Secretary of  Statefor Air has recently publicly stated  that their  programme will  be  carried  out to its maximum as soon as the financial position  of the country admits of it..  Quite clearly,however, it will take a much longer period to achieve than was originally visualised.     For the  purpose of this argument,  we  can  quote the Italians&apos;  own  publishedestimate of their  firstdine strength  to which I have  already alluded, viz., over 1,000machines.   We can further point out that, though still a considerable way behind theFrench, they are fast overtaking them, whilst their  ultimate goal, according  to a RoyalDecree of 1925, is a force of no less than 1,600 first-line  aircraft a  figure  that iswell in excess of the present French  strength.   Admittedly, financial stringency has caused the Italians to slow down their programme  from year  to year, but, as I have said, it has not been abandoned,  and in the three years 1925-28 the  Regia Aeronauticahas been increased by over 250 first-line machines.     9.  The French, then, have three alternative courses open to them :     (1.)  They can (as that strict Gallic logic on which  they pride  themselves would           seem to require) stand by and see turned against themselves the argument           which M. Fleuriau seeks to employ  against a proposal  for  Anglo-French           parity.    This would necessitate their  accepting a position of  definite           inferiority  vis-a-vis  the  Italians.    For  the  latter   could   (following           M. Fleuriau&apos;s line of reasoning, which, as  I have already said, cuts  both           ways) justify their expansion on the grounds that they, like the British,           have a separate Air Force, which  has set itself an independent role, in            addition  to those of naval and military  co-operation,  and that for  this           purpose they claim a total strength of 1,600 machines is  necessary.*     (2.)  They can join in a  race of air armaments  and embark  on  an intolerable air            expenditure.     (3.)  They can whole-heartedly support our proposals for an Anglo-French-Italian           parity agreement.    * In this connection I understand that Italy&apos;s peace army in the training-  season musters only some50,000 men less than that of France 320,000 as compared -with 370,000, omitting native and colonial troopsin both cases, and deducting from the French total  figure of 400,000; 30,000 men for the personnel of  their,Army Air Service.
9 Q    Do either of the first two courses commend themselves to the French?  If not, does[not self-interest, no less than the interests of European peace and disarmament, point to the desirability of calling an early halt to schemes of air expansion by the adoption of the third?                            .                          .   ,   .     &apos;    .  &apos;    10.  There can, of course, be nothing derogatory to  French dignity in  accepting air parity with the Italians, since under the terms of the Treaty  of  Washington they have already accepted naval parky with them in capital ship tonnage.    11.  Whilst Great Britain will, naturally, be free under these parity proposals, if she so desires, to build up to whatever limit may be agreed,  we have years of leeway to make  up,  and I  am  not, of course,  suggesting that we should  be committed to so doing in actual practice.    In so far,  however, as our partners in the proposed agreement are concerned,  the potential existence  of a British air force of equal strength should  surely  be of the utmost value to France  as a counterpoise to Italy and to  Italy as  a counterpoise to Trance, and possibly this point  could  be discreetly made with them.    12.  Perhaps I should add a word on one other  point made by M. Fleuriau when he states that our air expenditure is roughly the same as the French.  The  answer is, of course,  that, apart from  other factors which  vitiate  any comparison, the defence expenditure of a country which relief on voluntary recruitment can never be measured against that of a con scrip tionist country.   For  example, our pay vote alone is over three times that of the French Army  Air Service, though its personnel outnumber  our own.  There is a similar disparity in Navy  and Army expenditure in the two countries.                                                                           S. IT.                                  APPENDIX.Sir Austen Chamberlain.                                                   Wrench Embassy, London,Dear Sir Austen,                                               February 9,  1928.    I will acquaint M. Briand with your suggestion with  regard to  air  armaments,but  from information which I obtained yesterday I realise the  difficulties you willencounter in the execution  of your scheme  by reason  of the  difference between  theBritish and French aviation  programmes.    The Royal Air Force has set itself a problem entirely separate  from the problems which the Army and Navy are trying on their part to solve.   It proposes to ensure, onits own, the defence of Great Britain against  enemy air attacks, and to contribute, also on its own, to the defence of the British Empire.    It has therefore constituted an air staff and is providing for purely  air operationsdirected by itself in the same way as naval operations are directed  by the Admiralty.    The French Air Service, on the contrary, has no separate existence or programme.It is part of the Army and the Navy.  It  is  organised not with  a view  to separateoperations,  but with a view to taking part in  the operations of the Navy  and Army.Its increase or decrease depends on  the increase or decrease  in the land or naval forcesof  which the  air forces are  a complementary part.  In France  the  allocation andmobilisation of the land  air forces  are  established, not with a  view to preparation for purely air operations as in Britain, but in accordance with the plan of Army operations ;iu other words, the whole force is directed towards the land frontiers, which it is  theArmy&apos;s job to defend.  The French aviation system  explains why&quot;.&quot;at Geneva we have always supported the system of disarmament of the whole  of  the land,  naval  and airforces.    It will therefore be very difficult for M. Briand to seek  with you a way to  balance the  two air forces, of which one, the British, is an independent force, and the other,  theFrench, is a branch of the Army and the Navy.    I am aware that the promoters of the British air force as a separate independentarm make a great  deal of the air power of  France, and I admit that it is difficult forthem to take any other basis of comparison, but their ardour carries them too far whenthey look upon the French air force as a menace to Great Britain.
     I am not merely alluding here to the friendly relations between the two countries!but  to  the allocation and organisation of the French  air service, which are directejtowards  the Rhine, not towards the Channel.   It cannot be said that it would  \Mimpossible for  the  French Squadrons to be directed against Britain, but no provisiojhas  been made for an attack in this direction, and it  would be a lengthy business tlchange their whole  plan and turn them into the  bugbear we hear about  from time titime in  the &quot; Daily Express.&quot;  I may add that  at the  present rates of  exchange thjFrench and British  aviation budgets are more or less the same in total amount.     I thought it as well to acquaint you  immediately with what I had learnt, andlremain,  &amp;c.                                              (Signed)      A.  DE FLEURIAU.
