They were unanimouslyof the opinion that an agreement must he reached, with us.Basis proposed is agreement on a formula which would deter-mine relative cruiser strength according to length of linesof communication.   They argue that this basis lies at the root of claims put forward by Americans and ourselves andshould therefore be satisfactory to us both.  At the sametime It would give the French the necessary superiority  overthe Italians in classes below capital ships.  If that is secured Monsieur Briand considers there will be no difficultyin securing French assent to classification which I ,proposed to him in March.          I am to discuss question fully with. Boncour andshall try to get an agreement on these lines added.          Please inform Lords Salisbury and Cushendun and admiralty.   I shall be glad to receive their observationsfor my guidance at the earliest possible moment.          Following for Secretary of State from lord cushendun.          After conversation to-day &quot;with First Sea Lord Ihave arranged for him to attend Cabinet to-morrow.  Meantime(ii)Cypher telegram to His Ma .]esty1 s Consul  (Geneva).     Foreign Office,- 5th  June, 1928, 10,30 p.m,Ho. 40.:MMEDIATE.Your telegram Up. 56 LoIL, (of June 3rd).
Admiralty comment on your interview with I. Briandis contained in following minute handed to me by sir charles Madden,     Begins.          The Admiralty suggest that we are on unsoundground if we agree with the French that the length of thelines of communication should form the basis for estimatingcruiser strengths.   The statement that such a basis is atthe root of the arguments of ourselves -and united States isnot correct.  we have always maintained that the length ofthe lines is only one, and not the most important, of the factors.   Other factors are the vital nature and volume ofthe trade and the geographical position of the route.          It is not clear further from Sir AustenChamberlain1s telegram what the French mean by lines ofcommunication.  It Is Important to be certain of this.  Dothey mean the lines of cormmrnication along which the wholetrade of the country passes, such lines going to foreignas well as colonial ports or do they mean the lines ofcommunication only to overseas possessions?   If thelatter it is likely to raise serious resistance both from america and Italy and if we accepted it we should find ourselves aligned with France against these, two countries and basing ourselves on an argument most difficult tojustify,,          The former definition is considered the true onebut is probably not that intended by  ranee as therebys^etsid- would obtain no advantage over Italy in relativecruiser strengths.

                 DISARLfiMEffT. Docypher.   From His MajestyTs  Consul.  (Geneva).                                           June  7th.,  19 8.            D.     11.35  p.m.  June  7th,  1928i            R.      9.30  a.m.  June  8th,  1928. Eo .  64. L.. N.                 -----oOo----     Following  for Lord  Cushendun  and the  Cabinet:-     Your telegrans Bos. 40 and  42.     I did not  desire  to intervene in discussion  on disarmament but  you and  others strongly urged that no agreement would  ever be  reached  if matter  were  left  in hands of French  Ministry of Marine and  that the only chance of succeeding was that I  should  take it  up withM. Briand.   Accordingly, as you will remember, I spoke to him in March  and in the course  of that  conversation he broached suggestions which he repeated  in  my conversationwith him iii Paris  the  other day, as reported in my telegram Ho. 56  from Geneva.     The first conversation was  reported to, and discussed by, Lord Salisbury&apos;s committee.     It was then pointedout that if we came to an agreement with France on thebasis suggested we  should&apos; still  find ourselves opposed by Italy and the United States of America.     This statement the Admiralty now  repeat;  but I understood the Committeeto hold that as  it was impossible  to find  any scheme onwhich all four Powers could agree  it was better to have one friend and so be two against two than  to find ourselves confronted by  tho other  three, and verypossibly Japan also, and thus  have thrown upon us  theodium of a breakdown.
      This  point,  therefore,  I  understood  to have  teen settled  in favour of M.  Briand!s  suggestion;  but  the Admiralty  now  raise another  point.   They argue thet a strength proportionate to  the  length of our Imperial communications  (which in faot  extend over every ocean)would be inadequate for  the  British Empire and that itwould be a basis  difficult to  justify in  argument.Although the Admiralty have  h&amp;d three months to considerthe March  conversations, and although I particularly asked that  they should at  once study M. Briand1s sugges-tion  I do  not remember that  they  ever before raised thispoint or that when I was asked to enquire what progressM. Briand was making in  his;conversation with the french minister of Marine it was  suggested that  I had betterwarn him that it would be useless to proceed on this basis.   I  an now at a loss  to  know how to proceed.I presume  all I can do is to listen to.what M. Boncourhas to say  and undertake to  report it to my colleagues,but that I must be careful to refrain from giving himany encouragement.   I fear  this makes failure- ofattempt  to soek a basis  of agreement.with France throughthe Foreign Office quite unavoidable and that  resultmust be  that when committee  on disarmament meets againyou will find yourself without any support from other powers on nava.1 question.    Is Admiralty objectionreally sound?   Surely if we substitute trade  route forImperial communications  it  will have some  very oddresult:   as for instance in the case of Italy  whichI think runs line not only  to South  America and australia but also to India and the  Far East.    Would
 it not mean that every nation that has a mercantilemarine carrying on anything more than a loots,! trade would be entitled to the same cruiser strength?   For,as Americans have pointed out, amount of trafficpassing along any route is not measured by the numberof ships required for its protection.     I submit these reflections for your considerationbut I fear it is now too late for mc to receive further instructions before the close of this session.   i must be allowed to expx-ess my regret that the cabinet have found It impossible to do more than repeat to mopurely negative criticism of the Admiralty-,   I had hoped that they might have been able to supply me withsome positive and constructive suggestions which wouldhave enabled me at least to Lay the basis of agreement.     It is very unfortunate that this apparently becomesimpossible .just at the moment when as reported in my telegram Ioa 56 French Cabinet had unanimously reachedthe opinion that they must seek agreement with us.
