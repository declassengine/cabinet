[This Document is  the  Property  of  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Government.]                      Printed for the Cabinet.    June 1028.SECRET.   CP.  200 (28).                 INDIAN  STATUTORY  COMMISSION.   I circulate  for  the  information  of  the  Cabinet a copy  of a telegram from  the-Viceroy in which he suggests inter  alia, the possibility of so amending the  royal warrant as to permit the co-option of Indians to the Commission, and of my reply.   In regard to the question of abrogating the reservation, made by  the Chairman ofthe Commission in his published letter of 6th February, of  the right to take evidence in camera if necessary^ I am  in consultation with Sir J. Simon.     INDIA OFFICE,                                              BIRKENHEAD.        22nd June 1928.                   Telegram from Viceroy, dated 13th June 1928.   363  S.   Private  and  personal.   I  wrote to  you  by mail  of 9th  June full account of  the proposal that Chimanlal Setalvad had made to me in  connection withthe boycott; but, for considerations  of time which I will develop later, 1 think thatthe matter  is of sufficient importance  to place fully before you by telegram.   2. When he was here in connection with the Jain affair, he came to see me aboutthe boycott, and  developed at some  length the position of  himself,and his  friends.The upshot was that they fully realise that the Parliamentary Commission must stand,and that it would carry out its function, boycott or no boycott.   They were  not blindto the damage the boycott might inflict upon the Indian case as presented to  theCommission ;  but were principally concerned with the extent to which the atmospherein which any revision of the constitution would fall to be launched must be prejudicedif the present situation continues.  They were not very happy with their Swarajist allies ;.but, in. default of something being clone which they could  utilise as plausible reasonfor co-operation, it was  quite impossible for  the  more  reasonable elements to breakaway.  I told, him  that lie must clearly understand that  both the main proposals-which had  been made to secure  full equality of status, namely (1)  reconstitution ofthe Commission, and (2) the creation of a parallel Royal Commission, were impossible the first, because Parliament must be assumed to have taken its decision deliberately,,for reasons which seemed to  Bis Majesty&apos;s Government and  Parliament adequate ;the second, because it was obviously  impracticable.  I further  told  him that, while Ishould be  of course glad to hear any  proposals he might have to make, it was no goodsuggesting anything to impair the  responsibility of Simon&apos;s  Commission to make-their own  report,   He recognised  this, and finally suggested that it might be possibleto meet the views of many who had felt bound under present conditions to associate themselves  with  the   boycott by  an  amendment of   the Royal  Warrant.  Thetwo things which were essential,  from his point of view, were to enhance the status of the Indian Committees and abrogate Simon&apos;s restriction on  their  hearing evidence-and seeing papers.  I told him that if he liked to put on paper the kind of amendmenthe had in  mind, 1 would certainly examine it, but he  must clearly appreciate that the-question of the terms of the Warrant, and of in camera  evidence, were matters whollyoutside my competence.    3. I  have given you more fully in my letter the details of our talk, and  extent to-which I felt  able to go, in conversation with him a few days later.  He left with  mefollowing  draft, which he wished  to insert  immediately  before  paragraph beginning-:&apos;- And  we  do by these presents   will and  ordain that this,  our Commission, shall continue in full force and virtue &quot; :     &quot; And  we do by these presents authorise and empower you to co-opt seven persons whose  names may have been  recommended by  Central  Legislature of India to  be associated with  you throughout  in  your  enquiries and deliberations.  And we  do-further  ordain  that  the seven persons so co-opted have liberty separately to report to us under their hands and seals, or under the hands and  seals of any three or more of them, their opinion upon matters herein submitted for your consideration.      2873   75  6.28
   &quot; And we do  by  these  presents  authorise  and  empower you,  when you  areprosecuting your  enquiries in any Province, to  co-opt  seven persons whose namesmay have  been recommended by  the  Legislative Council  of  such Province  to  be associated with you in your enquiries and deliberations regarding such Province.&quot;   On  this I wrote  to tell  him that the words &quot; and deliberations &quot; were clearlyimpossible, and that for two reasons :  first, that the Commission, as Indian Committeewould no  doubt also desire  to do, must retain full liberty of deliberation among themselves;  and, second,  that  it was certain Commission would not finish its workbefore leaving India  after next cold weather, and would probably find  it necessary tocontinue  investigation of some  matters and   deliberate  upon  them after returnto England before settling down to write their  Report.   I accordingly gave him tounderstand that, if these words remained, I  could go no further in the matter,  butthat,  provided he were willing to substitute for the  words in his draft &quot; throughoutyour  enquiries and deliberations&quot; the  following:  &quot; throughout your enquiries  inIndia,&quot; I would  transmit his proposal to you  for your consideration.   4. I have just heard from him to say that he  recognises that each side must have full discretion as to separate deliberation, though he expects understanding should bethat, in the event contemplated, there would still be much common consultation, andthat the two  wings would  work in closest harmony..  He accordingly agrees to abandon the   words  &quot; and  deliberations.&quot;   He  will  not,  however, agree   to   limit  the.association of Indian  Committee to enquiries in  India, as I had suggested.   He says that, from  the Indian point of view, it is  essential that  they should not be  denied theopportunity of forming their judgment on the issues arising, and in the light of  thematerial submitted, at your end, nor indeed  -could Central Indian Committee write areport without such opportunity.   He adds that he could not hope to carry his friendsunless such opportunity were afforded.   5. The following seem to be the vital elements in reaching a decision upon  theabove proposal:              fJ   First, that the actual  purport of the  proposal  should be clearly apprehended inrelation to the procedure  which at present holds  the field.    Second, the advantages to be anticipated  from the proposal, including  the degree to which the proposal would be likely to yield results in the way of terminating thepresent agitation.    Third,  the objections that must be weighed against it.   I take these in order.    G. The effective purport  seems  to me threefold :     (a) The Indian Committees are accorded status of co-opted  members  instead of,in Simon &apos;s phrase, being associated with Commission in &quot; joint free conference.&quot;  This,provided they are not permitted to  sign the Report, and provided necessity of separate deliberation  is recognised, seems to be a question rather of form than of substance. Moreover, the  principle of co-option without the right to sign Report has been not uncommon practice in recent years.    (6) The Central Indian Committee is accorded the right to make its report direct to the  King instead  of,  as  at present proposed by Simon, having it included as an appendix  to his Report.   Method by  which Report  is given official publicity seems again question of form, though point  is one to  which great importance attaches in  a controversy where sentiment plays so large a part.    (c) The  proposed  amendment tacitly  abrogates  in camera evidence.    Simon would,  of course, have   power, in  exercise of which I  am satisfied he need  not apprehend difficulty, of   protecting witnesses  under examination, and there  would be no  objection to exclusion of Press if it  seemed desirable  to clo so.   Personally, I have never  felt  that,  so long as  these powers are  exercised, there was  any serious objection to all material being seen and all evidence being heard by  Indian wing.   I have always been of opinion that Simon and his colleagues would get  the hang of things in many other ways, and  probably more effectively, than through formal evidence and official papers ; they  will not lack  opportunity for whatever private conversation of an informal kind they may desire, and I clo not anticipate that they would, in  practice, find  themselves  hampered  in obtaining  information by abandonment  of the discretionary power to take evidence apart from Indian wing. It seems  reasonable to  hold that, if  members of  Services, and  particularly those serving under Ministers, could be  confident of  protection by  Chairman and were aware that Press  might be excluded,  they  would  not- be  deterred from  giving
3 his Q-evidence.   Whole, force  of Indian  attack  at present is  directed against  what is represented as gratuitous hurt to Indian  self-respect and  measure of unfair discrimination -mation to their detriment.  In this matter I have considerable sympathy with Indianfeeling, based  on apprehensions that their  characteristics and  achievements may be^subjected  to unfair  and partisan attacks by individuals,  which they will  have no-opportunity of meetiug.  1 would ask you to judge this,  for instance,  from the pointof view  of Ministers who, while friendly to the Government,  are not unnaturallyapprehensive of this provision,  but wdiose close sympathy with the work  of  theCommission it is very necessary for us to secure.   7. The  advantages to be anticipated  from proposal may be summarised,  I think,.as follows ;      (a) Everything depends upon  extent to which, if you and Simon were disposed toconsider the idea  favourably, the proposal would  in fact deliver  substantial goods.I could have wished  to have  had someone other than  Setaivad to deal with,  but one cannot,  choose one&apos;s  instrument  according  to one&apos;s own preference,  and I  did  notthink it right, as the  opportunity came through him, to leave it unexamined.   He hasconsiderable influence in Bombay and with Liberals generally.   He told me  that hecould not,  of course,  commit his friends  without consultation.   He would accept ithimself.   He had no doubt of his Bombay  friends like Purshottamdas Thakurdas or-of the other Liberals in Bengal, or such as Sivaswamy  Aiyar or Rangachariar  inMadras.   He  felt pretty sure he could  get Jayakar in on this ; also, for what he isworth, Jinnah, and hoped  at  least to reduce Sapru  to neutrality.  The Justice partyin Madras,  who - are  at present rather wobbly, would, he thought, also  come in prettysolid.  This is necessarily largely conjecture, though my information leads me to much the  same  conclusion, a.nd  I should  anticipate that, once a wedge wras inserted, itwould tend to widen.  But facts as to results  of this kind would need  to be definitelyascertained, and I return to this point later.    (b) Assuming  that political results  were substantial,  there  seem to me veryweighty arguments  in favour of  giving  the  matter  very careful  and,  I think,favourable  consideration.  In spite  of the  difficulties  experienced by all parties  tothe conference, I do not think, as  things are, we can  anticipate any  serious diminutionin  force of the  opposition.   We shall no  doubt carry  motions for Committees  in several of  the Provincial Councils, though it is probable that we  shall do so by narrowmajorities, and  only by help of official  votes.   This  may mean that ProvincialCommittees will not be as  representative  as  we should desire, and  that their constitution may  not  escape criticism that  wall, in  the circumstances,  be  notunmerited.  We shall almost certainly, as things are, be forced  to consider replacing the  proposed Committee of Central Legislature  by  some  other  device, unless, which seems to me on the whole an  undesirable issue, we went  back  to the  Assembly, wonby a narrow margin, and found ourselves left to elect from an unrepresentative rump.    (c) I foresee, moreover, that we  shall have  increasing difficulty with ProvincialCommittees over the question of in camera evidence.  The  Punjab has already set an example in this respect, which is not likely to be lost on  other provinces, and I shallnot  be surprised, from  what  I hear of the general position in provinces, to see anyProvincial Council carrying an amendment to Government motion for a Committee tothe effect that they will appoint provided that they are permitted to hear the evidence on equal terms.  And the question will loom, larger  even than it  does at present as we get nearer the time.    (d) But I am even more concerned with the situation that is likely to prevail whenthe  result  of Simon&apos;s labours comes to  be put into  operation.   1 am not, I think.disposed to overrate the importance  politically, but  it  is  a mistake not less great tounderrate  the damage which  it is in the  power of an  admitted  minority  to effect in the  general temper and condition of political  India  with wdiich we have to work.It would be in the highest  degree unfortunate that whatever proposals  Simon maymake should be launched in an atmosphere of such universal hostility that they wouldhave few or no friends amongst organised political parties.  It is worth a great deal,if vre can do it without impairing the main  structure of our scheme, to  avoid  thisaggravation of the problem.     S.  I will now take the objections, which I do not underrate :     (a) The technical difficulty of the amendment of the Warrant is considerable, but-can  no doubt be surmounted, and 1 would hope  that, if the change commends itself-on other grounds, the King would give his approval to such amendment being made.
   ;(6) The objiec-tion to  the  abrogation of  in camera  evidence I have  already discussed.   (c) The consideration  that -weighs  most heavily with me, as, I doubt not, it will&apos;with you and Simon, is  that of modifying the proposals after the various pronounce--  tents that have been  made  in  the opposite sense.   But I  think it  would berecognised that we had maintained our substantial position, and that the modification in this respect  was  evidence of the desire  to remove  what appeared otherwiseinevitable  misunderstandings.  Moreover, as I have already said, we  are  likely to be -more and more up against this question even in co-operating provinces.   (d) I have  also reflected carefully upon the  possibility of  attacks from our friendsthat we are yielding to the clamour of our enemies.   This might no doubt be said but I am  satisfied that on the whole  our friends would welcome  the&apos;.change, at least as regards in camera evidence, not less than others, and  one of the Bengal.  Moslems,who has stood by us throughout, went out of his way to tell me a few days ago that,.if any way could be found of easing the  position of those whom he had opposed, he-would have no objection.   (e) I appreciate the  difficulty which  you and  Simon  may feel as to  extendingassociation of Indian Committee with him to include  enquiries pursued in England,but I understand from your  letter dated  24th May  that Commission will  have had agood deal of informal conArersation with members of your Office during this summer,and  will, no doubt,  in the same way be able  to supplement in private  intercoursewhatever  formal sittings  they  might hold  on  return to  England  next year, for the-purpose of obtaining for themselves and Indian Committee what might be regardedas official  evidence.   Generally, as regards gist of  official  evidence before  IndianCommittees, your Office  and  Government  of  India will be in similar  position, but Ithink that  our difficulties need not be  deemed insuperable.   9.  In the  event of your  being willing,  after  consultation with  Simon, to giveconditional approval to the idea, I shall have to consider carefully the  best method of&apos;satisfying ourselves  upon the degree  of support it  would  be  likely to command.  considered  very carefully whether  it was  wiser  to  let  Setalvad begin by  taking -informal soundings before I  knew  your mind, or whether it was  not, on the  Avhole,..better to  begin by  ascertaining your views.  1 had no doubt that, in  a matter where -every course  presents difficulty, the course  open to the  least objection and the most likely to avoid publicity  was  to take your judgment in the first instance ; leaving to alater stage, if necessary, the  business of  satisfying  ourselves precisely what  politicalresult the  proposal could  promise.  I have, therefore, pledged Setalvad to secrecy a pledge which Mulla, who knows him  intimately, says that he can  be  relied  upon to -observe.    10. I would not be satisfied unless I  could obtain written  assurances of support from a selected number  of persons, whose  adherence would  be likely to  be  decisive -in favour of the proposal.  I  would instance Sapru, Jayakar  and  Panagal in Madras.I also regard  it  as very necessary, if  not essential,  that the adherence of Jinnah, nowin  England,  should be  secured.   He has  great  capacity for mischief.  I  think,..however, that it would be dangerous to broach the  matter to  Jinnah unless and-until we have secured sufficiently  influential assurances of support  out here.    11. When the proposal was made to these persons, it would  have to be madeexplicit- that  in substance the  proposal must be  taken or  rejected as it  stands, andthat it must not  be assumed that the Warrant would be liable to further modification.    12. On the balance, my mind  is  clear.   If we could  get substantial  results by this  means,  I should  feel  that we had  obtained,  them -without any  sacrifice of essentials, and I hope, therefore, that you and Simon  will share my view.  If you clo, . I should  be glad  of an  indication  of your views, and,  if you felt  able  to give it, authority  to  carry  matters  a stage further.  In the event  of our moving  on these lines, I should be glad  to get matters settled as  early as possible if they are to be settled on these lines at all.  Bengal Council meets on  9th July.   I do  not think there is anything substantial in  the letter referred to in para. 1 that is not repeated here ; though I  hope that when  you read  it you will agree that in  my conversation with  Setalvad. I was not unsuccessful in preserving just balance between the desire to explore the possibilities  of his proposal and the  necessity of  maintaining intact what I conceive to be the essential framework of our scheme.    I  have discussed with Hailey and Crerar, who concur in this telegram.
         Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 20th June 1928.   1722.   Private and  personal.  Your private and  personal  telegram dated 13fchJune.  Simon Commission.  I am dealing separately with  question of  in  cameraevidence.   As regards proposed amendment of Royal Warrant to permit co-option and separate report, I am advised by Home Office authorities on Royal Commissions thatthis is impracticable, and that  only  method of empowering persons  other than those already appointed members of this Commission  to  be  associated on an equal footing with the Commission in its main enquiry and of reporting to the King would be tohave a fresh warrant appointing them members of the  Commission.   I fear, therefore,that proposal falls to the ground.   But apart from technical difficulty, I should have felt it impossible to recommend it to Cabinet who would  have had to be consulted.   It seems  to me to go far  beyond any  mere  formal concession and  to create in  effect  two  co-equal  Commissionssubmitting two independent reports.  When I said in House of Lords that we couldnot have this  it was not a mere flourish.   There is a vital principle involved, viz.undivided  responsibility  of Parliament, which  both Prime  Minister and I insistedmust be maintained.  Moreover, this  plan  seems  to me to involve  in an intensifiedform all the disadvantages and none of the advantages of a mixed  Commission.   I do not, therefore, think that Cabinet would have  entertained proposal.   In anycase they would have asked what change has  occurred in situation since Commissionleft to cause us to make it, and this I should have  found it very difficult to tell them.For proposal is, in fact,  designed primarily  to ameliorate not existing situation, butsituation which may confront an unknown scheme in an unknown future two or threeyears hence ; and while I am fully alive to the dangers I do not believe that anythingwe can  do now will avert them.  Moreover, Setalvad, as you recognise, is not a manwhose advocacy of a course inspires confidence in it.   I have entered into merits of question at some  length  because  I want to dissuadeyou from pursuing this line of thought further.  Do not think  that I do not sympathise with your anxieties,  but I am convinced that Simon&apos;s letter of 6th February is as faras Cabinet are prepared to go.  I have not consulted  Simon because this is reallyCabinet question  in  which he is not  primarily  concerned.   Technical objection is, Ipresume, sufficient answer to Setalvad.   I will reply as soon as possible about  in  camera  evidence which 1 am  discussing with Simon.2873
