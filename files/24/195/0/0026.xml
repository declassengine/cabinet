JAPANESE AIR  BASE AT  FORMOSA AND BRITISH AIR BASE                             AT HONG KONG.                           (C.I.D. Paper No. 311-C.)      (Previous Reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 233rd Meeting, Minute 2.) *    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air covering a Memorandum by the  Air Staff in regard to the Japanese Air Base at Formosa (C.I.D. Paper No. 311-C),    THE PRIME MINISTER reminded  the  Committee that  this question  had come up for consideration at the 233rd Meeting, which was held on the 16th February. last, when a decision was postponed &quot; until such time as the  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had had an opportunity to examine the matter further.&quot;    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN stated that the Foreign Office did not think that the case for protesting  against the Japanese Air Base was  a very strpng  one, and further, that, if a protest were made, the J apanese might  retaliate by examining the situation at Hong Kong. In these circumstances the Foreign Office thought  it would be advisable to let the matter rest as it stood.    SIR SAMUEL LIOARE said that  when the subject was  under consideration previously, he had pointed  out that in his view  the arguments for  and  against. lodging a protest with the Japanese were very evenly balanced.  He was, therefore,. inclined to concur with the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary.  In his  opinion it would be to our advantage to have a free hand to instal air  defences at Hong Kong, which could be justified on the grounds that they were required for purposes of defence against landward  attack.  He gathered that the Foreign Secretary agreed that we should be free to station an air unit in the island.    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN concurred with this  view provided  that  it was the case that the air units at Hong Kong  were not an  addition to the Coast Defences, and that we should be able to  substantiate our position in this matter  if it were taken to arbitration.    SIR HUGH TRENCHARD reminded the Committee that the British Govern- ment had advised the Japanese and  the United States  Governments that,  having regard to the situation in China,  we proposed to establish an  aerodrome in Hong Kong.  To this the Japanese  had replied  that they entertained no objection provided that the base was a purely temporary one.  Questions in regard  to  the  defence of Hong Kong were constantly being raised, and the share to be taken by the Air Force in these defences could not be determined until  the position  vis-a-vis the Japanese had been decided.    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN thought  that it would be advisable  to baseour  action on the  Japanese  agreement in spite of its temporary character without raising the matter afresh, as it seemed likely that the situation in China would not become normal for some time to come.   At the same time, it was important to know whether  the proposals in regard to air units at Hong Kong did, in fact, constitute an increase to the  Coast Defences.  He gathered  that the Secretary of State for Air did  not regard  them as such an increase, while the Chief  of the Air Staff  held  acontrary view.  ,    [17706-1]
    SIR SAMUEL HOARE pointed out  that the  necessity  for  an air unit at hong Kong was dependent largely upon the development of the Japanese  Air base at Formosa, and that the two aspects of coast defence and defence against landwardattack hung together.  He would be opposed to giving up the right to protest againstthe Japanese Air Base at Formosa if no advantage was going to accrue to us thereby.It seemed to him that if the Japanese were to be permitted to develop their base atFormosa we should be  equally free to develop an air  base at Hong Kong.  Theostensible reason given by the Japanese for  their base at Formosa was that it was required for police purposes.  Could we not employ the same argument in the case of hong Kong ?    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that  he was inclined to agree that weshould be free to develop an air base at Hong Kong, and that, if at some future date, we were taken before a Court of Arbitration on this  question, we could raiseat the same time the case of the Japanese base at  Formosa.  If, therefore, the AirMinistry was prepared to  develop the base  for purposes of defence against land-ward attack, he would raise no objections.                            CONCLUSIONS.THE. COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed to recommend to the Cabinet: (a.) That no protest should be made at the present time against the establish-      ment of a Japanese air base at Formosa.(b.) That the development of an air base at Hong Kong was not likely to raise      difficulties at the  present time as the  Japanese had acquiesced in&apos; its  ;    establishment as an emergency measure  during the present abnormal      situation in China, which might continue for some time.(c.) That, apart from  this temporary justification of our action, the develop-      ment of a base  on the mainland, not specifically for coast defence, but      for purposes of defence against landward  attack, can be defended as      constituting  no  infringement  of the Washington Treaty,id:) That if,  at  some future date, protests  were raised and the matter were      taken before a Court of Arbitration, it would be right for us to protest at      the  same time  against  the establishment of a Japanese air base at      Formosa.(e.) That on this understanding the policy of the establishment of an Air Base      at Hong Kong should be approved.      ik           -y-          Jfc          4fc        &apos;   *afe           -v?      ^           *7t-          w          &quot;JV           ^7V*           -Jv2, Whitehall Gardens, S: W. 1,       May 22, 1928.

January 1928.SECRET,311-C.Copy  No.69COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  THE  JAPANESE AIR BASE IN  FORMOSA.    I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of the Committee of ImperialDefence, a memorandum by the Air Staff on the question  of the Japanese air base at Formosa in relation to air developments at Hong Kong.    This  question has been under  discussion  inter-departmentally for  some time past, and is now, by agreement between the Foreign Office and  the Service  depart-ments,  referred for consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence.Air Ministry, January 28, 1928.MEMORANDUM BY THE AIR STAFF ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE JAPANESE AIR BASE                                 IN FORMOSA.    1.  In June 1927 it was finally accepted, as had been foreseen for the previoustwo years, that the Japanese had established an air base in Formosa.    2.  The Air  Ministry invited  the views of the Foreign Office on this develop-ment, and the Foreign Office, as the outcome of the correspondence attached heretoas Enclosures 1 to 5, have asked that the matter should be referred to the Committeeof Imperial Defence.    3.  The  Air Staff desire to offer the  following  remarks on the strategicalsignificance to Great Britain of the establishment by Japan of either ,air forces orflying facilities in, or on the coast of,  Formosa.    4.  Either the presence  of aircraft  or  the  provision of flying  facilities atFormosa in time of peace lessens British security  in the Far East in the followingrespects :                                         -      (i.) Hong Kong would be liable to direct attack  at long range from land or          coastal air bases in Formosa.     (ii.) The sea routes along which the  British Navy must pass from their base          at Hong Kong to operate in the seas near Japan or Northern China, and          which  British convoys in  these waters must also use,  would be within          range of shore-based air attack.    (iii.) Under cover of the air establishment maintained  in peace,  it would be          possible to concentrate, ready for immediate use on the outbreak of war,          extensive facilities capable of  maintaining a much larger force of air-          craft in operation,  or  equally, of refuelling rapidly  large numbers of          aircraft for onward passage.    (iv.) Formosa is itself within a range of 900 miles of Japan following the chain          of the numerous islands; and, with adequate organisation and training,          it  would be possible for aircraft to reach  Formosa from Japan  under          their own power.MEMORANDUM BY  THE SECRETARY OF  STATE  FOR AIR.(Initialled)S. H.[17119]B
      (v.) From Formosa it is  a flight of under  150 miles to the Chinese mainland           north-east of Hong Kong and, with  the flying facilities which could be           prepared in Formosa, it would thus be  possible to  move aircraft in a           short  space of time from  Japan to improvised landing  grounds and           sheltered waters on the  Chinese coast.   Thus, the effect of the develop-           ment of  flying facilities in Formosa would be to enable the Japanese to           establish, in a much shorter time after the outbreak of war  than they           otherwise could, improvised  air bases on the-Chinese coast from which           to carry  out an air offensive against Hong Kong.                Such an operation would have for its objects                     (a) the destruction of the  naval base  installations at  Hong                        Kong;  (6)  the complete or partial denial of the use of the                        sheltered water in  Hong Kong harbour  to the  British                        Fleet  for refuelling.                In view of  the difficulty to the Japanese of  achieving  these objects           by means of a. military landing, within the period of time available before           the arrival of a superior British Fleet  (some six weeks), an attempt to           achieve them by the easier means of an air operation might prove more           attractive.   The commitment involved, moreover, would be less,  in that           the aircraft and skilled personnel could, for the most part,  be  evacuated           by air  if the operation were abandoned.                It will be readily appreciated that  any reduction which could  be           effected in  the length of  the time necessary to establish such improvised           air bases on the Chinese coast has considerable significance;  and  the           development of  extensive flying facilities at  Formosa, which  would  be           possible under the cover  afforded by peace air stations, might  so reduce           this  period as to give the operation a  greatly enhanced chance of success.                It is not suggested that  under present conditions the concentration           of aircraft on the Chinese coast from Japan under their own power is an           operation that is already feasible. If, however, the Japanese decided that           it was  desirable to be in a position  to carry out this operation, they  could           make it feasible, and would be able to  proceed to do so from now onwards           without our having the right to interfere.    5.  During the previous  consideration of this  subject  there has  been muchdiscussion whether the British Empire, stands to gain most      (a)  by objecting to the development by the Japanese of an air base at  Formosa,           recognising that as a consequence we may  be  precluded  from taking           similar action at Hong Kong; or (b) by allowing the Japanese to proceed           at Formosa without protest, with the intention  of ourselves developing           an air base at Hong Kong.    Whilst,  however,  these two alternative  courses  of action were  still  underdiscussion, events in China made it necessary for  us to  station air  units at HongKong..    6.  The  Foreign  Office, therefore, notified  the  United  States and Japan by telegram of our intention as regards Hong Kong (copies of these communications,together  with the replies received,  are  attached as  Enclosures 6 to 10).  Japanreplied favourably,  with the  proviso that the occupation was to be a temporary measure  and not  a  permanent  increase  of  the Hong Kong defences.  The UnitedStates accepted the notification without comment.    Afterwards, as stated in paragraph 1 above,  it was confirmed that the japanese were proceeding to strengthen their air garrison in Formosa and to instal permanentflying facilities.    7.  In these circumstances, the  following courses of  action  appear to be  opento us:      (i.)  We could open the question by  pointing out that at the time when the 8th           Japanese Wing  went to  Formosa, our units at Hong Kong were  there           on a temporary footing only, and proceed to enquire whether the air base           at Heito  is  also to be of a temporary nature only.
     (ii.)  We might take the second of the alternatives indicated in the Air Ministry           letter of the 9th June,  1927 (Enclosure, 1),  and reserve a similar freedom           of action for ourselves at Hong Kong.                Should this course be adopted, the Japanese might argue that their           air units in Formosa are employed for police purposes in peace, whereas           any units of ours to be located, at Hong Kong would be there for war           purposes only.                We could, however, rejoin that our  own units at Hong Kong were           also maintained for police purposes.     8.   On the assumption, therefore,  that the view taken by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 202nd Meeting on the 27th July, 1925, endorsing the report of the Chiefs of Staff on this question, still holds, and  that the further expansion of the Japanese air station at Formosa, which has taken place since, that date, could be regarded as constituting a breach of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Air  Staff attach importance  to an early decision on the main issue of principle, viz,,:      (a.)  Should we refrain from making  any representations to the Japanese as           regards their activities in Formosa in order to enable us to proceed with           the development of an  air base at Hong Kong?               or alternatively     (b.)  Should we enter a protest and demand the removal by the Japanese of  their           air base and units from Formosa, accepting the consequence that it will           not in future be possible to send British  air units to Hong Kong except           as a purely temporary measure in an emergency,  such as the present           situation in China ?     9.  The Air Staff have in the past inclined  from  the  purely strategical aspectto the opinion that, if it is  feasible,  the balance of  advantage lies with the latter course, viz., that air bases should be prohibited alike at Formosa and Hong Kong.     They appreciate, however, that important political considerations are involvedwhich may make this course impracticable, and that  it is in particular necessary totake into account the fact that both the Japanese and the United States  authoritiesare reported to have expressed the view, that the Japanese action at Formosa does notcontravene Article XIX of the treaty.     10.  Accordingly, while still preferring that there should be no air bases either at Formosa or at Hong Kong, the Air Staff  are of opinion that, if this is ruled outby recent developments, we should insist on having the power to make an  air base at hong Kong.     In conclusion, they would point out that, even if it were generally agreed that,to conform to the Washington Treaty, there should  be no military air base either at Formosa or at Hong Kong, it would still  be essential to provide an aerodrome atthe latter place for civil purposes  and to enable service aircraft to be sent there todeal with emergencies similar  to those which have recently  arisen in China.     Air Staff, January 26, 1928.(S.20902/S.6.)                    Enclosure 1.(Secret.)Sir,                                               Air Ministry, June 9,  1927.   &apos; I am commanded by the Air Council to refer  to  previous correspondence inconnection with air  developments at Formosa,  and in particular to their letter ofthe 18th December, 1926.    The Air Council have lately received a copy of a report prepared by the military attache at Tokio in  regard to the Japanese Army Estimates for 1927-28, in which appear  items (a) of 100,000 Yen for new buildings for units in Formosa, and (b) of1,043,904 Yen for expenditure in respect of air services (military) in Formosa,  Thesefigures  indicate that the Japanese Government  are  proceeding with their policy for the strengthening of the air garrison of the island.

    The Air  Council  would be  glad  to  be informed whether,  in  view of theseindications, Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain proposes that any negotiations withthe Japanese  Government on  this  subject  should  be initiated, or whether  thealternative should be adopted of (a) accepting the implied contention of the JapaneseGovernment that their developments at Formosa are in no way inconsistent with their obligations under the Washington Treaty, and  (&amp;) of thereby&apos; retaining a similarfreedom of action as regards any measures of air provision which may be requiredfor the defence of Hong Kong.

In the latter case, Japanese fear that corresponding increase might be made inPhilippines or elsewhere by America.
