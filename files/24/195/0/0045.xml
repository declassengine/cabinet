MEMORANDUM BY  THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.   -     I circulate, for the information of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a memorandum-on the above subject prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.                                                                     L. W.-E.  THE  WAR OFFICE,             June, 1928.                                1. THE NEW LAWS.     After months of discussion in the French Parliament the following basic kws, dealing with the reorganization of the Army, have been passed and promulgated :      The Law for the general organization of the Army, which  lays  down the  general            lines on which the Army is to be constituted.     The Recruiting Law, which deals with conscription and reserve service.     Law of Cadres and Effectives, which lays down the number of formations and units,            and peace establishments.     The non-Commissioned Officers&apos; Charter,  which provides better conditions of service            for long service NTon-coramissioned Officers.     The Laws themselves only state the  general  principles on which the Army will be organized,  but  a  mass  of detailed information, regarding  the  actual  effectives/and distribution  of the  Army,  has been  published  in   the  reports  of  the numerous Parliamentary Commissions which discussed and amended the laws.                       2.  REASONS  FOB  THE RE-ORGANIZATION.     The arguments for Army reform were as follows :      The shortage  of  man-power  in French  industry, leading to a political demand            for a reduction in  the period of conscript  service from 18 months to 1 year.     (b)  The  need  for  cutting down  the  number  of  formations  and  units,  which            could not be kept up to strength with the  present white annual contingent            of  250,000.     (c)  The lack of a Colonial Expeditionary Force of long service soldiers.  In 1925         ;.. practically untrained  white conscripts had to be sent overseas to deal with            the risings in Syria and Morocco.     (d)  The bad state of training in the  French Army,, due  partly to the weakness of            units but principally to  the  short time (8 months) spent in actual  military-            training, the remainder  being taken  up by clerial and other administrative            duties in the garrisons.                                               ...                  3. MAIN CHANGES UNDER THE RE-ORGANIZATION.     The following are the main changes introduced :      ;.:-     (a)  A reduction of. the 30 infantry divisions stationed in  France and  the Rhinelandto 26.   The essential changes in organization and establishments have been in progressibr some months.                                               .\(B28/18)  60  6/28  W.O.P.  3714TMs document is the property sf His Britannic Majesty^ Gcverament.
     (b) The enlistment of the following additional long service personnel : -     36,000 additional white long service non-commissioned officers.     15,060 additional Gardes Republicaines,  mobile gendarmerie for  guard and  police               duties.     15,000 Agents Militaires, to  act as clerks and administrative personnel.     10,000 civilian employees, to relieve serving soldiers from domestic duties.     (c) The formation in  France of an. Expeditionary Force of 5  North African and Colonial native divisions, mainly  composed of long service personnel.     (d)  A reduction of conscript service with the&apos; Soldi!?s for whites from 18 mobths to 1 year.  This is dependent on success in obtaining the additional  long service personnel referred to under (b)  above. It is hoped to effect this  change  for the contingent  called to the colours in  November, 1929.   The age for conscript service is being gradually raised from 20 to 21.                               4. PERIODS  OP SERVICM.     The period of conscript service for white personnel is to be as  follows :-          With the colours      ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    1 year          En  disponibilite (e.g., liable to recall  without  the  order  for              mobilization having been given)       ...     ...     ..-    3 years          1st  Reserve  ...      ...    ...     ...     ...     ...     ...   16 years          2nd Reserve ...      ...     ...     ...     ...     ...     ...    8 years                       Total military liability       ...     ...     ...  28 years     The period of conscript service for native  troops is  3 years with the colours and  12with the reserve, except in  Algeria, where conscript coldur service is for 2 years only.                            5-.  IMPROVEMENTS  IN TRAINING.     The laws contain provisions for improving :-     Pre-military training of youths ; &amp; special  law dealing with this subject is to be laid         before Parliament:     The training of  the annual contingent of conscripts  :     The training of&apos; Reserve Officers and  Reserve non-commissioned officers during their         coldur service :     The training of  reservists.     Reserve officers  are liable to  periods of training up to a maximum of 4 months during their reserve service ;  they can also carry out voluntary courses.     Each reservist is  to carry out training as Mibws &apos;:          Eh disponibilite&apos;      ...   1 training of 3 weeks.         1st Reserve  ...     ...   2 trainings,. 1 of 3 Weeks, and 1 d! 2 or 3 weeks.         2nd Reserve ...     ...   1 tr&apos;aifiibg of 7 day&apos;s.

\.    (a). Forces  to  be  maintained, in France and  Rhineland in peace.-(i)  Twenty^onecorps headquartei&apos;s  (20 corps regions and the colonial corps).     Twenty-six infantry divisions, comprising :                f 6 reinforced infantry divisions,:each of  9,  battalions (for eastern frontier  Forces du       corps regions).   Units in these divisions are on a higher establishment.

No  definite organization for a cavalry division  is  laid down  in  the laws, ascavalry organization is in a state of flux.     (iii)  Three air divisions. The maximum  number of  army  air squadrons  is  notlaid down in  the laws.  The Freuch Government are thus able to increase the strength ofthe air arm - by  decree, as  personnel  and material become available.  The original billenvisaged 136 squadrons in place of the existing 132.     (iv)  Units of the General Reserve, which in war are allotted byG.H.Q. to formationsas required.     (v) Garrisons of the fortified regions.     (b) Overseas garrisons. There  is no  change in  the main distribution of Frenchoverseas garrisons.  A large  proportion, 7- infantry divisions and 3 mixed brigades, are stationed in North Africa.   These formations  correspond  more  to military districts inIndia than to war formations.     (c) Peace Establishments and Distribution  are given  in Appendix A.                     7. MOBILIZATION AND  EXPANSION FOE  WAR.     (a) General.  The reforms aim at providing      (i) An adequate covering force in the frontier regions in  peace.    (ii) The rapid  expansion of the active  Army on  mobilization, to provide a  screen           behind which the Nation in Arms can mobilize in security.     (b)  The Covering Force (La Couverture). In principle one white infantry divisionis raised and stationed in peace in each Corps region, and the total of 20 white infantry divisions cannot be exceeded.     To provide the covering  force on  the Rhine, the Laws state  that certain Corpsregions may in peace have their divisions withdrawn and stationed  in  the Rhineland orthe  frontier  Corps  regions.    The so-called Regions  vides will  be those,  in the west of France.     For the present, 4 infantry divisions will thus be stationed outside  their. territorialregions, and allotted to the Rhine Army.  After the  evacuation, the 3 Corps  regions onthe German frontier will each be strengthened by a division on the higher establishment,drawn from the interior.                                                              ,.,     As a temporary measure the Rhineland divisions are grouped in two Corps a^Armeede Marche.     The covering force on  the  Italian frontier is assured by the two higher establishmentAlpine divisions.  .  &apos;                                                  -          ,r     (c) Mobilization machinery in peace. -Active units  of  the standing army (Forces.Fermanentes) are- freed under  the reforms  from all duties connected  with  mobilization..These are to  be carried out by 450 mobilization centres,, staffed mainly by Agents Militaires,&quot;with a small staff of regular officers and long-service non-commissioned officers.     ...     These centres will carry out all administrative work in connection with  mobilization,,     (3714)
airireg&amp;rds&apos;the provision of personnel and animals, and the&apos; stot/agefand mainteriEbice ofmaterial.   On mobilization, thV reserve units will actually be formed at the centr^s.!^  &apos;  &apos;     To provide continuity, each region cbnimahder has ih peace two staffs&quot;   &apos; &apos;-&apos; 1    (i)  An active category; available! for the mobilized higher formation in war.     (ii)  A  territorial category; -available  for the staffs remaining in the  interior.on-            mobilization.     s-;      5&quot;       &quot;                 &quot;  1      &apos; v.:-;The region  commander  exercises in peace both the command  of - the troops in the region, and the  territorial  command.  He may be  designated to command a corps onmobilization ; in this case he is  replaced in  command of the  region by a general officerselected and prepared for this duty in peace.     (d) Mobilization procedure. The 3 disponible  classes can be called  up at any time without issuing the order to mobilize.                                  S     The 1.6 classes of the 1st reserve join  the colours  immediately the  mobilization oftheif class  is ordered.     The 8 classes of the 2nd reserve are called up individually on mobilization.     (e)  Expansion for  War. The following figures are taken from the debates in theFrench Chamber, and the mobilization time-table can only be taken as approximate.              (i)  Mobilization of the Active Divisions.   (Forces Permanentes.)             &apos;  .:, The 20 white active divisions are mobilized  by calling  up the 3 disponible classes,and withdrawing all  men with less than 6 months service.                          (ii) Formation of Reserve Divisions.     One first-line white reserve division  is formed in each region on  mobilization, a;strong cadre being detached from each active  division for the purpose.     One second-line white  reserve division  is subsequently formed in  each  region witholder reservists.   Cadres for these divisions will  be obtained from  mobile  units of the Garde Republicaine  and  from  long-service non-commissioned  officers employed  in administrative services.     Further  expansion  in France will depend on the mobilization of war  industries.                           (iii)   Time-Table  of Mobilization.     The 8 higher establishment infantry  divisions  of the covering  force will be readyto move within a few hours of mobilization.   They are, however, not at war strength inpeace, and will take some days to be completed with personnel and animals.     The 12 lower establishments white infantry divisions should be ready to move by the 8th day of mobilization.  Presumably the 5  Expeditionary Force  divisions and, the colonial depot division will be ready within the same period.     The 20 first-line white reserve divisions  should be ready in less than 3  weeks from mobilization.     Within 3 iceeks France should  therefore be able to place 46  infantry  divisions  in the  field.     The 20 second-line white reserve divisions should  be ready between the third and sixth  month after mobilization.     Thus at the end of  the sixth  month of mobilization,  France should have  66  infantry divisions in the field in Europe.     No account has been taken of additional composite divisions which could be obtained from North Africa and the other Colonies.     In favourable circumstances 2 or 3 divisions could probably be obtained from North AFRICA iri the first 3 weeks ; by the end of the first six months a total reinforcement of up to  10  divisions from overseas must be reckoned with.                   (iv)(Strength  and Composition df the Field Army.    - In  the debates in the Chamber,  the Chief of the General Staff stated that 30,000 men were  required in the Field. Army for each  mobilized division and its  proportion of  corps, army  and G-.H.Q. troops.     For an  initial  army of 46 infantry divisions, the Freach will thus have to place about 1,400,000 men  in the field, of whom  only about  one-sixth  will  be  long-service personnel and serving conscripts.  &apos;                                           ,,   .
     To sum up, the reorganization scheme as a whole has  a  sbund frame-work, reduces the period of colour service of the individual, but retains his services in case  of nationaldanger for 28 years.  It appears that, by reversion  to  20 years as the age for conscriptservice in 1935 and for the ensuing four years, the dangerous  period due to war losses in1914-18 may be tided over and the  annual contingent kept  nearly up to establishment.The couverture on the frontier in case  of mobilization should be  ensured by  the  activearmy,  expanded  by the disppnibilite classes.  Colonial  and  overseas defence is arranged for on sound lines.   The  French claim that the organization i3  not  aggressive,  and isbased on the democratic principle of the nation  armee,  besides showing a considerable reduction in peace-time formations and effectives.  An  excellent organization for utilisingall national resources has  been arranged and only awaits legalisation by the passage o the &quot; Law for the organization of the Nation in time of war. -    * This law is not discussed, in this.paper as it.does not affect immediately the technical questionof  army reorganization.   The following G.IsB;  papers dn this subject  have been  Circulated :-C.I.D. 864-B, 827-B, 783-B.     The following points merit consideration, especially  if  one remembers  the  short period of colour service and the very high proportion of reservists in the future mobilizedFrench Army :      (i)  106,000 long-service non-commissioned officers are generally acknowledged as            insufficient for mobilization needs :  LaOjOOO are really required;    (ii&quot;)  By the provisions of the Law of Cadres and. Effectives, the French General Staff            have definitely adopted  an army based on  manpower and  %n the fullest use            of  national reserves, as  opposed to a small professional  army and intensive            mechanization.    This   apparent   disregard  of  Recent  developments  in            mechanization is largely due to the expense involved and the.impossibility of            equippihg a large army  at the Outset with  m&amp;ehines:   The hew organization            iSj  however, in  theory  a distinct  improvement;  being based on sound and            definite principles.   At  the same time it is intentionally framed so as to give            the  necessary elasticity for the increase Or decrease, by decree, of certain types            of units,  as,, for example^ air squadrons-, tank  battalions and specialist units,            arid for the adoption.of  new ideas suited to modern  war;    (iii)  The effectives available are insufficient for the number of units and formations            laid  down ; this necessitates  a certain number  of  units  in  each regiment            beirig maintained in cadre in peace.   This will be a source of weakness to the            first line troops on mobilization.    (iv)  The value  on mobilization of reserve officers and non-commissioned officers, who            will  only  have served 6 months as such in the active army, is problematical.    (v)  In cdBe of  mobilization-, iftsuffifiiSrit stiffening  by white men  of native troOps is            provided  for.    (vi)  The unequal  incidence of colour  service on  whites  and  natives, being in the            proportion of 1  year to  3 years,  may cause  trouble if  it is exploited by            propagandists.    The above points  are realised by the French,  and  have  been  discussed  in theChambers and commented on in the press.
