[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]-Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1928       &apos;SECRET.CP. 193 (28).CABINET.DISARMAMENT.MEMORANDUM BY  THE  LORD  PRIVY SEAL.     THERE appears to be only a slender chance that the Preparatory Commission can be saved from shipwreck.  We must do our best to save it, consistently with the supreme interests of  our Country, but it is likely we shall  fail.  Whether we fail or not, it is important to get a clear conception of the situation in order that we may avoid the pitfalls which surround our path.  The Foreign Secretary  or the Chancellor of the Duchy are much better qualified than I am to give a full account up to  date of the developments  of the disarmament question at Geneva, but it may be of use if,  as Chairman  of the Disarmament Committee, I suggest for considera- tion  what   should   be  the  governing  factors  in  our  policy,  all  the  more because, unfortunately, these factors are not very easy to reconcile with each  other. They are :      1.  To keep  in line with the French, without which we may be isolated on this           question in Europe.    ,2.  To avoid friction with America, which is fundamental to our general policy.     3.  To prevent the Germans denouncing the  disarmaments provisions of  the           Treaty of Versailles, upon which the settlement after the Great War           depends.     There has been,  as my colleagues will remember,  considerable danger that, on the Naval side of the question, France would come to terms with the United States and leave us  in the cold.  We were anxious that the Foreign Secretary should use his personal influence to  prevent this, and at first sight it  was gratifying that he was able to report to us an offer  of co-operation  from the French Government.  This offer,  however,  predicates that cruiser &quot;strength should  be determined  by  the geographical  length   of  naval  communications.   Unfortunately,  this  policy  unmodified at any rate would give the British Empire such an advantage as against America that the mere announcement  of it might produce an  explosion in that Country sufficient to  upset the  structure of international peace aspirations  upon which we are relying at this moment to produce a better  feeling between us.  So that a crude attempt  to conform to  the line of  the  French offer that is, to  fulfil the first governing factor  in our policy, as I have stated it is calculated to produce the friction with America the avoidance of which constitutes the second and even more important factor in our international position.  It is  evident,  therefore,  that  we cannot go as  far as the French would lead us.  But the reasons for coming to terms with them if possible  remain cogent, not merely, as I have said, to prevent us  from being isolated, but because, in the absence of a really substantial advance towards a disarmament solution, the Germans will undoubtedly kick over the traces and thus the third governing factor in  our policy, viz., the unquestioned maintenance of the relevant Articles in the Treaty  of Versailles will come to grief.   We must, there- fore, try to  find some middle course sufficiently near the French to  keep them in line, but not going so far as to outrage American opinion, while,  at the  sametime, with the hope that a substantial move forward in the negotiations may  avertand perhaps  ultimately avoid  the crisis with Germany.   The question then for the Cabinet as I  see it is, how far, in view of these  other preoccupations, can we  go tomeet the French  offer ?[17821]
     We can certainly say that the length of comnmnieations is an  indispensableconsideration in determining cruiser strength.  We can even lay it down that, in ourview, every Power, in deciding its standard of cruiser strength.,&quot; ought to be guided by the length of its communications, but we cannot say that length of communicationsis conclusive,, for in that case there is the gravest risk that friction with america would be inevitable.  On the contrary, we must say again, as we said at the CoolidgeConference, that our own minimum  cruiser strength must, indeed, depend upon thelength of our communications, but that though we think other Powers ought to be guided by a like consideration, yet we do not pretend to dictate to them.   Of course,I  am fully aware  that  an indispensable  consideration  is not the same thing asa  conclusive condition.   No doubt,  the  French will  not  be satisfied with  an indispensable consideration, but itis possible, nevertheless, that they will swallow it,since it must become evident to them that they will never persuade the American or italian  member of the Preparatory  Commission to accept the rigidity of their own policy.  However that may be, we can go no further.  We must always leave it open for us  to  be able  to  say to the American  Government that, though  length of communications is our solution, yet we entirely recognise their liberty of  action.     In  passing, however^ it should, be noted that with the discussion directed onthese lines common  action  between  France  and  the  United  States  on naval disarmament becomes much more remote.     Lastly, there is some chance that if  the  French will work  with us on thesemodified lines,  the German representatives, who I believe do not themselves desireto breakup the Preparatory Commission, may find in this some material with which to persuade their own public opinion that the negotiations are not dead.  In that case we may hope to carry on over the American Presidential Election, with theultimate possibility of a modus vivendi in Naval Armaments between the americans and-ourselves.  I need not say that I have not forgotten that both American  andGerman opinion  may  be  expected to be more malleable in the atmosphere. of theAmerican  peace movement, so that, even  with such unsatisfactory materials, thenegotiations may be sufficient to carry us over.     Whatever the line Lord Cushendun takes at  Geneva whether it be such as Ihave suggested, or a ^better line I need not say it  must be entirely for  him to decide how far these demarches should be carried on  privately, rather  than publicly,&quot;between the representatives of the several Powers, and when, if at all,  it may bepossible to bring them into the open.June 18, 1928.
