C 0 NFIDE NT IA L.               FRENCH TARIFF NSGGTIAT 10 NS .   THE PRESIDENT recalled that two Council meetings ago thequestion of tariff negotiations with the French had beendiscussed, and he had then explained the line H.M.Governmentwere proposing to take, with which the Council entirelyconcurred.  A communication had been sent to the French, andhe thought that the reply which had been received from them was satisfactory in that they rather tentatively asked againwhether we could not give them an undertaking that no dutyof our&apos;s would ever be raised against them if they were pre-pared to stabilise their duties on the more important articlesat their present rate,,  The answer to that  from our sideseemed to be tl^at, they having made a new tariff, and we havingthe benefit of most favoured nation treatment in all thearrangements they have made, there was not  much likelihood oftheir putting up their duties further at present.  They hadrefrained from putting up their coal duties in response to our representations, and therefore we were proposing to followon exactly the same line we had taken hitherto, and we had concluded our last proposal by saying to them that we rely,of course, upon the maintenance of most favoured nation treat-&apos;ment, and they,  on their side, would,no doubt, not fail totake note of the generous way in wrJLch their products had been treated in this country for many years past.COAL.     MR  WARHAM wrote: -     &quot;The weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for thethree weeks ended April 14th was as under:                 March 51st ....... 5,270.,000 tons                 April  7th....... 4,346,000  v                 April 14th....... 3,241,000  &quot;The output for the week ended March 31st was 100.6;^ of the March1925 weekly average  basis.     The number of persons employed In the industry for the weekended March 31st was 84.3%, calculated on the same basis.     Unemployment for the month of March was 17.2$, as against18.5/i in February and 9.3/s In March 1926*     The quantity of coal exported In March was 4,110,663 tons,as compared with 4,007,631 tons in February.  The value per ton.o.b. showed a slight increase, being 15/10 as compared with15/9 per ton in February.&quot;
COAL (COFTD.)      LORD GAINFORD  thought  that hot torn price had been reached in the coal  Industry.    The price  f.o.b.  on the  North East coast for unscreened coal today ranged from 13/6d  to 14/-, and no seller was going to  take a  less price than  that.   The export price for,coke  was 17/- to  17/6d.   . The competition with countries abroad was not quite so keen as it  had been, although the Silesian Government was  still subsidising their coal to an extent of 5/- a  ton in  the  reduction  of railway rates, which constituted, a  very serious obstacle to our  export coal trade.    The tendency  in Germany  was  for the  cost of pro- duct ion to rise,  and the Germans were  not  finding  their collieries very profitable  just nor?.      The recently formed organisations in  the coalfield  which were trying  to prevent undue  competition In the  home market would steady the  price of coal, and prices were  not likely to go down any further.  The scheme in the five counties had already  come  Into  operation, stocks were hieing steadily reduced, and. it was hoped to  maintain  at any rate  the quantity now being  produced end to advance to an Increased quantity when the present stocks were  reduced.      Lord Galnford  also mentioned  that he  had just come  back from &amp; visit to Rome,  where he had met a number  of Indus- industrialists.   He had had an  opportunity during his  year of office as President of the  Federation  of British Industries to make similar visits to Paris and Berlin, and  next week Industrialists in Sweden were coming over  here to  a confer- ence.   He thought  that these meetings were all  to the good and a very friendly feeling had been created by  them.    The visit to Italy had  been especially useful.   Not only  were the Italians found  to  be very much more pro-British than formerly, but there was a general  agreement arrived at very rapidly in all matters that came under discussion  at the Conference.    As  indicating the improved attitude  towards this country,  he  mentioned  the choice  of the Italian children -  which he thought  often reflected the views of  their  parents -  in the matter of  an  optional foreign language  to be  learnt at school.  .  l^ereas before the War most children  preferred German to English,  now English was chosen by the majority.      Among the subjects discussed at Rome was the  question of the export  of  coal  from  this country to Italy.    Last year the Italians took only 45 per cent, of their  total  con- sumption from Great Britain,  though before the war  they were taking 87 per  cent.    Their consumption of coal, in  spite of all they had  done in connection with electrical power, had Increased, and British coal interests were very  anxious that the German reparation  coal  should not  exclude British coal. The freights,  being low, were in our  favour.    The Italians indicated that  they preferred British to German coal and there  was not much  fear  of  their  taking Silesian coal.   TheBritish delegates came away tinder the  Impression that there would  be  no restrictions placed by the Government upon the consumers of coal In Italy taking Increased quantities from Great  Britain,  and he thought their visit  had done  something to  help  that situation.
COAL (CONTD.)     THE PRESIDENT was glad to hear Lord  Gainford&apos;s statement as to the attitude of the Italian coal consumers-  H.M.Govern-ment had made strong representations to the Italian Governmentthat they should enforce a Reparations Recovery Act, insteadof taking an increased amount of German coal, but the  italian minister of Finance was strongly opposed  to it.  At that  time,he did not think we were getting very much support from theItalian manufacturer or importer, so he was gratified  to  hearLord Gainford&apos;s impression of their changed attitude.     MR. MITCHELL said that in Scotland there was no improve-ment In the coal trade.  As to the selling scheme in Scotlandit was too early yet to say how this would work.  There hadbeen a considerable amount of unemployment in consequence ofit, but those who were employed were better employed; that isto say, the collieries still remaining at work were workingfuller time.   No recent returns were available, but there hadnot been a very great reduction in the actual output although a considerable reduction in the capacity for output.  Un-fortunately output had been maintained at a very serioussacrifice in the export trade.IRON AND STEEL.     MR. BOND v;rote:-     &quot;The improvement in  production which  took  place inFebruary was maintained in March, for  the  production of  pigiron rose from 550,800 tens in February to 592,600 tons  inMarch, and there was a net increase of two in the number offurnaces blowing at the end of March.  Steel production  rose from 7 6 4, 40C tons in February to 793,300 tons in March.     &quot;The Increase in Continental prices which  took place inFebruary did not have much effect on imports of iron and  steel in March, for these amounted to 271,500 tons and were only15,000 tons less than in  February.  Exports, however, rose to 409,300 tons and were  the highest since May,  the increasebeing mainly due to increased exports of pig iron, steel  bars,rods, angles etc., plates and sheets, galvanised sheets,tinplates and sheets and  railway rails.  In the case of  pigiron, production is being maintained at approximately the march level and consumption is about equal to production  sothat stocks are no longer accumulating-  On the other hand,there is no disposition at present to blow in Crash furnaces,for although a slight improvement in hematite pig iron has caused the North Lonsdale Ironworks to re -start  two hematitefurnaces at Ulverston,  the Mi Horn and Askam Company are damp-ixig one furnace at Mi Horn.  Very little foreign pig iron isnow being imported,  and the imports which at this time lastyear reached the rate of 60,000 to 70,000 tons a month as
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD. ).an aftermath of the strike, have fallen to an average of15,000 tons a month in the first quarter this year; and, whilethe export trade has not revived to the extent that could be desired,  exports of pig iron in March amounted to 41,500 tonsor nearly twice as much as in March 1927.  The price ofCleveland pig iron which rose by l/- per ton in the middle ofMarch has been maintained.     &quot;The strike in the Swedish ore mines continues, whichrenders iron ore a very firm market.      &quot;With  regard  to  steel there were  indications  towards  the end  of March  that  output  was not being maintained  at  the level reached in the  beginning  of  the  month,  and even allowing for  the  Easter holidays April output will not reach that of March,   Continental material is being  offered at much under British  prices, and one big firm of shipbuilders on the Tees is reported to be  using exclusively foreign steel  plates. While a  fair  output of British  steel is  at present going into the  shipyards, fears  are  expressed because shipbuilders1 order books are not being filled as arrears  are worked off.  The structural departments of some  steel works are busy,  and Messrs.  Dorrnan Long and Company have recently secured a bridge contract for  Southern Rhodesia,  but the  output of structural steel absorbs  but  a very  small part of steel  works output, and  the  structural steel  trade as represented by those who purchase steel and fabricate are stated  to be under-employed generally.      &quot;The position is still dominated  by Continental competition in this market.  It is, therefore, interesting to note  that the  iron and steel industrialists in Germany have addressed a protest to the Labour Minister and the Minister for Rconomic  Affairs  stating that the  result  of the award in the Ruhr coal  mining  industry will be  to add  l/6d per  ton to the cost of steel  rails and sections,   2/- per ton to  bar iron, and 3/-  per  ton to plates; but,   as has  often been noted, the worst competition which this  country has to face comes not from Germany but from Prance and Belgium.   That this  severe competition between France and Belgium and the British market is not in the best interests of those countries themselves is  evident from a statement by a Erench iron and steel manufacturer a few days ago to the effect that  such competition has resulted in a considerable loss to  both countries since prices have been cut to  a point where little or no profit has been possible.   He urges an agreement with the help of the banks and possibly of   the Governments between the two countries whereby this  wasteful competition may be eliminated-      &quot;As regards conditions in  South Wales,  market  conditions for the galvanised sheet industry are  not satisfactory.  As regards the tinplate industry,  the improvement previously recorded is well maintained.   The industry has been working 75 per cent of capacity for the  past four months.   There  is a reasonable prospect of the demand being sufficient  during thenext few months to absorb an  increased output.  There  is  an
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.).increasing confidence in the market generally, resulting inbetter prices and in business being placed in considerable quantities for fairly extended delivery.     &quot;The iron and steel industry has welcomed the announce-ment by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the concessions on local rates and railway rates to producing industries.  As faras can be calculated from the data available, it appears thatthe value of the concession is equal to about 3/6 to 4/- perton of finished steel, but the great drawback is the fact thatthe concessions do not apply for a further eight-sen monthsduring which the position of the industry must be stillfurther weakened.  While the industry welcomes the annource-ment as a step in the right direction, there is no doubt that much more far-reaching measures must be taken if the industryis to develop or even retain its present employment capacity.&quot;     ICR.  HIGH  said  that  the maintenance  of  the  relatively high rate  of iron and  steel production appeared to  justifythe impression that the  volume of  trade  was on  the  up grade,and that  this  was likely to continue  for a  time at  least.   Ithad to  be  remembered,  however, that the  tendency was, for an upward  movement in  production at the  early  part of  the newyear and which reached its maximum in March.  If one soughtan indication  of the trend of trade from the  returns ofimports and exports, it -would be found that the figures  tended to-show that the ground  lost in 1926, was being recovered.     As to employment, despite the increased  production  therehad been an increase in  the volume of unemployment, thisindicating that the tendency of output to increase  per unit of labour  employed  which had been  going  on  during &quot;the past few years, was still in  progress.  In the tinplate  trade therehad been a material reduction in the  percentage of  unemployment,probably due to the method of working the output restrictions,which provided for  a closing down  for three weeks in thirteen,and the manner in which  the work was  being  distributed toavoid total unemployment.     Mr. Pugh&apos;s attention had been directed to  the  difficulty which had  been experienced, particularly in the South KalesSteel trade, with regard  to the scrap supplies,   and as it was contemplated to raise  this with the  resident of the Board ofTrade,   he  //ould take the  opportunity  of mentioning  it.   Itwould be understood that  at the present time, the availability of ample supplies of scrap was an  important factor  in high as well as economio production,  and apparently  scrap from government Yards and from ship-breakin&amp; yards dealing with government ships as well as railway scrap, was  finding its way to  the Continent in increasing quantities, while at thesame time Continental&apos;Countries  prohibited  the  export of scrap except on licence.   While,  therefore,  the  Government
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD.). prevented trie export of ships for breaking up on the Continent in order that British  labour might be employed in that process, it appeared that works in South Wales were likely to come to a standstill because of the inability of steel producers in this country to obtain scrap as readily as no ght be the case but for the fact of this being disposed of to Continental competitors.  It was probably a question of price, but the South Wales producers were handicapped because of the distance from the source of supply and the consequent cost of transit.     THE PRESIDENT remarked that the matter had been examined by the Board of Trade  and the Admiralty.   There was a condition on the sale  of any Government ships for breaking- up that the breaking-up was to be done in this country.  The amount of Admiralty scrap was not very large,  and therefore the amount over which  we could exercise any control was comparatively small and there were reasons why it was difficult,  if not, impossible, to make it a condition of sale that the scrap was only to be used in this country.   Backed by the whole business  community,  a Convention had been negotiated with the object of getting rid of import and export prohibitions everywhere.  We had succeeded in getting such prohibitions abolished in our commercial treaty with Germany, - subject to a list of exceptions,  and,  under the most-favoured-nation provisions in other treaties,  other countries had the advantage of those provisions of the German treaty.   There- fore both under our treaties and under the policy we had been pursuing at Geneva,  it would, be  difficult,  if not impossible, for us now to say that steel scrap was not to be exported from this country.   If it was desired to secure a steady flow from the breaking-up yards into  the steel works,  it  wouldhave to be,  he thought, a.matter of negotiation between the steel trade and the shipbreakers.   With regard to thecontinental system of licensing,  he was informed that under the French system we were entitled in this country to take upa quota of French scrap, and that as a matter of fact wehave never taken up our full quota.     LORD GAINFORD reported that in iron and steel theposition remained unchanged.  The foundry trade was not takingthe volume of business that it had been taking a few months ago.  The hematite section had been very quiet.  In the steel products department the margin bet-ween British and foreignprices showed no further widening, and British makers had beenobtaining a share of the business that had been going.   Twofurnaces had been put into blast at Ulverston by the lonsdaleCompany, and one furnace put out at Millom.   Imports of ironand steel during March were 27 4,000 tons,  exports were445,000 tons.  The finished steel imported and  exported  was practically the same, but in the semi-finished products107,000 tons were imported and practically none exported.  Thecontinental position seemed to be unchanged and was apparentlyjust being carried on on a profitable basis.
                                3 iron AND STEEL (CONTD.)     MR. MITCHELL reported that In Scotland the steel trade was not well employed.  There had been a consider-able falling off recently, and the prospects were notvery favourable, on account of the falling off in ship-building.  There was still a considerable importation,at least to judge from the February returns, of steelplates into Scotland from the Continent.  As regards pigiron the competition from the Continent was not so severeas it had been, but works were finding difficulty in getting their production sold and the prices were veryunprofitable.                         STEEL.     SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR was sorry to have  to say  that  inSheffield the special steel trade and  the  tool, trade had fallen  off very much In April.  The alloy  consumptionfor the first three months of the year, that is tungsten,chromium, vanadium, etc., had been  the highest they had had for any three months since the war, but April  had fallenoff tremendously.  In fact the average for the four months was  going to be below that for  the  same four months of last year.  The fall had  come very suddenly,and they found it was particularly  the big ship buildersand the engineers who were not ordering anything  like  the quantities  of special steels and tools they had orderedIn the first three months.     As regards the British Empire, Canada was very good.We seemed to be beating the Americans  there.  New zealand and South Africa were good.  Australia had fallen off verymuch.  The Australian Government had   definitely  put onthe 70/- duty on a number of classes of steel  going in,and that perhaps had something to do with  it.  India wasfair, but there was a tendency to buy  locally  in  India,which would force British firms to  go  there arid have theirown stocks, otherwise consumers would  buy  from the Bazaartrade and get a low quality palmed  off on  them, which would destroy our reputation.  Japan was  slightly but steadilyimproving.  In China goods were now beginning to  get stuckat the ports, and not going up-country.     In Europe, Germany was a very bad market, while Franceand Italy were dead.  In Spain great difficulties were still being encountered with the Customs, in spite of the speech ofthe Spanish Ambassador.  The Spanish had another  tariffready which would be higher than the present tariff.  the publicity which had already taken place in this country had,however, caused them some embarrassment and the ambassador had been writing to one or- two people asking if it could notbe softened down somewhat.  South America was a bright spotin the trade, and we were holding our own  there againstthe Germans and everyone.
NON-FERROUS METALS.-     SIR CECIL BUDD was sorry to say that he had not a very good report to give this month.  Business in metals had beenvery slow.  Demand was fitful and patchy.  Tin plates and cable making, he thought, were the only Industries which mightbe said to be really active up to anything like capacity atthe present time.   Brass and copper had gone back.  Galvanisinghad been fairly good, but it was going back a little now.  the lead trade was rather slow and suffering somewhat fromContinental competition again.  He thought it was possible thatthe dull condition of the raw material markets might have something to do with all this, orders being held back for lower prices.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES-.     SIR PHILIP NASH wrote:-          &quot;There has been little change In the electricalindustry since I spoke last month.  If anything, the demandfor electrical machinery generally has been a little lessactive, especially in the cable section, but I do not thinkthat there is any marked weakening in the market.&quot;ENGINEERING.     SIR ERNEST FETTER wrote :-          f&apos;A survey of the relevant statistics for March, andof the first quarter&apos;a results, justifies a feeling of mildconfidence concerning the industrial outlook.  As predicted in last month&apos;s notes, the production of iron and steel hasexpanded still further, and although there may have been, inthe case of iron and steel and in the engineering trades, some-thing of a pause in the rate of new business coming forward, thiswas perhaps due to the usual pre-Budget hesitancy makingItself felt.  Statistics of export trade in engineering and metal products for the past, quarter, as will be seen later,show better results than In the three previous years.  Thestate of employment also is generally improved, and we are bene-fitting at the present time from a favourable condition andprospect of industrial peace.   The Budget, which has just been introduced in the Rouse of Commons, contains one feature whichis very welcome to engineering and the other heavy industries.The scheme of rating relief for productive industry, by whichit is intended to remove three-fourths of the present load oflocal taxation, should at least secure a pronounced alleviationof one of the burdens which have for so long depressed ourbasic industries.  The advantages will not only be direct throughthe relief In actual rates paid, but also indirect through theprescribed reduction in railway and other freight rates.
ENGINEERING (CONTD.)          &quot;The quantity of machinery exported In Marchamounted to 51,085 tons, making a total for the first quarterof 144,878 tons, higher than the corresponding figure for anypost-war year, and equal to an annual rate of export of almost580,000 tons.  The greatest advance, comparing thecorresponding quarters of this and the last three years, hasbeen made in the case of textile machinery, boilers andboiler house plant, lifting machinery, and electricalmachinery, while considerable improvement is also shewn inthe general class.  The sections which are relativelydepressed are machine tools, prime movers, and agricultural machinery most of all.  The export value per ton has remainedfairly stable over the past four years round about  95.Imports of machinery are increasing year by year.  In the quarter just ended we have imported almost 25,000 tons, asagainst 22,500 tons in the first quarter of last year, andnot quite 18,000 tons in 1925.  The largest increases in theimports have occurred In textile machinery, machine tools,electrical machinery, and the miscellaneous class.          &quot;The level of unemployment over all trades and industries fell appreciably during March, the percentagefigure amongst insured workpeople at the end of the monthbeing 9.6/* compared with 10.4;f in February.  The index forengineering as a whole fell also from 9.4,? to 9.3,1, there being an improvement in each branch with the exception ofconstructional engineering which remained stationary at10.0/c-,  V;hile the shipbuilding unemployment index went up from 21^0% to 22.3.&quot;, that for marine engineering fell from11,8,  to 11.6;&apos;, but the latest quarterly statistics shipbuilding issued by Lloyds Register, indicate quite clearly a falling off in the volume of construction work onhand, and this is bound ultimately to affect employmentin the marine engineering trades          &quot;According to statistics which have recentlyappeared in the Board of Trade Journal, the number of skilledmetal and engineering workers emigrating from Britain In1927 was 7,806, compared with 8,676 in 1926, and 7,515 in1925.   Of these there went to the various parts of theBritish Dominions in the respective years 5,447, 6,326, and5,160.   The net lose of these skilled workers in each year,making allowance for corresponding immigrants,  was 5,074,6,217 and 4,496.    The peak year of such emigration occurred in 1923, when no less than 24,724 skilled metal and engineer-ing workers left this country.  The most significant fact,however, is that the majority of these emigrant skilled workers continue to be between the  ages of 18 and 30,  andtherefore represent a maximum loss  of potential labourefficiency to the home industry which they have lefts&quot;
ENGINEER!NG (OONTDs).     m* RICHMOND wrote:-       &quot;The position in Marine Engineering throughout thecountry ia becoming more acute, as great difficulty is being experienced in securing new contracts to replace the work inhand as it is completed.  The prospects of decreased costs,due to the Chancellor&apos;s proposals, are somewhat remote, as theeffect of these will not materialise for eighteen months, andmeantime the shipbuilding employers have offered a specialbonus advance of 3/- per week to plain time workers withsome exceptions as a result of the men&apos;s application, and itis now being voted upon.  The engineering employers have been unable to offer any advance to the. engineers, and Sir AllanSmith&apos;s published statement at the Conference with theUnions gives adequate grounds for the regrettable position inwhich the engineering industry finds itself to-day.      &quot;on the North East Coast, there is a fair amount of activity, but it is in the launching and completion of vessels and engines, ten vessels of 42,881 tons having been launched in the month.  On the Clyde much the same holds good, and onthe river there were launched during April nineteen vesselsaggregating 28,434 tons gross  as compared with twenty-onevessels of 33,7^8 tons  in the  same month last year.  only three contracts of any  importance have been placed during themonth.  An interesting recent  event is the launching of the&quot;City of Lille&quot; for the Ellerman Line by Messrs. Barclay,Ourle and Company.  This vessel is equipped with  Doxfordopposed piston Diesel engines  of 4,500 H*.P.  Two sister ships for the same company are already in commission havingreciprocating steam engines and geared steam turbines,respectively.  With these similar vessels under one ownership,reliable comparative data as  to their performance and running costs should become available, and should be of great value in determining the commercial  merits of the different powersystems.      &quot;The statistics obtainable from Lloyds Register for thefirst quarter of the year, if  interesting, are somewhatdisquieting, and do not afford any evidence of improvement inthe shipbuilding and engineering position.  They indicate, infact, that there has been a decrease of nearly a hundred thousand tons of work under construction during the last six months.  The launches have also been on the descendingscale during the same period,      &quot;in marine engines under  construction over tho last quarter, Great Britain  and Ireland, compared with the rest ofthe v?orld, show a  gratifying  total of 918,659 H.P. the nearest  to this being Germany with 294,320 H,P. whioh,however, docs not  include turbines, the figures for which arenot  available.  Italy follows  with 191,000 H,?., Denmarkwith  156,220, and  Holland with 135,830.      &quot;Employment should continue  at  its present level till the  July hoiiaays,  but  thereafter  a decrease is probableunless  new work  is  secured.   In  general engineering  inScotland,  business  is  better,  and  the  locomotive works havea number of  good   orders  in hand.&quot;
MOTOR CAR INDUSTRY.     SIR JOHN THORNYCROFT thought that commercial and passenger vehicle manufacturers appreciated the rebateof 20 per cent, on the duties as regards vehiclesexceeding two tons unladen weight or seating more thaneight persons if fitted solely with pneumatic tyres.The position, however, was not quite so satisfactory asto the new scale of duties on goods vehicles.  Consider-ing that the private car duties advanced by steps of  1per horse power, there seemed no logical reason why the advances on goods vehicles should not be in smaller steps,as suggested by the Commercial vehicle manufacturers.There was still a jump from two tons to three tons unladen weight, with an increase of duty from  25 to  40, viz. anincrease of  15.  The position as regards the two tonclass in particular was rather exceptional.  The WarOffice subsidy vehicle, constructed to carry a usefulload of 30 cwts., had been sold to a considerable extent in this country, not only carrying the subsidy but also tousers without the subsidy, as the number subsidised bythe War Office was very limited.  The weight of the&quot;subsidy 30 cwt. vehicle was just over two tons, whereasit was possible to build a 30 cwt. vehicle which competedwith it, very slightly under the two tons.  The WarOffice were anxious that the subsidy vehicle should bebrought into general use in this country by users who could not get the subsidy, and there were large numbersof users who would be prepared to pay more for the WarOffice subsidy vehicle than for the non-subsidy typevehicles if they were not penalised under the taxationby reason of the cwt. or so extra unladen weight due tothe subsidy specification.     With regard to the general state of the industry,certain manufacturers with modern production plants ?/erenot able to keep them working up to anything like thefull capacity on which their prices had been fixed.  Themost successful development in export business had beenin the 7 tup. Austin which seemed to be taking the placeof the motor bicycle in a number of places abroad.COTTON.     SIR KENNETH STEWART reported that April had proved to be a very dull month,&quot;  from every market one receivedthe same report, that fresh orders had come forward in very small volume.  Africa had been the brightest spot,North Africa, West Africa, and Egypt, having been wellup to normal, that is normal for these times.  Asia hadbeen very quiet Indeed, Calcutta very dull, Bombay andKarachi shotting some interest but not booking much freshbusiness, and China, so far as staples were concerned,displaying.a complete absence of interest.  Home, Empire,and South American markets were quiet, though not quiteinactive.
COTTON. (CONTD.)     Of course, even in such a quiet month as this therehad been a steady current of business, especially infancies, and the quietness of the market did not meancomplete stagnation.  The first quarter of the year had seen an exceptional volume, for these times, of businessbooked for almost all markets, covering several months.The business booked was keeping spindles and looms fairlybusy now, and the consumption of yarn appeared from reports to be well up to normal.  Prices had risen and a processof digesting the business put in hand during the first three months of this year was now going on.  Such a pausewas not unusual, and there seemed to be no very unhealthysymptons in the foreign markets such as would make a revival of trade unlikely when once the market was con-vinced that the present higher prices of goods caused bythe rise  of cotton had come to stay, and &quot;when the variousforeign merchants had been able to spread the responsibilityof their purchases up-country from the various entrepots.     It appeared . that in the last month or so the yarntrade had improved its position by about 2%, but that wasa very small amount compared to the difference beingcaused by the much higher cotton prices, rax? cotton priceshaving risen something like l%d. a lb. in the last 6 or7 months.  Those who had got their business booked,&apos; andbooked in very considerable volume, were ivaiting until they saw how profits were likely to turn out before theybooked again,  A certain amount of averaging was alwaysdone, but not so much on this occasion because of thelarge bookings that had been put through in February and march.     Trouble in Egypt and the usual state of war In china were about the only unhealthy factors.  In the latterplace spot prices were not too bad for British goods,especially plain staples, perhaps because the Chinesecould only satisfactorily hate one foreign nation at atime, and for the moment their ha.te  was concentrated onthe Japanese, whoso action in sending troops to Tsingtauand the Tsingtau-Tsinanfu Railway and so interfering with the national sport of civil war, had. made themtemporarily unpopular.     As to demand generally, it was very difficult  to foresee exactly when a revival would take place.  A gooddeal depended on the course of the raw material.  There wasplenty of time for the new American cotton to turn out well,which-would result in a big drop in prices, and. mostmerchants all over the world were only buying from hand tomouth in fear lest they might be faced with a heavy stockand falling prices.  The very great fluctuation In prices,and - on the average - the heavy losses entailed on nativemerchants who dealt in cotton goods in Eastern markets inthe last ten years, was one distinct cause for the depressedstate of the cotton industry.  Natives and foreigners had found they could get better returns in almost any line oftrade than they could in cotton goods.

LEE wrote:-             &quot;The fine trade - that part of the trade using      Egyptian or equivalent cotton - which during the past      year has been keeping full running and generally able to      hold its own in the matter of costs, has had during the     , past month a very serious relapse, and at the present time      finds very few orders coming forward, and those of an      unsatisfactory character in the way of margin on the raw      material.  This has not resulted up to date in any serious      decrease of production, but undoubtedly in the case of      spinners a considerable quantity of stock must be      accumulated, and unless the demand improves  very shortly      it appears to me that there will be a certain amount of      short time in the case of at. any rate the weaker spinners,      and there must be a curtailment in the weaving section.  I      am inclined to put this collapse of the trade down to the      big jump in the cost of cotton.             &quot;Taking Fully Good Fair Sakel as a guide, the      price in February was as low as 16,60d. , and the quotation      to-day stands at 21d,, while the figure at which the better      qualities can be to-day bought is round about 26d. which      is even a greater advance than that shown by the standard      Fully G-ood Fair quality.  This price is not in any way      justified by the position of supply and demand, and      merchants, shippers and retailers have, as you know, in      former years been so seriously hit by falls in value that      they are frightened to-day to operate, and are only      purchasing what they have to have, to keep their customers      going from hand to mouth.  Should the cotton planter and      merchant be able to keep the price up to Its present level      then I think that we are in for a period of very      restricted trade in these qualities, but if, as may happen,      they find it impossible to sell reasonable weights at      these figures, and the price of cotton -comes down to a      reasonable figure, then I see no obstacle to the resumption      of an ordinary business.             &quot;in the heavy section the position remains very      much as it was when I had the pleasure of making my last      report, but I think that, although very little progress has      been made, still we may consider that some little advance      has taken place.  It seems to me that the employers and the      workpeople are getting a little bit nearer together and the      suggestion of combinations on the  coarse side is a good omen      for the future, if they can be carried out.  Apart from      this there appears to me to be very little change in the      situation.             &quot;I should like to record great satisfaction at the      proposed relief to rates which the Chancellor of the      Exchequer has put forward.  This will in itself be of      very great help to the trade, and  it may be of  greater      help than  just the relief  given by these operations,      because  it appears to me that it may start a movement all      round in every direction in cheapening the costs of      production in the trade.&quot;
WOOL.     MR. ARTHUR SHAW thought the positinn in general could be stated to be much the same as had. existed for the past tv*omonths.   There was one remarkable feature about the worstedsection of the industry.  From the last official figuresrecorded, the number actually employed in the weaving sectionhad reached the highest point for the past three years.   Thefigures returned by the employers showed that, taking thestandard as 100 at the beginning of 1926, the figure nowactually employed was 103.6.   Earnings had similarlyincreased, and the wages for the month ending March had reached the highest point for the past three years, namely109.7 as against the figure of 100 In January 1926.  It wouldappear, therefore, that the figures of diminishing unemploymentpreviously given at the Council were a true reflex and ageneral index of the trade, and these had been maintained during the past month.   It wag true that in the worsted trade,while the unemployed as recorded in the vacant books were4.27 during the whole of March, during April the figures,which had just been returned, were found to be 4.5, - which showed a slightly higher level in the worsted branch of thetrade.  In the woollen trade, however, while the figures for march  had been 15.22, they had steadily  decreased and for april were 13.34.     In the dyeing and finishing end of the industryunfortunately there had been no settlement in the troublebetween the employers and the trade tuiions, and this had now reached a very aciite stage.   Indeed on the following day theemployers would receive a commu.nlcat!on vtiich Indicated the seriousness of the position.   This might materially affectthe cotton trade as well as the woollen and worsted trade, andembrace 80,000 operatives;  and \mless something was done inthe immediate future no hopes could be held out but that therewould be a stoppage in the dyeing and finishing industry.  Itarose out of the cancellation of the Mackenzie award last november.  There was then a long discussion with regard towages of time workers.  The unions had now made a definitedemand to the employers for all the employees to be put oncollective piece work.  It was one of the industries wherethe trade union officers were satisfied that collective piecework was the best method both for the employers and theworkers.  The unions felt quite definitely that there would, be.better production, cheaper production, and higher wages forthe operatives.  It was a curious thing that they would begoing on strike to have collective piece work.  The Mackenzieaward was given with the agreement of the parties, and therewas an agreement to refer back matters in dispute.  But once that  Agreement was finally terminated there was no arrangementwhatever for dealing with a dispute.     THE PRESIDENT said that it had been suggested to him thatthe improvement, In the Bradford area at any rate, was largely due to the development of artificial silk, and did not reallyreflect the actual  employment of woollen or worsted workerso
WOOL (CONTD.)     FIR.  SHAY?, however, stated that he was satisfied thatit was not at all the artificial silk trade that had had theeffect of Improving the position;  it was the worsted tradeitself,     MR. AYjKROYD observed that the textile trade in the ViestRiding had experienced a quiet period as far as new orders were concerned since the last meeting of the Council.   Thedemand for wool and its products had not revived much sinceEaster and there was an element of uncertainty, which hadcrept into the market and was interfering with the flow ofbusiness in all sections of the industry.  Tops and yams hadweakened without any business of importance having been done,and prices for the time being were of a nominal character.Small orders had been taken at less than the highest point ofthe advance in prices, and there would not be an exact indica-tion of the true position of values until there was asubstantial buying movement.   The London sales would begin-next week and should set at rest the uneasiness which nowruled in the minds of many, for the supplies were not large and it was confidently expected that prices would remain firm.Apparently there were no very big stocks in any country, thatis, unsold stocks were only sufficient to meet requirements,assuming machine consumption in all the principal centresremained steady,.  Confidence in the raw material positiontherefore appeared to be as strong as ever, though users wouldprobably continue to act with caution until London had once more indicated the strength of the world demand.  Machinery inmost sections was running quite as well as a month ago,although orders were getting dealt with pretty quickly and afewer number remained on the books.  At this time of the year the financial pressure was greatest and it was more than like-ly that during this month and next - May and June - therewould be no change to report, owing to the pressure of financing the raw material purchased in the overseas market,which would be corning to hand very freely during these months.In the spinning industry business was decidedly quieter,though mills were still running fairly well.     In the combing branch of the industry there was rather more machinery running than in the previous month.  the statistics showed 82-g- per cent.of the full capacity of combsrunning as against 73 per cent, a month ago, but there wagtalk of a slight falling off in work and. the tendency was atany rate not upward, but possibly downward.  The manufacturingsection was quieter.,  The position in the dress trade was un-changed and remained very bad, - About 56 per cent.of thelooms were running full time and the order books indicated adecline in the number of orders.  In the menls wear trade the advance in prices had choked off orders a little.  It was extremely difficult to get the advance on the manufacturedgoods;  for examplej twenty ounce cloth had advanced, on anaverage, lOd a yard since nine months ago.  There was a lackof confidence in the higher prices, and piece merchantsanticipated a reduction, however slight.  There was someuneasiness at the increase in the Australian tariff.  Woollenpiece goods weighing over 6-J- ozs. per square yard and costingless than 3s,4d. per square yard were formerly liable to duty
COUFIIENTIAL.-WOOL (CONTD.)at la. per square yard and 30 per cent, ad valorem.  Otherpiece goods paid a duty of 35 per cent, ad valorem.  Under thenew rate, which became operative on March 28th, all wool piecegoods weighing more than 6 ozs, per square yard, irrespective of price, paid a duty of Is. per square yard and 30 per cent,ad valorem.  This was hitting Huddersfield very severely.Previously they had done quite a good business In their highclass goods, which were all above 3s.4d. a square yard, but now they were to be on the same level as the common goods.     Conditions in the Yeadon and Guiseley districts had become decidedly worse and not more than 50 to 60 per cent.ofthe machinery was running.   One of the great troubles in this district was the fact that orders received were so small as tokeep machinery running only ten to twelve days at a&apos; time.In the Dewsbury district, blankets were not quite so good so they had been, and the piece  &quot;section in this district wasdecidedly quieter.   The spinning section was fairly wellemployed but the. outlook was no better than it was twelvemonths ago.  High prices were against new business all round.Speaking generally, Mr, Aykroyd thought there was satisfactionat the Budget proposals and people were pleased there waglikely to be some assistance to industry through the rates.     COL. WILLSY wrote:-     &quot;I have just returned from an extended tour of Italy,Austria, Poland and Germany, which enabled me to get in touchwith textile interests of a varied character.  As far as Wooltextile generally is concerned, one may say that there isstill considerable activity, machinery being well employed.There is, however, a reported difficulty of getting new business In weaving, so that when the old orders on a lowerbasis of values become executed, there Is some uncertainty asto the repeats on a higher level necessary to meet the rawmaterial advance.  Hosiery spinners all over are busy, and theconsumption Is reported as large.  In Vienna one heard ofconsiderable buying by Russia,     &quot;One notes that from all countries, there Is a very substantial export of yarn to Germany,   The deduction there-fore is that continued activity in most European exporting countries (and they nearly all, other than Germany^, exportworsted yarn) on balance is dependent largely on the continuedabsorption by Germany, and therefore on the continued generalvelocity of industrial production there.  Speaking generally,one gets the impression that the purchasing power for textilesthroughout Central and South-Eastern Europe is Increasing.Everywhere it is reported that there is a tendency towards afiner grade of material.  This involving the use o$; differentwool, is inclined to upset the balance of machinery.  It maybe that other uses for furnishings and upholstery will gradually develop, which would absorb the lower products.
   MR.- ADDISOR said that in, the home market there had been a healthy demand during the whole of the last month from almost every quarter, especially the Leicester district.  As regardsthe oversea markets, trade in South America had shown signs ofimprovement during the last two months, but in India and theNear East, where low grade materials could be used,  the producers in this country and in France and Italy,  were dumpingtheir less desirable products.  Business was very brisk in theUnited States.  In Germany producers had experienced a lull inFebruary and March, but there were signs of improvement now.In France and Italy production seemed to be rather hard to move.Producers in this country &quot;were, however, finding business quitesatisfactory.                          CHEMICALS.     MR. HILL stated that business in the chemical industry forthe month had been fairly well maintained in volume, and prices had on the whole been steady, with some changes in favour ofbuyers, for example, in tartaric acid, citric acid,  cream oftartar and lead acetate.  Reviewing the first quarter of theyear, a satisfactory advance was shown on the corresponding                        WOOL (CONTD).      &quot;in most Continental countries,  where  the  post-war  standard week has been reduced from 60  to 48 hours,  the  tendency  has been to substitute as the standard  practice  two  shifts of  eight hours. This of course has immensely increased  production,  and accounts for the increased ratio of wool  consumption on  the  Continent against the substantial decrease in this  country as against pre- war figures.   Factory laws permit continuous eight hour  operation without, in some countries, including cleaning  time.  This, therefore,  puts the Continental  practice  at a great advantage  as against Great Britain,  quite apart from a lower standard ofwages.      &quot;The effect of the increased production of synthetic fibre fabrics must  have a substantial  bearing upon wool product require-ments.   The British Rayon production  may  now be reported as equivalent  to roughly 380,000,000 lbs,  of Greasy Australian Wool.Already one is able to  visualise what influence a raw material based on relatively static price must have  as a balance  on futureprice fluctuations in vegetable  and animal  fibres.  It must have a  great effect on the economy of textile industries which havebeen based  on speculative raw  material  profits  rather than on determined  conversion margins  based on  industrial efficiency,, There is also the fact of comparable  attractiveness to distri- distributors  of such fabrics through the elimination  of price f luctuat ion&quot;.

Thelatter period was,  however, artificially inflated by  the buyingorders which had accumulated during the  period of the coaldispute.  On the whole,  volume had been  as well maintained asvalues.  Export trade showed a healthy if moderate increase.                       FOOD INDUSTRIES.     SIR STANLEY MAC BIN observed that the large wholesaledistributing houses found that,  while they were maintaining their business, there was no real development.  They were in about the same position as last  year.  There was,,  however, aslight Improvement in the export  trade in connection -with the sugar-using industries.  There the outlook undoubtedly appearedbetter.  Especially during the last few weeks there had been more life, the volume of trade had been better, and there was nodoubt that these industries would be helped by the concessions which sugar had received in the  Budget.   The export trade in thefood industries generally was improving.  We were  stillpractically shut out of Europe,  except for one or  two marketssuch as Holland.  The bigger markets in Italy, France andBelgium were entirely closed against us.  The preserved meattrades were quite satisfactory,  but there was trouble caused bya shortage of their raw material.  The miscellaneous foodpreserving trade showed an improvement,  week by week, in thehome market and was a shade better in the export market, but here again difficulties were being experienced through the hightariffs and repressive measures  adopted in foreign countries.In concludion. Sir Stanley expressed the viexv- that the substantial relief to industry proposed in the Budget had created an atmosphere In industry such as could not be recalledfor a generation or more, and he felt it would have a verybeneficial effect in the near future.GENERAL TRADE.     MR. VYLS thought that business in general in the north,  onthe Clyde and on the north east coast,  did not seem to beImproving very much.  From the north east  there had been somereports that it was a little difficult  to  get  money in,  whichwas always a bad sign.  The timber trade in the Liverpooldistrict was dull;  the building trade  which was practicallythe largest consumer, seemed to be abnormally  quiet,  althoughan improvement later on was hoped for.   April  had been a dullmonth in the tanning trade, everyone appeared  to be holding
                 GENERAL TRADE (CONTD) *back in the hope of lower prices; but again,  as had beenreported on previous occasions, very high hide prices were maintained by America and the Continent.  Generally, theredid not seem to be much change, but perhaps a very slowimprovement.     LORD GAINFORD stated that the recent monetary federal reserve policy in America was still having a very unsettlingeffect on the whole trade of this country, and so long as there was an artificial effort made In America to retain gold,there appeared to be a tendency in this  country against any marked resumption of the upward movement in trade which hadbeen anticipated a few months ago and which was then in evidence,The underlying situation in this country as a whole, however,remained sound.     With regard to particular industries in the woollen and worsted trade India and the Far Eastern markets had been takingmore piece goods lately.  Raw cotton had been fairly steady,but the anticipated revival had shown no signs of materialising.The pottery trade had been quiet, mainly due to the slowing down of demand during the Easter period.  In boots and shoes, theincrease in the price of leather was causing great difficulty,but the export trade had shown some improvement during themonth.  In hardware and cutlery competition continued keen andtrade during April had not been up to the level of the first three months of the year.  Engineering orders were coming in%at a slower rate than during the earlier months, but theposition of the electrical engineering section continued to be fairly satisfactory.     SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE stated that purchases in the generalretail trade had not been up to expectation,  and that most houses were only just holding their own.  The spending power of thepublic seemed to be less and they favoured lower values.Employment throughout the stores and retail trades generallyshowed an increase d&apos;ver last year.  Taking the sectionsindividually, the furnishing section showed well on acoount of-the better class houses which were being built.  Trade in theladies&apos; drapery section was very good.   Money waa still beingspent there.  The men&apos;s outfitting trade was not up to lastyear1s level;  it seemed that they were  economising.  Theprovision trade, also, was not up to the standard of last year,on  account of the lower prices, but there was one satisfactorypoint, more tonnage was being used.  Since Easter, however,business had improved and he felt, and there was an opinion inthe trade generally, that they would have a very busy time upto the end of the London season.
                     CONFIDENTIAL *                  GENERAL TRADE (OONTD.) .              Co-operative Wholesale Society,     MR, HAYHURST reported that the month of April did not, sofar as he could gather, reveal anything of a particularlyoutstanding character so far as his Society was concerned. Itsbulk sales still continued to show increases, and whilstthey might be considered satisfactory from a general stand-point, it was regrettable to find that, notwithstanding thata fair trade waa being done, the South Wales and northeastern districts of the country did not seem to improvevery materially in their general conditions. Sales of drapery,furniture, hardware and kindred goods had been satisfactory.The stocks held in the Society&apos;s various sections of thebusiness were of the usual quantity.     Butter.   A reduced enquiry for Danish from theContinent a week or so ago found its reflection in a reducedquotation.  New Zealand and Australian had continued to meet a steady trade, with a slight easement in values for the latter.The Irish Oroamery season had just opened, and so far thequality had been exceedingly good.  At the moment, supplies were on the scarce side, with the tone inclined to be firm.It was interesting to record that the Co-operative sales of butter during the past month shewed an increase in weight of12c/o over the corresponding period of last year.     Sugar.  British refined was reduced at the beginning oflast week, but even this reduction failed to arouseenthusiasm, the trade preferring to &quot;mark time&quot; pending thebudget.  It was expected that now there Would be a rush oforders.  The Society immediately gave effect to the changedue as a result of the budget reduction.     Flour.  Since last week&apos;s strong market, which resultedin an advance, the demand for wheat turned quieter.  Prices,however, did not ease, in fact being firmer&quot; that day owing totho sensational atmospherical reports from the United Statesof America,  At the moment there were no complaints ofSpring sowing conditions in Canada.  There were evidences of heavy speculations in future supplies of wheat, and professional speculators might perhaps unload If it turned out that the crop scares were not  justified.  Argentine todaywas the cheapest market.     Tea.  The market had continued generally steady, qualitybeing plain, but any tea of quality had met with strongcompetition.

OURRIE reported little change in monetaryconditions during the past month.  The three months&apos; Billrate had been maintained with difficulty in the neighbourhoodof 4joi but the market appeared to be working on a veryslender margin.  Indeed it had been necessary the previous day to have recourse to the Bank of England, an unusualoccurrence for the first day of the month.     The Stock Exchange had been active and there had been an increasing demand for government securities and  also forcertain industrial investments.  The percentage of  advanoesto deposits in the Banks had risen slightly.SHIPPING,     ME. ALEXANDER SHAW mentioned that the figures for april were not then available, but the Chamber of shipping had boen trying to form a rough estimate of the tonnage ofthe world laid up on 1st April last.  There were laid up at United Kingdom ports on 1st April 363,000 tons, asoompared with only 239,000 on 1st April of last year, avery considerable increase of well over 100,000 tons.Taking the world as a whole It was estimated that on 1stApril of this year there was a total of over 7 million gross tons of shipping of all kinds laid up, or about 11%of the world&apos;s total tonnage.  That included all theAmerican tonnage which would probably never sail the seasagain.  The figure wag, therefore, not ao valuable as itmight otherwise be.  The bottom seemed to have dropped out for the time of the Australian outward market.  Ships were leaving very often with half to two thirds of their spaceunfilled. The Australian homeward market, on account ofthe apple season, was better, but the freight figure was still practically at the pre-war level.  China remained a very poor market.
S     Shipowners thought,  on the  whole,  that  the  effect ofthe Budget provisions in regard  to rating would  be  graduallyto stimulate the heavy industries and so undoubtedly,  in course of time, to stimulate export and to provide  moreweight for their ships.   That, taken along with  thealleviation in the dock dues which might be  expected from  theprovisions in regard to the rating of(docks, had given rather a more hopeful tendency to shipowners&apos;  views within the lastweek or so.  Apart from these features trade at  the moment was bad for any time and unusually bad for this  time of theyear.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.     MR. HURCOivlB wrote : -          &quot;During the four weeks ended 22nd April the decreaseIn railway receipts, compared with the corresponding period, of1927, amounted to  700,000, of which  516,000 was due tomerchandise.  From the beginning of the year to 22nd April thecorresponding decrease in receipts amounted to nearly  2jfmillions, merchandi.se accounting for  1,180,000, and coal for 1,040,000.  The balance of rather more&apos; than  i million was due to the falling off in the receipts from passengers,          &quot;The rallT/ay statistics for February shewed a further increase in cheap ticket travel, which had increased the grossrevenue of the companies, but part of that Increase was dueto the extra working day.  A satisfactory feature in the passenger returns for the current year was the increase in thenumber of workmen conveyed.  The freight traffic conveyed by rail in February last shewed a decrease of over 1,600,000 tonsor 6 per cent.   As in January, the falling off was accountedfor mainly by coal, coke and patent fuel,which decreased tothe extent of 1,300,000 tons.EMPLOYMENT.     MR PHILLIPS said that during April there had been some risein the number of registered unemployed, largely owing toextended stoppages at Easter.   These stoppages were particularlymarked in coal and cotton.  There was a reduction in the figure for 23rd April, but this was still about 28,000 higher than thefigure for 26th March, and over 20,000 of this increaseconsisted of persons wholly unemployed.  He handed in a table(appended) showing the number of insured persons in employment.Between March and April, the total in employment (Includingpersons directly involved in trade disputes; had increased byabout 10,000 while the total in employment (excluding personsdirectly Involved In such disputes) had increased by about14,000.

SANDERSON stated that the pastoral and agriculturalconditions, generally speaking, were good in Australia, but ina large area in Queensland and a smaller area in New SouthWales there was still a good deal of anxiety about the drought,and some portions of North western Queensland were in a very bad condition.   The wool received in stores from the 1st july to the 31st March amounted to 2,295,919 bales - a decrease ofover 60,000 bales from the previous year - but there had been anincrease in the sales of about 30,000 bales.  The averageprices had been  25 a bale for greasy and  30 a bale forscoured,  Japan had been an active buyer throughout the season.  Bradford purchases, though extensive, were not asgood as they had been last season,  A direct demand had comefrom Russia last year, but It would remain to be seen whetherthis was to be a permanent factor or not.     The exports from the Commonwealth for the eight months ended 29th February were  99 million, which was an increase of nearly  2 million over the corresponding period of theprevious year;  the Imports were  105 million, a decrease ofover  6 million on the previous year.     The total
                AUSTRALIAN TRADE (CO NIP ).value of the overseas trade for 1926/27 was  309 million asagainst  300 million for the previous year.  Empire countriestook 44 per cent, of the exports and foreign countries 56 percent.  Great Britain took 33 per cent.     The estimated crop of i;iaize in Queensland was about fourand a half million bushels, and it was proposed to establish a pool for the whole State,  The cotton crop in Queenslandtotalled seven million pounds, and there was a strong demandfor such things as sheep skins and hides,  which were affectedby the increased prices in the leather market.     As a result of negotiations with the  commonwealth government, the British Shipping Companies had agreed to arebate of 2-j- per cent, on Australian butter and cheese shippedto Britain, the rebate only to be operative if 30,000 tons ormore were shipped during the next twelve months; but that amount had already been exceeded by 3,000  tons.  The bankclearances from 1st January to the 26th March were  546 millionagainst  369 million In the corresponding  period of theprevious year.  The Atlantic Union Oil Company was proposing toestablish works and organisations in Australia and New Zealandwith a capital outlay of nearly two million pounds; and negotiations were proceeding for amalgamation between theDunlop and Perdriau Rubber Companies.     Since the last Council meeting the sale of the AustralianCommonwealth Government Line had been announced.  There was aguarantee to retain the ships on the British register for tenyears; a guarantee to maintain the service or its equivalentsubject to ordinary maritime risks, etc. for ten years; anundertaking to augment the service as soon as this could resonably be done into a fortnightly serviee from Great Britain;an undertaking to agree to some form of board or representative body in Australia to be consulted before raising freights from australia;  the majority of shares in the  company were to beheld by natural born or British subjects;  the purchasers were tohave first preference in respect of carriage of any Government-controlled cargo for the period of ten years.     Mr. Sanderson had mentioned at a previous Council meeting a very large increase in the export of wines.  As a result therehad been some difficulty in the sales on this side.  Further,the High Commissioner writing to the Yorkshire Post on 26thApril, in reference to a statement about migration to Canada,had given some figures for 1925, 1926 and  1927 showing that thepercentages of emigration Into Australia of British hadamounted to 81 per cent, in 1925 , 85 per cent, in 1926, and 75per cent, in 1927;  whilst of Italian there had been 12 per cent.6 per cent, and 13 per cent.  Other nationalities were represented by quite small amounts.
CONFIDENTIAL.INDIAN TRADE.     MR.  GORDON observed  that the  balance  of  trade  for  the month  of  March continued  good and  amounted to  6-g crores in favour of India, making a total balance  for the financial year of about 50 crores against 40 crores  last year.  Rail- way earnings were  again good, and  up  to  17th March  were . 4t erores in excess  of what they had  been  in  the previous year for  the same  period.  The crop reports were still generally favourable, in  spite of  a few  local  set-backs, notably in the Central Provinces where the wheat had suffered considerably.  Indications -from the jute districts  for  next season&apos;s  crop were,  so far, satisfactory,  although  no official forecast  had yet been received.     The  last detailed returns also showed improvement  in United  Kingdom imports into India.  From the February trade figures the total  imports were seen to be-about 2 4-  crores higher  in value- than the  total imports in  February, 1927. Under  the heading  of machinery there was an increase of 38 lakhs  in  value,  of which  the United Kingdom share was 33 lakhs; under  iron and steel there was an increase of  45 lakhs,  of which  the United Kingdom  share was 17; under railway plant there was an increase of 25 lakhs, entirely from the United Kingdom,  and finally, out of 40 lakhs increase under cotton yarn and  piece goods the United Kingdom share was 29.   That is to say, out of an increase of 148 lakhs in four main items, the United Kingdom increase was 104.   That was a satisfactory proportion.  On the eleven months&apos;  figures there was an indication too that the progressive fall in United Kingdom trade to  India was showing signs of coming to a standstill. The British share in that trade had been falling for years. On the eleven months&apos; figure(s of last financial year the British proportion was 47.8$!,  as compared with 47. l  in the previous year,  so that it had actually recovered a little bit on the eleven months&apos; figures.     The cotton  trade was still the one that was giving anxiety in India;  and,  apart from the strikes in. the Bombaymills,  there was a continued increase in stocks,  which were now over one million bales, or 64 per cent higher than theyhad been last year.  The exports of cotton and cotton yarnhad decreased by about 9 crores and the imports increased by-g- crores.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.     MR. HOSE wrote     &quot;The trend of Argentine foreign trade during the current year,  to which I referred in my last report to the Council,continues to show expansion in the total value of exports,  evenin comparison with the high figures for 1927.   Moreover,  the
-SOUTH&quot; AMERICAN TRADE (CONTD . ) increased purchasing power  of the country resulting from  the heavy sale of export products since  the  commencement  of last year is evidenced in a substantial Increase  in  the values  of imports.  Official returns  show that the total  merchandise exports in the first two months of the  current  year were $207,595,000 (gold), against $187,756,000 in the  correspond- ing period of 1927, while imports aggregated $152,636,000 (gold), against $123,807,000.  It is of  interest  to observe that the increase shown  in  imports this  year is accounted for mainly by larger purchases of textiles and  similar, goods, coal, fuel-oil and lubricants, machinery, and vehicles, while all the other main groups of imports show slight advances in value.  The  favourable visible balance of trade was rather lower than a  year ago, at $54,959,000  (gold), against $63,949,000, but the economic position  of the Republic was greatly strengthened during January  and February, 1928, by an influx of gold  amounting to  no less than$40,405,400, as compared with only $420,000  in  the correspond- ing period of last year.  No exports of  the  precious metal took place in either period.     &quot;Harvesting of the early-sown maize in  the Republic  is progressing, and picking of the late-sown crop  has commenced. Estimates place the total surplus of the grain  likely to become available for export during the  current  season at as much as 5-g million tons, which, in view  of the  fact that  no supplies were carried over  from last season,  is a very satisfactory position from  the market standpoint.  Moreover, prices of wheat, oats, linseed and maize have all risen during the past month.     &quot;The general trade  situation in Chile remains depressed, but it is reported that  there are indications of  improvement in some directions.  An analysis of  present  conditions In  the import trade show that business in woollen goods  is very Inactive, and Is likely  to  remain so for a considerable time. The present state of this particular line of trade, and also of some others, Is making it more difficult  for the small firm to continue to import  direct, and  this  is  considered  in certain commercial circles  an advantage  for  the future.   In &quot;Manchester&quot; goods, the American manufacturers  are credited in some quarters with more  frequent  renewals  of designs and lower prices than the British firms,  and this may actually be the case, owing to the larger scale  on which production is carried on in the United States than in  this  country.  In  the Punt a Arenas districts, the wool seajson  is now well advanced, and the greater portion  of  the clip  has already been shipped, fleeces having been sold in London at very favourable prices.     &quot;Sales of nitrate of soda continue  to take place in Chile on a satisfactory scale, the total disposals from 14th April, 1927, to 15th April, 1928, for shipment from July, 1927, to June, 1928, being  2,956,767 metric  tons, while, including those contracted  for shipment  after the first half of the current year, the aggregate is no less than 3,233,893 metric tons.  These, sales,  however,  are being  effected at prices which barely yield a reasonable margin of  profit to the cheapest producers, and there can be no doubt that, even with the measures which have already been taken by the
                 SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE  (CONTP.)Chilean Government to cheapen production - such as the reduced import duties on nitrate bags  and lower railway rates -a large number of the companies are still selling stocks at prices yielding little or no net profit.  It must thereforebe regarded as an adverse factor for the immediate future ofthe nitrate trade that the Government, after having examined the question exhaustively, declares that it will not reduce,during the 1928-29 nitrate year, the export duties on the fertiliser at present in force.   At the same time, producerswill derive some measure of satisfaction from the fact thatthe authorities have declared their willingness to co-operate&apos;,so far as is legally possible, with the producers to re-organiseand expand the production and marketing of Chilean nitrate.At the present time, the greatest difficulty experienced is inthe shortage of labour, which is becoming a serious factor.     liThe feature of commercial conditions in Brazil duringthe past two months has been a revival of activity in the    *textile industry in Sao Paulo, where the mills, after havingbeen idle for an extended period, are now again working nearlyfull time.   Moreover, importers and manufacturers in the locality report that the expansion of  trade in evidence towardsthe end of 1927 is still being maintained.     &quot;The Sao Paulo Coffee Institute continues successfullyits control of the marketing of coffee, although the last cropwas very large.  Coffee continues to predominate in the nationalfortunes, the value of shipments thereof in 1927 constituting71 per cent, of the total exports of the Republic,  It must,however, be pointed  out that, as no very substantial increasein the volume of coffee shipments is to be expected in future years, it appears essential for Brazil to devote increasedattention to the production of other commodities for export,in view of the fact that the visible export trading surplustends to shrink substantially year by year, accompanied by adefinite increase in imports, especially invisible items such asthe service of the large loans contracted.  Therefore, it wouldappear that, with the natural commercial development of thecountry, the demand for imported machinery and industrial equipment should be greatly extended.  At the same time, a trade revival in Brazil is likely to cause an expansion in thenational manufacturing industries.  Already a number ofarticles, which formerly were always pur chased abroad, areproducer? locally, and, as the mamxfacturers1 experience grows,the foreign exporter will undoubtedly encounter more serious opposition, and this is a fact to which I feel it my duty to direct the attention of British exporters.     &quot;During .^pril last, a further loan was floated in theLondon market on behalf of Brazilian Interests,the amount being 1,000,000 in 7% Consolidated Bonds of the State of Parana^fiered.at 98 per cent.  The chief product of  the State is &quot;herva mate&quot;-the Brazilian tea,but a successful commencement has been made withthe production of coffee.  The loan met with immediate over-aabscriptnon                             -27-
              SOUTH AMERICAN TRAPS (CO NTD).     &quot;In Nicaragua, the political parties  are  at  presentactively proceeding with preparations lor  the  forthcomingCongressional elections, but the general political situationthroughout the country is tranquil.   The military operations inthe North of the Republic do not indicate  any  movement  ofimportance, and it is significant that,  despite the rejection of a special Bill, presented to the  NIcaraguan Congressunder United States auspices to provide  for the supervision of the elections by American interests,  arrangements have  beenmade whereby the voting will undoubtedly be carried out ina manner fully In accord with the proposals originally  made bythe United States Government.  In regard to general commercial conditions, it may be stated  that there are  atpresent some 3,000 United States troops  stationed  inNicaragua.  In the aggregate, their  monthly expenditureexceeds $300,000 and this addition to the  volume  of money  in circulation has naturally been of great  benefit to commerce.     uAn Increased volume of trade in coffee has  recentlybeen passing in Ecuador, and prices  leave  a satisfactorymargin of profit to the exporters.  Arrivals of cocoa fromthe producing centres, however, have been  abnormally small,and, although the economic situation is  still  inherentlysound, the movement of commerce in general is  extremely slow.     &quot;Shipments of coffee from Guatemala have  recently  takenplace on a heavy scale, and it is now estimated that no morethan 15 per cent, of the 1927/28 clip remains  to  be exported.On the Pacific Coast, very timely rains  have occurred duringthe past ten days, the fall having averaged four  to fiveinches.  The change to more satisfactory weather  conditionshas sufficed to produce heavier flowering  of the  coffeeplants than has been seen for five years.   In  some quarters,there are expectations of a record yield being gathered forthe next crop.&quot;
