document  is  the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Government).CABINET.I (28) .      LIQUOR (DISINTERESTED OWNERSHIP AND MAHAGEMENT)  BILL.               Memorandum by the Home Secretary.        It is necessary to determine the attitude which the  Government should adopt towards the Liquor (Disinterested  Ownership and Management) Bill introduced in the House of Lords  by Lord half our of Burleigh,  which is due for Second Reading on  June 20th.        There are two main principles embodied in the Bill.   First  that, given certain conditions, there should be substituted a  system of public ownership and management in the liquor trade  for the present sj^stem of private enterprise.   Second, that the  question whether such substitution should or should not be made . sb^uld. be left to be determined locally by a. poll.        Whatever be the merits  or demerits of the principles  involved, the Bill is not good as a workable proposition, and is  probably not susceptible of satisfactory amendment.   The  financial scheme alone, in regard to which the Treasury have  been consulted, presents very serious difficulties and. certainly  could not be accepted.   On that ground alone a Second Reading  could properly and, I think,  successfully be opposed, but it may  be the view of my colleagues  that the Government should go  further and take this opportunity of declaring publicly that they  are definitely opposed in principle to any extension of public  ownership and management in the liquor trade.   Not only would  such a declaration be welcomed by the Conservative Party generally,  but failure on the part of the Government to seize this occasion  to define their attitude - and the occasion will be regarded  a,s demanding no less - will certainly cause dismay.  Procrastination will only give rise to the hurtful suspicion  that the Government are coquetting with nationalisation of the  liquor trade as a practical policy.
I.  cj      Por myself, 1 am in favour of the Government coming out into the open on this question, but I think it only right to remind my colleagues of two considerations which might be thought to render such a course inadvisable.      First, that an extension of public ownership and managementhas at least been contemplated by the present Government.  In1925 I appointed, with the concurrence of the Cabinet, a committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Southborough, to consider thesystems of disinterested State management that were in practice,and to report whether the experience gained afforded grounds fortheir development.   The findings of the Committee wereinconclusive.   In the view of the Committee no case had beenmade for the extension of existing schemes to any other particular area or place, and as to the question of their more generalextension, the Committee observed that the problems involved,notably that of finance, lay outside the scope of their inquiry and they did not, therefore, take it into&apos; consideration.   If theGovernment oppose the principle of this Bill, they willindubitably have to face the criticism that they have rejectedout of hand, a proposal which, in 1925, they considered to be one deserving of inquiry.      The second consideration which should be borne in mind isthat there are already in practice in three districts - Carlisle,Gretna and Groraarty Firth - schemes of disinterested Statemanagement of the liquor trade.   These schemes have long beenestablished and the Southborough Committee found that they had produced results of value and deserved to be encouraged.  It-maybe difficult to reconcile opposition to the principle of theBill with the findings of the Committee, and indeed,  with thecontinuance of the existing schemes.      As regards the existing schemes, I would like to sound onenote of caution.   We may have our own views as to the wisdom orunwisdom of the policy which resulted in their establishment,
but there can, I think, be no question, at any rate at thepresent moment of their discontinuance.   If the Government indefining their attitude to the Bill convey an impression of hostility to the Carlisle and other schemes, uncertainty willbe created as to the Government&apos;s intention in regard to them.This would not, I think, be in the interests either of thecommunity as a whole or of the liquor trade, and I would suggestthat opposition to the Bill should be coupled.with specificassurances regarding the continuance of existing schemes.                                W.J.H.11th  June,  192B.
