CONSERVATIVE AND UNIONIST CENTRAL OFFICE,                              Palace Chambers,                                  We s tminster,  S 0W c&quot;l,                                         12th May, 1928.My dear Prime Minister,     Following upon the  decision taken by the  Government Inregard to the removal  of the ban upon the broadcasting ofcontroversial matter,  the British Broadcasting Corporationwrote to me, as Chairman of the  Conservative Party,  in march last, informing me that  they had been approached  by Mr. arthur henderson on behalf of the Labour Part3r with a view to thobroadcasting of an address by Mr,  Ramsay MacDonald, when apronoun.cement would be made In connection with the  next GeneralElection.   The British  Broadcasting Corporation  went  on to saythat they had informed Mr, Henderson that  they proposedcommunicating with the offices of  the  Conservative  and LiberalParties to&apos; the effect  that they were  prepared  to  give  an equalopportunity to each for  a political  speech,  either  from apublic platform or from  one of their  studios.   They accordinglyenquired what arrangements I would, like  to make for a  similaropportunity.                               -1-                                                    Mil &quot;&apos;im ijiiiijfia I taps&quot; &apos; ?-:HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT) *
      In my reply to  the  British Broadcasting Corporation I suggested  that  before  any isolated engagements  were  undertaken it would be to  the benefit  of  all  concerned if  the British Broadcasting Corporation could draw tip  rules of general application which would  enable, the  various  political parties  . to know  the scope of the privileges to  which they would be entitled,  and make their plans  accordingly.      In  response  to  this suggestion. Sir  John Reith  wrote me a  letter of  which I attach  a  copy.   From this it will  be seen  that  the scheme which he  proposed  on behalf of  theBritish  Broadcasting Corporation was as follows    (a)  For  an initial  period of three weeks each of the            three  parties  should  be  given  an  opportunity            of arranging  for an uncensored enunciation of            Party  policy,,  lasting for half an hour, the            Parties following each other in successive weeks:    (b)  After  this  period of three weeks the system should be            put  upon  a fortnightly basis,  In  the  rota of a            Government spokesman  to  each Opposition spokesman:    (c)  That the system should  continue  until  the            dissolution of Parliament, subject to special            arrangements  being made  by agreement  between      -r-- : .  the  Parties during the periods when  the Rouse of            Commons would not be  in  session:    (d)  that, during the General Flection the general            principle should be that each  Party  should have            equal  facilities, arrangements being  decided            upon latero     As  these proposals were obviously completelysatisfactory from the point of view of the conservative party, I informed Sir John Reith that they met with myentire approval,  and suggested as regards the question  of the holiday  seasons that the most convenient arrangement  mightbe for this aspect of the proposals to be discussed bythe Whips of the three Parties concerned.     I have now been informed by Sir John Reith over  the telephone,  that the  Liberal Party objects to&apos; the proposals in,principle,  particularly to the suggest ion that, -&quot;the Okj^earrnmetrt&apos;-should bo allowed time for time with each -of &quot;the^Opposition                             -2-
t Parties.   The Liberal Party have accordingly asked the British Broadcasting Corporation to arrange for a joint conference at which two representatives of each of the three Parties should be present.      The Labour Party have agreed in principle to the proposals, but have also asked for a conference to decide certain points of detail.   Sir John Reith accordingly asked me to nominate two repreFientatives to attend a conference next week.      I have discussed the situation which has arisen with the  Chief Whip, and we both feel that before we take any further stops in the matter we ought to be armed with higher authority, and ought to have some guidance from the Cabinet as to the lines which we should pursue in regard to this suggested conference0      If such a conference be held there can be little  doubt that  the main issue will be joined on the  question whether the system Should be  based on the  rote, of a Government spokesman to each  Opposition spokesman,  or  whether the  Liberal,  Labour  and Conservative  Parties should follow each other in rotation.    I for my part  feel  that  we  ought  to adhere  to  the  proposals put up by the British  Broadcasting Gorporaiion on  their own initiative.    The  Liberal Party may contend  that they  will bevattacking the Labour Party  as well as  the  Government but in practice  the  tendency  will  be for both  the Opposition  Parties to spend most of  their time  attacking  the  Government.   That being the case,, the  Government  ought  in my view to  have opportunities of  replying to each of  them  in turn,  as  suggested by the  British  Broadcasting  Corporation, and that we ought not to give way to  the  Liberal  demand.    It Is obvious, however, that  the  difference  of view which I have indicated  may  raise political issues  upon  which we  ought  to have  the guidance of the  Cabinet.                          Yours  sincerely,                             (Signed)   J.C.C. DAVIDSON.The Rt.Ron.Stanley Baldwin, M.P.,    10, Dow nl ng   t r e e t, S:, W. I.
           BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION              Savoy Hill,  London,  W.C 2,                                     19th April, 1928.The.Rt.Ron. J.C.C. Davidson,  C.H,,C,M.P,,   Conservative and Unionist  Central Office,      Palace Chambers,         Westminster, S.W.I.Bear Sir,     In further reply to your letter of 29th March, we havegiven careful consideration to the broadcasting of controver-sial political speeches, and we should be  glad to have youropinion with respect to the following suggested experimentalprocedure  :-     lie propose,  in the first  instance, to  place at thedisposal of the Chairman of each  of the three Parties one half hour  a week; with one week between the occasions, for anuncensored enunciation of  Party policy in  general, and thereafter to  permit the broadcasting of half an hour1suncensored speech on the same  night of the week at fortnightlyIntervals, in  the rota  of  a Government spokesman to eachOpposition one, this latter procedure to  continue  fortnightly,at any  rate  when  the House is  sitting, until the dissolution of the  present Parliament.    During the General Electionperiod,  we propose  to  adopt  the former procedure Indicated,namely,  equal  opportunity  for each ..if the three Parties, thereafter reverting to  what  might be termed  the normal procedure  -  that  is, one  Government  speaker to  each Opposition speaker.      To sum up,  we propose to offer  equal facilities  to the three Parties, in successive  weeks (as  an introduction to  the
S2broadcasting of political controversy) on the understandingthat these occasions would be used for enunciations of party policy in general;  similar facilities during theGeneral Election period;  and, as a routine arrangementthroughout the year (or at any rate whan Parliament is in session) equal opportunity to the Government of the day with both parties in Opposition at fortnightly intervals.     We might mention that, as in the past, we propose tocontinue to broadcast the Government speeches at the lord mayor&apos;s Annual Banquet.   If permission were given to broadcast from the House of Commons, we should transmitdirect the speech of the Chancellor cf the Exchequer whenintroducing the Budget  as a statement of Government policy;in the event of permission to broadcast from the Housestill being declined, we should enable the Chancellor togive a factual and, as  far as possible, non-controversialstatement from the  studio on the night following theintroduction of the Budget.   It may be that certain otherexplanations of Government intention would be broadcast,either from the House or a studio, without being regardedas  controversial occasions involving Opposition speeches in reply.     We  should^be glad  to hear from you with respect tothese proposals, in order  that the matter may be consideredby  the Board In light of your comments at the earliestpossible  date o                         Yours faithfully,                             /    1   T OT  Tirr--rmrT                               Direct or-Genera1.
