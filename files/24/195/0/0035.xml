June 1928.SECRET.Copy  No.   28CP. 185 (28).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE HERALDS&apos; COLLEGE.                                  REPORT.   -  AT their Meeting on the 19th October,  1927 (Cabinet 51 (27),  Conclusion 5), the Cabinet agreed that a Cabinet Committee composed as follows          The Right Hon. The Earl of Birkenhead (Chairman),         The Right Hon. W. C. Bridgeman, M.P.,         The Right Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bart., G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P.,         The Right Hon. Lord Eustace Percy, M.P.,         The Right Hon. The Earl of Cromer, G.C.I.E.,  G.C.V.O.,         The Right Hon. Viscount Fitzalan, K.G., G.C.V.O., D.S.O., should be appointed to consider the constitution and present working of the Heralds&apos; College and to make recommendations for their improvement.     2.  We submit the following Report embodying the  results of the inquiry  which we have conducted in accordance with our terms of reference.  The facts have been fully laid before us in memoranda and other documents prepared  by the  Home Office, the Scottish Office and the College of Arms; the  case of the College has been supplemented by oral evidence  given  on its behalf by  Garter  Principal  King of English Arms and other Officers of the College. We have also heard  evidence from the  Permanent  Under-Secretary of State  for the Home Department;  from the Permanent Under-Secretary of  State  for  Scotland  respecting the  constitutional position of the Lyon Office  and the relations  between that Office and the Secretary of State for Scotland,  and  from the Controller of the  Establishments Department of the Treasury relative to  proposals for the reorganisation of the  College  with especial reference to the question of the future  basis  of the remuneration of the Officers of Arms.     3.  The facts as to the College of Arms, the  relations of the College with the Earl Marshal, the functions and duties of the Officers of Arms, and the manner of their remuneration  are  set out  in  the Report dated the 29th July, 1903, of the Honours Committee, which was appointed by Treasury Minute of the 3rd November, 1902, to  inquire inter alia into  the constitution,  duties and administration of the College.  The relevant  extracts from this Report  will  be found in the Appendix hereto.   Effect  was given  to  the unanimous recommendations  of  the Honours Committee regarding certain of the fees payable to the Officers of the College.  a minority of  the  Honours Committee reported in  favour  of  the conversion of the College into a Civil  Service Department;  the  majority of the Committee, however, thought that a proposal to convert the whole or a sufficient number  of the Officers of Arms into salaried servants of the State was then  impracticable, and no action wasever taken on this suggestion.    4.   We desire at the outset  to state that,  in our opinion, the ceremonial dutiesentrusted to the Earl  Marshal  and the Officers  of  Arms have  throughout  beenperformed with conspicuous success and dignity, and we  are agreed  that the existing arrangements regarding the  ceremonial functions of the  Officers  should be main-tained, as at present, under the Earl Marshal, whose position in this respect shouldbe in no way changed or affected.      [17803]
     5.  We do not think it necessary or desirable to comment on the various matters to which reference was made in the Memorandum* circulated by the Home Secretaryto the Cabinet beyond stating that, in regard to certain of these matters, the college of Arms are prepared to adopt the views of the Home Office, and in regard to otherswe have received explanations and assurances.  As a  result of our investigations,we have come to the conclusion that the real question for determination is whetherthe fact that the Officers of Arms are remunerated in respect of their public functionson a fee and  not  on a salary  basist is mainly responsible  for  (1) the friction and difficulties which have arisen from&apos; time to time in the past between GovernmentDepartments  and  the College,  and  (2)  any misgivings the public may entertain inregard  to  the possibility of conflict between  the private interests and  the  publicduties of the Officers of Arms.     6.  The  emoluments of the  Officers of Arms  (Kings  of Arms, Heralds andPursuivants)  are derived from three sources :       (i.)  Nominal salaries payable from the Civil List.      (ii.)  Profits arising from the exercise of the duties entrusted to the College,           under  its charter in  relation to  the granting of  armorial  bearings,           licences for change of name, &amp;c.     (iii.)  Profits from genealogical work, investigation of pedigrees, &amp;c.     No question has arisen in  regard to  (i).   The  work under (iii)  representsbusiness carried on for their private clients in their individual and personal capacityby the Officers.  In regard to this &quot;private practice,&quot;  the Officers are at liberty tomake what charges they think fit.  No modification of this system is, in  our view,required.     Broadly speaking, the business under (ii) is concerned with the following classesof cases:      A.  Grants of armorial bearings pure and simple.     B.  Grants or Royal Warrants of or for              Change of name  and  arms.             Supporters.             Foreign Titles.             Precedences.     Apart  from  the question of jurisdiction  in  cases of disputed  domicile, nocontroversy has arisen in regard to A so far as grants of armorial bearings to private individuals are concerned, but objection has been taken to  the recent extension ofthe practice of granting badges to Local Authorities.  Subject to this, the friction and difficulties to which  our attention has been drawn have  arisen on  the itemsunder B.     The average annual number of grants under A is 200 and under B about 9,and out of the total profits  received by the Officers from A and B  together about97 per cent, comes  from the  A or non-controversial  area and only about 3 per cent.from the  B or controversial area.    We think that individual Officers of Armsshould cease to have  any direct financial interest in the &quot;B&quot; Grants, and that infuture the fees received in respect of those Grants  should be wholly devoted to thegeneral purposes of the College.     7.  We realise the force of the criticisms  which have been  directed against thepresent fee basis of remuneration of the Officers of  Arms, but we are satisfied  thatthe financial and other objections to placing all or  even a few of the Officers on a fixed salary outweigh any advantages which might  be expected to result from thechange.     8.  While we do not recommend  that the  existing basis  of remuneration ofthe Officers of Arms should  be altered, we are agreed that certain changes should now be  introduced in the administration and working of the College with a view to securing satisfactory co-ordination in all matters affecting Government departments and the College, and the  removal of any causes of future misunderstanding andfriction.   Our  proposals  in the matter have  been framed  with a  view to the avoidance  of  legislation which would  certainly be  contentious  and embarrassing.We are advised that they can be brought into  force without recourse to legislation,and we recommend their acceptance on that understanding.* CP. 242 (28).
9 0 fti-j \3 w     PROPOSALS FOR SECURING SATISFACTORY  CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN THE              COLLEGE  OF ARMS AND GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.   I.  That a Standing  Inter-Departmental Committee,  consisting of representa- iives of the College of Arms and of the Government Departments concerned, be (stablished, to which should be referred for discussion all  questions relating to any- work of the College which affects (i) touching  the exercise of the Prerogative for ifliich the Home Secretary or other Ministers  are constitutionally responsible for advising the Crown, or (ii) Government policy at home or abroad.   II. That the Earl  Marshal should be  invited to issue instructions to the College-   (A.)  That in future no Petition to the Crown be prepared by an Officer  of Arms         without previous consultation with the Home Office.   (B.) That in future all Fees payable in respect of Grants or Royal Warrants         of or for &apos;             Change of name  and arms,             Hereditary Supporters to Baronets,             Foreign Titles,             Precedence,         should be paid to the College Sustentation Fund and  devoted to general         College purposes.   (C.) That a fixed  sum should be deducted from the Fee  chargeable by the         College for a Royal  Licence in, the  case of a petitioner who draws up         and presents his own Petition.   (D.) That no Fees  should in future be charged to representatives of the Law         Officers and other Government Departments or  Officers of the Houses of         Parliament seeking official information from the Records of the  College,         and that every facility should be given to them in such cases.   (E.) That in any case of doubtful or mixed domicile there should be consultation         between the College and Lyon or Ulster, as the  case may be, before steps         are taken to make any grant or  to  act  as  agent in  connection with  a         grant, and that in  cases  of disputed jurisdiction  the  wishes of the         applicant should prevail.   III.  That the Earl Marshal should be invited to give further consideration to tie question of the  Grant of Badges to Local Authorities  in the light of the HomeSecretary&apos;s representations. In the event of it being decided to continue the  practiceof granting such Badges, no action in an individual case to be taken without previous consultation with the Home Office, and any Fees receivable in respect of Grants ofBadges to be paid to the College Sustentation Fund and devoted to general Collegepurposes.   IV.  That the Home Secretary be invited to refer  future Petitions for changeof name and arms to Garter only for report, instead of to the three Kings of Arms,so as to ensure that no Officer of Arms be asked to report on a Petition in the successd which  he may be interested.               THE  COLLEGE OF  ARMS  AND  PUBLIC  OPINION.   9. While there  is little evidence to show that  at the present time the publicptertains any serious misgivings on the subject of the remuneration of the Officers\i Arms, we feel that if the College is to continue to retain the confidence and esteempf the general public and outside experts, it  is essential that the Officers of Armsjjtithout exception should  possess the requisite academic and technical qualificationsM their posts in a high degree.  We suggest    (a.)  That the Earl Marshal should consider the best method of ensuring that         due regard is  had to this consideration in the case of future vacancies,         and   (b.)  That before submitting names to His Majesty for  appointment  to  the         College of Arms, the Earl Marshal should consult with the Master of the         Rolls and also with academic and historical authorities of distinction.   We also consider    (c.)  That a printed list of fees charged by the  College should be available for         public information.
10.  -We accordingly recommend the Cabi net-       To approve -the proposals for the improvement of the working of th      College of Arms set out in  paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Report on %      understanding that no legislation will be required.(Signed)      BIRKENHEAD.

THE following extracts from the  Report,  dated  the 29th July, 1903, of the Honours  Committee, appointed  by the Lords  Commissioners  of His  Majesty&apos;s Treasury, relate to the Heralds&apos;  College, and are circulated to the Committee for information :       Treasury Minute, dated November 3, 1902, appointing the Committee.    The  First Lord of  the  Treasury  recommends  to  the Board  that a  small Committee be appointed to inquire into the constitution,  duties and administration of the Heralds&apos; College, the Courts of.Lyon and Ulster Kings at Arms, and the Chanceries of the several Orders  of Knighthood,  and into  the origin, nature and amount of all charges whatsoever incident upon the bestowal by the  Sovereign of hereditary or  other Honours;  and to report whether any changes are advisable in connection with administration or otherwise.    My Lords concur and propose that the Committee should  consist of the following gentlemen :             The Right Hon. Sir Algernon West, G.C.B. (Chairman),           His Grace the Duke of Norfolk, K.G.,          -  The Viscount Esher, K.C.B.,  K.C.V.O.,            Major-General Sir Arthur E. A.

(Not reproduced.)                 PART II.-THE COLLEGES OF ARMS.                          THE HERALDS&apos;  COLLEGE.    The ILeralds&apos;  College was originally incorporated by Richard III., though theexisting Uorporation dates only from Mary.  Prior to the accession of Richard III.,the Officers of the College appear to have been independent of one another.    Since 1597, the  staff has consisted of 3 Kings of Arms (Garter, Clarenceux,Norroy), 6 Heralds, 4 Pursuivants.    They are appointed by the  Crown on the nomination of the Earl Marshal, whois responsible for directing them in the exercise of their duties.  Of the Kings ofArms, Garter claims to be the &quot; chief and principal &apos;&apos; and entitled  to special fees.      [17803]                                                         c
The Letters Patent under which he is appointed, to this Office create him at the sametime Principal Officer of Arms of the Order of the Garter.  Clarenceux and Norroyhave jurisdiction south and north of the Trent respectively.  It is in the power ofthe King to issue any future patent to Garter in such terms as he thinks fit.    It is hardly  within the compass of our enquiry  to trace  the importance in olddays of Kings of Arms and Heralds.  It will be sufficient to  remark, that formerlytheir duties were no doubt of much consequence, not only because the supervision ofall State ceremonies, pageants, and tournaments rested  with them, but because, inthat capacity, it was  their business to ascertain the competency of any one whoclaimed to  take part therein.  And as, in order to be able to decide upon any suchclaim,  it was necessary for them to be acquainted with the  arms and pedigree ofthe principal  families, the Crown granted to the Heralds the right, of visitationfrom house to house within their respective&quot;districts; and, armed with this power,and having the above-named object in view, they became, in a  manner, the registrarsof the births, deaths,  and marriages  of all  the leading families of the  Kingdom.It was stated to us that their visitation books were compiled  when these progresseswere regularly made for the purpose of inquiring into the state of the families, andfor registering such marriages as were verified on oath, and  had been admitted as evidence of pedigree in peerage claims.  Such functions as may have been performedin former days in these respects by the College have, however, been superseded byoffices of more modern creation. .    As regards the functions of the Officers in the present day, they are called upon,as household  servants of the Crown under the Earl Marshal, to order  and conductall public funerals and  state ceremonials, such  as coronations and  others.   their main occupation, however, consists in the exercise of the powers which the Collegepossesses, under  its charter, in relation to  the granting of armorial bearings andlicences for change of name, &amp;c, supplemented by the business carried on for privateclients  in  connection  with the investigation  of pedigrees,  and the  collection  ofevidence in support of them.                              FEES  AND SALARIES.    The fees payable to the Earl Marshal are given in Table  I, Appendix D.*    The sources from which the Officers of Arms derive the emoluments which accrue to them from their respective Offices.are as follows :               (1.) Salaries.             (2.) Waiting money.           &apos;  (3.) Fees on creations of dignities.             (4.) Fees in connection with ceremonials.             (5.)i Fees payable by Knights of the Garter  on installation.             (6.) Fees on grants of arms, crests, &amp;c.    An income is also derived by the Officers in respect  of the work connected withthe investigation of pedigrees already referred to, but this is quite distinct from theirCollege duties.    (1.) Salaries. These are paid to them as household servants of the Crown, outof the  Civil List.  Particulars will be found in Appendix D, Table II.*    (2.)  Waiting- Money consists of payments made by the public for searches, officialextracts from records, paintings  of  arms,  &amp;c.  The fees for  searches, &amp;c, areregulated from time to time by order of the Chapter of the College of Arms;  the feefor a  simple search being 5s.  and a general search through the records 42s.   Thesefees were in force 1st  March, 1838.  It is the duty of the Officers in Waiting, who receive the above Waiting fees, to carry out the searches, &amp;c.    (3.) Fees  on Creations  of  dignities. Particulars  of  these will  be found  inTable  III of Appendix D.*  They  have been in force from a  very early period, andthe records of their partition amongst the  Officers  of Arms are contained in the books  of the Office in regular sequence from the reign  of Henry VIII.  They areclaimed by the several Officers (as are all the fees payable to  them) by virtue of theterms  of the Letters Patent under  which each holds  his appointment.  Thus : theKings  of  Arms  are entitled under their  Patents, to   &quot;all rights,  fees, profits,commodities, advantages, and emoluments whatsoever to the same office in any wisebelonging  of  appertaining.&quot;  The Heralds are similarly entitled  to the  &quot; fees,perquisites, privileges, &amp;c, advantages and emoluments whatsoever to such  officeincident and belonging or in any manner appertaining.&quot;  The Pursuivants to the&quot; fees,  commodities,  profits,  advantages,   pre-eminences,  emoluments,   rights,                              * NOTE. Not reproduced.
perquisites,  liberties,  and privileges, whatsoever  due and  accustomed to the sameoffice.&quot;  Fees on creation have been collected by the Home Office from the recipientsof the dignities, transmitted to the Treasury and paid over by the latter Department(less 2J per cent, for collection) to the  Heralds,  on a certificate  from  the  CrownOffice and others entitled to them since 1871.  Formerly they were collected by theCrown Office, and the Account Books in  that Department show the collection of the fees and payment of  the same to the Heralds from 1783.   The records do  not go back beyond that  date.   No  duties  are  performed by the  Officers of Arms inconnection with these  fees.   (4.) Fees in connection with  ceremonials. They are  of  ancient origin  andparticulars will be found in Appendix D, Table IV.*   (5.) Fees payable by Knights of the Garter on installation. Details will be seen in. Appendix D, Table V*   (6.) Fees  payable  on  grants  of arms,  crests,  &amp;c. Particulars  appear  inAppendix D, Table VI.*   We have carefully considered the various questions connected with the Heralds&apos;College, the Officers of which, as has been already  stated, are individually under thecontrol of the Earl Marshal.   For the purpose of making our views clear with regard to the several descriptions of fees payable  to the  College, we have divided them as hereunder into six divisions,appending in each case our recommendations as to how they should be dealt with :        1.  Fees payable to  the Officers of the College on the creation of Peerages,   Baronetcies, Knighthoods Bachelor,  Consecration of Bishops,  and Installations.   of Knights of the Garter (Appendix D, Tables III and V*).   Our general views   with regard to the payment of charges in connection with Dignities have already   been expressed, and we are of opinion that these fees  should cease  to be paid.   The claims of the Officers under their Patents have been already explained,  and   the fact pointed out that since 1783  the fees have been collected and  paid to the   Heralds by Government.  They would seem,  therefore,  to have a strong claim   to compensation for any loss they may suffer. (x)       2.  Fees payable to  the Fund for the Sustentation of the  College  under   Warrant of King George IV., 1820, on the creation of Peerages, Baronetcies,   and Knights Bachelor (Appendix D, Table III*).  These, we think, should at   once cease, no claim to compensation arising,  and we have gladly received from   the Earl Marshal an intimation that the College would be prepared to meet the   views of the Committee on that point. (2)       3.  Fees payable to  Garter (separate  fees)  (Appendix  D,  Table III*).   These  should be  dealt  with in the same manner as those referred to under   No. l.(3)       4.  Fees payable for  &quot; Certificate  of Registration&quot;  in the  case of  a   Baronetcy  (Appendix B, Table IV*).  These should cease  to be payable,  the   warrant of 1783  under  which they  are now  charged being superseded or   annulled.^)       5.  Fees payable for  attendance  at State Ceremonials  (Appendix  D,   Table IV*). There seems no reason why these should not continue to be payable   whenever they are required by His Majesty to attend, being payment for services   rendered. (5J       6.  Fees payable for Grants of Arms, &amp;c. (Appendix D, Table  VI*).   We   considered  whether  our  enquiry should include questions connected with  the   College beyond those of the fees referred to in the first five divisions,  but having   come to the conclusion that the Earl Marshal is really the only authority to deal   with matters connected with Grants of Arms, &amp;c, we refrain from  entering   into details, either with  regard to  the sums now charged  in respect of such   grants,  or the general practice in connection with them, as we are informed by   the Earl Marshal that he has the constitution  and practice of the College under   consideration with a view to alterations.(6)                            * NOTE. Not reproduced.  .0), Fees surrendered in consideration of an annual  grant of  450 from Public Funds by way oftompensation.                              -  (2) The 1820 Warrant was revoked by Eoyal Warrant of the 20th March, 1905.  (*) Abolished. ,  (*) The 1783 Warrant was repealed by the Baronetage Ordinance of the 8th February, 1910.  (5) These stand.  (6) No action recommended.     [17803]                                                          n
     Some of us think that the officers of the College of Arms should be placed, on tW footing  of  salaried servants of  the State, but  others  of  us feel that there  art objections.  At present the discipline,  control,  and  regulation of fees are in  the hands of the Earl Marshal by virtue of his  office.   The suggested rearrangement of the office would, if effected in the manner in which the Scottish and Irish offices have been dealt with, give to the Treasury the regulation and  receipt of the fees but would leave the English office practically outside their control as to the discipline and conduct of its officers, unless the authority of the Earl Marshal is taken from him,     Apart from this there appear to be certain difficulties  connected with such an arrangement.  If it is to  be  a  Government Office, it is  clear that all the duties it performs must be of a public character.  Some functions of the  Heralds are of a public character,  e.g.,  the presence of Garter King of Arms or his  deputy at  the introduction of peers in the House Of Lords, and the part played by Heralds wit! reference to  Coronations, Proclamations, and  the like.   These events, however,  are rare, and on the most important occasions the responsibility has been in fact borne by special Committees.  It might even be thought that the services rendered on those occasions are not indispensable  and depend on in any event His Majesty requiring them.  The Kings of Arms have under their patents duties to perform in connection with the granting of arms and  so forth.  The Heralds hold their  offices by patents which describe their rights in general terms.  We have been referred to a warrant of King George the Third dated 9th May,  1804, wherein it is stated  to be the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown that &quot; the Kings, Heralds,  and Pursuivants of  the College of Arms have the  original cognisance  of  Pedigrees and Coat Armour, and that the  genealogist of the  Order  of  the Bath could not  properly  receive  any evidence of  pedigrees  or Coat Armour to be  entered in  his books  except  from  the College of Arms.&quot;  There are other duties undertaken by the Heralds in the nature of private practice, such as the compilation and investigation of pedigrees and  the like.  This class of work could not be undertaken by the Heralds if they were in  the position of  Civil servants.  It  would be difficult  to  arrange for  such work being carried out under,the control of a Government  Department, and  it would be a novel departure in England to invest the results of such investigations with the authority which a Departmental approval  ought to carry.  The control would either be nominal or unjustifiably expensive, and the authority would be liable to dispute.  It is obvious that such results could  not receive the practical guarantee which ought to attach to State decisions.     Again,  it might  not  unreasonably  be argued that, if the State, after  due investigation, assigned  a right (e.g.,  to bear certain Arms) to an individual, it ought to secure that right  by punishing infringement;  any such claim would in present circumstances be widely resented and impossible to enforce.  It would, moreover, be very anomalous for one Department of the State to be granting a right to individuals to bear specific Arms, whilst another Department (the Inland Revenue) was issuing licences to use armorial bearings entirely irrespective of questions of right.     If investigations of pedigree, &amp;c, were  excluded  from  the  functions of  the proposed  Government  Department,  it is doubtful whether  it would pay  its way. The  offices of Lyon King of Arms and Ulster  King of Arms, which are now Civil Departments of State, would  be scarcely, if at all, self-supporting if the fees paid on the creations of Knights of the Thistle, St.  Patrick, and  Knights Bachelor were excluded from their returns.     It is doubtful whether a proposal to convert the College of Arms into a Depart-ment of  State  could be carried out  without legislation,  and  the  passage througlParliament of a Bill  for  this purpose  could  not be otherwise  fhan controversial and  would be attended with  difficulty.  If, on the other hand,  the office  could be re-constituted by Royal warrant or  otherwise, under a  personal authority of the King,  it may well be considered undesirable  to  involve the  Sovereign  in such a question.     On weighing the  above  considerations we feel compelled to  report that  the proposal to convert the  whole  or a sufficient number of the officers of the College ot Arms  into salaried  servants  of  the  State  is  at  the  present  time  and in presentcircumstances impracticable, but we  think  that due consideration should be givenby the Earl Marshal  to the question when the issue of patents to fresh officers of the College is in contemplation.     (The remainder of the Report dealt with the Court and Office of the Lyon king of Arms in Scotland  and the Court and Office of Ulster King of Arms, Ireland.)
ij    The Report was signed by all the members of the Committee, but in the cases ofLord Esher, Sir Schomberg McDonnell and Sir Arthur Ellis subject to the following(reservation : I    &quot; We agree with the foregoing Report, with the exception of that  portion of itIffhich has reference to the Heralds&apos;  College.  In our judgment it is not desirablethat such work as is now entrusted to the College should be performed  by a privateCorporation..  A very large number of persons exist who have occasion, on groundsother than those of mere  sentiment, to make research into  their heraldic familyhistories and  pedigrees; and certain Officers of  the College  derive large incomesfrom fees payable  in respect of such research.  Garter King of Arms already does alarge amount  of work for the Government and is consulted by the Prime minister as to the titles  to be  taken  by all recipients of  hereditary honours;  he receives,however, no payment in respect of such work; this system is, we consider, open to^objection.  It appears  to us that in order to ensure the best administration  andfinancial control of the College,  its  Officers should be placed on the same footing asLyon and Ulster Kings of Arms;  we therefore recommend :     (1.)  That the Officers of the College of Arms should become salaried servants of         the State under the immediate control of the Treasury, the Earl Marshal         remaining the head of the College;    (2.)  That all  Officers  of  the  College be  appointed by  the  Crown  on   the         recommendation of the Earl Marshal;    (3.)  That they be paid fixed salaries for the performance of their duties and be         pensionable;    (4.)  That all charges for private  practice  be paid to the Exchequer.   It is for the Law Officers of the  Crown to determine whether legislation would benecessary to effect this change.&quot;29th July, 1903.
