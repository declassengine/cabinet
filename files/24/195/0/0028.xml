STRENGTH AND ORGANIZATION OF THE CAVALRY OF                                THE LINE.                         (C.I.D.  Paper No. 872-B.)    THE COMMITTEE  had under consideration  a report by  Lord Salisbury&apos;s Sub-Committee on the Strength  and Organization of the  Cavalry (C.I.D.  PaperNo. 872-B).    THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that, in the absence of any disagreement,the Committee should submit the Report to the Cabinet, with a recommendation thatit should be approved.    SIR GEORGE MILNE suggested  that the Chancellor of the Exchequer musthave been under a misapprehension when making his Note appended to the Report,as all the things he advocated were now being done as far as possible.    SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that while he had no objection to raise to therecommendations, the whole atmosphere of the  Report was such that it might  be embarrassing for him if he acquiesced without comment.  He would, therefore, liketo be associated with the Chancellor of  the Exchequer in the remarks added to thereport by the latter.                                CONCLUSIONS.    THE COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE     (a.) Agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that approval should be given to the          Report  of Lord Salisbury&apos;s  Sub-Committee, the conclusions of which          were as follows :                &quot;1. Leaving out of account the possibility of a reduction of the          British Cavalry in India, which is outside our reference, from the point          of view of economy we are  unable on the evidence that has been laid         - before us to recommend any change in the organisation of the mounted          arm which would produce a saving.               2. We recommend that  the War Office policy (see paragraph XIII          above),  both in the conversion of Cavalry Regiments into Armoured Car          Regiments and in  the  progressive  mechanization of the machine-gun          equipment and transport of the remaining Cavalry Regiments, should be          approved.               3.  We would  draw  particular attention  to  the  desirability,  as          increased mechanization becomes possible, of making  the  fullest use  of          the traditions of the Cavalry and of the spirit and special qualities of  its          personnel in its mechanized substitute.

REPORT.            Principal Considerations affecting the Reference before us.    I.  The chief considerations affecting the reference before us may be summarisedas follows:      (a.) The minimum requirements in Cavalry of the Expeditionary Force,     (b.)  The peace time, demands of oversea garrisons, including India.     (c.)  The general tendency towards mechanization with its  resultant effects on          the strength, organisation  and cost of the Cavalry.     (d.)  The necessity for the utmost,  economy.    Our efforts have therefore been directed towards a detailed examination of these considerations with a view to answering the two main questions which are in realityinvolved in our terms of reference, viz. :      (i.)  Can the strength of the Cavalry of the Line as at present maintained be          reduced; and    (ii.) Flow can mechanization best be pursued without adding to  the existing          expense of the Cavalry.            Mobile Troops need not necessarily be Mounted on Horses.     II.  Before proceeding to describe the present allotment of Cavalry Regiments and to discuss how far they are required, one preliminary observation is necessary. Every army will in the future, as in the past, require a proportion of mobile troops, capable of rapid movement across country, for carrying out such duties as protection, reconnaissance, and inter-communication.   For centuries horsemen alone  provided this mobile element in military organisation - not many years ago cyclists furnished a proportion of the mobile troops; whilst to-day armoured cars and tracked vehicles capable of moving men across certain types of country as efficiently as. and possibly more economically and safely  than, horses have appeared.     In  considering the functions of cavalry, therefore, it is necessary to realize that they  are only  one form of &quot;mobile troops,&quot;  and that mobile troops  need not necessarily be mounted on horses.                     Strength of Mobile  Troops necessary.     III.  A Memorandum by the Adjutant-General on the allocation of the Cavalry of the Line  subsequent  to the conversion of two Regiments into Armoured Car Regiments  (see paragraph XIII below), with particular reference to Expeditionary Force requirements on mobilisation and to  drafting in peace time, is  reproduced as Appendix I.  From this it will be seen that there are to be 5 Regiments in India, 2 in Egypt,  10 in the United Kingdom, and 1 on the Rhine.  It is at present proposed that 1 Divisional Cavalry Regiment shall be provided for each of the 5- Divisions of the Expeditionary Force, which will also include  1 Cavalry  Division, consisting of 2 Brigades of 3 Regiments each, as well as the 2 Armoured Car Regiments mentioned above.     We are  agreed that in making provision for the Expeditionary Force  it is impossible to count on obtaining any Cavalry Regiments from either India or Egypt. If,  therefore, the  War  Office  calculation of Expeditionary Force requirements inmobile troops is accepted, the number of units that would be available in the United Kingdom and on  the Rhine is only just sufficient  for this purpose, and, indeed, as the Adjutant-General explains, 1 Composite Household Cavalry Regiment must be included in the Expeditionary Force instead of the eleventh  Regiment of the Line,
since the latter will be required to replace the Armoured Car, Regiment, in Egypt,which is one of the two included in the Cavalry Division.     All the witnesses examined by us were emphatically of opinion that it would be dangerous, ,to reduce, the existing mobile troops below their present strength or itsmechanised  equivalent.  It was pointed out to us that although, admittedly, duringthe long periods of stagnation on the  Western Front in  the  last war  the use of cavalry receded into the background, in the earlier and later stages of the war theutmost use was made  of the available Cavalry,  and towards the end of  the war itwas found necessary to remount Cavalry that had been dismounted.  In addition,we were warned that another European war like the last, in which static conditionsmight obtain, is not by any means the only war for  which we have to be prepared,and that in some  of the possible theatres further  afield the employment of a largeproportion of mounted troops might be  necessary (see Cabinet Conclusion 45 (27)).Lord Haig and other witnesses went so far as to say that reduction of mounted troopsbelow their  present  numbers might be even more  detrimental  than a reduction of equivalent cost in either Infantry or Artillery.     During the late  war only 1  squadron of Divisional  Cavalry per infantry division of  the Expeditionary Force was allowed.   As previously stated, however,the present  War Office proposals allow  for the provision of 1 Regiment of Cavalryper Division.  These proposals were carefully examined, and  we found the witnessesunanimous in considering  that the Divisional Cavalry in the early and late stages of the last war was too scanty.     It is, then, clear that professional military opinion is unanimous in consideringthat  we  cannot reduce our present  strength  of  &quot;mobile troops&quot;  as  defined inparagraph II above, and this is confirmed by the fact that  as compared, with the armies of other countries for which statistics are available, our proportion of mobiletroops, or at any rate  of Cavalry, is not excessive.   Appendix II contains a state-ment showing the proportion of  Cavalry to Infantry in  France,  Russia and theUnited States, as well as in the British and Indian Armies.   It  will be  noted that whilst France proposes to maintain slightly more squadrons per battalion than in1914, and Russia  a  proportion only slightly less, the proportion  of Cavalry in theBritish Expeditionary Force is only half that obtaining in 1914.  Even if these figurescannot be entirely taken at their face value, because owing to  their variety mobiletroops in different countries are not precisely comparable, yet so far as they go theyreinforce the opinion of our own military experts.     Although  the  5  British Cavalry  Regiments  in  India  are  not  a  directburden  on the British Exchequer, a reduction in  their number might result incertain economies  as regards draft finding.  We recognise that the Indian Govern-ment is responsible for the security of India and for deciding on the proportion of cavalry or other mobile troops required for this purpose.  It is,  however, a matter for the consideration of that Government whether or not, in  view of the number ofIndian Cavalry Regiments still existing, of the  Armoured  Car units  now in India,and of the  increased fire power of British Cavalry,  a reduction of the  number ofBritish Cavalry Regiments maintained  in India should be  effected.    One of themost obvious  methods  of  obtaining eventual economy, if the number  of  BritishRegiments in India  were diminished, would be to amalgamate by pairs some of theremaining single Cavalry Regiments.  As pointed out, however, in the Memorandumby the Adjutant-General (Appendix I),  such a course is not  possible if the present draft-finding requirements are to be met, and if the  11 Regular Cavalry Regimentsrequired for the Expeditionary Force are to be available on the outbreak of war.This expedient, therefore, is not open to us.                          No Opportunity for Economy.     IV.  If, then,  the strength of the mobile troops must not be reduced, we arenext brought to consider whether,  without reducing the strength of the Cavalry, any economies of organisation are possible.     The suggestion that a single Cavalry Corps for both officers  and men should be formed was examined by us.  So far  as the enlistment of  men is:&apos; concerned this system already exists, but the single Corps for all purposes appears to have nooutstanding merit and the violation of regimental  tradition involved in  it wouldseem likely to outweigh any trifling advantage to.be  derived from it.     Another suggestion  considered  was  that Yeomanry  Regiments  should  besubstituted for a proportion of the Regular Cavalry Regiments in the Expeditionary
Force.  From trie evidence obtained,&apos; however, the objections to such&apos; a course&apos; wouldappear to be formidable.  Chief among these are : -           &quot;  ,:   *    (a:) That the Yeomanry Regiments would have insufficient training for employ-          ment immediately on the outbreak of war.    (b.) That the present establishment  of  a Yeomanry Regiment is considerably          smaller than that of a Regular Cavalry Regiment.  It would, therefore,          either be necessary to  employ amalgamated Yeomanry  Regiments, to          which there are obvious  objections,  or  else  the establishment of  a          Yeomanry Regiment would have  to be largely increased, and this might          not be feasible.    ic) That no reserve exists  for Yeomanry  Regiments, that/the possibility of          forming  an adequate reserve is doubtful,  and that without reserves the          Yeomanry Regiments, either employed as Divisional Cavalry or with the          Cavalry  Division of the Expeditionary Force, would soon cease to exist.    Although the witnesses were  emphatic  that the employment  of  Yeomanry in lieu of Regular  Cavalry with the Expeditionary Force is out of the question, itwasgenerally agreed that Yeomanry Regiments  should, with further training after theoutbreak of war, provide a very valuable support to the Regular Cavalry.    V.  None of these expedients,  then, can  be recommended, and this conclusion isevidently shared by the overwhelming body of present military opinion.    VI.  So far as economy is concerned, we are, therefore, unable to recommend.any change in the organisation of the mounted arm which would produce a saving-leaving, of course, out  of account  any possible reduction in the number of BritishCavalry Regiments  maintained in India. In this connection we are glad to note that, as a result of  the recent  visit of the Secretary of  State for War to  India, theIndian Government have agreed to adopt the organisation of  Cavalry Regiments athome for the British Regiments in India, except in regard to the mechanization ofthe machine guns.  This will enable a small economy to  be effected and will simplify the home organisation, since Cavalry  Regiments proceeding from home to relievethose in India will not now find it necessary to add a third sabre squadron to their2-squadron organisation.    VII.   The   next question  facing us is: &quot;If no economy is  possible throughreduction of units, or reorganisation internally of units, can we, at any rate, avoidincreasing expenditure?  Can  we  avoid  adding  the  expense  of mechanised mobiletroops to the present expense of Cavalry V&quot;    Mechanisation has made rapid strides in recent years, and all the witnesses were agreed that in   any war mechanized  troops will  be essential, though varying in quantity and type according to the.theatre of war and the nature of the operations.They also were convinced that troops  mounted on horses will, to a greater or  lessextent, be replaceable by troops mounted in machines.  The inclusion of 2 armoured car Regiments  in the Cavalry Division of  the  Expeditionary Force is  an actualillustration of this conviction.                                              ...                     Importance of the &quot;Cavalry Spirit.&quot;    ,    VIII.  We were, however, particularly impressed by the importance, as shown by the evidence, of the maintenance of the &apos;&apos; cavalry spirit&apos;&apos; in mechanised forma-tions  designed to undertake the roles  hitherto allotted  to  Cavalry.   general sir Alexander  Godley was  emphatically of the  opinion  that  the lighter type  of armoured vehicles, such as armoured  cars and &quot; tankettes,&quot; should definitely belong to the Cavalry arm and not to the Tank Corps. Whilst strongly  against any further reduction of the Cavalry arm, he was in favour  of progressively re-equipping the cavalry with mechanised vehicles to the fullest extent possible, having regard to their development.  He pointed out that if Cavalry were abolished,  instead of beingtransformed, there would be a great danger of losing the type  of officer, non-com-missioned officer and man that has hitherto gone to the Cavalry, and that will be equally necessary in the new mechanized Cavalry; men who were, to a great  extent by birth and upbringing, and by their habits in boyhood,  natural leaders,; with aneye for  country, quickness of decision, habit of command, and all the attributes
required in connection with highly mobile forces.  These qualities, in his opinion, dohot exist.to anything like the same extent in the other arms of the service.  GeneralGodley stated that last year on Salisbury Plain he had many opportunities of seeingmechanised forces at work and that it was evident that they would be better handled by cavalry officers, non-commissioned officers and men than by personnel from other branches of the service.                 ,    IX.   And here  the evidence in one respect was most reassuring.  A particular difficulty which had been anticipated in connection with the conversion of cavalry regiments into mechanised units may be treated as eliminated,  since there is every reason to believe that Cavalry officers, and the class which provides  them,  are quite ready  to  look facts  in  the face,  and, with whatever  natural  regret, to take noexception to the change from horses to  machines.              Final Abolition of the Horse Soldier not yet in sight.    X.   Although, as explained above, opinion is unanimous as to the necessity formechanising a proportion of mounted troops, and although most remarkable progressin design has been made, the extent of eventual mechanisation cannot be ascertaineduntil  the present experimental stage has  been tried out.   Armoured cars  are undoubtedly useful and even essential  for&apos; certain types of cavalry work, but theycannot  perform  all the  functions  of Cavalry.   Again,  although some type  of&quot; tankette &quot; or small tank will, without doubt, replace the horse for many purposes in certain theatres of war, and perhaps eventually be preferred for most purposes,a design in  all respects suitable for such a vehicle has  not yet been produced.  Atany rate it seems likely that for many years the horse alone will be able to negotiatecertain  types of country in wmich we may be called upon to operate.    XI.  It seems, therefore, clear to us that anything like complete answers to thefollowing questions cannot yet be expected :      (i.) How far and  how soon can all the difficulties in mechanisation be over-          come ?; and    (ii.) Depending to a large extent, though not entirely, on the answer to the first          question, to what extent should the horse soldier survive ?    XII.  We must be  content  with conclusions on a more  tentative scale.  It is evident that, in the opinion of the War Office, the final abolition of the horse soldieris not yet, and may never be, in sight.  This was  also the opinion of the  variousmilitary witnesses we examined.    Lord Haig emphasised  the opinion that whilst  under  special conditions  the strategic role of  Cavalry could be carried out by the Royal  Air Force  and  bymechanised  forces, horsed Cavalry will still be required to provide for tactical andlc^-al reconnaissance, to protect marching troops against hostile Cavalry and againstsurprise, to  question inhabitants, and to take prisoners.    Sir David Campbell was also clearly of opinion  that the special functions ofDivisional Cavalry will still require the continued employment of horse soldiers, since no mechanised vehicle  suitable for their special functions has yet been  evolved.    It  was  also pointed  out  to  us that armies, and perhaps the  British Army inparticular,  might well have to operate in countries  which, though  open to  theoperations of horsed soldiers, would not be suitable for mechanised troops. certain types of desert in the Middle East, the muddy plains on the borders of Russia, andthe rocky hill country in Afghanistan were given as possible instances  of such types of country.   It was  further brought out that  in  certain circumstances technical difficulties still remaining to be solved may handicap mechanised troops as comparedwith horsed soldiers.   The latter can sometimes live on the country and operate for considerable periods without any line of communication, and may, therefore, be ableto operate independently at far greater distances from a military base than is possiblefor mechanised forces.  These will always be dependent on supplies of  fuel, and theproblem of  providing this, together with the necessary facilities  for repairs, as wellas for the provision and distribution of spare parts,  is one  encompassed by  many difficulties.
                                       i    XIII.   With the qualifications set out in the foregoing paragraphs-neverthelessdevelopment towards mechanisation is  certain.  We  turn  to  the  question  of  theexpenditure involved.                            :      ;. &apos; :    Our attention was called to the considerable capital cost of  the full developmentof mechanisation.  There is no doubt of the fact, but the weight of the expenditure will impose its own limitation on the speed at which any transition can be effected.    We endeavoured to obtain some idea as to the comparative maintenance cost asbetween horsed Cavalry and mechanised  troops. . Although we were given certaintentative estimates  showing  that  the difference  between  maintenance costs  wouldprobably be  negligible, it  would  appear  that  until  mechanisation has further developed the information on this point cannot be regarded as reliable.  Whilst  thecost of obtaining and transporting petrol seems likely to be less  than that of forage,the cost of wastage in machines,  as compared with wastage in horses, which will nodoubt  be  a formidable item, is  still  uncertain and is  not  ascertainable  untilexperiments on a larger scale have taken place.    From the point of view of economy, the War-Office policy of converting 2 cavalry regiments into Armoured Car units is not unduly expensive, since a proportion ofthe machines is already in existence, and is  to be transferred from the Tank Corps,whilst 2 Armoured Car units at present on the strength of the Tank Corps will cease to exist as such.  This is indeed a policy which we heartily endorse.   It not only  hasrespect to the limitations of economy, but it also complies with the necessity to whichwe have already drawn  attention of utilising to the utmost the spirit and qualities of Cavalry personnel for the operations  of mobile troops whether carried out by.horses or by mechanical vehicles.   Further, we approve  of the progressive mechanisa-tion of the machine-gun equipment  and of the transport which is being carried out.                 Effect of the Air Force on the Role of Cavalry.    XIV.  There is  one  further  matter  which  stands apart  from ordinarymechanisation and to which we devoted attention, namely, the effect that the advent of the Air Force has  had on the functions of the Cavalry.   The Air Force, in effect,constitutes a particular case of highly mobile troops, and it seems generally agreedthat it can, in suitable conditions, very largely replace Cavalry for &quot; distant strategicreconnaissance,&quot; and partially replace it in &quot;medium reconnaissance.&quot;  For &quot;closereconnaissance,&quot;  for dealing  with enemy patrols on the  ground, and for gaininginformation for which the capture  and  examination of  prisoners are necessary,Cavalry, or possibly  in the future the equivalent in mechanised troops  will always be necessary.     It might be argued that  because distant strategical reconnaissance, for whichin the past large numbers of Cavalry were employed, is no longer to be undertaken by them, the establishment of  mobile military troops in present-day armies could bereduced.  This, however, is not the case, since we have never maintained large masses of Cavalry for employment on this duty alone.   The same Cavalry units which atone stage of the operations have been employed for distant reconnaissance, at otherstages  have been employed for close  reconnaissance, protection, pursuit, &amp;c.   Theelimation of one out  of their many roles does not therefore enable any reduction tobe made in their numbers.                     Conclusions of the Committee.Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : 1. Leaving out of account the possibility of a reduction of the British Cavalry      in  India,  which is  outside  our  reference,  from the point of  view of      economy we are unable on the evidence that has been laid before us to      recommend any change in the organisation of the mounted arm which      would produce a saving.2. We recommend that the War Office policy (see paragraph XIII above) both      in the conversion of Cavalry Regiments into Armoured Car Regiments      and in the progressive mechanisation of the machine gun equipment and      transport of the remaining Cavalry Regiments should be approved.
3. We  would  draw  particular  attention  to  the desirability,  as increased      mechanisation becomes possible, of making the fullest use of the traditions      of the Cavalry and of the spirit and special qualities of its personnel in      its mechanised substitute.4. Recognising the capital cost involved in the full development of mechanisa-      tion, we recommend that the change should be made with due regard to      financial considerations.

I am content with the step thathas been taken in mechanising two Cavalry Regiments,  &amp;c, so far as this financialyear is concerned, but I consider that further measures should be taken  as rapidly as possible to furnish the British Cavalry with an  equipment suitable  to modernwar.   I hold most  strongly  that  further  transformations of  horse  soldiersare required in the interests primarily of war efficiency, but  also for the economiesresulting from the &quot;elimination of redundant units.    In these circumstances I regret that I find myself unable  to sign a report whichwould associate me either with acquiescence in the present military view, or in any suggestion  that progress towards mechanisation should not be as rapid  as  we canpossibly afford.

IllMEMORANDUM by the Adjutant-General, written on 27th October, 1927, on the situation    of  the  Cavalry  of  the Line subsequent to the conversion of two  regiments into    Armoured  Car  Regiments,  with  particular reference  to  Expeditionary  Force    requirements on  mobilization, and drafting in peace.             &apos;  20_Cavalry  612    1. After forming two  armoured car regiments by  the  conversion  of  one cavalry regiment  at  home and one  in  Egypt, the  situation of  the  remaining Cavalry of  theLine will be                           .              -                 Cavalry of the Line.

The minimum  requirements in cavalry for  the expeditionary Force are therefore 11  cavalry regiments in. all.  One of these  regiments,namely, the regiment required for one of the  last two divisions (infantry) sailing at w\plus  6  months, is provided  by a  composite regiment formed from the  two HouseholdCavalry regiments.   Although the combined peace establishment of these latter regiments,with the small reserve they produce, is not sufficient to provide for one mobilized regimentplus the 400  men required for Household duties at the commencement of  a war it can doso in time for the a; plus 6 months contingent.                                 \    Therefore, 10 regiments of the Cavalry of the Line  and one composite regiment of household Cavalry are required for the Expeditionary Force.  The eleventh Regiment ofthe Line is  needed to replace the armoured car regiment in Egypt, which is taken awayto form  part of the cavalry division in the Expeditionary  Force on mobilization.  - Thisregiment, however,  could  only be sent  abroad at peace strength, as  is shown  by  the calculations which follow later in this note.    2.

There is,however, no margin  for any shortage in peace  establishments and  possible consequentialshortage in reserves, nor has any allowance been made for  remount personnel, which hashitherto been a cavalry liability to the extent  of  about  500.  The question  of meetingremount requirements by means of the Supplementary Reserve is being investigated.     If the regiments at home are reduced to ten, the deficit in reserves would  increase toabout 950, which could not be met in full-by any means from the regular. Army until newrecruits taken in on mobilization are trained.  This would mean that the divisional cavalry regiment  due tq sail  with the infantry  division at x plus 4 months could not sail untilx  plus  5 months,   and  then  only with  a very large proportion  of post-mobilizationrecruits.     3. Thus if the Expeditionary Force requirements as now forecasted are to be met,the number of cavalry regiments at home  cannot be  reduced  below. 11 both on account ofthe number of regiments required  on mobilization as explained in paragraph  1, and  onaccount of the reservists required on mobilization.     4. From the drafting point of view, an examination of the situation shows that wecan  cover our  requirements if the  Regiments of the Line at home are reduced from11 to 10, but that there will be a  small  total shortage per-annum if a further reduction to 9 regiments  is carried out.     The reduction of any cavalry regiments at all will, however, affect training withinthe unit at home.  The size of the draft  in proportion to the establishment reacts uponthe number of the men  available  to look after horses after the drafts have  sailed and during the furlough season.Numbers required to supplement availableserving other ranks.1,659  4931,479393 Includes men required for war establish-^ ment wastage, also for Training and H.Q. units.
I     5. The Army Council have fixed for a term of years the proportion of cavalry allotted ;o the Expeditionary Force  -the  time  depending  to  some  extent on  the possibility of[producing a mechanical substitute for the horse as a means of transport suitable for all[types of country and for protective and close reconnaissance troops.   Even if we could afford a lower proportion of cavalry in the Expeditionary Force, the  abolition  of further cavalry regiments without substituting new mechanical units must inevitably lead to the loss of personnel which would be invaluable for the new type of units when they  come.     6. One aspect of this  question the effect of reduction on  the  Corps of  Officers  demands  very carefid consideration, as there is already a feeling of unrest abroad, and parents are afraid to allow their sons to take commissions in a corps of which the future is... so uncertain.     As a legacy of  recent reorganizations and reductions  in the cavalry, there are  some 60 surplus officers who cannot be absorbed before 1931-32, and any further reduction will increase the numbers to be  absorbed by 21 for each regiment reduced.     All  officers becoming redundant on further reduction will have to be &quot; axed,&quot; put onhalf  pay, or gradually absorbed.  Whichever method is adopted, the  effect  of furtherwholesale reductions will be bound to  increase this unrest and dry  up the source  fromwhich some of the most valuable  officers in the Army are drawn.     Regard must, however, be paid not only to the future, but to our immediate needswe can ill afford to lose the highly-trained serving cavalry officers, who are pre-eminentlythe type  required for command of the new type of highly mobile units which we requireand are producing as experience and money make  it possible.     Any reduction  in the number of regiments  would also result  in a smaller pool of serving and reserve officers aArailable on  mobilization, and thus aggravate the serious situation  existing with regard to the supply of officers during the early months of war.

 EXTRACT FROM  A MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR (N.E. 59),t           *            *           *            *           *            *     6.  As regards  Cavalry, the Chancellor of the  Exchequer  has suggested that an ultimate saving  of  600,000 could  be  made  by reducing 12 regiments of Cavalry to 6 regiments.     The net saving from such a reduction would in reality be  much less  owing  to  the necessity for an increase in the establishment of the remaining regiments in order to find the drafts  for units abroad.  As  the present establishment is barely sufficient for this purpose, the savings would mainly consist in reductions in higher ranks.*     In 1928, however, there would be  no saving from such coupling of regiments ; indeed,  if a  decision took  effect  as from  1st April  next, then,  even  on  favourable assumptions as to the disposal of  officers and men there would, after  allowing  for  the payment of gratuities and extra transport from abroad, be extra cost  in 1928 of  25,000.     7.  Great reductions in the Cavalry have already been made.     In  1923 one regiment of Household Cavalry and 8 regiments of Cavalry of the Line were abolished, the latter by coupling.     In  1927  I  have already made  considerable  further reductions in the  cost  of  the Cavalry by      (a) Abolishing the Cavalry Depot.     (o) Reducing Cavalry regiments at  home from  three to two sabre squadrons but I           have increased the machine guns to 12 carried in mechanical vehicles.     (a) and (b) are equivalent to a reduction of 3  regiments.    In  addition  I propose     (c)  To convert two Cavalry regiments to  Armoured Car regiments, when  money is           available for the Armoured Cars.    (d) To reduce the eight Cavalry regiments abroad  similarly to  two sabre squadrons           with 12 machine guns carried in mechanical  vehicles, 3 in  Egypt now and           5 in  India, if and when India agrees as to the 5 on her establishment.    The effective saving in a full year of (a) and (b) will be   238,000 and when (d) iscai-ried out an additional saving of  50,000. will be realized.    8.  However tempting further savings on Cavalry may be, I  am advised that we need11 regiments at home, of which 6 are earmarked for a Cavalry Division  of two Brigadesto accompany the first section of the Expeditionary Force and 5 regiments are required as Divisional Cavalry with the 5 Infantry  Divisions.  The reduction  of the Cavalry from three  to two  brigades was  agreed  to owing  to  the necessity for  having one cavalry regiment with each division.  The lack of Divisional Cavalry was severely felt during theearly and later stages of the Great War.   The draft-finding functions of the regiments athome have also to be remembered.I    9. The Chancellors proposal will leave available 6 regiments of  the line and 1 com-posite regiment of Household Cavalry, against 11 required for the Expeditionary Force on[mobilization.   He suggests  that the place of  4  regular cavalry regiments should be taken[by Yeomanry ; but Yeomanry have no time to train  and they  have no reserve to fill  upIto war strength or  to replace early casualties.  Moreover, the  Yeomanrj&apos; cannot be sentlout of  England until  a special Act of  Parliament  has been  passed, and it might  be[politically difficult or inexpedient for a  Government  to  introduce such  a measure  at thejoutset of an unpopular but necessary  war.   t Also Paper No. C.S.O. 3-.   * Apart from these considerations, the ultimate saving  would be  about  485,000 effective andp5,000 non-effective.

     The role  of cavalry, which often necessitates wide dispersal of small  detachments demands a high standard of leadership among officers and non-commissioned officers with whom the men must be accustomed to work and in whom they must have confidence.     10. I reproduce in Enclosure No.  1 a recent statement by the Chief  of  the Imperial General Staff showing why Cavalry&apos; are still necessary.  I have also obtained the views of Field-Marshal  Viscount  Allenby  and  Field-Marshal  Sir  William  Robertson,  whose statements are  included in Enclosure No. 2. -    I  believe  I shall  have gone as  far as  is prudent in remaining regiments of the line now abroad are put on the two sabre two; regiments  are converted into Armoured  Car regiments.     11. The foregoing examination of the  proposals  made by the  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer shows that instead of securing additional savings of the . 1,650,000 mentioned; in paragraph 5, the utmost that L can expect to realize from these heads of  expenditure apart from Cavalry is a reduction of say  100,000.   In the agreed figures in Appendix I,* I  have taken  already credit for the   100,000  further saving on Cavalry arising from last year&apos;s reductions, and  80,000 in respect of increased Colonial contributions.reducing Cavalry when the squadron basis and*L.

The airman can report only what he sees and bothindividuals and units and even large bodies of troops can usually avoid being seen if they takeproper precautions.  The airman can neither search, capture, identify or question, nor can be  &quot; make  good&quot; ground over which troops propose to advance.   These duties must i therefore be performed by men on the ground.     The utility of the airman for reconnaissance is also&apos;much limited by the fact that theIgreater number receive no training at all in military matters.   Military commanders cannaturally place little reliance on the reports of officers who are  not under their  control!in peace and therefore  receive little  or no instruction in the  organization and  tacticalmethods of the forces they may be detailed to observe, and who  will  have to learn the]elements of their duties during the course of the operations.     It is true that cavalry wrere not used in France during the static warfare period but,as the Official History recognizes, trench wrarfare was only another name for siege warfare]and in such conditions cavalry never have been of  airy use except perhaps in the isolated!case  of the siege of Troy.   As the enemy  was already located on the whole of the frontsfrom Switzerland to the sea, mounted  reconnaissance was no longer necessary.  In those!theatres where cavalry was extensively used,,e.g., Mesopotamia and  Palestine, I am quite]satisfied  that  it could not have been entirely replaced by armoured cars.     2.  The  question that  arises for  the  future is whether a  man on a horse is still jnecessary or whether a man, or men, in. a machine  can perform these  duties with equal jefficiency and economy.  Comparisons based on the fire-power of the armoured car or tankjare misleading;  cavalry certainly need fire support in order that they may &quot;see,&quot; but theirlraison oVetre is tq see and not to produce fire.   An  increase of fire-power is of little  use ijit reduces the ability to reconnoitre.     The power of reconnaissance depends mainly, on the  mobility of a  certain number oilindividuals and on the provision  of  sufficient fire-power  to prevent that mobility beingldestroyed by slight opposition.  The ability of the machine to replace the horse depends!on how far it can fulfil these functions and it will be advisable to consider them separately!     (a)  Mobility. In a technical sense there is  at  present  no mechanical substitute forjthe horse fit for use in the field.  An experimental cross-country armoured car is  beingfNot reproduced.
 made and &quot; tankettes &quot; have,been under trial this summer, but neither design is yet very fa advanced.  These machines are at present no more fit to replace the horse than the early motor cars were to replace the wagon.   Mechanical vehicles have ia greater radius of action than horses so long as the going is  good, but  they cannot reach ah enemy who occupies woods, buildings, or marshy ground and they  are inevitably stopped (until a substantial bridge can be built) by  streams which cavalry  can ford  in a few minutes.  A recent attempt to cross a shallow stream with &quot; tankettes &quot; put the whole of them out of action for sometime.                 .     Mechanical vehicles require a line of supply and a repair organization, whereas cavalry can live on the country for considerable periods. ^  *     (b)  Numbers. As already stated the essence of reconnaissance is the mobility of a large number of individuals possessing both eyes and weapons.   A large  reduction in the number of  these individuals or the grouping of  them in armoured vehicles cannot be altogether compensated for by an increase in either mobility or fire-power.   One pair of eyes can be only in one place at one time and six pairs of eyes in an armoured car are for many purposes no better than one pair on a horse.     (c)  Fire-power. The fire power of a regiment of cavalry is now much greater than formerly, but in  this respect  there  is, of course,  no comparison between  cavalry and armoured car units.   The  role of cavalry is,  however, to  locate organized resistance rather than to overcome it and  for this purpose its fire-power is sufficient.     (d) Summary. It is agreed that in certain countries, at any rate in certain  seasons of the year, the armoured car can attain and even exceed the mobility of a horse.  Such countries are however exceptional, as they must be dry, flat, unwooded and without rivers or streams more than one foot deep.   It is  hoped in  time to  increase this mobility still further by  the development of  tankettes or  cross-country armoured cars, but the last two limitations referred to will still remain.  While therefore armoured vehicles  are of great assistance to cavalry, it is only in special circumstances that they can totally replace them.     3. For the  present our policy should be as follows :      (a)  To build up an armoured force for the future.  It is safer, however,  to assume           that it will not be fit to take its place in  the Expeditionary  Force for at least           two years.                As  far. as can  be foreseen. this force will  be suitable for use  in certain           types of  country only.    (b)  To strengthen as far  as possible  with mechanical  means  the  existing  cavalry           formations and to prepare the ground for the eventual conversion of a propor-           tion of units  into  mechanical units.  For the present  a force of cavalry is           the  only  one that  can  be relied  on  to  perform reconnaissance  duties in           ordinary broken country such as forms, the greater proportion of the earth&apos;s           Surface.    This policy is well in advance of that of any foreign power.   All the great militarynations  propose to retain  a  considerable proportion of cavalry even in  cases where a european war is considered to be the most likely  danger to be apprehended.

Those who press for the  abolition or  the reduction  of cavalry believing that itis losing usefulness, under modern  conditions  would, presumably, replace  it by  some form or forms of mechanical fighter.    Tanks, armoured cars and the like, have by now  proved their worth, and have  beenpermanently adopted.

But, nevertheless,accidents of ground, rocky hills, ravines, sand dunes, bush and forest, impede their action and may bring them to a standstill.  - -..                 .        &apos;   s  The application of armour confers comparative invulnerability, which is increased byrapidity of movement ;  but invulnerability cannot be complete, and the more invulnerablethe machine, the blinder its crew.                        :&apos;     Endurance depends  on  petrol and  oil, soundness  of mechanism, and skill of themechanics  in charge.   :  The functions of cavalry have already been affected  by science.     Distant strategic reconnaissance  has  been taken over almost entirely  by  the  airforces.  Close tactical reconnaissance is increasingly becoming the business of mechanizedtroops.   Yet the work  of maintaining contact and linking together units  on wide battlefronts will still  fall to cavalry.   The eyes of that arm  are  not  hooded ; it has longerand wdder  vision than  the  purblind armoured vehicle ; and, in consequence, its mentalityis more alert.   Obstacles are  more easily  avoided  or  overcome by the suppleness of theequestrian  ; and the cavalier can take cover with greater facility than can the armoured car or tank.     The use of cavalry, in linking up a front in  difficult, broken country, is well shown by the work of  the  Desert Mounted Corps  (during the  second fortnight  of November,1917) on the line Bittir-Beit Ur El Tahta-Deir El Kuddis-Mulebbis-Jaffa.   &apos;  The mounted soldier of to-day is strong in fire-power, armed as  he is with rifle and machine gun and associated with a quick-firing, accurate  and  mobile horse artillery.   Hehas, besides, the assistance of mechanical carriages, which will convey extra ammunition,as may be  required.   Thus, he is able to take  his full share of a  fire  fight.   In addition,he carries  the lance  and the  pointing  sword ;  and experience  in the Great  War hasshown that cavalry, under a leader possessed of a quick  brain and sound judgment, canstill use the cold steel with as deadly effect as did the  Paladins of old.     Notable examples of successful mounted attacks in recent war are :      The   charge  of  the  4th Australian  Light Horse Brigade  at Beer Sheba on 31stOctober, 1917, in  the course of which, two trenches, deep and  wide,  full of Turks, were taken at a  gallo]:).     The   charge  of  the  Worcester  and  the  Warwick Yeomanry at  Huj,  on 8thNovember, 1917.     The charge of the 6th  Mounted Brigade of the Yeomanry Division, at El Mughar,on 13th November, 1917.     Charges by Indian cavalry  in the Jordan Valley, during the Summer of 1918.     The charge of the  Jodhpur Lancers at Haifa, on 23rd September, 1918&quot;.     The charge of the 2nd Lancers at Megiddo. on 20th  September, 1918.     At the end of-the campaign, a fine  charge  against overwhelming odds was executedby the Indian cavalry,  when Aleppo was taken.     Mechanical fighters are as has been said above under certain conditions of ground,helpless, but there is  practically no country in which cavalry cannot act.     Campaigns in South Africa, from  1879 to  recent  years, afford  many examples  of cavalry operating in localities where machines could not move.     The   high  forests, the  bushveldt,  the vleis, the kloofs, the dongas of  Zululand, Swaziland, the Transvaal,  the Orange Free State, haA^e been  repeatedly traversed bycavalry.   The rugged  peaks  of Barberlon  and the precipitous Magaliesberg have beencrossed and re-crossed.     The sand dunes of Coastal Palestine proved fatal to  tanks in the  battles round Gaza, but cavalry went through them without difficulty.  The  mountains of Judea, Moab and Gilead were climbed  and  conquered, and horsemen have made their way where even  goats find scanty foothold.     The  cavalryman is  not invulnerable, he carries no side armour, but he is a  small mark less  visible to aircraft than even the little tankette,  and  he can take shelter with the nimbleness of a beast of chase.   Even when in  masses, cavalry can be concealed.     During the preparations for the attack, timed for the early morning of 19th September, 1918, in the Palestine Campaign, three divisions of mounted  troops were hidden in the orange and olive groves north  and east of Jaffa.  The  Turkish intelligence reported on the J8th September to the effect that no essential changes had taken place in the distribu- tion of the British forces.
                  (6) Field-Marshal Sir William Robertson&apos;s Views.     Briefly my views are as follows :       (a) It is more than 50 years since cavalry attacks on unbroken infantry, armed with modern weapons, were first recognised to be an impracticable tactical operation, while never,as far as 1 know,  have cavalry been expected to attack fortified positions such as thoseencountered on the Western Front and  elsewhere in our last  war.  Neither  of thesetheories were discoveries of that war, nor were they materially affected by it.   The warmerely confirmed what had for long been known.     (6) Moreover, outside these &quot; battle &quot; activities  there are, and always have been,many other d uties for which well-trained cavalry are needed, and these duties neitherairmen nor other  mechanically-conveyed troops can efficiently perform.     (c) It  is no exaggeration to say that, but for the splendid  work of our  own small force of cavalry (5 brigades), and the want of enterprise on the part of the cavalry masses of the enemy, our retreat from Moris might have  been converted into a rout, in which casethe subsequent course of the war might have been greatly changed to our disadvantage.Further, the cavalry work done on this occasion could not have been performed nearly soeffectively,  if at all, by mechanically-conveyed troops.  The Germans made considerableuse of the latter, to no purpose.   Having personally shared in the operations, my opinionthereon may be of some little value.        $     (d) British forces may have to be employed in several conceivable  theatres of warin which cavalry  would be quite indispensable and would find ample scope for employ-ment.  Note, too, that cavalry  is not an arm that can be hastily improvised.     (e) Experience shows that it is not wise to base military organization on the con-ditions of any one war, for the simple reason that conditions in no two wars are ever thesame.  Many examples could be quoted.  I  will quote one.  After  the South AfricanWar there was a great outcry for mounted infantry.  Mounted infantry regiments wereformed.  Mounted infantry schools were established.  Much public money was expended.To-day there is not one mounted infantryman, and I  am not aware that anybody wantsone.     (/) As to comparative cost, as between cavalry and the substitution of a mechanicalarm, 1 cannot speak, but  think it is quite likely  that, for a given  sum of  money, bestresults would be obtained by at  least maintaining the cavalry we now have.     (g) To sum up, I am unable to see in the Great War, or in any inventions producedsince that time, any adequate proof that cavalry has at present ceased to be an essential part of our  military organization.   On  the&apos;contrary, reductions  in its strength havealready gone quite as  far as prudence  admits, and further reductions  would, in  my judgment, involve risks which the Government would not be justified in taking.     3rd November, 1927.o     Cavalry is silent as well  as  swift,  and  silence is often essential in war,  e.g., bightoperations as in South Africa  when moving to surprise Boer camps or concentrations.     When compared as regards endurance; with machines, cavalry has no bad record.Except in barren desert, the horse can  subsist on the produce of the country.  He can keep alive and do his work if he is given one good  drink in 24 hours.  In Palestine in1917, many horses went for 36 hours without water,  and the  loss in  horseflesh  was notabnormal  during  that  campaign.  If  he is properly  treated,  the horse will  performsurprising feats of endurance.     In France, one cause of exhaustion was the  clipping of horses, and the hard winter of 1916-17 took  heavy toll.   On active service the horse&apos;s  coat is a  necessity for hiswelfare.   With it he can defy both cold and heat.     While even tropical heat has little effect on a horse, the crew of a tank in hot weatherfind the  temperature intolerable.     &quot; The old order changeth, yielding place to newr  &quot; but evolution is a slow process.     Cavalry is not obsolete, nor, as yet, obsolescent.     The Great Masters of War have been men who understood  the - characteristics and use of each arm, and who employed all  arms in combination.    1st November, 1927.
