The time has come vhen Third destroyer flotilla are proving an embarrassment to me rather thana help.   They are occupying ? (valuable) docking spacean dockyard time and labour.   To make use of them I must ?(scatter) them over the station at coast and river ports.And personnel and relief questions ?  (are) becoming acute.I suggest therefore that they should  proceed to Malta assoon as arrangements can be made  for  them to do so.? (I will) - do rny best without them relying on your 691to ask for another flotilla In October if situationdemands it *                                  2147/13.                     s(ii)              D5CYPHER  OF TELEGRAM.From Admiralty to Commander-in-Chief, China, dated                   4.6.28.

Repeated to British MinisterPeking 583.133.   I have received Foreign Office Telegram 133 of23rd May to Peking.      x            xxx(8)   In view of attitude of His Malesty1s Government as outlined in Foreign  Office  telegram  quoted in paragraph 1of  this message there would appear  to &quot;be no  object in further detaining third  destroyer flotilla.   I  requestTheir Lordships&apos;  instruct ions  on  this point.                  (v)             DFCYPHER OF TELEGRAM.From Admiralty to Commander-in-Chief,  China, dated                 19,4.28.    No.691.     Third Destroyer Flotilla is due to recommission InAugust next.     Can you spare this Flotilla on May first when riverpermits passage of all ships under your command as far asHankow.   If you see no prospect of being able to dispense with this flotilla it will have to be relieved by anotherflotilla or relief crews  sent out by freight and presentcrews  return by freight.   First alternative will depriveMediterranean of yet another Flotilla which it is desiredto  avoid If possible, second alternative is difficult,expensive and  will entail gradual refit of flotilla at hong Kong.
     Will the following proposal  meet  your  requirements?Sail Third Flotilla for United  Kingdom on May  first  or as soon after as possible.    Another flotilla  to  ;!oinyour flag before October 15th,  if you  consider situationdemands it.
