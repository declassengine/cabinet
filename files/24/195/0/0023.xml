It has been represented  to us  that  the  tirao  hasnow come when probably in all the  countries  involved  inthe Great War the general feeling  would be in  favour  ofdiscontinuing the practice of placing wreaths  on foreignWar Memorials and official participation  in  all  suchceremonies abroad.  It would be proposed  to  make November&apos;11th,  1928, the tenth Anniversary  of the  Armistice, thelast occasion for such participation.  We agree  thatprobably the only obstacle in the way of this suggestionis a natural diffidence on everyone1s part about puttingit forward and we think that this  country should take  theinitiative now and propose through diplomatic  channelsthat a definite agreement on these lines  should  be reached between all the allied and associated countries          W.C.B.              L. W-Eo              S.  H.2nd May,  1928.
