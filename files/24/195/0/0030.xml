[This  Document is the Property  of His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.                     Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1928.SECRET.Copy No.   &apos;&amp;,\CP. 180 (28).CABINET.FRONTIER  POSTS  IN  THE  DESERT AREA  OF IRAQ SOUTH OF                          THE  EUPHRATES.              MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR AIR.    AT  their meeting on the 23rd May, 1928 (vide Cabinet 30 (28), Conclusion 7 (b)),the Cabinet directed that the  &quot; Air Ministry should  examine  the whole  question offrontier posts  with a view to determining which  are  absolutely essential  and which,if any,  could be dispensed with.&quot;  This  action has  been taken,  and  I circulateaccordingly herewith, for  my colleagues&apos; information,  a note by the  Air Staff givingthe conclusions  they have reached  after a careful  re-examination  of  the matter inconsultation with the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq.                                                                         S.  H.    Air Ministry, June 6, 1928.                            NOTE  BY THE  AIK STAFF.    1.  The area to be controlled for which  these desert posts are required extends in length parallel to the  Iraq-Nejd frontier a  distance of some  500 miles, and in depthfrom the  Euphrates varying  from 100  to  200 miles.  The  total area  involved  is approximately  60,000  square  miles.  From  the point of view of defence, bearing  inmind the reduction  of  the Military forces&quot; in Iraq, it is  desirable that there  should beeight desert  posts  extending from  the  Transjordan frontier  in the west to Koweitin the east.   These  posts should be sited as follows :  Rutbah.Muhaiwir.Ain Wiza.Lussuf.Shabicha.Salman.Busaiyah.Jarishan.    Four already exist, viz., Rutbah, Muhaiwir, Salman and Busaiyah.    2.  In order to meet Ibn Saud as far as  possible, the Air  Staff are prepared toabandon the  erection of posts  at  Jarishan and Lussuf, and to accept a total of six.Of these, Rutbah and Ain Wiza are along and immediately  south of the line of the cairo-Baghdad air route, whilst Muhaiwir is some  30  miles north of it, and all  threeare nearer the Syrian than the Nejd frontier.   They should, therefore, be of no interestto Ibn Saud.   Of the remainder, Busaiyah is the most important, and, for reasons that ave been previously explained, its retention is an absolute necessity.    The Air Staff consider that between Busaiyah and Rutbah a minimum of two  postsat Salman and Shabicha respectively can be made to suffice to enable the small forces available to carry out satisfactorily the duties required  of them in  this area.  Thus,there are only three posts regarding which Ibn Saud&apos;s objections must be. overcome,&quot;viz. : Shabicha.Salman.Busaiyah.[17761]
     3.   The Air Staff wish to emphasise that, while they are prepared to agree to this reduction in the number of desert posts from 8 lo 6, this is on the assumption that ibn saud for his part will take more effective steps than  heretofore to restrain  his tribesfrom raiding.   Further, they consider that this should be made quite clear to Ibn Saud,and  that he  should be informed that, if  there is  a recurrence of  these  raids, HisMajesty s Government must necessarily reserve to themselves the right to sanction theerection of any additional  posts that may be required to maintain the effective  defenceof Iraq and reassure the Iraq desert tribes.     Air Staff, June 4, 1.928.
