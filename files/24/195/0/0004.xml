L a U i -E .The vfar Office.   May 8th, 1923a
KEHQRATSDUIi BY THrJ CHIEFOF EES,IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFFON THE AMERICAN DRAFT TREATY FOR THE OUTLAWRY OF V7AR.1,      The discussions between the United States and French   Governments upon this Treaty culminating in the presentation of   alternative drafts by tho two Governments to the Oreat Powers   have reached a stage when it is desirable for me to give ny views   upon the significance of these proposals from the military point   of view.2.    Two entirely different conceptions have emerged from these   two drafts.   Th  French Government in theirs make a number of   reservations, of which the most significant is their right to go to   war &quot;within the framework of existing treaties.......or any other   treaty registered with the League of Nations&quot;.   The French   Government are clearly less concerned with the Covenant and Locarno   than ivith the military agreements between France and the little   Entente, Belgium and Foland, which they feel bound to safeguard.   This reservation appears to open the door very wide to the   possibility of future wars in pursuance of these agraements, the   secret military clauses of which have never been made public.  I   will, however, pass from the implications of the French draft to   the more definitely military aspect of the proposed Treaty.3.    The draft Treaty, as it stands, isould only amount to a solemn   declaration against the principle of making war.   Without under-   rating the value of abstract pledges, it is at least open to doubt   whether at times of grave international crisis this fact would of   itself be decisive.   Two things are clearly necessary to render it   effective.   V/ar must be defined;  or at any rate the sort of war   which V;Q mean to renounce must be defined.   Secondly, effective   machinery for the pacific settlement of international disputes   mentioned in Article 2 of the draft must be devised, though not
necessarily    pr.rt of this Treaty.   :sr. Kellogg issilent upon the important question as to whothor lie isprepared to accept the whole system for the practicalsafeguarding of pepce elaborated ofc Geneva or whether he proposes to establish something quite different-   Itis at any r*-te clear that his Treaty contemplates no&quot;sanctions&quot; in ense of violation by a signatory norcommon action against the transgressor by other signatories.     Tha^ iS one aspect of the Treaty, if we can get itamended, which may be of decisive importance for us aaregards Article  IS of the Covenant.   Our great difficultyin that respect, since tho United States withdrew from theLeague, has been the impossibility of onforaing a blockadeif the.United States continued to trade with the blockadedState.   The United States would probably not be unwilling to add an article to this Treaty releasing the signatoriesfrom their obligations in respect of  any one of them whobrcko the Pact ari wont  bo war.   In  that event the signatories who  are members of  the League would be  obligedto put Articlo 16 of the Covenant into force.     The United  States in such circumstances would  not, ofcourse, be an active participant in a blockade but  would aleast be und.er tho strongest moral obligation to refrain from trading with tho offending Stato.   This would removeone of the greatest difficulties -flith which the League isr-t present faced.     The issue is largely narrowed down to questions forjurists and to preoiso definitions.   17hat, after all, iswar and, particular.Vy; what is the war wo are proposing to renounce?   Is it intervention by the United Statesmarines in Nicaragua or  the bombardment of Corfu by Italiamen-of-war or a  punitive expedition upon the North west frontier of India?
         What is aggression and so.lf-*defenoe?  History rolatoe    how often the real aggressor has induced his victim to    strike the first blow, and the League of Nations has been    seeking a definition of aggression for years without succoso.    Again what exactly is moi-ut by the phrase &quot;War as an instrument.    of national policy 1*.  These are soarching qnostionu which    must be answerod by the jm\iut before it would be prudent for    us to coimai t ourselves to signing the Treaty.6.       It is,  therefore^ necessary to otat-o clearly, from a    military point of view, what &quot;legal&quot; military operations we    must retain the right to conduct -ithin the four corners of a    treaty renouncing war.  When these are stated, it will bo for    the jurist to consider to what extent thoy aro implicit in the    wording of tho draft Treaty, to what erctont the treaty requires    amendment and what special reservations, if er.y- it will be    necessary for us, with our unique position and world-vide    responsibilities, to make.  First and foremost are our    conditional undertakings in the Covenant and unconditional    ones in tho Locarno Agreement, or which we cannot divest    ourselves.  Those two are the chief commitments assumed by    British Governments since the V.&apos;ar, an. they have boen under-    taken with the object of creating alternatives to war as an    instrument of policy.  It would be wrong to assume that a    treaty for the renunciation of war was in contradiction with    them.  They cannot be stated as reservations to a plan for    preserving peace, for they are an essential part of it.         There are also all wars or operations undertaken in self-    defence or in the safeguarding of the frontiers of our    possessions or mandatod territories.  In this case it must be    borne in mind that such operations though defanaive in intention    may well reach far beyond the mere geographical frontier line.    Furthermore, we must, safeguard our right to suppress rebellions    or to protect national interests in such circumstances as    occurred recently at Shanghai.         The right to conduct certain military operations of a                              -3-
defensive oiiaraoter or in accordance with Treaties intendedto safeguard peace have been set down, not becuaso thoy aroinconsistent with a general treaty for the renunciation ofwar&apos;j  but in order that they may be taken into consideration before the final drafting is settled.  All such operations.are strictly in accordance with the spirit of such a treatyjit remains only that they should accord with the letter.  if that is ensured the Treaty may be welcome as likely tocontribute to the elimination of aggressive wars and to thefuture peace of the World.
