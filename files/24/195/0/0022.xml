Memorandum by the  President  of the Board of Trade.               It  will  be  remembered that  in 1925  a Committee was          appointed  under  the safeguarding of  Industries Procedure to          enquire  into  an  application  for  a duty on enamelled hollow-          ware .  The Report of the Committee was circulated with my          memorandum CP.  148 (26) of  7th  April, 1926.               The Committee were  unable to find that  in the oase of          wrought  enamelled hollow-ware, to which class of goods the          application was  confined,  the quantities imported were abnormal,          and they did  not regard  the  evidence given as to   employment          as satisfactory,  further, they  expressed some doubt as to          the efficiency of the Trade  as  a whole.   The  Applicants&apos;          claim,  therefore, was not established.               A further application was received from the industry,          and at  the beginning of  March of this  year I  re-appointed the          Committee  to  consider, having regard to their previous          Report,  whether  the present  position in the industry was such          as to justify the imposition of  a duty.    I now circulate          the further Report which they have submitted.Jra. 28.        A recommendation   is made that  a duty of 25 per cent.          ad valorem be imposed upon &quot;all imported wrought enamelled          hollow-ware (whether of  iron or  steel) for domestic use,          except children1s toys&quot;.fiaCRET:.!,P. 172 (28)
td2paras.9-10.     Although in 1926 they were unable to support the           Applicants&apos;  claim, the Committee are satisfied that a new           situation has arisen and that the quantities of wrought           enamelled hollow-ware imported indicate an increasing           tendency, whereas both the Home production and the exportsparas.13-15 . of Home produce have decreased.  A considerable reduction           Is shown in the number of persons employed in - this industry,           and the Oommittee are also of the opinion from evidence of           actual loss of employment and of short time in the factories           that omployment is being seriously affected.Para.12.       . The Oommittee re-affirm their previous finding that the           prices received by the foreign manufacturer are below those aras. 18-25. of profitable manufacture in this country.  Remuneration in           competing countries on the Continent although tending to           increase is still materially below that obtaining in this ara.26.    country.  The Oommittee are now satisfied that  tho industry is           being conducted with reasonable efficiency and economy.                I think the finding of the Committee should be accepted           and I recommend that the Cabinet should approve the inclusion           of a duty of 25 per cent, on wrought enamelled  hollow-ware           for a period of five years in this year&apos;s Finance Bill.  The           duty should oome into force as soon as possible after the           necessary ways and Means Resolution has been introduced.  I           also propose to publish the Report of the Oommittee in           accordance with the established practice, just before the           introduction of the Resolution.

SAFEGUARDING   OF   INDUSTRIES.SECOND REPORT OF THE COMMITTEEonENAMELLED HOLLOW&quot;-WARE.
-19 7     -t- ^ *  ISSixth   MARGH,   1928.     The Board of Trade are hereby pleased to re-appoint the Committee appointed by them on the 2nd November, 1925,to inquire into and report upon an application from theEnamelled Hollow-ware Section of the Wrought Hollow-wareTrade Employers&apos; Association for the imposition of a dutyon Enamelled Hollow-ware - namely                Mr. P.II. Davenport,  (Chairman)                Professor A.W. Kirkaldy, M.A., B.Litt., and                Mr. I,J. Haywardto consider, having regard to their Report dated the 31stMarch, 1926, whether the present position in the industryis or is not such as in their opinion to justify theimposition of any (and if BO what) duty on the said articles.     The Board are further pleased to appoint Mr. W.J.Galleyto be Secretary to the Committee.                      (Signed) P. Cunliffe-Lister.
                 SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.  SECOND REPORT OF T/E COMMITTEE ON ENAMELLED HOLLOW-WARE.To the Right Honourable    Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P.,          President of the Board of Trade.S ir,1.   On the 6th March, 1928, we were re-appointed as aCommittee under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure toconsider whether, having regard to our Report dated 31stMarch, 1926, (Cmd. 2634) the present position in the EnamelledHollow-ware Industry is, or is not, such as would justify theImposition of any (and If so what) duty on Enamelled Hollow-ware .2.  . The Enquiry opened on 30th March., 1928, and five public meetings have been held, in addition to which certainevidence was given to us by both parties in camera.  evidence was tendered by twelve witnesses, five being called by the applicants (The Enamelled hollow-ware Section of the WroughtHollow-ware Trade Employers&apos; Association) and seven by a group of merchants, importers and wholesalers who constitutedthe Opposition.  One of our number, Professor Kirkaldy, hasalso been able to visit several works including some notconnected with the Applicants&apos; Association.3.   Mr. C .F&quot;. Entwistle, instructed by Messrs.Smith and Liyce,Birmingham, appeared for the Applicants and Mr.N.L.Macaskieand Mr. J.3.Herbert, Instructed by Messrs. Stlkeman and company, appeared on behalf of the Opponents.4.   As at the previous Enquiry the application was confined to wrought enamelled lib 1 low-ware. .
5,   According to Information submitted by the Applicants a tour earlier enquiry, the total number of firms engaged at theend. of 1925 in the manufacture of wrought enamelled hollow-ware was 18, the estimates of total production being based onthe returns of a few firms who, it was claimed, representedapproximately 55 per cent, of the whole trade.   The resultsof the Census of Production for 1924, only available to ussince the date of our last Report, however, shew that theproportion of the trade In the hands of these few firms wassmaller than they had assumed, and that there were also somefirms, whose.names were not known to the Applicants, who were making small quantities of wrought enamelled hollow-ware.The total quantities of such goods manufactured by these latter firms in the Census year,  represented, however, lessthan 4 per cent, of the total production In this country, andwe do not consider that the absence of information on theproduction of wrought enamelled hollow-ware by those firms in subsequent years appreciably affects the position.  Since thedate of our last Report, 6 of the 18 manufacturers have eitherclosed down or ceased to carry on this trade while one smallfirm has added this class of goods to its other manufactures.This leaves a total of 13 firms, known to the Association, asengaged in the production of wrought enamelled hollow-ware.On this occasion the bulk of the figures submitted both Inregard to Home production and employment have, at our request,been independently certified to us.  Those which have notbeen so treated we regard as somewhat under-estimated by the applicants and have made allowance therefor In our conclusions.   On this occasion our enquiry has been concentrated on
those  &quot;instructions&quot; in the  &quot;iVhite Paper&quot; regarding which inour earlier Report we were not satisfied.   These were those relating to Importation and Employment, while on the BritishIndustry1s efficiency and the Continental labour conditions we also called for further evidence.7.   Taking the &quot;&quot;&quot;White Paper&apos;&quot; questions serially we beg toreport as follows:-(1) Whether the applicant industry is by reason of the volume     of employment engaged In the production of the goods     to which the application relates or by reason of the     nature of the goods produced an industry of substantial     importance.8.   tie formed the opinion at our previous enquiry that theVvrought Enamelled Hollow-ware Industry in this country mightbe regarded as one of substantial Importance and we adhere to that view to-day.(2) ffhether foreign goods of the class or description to     which the application relates are being imported into     and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in     abnormal quantities.9.   In 1926 we experienced some difficulty in arriving ata suitable basis for comparison tinder this Section of theshite Paper, but for the several reasons then given we were unable to support the Applicants&apos; claim.  The position,however, as regards importation has changed,  and indicatesan increasing tendency,  especially when viewed with regardto the Trade as a whole, and the -almost  negligible re-export business.  The following figures, which also  appear inAppendix A to this Report, suport this,view;-
Imports of Wrought Enamellod Hollow-ware.Impor t s.RetainedImgor^TsVTons.Tons.3,6437,6768,5925,7475,8217,8857,2859,7543,4687,6348,5085,6165,7627,8217,1959,690      (a) A duty of 33/3 per cent, ad val. in           force against German imports only from           23/8/22 to 20/8/24,      (b) General Strike and Goal Stoppage year.10.   It will be noted that the average importation for. 1.921and 1922, the two years considered at our last enquiry as most fair and normal for comparative purposes are 8,134 tons,while that for 1926 and 1927,. the two new years under review.the figure rises to 8,519 tons.  Corresponding figures for imports retained here are 8,071 tons, the average for 1921,and 1922, and 8,442 tons, that for 1926 and 1927.  Both theHome production and the exports of Home produce shew adownward tendency in recent years.11.     After very careful consideration of the evidence and documents submitted to us, we are of opinion that the replyto this question is in the affirmatives(3) Whether the^foreign goods so imported are being jrold     or offered for sale in the United Elngcicrri at prices     whi ch ar 6 be lew the przl csg^ at^ yvhlch similar goods can.     be profitably manufactured or produced in the United     Kingdom,.12.  The Applicants considered that&quot; c-n this question the192019211922192 31924192519261927(a)(a)(a)
....... ;, . ......      .  .   _____-.......... .... .... ^____________.................,(   .. ......nCommittee&apos;s previous Report was favourable to them.  this contention was not challenged by the Opposition nor was any evidence submitted to indicate any alteration in the positionas regards the prices of imported goods as compared with thoseof the Home products.  We therefore remain of the opinion thatthe prices received by the foreign manufacturer are in thevast majority of cases below those at which similar goodscan be profitably produced in this country.(4) Whether, by. reason of the severity and extent of such     competition, employment in the manufacture or production     of such goods in the United Kingdom is being, or is     likely to be, seriously affected.13.    We have received fuller and more reliable evidence onthis occasion from both Employers&apos; and Trade Union representa-tives.  It was shown that in September 1925, approximately3,900 persons were employed by makers of wrought enamelledhollow-ware known to the Applicants.   After making full allowance for the numbers employed by the small minority of firms in respect of whom certified returns &quot;/ere not sub-mitted, it would appear that the average number of persons engaged in this Trade during 1926 was 3,360 while the average for 1927 falls to 2,980 persons.   14. As this Industry is not separately distinguished in theMinistry of Labour returns, we have not been able to rely onany official information as to the numbers unemployed or on short time. Trade Union figures were, however, submitted tous in evidence which indicated a continued decline over anumber of years.  In the case of one Trade Union, coveringskilled workers only, 19,081 days unemployment benefit(exclusive of any benefits disbursed under the UnemploymentInsurance Acts), were paid in 1927 as compared with 11,121 days
1 J 9X % Obenefit paid in 1922.   This Trade Union was concerned with.workers in the galvanizing Trade.as well as those In theenamelling Trade hut it was stated in evidence that approximately two thirds of the &quot;benefits were paid to workers of the latter trade.15. In addition to the decline in the number engaged In theindustry, and the increase In the number of workers eitherunemployed or drafted as opportunity arises into other trades,a considerable.amount of &quot;short time&quot; is also evident among those workers who are still in the industry.16. Our response to this question is, therefore, also in the affirmative.(5) Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from     countries where the conditionsi are so different from     those in this country as to render the competition unfair.17. We received no evidence that (a) depreciation In currency,or (b) subsidies exist sufficiently to render the presentcompetition unfair,18. The minimum wages payable In the wrought enamelled hollow-ware industry in this country are governed by the &quot;GeneralMinimum Time Rates and Overtime Rates for Male and FemaleWorkers, and a Piece-Work Basis Time-Rate for Female workers of 18 years of age or over&quot; issued by the Ministry of Labourunder the Trade Boards Acts, 1909 and 1918, (Notice H (14)dated 22nd December 1922) while, in respect of the skilled maleworkers, among whom are included sheet metal workers, fusers,picklers and others, a minimum time-rate has been the subjectof an agreement between employers and the Trade Unions.19. The following statement Indicates the minimum rates perhour payable for the various classes of labour:-
Male workers.     Female Worker s.(18 years of &quot;age and&apos; over)SkilledUnskilledTime-ratePiece Work Basis  Time-Rate.1/6 less 5%   ll^d6fdTfcTIn the case of male workers, the piece work basis time rate is usually in the neighbourhood of 25% above the time rate for thecorresponding class of worker.20. In Belgium according to the official Brussels Wage Sheetfor November 1927, the rates paid to skilled male workers Inthis Trade varied from 3.50 francs to 4.00 francs per hour (orfrom 4.8d to 5.5d per hour), while unskilled male workersreceived 3.00 frs. (or 4.Id) per hour, and women workers 2.00francs (or 2-fd)  per hour.21. So far as Germany is concerned, according to the variouswage tariffs in force in the Metal Working Industry (withinwhich comes the Enamelled Hollow-ware Industry) the time ratosfor skilled and semi-skilled workers vary from 61 pf. to 81 pf.(or 8d. to 9-fd.) per hour, and that for unskilled labour from60 pf. to 66 pf. per hour (or 7-Jd. to 8d.).   To these ratescertain small increases granted in December, 1927, and inApril of this year amounting together to approximately 5 percent should be added.   It would appear from this, and evidence given to us that the minimum time rate paid to skilled maleworkers corresponds to lOd. to l/- per hour, while the ratepaid to unskilled labour corresponds with approximately 9- d.per hour.   In the case of one Important German Works we were informed that the &quot;weekly earnings&quot; of skilled men,  includingcertain family allowances and increased rates in respect ofany hours worked In excess of 48 hours per week ranged from-a-
57 Marks.to 67 Marks per week of 52 hours.  This Is equivalentto from 1,11 Marks to 1.29 Marks (or l/l^d. to l/3-fra) per hour.22. The wages of skilled female labour may be as high as 75%&apos;of the rate for the corresponding male worker, but in general would appear to average 50 pf, (or 6d) per hour.23. It transpired from the evidence that the rates of wages in Czecho-Slovakia for this Trade were slightly lower thanthose obtaining In Germany.24. The hours of labour in Germany, the only country inrespect of which evidence on this question was submitted are,normally,restricted to 48 hrs. per week, and are thereforenominally little in excess of those current in the industry inthis country.   In many Instances, however, overtime is regu-larly worked and although paid for at increased rates is looked upon as part of the normal hours of labour.25. We find therefore that while those continental countriesreferred to, now incline to shorter hours of work per weekand increasing remuneration, the latter is still materiallybelow the remuneration obtaining in this country while thereal hours worked are longer than those ruling here.(6) Whether the applicant lndustr^j^s^being carried on in the     United Kingdom, with reasonably             and economy.26. Due to further evidence and the knowledge gained fromProfessor KIrkaldy&apos;s visits to seven of the English works weare satisfied that the Industry is being conducted with reasonable efficiency and economy.    Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class.     or description in question would jsxert^ a^ seriously     Adverse effect on employment in any otfaer^indusjbr^;     being an Industry using goods -of that class or     description In production.
      &apos;27. fte confirm our earlier view that a duty would not esrert       an adverse effect on employment In other industries.       (s) ^]SS^S^^^S^ ^J S&amp; ^^^^^^, P^97e conditions, the            applicant industry has,, in the ^opinion of ^ tire Committee^,            established a claim to a dutyA and if so,i what rate or            rates of duty, in the pjoinlpn of the Committee, would            be reasonably sufficient tocountervail the unfair            competition.       28. After a careful review of the evidence from both, parties       and consideration of tns industry s position as a whole, we       desire to recommend that a duty of 25 per cento ad valorem       be imposed on all imported wrought enamelled hollow-ware       (whether of Iron or steel) for domestic use, except children5       toys, and that such a duty should prevail for at least five       years from the date of its adoption.   while this duty is not       so great as that asked for by the Applicants we believe it       will suffice to countervail unfair conditions of competition.       29, We again desire to record appreciation of Mr. Galley&apos;s       services as Secretary which, have been most helpful to us.                           We have the honour to be,                                     Sir,                                Your obedient Servants,                            (Signed) P.R.
