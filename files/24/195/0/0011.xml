                II POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.    The position in this  industry continued to remain bad  during  the  quarter.At  the end  of  March the number  of  persons in the  industry registered  asunemployed was  200,032,  compared with 207,196 at the end of December 1927.The decrease of  7,000 during the three months is accounted for by a fall of 13,000in the temporary stoppages category, against which there was a rise of  6,000 inthe numbers wholly unemployed.IRON, STEEL AND TIN PLATE.    Very little change was shown in employment  in  the  iron and steel tradesduring the quarter.   In the pig iron  trade, slight improvement was  shown  inemployment during the last two months of the quarter.  The position in tin platemanufacture, after  being bad  during the first two  months, showed  considerable improvement in the last month of the quarter.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.    The employment  position in the  shipbuilding industry worsened  slightlyduring the quarter mainly owing to the completion of work and the shortage of replacement  orders.   Employment in  the  ship-repairing  industry  comparedfavourably with la,st year.ENGINEERING.    There  is  little  change to record in  engineering during the  quarter, andemployment  remained steady in all  branches.  During the last month  of the quarter activity in  the  motor branch  was  more pronounced.   Constructionalengineering showed a slight decline during the first two months.TEXTILES.    Cotton. A considerable amount of short-time working is still prevalent  inthe American  Spinning Section  of  this industry,  and very little  improvementwas  shown during the. quarter.   Employment in the Egyptian fine  spinningsection continued good.    Woollen and Worsted. There was an all-round improvement in this branchof the textile industry during the quarter, and the amount  of short-time workingdeclined.    Other  Textiles. In  other  branches   of the  textile  industry employmentremained fairly steady, with a tendency to improvement on the whole.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.    The bad weather at the beginning of the quarter caused considerable stoppage of operations, and unemployment increased  during January.   A slight improve-ment was shown during February, and with the approach of better weather inMarch  unemployment was considerably reduced.  The position in  this industry,however, was worse than at the end  of March of last year.   In  brick and tilemanufacture, after a d.ecline in employment in January, a slight improvement was shown  during the remainder of the quarter.
CLOTHING TRADES.    After the usual seasonal increase in unemployment during January,  a  bigimprovement was shown during the succeeding two months, and the position atthe end of the quarter was rather better than at the same date last year.POTTERY.    During the  quarter  fairly good  recovery was made  from the  seasonaldepression which existed after the Christmas rush of orders was over.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.    Employment  at  the  docks during the quarter was  slack.   Some  slightimprovement was  shown  in shipping services during the  last month of the quarter.
     III. WORK  INSTITUTED  FOR  RELIEF OF  UNEMPLOYMENT.                               Numbers Employed.          [See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]     The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistancefrom the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.     Scope  of  Table. The  schemes  included  are  those   undertaken  by   local and  other Authorities  and  Public  Companies   with  a   financial  contribution from  the  State   with  the  object  of   relieving  unemployment;   and   works in  respect of  which  guarantees  have been given  under the  Trade FacilitiesActs  as   capital  undertakings  calculated  to  promote   employment  in  thiscountry.   Schemes  to which  State  financial assistance   is  given,  but  whichare  not undertaken  primarily  for the  relief  of unemployment  (e.g., HousingSchemes),  and works put  in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance  arenot  included.   Certain other schemes  involving  Government assistance are alsoexcluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men whoare directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export credits scheme and contracts  for equipment,  clothing, &amp;c,  accelerated by GovernmentContracting Departments.     Method of Compilation. The figures  for the  Road   and  Bridge Schemesassisted by  the  Ministry   of  Transport   and  for  schemes   assisted  by  theUnemployment  Grants   Committee  are  (with the  exception  of   certain  road schemes in, respect of  which  returns are  received  direct  by  the  Ministry  ofTransport) obtained  from  returns  received  at   Employment   Exchanges   from local  and  other   Authorities   and   Public  Companies.    Those   relating  to schemes assisted under the  Trade  Facilities  Acts are  compiled  by  the  TradeFacilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to  whomguarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				Mar. 31,1928.

The figures take no account of the employmentprovided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.    f These figures indicate men employed on the work itself.  They include part only of the men employedon the  manufacture  of the materials used.  They take no account of the labour involved in  winning.transporting,  &amp;c, raw materials.    Note. No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part  of the  normal programme.  The average number of forest employeesengaged on the Commissions operations (including Crown woods) during the  quarter ended March 31,1928was 3,359 as compared with 3,013 for the corresponding quarter of 1927.
                                                         (Dominions Office.)    Under the  Empire  Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to  make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s OverseaDominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities.  This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the government measures designed to deal with unemployment,  and.should not be so regarded.    For many years before and after the war, the natural increase of  population  exceeded, the net migration  movement by about  300,000 ayear, but recently the gap between the natural  increase  and the net migration movement has tended to diminish.   During 1926, the natural increase in: England, Scotland and Wales was  279,775, and the net migration movement was 103,969.  Consequently, the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 175,806.    The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the months of January, February and March,  1928(with the corresponding figures for the year 1927), and for; the twelve  months ended the 31st March, 1928 and 1927, respectively, are set outin the following Table:           I   &apos;;    Quarterly-Progress Return relating tjo Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;  .           ,....

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are  so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated  figure  of ExchequerAssistance.  Foiuthis reason,  the accompanying  Summary is only indicative of theextent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to,  and not  in substitution  of,  the detailed  information given in  the  Tableathemselves.Summary.

The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided insurance against unemploymentin certain selected industries.   It was followed by the Act  of 1916, which increased the  numbers of  persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act  of general  scope  which applied  compulsory insurance  against  unemployment  to 12,000,000  persons.Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of  receipt of benefit, increased-contributions, provided  benefit in  respect  of  dependants, and  authorised theTreasury to  make  advances out  of the  Consolidated Fund  up  to a  limit of. 30,000,000.        ............     By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, the rates  of benefit are revised asfrom the 19th April, 1928, as follows :  17s,.(instead of 18s.) a week for men, 15s. aweek for women, with 7s. (instead of 5s.) a week for an  adult dependant and 2s. aweek for each young dependent  child.  As from the 5th July, 1928, reduced  rates will  operate for  persons under 21  years of  age.   Benefit may be paid for threemonths to a claimant who has paid 30 contributions  in  the two years preceding the  date of his claim,  and may continue throughout  each  subsequent period ofthree months at the beginning of which this  condition is still satisfied.  During a transitional  period, which  in individual cases  may extend to  two years, benefitmay be paid  to a claimant who  does not satisfy the  above condition, if he has paid 8 contributions in the two  preceding years or 30 contributions at any timeand  fulfils certain other conditions.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to March 31, 1928.Expenditure                                                             Benefit paid      ....       ....       ....  329,358,000        -Appropriation for Administration  ....   33,113,000         Section  9 Unemployment Insurance          Act (No. 2), 1924, and Section 25-          Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920    2,938,000         Miscellaneous              Refunds, &amp;c.....       ....       ....    1,890,000         Interest (Net)    ...       ....       ....    1,312,000                                               --  368,611,000Income-    Contributions          Employers       ....       ....       ....  125,295,000         Employed        ....       ....       ....  112,483,000         Exchequer       ....       ....       ....   85,956,000         Exchequer (for ex-Service Men)     ....    4,090,000Balance of Old  Fund at Armistice  (excluding    Interest accrued) *          Employers       ....       ....       .....    5,825,000         Employed        ....       ....       ....    5,825,000         Exchequer       ....     .....       ....    3,884,000327,824,00015,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....       ....       .....                24,530,000Miscellaneous                                     ...

In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-inent  (Facilities)  Act, 1919, and other  Land Settlement  Schemes for  the benefitprimarily of ex-Service  men, are carried out  (a) through the agency  of CountyCouncils and Councils  of County Boroughs  and  (b)  through  the Ministry  ofAgriculture and Fisheries.    Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes upto the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement  Scheme  came  to  an end, isestimated to be  15,250,000, of  which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loanedby the Public Works Loan Board.   Interest in respect of  such loans is  payable byCouncils.   Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act,  1919,  theExchequer bore the loss incurred up to the 31st March,  1926, on the Councils&apos; SmallHoldings account (e.g., due to charging a fair  as opposed to an  economic rent), sofar as such loss had been  reasonably and necessarily incurred.    As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer assistance takes the form of annualcontributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from  the  Councils&apos;  estates.   These contributions which did  not  commenceuntil the year 1927, will vary from year to year, and  their total capitalized valuecannot at present be estimated.    In Scotland  land settlement is not conducted  through the agency  of CountyCouncils.    Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since  1916  a  number  of  properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon  and the difference, if any,  betweenthe annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders is being borne by the Exchequer.  Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciablecash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is  met from  thesurplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.

After the-Armistice, Juvenile  Unemployment Centres were  opened in certainlocalities  to deal with the problem of  unemployed juveniles.   After a period of closure centres were again established, and the cost, which was originally shared bythe Board of Education and Local Authorities, was, from the 1st April, 1923, to the31st March, 1924, partly met out of Relief of Unemployment Vote by grants up to75  per cent, in  respect  of approved schemes,  the Local  Authority providing theremaining 25 per cent.  From the 1st April, 1924,  the Exchequer Grant was, as anemergency measure, for so  long as unemployment amongst juveniles remains acute,raised to  100 per cent, of the approved out-of-pocket expenses of Local EducationAuthorities.    From the 1st April,  1926, the Exchequer Grant was revised as follows : (1.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles exceeded 6 per  cent, during the twelve months which ended on the        23rd  November, 1925.    A per capita grant  fixed by  the Minister for  each  Authority separately equalto the approved average  weekly cost to. the Authority of each Juvenile in averageattendance, taking into  account recurrent expenditure only, during the twelvemonths which ended on  the  30th June,  30th  September,  or  31st December, 1925,whichever was the latest  period for  which consecutive claims had been received.  Ifcomplete figures for one  year ending on one of the above dates were not available,or if the Authority had not previously opened Centres,  the per capita grant was fixedhy  the Minister on such  information,  including  the  Authority&apos;s proposals  for1926, as was available to  him.(2.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles was not less than 3 per cent, and not more than 6 per cent, during        the twelve months which ended on the 23rd November, 1925.    Either (i) a per  capita  grant  calculated  as in (1)  above, but equal  to three-quarters only  of the approved average weekly cost, or (ii) a grant of 75  per cent.of the approved out-of-pocket expenditure incurred  by the  Authority during thefinancial year 1926, as the Authority chose.                           -kJCHEMES FOR TRAINING WOMEN AND JUVENILES AND YOUNG UNEMPLOYED FlT MEN.                          (Estimates, Class V, Vote 9.)                                 (A.)-WOMEN.    The following table aggregates : (i)  the  expenditure incurred  wholly by theMinistry of Labour in connection with the Registered Unemployed Women&apos;s Schemewhich operated from 1919 to 1921;  (ii)  the expenditure on schemes for  trainingwomen in Domestic Service,  &amp;c, under the auspices of the Central  Committee forWomen&apos;s Training.  Up to  the 31st July,  1924, the cost of this scheme  was metpartly from Exchequer Grants and  party  from other sources,  but,  as from the1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne  by the  Exchequer.  additional provision has  been made  in the vote for 1928 for training  women and  girls indistressed mining areas with a  view to their migration to  other Districts.
 (3.) To Authorities in whose areas the average rate of unemployment among insured        juveniles was less than  3 per cent, during the year which ended on  the        23rd November, 1925.    Normally no grant is payable, but if in the case of a County Council  the Authority  can  show  that  there  are clearly  defined districts where the  average percentage of insured juveniles unemployed during the year was definitely abnormal, the Minister is prepared in approved cases to sanction grant as in (2) above in respect of expenditure on Centres serving these districts.    In the case of approved Centres established by Authorities who are Authorities for elementary education only, grant is paid under  (1) or (2) above, according to  the percentage of unemployment  among  insured juveniles in the area of the Authority for elementary  education only, provided that the  proposal of  the  Authority  has received the concurrence of the County Authority concerned.    From  the 1st April, 1927, the Exchequer grant is payable under terms similarto those  in  force  for the  financial  year  1926, with  the  exception  that,  to qualify  for grant  under paragraph  1, the average rate of unemployment amonginsured  juveniles in the area of  an Authority must have  exceeded 7 per cent, forthe calendar year 1926.  Further, per  capita grants  were revised  so  that  themaximum  rate of grant is  5s. for boys and  4s. 6d. for girls per week of 15 hoursinstruction.    Pending consideration  by the  National  Advisory  Councils  for   JuvenileEmployment of the recommendations of the Malcolm and Salvesen Committees,it  has been  decided  that  during the financial year 1928  each Local EducationAuthority should receive grant at the rate at which grant  has  been paid to  them during 1927, irrespective of the percentage of insured juveniles unemployed in their area.    It was decided in December 1927 that the provision of Centres in mining&quot;  areas should be  largely  extended, and in these cases payment of 100 per cent, approvedout-of-pocket expenditure has been sanctioned to the 30th September, 1928.Estimated Net Expenditure from Armistice to March 31,1928.			1928 Estimates.			&quot;Estimated Net Total Expenditure from Armistice to March 31, 1929.

The Ministry of Labour is conducting a scheme of training for employment inthis country and for work on the land overseas for the benefit of unemployed menwho, owing to the prolonged trade depression, have had no opportunity of learninga skilled trade.   Four urban and two  rural centres have been established.   Thelength of a course of training varies from 10 to 26 weeks.Estimated Expenditure to March 31. 1928.	Provision for 1928.
