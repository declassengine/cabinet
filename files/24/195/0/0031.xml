llote concerning Powers and Authority delegated.to Admiral Tyrwh.it t, Commander -in-Chief, China.       Admiral Tyrwhitt  telegraphed on 25th Hay  seeking a ruling as  regards his powers.    He alluded  to  the  Standing  Instructions from H.M, Government  contained in Admiralty telegrams Mo.812  - 815,  to Foreign  Office  telegram  to  Peking,  No.568 of  5th Octetor, 1927,  and to  Admiralty telegram No,510 and  from these he evidently  inferred that he had authority  to move troops from  Shanghai and to  replace  them from Hong Kong.   This  authority, he stated,  has al?rays &quot;been, and is still being  questioned by the Generel Officers Commanding in China.       Adm5.ralty replied to Admiral Tyrwhitt (Telegram Mo.788  of  29th May,  1923),  informing him that Admiralty telegrams  543 and 812  - 315 set  forth the  authority and powers  confided to  him  by H.M.  Government and that  Foreign Office  Telegram 568 must not  be construed as  extending these  powers. .       The  position now  is, therefore,  that Commander -  in-Chief,  China, remains the Principal Military Adviser  of  H.M.  Government  on broad questions of  policy connected  with  the  safety  of British  lives in China and that  he may  take  retalfato^r or  Immediate punitive action in the event  of  fire  being directed   on  his  ships  or  outrages  occurring  which endanger the lives of British nationals or  when  there is  actual  wanton destruction of  British property,,       For  such retaliatory or punitive  action onl^r  is  Commander-in-Chief, China, authorised to  draw  on the  Shanghai  Defence Force for  any  troops  he  may require  and  which the  Genera], Officer Commanding is  able  to  spare.Copy  attachedo              -1-
     Any military operations undertaien must be strictly limited in character and  of  such  a nature  thatthey do not necessarily involve Naval  or Military under-taking s on&quot; an extended scale.     Prom the above it will be seer, that K.M.Government only authorise Admiral  Tyrwhitt to take  actionconseoiient on some offensive action or outrage by theChinese.   He is not empowered to  take military  measuresanticipating such hostile action of a  precautionary orpreventative character.     In the &quot;Standing Instructions for the Guidanceof the Commander-in-Chief, China&quot;  Issued by the  admiralty the following paragraph appears       &quot;Neither you nor any officer in command of one        of His Majesty &apos;s ships under your  or*ders  is to        undertake any hostile&apos; operations without Their        Lordships 1 express authority, except in  a case       , where British life and property are at stake        and require immediate naval interference.&quot;                               CHARLES E.

Cypher telegram to Sir 11. Lamp3on, (Peking),     Foreign Office,  October 5th 198*?, 10.00 p.m.No. 568.     commander-in-Ohief1s telegram to Admiralty.No. 1499.     We are opposed to formal repudiation ofHankow Agreement (see my telegrs-m No. 561) and toresumption of control of the concession unless this latter course is forced upon us.  In view therefor of Commander-in-Ohief&apos;s opinion that until lowwater at any rate any crisis can be best met bydespatch of war ship, as it would be inadvisable toland troops unless we intended to retake the concession, and of General DuncanTs opinion that notless than a battalion should be sent in case ofemergoncy (which could not be accommodated on board ship for any length of time), we think it would bebetter entirely to discard for the present any ideaof despatching military units to Hankow.  Shouldemergency arise, involving danger to life, theCommander-in-Chief already has full authority under his standing instructions to take such measures ashe may deem advisable.  This might include, ifnecessary and practicable, the detachment from the shanghai Defence Force of such troops as theOommander-in-chief may require to supplement  hisavailable foroe of marines if he considors that thisis Inadequate to meet an emergency, arising whether before or during low water season, but theso troops would be accommodated on board, ship and would beemployed In all respects as marines.     Repeat to commands-in-Chief and GeneralDuncan.
