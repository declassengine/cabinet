0.?. 156(28)          In Cabinet 64(27) the following decisions weremade:-   .  (i)  The programme for 1928/29 should provide for          2 cruisers (as coinparsd with 3 in the white          paper).    (ii)  The question of whether these cruisers should          be Glass- fA&apos; or Glass S&apos;E? should be reserved          for the present in order that all factors &quot;bearing          on the situation might &quot;be weighed &quot;before the          cruisers are laid down0          In order that these ships may be laid down duringthe present financial year, it is necessary that the pre-liminary design work should be commenced at an early date andtherefore that the Cabinet should now decide as to the actualtype,  Glass fA*  or Glass ?Bf, to be built.          In the 1927/28 programme 1 &apos;At and 1 ,B* classcruiser were dropped from the number adopted in the &quot;Programmeof New Construction&quot;, Command 2476.  Prom the 1928/29 pro-gramme a further cruiser has  been omitted.          In spite of this, no change in the actualauthorised programmes of other Powers has been made.  telegrams from our Ambassador at Washington have, however,  indicated that the bill for authorising the construction of 15 10,000ton Glass &apos;A&apos;  cruisers in the United States is certain to be passed.

-2-As pointed out in theMemorandum &quot;by t&apos;LeFirstLord, CP, 325(27),&apos; if the American programme is to 1)3carried out, then all the cruisers we &quot;build in 1928 and 1929should &quot;be of the same class,  It is true that the originalAmerican programme of 25 has been reduced to. the number of155 but these 15 are all to be Glass *A!, and pur cruisersto be. built should therefore be, similar.country 23 &apos;A! Class cruisers in 1934, whilst assuming a building programme by us of 2 &apos;Af Class cruisers this year,3 in 1929 and 3 in 1930, our number of &apos;A5  class cruisersin 1934 will be only 21,  To this should be added 2 &apos;B* Classcruisers now building making equality to America in numbersof 8&quot; gun cruisers but actual inferiority in gun power.          It is recommended therefore that the cruisers ofthis year&apos;s construction should be the SAJ  type.  This willrestore the position in &apos;A&apos; class cruisers contemplated-in Command&apos; Paper 2476 and temporarily modified for politicalpurposes by the dropping of the  fA! Class cruiser in 1927/28.-furthermore:, the American programme gives that          The Admiralty request, the anCabinet to proceed accordingly.thority o(Intd)   17. 0.
