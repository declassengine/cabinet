[This  Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.Printed for .the Committee of Imperial Defence.  May 1928.SECRET.Copy  No.  &amp;8COMMITTEE  OE IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 235th Meeting, held on May 22, 1928*        (5.) ADEN PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH  THE IMAM.      (Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 234th Meeting, Minute 9.)  - - ;     THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the question of the instructions which should be  sent to the  Resident at Aden in regard to negotiations -with  the Imam.     MR. AMERY reminded  the Committee of the circumstances which had led up to the despatch of the telegram quoted in the Minutes of the 234th * Meeting of  the Committee of Imperial Defence (Minutes of 234th Meeting, Minute  9).  It would be  recalled  that  in  that telegram the Resident at Aden had  been  authorised to commence immediate negotiations for a preliminary  Treaty, and that he had been instructed not to  be too insistent in regard to the area to be evacuated immediately. The Imam had originally asked that the negotiations should be postponed until  the 1st June, and he  had now sent a letter to the Officer Commanding Taiz asking  for a further postponement until  the 17th July.  &quot;Although this letter contained no specific  promise,  it implied willingness to evacuate.   There were two other points raised in the Imam&apos;s letter.  The first was a request for a more precise definition of what we  were prepared  to do in the way of supplying him with arms and munitions, and the  second  was a tentative suggestion  that he  should  be given compensation for buildings, &amp;c, that he had erected in the area which he was to evacuate.   The Acting  Resident had suggested  that he should be  authorised to postpone negotiations until the 25th June, and had asked for instructions as to what reply should be given on the other points raised in the Imam&apos;s letter.   Mr. Amery thought that as regards the first, and main, request, we should grant a  postponement until the 17th July, on the express  condition that the Imam  should immediately evacuate Daala as an earnest of his good faith.  As regards the second point, namely, the question of war  material, he suggested that we should let British firms supply him in the same way as we allowed them to supply Ibn Saud.  As regards the third point, namely,  compensation for buildings, he thought  that  we should  give a tempoESLrizing reply.    SIR HUGH  TRENCHARD said that air reconnaissances  showed that theywere still building dug-outs at Daala.  He was very anxious  that we should  act.quickly, before the effect of the. recent air action had  worn off;  and he agreed thatthe  postponement  of  negotiations until the 17th July should be conditional on theimmediate evacuation of Daala.    SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that this  was the first he had- heard ofthis condition.  He asked what  action the Chief of the Air Staff proposed  that  we should take if the  Imam refused to evacuate Daala.    SIR HUGH TRENCHARD replied that the first  step would be a demonstrationby 6 or 12 machines,  which would drop warnings;  and that, if that failed to havethe desired effect,  the next step should be a continuation of bombing operations.    SIR AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN  said  that  he  was prepared to  agree toMr. Amery&apos;s suggestions, as he was not quite sure whether the Imam meant business[17706B]
or not.  There were two other points to which he wished to refer.  First, there hadbeen a proposal that Kamaran should be used as a base of air operations. He wishedit to be clearly understood that this was out of the question, owing to the internationalcomplications that would arise.    SIR HUGH TRENCHARD intervened to reply that the local authorities hadalready been warned  that the employment of Kamaran as an air base was ruled out owing to the Dutch Concessions in the island.    SIR  AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN,  continuing, said  that,  in  regard to thequestion of the supply of arms, he thought that it would be premature to attemptany more precise definition at the moment, or to say more  than  that  we  would beprepared to render assistance &quot;within the limits of our international obligations.&quot;    MR.  AMERY thought that the Resident at Aden  might be instructed to fellthe Imam that, if and  when he came to an agreement with us, we would not put an embargo  on his supplies of war material.  There  was, of course, no question of supplying him at the present time.    SIR  AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN  suggested that  the  Foreign Office and colonial  Office, in consultation,  might be  instructed to  draft a formula which was more explicit than the phraseology which had been used  in the previous instructions for the consideration of the Cabinet.                                            1  ,                               CONCLUSIONS.    The COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed to recommend to the Cabinet-    (a.)  That the Imam&apos;s request for a postponement of the negotiations  until the           17th July should be granted, on the condition of his immediate evacua-           tion of Daala as an earnest of his good faith.    (&amp;.)  That the  Foreign Office and Colonial Office, in consultation,  should draft,           for ^ the consideration  of the Cabinet, a more precise explanation of what           we&apos; were prepared  to do in  the matter  of the  supply of war  material           within the  limits of our international obligations.    (c.)  That, as regards the Imam&apos;s request for compensation for buildings, &amp;c,           in the areas that he was to evacuate, a temporizing reply should be given.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       May 22, 1928.
