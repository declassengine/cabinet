Rating and Valuation (Apportionment)  Bill.                  Memorandum by the  Minister  of  Health.      1.    She Rating and Valuation  ( Apportionment)  Bill  is  the first  of  the  legislative measures necessary  to  give effect  to  the scheme of rating reform.     2.    The Bill defines the olasses of hereditament which are to be speoially distinguished in future  valuation lists, with a view to the grant of relief from  rates, namely:-  (a) agricultural hereditaments,  (b) Industrial hereditaments,  (o)  freight  transport hereditaments.    It provides for  the apportionment  of the net annual value  of hereditaments falling within these  olasses  in cases  where  the hereditament is used partly  for agricultural, industrial or freight transport purposes  and  partly for other purposes.   It further provides for the entries to  be made  in future valuation lists for giving effeot to this classification  and apportionment and (in the first schedule) for the necessary modification  of present lists.     3.    5?he Bill is thus a machinery Bill.    It does not, in Itself, confer relief from rates in respect  of any classes of hereditaments,  though for convenience  such phrases as  &quot;excluding from relief&quot;  are used in this Memorandum, but it  paves the way for the introdtictlon of such a measure next  Session.     4.    The following notes deal  first  with certain questions arising out of the definitions of the various classes of hereditament  which are to  be subsequently given the  advantage of rate relief,  and secondly  with the  administrative machinery of the Bill.&quot;     5.    Agricultural Hereditaments           The definitions  of agricultural hereditaments are
taken in the main from existing legislation.   The definition of agricultural land is adapted from the definition in theAgricultural Hates Act,  the agricultural buildings defIriitlon,Xa.taken from the Second Schedule of the Rating and ValidationAct, 1925.  Woodlands are included as agricultural hereditamentswhich will subsequently be entitled to relief;  and .slightmodifications of the Agricultural Hates Act definition havebeen introduced for the purpose of removing doubts inconnexion with cottage gardens.          Clause 5 requires that the proportion of the valueattributable to sporting rights and advertising rights whichenhance the value of the land shall be separately stated,the intention being that this proportion should not get thebenefit of derating.     6.   Industrial Hereditaments and Freight Transport          Hereditaments.          The general principle which it has been sought to observe in framing these definitions (Clauses 4 and 6) andthe respective provisions as to apportionment of the net annual value of such hereditaments (Clauses 5 and 7) isthat the undertakers, whether industrial or transport, shouldbe relieved of rates in respect of their premises in so far as these are used specifically for industrial or transportpurposes respectively.   On this basis premises which are used for the same kind of purpose, whether they form part ofan industrial or transport hereditament or of a hereditamentoccupied for distributive trade or form a separate and independent unit should, if possible, be treated in the same way as regards the grant or withholding of rate relief.So far as it cau be avoided a manufactiirer should not get
relief in respect of any part of his premises (e.g.the garage in which he houses his fleet of motor lorries)which he uses for purposes which bring him intocompetition with persons engaged in other forms ofbusiness (e.g. road transport contractors) who arenot qualified for rate relief.  It is also desirable toavoid any inducement; whioh otherwise might be occasioned,to modify ordinary trade arrangements in order to securethe&apos; benefit 6f rate relief.          It was the recognition of these principles which led to the tentative definitions in the cabinet memorandum which excluded from relief such premisesas offices and show-rooms.  The theory was that suchan element as on office wherever occurring, whether aspart of a factory or of a concern engaged in distributivebusiness or otherwise, should always be rated.          But in the application of this principle Ithas been necessary to consider (a) the practicability,from the administrative standpoint, of carrying toextremes the distinotion, according to their precise user,of parts of premises which are valued as one hereditament,and (b) the extent to which unfair competition with persons not qualified for rate relief may be occasioned by failure to disoriminats where  distinction is feasible.          Ehe Bill has been drafted upon a oarefulconsideration of the weight that should be given tothe two considerations above mentioned.     7 *   In3nstr iel Hereditaaents.          !Ehe definition in the first plaoe excludeshereditaments primarily occupied and used for the following
lespurposes or any combination of those purposes.     (a)  A dwelling-house.   This excludes the case where a house is used primarily as a dwelling-house(but industrial operations are carried on in the house.  There would be no rating relief forexample for the dressmaker who uses a room in her house for Tier .........tr ad e,     (b)  A retail shop.   This would exclude the ordinary shopand small premises occupied e,g. by the jobbing tailor or thecobbler where repairs are exeouted for  Individual customers andwould also exclude the wayside garage.     (o) Distributive wholesale business.   This will rule out the distributive trades.   As an example may be mentioned the wholesale                     (house which imports tea, blends it and  packs it for distribution.     (d) Storage.  This will exclude the warehousing business.     (e) Public supply undertakings.   This means undertakingssupplying gas, water, electricity or hydraulic  power for public purposes. It will tRua-exclude from relief such a station asthat at Lots Ho ad which supplies power  primarily to railwaycompanies but not (e,g, a station established by a group ofcolliery companies primarily for supplying current to theirseveral mines,          Words are added generally precluding  the deratingof hereditaments primarily used for purposes other than miningor the carrying on of a manufacturing process or handicraft.This will ensure that buildings which are not primarily usedfor industrial purposes but do not fall within  any of the categories (a) to (e) shall not be entitled to  exemption inrespect of any part just because they happen to contain some small part which is technically a &quot;factory&quot; or  &quot;workshop,&quot;                             4.
          Subject to these  exclusions the general  plan of the definition is to cover the  case  of mines and  then  to adopt asthe basis the definition of factory or workshop  which is oontainedin the Factory and Workshop Acts.    This has  the advantage ofproviding as a criterion a classification which  is well known,  andwhich it is thought is generally well adapted for  the present purpose.   It is, however,  thought proper to  exclude from reliefthe garage within a factory, on the ground that  if it were includedclaims to derating would arise from garage contractors which wouldbe dlffioult to resist.    It should, be noted  that  one effect of the definition would be to leave fully rated the  newspaper office wherethe printing work as well as the work of editing,  management etc.is carried on in one hereditament.          It is further provided that any other  place within theprecincts which would notrbe classed as a factory or workshopunder the Factory Acts shall not for the purposes of the valuation                     I list be distinguished from the rest of the factory except in sofar as the value of such places exceeds 10 per cent, of the valueof that part of the hereditament which would  come  under theFactory Acts.          The broad effect of this definition is to makeeligible for rate relief -     (a)  the productive part of the undertaking,  including parts          within the precincts used for storage  and for such          operations as sorting, packing, grading etc.     (b)  such ancillary parts within the precincts as a siding,          a canal basin or a wharf;     (c)  such parts as welfare rooms, where  these are controlled          by the Factory Acts;     (d)  such parts as sale rooms, show rooms,  offices and          recreation premises, so far as these are not controlled          by the Factory Acts, up to 10 per cent,  of the value          of the factory or workshop part of  the hereditament.
          It is understood that normally the parts included underheading (d) will fall below the 10 per cent, limit.          It is to be noted that the definition oorp-era^heT^ditsmenteused for repair work suoh as ship repair work, wagon repair workand such factories as engage in the repair of motor oars.   as already mentioned the ordinary wayside garage would be excludedfrom rate relief.   The definition also includes laundries, drycleaning works, and bottle washing factories.   It is perhapsdoubtful whether the latter should fall within the category of productive trades but it is probably a very email class.  Mentionshould be made of the inclusion of electric stations other thanthose which are excluded under the head of public supplyundertakings.  Installations in a factory for making electricityfor use in connection with the work of that faotory will baclassed for derating.  Sidings and docks are included.   Aprivate railway outside the precincts of a faotory, for example                 (-one connecting a Colliery with the coast, would not be derated.                   -  freight Transport Hereditaments,          The Bill has been drafted so as to bring within theecdpe of the scheme -     (i) Freight-carrying Railways;    ( ii) Canals and Inland Waterways;  and   (iii) Harbours, Docks and piers (other than purely                               pleasure Piers).     (i) As regards Railways, the decision as announced in theBudget speech excludes the purely passenger-carrying lines.  a definition has accordingly been drafted which has this effect.  Bya convenient reference to the Railways Act, 19SI, the MetropolitanDistrict Railway, which has freight receipts of under  10,000, isalso excluded.  This railway is excluded from the scheme of regulation of fares and charges Imposed by the Railways Act.   Itwould create an anomalous position if, because of the negligible
quantity of freight traffic on this particular Electric iteiiiray..,.in the Underground Group, the area of relief and of regulationhas to he extended.          In addition to the main line railways and theMetropolitan Railway, the definition would admit to the schemeabout 15 lines owned or worked jointly by such companies,  andalso about 29 Light and Miscellaneous Railways not included in either of the foregoing groups.  These Light and MiscellaneousRailways in 1925 earned freight receipts of  137,620 and paid in rates  8,622,  Of this latter sum nearly half was contributed bythe Swansea Improvements and Tramways Company.  The inclusion ofthese Light Railways presents no serious difficulty of definition.The effect is negligible in so far as the relief of industryis oonceraed, hut some anomalies might result if charges on certain of these small undertakings were not adjusted In sympathyvrith those on other railways and their inclusion maintains the distinction between the freight-carrying undertakings and thenon-freight carrying undertakings.          Apart from statutory railway undertakings to which reference has &quot;been made above, there are a certain number ofprivate railways mainly used in connexion with oollierles andquarries.  As stated earlier in this Memorandum the Bill as drafteddoes not bring these railways within the scope of the proposedrelief,(ii)  Canals and Inland Waterways.          Ho particular difficulty arises in defining these undertakings for the purposes of the scheme under the classificatic&quot;freight canal hereditament&quot;.  In addition to the industrial canalsinland navigations would be covered by the definition.(iii)  Harbours, Docks and Piers.          The definition of a&quot;dock hereditament&quot; is intendedto exclude pleasure piers.  Y/harves, jetties and other premisesoccupied by  statutory dook or harbour authorities are covered by
the definition.  So also are similar premises which are  usedfor public traffic hut are operated by wharfingers who arenot statutory undertakers.  Suoh wharfingers are often in competition with statutory undertakers and it does not seemdefensible to exclude them from relief although it must  benoted that there is no control over their charges and it wouldbe necessary to trust to the foroes of competition to seourefor their customers the advantage of the rate relief accorded to them.  Purely private wharves etc. used for Importing the raw materials or exporting the finished products of aparticular industrial undertaking by which they are owned wouldnot be covered by the definition but If within the preoincts ofa factory would form part of the Industrial hereditament andtherefore be relieved.  There will be private wharves outsidethe precincts of factories which will not get relief.          There are some difficulties in limiting the extent              (of rate relief in the case of the transport hereditaments in away similar to that adopted in the case of industrialhereditaments.  The case of dwelling houses, hotels, and publicrefreshment places is fairly olear and it is proposed that theyshould not be eligible for exemption.          warehouses are more difficult for while there  is acase for relieving warehouses or other storage spaoe used forthe handling of goods in transit, there is objeotion torelieving a warehouse which ia used for other than temporarystorage and in fact is in competition with the warehouseman whohas a warehouse which is not attaohed to any railway, wharf orharbour.  The Bill as drawn excludes from the exemptionclassification a part of a transport hereditament which  provideswarehouse accommodation for merchandise not in the course of transit.
          As regards offioes it Is proposed that those whichare physically separate from the transport undertaking - forexample the Port of London Authority offices which are situateat some distance from the docks - should not be derated.  Thegeneral offices at a railway terminus will be classed with therest of the station for rate relief.  Receiving and bookingoffices situated away from  the railway will be derated.9*  Machinery.          The administrative maohinery of the Bill is breifly as follows          Valuation Lists are e considered,  in two categories -      (a)  those which will  come  into force after  Jjyfc  Ckrtob^rs-. 19 &amp;.      (b)  those whioh will  be  in force on that  day.          The former will,  by  the operation  of  the permanentprovisions  of the Bill, be  made  in a prescribed form  which will carry out the requirements  of  clause 1 that  certain classes  ofhereditaments shall be  distinguished in the  list  and  the net annual value thereof shown  as  apportioned where apportionmentis necessary.          The latter will,  by  virtue of the  temporary provisions  in the  Second  Schedule, be adapted to  conform withthe permanent requirements  applicable to  future lists by theprocess of  making  a special list of the various classes  ofhereditament concerned.   As,  under the general scheme,  the deficit in  rate Income  (as  estimated at 1st  October,  1929) whichwill  be caused by  the  exemption  or relief of  certain  propertieswill  be an  important factor in the determination  of theExchequer Grant, it is  essential that a representative of theTreasury should be concerned in  the compilation of the speciallists  which, as from the  1st October, will replace thecorresponding parts of  Valuation Lists now current or in courseof preparation.   The Schedule accordingly provides for the co-operation of Revenue Officers with the Rating Authorities in                             9.
  this work arid gives  them rights  of  objection  to  the Assessment  Committees and of appeal to Quarter Sessions.            Details as to the particulars  to be  entered,  the  time-table to be observed  in  the compilation  of  the special  list etc., are left  to be  prescribed by  regulations Which; by  virtue of the applied provisions of the  Rating and Valuation  Act; 1925* are to be made  after  consultation  with the  Local  Authorities and must be laid  before Parliament.            Under the  provisions of the  Bill requiring Revenue  Officers to be associated with the  Rating Authorities  in the  work of apportionment it will be necessary  for the Inland  Revenue Valuation Office to engage additional temporary staff.  It Is estimated that the additional oost which will be  incurred by the Valuation Office will  amount at a maximum  to  150,000.  (Of this sum it Is anticipated  that seme  80,000  will be expended in  the financial  year  ending 31st March,  1929,  and the balance in the following financial.year.  The Bill  provides in Clause 9 that the expenses of the Inland Revenue  shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by  Parliament and a  Financial Resolution will be  necessary,May, 1928,
