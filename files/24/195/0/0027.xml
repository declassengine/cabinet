HONG KONG:  COAST  DEFENCES.                          (C.I.D. Paper No. 319-C.)    THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff(C.I.D. Paper No. 319-C) in which it was recommended that the conversion of theexisting gun mountings of the coast defences at Hong Kong should be approved.    SIR AUSTEN  CHAMBERLAIN said he had nothing further to add to theviews of the Foreign  Office expressed  in the  correspondence  attached to thememorandum.                                CONCLUSION.    THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed:     (a.) That, in their opinion, the arguments advanced in the report by the Chiefs          of Staff  (C.I.D.  Paper  No.  319-C)  would  sufficiently  justify the          conversion of  the coast defence gun mountings at Hong Kong;  and    (6.) To  recommend  to  the Cabinet  that the proposal  to  convert the gun          mountings with a view to increasing their elevation should be approved          in principle.         ******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,       May 22, 1928.
[This  Document is  the  Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]       Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  May 1928.SECRET.                                                       Copy No.    63319-C.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 150.)                 COMMITTEE  OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.HONG  KONG  COAST DEFENCES.  (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 294-C.)                  Report by  the Chiefs of Staff  Sub-Committee.     1.  IN the course of recent  studies regarding the defences of Hong Kong, we formed the opinion that it was desirable to convert the existing mountings of the fixed armament at that fortress so as to secure an increase of range, and we approached the Foreign  Office for their views  as to the legality  of  such conversion under existing Treaty obligations.  We mentioned,  at the same time, that a cognate  question had recently arisen in regard to an increase in the elevation of the guns  carried in certain ships of the United States Navy to which  it was understood that no objections were being raised by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     2.  The fixed armament  at  Hong  Kong at  the present  time consists  of the following :                8 9&apos;2-inch guns.              11 6-inch guns.               4 r4&apos;7-inch guns.     The conversion of 9&apos;2-inch and  6-inch mountings only is  in  question.   In the case of the 9&quot;2-inch mountings the main  alterations would consist in heightening the existing  top  carriage  and  providing a  different  power  supply,  the  alterations to the concrete emplacements being comparatively small.  In the case of the 6-inch guns, conversion of the elevation from  15Q to 45c would involve the provision of a completely new mounting.  Since  the latter would be of. a  new design, the  War Office are not at present  in  a position to say exactly  what alterations  to the emplacements would be necessary, but, in all probability, these alterations would be considerable.     3.  In reply to our letter,  we were informed by the Foreign Office that Sir Austen Chamberlain did  not consider that the   question of  gun  elevation in  capital ships retained  under the Washington  Treaty  for the  Limitation  of  Naval Armaments was  really  relevant  to  the  consideration of this  matter in view of the difference in the wording between Chapter II,  Part  3, Section  1  (d),  and Article  XIX  of the above Treaty.   The former forbids &quot; any  reconstruction &quot; of capital^ships except for certain purposes  duly  specified,  while the  latter lays down that no  measures shall be taken &quot; to increase the coast  defences &quot; of the territory in question.     It was explained to us that as regards gun elevation in retained  capital ships HisMajesty&apos;s Government  still adhered  to the view that structural  alterations necessary,for increasing  the elevation of  turret  guns were contrary  to  the  Treaty,  but that no steps had recently  been taken to  press this view  upon  the  United States  Government.In adopting this attitude His  Majesty&apos;s Government  have been, we were; informed,      [17657]                  &apos;                                         B
                                         ylargely influenced by a trustworthy report that the elevation  of  the turret guns  in japanese capital ships has been increased, without  any reference  to the signatoryPowers.     Finally, we were informed (see Enclosure No. 1) that in the opinion of the ForeignOffice there was little doubt that the proposed conversion of the coast defence guns at hong Kong would  be contrary to the provisions of Article XIX. of the washington treaty, and  that unless the above view could  be shown to be incorrect, Sir austen chamberlain would  be reluctant to agree to these alterations without  previous consul-tation  with the Governments  of the United States and Japan.     4.   We were unable to accept this ruling  without further explanation, as, in ouropinion, it appeared to be based on an incorrect appreciation of the implications of chapter II,  Part 3, Section 1 (d), and of  Chapter I, Article XIX, of  the  washington treaty, and we therefore addressed a further letter on the subject to the Foreign Office(Enclosure No.  2).  In  this  letter&quot;  we pointed out that Article XIX  of the  Treatyexpressly allows &quot; such repair and replacement of  worn-out weapons and equipmentsas is customary in naval and  military establishments in  time of peace,&quot; and that this qualification  plainly allowed for the modernization  of existing  or replaced equipment,since, it  could not  be  intended that  the States concerned  should maintain stocks  ofobsolete guns, mountings or ammunition,  to replace by identical weapons those whichare worn out.  It further seemed illogical to maintain that an increase of range, whichcould be obtained by using an improved  projectile, was prohibited if obtained by  animprovement to the mounting.     We further stressed our opinion that the  true interpretation of &quot; an increase ofcoast defences &quot; appeared to  imply, so far as guns  were concerned, the installation ofmore numerous guns or the  substitution  of guns of larger calibre  for existing onesof  smaller calibre.   Another  point  which  we  considered of  importance  in  thisconnection was that the object of Article  XIX  of the Washington Treaty, namely, themaintenance of the status quo as regards  fortifications and  naval bases, could  not  be read as relating to the bases considered independently, but must have some relation tothe navies which were the main subject of the  Treaty and against or in aid of whichthe bases  were  designed,   The result of allowing an increase in the elevation and range of the  guns in Japanese and American warships would be to upset the status quoif the coast defence guns were left in  their present condition.   Incidentally, we drew attention to the fact that the  cost of altering the elevation  of  the turret guns in theUnited  States battleships &quot; Nevada &quot;  and  &quot; Oklahama &quot; which  is now probably being undertaken would amount to an average  of  ^3,500 per turret, an indication of thelarge structural alterations involved.     5.   In reply, we were informed  (see Enclosure No. 3) that in  the light  of the argument  outlined  above,  and  in view of the  gun elevation which is  understood  tohave been  carried out in certain capital ships of the  United States and Japanese navies,the Foreign Office would not raise objection to  the proposed gun alterations  at HongKong,  provided that the Chiefs  of  Staff, as   the  expert advisers of  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in such matters, were prepared to  defend, should  the necessity arise, thethesis that these  alterations did not involve an increase in  the coast defences of theColony within the meaning  of Article XIX of the Treaty.  It was  also suggested thatwe should consider the bearing  of  our arguments given  in paragraph  4 above  on german disarmament,  and  particularly  on  the future coast  fortifications  of thatcountry.     6.   With  regard to the latter  point, we would  draw  attention to the attachedextracts  from Article XIX of  the Washington Treaty and Articles 180 and 196 of theTreaty of Versailles (Enclosure No. 4).   Although there  is a certain similarity between these respective Articles, there is  no sentence in the  Treaty of Versailles corresponding to the  last sentence in Article XIX of the Washington Treaty.  We have been informedthat the replacement of worn out guns in the German  coastal  defences was providedfor in a. certain &quot; Table B,&quot; which was forwarded by  the Commission of Control in 1922to the  German Government and accepted  by them.   This Table laid down the exactnumbers and calibres of the guns  which Germany was permitted to construct eachyear, but  made  no restrictions as  to the modernisation of such  guns.   We do not,therefore,  consider that there would be any objection to the Germans  replacing a wornout equipment by a modern equipment which, for the same calibre, would permit of agreater  range being obtained.  We further understand  that there has never been anyquestion of limiting by any means the ranges of the guns of German naval vessels.
s:   Jt therefore  appears to  us that tlic  question-  of  the Eastern, fortifications -inGermany mentioned 1 in ihe Foreign Office letter (Enclosure  Xo. 3) lias no&apos;real bearing on the case of Hong Kong.   Guns and  their ranges do not enter into the german problem, which  was concerned only with  the question of fortifications;   This was divided into two parts-.                     ,  :-,.v.\                          . :,:!Jji^    (a) the replacement of existing earthworks  by more  enduring  constructions of           concrete; and                                                     --A,.;-&apos;^    (b) the construction of entirely new concrete AVORKS  which the Germans argued do           not modify the existing system of fortifications.    We are informed  that an agreement was  ultimately reached between the allied military Committee of  Versailles  and the  German  representatives, by whicL it  wasdecided that the existing works could not be increased in either number or dimension,but perishable materials, such as earth, wood and bricks, could be replaced, by concrete ;and further that a certain number of new constructions could be retained, the remainderbeing destroyed.                                                          &apos; .,,    7.  With  regard to the proviso in paragraph 2 of the Foreign  Office letter: of the24th April (Enclosure  No. 3), we presume  it to be  the intention that we should beprepared to furnish the necessary material and arguments ifco the authorities responsiblefor defending our action in converting the coast defence mountings at Hong  Kong inthe  event  of objection  being raised  in any quarter.  We consider that the argumentsgiven in paragraphs 4 and 6 above  would fully justify  conversion of-the mountings,and we suggest that the Committee  of Imperial Defence should approve them in orderthat they may  be  placed on record for future use, if necessary.                 ;    ,;    8.  In conclusion, we request that the proposals  to  convert the gun mountings at hong  Kong be approved, in order that they may be given effect as soon as the necessary funds are available, since, in our opinion, the  coast  defences of Hong Kong, in theirpresent condition, would be totally inadequate in the  event  of war.              ,                                      (Signed)       H.

Committee of Imperial Defence,(No. I.D./H/2.)                                      2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,Sir,                                                        April 4, 1 928.    I AM directed  to inform you that the Chiefs of Staff at their 67th Meeting on the2nd instant considered your letter No. A. 1503/590/45  of the  15th March, 1928, which stated that in  the opinion of the Foreign Office the conversion of the existing mountingsof the fixed armament at Hong Kong would appear to be contrary to the provisions ofArticle XIX of the Washington Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament.    2.  The Chiefs of Staff venture to suggest that this ruling ignores the importantqualifying sentence  of Article XIX, which expressly allows  &quot; such repair and replace-ment  of worn-out  weapons  and equipment as  is customary in naval and militaryestablishments in time of peace.&quot;    3.  This  qualification, in their opinion, plainly allows  for the  modernisation ofexisting or replaced  equipment,  since it cannot be intended  that the States concerned should maintain  stocks  of obsolete guns,  mountings,  or ammunition, to replace byidentical weapons those which are worn out.    It could  hardly seriously  be  contended that the use  of  improved patterns ofprojectiles or propellants which give a greater range with the same gun is prohibitedby the Treaty. It would, therefore, seem  illogical  to maintain that an increase of rangewhich can be  obtained by using  an improved  projectile is prohibited if obtained byan improvement to the mounting.    4.  The Chiefs  of Staff  would also draw attention to the fact that no attempt wasmade in any part of  the Washington Treaty  to limit the  power of guns otherwise thanby calibre, presumably because any other method  was  seen to be impracticable.  Theyconsider,  therefore,  that the true interpretation  of &quot; an increase of coast  defences &quot;seems to imply, as far as guns are concerned, the installation  of more numerous guns orthe substitution of guns of larger calibre for  existing  ones  of smaller  calibre.   the mere  modernization of existing  armament  within the limits of  its  present numbers and calibre of weapons cannot, it is suggested, be  within the Terms of what the Treatyset out to prohibit.    5.  The Chiefs  of Staff  Sub-Committee further venture to suggest that the view expressed in  your  letter referred  to  above ignores the object of Article XIX of theWashington Treaty, which was the maintenance of the  status quo as regards fortifications-tions  and naval  bases.   This status  quo cannot be read  as  relating  to  the basesconsidered independently, but  must  have  some relation to the navies  which  werethe main subject of the Treaty and against or in aid of which the bases were designed.     6.   Since no objection is being taken to the increase in  the elevation and range ofthe guns in Japanese and American warships, to leave the coast defence guns as theyare would in itself upset the status quo in so far as the  relative strengths of the ships and forts are concerned.     7.   In this connection, the  Sub-Committee, would point out that the regulations in  the Washington  Treaty  against  increasing  the armament of ships  (Chapter II, Part  3, Section I (d)) &quot;are,  in  fact, considerably more stringent than those dealing with the armament of coast defences (Chapter I, Article  XIX).  The former specifically lay down that no alterations  in  side  armour, in  calibre, in  number or general type of mounting of the main armament are to  be  permitted, yet if  gun elevation is increased in capital ships the  turret armour has to be modified, and  the lower  part of the gun mounting reconstructed.     8.   The  Admiralty have estimated that the cost  of altering the  elevation  of the turret guns in the United States battleships &quot;Nevada&quot; and &quot; Oaklahama,&quot; which  is probably now being  undertaken,  would cost   94,000 in  each ship, an average of  i?3,5u0 per  turret.  This  gives an indication  of the  large structural alterations to turret armour, cVc, involved.     9.   The  Chiefs of  Staff Committee feel  strongly that if the present ruling of the Foreign Office is upheld, and if  an increase  in the range of ships&apos; guns is  permitted, the virtual effect of  the Washington Treaty will be not  to leave  the  coast defences in
-the Pacific in the same state vis-d-vis ships as they, were at the time of the Treaty, buteventually to render them entirely innocuous.    [0.   I am  therefore directed  to request that the matter  may receive furtherconsideration in the light of the arguments advanced above.

I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt ofyour secret letter No.. I.D./H./2 of the 4th April with further reference to the proposedconversion of the existing mountings of the  fixed armament at Hong Kong so as tosecure an increase in the range of the weapons concerned.    2.  As has  been pointed out on more than one occasion in the past, the questionwhether   a particular alteration in  the  armament of  Hong  Kong  amounts  to an&quot; increase in the coast defences &quot; of that  place within the meaning of Article XIX of theWashington Treaty is really a technical  one on which this Department  is not in aposition to pronounce.  This being  so, I am to say that, in the light of the arguments advanced by the Chiefs of  Staff and  in view of the gun elevation which is  understood to have been carried out in certain  capital ships  of the United States and  JapaneseNavies, Sir Austen Chamberlain will not raise objection  to the alterations proposed at hong Kong, provided that the Chiefs of Staff, as the expert advisers of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in such matters, are prepared to defend,  should  the necessity arise, thethesis that these,, alterations do not involve an increase  in the coast  defences of  thatColony within the meaning of Article XIX of the  Treaty.    3.  I am to add that  it is  for the  Chiefs  of Staff Committee  to consider the bearing of the  arguments  used in your letter  under  acknowledgment on Germandisarmament, and particularly on the future of  the  coast fortifications of that country.Sir  Austen Chamberlain has some  recollection that, in the discussions on the  nowdismantled Eastern fortifications,  the German authorities employed exactly the samearguments to justify them in reconstructing the fortifications on  the most modern linesinstead of leaving them in their existing condition.
