THIS DOOTJMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRTTANKIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.                                            COPY NO. &apos;J&apos;                      CABINET.         IRON AND STEEL v-&apos;IRS - SAFEGUARDING.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.     I have received from the Iron and Steel WireManufacturers Association an application for an enquiry undertne Safeguarding of Industries procedure in regard to iron andsteel wire of all kinds.     A similar application was made in 1S25 as part of thegeneral application by the iron and steel industry, and againas a separate application at the beginning of 1926.  this latter was considered by the Cabinet, and I was authorised to reply (cab.6(26) Con. 10) that the Governments decision inregard to the application of the steel industry would applyalso to the sectional applications then under consideration,:(The other sectional application was in respect of steeljoists).     The applicants were accordingly told in February, 1926,that, &quot;The Government have given careful consideration to thearguments advanced, but they are of opinion that the sameconsideration which  debarred them from referring the largerapplication to a committee would, in fact, operate in regardto the sectional applications.11   I presume that I should inform the applicants that this decision still stands,                                      P.C.-L,Board of Trade.  7til May, 1928.
