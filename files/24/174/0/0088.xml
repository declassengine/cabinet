LETTER  OF  TRANSMISSIONNew Public Offices,Great George Street,Westminster, S.W. 1.2nd of July 1925.Deae Prime Minister,I forward herewith a Memorandum, which has been unanimously approved by my Committee, on the subject of the proposed hastening of transport developments in Africa, more particularly with a view to stimulating the production of cotton within the Empire.You will see that we have had evidence on the matter from a considerable number of witnesses including Mr. Ormsby-Gore, who indicated that he thought it would be useful for the Committee to let the Government have forthwith the information and representations which have been submitted. So far as the question of the cotton supply is concerned, the evidence we have received covers all the interests principally concerned.In forwarding the Memorandum to you on behalf of my Committee, 1 venture to express the hope that it may be of assistance to the Government in reaching a decision as to the policy to be followed.Yours faithfully,A. BALFOUR.The lit. Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., 10 Downing Street,S.W. 1. .
COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY AND trade memorandum on Transport development and Cotton-growing in East africa. The Committee on British Industry and Trade understand that certain questions with regard to financial assistance for the development of the East African Territories of the Empire, and the improvement of communications, with special reference to the stimulation of Empire Cotton Growing are now under consideration by H.M. Government.As the Committee have received a large amount of important and representative evidence as to the urgent need of developing cotton growing within the Empire they think that it may he of assistance to ELM. Government, in considering the question now before them, to submit a short summary of this evidence without awaiting the general recommendations of the Committee for the improvement of British industry and trade.2. The Shipping Merchants&apos; Committee of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce on 10th of December 1924, said: &quot;We cannot over-omphasise the importance of getting increasing supplies of raw cotton from the British Empire in particular.&quot; They further observed : &quot; The provision of supplies of cotton, alternative &quot; to the American supply is being retarded mainly by two causes. &quot; The first is that it is useless to start to provide great cotton &quot; fields while transport and marketing facilities and ginning, etc., &quot; are still in their infancy. In many, even most, of the cotton fields &quot; which are being developed at present, progress is being checked &quot; by the lack of railways and other means of transport. . . . This &quot; applies especially to Uganda and other parts of Africa. ... It &quot; is in these directions that Government help is urgently needed &quot; and on national grounds fully justified. . . . We have no hesitation-&quot; tion in urging the Committee to recommend the Government to &quot; take early and very extensive measures to promote progress on a &quot; much more thorough scale than it has yet been practicable to &quot; contemplate. We believe that something more, big in comparison &quot; with what has already been done but small from a uational budget &quot;point of view, would be justified as a measure against unemploy-&quot; ment and a stimulus to national recovery. We are satisfied that &quot; it would have a certain and extensive result of a highly beneficial &quot; character on the Lancashire cotton export trade.&quot;The Provisional Emergency Cotton Committee on 28th January, 1925, said that the fact could not be advertised too much that to grow enough suitable cotton within our Empire to make us independent .of America was a matter of such importance to Lancashire that every encouragement should be given to it by the Government, and they trusted the lime was now arriving when greater strides would be made. They were disappointed that greater progress had not been made, and they thought that India
elappeared to be the country to look to. They suggested that the Government should subsidise any company which was going about cotton growing on the right lines.The Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association, on 18th of March 1925, quoted statistics showing that, while about 8  million bales of American cotton were available in 1913 after the American mills had secured their supplies, the average quantity in the years 1921 1924 had been reduced to approximately 5 million bales, and they submitted that it was an urgent necessity to encourage the activities of the JEmpire Cotton Growing Corporation. The Association stated in their evidence : &quot; The chief direction &quot; in which it would appear that the Committee on Industry and &quot; Trade could assist the efforts of the Corporation is in emphasising &quot; the need for further transport facilities in the various cotton &quot; growing Dependencies and Colonies. The provision of the &quot; necessary capital to build railways, and arrangements whereby they &quot; could be financed during the first few years . . . are vital to the &quot; extension of Empire Cotton Growing.&quot; In summing up the reasons for the decline in British exports of cotton goods, the Association placed in the Eorefront the shortage of raw cotton and its high price, and said : &quot; We cannot too strongly urge upon your Committee &quot; the necessity of advising the Government to do all in their power &quot;to encourage the growing of cotton within the Empire by &quot; extending as quickly and as fully as possible the transport facilities &quot; for cotton from the new cotton growing areas now being developed &quot; to the ports.&quot; The witnesses representing the Association were , asked whether Empire cotton was able to replace American cotton in quality, and they gave the reply that the Uganda cotton is better and that the American seed is being grown largely in the Sudan with great success.Tho Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations, having pointed out in their evidence on 8th of April 1925, that perhaps the principal factor upon which the output of cotton yarn depended was the supply of raw material, submitted that the work of the Empire . Cotton Growing Corporation and the British Cotton Growing Association should be speeded on with the utmost despatch. The Federation said : &quot;The increase of supplies by the development of &quot; the cotton growing countries of the Empire can be substantially &quot;advanced by increased Government facilities for transport in &quot; those Colonies and Dependencies which have already shown that &quot;cotton can be advantageously produced.&quot; The Federation further stated that every avenue of transport in the African Colonies had been filled up as fast as those transport arrangements had been made, and they expressed the view that no private firm would be able to arrange transport because of the laws of land tenure ; and that as the railway service was in the interest of all traders it was natural for the Government to provide it.The Manchester Cotton Association on 8th of April 1925, stated that the Association was keenly interested in the development of cotton growing within the Empire and the advantages that are to&apos; obtained by thedevelopment of trade between the cotton-growing colonies and this country. The Association was strongly of opinion that it is in the interests of this country and the Empire that the53773 1 a 2
Government should give the fullest measure of support to this question of; cotton growing; because the production of a greater quantity of cotton in countries other than America would tend to bring about greater stability in prices a..great, asset to legitimate trading and because those culoniea which are becoming more and more&apos; interested in cotton; growing are enriching, themselves and thereby enabling the inhabitants to make greater purchases of clothing, which is of the utmost importance to - Lancashire and this country as a whole.- The Liverpool Cotton&apos;Association has informed the Committee that the Association&apos; strongly supports any Government actions which may be taken to encourage and support the growth of cotton within the Empire, and that any action to provide transport in East Africa for the conveyance of cotton to the ports would be carrying out one. of the greatest necessities, as; without such transport, the costs on the cotton are so high that it is difficult to compete with other countries. The Association, further, said: &quot;We feel that the future of the cotton trade in this country is largely dependent upon the growth of cotton within the Empire, and, therefore, we give our support in every way to any action which may be taken to encourage sueh growths.&quot;&apos;In a statement submitted to the Committee dated 9th of February 1925, the United Textile Workers&apos;Association said:  &quot;To enable, the trade to purchase its raw material under the most &quot;favourable: conditions,.it is essential that the American supply of &quot;cotton should be supplemented by developing the cotton fieldswithin our own Empire. The British Cotton Growing Associa-&quot;&quot;tiou and the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation are putting &quot;forth every effort to ncoomplish this, but they have been &quot;handicapped for want of funds. There is need for every effort &quot;to be put forth -by the Government and by the Trade, not ooly in &quot;the actual growing of cotton, but in facilitating in every way the &quot; transport and marketing of the raw material as cheaply as &quot;possible.&quot;3. From the evidence of these bodies it is impossible not to draw the conclusion that, so far as the cotton industry ia^ concerned, there is complete unanimity as. to the. desirability of additional encouragement&apos;being given to Empire Cotton Growing, and as to the necessity for the provision of additional transport facilities for this purpose. The Committee accordingly invited the Director of the Empire Cotton Growing Corporation and. the General Manager of the British Cotton. Growing Association to give, them the benefit of their expert evidence. On 29th of April 192.5, these gentlemen explained the difficulties which had been met, and&apos; the work which had been done by the two organisations&apos;. Having, described the problem caused, by shortage of the American crop, the General Manager of the British Cotton. Growing Association said : &quot; We &quot;naturally turn to our great tropical and sub-tropical possessions, &quot;where large areas undoubtedly lend themselves to the growing of &quot;-cotton&quot;! and &quot;The Association has already performed most &quot;valuable exploration and development work in connection with &quot; this question.   Of late years the Empire Cotton Growing Cor-
&quot; poration has rendered invaluable help . . . .&quot; These witnesses indicated various specific areas in Africa which investigation had distinguished as being suitable for cotton growing ; and they expressed the opinion that what has already been accomplished is sufficient guarantee that the Empire is capable of producing very large quantities of excellent cotton. Further, their evidence supported the view that, while certain other difficulties remain to be faced, the primary necessity is for the provision of further transport facilities in the African Colonies and Dependencies. Both these witnesses were strongly of opinion that  or this purpose some more . elastic methods of financing railway development than those possible at present must be found.4. In view of the anticipation that, should an extended scheme of railway development be put into operation, orders for large quantities of material would be placed in Great Britain reference may suitably be made to certain views expressed in evidence by witnesses representing the iron and steel and engineering industries.The Agricultural Engineers&apos; Association on 26th of November 1924, cited as two of the reasons for the unsatisfactory state of the agricultural engineering industry the reduction in the purchasing power of ihe world and the loss of various export markets ; and they agreed in reply to a question, that East Africa was a safe area for development from the point of view of the agricultural engineering industry.The Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, on 11th of February 1925, having pointed out the importance to the iron and steel industry of its export trade, stated that the volume of exports of iron and steel in 1923 were only 86*9 per cent, of the 1913 figures.The National Federation of Iron and Steel Manufacturers on 25th of February 1925, in analysing the causes for the inability of the British iron and steel industry effectively to meet foreign corn-petition at the present time either in its home or overseas markets, gave prominence to under-consumption especially in export markets. In reply to a suggestion that the only thing for the trade to do in regard to this question of under-consumption was to try to create demands in new markets, the Federation expressed the view that a potential demand existed and that endeavours should be made to render it effective.The British Engineers&apos; Association, on 1st of April 1925, pointed out that the volume of exports of machinery in 1924 was only 67-3 per cent, of the 1913 figures and cited as one of the causes of this state of affairs the inadequate demand for engineering products at present prices. The Association expressed the opinion that this under-consumption in many of the markets of .the world was due to the inadequacy of their active purchasing power.The Locomotive Manufacturers&apos; Association, on 17th of June 1925, stated that, while the average annual exports of rail loco-motives during the years 1911 to 1913 amounted to 44,614 tons, the corresponding figure for 1924 was 23,563 tons, and the figure for the first five months of 1925 17,437 tons. The Association gave, as one of the main factors which had created this position,   the
inadequacy of Available markets to absorb the locomotives produced by the increased capacity of the world ; and, when asked whether railway development in East Africa would be an important stimulant to the industry, expressed the opinion that everything was of importance which would in any way increase orders placed in the home market since, in their opinion, the locomotive industry was at the present time eating up its reserves.In view of this evidence that these industries are suffering from lack of demand for their products from overseas, it appears that the placing of orders with them for railway material for use in the Dependencies and . Colonies would be of great advantage, both to those industries themselves and to national prosperity generally.5. An invitation was accordingly sent to the Hon. W. G. A. Ormsby-Gore, M.P., Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, to give the &quot;Committee the benefit of his views on his return from his tour of the East African Colonies and Dependencies, as Chair-man of the East Africa Commission. On 26th of May 1925, he explained the definite conclusions of the Commission that the further economic development of these East African territories is dependent on the early provision of increased transport facilities ; that little or nothing can be done without liberal financial assistance from the Imperial Government; and that an East Africa Loan Guarantee Bill authorising the issue of a loan for  10,000,000, guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Imperial government-ment, should be introduced, the money so obtained to be used for railway extensions (in particular the 800 miles of new railway in Tanganyika and 200 miles in Uganda described in the Commission^ report), harbour developments and the provision of other transport facilities.Mr. Ormsby-Gore pointed out that, if the surveys for the new railways which he suggests in Tanganyika are not commenced this autumn, or those in Uganda next year, the expert staffs may have to be disbanded, with the consequence that, should a decision in favour of railway development in those territories be postponed too long, difficulty, expense and delay will be experienced in re-assembling a constructional staff.6. The Committee appreciate that there are a number of difficulties to be faced locally in connection with the development of the East African Colonies and Dependencies, which will no doubt require time and careful administration to overcome. It will, of course, be necessary to ensure that development is not carried on either more extensivaly or more rapidly than is consistent, with the interests of the native population on the one hand and its capacity on the other. Effective safeguards to the satisfaction of the Imperial Government will no doubt be necessary in connection with the supply and conditions of labour, both for the construction and working of the proposed railways and for producing cotton or other crops. There are, also, serious difficulties in conne3tion with land tenure. Further, it is probable that enquiry could be held with advantage into questions of climate and soil, and into questions of a
botanical and scientific nature ; and research may have to be undertaken on a substantial scale into such questions as the spread of the tsetse fly.The Committee do not wish to appear to minimise the importance of the most careful examination of these problems, with a view to the wisest solution being reached. Their terms of reference, how-ever, instruct them &quot; to enquire into the prospects of British industry and commerce and to make recommendations in regard thereto &quot;; and they feel that, having received a definite suggestion supported by the unanimous views of so important a section of British industry as the cotton trade, they are compelled to look at the problem from the point of view of its effect on trade and employment in this country. In the light of the evidence quoted above, there appears to be no reasonable doubt that British trade and employment would substantially benefit not only from the immediate demand for the products of the iron and steel and engineering industries and the prospective increase of raw cotton supplies, but also, eventually, in many 1 other ways, through the added piurchasing power of the population of the African territories affected. While feeling it their duty to call attention to the importance of the local problems which must arise in connection with the proposed, development, the Committee do not feel competent as a Committee to express any views as to the best methods of dealing with these, as they have no means of investigating them.7. It should also be made clear that, as the Committee are not in a position to review suggestions based on a study of the problem in detail on the spot, they are not necessarily recommending the spending of specific sums on the definite railway lines suggested in the Report of the East Africa Commission. It follows that they are expressing no opinion as to the immediate commercial prospects of those lines, although, even should the railways themselves fail to yield for some time a financial return, there are important compensa-tory factors to be taken into account baving regard to the objects for which the railways were constructed.8. Subject to the considerations referred to in Paragraphs 6 and 7, the Committee submit in conclusion :(a) That British Industry, and in particular British export trade, would derive very considerable benefit from the develop-ment of the East African Colonies and Dependencies.(b) That for the encouragement of such development, the primary need is the provision of further transport, in particular railways ; and(c) That in order to secure the building of railways with sufficient rapidity, some additional facilities for meeting the necessary expenditure should be evolved.30th of June 1925.(53773)  Wt. 8473-24567/654 250Q 7/35 H.
