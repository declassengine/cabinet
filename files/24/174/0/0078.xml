THIS document^jrS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.\j   **-  a   j. Vi   2i   x * -ViS(DJ^TC/SS;. Copy No.0 LWEST   HAM.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I am afraid I must trouble my colleagues far a decision on the action to be taken in tho case of the West Ham Union.The West Ham Guardians are expending in every half-year from  200,000 to  300,000 (from  500,000 to  600,000 a year) more than can be raised by rates in the Union.     The present yearly rate for poor law purposes alone amounts to 9/- in tho  , the total rate in the Borough of West Ham being 24/6 in the  .     The expenditure on out relief in particular Is extravagant, partly because the scale on ishich. relief is given is high, but still raoro because the policy of the Guardians is such as to lead to a great increase in the numbers relieved.Since March, 1922, the deficit of each half years&apos;s administration has been met by the advance of a loan on the recommendation of the Committee of which Sir Harry Goschen, K.B.E., is Chairman, and, In pursuance of the terms of reference of that Committoe, attempts have on each occasion of borrowing been made to restrict the extravagance of the Guardians, so far as thors tr-an be done by limiting tho scale on which relief has been given.     It must be said for the Guardians, that, though they have resisted the conditions proposed, from time to time, and it has been necessary In some instances to modify them before their acceptance could be secured, yet the information available suggests that, once a condition has been accepted, it has been fully observed. This loyalty of observance is largely due to the permanent- staff of tho Union..
An appli^atlon^i^-a Jloaji-^ - 3SO,.-000 was made to me In June in respect of expenditure In the current half-year.   The Guardians were interviewed by me and by the Goschen committee and that Committee recommended that certain further conditions should be imposed to reduce the rate of expenditure.   These conditions the Guardians have declined to entertain and have steadily maintained this attitude and refusod even to negotiate in spite of persistent offorts of the Labour Members of Parliament for the area comprised in the Union to induco a more reasonable attitude.It is Impossible for me to grant the loan for which application has been made while the Guardians adhere to their present attitude.     In the absence of a loan the position will be that on or soon after tho 10th September the Guardians will not have sufficient money to continue the payment of relief.     There is no legal authority under whioh I can step in to take the Guardians1 place, and in view of the early rising of Parliament I cannot hope at present to secure the legislation necessary to give me such an authority. On the other, hand It is impossible to contemplate a sudden cessation of relief in this large Union.     In these circumstances I see no alternative to action on my part without statutory authority, to be subsequently covered by indemnifying legislation.       It is possible that when the Guardians meet on the 10th September after their recess they may be more amenable, but they are under strong local pressure from a Trades and Labour Council, which appears to be communistic and antagonistic to the Labour Members of Parliament for the area, and I must contemplate the possibility of their either refusing to function or purporting to function and continuing to give orders for relief though knowing that those orders must be fruitless for want of money.
In cither event It may be neoessary for me to make arrangements for the relief of the poor in tho Union and the management of tho institutions of the Guardians; from seme date very shortly after the 10th September until legislation can be obtained in the Autumn Session, and to find the whole of the money required for the purpose.I am advised by the Clerk to tho Guardians, that I can rely upon the assistance of the permanent staff of the Union in any measures which   I have to take.     Any poor law offIcor can bo dismissed by me and the senior poor law officers cannot be dismissod or have their salaries reduced without my sanction.   If tho Clerk1 s advice should by any chance prove to be ill-founded, the position will be more difficult, though not in essentials different.I am proposing to pay necessary monies to the Clerk to the Guardians for relief, to instruct the Relieving Officers that they are to relievo in accordance with the Guardians 1 scale, modified as if the conditions proposed by the Goschen Ccmmlttee had been adopted, and to secure the assistance of an advisory committee, whioh may probably be manned by members offLondon Boards of Guardians.It la estimated that the amount of money which might be required during the period above Indicated would not exceed  500,000 and it is suggested that advances should be made for the purpose from the Civil Contingencies Fund.     I should propose in the law to be passed in tho Autumn Session to indemnify all persons concerned in respect of action taken during the emergency, to charge upon the ratepayers of West Ham the sums expended out of tho Civil Contingencies Fund on their -behalf, and to make provision for the appointment of persons to act in the place of the Guardians, with all the powers of the Guardians, including those of borrowing monoy on the security of the ratos. As soon as tho legislation is obtained the advances from the Civil Contingencies Fund would be repaid in the first instance
out of loan money advanced, if necessary, by the Ministry of Health on the recommendation of the Goschen Committee from the relief of Unemployment Vote, such loan money being secured on the rates.I am bound to warn my oolleagues that unless on tho 10th of September the Guardians should be in a more reasonable frame of mind and a settlement bo found practicable, there may well be risk of sane civil disturbance in the area in view of the Communist influence under which the Guardians are acting.   There is also the contingency that, the County Borough Council of West Ham and other authorities In the West Ham Poor Law Union may make common cause with the Guardians, to tho extent even of refusing to function.It appears to me that these possibilities will have to be dealt with as and when they arise.   La my judgment it is   Impossible through fear of them to surrender to tho West-Ham Guardians and I think the best way of inducing those Guardians to see reason is to remain absolutely firm and to make them understand that we are quito prepared, if need be, to supersede thorn.I Shall be glad to have tho   formal approval of the Cabinet for the steps proposed to be taken.(Litld.)     N.C.MINISTRY OP HEALTH,Whitehall, S*W*1.August 3rd, 1925.
