The underlying principle is that each of the Government Departments must be responsible within the limits of its available resources for seeing that such arrange-ments as are possible are made for dealing with the emergency situation so far as it may be affected by matters within the sphere of that Department.(2)     Supply^ and Transport Standing Sub-Cpiumitt ee. This consists of representatives of all the Departments concerned under the Chairmanship of the Chief Civil Commissioner, and   Is entrusted with the duty of co-ordinating Departmental arrangements in normal times.    On the outbreak of an emergency the Committee splits up as the need arises into the following bodies, the Chairmen of which constitute a co-ordinating Committee under the Chief Civil Gommissioner:-(a) Food, Fuel and Transport Sub-CpmniitteenThis Sub-Committee consists of representatives of the Departments concerned with the provision and transport of essential supplies, and is responsible for supervising and co-ordinating the execution of schemes for the supply and transport of food and fuel.     For the purposes of(i) controlling the movement of essential food stuffs coastwise and controlling vessels engaged on home trade services, and(ii) the management of matters relating to tho movement of coal by sea and the supply of bunker coal to maintain essential services,it is further divided into a V/ater Transport Committee and aShipping Sub-Committee respectively, (b)

RECRUIT1 iENT OF LABOUR.The Volunteer Services Committees are responsible for arrangements for. the registration and recruitment:.; in an emergency, of volunteer labour required in connection with Services of a definite national character, e.g. postal services, the maintenance of railway communications, the transport of food from one locality to another, and services connected with the unloading of shipping.     the maintenance of essential local services in the event of a withdrawal of labour from local gas works,     water-works; and other public utility services is the responsibility of the Local Authority concerned, but. the arrangements contemplate that the Volunteer Services Committe.es should actively co-operate with the Local Authority, except in the rare cases where the latter is unwilling to do so.     No difficulty was experienced in securing such co-operation in 1921.The exact procedure for the reception, registration and allocation of volunteers is left to the discretion of each Volunteer Service Committee, subject to the advide and direction of the Civil Commissioner and his staff, but a form of poster appealing for.volunteers has been settled for general use and the Chairmen have precise instructions as regards expenditure.     Arrangements provide that on receipt of a precautionary warning the Chairman will get into touch with the Clerks to the principal Local Authorities, with a view to making the necessary arrangements to put in/it or c e
foroe the plans which will severally have been made for the opening of recruiting offices and dealing with volunteers,      This warning would be given by telegram before the &quot;action&quot; telegram, on receipt of which the machinery would start actually to operate. The Voluneetr Service Committees would be in a position to start work within twelve hours of the latter telegram, on the assumption that they had received 24 hours&apos; warning before,Applications for volunteer labour would be made, usually, from the food or other trader concerned, to the Chairman of the Volunteer Service Committee, who would decide, after consultation with the appropriate expert, whether to meet, the aoplicatj.on, assuming that he was in a position to do so,      Each local representative of a National. Service would report daily to the Chairman any deficiency of volunteers required for the service, and any surplus volunteers possessing special skill and willing to work away from home, and a summary of such statements would be forwarded, on the same day, by the Chairman to the Civil Commissioner for his districtoPROTECTION.The problem of protection may be conveniently considered under two main heads -(a)
suppression of disturbances, and(b)the provision of specific protection forvulnerable points, convoys, and volunteerworkersetc oUnder the first head no specific provision can as a rule be made in advance, beyond measures for strengthen-ing the available forces, placing them in the most advantageous position and arranging means of transport, communication, etc.     These measures have also to be considered in relation to (1) the Police and (2) the armed forces of the Grown, and there are two main principles which lave generally been observed and will presumably be followed in any emergency no?/ contemplated namely, - that the primary responsibility for the maintenance of order In any particular district rests with the responsible local police authorities, and that recourse should only be had to the armed forces of the Grown when the resources (f tie civil police have become exhausted or it is clear that the Police would be unable without military assistance to deal with a situation which is developing.MEASURES FOR THE PRESERVATION&quot; OF ORDER.As to the arrangements for the preservation of order, the local measures must be in the main left to the judgment of the responsible Chief Officer of Police4 Generally speaking, the Police are not, and cannot be, maintained at a/strength
strength sufficient to enable the Chief Constable to afford specific protection at any large number of points-% Generally speaking, he must collect his men at convenient centres and Laia them available tc act as and.when occasion requires.The measures falling within the scope of the central authority fall under the following main heads -(&amp;) measures for augmenting the Police Forces, either on a permanent footing or by the temporary employment of pensioners or other &quot;reserves&quot;.     Most forces are at present maintained somewhat below the full authorised establishment, and many have pensioners and others who are registered as prepared to join the force temporarily in an emergency.     These reserves total about &amp;,000:    their value may be somewhat doubtful but many of them could probably be usefully employed In the quieter areas and so free the regular Police for action where disturbances are to be anticipated.     The only action therefore under this head is to notify Chief Officers of Police of the conditions under which men may be added either permanently or temporarily to the force, and this would be done by the Home Office in advance of any threatened emergency.fb) Fmployinent of Special Constables.    There are atpresent in England and Wales about 100,000 registeredspecial constables.    Their distribution variesconsiderably from force to force,  and generallyvery- few are available in the industrial districts.Their value in the disturbed districts Is not likely to be great., but, like the Police Reserves,theymav
may be useful in freeing the regular Police. It will be a question for consideration whether on the occurrence of an emergency a general appeal should be issued by the Govern-ment for special constables, or whether the issue of such an appeal should be left to the discretion of the several Chief Constables.      Probably, in view of the very varying looal circumstances, the latter would be the better course.    It is also to be remembered that a general appeal for special constables might have tho undesirable effect of attracting applications from men who might be more, usefully employed in other capacities.(a) Borrowing of Police froia other forces.      In -the case of an emergency which seriously affects only particular districts, important assistance may be obtained-&quot;by&quot;borrowing from other forces.     To facilitate these arrangements a general Mutual Aid Agreement has been drawn up and the Home Office would co-ordinate the measure and assist Chief Constables to obtain men so far as possible, but, apart from the Metropolitan Police (which is under the control of the Home Secretary) there is no power to require one foroe to send men in aid of another. Military Aid.The responsibility for summoning the military in aid of the civil power rests with the civil authorities * The procedure has been precisely laid down, and is fully understood
55 j.understood both by the Police and the military authorities.      It has been laid down that movements of troops from a distance are only to be made after reference to the War Office and the Home Office, who would be kept advised as to the local situation.      It is a matter fox consideration whether, on the Imminence of an emergency, preparatory movements of troops should be made to centres more conveniently situated in regard to probable calls for assistance.      Such movements,  as a rule, could not be carried out without attracting some public notice and might,, of course, be regarded in some quarters as provocative. On some occasions, it has been useful, as a precautionary measure, to send a warship to a port where disturbances are threatened, but any such movement must also be considered in relation to the effect on local feeling.Protection of vulnerable points... etc.In previous emergencies, the protection of vulnerable points has in the main been left to the discretion of Chief Officers of Police to arrange and carry out, so far as their available resources will permit, but it Is clear that no Chief Constable will be able to afford any considerable protection from his regular Police and Special Constables,, though they may be usefully employed for watching purposes, may be regarded as of doubtful value where there is any probability of any determined attack being made.      Steps have in some cases been taken to provide military protection, but in any such measures care must of course be taken to avoid dissipating troops who may be required to act in support of the civil powers.&apos;    Uo specific provision for this purpose has at present been made.Lists. ..&quot;
Lists of certain categories of vulnerable points, includingpetrol stores, are available at the Home Office, and theBaffle particulars have been coimaunlcated to military commands,however, &apos;but these lists/do not cover the whole ground and do not sufficiently distinguish the points of first importance,     It ,is proposed to obtain from the respective Chief Officers of Police classified lists of the most important points, the destrtbction of which would seriously. interfere with the life of the community, to take steps through the Police to encourage those responsible for control of the work in question to provide watchmen and to consider what measures o can,  if need arises, be taken for their further protection. As regards the protection of convoys, whether of food, coal, etc.,  it is clear that the necessary measures must be concerted concurrently with any arrangements which raey be made for the convoys themselves, and in the event of widespread disturbances it must be assumed that the Police will not be in a position to spare any large number of men for convoy duty.    The measures for dealing with what is tho most difficult as well as perhaps the most important aspect of the problem, namely, the protection of workers of all kinds who are prepared to continue at work, whether at docks, power stations,  on trans-port services, telegraphs, telephones or whatever it may be, can hardly bo concerted except in relation to each contingency as it arises *Arm? Reserves, Defence Force, etc.In the event of widespread and continuing disturbances, it would be necessary to consider tho question of calling up the Reserves and/or enrolling a special force sue!?, as tiu-Defence Force which was constitutor: during the general- coal strike of 1921.
li     Duties of the. Mines Department.The Mines Department is responsible for providing an organisation to deal with all matters relative to the conser-vation, distribution, and, if necessary, importation of fuel during an emergency.2.     Powers.On the declaration by Royal Proclamation of a state of emergency, the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, comes into operation.     This Act provides for the Issue of Regulations empowering Departments to take whatever action may be necessary for securing the essentials of life to the    community Draft Regulations under that Act are prepared by the Home Office, in consultation with other Government Departments, and the Regulations  vhich particularly concern Mines Depart-ment emergency activities are kept up to date in readiness for issue when a state of emergency is declared,     These Regulations empower the Secretary for Mines to issue Directions with regard to the detailed steps to be taken for the conservation of fuel supplies.     As in the case of the Regulations the Directions are kept in draft from but their final form naturally cannot be determined until the nature of the emergency Is known.3.     Action to be taken.The efficiency of the emergency organisation of the Mines Department was thoroughly tested during the national Coal Stoppage of April to July 1921, and. full advantage has been taken of the experience thus gained in revising and strengthen-ing the arrangements to meet any future emergency.The
The action to be taken falls broadly under three heads(a) That dealing with export, bunkering and the movementof coal In ships.(b) That regulating inland distribution and enforcingrestrictions on consumption.,(c) That making provision for tho&apos;importation of fuel,if necessary.   JAs regards (aj, a scheme, prepared in conjuctlon with the Customs,  the Mercantile Marine Department,  the Admiralty and the Ministrt.of Agriculture and Fisheries,  will operate by which&apos;the export of fuel will be stopped and control imposed upon the bunkering of all ships.     The movement of all British ships loaded with coal will also be controlled.     When necessary to send emergency supplies to particular centres the Mercantile Marine Department will requisition the ship and arrange with certain firms of coal shippers and receiving agents appointed by the Mines Department to handle the cargo of coal the consumers in need Of the, coal being required to give an undertaking to pay a price to cover all costs.As regards (b) the Directions as drafted -provide inter alia for:-(l) A census of stocks in the country to be taken, .(li) The formulation of priority arrangements for meeting the essential requirements of householders,  ... industries producing food and drink, hospitals, gas works, electricity works, sewage works and other public utility undertakings. \(iii)   The restriction of the supply of coal to households.(lv)   The curtailment of industrial coal consumption. (v)    The restriction of railway and steamship services, (yi) All lighting and heating to be reduced to a minimum.As regards (c) it will be the duty of the Mines Departmentto watch the stocks of fuel available in the country and toprepare estimates of the time that supplies will last upon thebasis of restricted consumption;     The Government will be adviswhen
when steaks are lilrely fee bo exhausted and in the event e a decision by the Cabinet that coal from abroad must be obtained on Government account to meet the essential needs of the community, steps will be taken to bring coal into the country upon the best poselble terr-s.     Ko detailed plans for the importation of coal have been prepared and the arrangements to be followed must depend on the circumstances which obtain at the time.Mines Department Organisation.The efficiency of the  lines Department Emergency scheme depends mainly upon close co-operation with the coal trade and the Local Authorities, vvho will in a large measure be responsible, under the guidance of the Mines Department, for giving effect to the policy and directions of the Government so far as retail distribution and the conservation of existing supplies are concerned.The various Mines Department Committees will be appointed on the declaration of an emergency,(a)   Shipping; Emergency Committee.*        &apos; ii   I......      iiVr       v - - ii- --r-TT&quot;-1-*---------------&quot;&apos; .........This Committee, which will be in continuous session at the headquarters of the Lines Department, is responsible for dealing with export and Bunkering1 and regulates, through the Local Shipping Emergency Committees at the principal coal loading ports mentioned below, the shipment of coal abroad or coastwise and tho provision of bunkers for all purposes.     The composition of the Committee is :-Mines Department 2 members, (includingChairmanAdmiralty1 memberCustoms &amp; Excise1 memberMercantile Marine Department2 membersMinistry of Agricul-turo &amp; fisheries memberFishery Board for scotland memberwith a Secretary from the Mines Department./Local
C r3 3 0Local Shipping Emergency Cor.milttees are set up atCardiff Glasgow Hull.Liverpool Kewcastle-on-Tyne.and ot each of these ports a direct representative of the Mines Department (known as the Ports Representative) is appointed to. serve on the Local Committee with responsibility .   for regulating the movement of coal inland from the Port Areas. (Special provision is made In-the Emergency Directions to . meet this).     . ,(b) Central Coal Emergency Committee.This Committoe is also a Headquarters Committee and consists of coal owners, coal factors, merchants and representatives of the Mines Department.     It is responsible for the distribution of coal for inlsnd needs throughout the whole of Great Britain (except the Metropolitan and Home Counties Fuel Area).In the Coal producing areas District Opal Emergency Cprrordttoes are appointed consisting of colliery owners, coal factors, coal merchants and coal consumers.     These. Distriot Committees are responsible for the disposal of coal from collieries In their areas and any other bulk supplies which the Secretary for Mines may make available to them.( o I he t r op ol i t an and Home C our ties Eme r ge nc y C ommi t1 e ea. -..Special conditions exist in the Metropolitan and Home Counties area owing to its populous nature and its distance from the coal producing districts.     A separate -Committee is accordingly formed consisting of coal traders, &apos;the London Chamber of Commerce, the London County Council., Gas and Electricity Undertakings and the Mines Department,, and this Committee is given powers to insist upon uniform practice.&quot; being followed, throughout the Metropolitan and -Home Counties Fuel Area in relation to the supply and - consumption of coal.There are also .the following Emergency Officers assisting in the administration of the Emergency Directions.(d)&quot;Divisional Coal Officers.A&apos;Dlvisional Coal Officer is appointed for each Civil Commissioner^ area, and, besides acting as the Fuel Adviser to the Civil Commissioner, is responsible for the emergency work within his area and for co-ordinating the activities of the Local Authorities and Coal Emergency Officers in that area.     He maintains liaison between the consumers and the District Coal Emergency Committee (on which he serves) and also between the Mines Department organisation in the area md that of the Food and Transport Department.?..     There are thirteen Divisional Coal Officers (two being appointed for London and the Home Counties Division).(e) Goal Emergency Officers.These officers are coal merchants or factors of standing who are each responsible for a small group of Local Authorities areas.     They are required to ace that the distribution of coal within their districts is carried out in accordance with the Emergency Directions and to ensure that Local Authorities are performing the duties allotted to them.     These Officers are in the main nominated by the Coal Merchants- Federation or the national council of Coal Traders and they are able to influence the coal trade in using stocks to the best advantage and in accordance with the instructions in force.
(f)     Local Authorities,The Local Authorities are responsible so far as the distribution of fuel supplies in their own areas is con-concerned for enforcing the Emergency Directions and, to a large extent the successful functioning of the organisation depends on the full co-operation of the Local Authorities in this work.    Provision is rsade for the appointment by the trade, of a Goal Merchants CommittoB in each Local Authority&quot; a area&quot;to advise ths Authority as to the best method of conserving coal within the area and distributing stocks in accordance with the orders in force.Slight variations in the scheme of organisation have been made to meet special circumstances in Scotland, inasmuch,as, for the whole of the country, there is a Scottish Emergency Counoil, at Edinburgh, in charge of emergency arrangements.   It has therefore been necessary to amend the Mines Department Emergency Organisation in minor details in order that it may take its proper place in the Scottish scheme as a whole.   The Mines Department Divisional Coal Officer will be stationed at Edinburgh and will act in olose touch with the Emergency Council while an Assistant Divisional Coal Officer will be stationed at Glasgow and work with the District Coal Emergency Committee. The Mines Department organisation, while it is advisory to the Scottish Council, is under the control of the Headquarters of the Mines Department.    The changes of detail have all been agreed with the Scottish Office.5.     Liaison between Mines Department and other i GovernmentDapartmentg.The Uines Department is represented \vith the other Govern-ment Departments concerned upon the Pood, Fuel and^  Transport Committee,^ which is called together upon the declaration of emergency and is responsible for general policy.This Committee takes the place of the Coal Sub-Committee whioh functioned during the coal stoppage of 1921 and its conetitu-tion is vory similar^
6.        Oost of Emergency Organisation.In times of industrial peace a maximum amount of  200 is provided in the estimates of the Department (although not shown separately) for necessary work in keeping the out-line of the emergency organisation in being.     In emergency the expenditure is fairly heavy, but very much less than it would be had the department not been able to take advantage of the voluntary help provided by the coal trade organisations. The majority of the Divisional Goal Officers and practically all the Goal Emergency Officers are unpaid, as are some of the Forts Representatives.     3o far as the Mines Department is able to estimate beforehand the emergency expenditure likely to be incurred, the necessary Treasury authority is secured.   During the emergency, matters involving expenditure which eould not be anticipated are referred to a Finance Sub-Committee on which the Mines Department and other Departments concerned are repres-ented, and to which the Treasury, with the approval Of the Cabinet,  delegates its powers for dealing with emergency expenditure. 7.     Secrecy.It is necessary, during tho preparation of the emergency scheme, to consult the Divisional Coal Officers and -a few,other people.    This number is kept down to a minimum and those who have to be informed of the Department&apos;s plane are pledged to secrecy. 8*       Arrangements on 50th July.Ill arrangements for the above purposes had   been completed by 30th July, except that(1) One of the District Goal Emergency Committees (para-;rraph 4(b)) had not bean completed.     This has now been done.(2)
(3)    The Metropolitan and Home Counties Smergenoy Committee (paragraph 4(o)) had not been completed but preliminary discussions had taken place with the Chairman.(3)    The schedule of districts for the purposes of the Instructions to Local  authorities (paragraph 4(b)) was not actually ready for issue but would have been urgently printed by the Stationery Office.Arrangements had also been made for adding to the Headquarters staff of the Kines Department certain officers previously employed in the Deiartment who had experience of emergency work.
EKERG-KKCY, ARRAflGKMEKTS . - -MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT.&apos;Road transport.The organisation, of emergency road transport would root upon Road Commissioners in each Emergency Division with Haulage committees and Road Officers at each Sub-centre.The Road Commissioners were all appointed and each Commissioner had prepared a list of Road officers for the various centres in his Division,   on receipt of a telegram each Road Commissioner was ready to proceed to his Emergency Headquarters and to appoint Ms Road officers - the majority of whom load had experience In previous Emergencies.Chairmen of Haulage Committees had been approached to act at 82 sub-centres and were prepared to set up their Committees oh receipt of a telegram.Detailed instructions load been prepared arid were ready for immediate issue to Road commissioners, Road officers and Chairman of Haulage Committees.   Copies of these Instructions are annexed. (See; Appendix).Within the limits of the instructions the arrajagemeuats for the organisation, of road transport by the Ministry had been fully developed.Lorry Drivers.No possible estimate of the number of lorry drivers who would be needed could be framed until the extent of a strike of road transport workers were known.   Road officers in each area would be in close touch with the Volunteer Service Committee for the area with a view to the recruitment pt any tmergenoy drivers who would be reqviired.   Discussions load already taken place with the Automobile Association, and the Royal Automobile Club and those organisations would have assisted as an previous occasions not only in obtaining volunteer drivers for lorries but also volunteers to drive their own light cars and motor cycles.
Rai.lwa^i Companies.The position had been discussed with the Railway General Manager&apos;s Committee who had decided that the compatiiea could carry on for a week even with the embargo on moving coal as announced by the Unions.   A Railway Kepresentatlve had been nominated to advise the Civil Commissioner a at each Emergency Divisional Headquarters and local representatives at a number of sub-centres vihere railway interests were important.   These railway representatives would act with the Volunteer Service Ccararalttees with a view to obtaining emergency labour If and when required by the Hallway CcanpanlesDock Authorities.The position had been thoroughly discussed with the Secretary of the National Council of the port Labour Employers, whioh Is representative both of Harbour Authorities and of Ship Owners.   Be advised that if the Association were approached officially the fact would immediately bacorco public property.   Tho names of local Secretaries of the Association were therefore obtained and these were being approached at the more impox^tant cargo ports for the purpose of arranging the special recruitment off port Labour, working in conjunction with the Local Volunteer Service Committee, and for the nomination of representatives to serve on the Water Transport District committees.BLECTRICXL POttEa STATIONS IN GREATER LOiOQK AREAjTAVAL RATINGS. A detailed plan exists for operating the principal generating stations in the London area.   Arrangements have bos: made with the Admiralty for the supply of 663 naval ratings (Including 11 officers) for operating the boiler houses.   lbs Admiralty are responsible for tho conveyance of those ratings1 Greenvrich and from thence they will be transferred to billets at the Duke of Tork?s Headquarters,, Chelsea, and at Flodden ffl Headquarters, Gamberwell,   The military authorities have aasu&quot;18
responsibility for rationing the naval ratings both, at their billets and at the Power Stations to which they will be detailed. Lists of the Povier Stations have been furnished to the Home office in order that protection may be provided if necessary.The scheme depends on the oo-operatlon of the chief technical assistants in the various Power Stations who it is expected will remain on duty.   They will be strengthened by volunteers drawn from members of the various Engineerings; Institutions, University Colleges, &amp;o*    Lists of volunteers are available, which were brought up to date two years ago, and the more responsible of these volunteers have been allocated to definite posts in the Stations.
f c o3 0..  ambbsejoy DIS-GBRiBUTIQI? . Off; FOOD. OHSaMIS AoH.The Headciuarters Staff consists of a small, nucleus of officers,  and arrangements have been made for supplementing this nucleus by borrowing- from other Departments staff who have had previous experience of this work in an emergency.A panel &quot;of advisers on each of the important oommodoties has been appointed and the individuals concerned have agreed to act,PRO VINO IAL ORG AN IS AT ION.     A Divisional ffood Officer has been appointed for each of the areas&apos; of the Civil Commissioners. All these. Officers have been seen or communicated with recently and all of them- are prepared to function in an emergency. They have in mind, and in many cases have recently been in communication with, people with previous experience who will form their staffs and, act as their representatives in the important towns in their districts,      The Instructions have, been revised and brought up to date and are ready for issue.In addition to these general arrangements three commodities have to be dealt with specially, viz:-fa)    Yeast.      A detailed scheme for the distribution of yeast has to be worked out specially on each occasion. On 30th July,  steps were taken to this end and the scheme, would &quot;have been ready to function by Tuesday, 4 th August, up to whioh date the Yeast Trade did not require assistance,(b) London- Milk Supply,      In any future emergency the Milk Trade will make its own arrangements for the supply of milk to London,.&apos;but it may be necessary for the Government to bear some portion of the extra exoonse incurred and possibly to assist the trade to obtain additional lorries. On 31st July with the authority of the President, the United Dairies were consulted and warned of the possibility thatthey
they might have to bring their Emergency Organisation into being.(Q) JfeaJAq^la Storage.      i scheme has boen vsorked out for recruiting skilled volunteer labour for the mainten-ance and operation of the principal cold stores throughout the country in the event of a strike of the engineering staff at cold storesoIf a general advance appeal for volunteers is to bo made, labour for this purpose could be earmarked (see also Mercantile Marine Department report),teneral.     Hone of the provincial officers is paid any-retaining fee, nor are any expenses (other than travelling expenses of the Headquarters &apos;jtaff) incurred in connection with the Emergency Organisation.      The whole scheme is vol-untary until the outbreak of an emergency.Details are included in the Instructions to the Divisional Pood Officers as to the means by which the Divisional Pood Staff is to be linked up with the Organisation of the other Departments in the provinces. Possible improvements -(1) If premises could be earmarked in advance as offices of the Divisional Pood Officers,, the Organisation would work more promptly in the early days of emergency,(S)  The appointment of a local. Intelligence Officer in each district to keep in constant touch with Pood Trade panels in each district would save a great deal of time and trouble at the beginning of an emergency.      These officers would be expected to compile returns of the stocks of food in each part of the district and keep such returns constantly up to date.      At present the divisional PoodOfficer
Officer is expected to secure this information after the outbreak of an emergency,Tho local Intelligence Officers would act as chief assistants to Divisional Pood Officers during the emergencyIt is estimated that the cost of Staff, Office accommodation, etc., would be  8-10,000 per annum. 3c An annual conference of Divisional Pood officers would certainly tend to improve the Organisation.      The cost of travelling and subsistence allowance would not exceed  150 for each conference.
MERCANTILE MARINE.s .Those parts, of the emergency organisation for which the Liercantila Marine Department of the Board of Trade Is primarily responsible are(A)     ^Organisation to regulate the movements of food-stuffs coastwise and the bunkering of vessels engaged on home trade services, including cross-Channel, passenger and cargo services (known as ivctor&quot;Transport District Committees)(B^     The recruiting of volunteer seamen to work ships carrying essential cargoes, esg0 food and coal end of skilled engineering staff for cold stores - (see also food report),Por the purpose of working this organisation, the whole of the United Kingdom Seaboard is divided up into 7 sections and local Committees or officials responsible for the seven sections are situated at Cardiff, Liverpool, Glasgow, Leith, Newcastle, Hull and London..   Those local officials work under the general direct!\ns of headquarter Committees in London, consisting,of representatives of the Departments concerned and the Shipping industry-..This local organisation has been maintained in nucleus forrM1 ever since   it was set up a.&apos;ter the war, and so far as (A) is concerned, nucleus Committees exist  consisting of men who have had actual experience    of the working of the emergency organisation in previous strikes.    So far as (B) is concerned, the Department&apos;s local representatives have worked out local schemes for recruiting seamen which have been examined by the Department and considered satisfactory. There hau, however; never been any occasion for this part of the organisation actually to function.All the local representatives of both (A) and (B) have been interviewed within the last two years and   revised instructions, designed to simplify the procedure or to remove difficulties which&apos;have been experienced in the past, have been distributed within the last twelve months.Iii/
In all pases care has been taken to link up these Committees and representatives with tho Emergency Organisations for. which other Departments are responsible, in order to avoid overlapping and ensure smooth working and there is every reason to think that the Mercantile Marine department s emergency organisation is as efficient as it is possible to make it, subject to the restrictions as to secrecy and expenditure imposed on the Departments concerned.None of the Provincial officials referred to is paid until the outbreak of an emergency and no expenses are incurred in normal times except small   travelling expenses for the Head-quarters staffsPOSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS III THE ORGANISATIONYJith regard to (A) no suggestions. V/ith regard to (B)  : -(l)     The personnel might perhaps be improved in some districts if a retaining fee during normal times is offered. (Estimated cost not more than  1,000 per annum),(2)     The organisation would respond more   promptly in an emergency if the organisers were allowed a comparatively small amount (say  150 in all) for travelling expenses to enable them to organise the outlying ports in advance,,(3)     If a general register of volunteers is to be kept in advance of an emergency a list of volunteers for seafaring duties could be compiled and kept up to date if the officers are paid a retaining fee.    It is suggested, however, that this is probably unnecessary and might be con-sidered inadvisable as being a provocative to the Seamen&apos;s Unio, ,(4)     If the officials are paid a retaining fee they could be required to maintain a list of people suitable and available for manning the cold stores throughout the country.y
PROCLAMATIONAn Admiralty ,-ioheme provides for the landing of naval protection parties at the following ports - London (victoria and albert Docks);    Bristol and Avonmouth Docks;    Liverpool (Brocklebahk oock) ;    Glasgow (Princes Dock);    Kewcastle-on-Tyne (Newcastle ^uay);    Hull (King George Dock);    Southampton Docks and Leith (Victoria Dock)oTliis protection, however,   could not be afforded unless resources were available after all other naval emergency requirements had been met and parties would, not be landed except -(a) On the written request of the Civil  Authorities;(b) When sufficient military or Police Forces were not available;    and(c) When adequate arrangements had been made at the places to which the menwere sent for the provision of accommodation and victuals.A further   admiralty scheme provides for operatingthe machinery at the entrances of the same docks, by meansof naval ratings subject to similar conditions in default of civilian labour.

OOMMPNI0i!ri0M3.&apos;a)    Poatal Arrangements.     Despatch Riders for the 2E 5iSLi 2S?      ^ Post Office has a sufficient number of motor cycles normally in use for the conveyance of mails to guarantee a dispatch service in the London   ,rea,  relying on volunteers from the Post Office personnel, or,  in the event of a prolongation of a strike, on volunteers obtained from the Volunteer service Organisation.(b)    Postal Arrangements Generally.     In the Railway strike in September, 1919, there was, for a tine, an almost complete cessation of the dispatch of mails between towns, but local collections and deliveries were maintained.    In the event of a railway stoppage the following action would be taken by the General Post Office:-(i) The public would be asked to refrain, as faras possible,   from the use of postal, telegraphic and telephonic services;(ii) Parcel services would be suspended,  except for local delivery;(iii) If special road services were set up by theGovernment or Local Authorities, they would be usod,  if available,  for the transport of mails and the use of private oars could probably be obtained from the A.A.If the strike extended to the Post Office personnel the services would be carried on by volunteers obtained from the public, but it would be necessary to curtail the services considerably.In addition to these arrangements a detailed scheme exiats,  for which the Air Ministry and the Home Office are responsible, for the conveyance of essential Government dispatches by air, and this service could also be used to a limited extent for the conveyance of urgent letters from the public on payment of a special fee.      The scheme provides for a daily air service between Eenly and certain provincial aerodromes, and arrangements have been made for the furtherdistribution
distribution of dispatches by road to all police headquarters, The road services would consist partly of E.A.F.  transport and partly of dispatch riders provided by the Police or the Post Office.      The H.A.P. would operate road routes in the event of the weather being unfit for flying.(Q) Jfelagraphio and Telephonic arrangements. The maintenance of efficient services depends on the transport of the manipulative staff and the maintenance of the power supply.      is regards tho former the Post Office would either arrange the necessary transport facilities or provide sleeping accommodation on the premises, and it is anticipated that, at the worst, it would be possible to maintain restricted services. As regards the power supply, with the  exception of the Central Telegraph Office, the London Trunk Exchange, and the City and Central  Telephone Exchanges, which are supplied with power from tho Post Office Power Station at Blaokfriars, nearly all the important telegraph offices and telephone exchanges depend normally on outside sources for their supply, and in  the event of the public power supply failing they could not continue working for more than two or three days.    If the  failure were only local the Post Office would use emergency charging plant (of which a large amount is distributed amongst the different engineering districts)  for the more important tolegraoh offices and telephone exchanges.    If the failure were general it would probably not be possible to maintain more than a 15$ service, but it is estimated that this would be sufficient for essential pur-poses,  i.e. Government, municipal, administrative military, police,  fire stations, doctors and hospitals. .To
lC ftwlntain a full tele graph.! c service, It would be necessary to hold, in addition to the present charging plant, an emergency supply of about 25,000 dry cellsj the capital cost of this would be about  5,000, and the manufacturers could not deliver them under about six weeks.     The question was considered by the Supply and Transport Standing Sub-Committee in November, 1923, when it was agreed that In view of the need for economy and of the fact that during a strike it would probably be essential for other purposes to keep a fair number of power stations going, this supply should not be obtained.In the event of sabotage on a large scale the wireless 3Cheme would be brought into operation.     The scheme is intended only for essential Government messages. It is baaed mainly on the broadcasting stations with assistance from the wireless service of the Navy, Army and Air Force,  and wouid provide communication between London and the principal provincial centres.     The extent to which direct communication between two provincial centres would be possible cannot at present be estimated. For the full operation of the scheme one month would be required but complete communication with nearly all the important towns could be established after 72 hours. The full capacity of the scheme is estimated at about 800 out-going messages and 1,600 in-coming messages, of average length of 14 words, per day.      It Is considered unlikely that there is any risk of the withdrawal of labour on the part of the staff of the British Broadcasting Company, but in such a contingency the services of the Senior Officers in the telegraph service would be available.
PETROLiIn the event of a strike affecting the maintenance of the very important petrol service on the Thames arrangements would be made for continuing the service with the assistance of naval ratings.The scheme prepared by the Admiralty for this purpose provides for the dispatch of a Depot Sbip to Thames Haven, to which a torpedo boat destroyer and a picket boat would be-attached for communication purposes.      A coal lighter and water tank would also be sent to Thames Haven.for coaling and watering the tugs, and the naval personnel for manning, the tugs and barges would be sent and accommodated in the Depot Ship.     24 hours are required for the ships to reach. Thames Haven and an additional 96 hours to prepare the Depot Ship for service.     Police protection would be afforded, where necessary, at the up-river depots where the petrol is dispatched from the barges.The protection of bulk petrol depots throughout the country is a matter for consideration according to circumstances as described under the heading of. &quot;Protection&quot;.     The location of the principal depots hss been notified to the Police, who have been asked to pay special attention to them so far as their resources permit.publicity/
Publicity.Arrangements would be made under the direction of the Assistant Chief Civil Commissioner for the issue of information to the Press, and. use would be made of the Broadcasting system for the purpose of giving information or making appeals to the public.Scotland.With unimportant adjustments of -machinery the emergency arrangements in Scotland are the same as in England.r^TTT^^.- ..7.........   a&apos;   &quot;   ... i 7&quot;    v .......... &apos;       &quot;...7.....&quot;-.&quot;,.7,..,/........ .

Bae Government have established machinery tf\ ensure the maintenance of essential services in the event of industrial emergencies,    JSnglnnd and Wales has for this purpose been divided into 10 Divisions and on the occurrence of a state of emergency a Civil Commissioner will be appointed to each Division. These Civil Commissi oners will be Ministers of the Crown (e.g. Parliamentary Secretaries of various Government Departments), and will be in a position to give decisions on behalf of the Government. Each Civil Commissioner will have a Chief Assistant (a General Inspector of the Ministry of Health); &amp; Finance Officer (a District Auditor of the Ministry of Health); a Pood Commissionerj a Road Commissioner; and technical advisors for other essential services according to local requirements.    In each Division there will be a number of sub-centres at which local ffinance Officers, Pood Officers, Hoad Officers and other technical assistants will be appointed.    At each of these Sub^Centres a Volunteer Service Committee for the recruiting of volunteer labour will be established, and a Haulage Committee will probably be necessary at nearly every such place, if not at all.On the occurrence of an emergency a telegram or letter will be despatched to each Chairman Of a Haulage Committee from the Ministry of Transport in the following .termB: &quot;Proceed, Transminry Parl, London&quot;.    On receipt of this communication the Chairman should take steps to form the Committee for his district by calling together representatives of the principal haulage firms etc    Trie names of the various officials in the Division with whom Haulage Committees would
&quot;be in .touch as well as a list of the names and addresses of      vi the Chairmen of Haulage Committees throughout England and wales will at the same time be sent to the Chairman of each HaulageCommittee by the Ministry of Transport.2. The general principles upon which the emergency arrangements are based is that the various local authorities willhe asked to assume responsibility for the maintenance of certain essential local services during an emergency, and that thesupply and distribution of food stuffs and other essential commodities should as far as possible be carried out under ordinalcommercial arrangements.    It is not the present intention of theGovernment to organise and operate under direct Government oontrolany schemes for the transport and distribution of essential foodstuffs etc. such as were .initiated during the Railway Strike of1919*       2he normal procedure for traders requiring transport for essential services will be to place their orders with a firm ofhaulage contractors as an ordinary business transaction.    Shouldsuch a firm be unable to meet all, the demands made upon them forroad transport for essential services application will at once bemade to.the Haulage Committee who will endeavour to arrange forthe transport to be provided from other sources.3.    Junctions of Haulage Committees,.       The functions of HaulageCommittees will be:-(i)    tho maintenance of essential transport services during the time of emergency, subject to instructions as regards priority where necessary which they will receive from the Civil Commissioner or the Divisional Sood Officer or Road Commissioner acting on his behalf.(ii)   the pooling of the available resources in road transport in their districts, both as regards vehicle&apos; and men in order that they may be used to the best advantage.(ill)   assisting the Government in securing that all existing road transport vehicles are. diverted from non- . essential to essential uses.4.     Procedure..      Hie first duty of the Haulage Committee will be to endeavour to form through information supplied by the individual members an estimate of the total number of goods-carrying vehicles in the district.    In forming such an estimate
f w f .it will probably be.well, in the first instance to ask the principal Haulage Contractors .to supply-, in confidence for the use of the Committee a list of the vehicles which they control with a note as to their normal place of garage and an indication of the vehicles, if any, which are habitually engaged (l) on the transport of foodstuffs, (2) upon work which is the subject of a running contract from which the vehicles concerned could not be diverted without the possibility of an action for damages.    This information.should be supplemented by an inquiry from those firms other than haulage contractors which possess any considerable.amount of transport for their own purposes, e.g. brewers, provision dealers, furniture removers etcIf it should be decided that the registers of the local authorities shall be made available for the information of Haulage Commit tees the necessary instructions on this point will be issued subsequently. .Having formed a rough estimate of the transport available in the district the Chairman should explain to the Committee.that during.the first few days of any strike it will probably be possible for haulage contractors to deal successfully with the demands made upon them   for the transport of essential foodstuffs and that the traders applying to tho Committee will be referred to such contractors as have indicated to the Committee that they are likely, to have.vehicles available for such purposes.The moment it becomes apparent that difficulty is being found in meeting such demands the Committee should take steps to ascertain what work ie Jaeing carried out on other than essential services, and how much of it is the subject of contract arrangements, the breach of which would possibly , expose the.contractors to an action for damages.    Members of the Committee and other responsible contractors should, then be asked to relinquish all non-essential work apart from that which is tho subject of contract,    For the provision of the remaining vehicles should these steps not prove adequate two courses will be open to the, Coimaittee, (a) to secure voluntarily
from -firms owning&apos; their own transport, other than haulage contractors, their consent to hire their vehicles out for essential transport purposes in;any cases where the Haulage Committee request them to do so; (h) to obtain such further vehicles as may be required by applying for the exercise of the Ministry of Transport requisitioning powers.5* Requisitioning Arrangements.    To meet cases which cannot!be dealt with on the ordinary commercial basis and also to oontrol transport which belongs to firms which are not engaged in the , general carrying trade but own vehicles for the purpose of their ovit businesses as well as to effect some check upon contractors whoitake advantage of the emergency to charge unreasonable rates, the Government will take powers under Emergency Regulations made under the Emergency Powers Act of 1920 to requisition vehicles or to issue directions as to the purposes for which road transport may be used.   Haulage Committees who are unable to meet demands from vehicles at their disposal or from vehicles obtained from firms engaged in non-essential trades should immediately advise the Road Officer for the district of the fact.       She Road Commissioner or Road Officer will be the only officer in the district authorised to requisition vehicles (apart from the right of the military authorities to requisition in case of absolute need for military purposes).    It is possible that in certain circumstances it may be decided to use the requisitioning powers for the sole purpose of relieving individual haulage contractors of liabilities to thin parties under contract, including the liability to be sued by the firm to whom they are under contract though in such oases it shoul^ be considered&apos;in the first place whether ah appeal to the firm to whom the vehicle is under contract to release the vehicle for the time being would be effective.    It is hoped that, even though requisitioning powers may have to be exercised, it will be possiol to make the use of the vehicles requisitioned the subject of ordinary commercial terras of hire as between the owner of the vehicle and the person whose .goods are carried.    Sailing such an arrangement, instructions will be issued to Road Officers as to the financial terms under which tho vehicles can be taken over.
- 5 7 86. Inspection of Requisitioned Vehicles..     In tlie event ofthe requisitioning of any vehicles the Road Officer, before the vehicle is requisitafoaady will arrange for.it to be inspected by a technical expert, and for a report as to its condition, spares, &quot;and equipment to be completed and signed by the owner and inspecting officer before requisition is completed;    Similarly, on handing over the vehicle after the completion of its period of requisition it will be again inspected, and the second report similarly signed by the inspecting officer on behalf of the Ministry of Transport and by the owner.7*    Priorities. &apos;; The Civil Commissioner acting through the. local Food Officer will notify to the Haulage Committee the priorities to be accorded to various foodstuffs;    and, generally speaking, it may be taken that yeast and milk, being vitally necessary and perishable commodities, would have over-riding claims to priority.       Other commodities which may be expected to stand high in the list, though their relative priority would depend upon the stocks in the particular district are flour, meat, butter, margarine, bacon and cheese, coal and petrol, but in the event of a shortage of transport and a demand for the transport of a number of these commodities, an indication as to .the respective priority amongst these commodities will be given by the appropriate Food Officer.8. Payments..      All payments in respect of transport services will so far as possible be made direct by the firm utilising the&apos;vehicles to the owners of the vehicles concerned. Ho road transport charges will normally be borne by the Government except in respect of services for which the Government is directly responsible, e.g.  the carriage of mails.    It is hoped that, even though requisitioning powers may have to be exercised it will be possible nevertheless to make the use of the vehicles requisitioned tho subject of ordinary commercial terms of hire as between the owner of the vehicle and the person whose goods are carried.    If, however,  such an arrangement is not practicable in the case of a requisitioned vehicle, a scale
Of charges will be laid down to be paid to the owners of the vehicles.    The requisitioned vehicles will normally be handed over to a Haulage Contractor who will be responsible for paying at the normal requisitioning rate to the Road Officer, The Road Officer will pay the owners at this requisitioning rate,9* Financial, Arrangements.    Chairmen of HaulageCommittees requiring to incur expenditure should apply to the Road Officer for the necessary funds and vouchers for the expenditure should be supplied to the Road Officer.10, Office Accommodation and Staff.      The arrangements foroffice accommodation and staff will depend upon local circumstances.    In some cases Chairmen of Haulage Committees may prefer to carry out tho work in their own office and with their own staff.    At many centres, thoro will bo organisations such as Chambers of Commerce or local Associations of Haulage contractors that will provide necessary accommodation and staff.     At others accommodation may be found in a Government...... - -   .Office or in the offices of the Local Authority.    Or again, it may be found convenient to have offices in close touch with the offices of other special organisations setup to deal with the emergency.    Special premises should not be hired except in special circumstances.      The local Road Officer will.advise as to suitable arrangements.       Where special office staff is required, voluntary workers will probably be available from the Volunteer Service Committee but if necessary clerical assistance may be engaged at rates which have been notified tc the local Road Officer,&apos; Out-of-pocket expenses for printing, stationery, postage,  telephones, etc. will also be refunded on application to the Road Officer.Immediately the address and telephone number of his office has been settled each Chairman of a Haulage Committee should communicate the information; to (1) Assistant Secretary, Roads Department, Ministry of Transport, London, S.W.1. (2) the local Road Officer;  (3) the local Food Officer or the
Divisional Jood Officer for the Division; (4) the Chairman of the local Volunteer Service Committee.&quot;Burden&quot; may &quot;be used by all Chairmen of Emergency Haulage Committees coupled with the name of their town as a sufficient signature to telegrams to the Headquarters of the Ministry of Transport during an emergency.    Such telegrams should be addressed to &quot;Transminry. Parl. London&quot;.11.    Incidental Expend!ture.     Chairmen of Haulage Committees will be entitled as from the date on which they receive notification to proceed with their arrangements,  to repayment of travelling expenses necessarily incurred on the business of the Committee, and in addition to sub-sistence allowances, allowances for the use of their own vehicles at the re,tes and on the conditions laid down in the instructions to Boad Officers.    It is not anticipated that travelling expenses will need to be incurred to any great extent and Chairmen are requested to observe that hired motor cars should not be used save in circumstances of exceptional urgency when no other adequate means of transport are available. In all matters involving expenditure Chairmen should act as far as possible in consultation with the local Road Officer, Daily Re-port3*       Chairmen of Haulage-Commit tees are asked to forward by post daily to the Road Commissioner of their Division, whose address will he notified, a short report indicating the degree to which they have been able to meet demands made upon them during the previous 24 hours, and mentioning any incidents of special importance from a transport point of view which have occurred.    Should any matter of a particularly urgent nature arise during the day arrangements should be made to communicate it by telephone to this officer in advance of the written report.

Once an emergency has begun they will,, as regards any particular problem arising, be regarded as responsible to the Civil Commissioner for the Division through the Road Commissioner.    They will receive any necessary instructions as to general procedure, scale of charges, rates of pay, etc. from the;Ministry of Transport,through the Road Commissioner, but the fiperation of local services, priority of conveyance and similar matters of local v^orking will be arranged locally in consultation with the Local Officers of the Department concerned with the particular service (e,g.

As explained in the Memorandum for the Use of Chairmen of Haulage Committees, it is proposed to leave the supply and distribution of food stuffs and other essential commodities to be carried out, as far as possible, under ordinary commercial arrangements.and only to resort to requisitioning when the supply of transport cannot be arranged -on a commercial-.basis.

to the Road Ubmroissioner so that the lattor may consult the Civil Commissioner as to whether in order to check the practice resort should he had to requisition or even to further powers for fixing maximum rates, etc. conferred upon the Minister by the &apos;Emergency Regulations.(6) She Road Commissioher should be consulted when localresources are found to be insufficient in order that he may consider whether other centres can be drawn upon and he shouldwhenever possible bo notified before general requisitioning is-resorted to.    This will not prevent the Road Officer in case of necessity requisitioning vehicles at once to meet urgentmilitary or other requirements, but the Road Commissioner mustbo at once informed.(7)        &apos;  &quot;  Even when requisitioning is resorted to, endeavours should be made whenever possible for the vehicle to remain Under the commercial direction of the owner., who would continue to operate it under the usual commercial arrangements - either by his own drivers or by volunteers supplied by the Volunteer Service Committee and obtain payment direct from the firm on whose behalf the vehicle is used.(8) If it is not practicable tc arrange for the owner of a requisitioned vehicle to continue to operate it under the ordinary commercial arrangements after requisitioning,  the Road Officer should arrange,&apos; If possible, with the Haulage Oommittee for the vehicle to be operated by a Haulage Contractor with his own vehicles.    In such a ease a fixed daily rate of payment according to a scale which will be communicated to the Road Officer by the Road Commissioner will be made by the Road Officer to the owner whilst the vehicle is under requisition and tho Haulage Contractor to whom the vehicle is handed.-for operation should pay at the sams &quot;rate to the Road Officer.(9) As regards requisitioned vehicles not retained byowners, nor operated by individual^haulage contractors^ the Road Officer should endeavour to arrange that the Haulage Committee should operate the vehicles on behalf of the Government.
(10)   Inspection^,All . requi si tioned vehicles should he inspected by a technical export before thoy are taken, over and a report on Form  RT. 130 should&apos;be signed by. the. Inspecting Officer and the &apos; Owner before requisition Is completed.     Similarly j whon possession is surrendered to tho Owner,  the &quot;vehicle should agai be inspected and the second report similarly signed by tho Inspecting Officer and the.Owner*    It will, therefore, bo necessary to .attach to the Road Officer one or more Inspecting Offloors..;; Inquiries should be made in the first placewhether Members of the Haulage Committees are prepared to norai members of their..staffs for this purpose.   Alternatlvely, qualified, volunteers.may bo found on. reference to the Volunteo Service Commit tea., for the Area..   Should, however, it bo necessary to pay fees, a suitable daily rate may be pa.id according to the standing of the Inspector employed.    This should in no case, exceed 2 guineas a day for each day of aetua employment on inspection work* and in the majority of cases a lower payment should suffice.(ll). The Road Officer should endeavour to secure as faas possible that requisitioned vehicles are maintained in reasonable running-repair..&apos; .(12) Requisitioned vehicles should berreleased and returned to their owners at &quot;the earliest possible opportunity. (13)     Accidents. &apos;In.tho case of&apos;accidents or damage caused to, or vehicles which are being operated on behalf. of the Government, tlae question will arisc., whether the responsibility &quot;falls upon the Government, and. accidents&apos; or damage, whether-moahanical or otherwise, or whether coming w it bin the terms of ordinary insurance Policy ox .not&apos;,&quot; as regards any such;vehicles should bo reported with the usual details to the Road Commissioner.. Further instructions as to tho procedure in -dealing with -accident claims will be diroulated.
(14)     Military Expenditure. .   Ixpenditure incurred on behalf of the Military Authorities will be chargeablo eventually te the War Office.    It will therefore he necessary to keep careful note of all such charges whether incurred in respect of requisitioned vehicles or vehicles hired;under agreements. This expenditure must &quot;be shown in a separate head in the Road Officers Account, (see para    3*)* and- should include any wages paid&apos;to drivers of vehiclee requisitioned or hired for milltarypurposes and all other charges connected therewith. (l5l I-rivera. $hereTcr possible tho ordinary driver of a requisition-od vehicle should be taken over with the vehicle.   If it is necessary specially to engage drivers for the vehicles, the Local Volunteer Service Committee should be communicated with, \7ith a view to the supply of volunteer drivers.    Should sufficient trained volunteers not be available, it might be necessary to engage and train drivers, who should be paid during the period of training and employment at the local rates of labour for that class, including the usually recognised allowance (not exceeding 7/6d, a night) for each night1 s absence from home.    The Manager of the local Employment Exchange will if necessary advise as to the agreed local rate of pay and conditions.    Should training become necessary, detailed Instructions will be issued as to the steps to be taken. (l6) Owner drivers who offer their cars ormotorcycles free-of charge for public.service may be reimbursed the cost of petrol necessarily used.If light cars and motor cycles offered on this basis are insufficient for essential requirements, payments for their use can be made up to certain maxima which can be obtained from tho Road Commissioner.(I?)  re.^scS&quot;     In the majority of cases, Road Officerscan no doubt arrange for accommodation to bo provided by the Local Authority.    If it is necessary to rent premises- specially Road Officers should act in&apos;conjunction with Lbcal Officers., of H.,M. Office of Works.    Premises should bo taken en the shortest possible term.    If possible iiae officer should inspect the promisejs with representatives of the Owners&apos;and&apos;note their
condition, (1 ) when possession is., taken j   and (ii) when possession is relinquished.&quot;Ihv such cases the Road Officer .*is- alfco -authorised   &apos; to horror/ or hire nocoseary furniturov/hich should ho hired at tho oheapest&apos; rates ohtainablc - having&apos;&quot;regard; to * the probable period, for which it will-ho&apos; required. -; -;.-       -  .

(19).      Staff.      The arrangements for staff will depend upon circumstances.   In somo casos Road Officers will be able to arrange for the assistance of the staff of the Local Authority, Where special office staff is required volunteer workers should be obtained if possible from the Volunteer Service Commit-too. If it is necessary to engage paid: staff the, foil owing maximum rates should be observed, but *overy* endeavour should bo used to secure staff at rates below the maximum:-&apos;.....-   Halo per week,    gemale vev woe.Supervisory.  3* 15.0,..   ; . 2. 2.5. 0.Routine. ---    3.    ov 0. , 20   0. 0.Shorthand Typist,  3.    0.- 0, -a^ jo, 0.Typist, &quot; -  2, 10.  0.     .,  2.    0. 0,Mossengors (adult), -  &apos;   2, 10, 0,  1, 10, 0,w (other than adult)  1,   0, p., , .  1.   0, 0.Preference in employment should be given to Sx-Service men.Appointments should be toraihable at      hours1 notice on either side.

ItHIS POOUMBK^IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS HRITAHHIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEaWMBHT)vCAB 1MB T. supply AND TRANSPORT Cp^gTTSK. TRANSPORT ARiiaNQEfeiENTS IN AM EXIGENCY.Efemoranduta by the Minister of Transport;*I am satisfied that in the recent Emergency the Transport arrangements for which I was responsible had been brought as far forward as was possible under tho instructions existing at the time.If the Emergency had gone on we should have had in place on Saturday, Road Commissioners in each of the 11 Divisions, together with Haulage Committees numbering over 80 at various&apos; centres Including the Divisional Headquarters.     We alec had ready the name of the Road Transport Officer who should be approached to act In each of those centres.     If we had been allowed te despatch the telegram on Friday night all those officers would have been approached on Saturday and the great majority of them would undoubtedly have consented while the places of the others could easily have been filled.At the same time I have frequently expressed the view In the Supply and Transport Committee that under the existing Instructions about publicity it was impossible to proceed far with the Emergency arrangements of- Transport and I suggest that the position In this fespe*t has been radically altered by the attitude of the Trades Unions announcing publicly In advanceIfthat they were prepared to use every effort to stop Transport and paralyse the community Ih connection with a strike in another trade.     This threat would, T think, from every point of -view justify far more complete preparation and I would euggest that the Emergency organisation should now be perfected as thwugh an emergency had occurred.     V7ithout making any public announcement of any steps we should proceed straight ahead with
all possible plane.     We should act confidentially and aek those who were approached to treat the matter as confidential, but at the same time we should not be deterred by a risk of possible or probable leakage from taking any atepe.I do not. however, wieh to lay too much stress upon the preparations which can be made by the Government in advance. X am confident that within two days of a strike on this last or on any future occasion we should have the machine in working order because the goodwill evoked by an Emergency enables things to be done rapidly, especially when Headquartera have carefully thought out what they propose to do and have all the Staff arrangements for doing It ready.     X should like to point out that apart from any effort on the part of the Government private enterprise would in innumerable directions have started Emergency services, the development of which would have depended entirely on the degree of protection that could have been afforded.     X feel, however, that an organisation outside the Government could do a very great deal In enrolling in advance capable and willing volunteers and giving them Instructions where to report and for what duties *    Such menv twould not be deterred by the intimidation of pickets and would begin to get the machinery both of the Railways and Road Transport working with the result that regular workers would be encouraged to stay on or return.     if such volunteers were ready and could be protected, I think we could face with reasonable confidence a complete Transport strike.     Protection Is, however, the essence of the problem and It must be realised that Railways in particular, but transport in general, are very vulnerable.(Intld.)     tf.A.6th August, J9gS.
