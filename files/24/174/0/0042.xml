OONFIDENTIAL&apos;LIBRARY dWjDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI a BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CABINET.Rates of Great War Pension.I submit the following memorandum for the decision of the Cabinet.1.        The question of possible reduction   in the rates of great War Pensions has been an issue at the last three general elections, and was raised prominently at the recent bye-elections.     I was empowered to announce on the 11th ultimo that existing rates would be maintained for a further year, i.e. until March, 1927, and, further, that it Was the intention of the Government &quot;To consider at the earliest possible moment an equitable measure of stabilisation for a longer period&quot;.     It is evident however, (from the many questions addressed to me in the House and from other sources) that the uncertainty as to the future of pension rates is being assumed to cover an intention to reduce those rates and will be so used by the Opposition in their Autumn campaign.I regard it as of &amp;   first importance that this question of Great War Pension rates should cease to be a recurrent political issue, and I think a reasonable measure of stabilisation is now practicable.2*        Rates of Pensions in force since. 1919.     The rates of pension and of other benefits under the Great War Warrants were substantially increased by the Royal Warrant of 1919 to meet an increased cost of living represented by the index figure of 215 (the  pre-war cost being taken as 100).     Subject to a Zk year period, that is to Maroh 1923, during which they were to remain unaltered, the rates of pension were, by the terms of the Warrant, made liable to alteration, up or down, annually to follow the index figure of the cost of living as certified by the Minister of Labour for the preceding year, with the proviso that no change in the rates should be made unless the cost of living showed a variation of at least five points.     In November 1922 (shortly before the first change in the rates was due to take place) the Government decided that it would be equitable to maintain the existing rates for a further three years, that is, until March 1926, on the two-fold ground that (a) the cost of living had risen against the pensioner during 1920 and 1921 (whereby he had lost on balance during the stabilisation period of 3- - yeara): and (b) stability of prices was not yet within sight.3.        The Government gave a pledge at the last General Election that they would   be opposed to any reduction of existing rates of pension under  present conditions&quot;, and, temporarily, effect has been given to this pledge by the latest decision, to whioh I have already referred, that existing rates would be maintained for a further year, i.e., until March 1927.4.        Any measure of stabilisation for a longer period Is, of course, dependent upon some provisional forecast of future conditions as affecting the cost of living.      I have made enquiries of the experts of other Departments, including the Treasury, on this point, and it is their view that, so far as can be judged from all the known factors, &quot;present conditions&quot; as regards the cost of living are not likely, in thea pproximately
approximately near future, to be materially affected in favour of the consumer;    if anything, there may be a   slight tendency to a rise in the cost of living.     Moreover, even if the average annual index figure should remain in the neighbourhood of the present average (i,e,, 175) the wide margin of fluctuation of prices month by month, which has marked the post war period by comparison with the pre war is likely to be maintained.    In the circumstances, there is, I think,  justification for an announcement on the part of the Government that existing rates will be maintained for a longer period than the one year which haB just been announced.5. I do not advise (at any rate for the present) that existing rates should be stabilised in perpetuity;    partly on the ground that It would not be reasonable to commit the Exchequer of the future to the maintenance of rates which might, by some wholly unforeseen fall in prices, become manifestly unfair to the taxpayer, but mainly because to do so would be to   give colour to the suggestion (already apparent in some quarters), that the existing rates should be regarded as a minimum instead of being, as they virtually are, a maximum. The latter reason is important to the extent that there is some possibility of an Increase in the cost of living in the future. On the other hand, to fix the present rates for a precise period of three years or any other period, as has been done in the past, would be merely to leave the issue to become a periodic political question.6.        I propose, therefore, while preserving the relationship between the present rates of pension and the cost of living, to secure the maximum stability   for the existing rates by prescribing that they shall not be varied so long as the average cost of living falls somewhere between a maximum and a minimum point.     The maximum point is already fixed by the Warrant as that of the cost of living in the year 1919, viz., 215.       The minimum figure which, after consultation with the Treasury, I propose to adopt would be 160.     So long as the average cost of living did not fall below this minimum no reduction in the rates of pension would be made.     At the same time, in order to secure the practical advantages of stability of rates for a reasonable period ahead, I propose to make any change, either up or down, In the rates of pension, dependent upon a three years average of the cost of living, instead of a one year average as proVioid by the present Warrant,     The three year average should, I think, be brought into operation not earlier than 1929, i.e., three years from the end of the period for which the rates were for- the last time unconditionally fixed (see paragraph 2).      This will provide a settlement of the question for at least, three years ahead, and,  with practioal certainty, for a good deal longer.7. I recognise that this (or Indeed any other scheme)of stabilising existing pension rates for a prolonged period means virtually the sacrifice by the Exchequer of a substantial saving which would amount at the present time to about  6s500,000.     I think, therefore, that there are two conditions which properly attach to my proposal *The
The first is that this scheme of stabilising the present high rates of pension and of other benefits under the Warrant applies only to those classes of beneficiary for which the Warrants already provide.     Proposals have been made (as the Cabinet are aware) for abolishing the various time limits and other conditions of the Warrants, Acts and Regulations affecting the present scheme of compensation for Great War disability or death.     There is no intention of acceding to these proposals, as was, Indeed, decided by the Cabinet Committee appointed in May last. If, however, the State should hereafter, in some unforeseen circumstances, be forced to Increase its liability by far-reaching amendments to the Warrants, which would have the effect of importing fresh classes of beneficiary, the Government of the day must clearly be free to re-consider the rates of pension.8.        In the second place, while I am satisfied that there can be no question of reducing the rates of pension provided by the Warrants, questions have been raised as to the advisability of continuing the present rates of the special allowances payable to disabled men during a course of medical or surgical treatment.     I am aware that tho3e rates are relatively high, and that the terms of the Warrant embodying them involve difficulties for the Ministry.     But the difficulties are administrative and, after full consideration, I am satisfied that no mere reduction In the rate of this benefit within the terms of the present Warrant (I.e. by the fall in the cost of living) would remove them.     The broad fact is that the class of case which calls for medical treatment from the Ministry is changing from the temporary case into the chronic.     I think It possible that provision may have to be made for the latter class of case on different lines from those properly applicable to the former class, which alone was contemplated when the Royal Warrant was drawn up.     In stabilising existing rates, so far as they are affected by the operation of the present sliding scale, I would reserve the question of further consideration of the substantive provisions of the Warrant in respect of these allowances so far as circumstances may show any change to be necessary.9. I propose, therefore, with the consent of theCabinet, to make the following announcement in the House at a suitably early date:-&quot;The Government have carefully considered in the interests of pensioners the practicability of a settlement of pension rates for a longer period than for the year to March, 1927, already announced.A3 the House is aware, pensions for the Great War were, on the advice of a Select Committee of this House, brought into definite relationship to the cost of living. They were increased to their present rates in 1919 on the basis of an increased cost of living represented by the index figure of 115$ in excess of the pre-war cost.     After an initial period of 3&amp; years ending in March, 1923, which was for special reasons subsequently extended for a further three
throe years to March, 1926, they were, by the terras of the Royal Warrant, made to vary up or down if the average coat of living changed by at least 5 per cent.     That cost does, in fact, now show a substantial decline from the figure of 1919, and if the rates of pension were reduced proportionately the annual cost of pensions would be lower by approximately 6-g million pounds.It has, however, always been the view of the Government that the operation of the Warrant in regard to rates should, In the interests of pensioners, be conditional on a reasonable stability being reached in the cost of living and the Government long ago Intimated that under present conditions they were not in favour of a reduction of rates. When all the known factors are taken into account it is clear that the conditions necessary to stability of the cost of living have, unfortunately, not yet been reached, nor are they within sight in the near future.     While, therefore, a settlement of the rates In perpetuity is not at present attainable consistently with the interests of all parties concerned, the Government have come to the conclusion, after full consideration of all the known factors affecting tho . matter, that, while maintaining the present relationship of pension rates to the cost&quot;of living, a substantially larger measure of security can reasonably be given to the pensioner than has already been announced.The Government have, therefore, decided that, as regards the operation of Article 24 (a) of the Royal Warrant on the rates of pension, and other allowances for the classes of beneficiary provided for by the Royal Warrant and subject to the present terms of the Warrants, and the War Pensions Acts, no change in the present rates shall be made so long as the average cost of living, as certified by the Minister of Labour, falls somewhere between a given maximum and minimum figure.     The minimum figure for this purpose will be 60 peroent. in excess of the pre-war cost of living, while the maximum is that already provided by the Warrant, viz: the cost of living in the year 1919.With a view to giving still further security to the pensioner, the average cost of living will be, not the annual average originally prescribed by the Royal Warrant, but an average over three years, and the average will not in any case operate before 1929.     The effect of this settlement will be to give stability to the present rates for at the very least three years from 31 at March, 1926, and from all present indications for an even longer period,&quot;G.C TRYON.
