-   &apos; QSNFir-MTiAL UBRMfc.- .392(THIS document IS THE PBOPEBTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Copy No.    JaaHS^J.0^. 358(25)..IMPERIAL WAR G-RAVES COMMISSION. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.      The principle of accumulating a capital sum sufficientto provide the annual income necessary to defray in per-petuity the cost of maintenance of war graves has alreadybeen approved by the Cabinet.    The questions of the rate and method of accumulation of the Endowment Fund were left for later consideration after examination by me.    (Cab. 15(25) Jonclusion 7 and Cab. 19(25) Conclusion 5). ,;2.     As regards the rate of accumulation I have had dis-discussion with the Secretary of State for War as Chairman ofthe Imperial War Graves Commission and have reached agree-ment with him on the following basis.In addition to such provision as may be agreed to benecessary in each year in respect of maintenance and con-reconstruotion charges, the Imperial Parliament shall be askedto vote the following sums which shall be vested in Trustees(hereafter to he appointed) of an Endowment-Fund for thepermanent maintenance of v;/ar Graves viz:1925  50,0001986  50,0001927  50,0001928 ^125,0001929  125,000 1930 and each subse-quent year  300,000 until the oapital sum.reaches the British share--(81.52 per oentJ of the total figure of  5,000,000.
The Dominion and other Governments concerned will contribute,  either proportionately with the above or in such instalments as may be more convenient to them, their respective proportions of the total.3.      I have considered the suggestions made at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, April 1st,  that the Endowment Fund should be constituted by statute.    I am advised, however, that legislation other than the Appropriation Act will not be necessary and that the requisite provision oan be made annually by Vote of Parliament.    On the other hand it is clearly necessary that the attention of Parliament should be drawn to the Government&apos;s intentions and the authority of Parliament obtained for the course proposed, if only to safeguard the future position;    and this can bs done by discussion on the Supplementary Estimate for the  50,000 which it is proposed to set aside this year and pay over t.. tho Trustees of the Endowment Pund. 4.      I invite my colleagues to concur in the above proposals.Treasury Chambers,  S.VV.1, 20th July,  1925.
