CONFIDENTiAL LIBRARY.    353(This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CABINET.- 3 a judicial PRO GEE DINGS  (REGULATION OB&apos; REPORTS) BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.tI circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum - CP.  163(25) -on the subject of Lord Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill, which was introduced in the House of Commons;    and on the 25th March the Cabinet I decided  (Cabinet Conclusions 18(25))   (1)  to encourage a petitionfrom Members of Parliament and  (2) that I should see representatives of the Press.    Lord Evelyn Cecil immediately forwarded to the Prime Minister a petition signed by about 200 Members urging the Government to grant facilities for the Bill.I had a private conference with representatives of the Press and put the position before them.    I pointed out that the Select Committee of 1923 had heard all the arguments that could be advanced against the Bill but - nevertheless reported in its favour, that the Bill was hacked by Members of all Parties,  and that 200 Members had petitioned for facilities for it.    I said that various I        minor objections to details in the    Bill Could be met by amendments, and I asked for the help of the newspaper representatives.    Some of them I gathered would be prepared to accept a Bill limiting reports on divorce proceedings only, and I suggested that if some measure of agreement could be reached,  I would be prepared to ask the Lord Chancellor to meet the  Judges with a view to considering whether the Judges could take more frequently than they do at present the responsibility of indicating to the reporters in oases other than divorce oases what should not be reported.The suggestion was made by one of the Press representatives that the conference might be adjourned so that the members of the Press Organisations might meet together and consider whether they could bring forward some concrete suggestions.    I accepted this
-2-proposal gratefully^ but I have heard nothing further since the date of this conference (which was on the 7th April) and I have little hope of obtaining any helpful suggestions from the Press representatives.Lord Darling is introducing today in the House of Lords a Bill which is understood to be in the same terms       Lord Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill, and it is down for Second Reading on Thursday, the 16th.I understand a proposal will be made to refer this.Bill to a Select Committee, and I suggest that the Government should accept this proposal.    Although the present Bill is based on the Report of the Select Committee of 1923,  the need for certain amendments has been pointed out and the Select Committee could consider these amendments,  as well as hearing again the general objections urged by the Press.It will be remembered that on the 9th June the Prime minister stated in reply to a Question that he could not make any statement as to facilities for Sir Evelyn Cecil&apos;s Bill, but he could give an assurance that the question -was under consideration by theGovernments    On the Second Reading of Lord Darling1s Bill theGovernment spokesman might say that the Government have given thematter careful consideration,  that they are impressed by&quot; thevolume of opinion in favour of the general principle of the Bill,that they have also been impressed by various difficulties and suggestions for amendments which have been put before them,  andIthat they have come to the conclusion that further consideration by another Select Committee would be useful.1 I p11:.&apos;.
