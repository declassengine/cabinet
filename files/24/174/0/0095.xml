The contractors may be expected to bring with them their own permanent men up to 20% of the total required.     There will thus remain 500 men to be found.      The Air Ministry are not in a position to do more than make a guess at the number of agricultural labourers who would be engaged, if there were no restriction, but they estimate the number at 120, approximately one-third of the whole number.     Work has already begun on part of the job at Bicester and Suttons Farm on contracts let without any restrictive clause as to recruitment of labour, perhaps 12 to 15 unskilled-labourers being already employed at each place.Price.

This representson  850,000 ft he estimated cost of the 4 v/orlaS immediately in prospect)  46^750; &quot;but the increase may he expected to vary considerably with the circumstances of each aerodrome0     At Suttona Farm, for instance, which is only 5 miles from Homford it is not expected that a marked difference of price will result Tenders for this contract on an alternative basis will be opened at IS noon on the 13th instant.The arguments in favour of requiring Contractors to draw their unskilled labour from the nearest Employment Exchange (with the exception of their regular employees) are understood to be(l) that the interests of farmers will be adversely affected if permanent agricultural labourers are drawn by higher wages on 10 the works(2) that it would be a useful test of the willingness to work of unemployed men in industrial centres if&apos; jobs could be offered them on these aerodromes.The Ministry of Labour do not, however,  think it would be possible to make any extensive use of this work as a test and do not suggest that it would be worth paying a substantially higher price for the aerodromes to gain this advantage..The question therefore really turns on (1).igrlcultural All four works in question will be begun in the late-ahour *autumn, or early winter.    There will at that time be floating agricultural labour unemployed.    If such men, as will probably be the case, are registered as unemployed, it will not in any event be possible to exclude them from employment on tho aero-dromes, even if they would not return to farm work in the early syringe      It seems likely therefore that even if the
es5 ^condition   1 ere imposed, it would only have partial effect.The problem,, therefore,  is confined to the agricultural labourers in permanent employment who may be tempted to throw up their employment in order to take better paid work on the aerodromes.    The &quot;Conference suggests that if contractors are to be prevented from employing: such men, a clause could be Inserted in the contracts requiring the contractor not to take on a man last employed in agriculture without the consent of the Enployment Exchange.      The farmer could thus be protected against the loss of his permanent labour,      But the principle involved is one of no small importances  for its effect would be to prevent the low paid labourer in a permanent job from obtaining other employment at higher wages.     We feel bound to point  out that a condition such as is suggested, being a direct embargo on the employment of agricultural labour, would lend itself to criticism, and the question whether on grounds of general policy it is one which it is necessary or advisable to adopt will no. doubt be considered by the Cabinet...Without the experience which will be available after alternative tenders have been received, it is not possible to give any estimate of the increase in price which weuld be involved if oontractcrs were reqiiired to accept such a clause.. Each case would have to be separately dealt with but the addition to the price which the  contractor would be  justified in making would be much less if the clause were limited as suggested than if the contractor were to be required to recruit all his labour thfough the Employment Exchanges.Treasury Chambers, S*W., 12th August, 1925.
