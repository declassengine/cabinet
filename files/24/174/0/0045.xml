THT3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.The Committee appointed under the Safeguarding of Industries Procedure to consider the application of the Act with respect to Leather and Fabric Gloves have reported in favour of the applicants and recommend the Imposition of afabric gloves.     In a covering letter, the Chairman points out that, as some considerable time must elapse before the duty can be imposed, should the Government decide to adopt the recommendation, it is desirable that either (1) the publication of the report should be deferred until just before the requisite legislation is introducedor (2) the duty should be imposed retrospectively onall imports since the date of the publication of the report.Otherwise it is possible that importers and foreign manufacturers may accumulate in this country stocks so large as to delay seriously, if they do not entirely defeat, the object of the duty.     That this may happen is apparent not only from recent experience in respect of the new duties imposed by this year&apos;s Finance Act, but also from experience in respect of duties imposed under Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921.As regard the first alternative,  the suggestion means in effect that at whatever date a Committee might report, its findings would not be made public until the eve of the Introduction of a Finance Bill, that is to say, that theCP. 346  (25)C A B I NET.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.PUBLICATION   OF   REPORTS.duty of 33  per cent, ad valorem on Imported leather and
reports of Committees would be held up and only issued say-twice a year (assuming that there would be a special Autumn Finance Bill).     Clearly reports which were adverse to applicants would have to be held up in the same way as reports **  favourable to them.     If adverse reports were issued there would be an obvious assumption that the unissued reports were favourable to applicants and therefore that duties were probable.     Even if all reports favourable or adverse are held up, a flood of imports may still take place.     It will be generally known when the Committee has finished Its hearingj   and this in itself may be a sufficient warning to importers to lay in a store of imports in anticipation of a possible duty.     But the holding up of reports may do some good:   and it Is a precaution which I think we ought to take.It will no doubt be said in criticism of this course that it may prolong the period of uncertainty in any trade, which may be embarrassing for those engaged in it.      In some cases this would be more serious than in other cases.       But, on the other side, It could be argued that uncertainty begins as a*oon as it is known that an application has been made and that 2 or 3 months prolongation of the period could not therefore make any great difference in the majority of cases at any. rate .     Also there Is the chance of leakage of the findings of the Committees, which is another disadvantage.The second alternative would mean a very definite departure from constitutional practice and also presents very considerable difficulties of a practical nature.     The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1913,   (commonly known as &quot;the Bowles Act&quot;) gives statutory effect for a limited period to Resolutions varying or renewing taxation, but does not apply to new taxes.      I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has under consideration the question of an
amendment of the law so as to allow of the collection of new taxes from the date of the Resolution; but that involves only a period of a few weeks, whereas the present proposal relates to a period of possibly some months.     It would scarcely be possible to give the Customs power to collect duties os from the date at which the Government announced its intention   to introduce legislation to give effect to the findings of the Committee, unless the amount and scope of the duties were very clearly specified and no substantial changes were made therein by the subsequent legislation.     This comment applies to some extent to the collection of duties from the date of the Resolution. For example, as it was clearly impossible to consult more than a very limited number of advisers, the duties imposed on Silk by the Resolution were necessarily maximum duties and very provisional;   they were entirely recast as the result of discussion in the House of Commons and with all the ^rade interests affected, and if the Customs had collected the duties set out in the Resolution for the two months which elapsed between the date of the Resolution and the coming into operation of the Finance Act, there would have been chaos.    Of course, there are no doubt cases where such difficulties would not arise,- Gloves are probably an instance of this,- but more complex cases must be borne in mind.    It is true that in certain countries duties are imposed by a Decree and their collection commences in anticipation of legislation, but these are countries with general and not selective tariffs.An alternative to the actual collection of duties in anticipation of legislation would be for the Customs to keep records of importations and to do their best to collect the duty in arrear after the legislation had passed imposing the duties.    Here again difficulties would arise
*j     xif for example the schedule of articles to be taxed under-went changes in the House;    in such cases the records in many cases might prove useless for duty purposes.Incidentally it may be pointed out that this or any other method under which the importer does not actually pay duty until the necessary legislation has been passed puts him in s somewhat advantageous position; to protect himself he will put up his prices to his customers forthwith and will be collecting from them in   -respect of the duty monies which he will not have to pay over till a considerably later date with consequent financial benefit to himself;    and if anything should happen to prevent the eventual imposition of the duties all the extra he received would be sheer   gain,I think on the whole that the most effective safeguard we can devise in practice is to withhold the publication of reports till shortly before the introduction of the financial resolution, and to obtain power to impose the duty as from the date of the Resolution.I should be inclined, however, a a an exception to this new rule to publish the Superphosphate report.    It   could be stated that the reason for this exception was that the report had already been considered by the Cabinet which has resolved not to impose a duty.If this exception is not made I fear that trouble willbe met with both from the farming interests and those who servethem.    I am told that the &quot;Fertiliser year&quot; ends on the 30thJune;   that in July and early August contracts are being made and manufacturers knowing those contracts make out their manu-facturing plan so as to deliver in time for agricultural useat the proper season.   At present all the interests concernedthatare asking that the report may be issued and^they may know the Government intentions at the earliest&apos; possible time, since
Board of Trade.the uncertainty is holding the Trade up and upsetting the farmers.It will be necessary to announce o\ir policy as to publication generally at an early date.P.C-L. 13.7.25.
