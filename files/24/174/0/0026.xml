CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,[This Document is the Property of His Britarenic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; 1 &apos;Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1925.SECRET.C.O.S. 19 (Revised).(Also C.I.D. No. 617-B (Revised).)Copy No.     60COMMITTEE   OF  IMPERIAL  defence.CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.Situation in China.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.THE Committee of Imperial Defence, at its 200th Meeting, held on the 22nd June, 1925, invited the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to examine the possibility of despatching reinforcements to China, should the necessity arise. The Sub-Committee met on Tuesday, the 23rd June, and secured the assistance of Mr. Waterlow, of the Far Eastern Department, Foreign Office, and General Sir A. Cobbe, Secretary, Military Department, India Office. Subsequently a Joint Note was prepared by the Naval, Genera] and Air Staffs, which contains a full appreciation of the present position and is concurred in by the Chiefs of Staffs. We circulate the Joint Note as the annexure to this Report.British Forces in the Far East.2. The British forces now in the Far East are as follows : Naval Forces. The Far . Eastern Squadron, including certain river gunboatswhich have been brought forward from reserve. Military Forces. One British battalion in North. China, distributed between Tientsin and the Tientsin-Pekin Railway.One British battalion and one Indian battalion at Hong Kong, together with certain batteries and other xmits for the local defence of that place. Singapore : one British battalion and certain coast-defence units. Air Forces. Nil[For further details see the Appendices and annexure to this Report.]3. In 1914, notwithstanding that the general political situation in China was much better than at present, there were three battalions in North China, three at Hong Kong and one in Ceylon which could have been moved to the Far East in an emergency. The reduction to the present figure was arranged in 1921-22 as a result of the Report of the Geddes Committee on National Economy, when the curtailment of expenditure on the Services was considered of paramount importance.4. In present conditions no troops can be spared either from Singapore, where there is a large Chinese population, or from Hong Kong, where the situation is menacing. In fact, it is by no means improbable that a request may be received before long from Hong Kong for a reinforcement of the garrison.5. Hence, to meet an emergency, the nearest place from which reinforcements.can be drawn is India.British Interests in China.6. We are informed that, in the view of the Foreign Office, the British interests in China, which have had to be considered, can be examined under four heads : (i.) North China. Pehin, where the Legations might be threatened:Tientsin : The Tientsin-Pekin Railway, which is protected by an international force under the 1901 Protocol ; and the propertj^ of the Kailan Mining Administration.[13268 a! b
(ii.) Treaty Ports. Where there are foreign concessions and other interests, (hi.) Inland. Where there are British commercial interests, missionaries and otherindividuals whose lives and property m&apos;3y&quot;&apos;be threatened, (iv.) Canton. AVhich is now largely under Bolshevist control and might possiblydevelop into a serious menace to British interests and prestige in the far east.North China.7. As regards (i), the situation against which provision would have to be made is not unlike that which arose in 1899 at the time of the Boxer rebellion. It will be remembered that at that time an international relief force of some 2,00(J men, under the command of Admiral Sir E. Seymour, started from Taku to relieve the Legations at Pekin, but was compelled to fall back upon Tientsin pending the assembly there of a larger international relief force.8. If similar trouble should arise at the present time, adequate protection could not be given in time by British forces. The battalion at Tientsin is required to assist in keeping open the railway. As already indicated, no troops can be spared from Hong-Kong or Singapore, and it is calculated that a force of one brigade from India could not arrive at Taku until about five weeks after the issue of the order, and this estimate corresponds closely with the time actually taken in 1899, when an Indian contingent was despatched to Taku at the time of the Boxer rebellion.9. We have considered whether any advantage would be obtained by sending a preliminary warning to the Government of India, so as to enable arrangements to he made for a rapid despatch of troops. Such a warning, however, would not result in a saving of more than one or, at the most, two days, since in India shipping is the limiting factor and the troops can be ready for embarkation as soon as the necessary sea transport can be rendered available.* Moreover, it would be difficult to keep secret any preliminary warning, and the Foreign Office would deprecate any leakage of information regarding preparations for the possible despatch of reinforcements to the Far East. In these circumstances we recommend that no advance warning should be given. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, however, is in touch on the subject with the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India, who is now in this country, and has warned him in regard to the present situation.10. Consequently, in the contingency of a threat to, or an attack on, British interests in Pekin or Tientsin, we should have to rely on international action. There has been a tendency in China to isolate Great Britain and to direct public resentment mainly against this country. Nevertheless, it seems more probable that, if serious trouble arises, the interests of all the. Western European Powers and of the United States of America will be equally in danger.11. We attach to this Report particulars of the international forces in North China (Appendix I). If further reinforcements were required, Japan.is the only country in a position to furnish them rapidly. As already indicated, however, these could he reinforced at Taku within a period of five weeks by a brigade from India.The Treaty Ports.12. A considerable degree of protection is already being given to British and other foreign concessions and interests in the Treaty Ports (see Appendix II) by the British and other foreign naval forces in the Far East. The disposition of His Majesty&apos;s ships on the 2&apos;.ith June, 1925, is given in the annexure to this Report. No other means are available for affording protection. The Foreign Office are informed of the position of His Majesty&apos;s ships and can make suggestions as to where they would wish these to be moved, but, generally speaking, the disposition of the naval forces can best be left to the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the Station, who is in communication with the diplomatic and consular authorities.British Interests Inland.13. Naval forces can afford no protection except on the coast or in the navigable portions of the rivers of China. We are accordingly of opinion that the missionaries and other isolated individuals, if exposed to danger, should be withdrawn to ports and other places where they can receive the benefit of naval protection, if this has not already been done.* This has been confirmed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in India (Field-Marshal Sir Birdwood), who has been in communication unofficially on this subject with the O.I.G.S.
[13268 a]* Also O.I.D. 248-C.14. We desire to draw attention to tiie bearing of recent events on the provision of modern gun-boats for use on the rivers of China, which has been recommended by the Foreign Office and is under consideration elsewhere. It is only by means of these vessels that adequate protection can be provided.Canton.i5. We are informed by the Foreign Office that the present disturbance in China is a symptom of a large-scale nationalist movement directed against the positions of foreign Powers, particularly this country, and fomented and exploited by the Soviet Government, which is making systematic use of the opportunity to injure vital British interests in a part of the world where they are most vulnerable. One of the centres of Bolshevist control in China in the future is likely to be at Canton, where there is already a military school which shows signs of considerable efficiency. This school has been financed to a large extent by Soviet agents in Canton, and has been assisted in other ways by the Soviet Government. Accordingly, in the view of the Foreign Office, the situation may develop in such a way that it may become desirable for Great Britain to take some action to counteract these Soviet activities.16. At first sight it would appear that the easiest way to strike a blow at Canton would be by means of Air forces based on Hong-Kong. The matter, however, presents considerable difficulties. There is considerable doubt as to whether the construction of an Air base at Hong-Kong is permissible under the terms of article 19 of the Washington Treaty on Limitation of Armament, a question which forms the subject of a separate report (Paper No. C.O.S.-20).*Apart from this question, however, great difficulty and expense would be involved in the provision of an aerodrome owing to the absence of any suitable site. In an emergency, bombing machines would have to work from carriers, and the only aircraft which could make use of Hong-Kong itself would be single-seater fighters working from the recreation ground in Happy Valley, where an aerodrome might be improvised, though not without difficulty. Until a carrier has arrived on the China station no action could be taken by air against Canton.Putting aside the question of aerial action, the question of offensive action against Canton is a part of the general question of military operations against China.Offensive Action.17. On this wider question we invite the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the Joint Note by the Staffs (see annexure to this Report), the Conclusions of which are stated in the following extract: &quot; From the naval and military point of view, it is essential to realise that offensive action on a large scale is not possible in China for the British Empire acting alone. China is a vast country offering no decisive military objective. Given time for preparation, the necessary troops and the acquiescence of the other foreign Powers, it might be possible to capture Pekin, Canton or one of the great towns near the coast. These could be held to ransom or destroyed, or temporarily occupied. But that is the limit of the possibilities of offensive military action, which, amounts to no more than a programme of raids. No finality is to be hoped for from it. The force required in most cases would be considerable, varying from one to two or more divisions.&quot; Offensive action in China on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.&quot;Reserve for the Far East.18. From the above report it will be seen that no reserve British military force which could be made available for the protection of British interests in China exists nearer than India, and that five weeks would elapse before an Indian force could be landed at Taku. We gather that in the view of the Foreign Office our military strength in these regions is in no way commensurate with the importance of British prestige and interests in China. From the table in Appendix I it will be seen that both France and the United States of America maintain larger forces in North China than Great Britain. The need for an increase in the strength both of our Naval Forces on the China Station and of the garrison of Hong Kong is emphasised in the Joint Note by the Staffs (see annexure to this Report), where it is pointed out that
&quot;the military significance of the present unrest lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the future than in any present danger.&quot; We feel bound to invite the earnest attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to this consideration, and to the extent of our dependence on foreign, and particularly on Japanese, assistance for the protection of British interests in China in case of emergency.19. We consider that our military forces in the Far East should be increased so as to provide&quot; a small reinforcement in case of emergency, such as that with which we may any day be confronted. This reinforcement, we suggest, should consist, as a minimum, of an additional British and an additional Indian battalion at Hong-Kong.t 20. For the additional Indian infantry battalion there will be available certain Indian huts, which could be made fit for habitation at a small cost.21. No accommodation exists for an additional British battalion. We suggest, however, that the important British companies with extensive interests in China, who rely on us for military protection, some of which,.we understand, do not pay British income tax, might be expected to contribute in some way to the cost of housing an additional British battalion at Hong-Kong.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.22. (a.) The military significance of the present unrest in China lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the future than in any present danger.(b.) In the event of threats to or attacks on the Legation or other British interests in Pekin or Tientsin, no British military force other than the one battalion at Tientsin is available. The first reinforcement which could arrive would be one brigade from India ; this could reach Taku in about five weeks from the date of the order to mobilise. During this period of five weeks reliance would have to be placed on international action.(c.) British interests in the Treaty ports are already receiving such protection as is possible from the naval forces in the Far East, and no protection can be provided other than by the naval forces, which we recommend should be increased.(d.) British interests inland can receive no protection unless they are on the navigable rivers. Missionaries and isolated individuals if threatened -    should be withdrawn to the ports.(e.) Modern gunboats should be provided for use od the rivers in China.(/.) An increase in our military forces in the Far East is desirable so that a small reserve may be available to meet emergencies such as the present.(g.) For. the reasons given in the Joint Note circulated with this Report (see annexure) offensive action in China on a large scale is not possible for the British Empire acting alone, and finality could not be hoped for from any operation within our capacity. Offensive action on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.(Signed) BEATTY.CA VAN.H.

June 30, 1925.C.O.S. 25. Joint Note by the Naval, General and Air Staffs.1. Present Situation.(a.) North China.At the moment there is no disorder in Peking or Tien-tsin, but there may be a conflict between the rival Chinese leaders Chang Tso-lin, of Manchuria, and Feng Yu-hsiang, known as the &quot; Christian General.&quot;Chang Tso-lin was last reported at Tien-tsin. Plis total army amounts to some 200,000 men. In comparison with other Chinese forces, his troops are well armed with rifles, machine guns and trench mortars. He maintains his own arsenal at Mukden, in Manchuria, where modern machinery has been installed. He has over 200 aeroplanes, of which a large number are unserviceable ; he also appears to be ;short of pilots. He has about 200 held guns. The Manchuriau army is an organised army, but cannot be. compared in. moral or fighting efficiency with Japanese or European troops.        . .Chang Tso-lin has moved about 40,000 men, representing 3 divisions, to the vicinity of Tien-tsin. In addition to these divisions he has 10 divisions along the Peking-Mukden Railway, close to the Manchuriau border.Feng Yu-hsiang has a force of 3 divisions and 2 mixed brigades in and around Peking, amounting to some 76,000 men. These troops are well disciplined. He has no established arsenal, but is known to be improvising one in the mint at Ivalgan. He is reported to have received munitions from the Soviet authorities, including 4,000 machine guns. A press report states that he has also received 80 light field guns, 40 heavy guns and 20 boxed cars of ammunition. Discipline apart, Feng&apos;s forces are less formidable than those of Chang.
The present Government in Peking consists of Chang Tso-lin&apos;s nominees, whereas Peng is in military occupation of the city.(b.) Shanghai.The students are still maintaining the organised strike, and negotiations for a settlement have failed. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps (for strength, see enclosure No. 1), assisted by foreign naval detachments, appear to have been successful in keeping order inside the International settlement. Isolated conflicts take place, and it is reported in the press that the students are still planning further outrages against foreigners.(c.) Hong Kong.The Canton secret societies have brought about an extensive strike by threats of reprisals, and the Chinese employees have left Hong Kong in large numbers. The Hong Kong Government appear to have the situation fairly well in hand, and the organisation of civilian personnel to maintain essential services has been put into force. The Volunteer force has been mobilised.(d.) Canton.The so-called South China Government at Canton is now openly under the influence of Soviet agents. A local demonstration resulted in firing on Shameen Island, which was replied to and silenced with the assistance of French marines. European women and children have been evacuated to Hong Kong, and two platoons of Indian infantry have been sent from Hong Kong to safeguard property in the British and French concessions on Shameen Island.(e.) Other Treaty Ports.Disturbances are reported from Hainan Island, Swatow, Amoy and also in the Yangtze Valley. Where possible, the British Admiral Commanding-in-Chief has sent gunboats to stand-by and, if necessary, assist the evacuation of foreigners.2. Possible Sources of Reinforcements and Attitude of Foreign Powers. (a.) Reinforcements.British. The nearest British garrison is at Singapore, but in view of the small size of this garrison and of the large local Chinese population, it would not be safe to count on any reinforcements nearer than India.French. Annamese troops would no doubt be available from Indo-China.American. The nearest reinforcement is from the Philippine Islands, but this would consist mostly of coloured troops It is known that the American General Staff has worked out a scheme for i-einforcing with a Brigade about 3,100 strong.Japanese. Ample reinforcements are available in South Manchuria and Korea, where there are, in all, three Divisions. Certain units in the Liaotung peninsula are known to be earmarked for a rapid move in the event of disturbances arising in China.(b.) Attitude of Foreign Powers.The French have comparatively minor interests, but are always ready to uphold with vigour their treaty rights under the protocol of 1901. Their co-operation in North China is, therefore, assured, and in view of their concession in Shameen it is probable they would co-operate also at Canton.The American attitude is incalculable on every occasion.The Japanese are eager to co-operate in any international undertaking, but would nut initiate any pressure to-day without the moral support of the other Powers.3. Future Developments.(a.) North China.The situation depends on.whether Feng and Chang come to blows, and, if so, who wins. If Feng succeeds, it indicates the predominance of Soviet influence in the Peking Government, which will lead to further trouble.(b.) Shanghai.The situation is unlikely, at this stage, to develop into a dangerous outbreak, but much depends on the daily incidents, any one of which may cause a conflagration.
(c.) Hong Kong.So long as the strike continues, the present Hong Kong garrison will be rendered immobile.(d.) Canton.The Canton Government for many months has been organising anti-foreign measures by attempting to seize the customs and to levy illegal taxes on foreign goods. Therefore a repetition of such, or perhaps more drastic, measures can only be expected.(e.) Other Treaty Ports.Nothing beyond isolated rioting is considered likely to occur in the immediate future.The political trend of events shows that at no distant date the Chinese students&apos; cry of &quot; China for the Chinese &quot; will be sufficiently powerful to create, for the first time in history, a Government in China with a strong national spirit. The Bolshevik propaganda in China, as elsewhere, is being conducted on nationalist lines. Thus, this national movement is aimed largely against the foreigners in China and at the abolition of extra-territorial and other foreign treaty rights. Until that object is achieved, in and around foreign concessions, settlements and treaty ports there is likelihood of constant, even if only intermittent, trouble, caused by Chinese agitators or Bolshevist agents.4. The British interests in China, for the protection of which Naval, or Military action might become necessary, are : (a.) The security of the Island and leased territory of Hong Kong, and of the concession at Wei-hai-wei. (6.) Participation in any action by the international force in North China to whichwe are committed by treaty, and the security of our contingent there, (c.) Safeguarding, so far as possible, the lives, property and interests of british nationals in China.5. In view of the extremely difficult country between the Island of Hong Kong and the northern frontier of the leased territory, the existing regular garrison of Hong Kong (1 British battalion, 1 Indian battalion and certain R.A. and R.E. units;, together with the Volunteer forces, is considered sufficient to protect Hong Kong against any probable Chinese aggression from the north, at any rate until the arrival of reinforcements. It should, alternatively, be sufficient, together with the existing police forces, supplemented by the voluntary efforts of the European community, to secure internal order. But it could not deal with serious internal disorder and external aggression simultaneously without a reinforcement of at least two battalions.If the anticipated possibility. of Canton coining permanently under Bolshevik influence materialises, the danger of simultaneous internal disturbances and external threats will increase, and will necessitate a permanent increase of the garrison.6. Our participation in the international force in North China is-at present limited to one British battalion, the responsibilities of which include : (a.) Provision of Legation guard at Peking.(6.) Guarding a section of the railway from Peking to near Tientsin, (c.) Provision of detachment at Wei-hai-Wei.(d.) In time of trouble to play their part in keeping open communications between Peking and the sea.For the above duties a battalion is barely sufficient in normal times, and quite inadequate in case of serious trouble (see Appendix I to the Report by the Chiefs of Staff, OO.S.-19 (Revised*There are serious objections to a permanent increase of our force in North China, but some reinforcements should be available at short notice in case of emergency. Our only other garrison in the Far East Hong Kong-is, as shown above, at present sufficient only for the security of Hong Kong itself.7. British communities exist at all the principal ports and trading centres of China, and may also be found, as missionaries, in any part of China. The protection of all these cannot be a military responsibility.* Also O.I.D. Paper No. 617-B (Revised).
The only treaty ports at which, we might have a potential military liability are: (a.) Tientsin (discussed in paragraph 6).(b.) Canton, by reason of its proxirnity to Hong Kong.(c.) Shanghai, by reason of the International force there, which is under a British commandant.8. The importance of the foreign settlements at Shanghai and the size of the International Volunteer Force maintained by the Municipality make it possible that the Volunteers might become so seriously involved as to require assistance.Here again the present size of the Hong Kong garrison does not admit of any substantial reinforcement in normal times, and of no reinforcement in the event of simultaneous trouble in Hong Kong itself.9. The permanent addition of two battalions (1* British and 1 Indian) to the garrison of Hong Kong would relieve any anxiety as to the security of our principal possession in the Far East, and would also provide a small reserve on which it might be possible to draw in an emergency for the reinforcement of the North China garrison or of Shanghai. It is for many reasons preferable to increase the Hong Kong garrison rather than that at Tientsin.The fact is that the policy of reduction has brought our military forces in China to below the safety limit.It must, however, be emphasised that this reinforcement would be only sufficient to enable the tasks outlined in paragraph 4 to be more efficiently performed. It would give no possibility of any offensive operation against China. If such is ever con-templated, it must be an International commitment, and the British quota must come from India,; The initiation of such action, the scope of it, and the extent of the British share in it, are matters for the Foreign Office, and the future, and are beyond the scope of this note.10. Naval Considerations.(a.) Forces available.Available Naval forces and their present disposition are shewn in Enclosure No. 2. The disposition of these vessels can be altered to suit the changing situation as desired, or in the event of Military action being determined Tipon they could be utilised for convoying troops, covering landing operations or for bombarding strong points. As an essential preliminary to any offensive action it would be. necessary to withdraw H.M. Ships now employed protecting British interests at certain settlements. It would be necessary, therefore, to evacuate European personnel from these places.(b.) Inadequacy of Present Forces.At the present moment all ships are employed, and there is &quot;no margin for reliefs. This cannot continue indefinitely. Personnel and materiel will not stand it. At the same time it is unlikely that we shall be able to strengthen our naval forces commensurate with possible developments.(c.) Reinforcements.No naval reinforcements can be depended upon at Hong Kong from other stations in less than three or four weeks from the time of orders being issued.11. summary the situation in China is a political and evolutionary puzzle which it is for the Foreign Office to appreciate.The military significance of the present unrest lies rather in the promise it gives of further and more serious disturbances in the futuie than in any present danger.There have been many examples of the plans of the Soviet Government going off at &quot;half-cock,&quot; but that does not mean that their policy of penetration and disintegrate-tion is more than temporarily checked, and in China there are stronger forces at work below the surface than Bolshevism. It is these stronger forces which must be considered in making plans for the future.This note deals only with the military and naval aspect of recent events.* N.B. This implies the employment on garrison duty iu the Mediterranean of a Guards&apos; Battalion, in order to make another Line Battalion available for service ill China ;  tad the borrowing of an Indian Battalion from India, which would come on Army Votes.
From the naval and military point of view, it is essential to realise that offensive action on a large scale is not. possible in China for the British Empire acting alone, China is a vast country offering no decisive military objective. Given time for preparation, the necessary troops, and the acquiescence of the other foreign Powers, it might be possible to capture Pekin, Canton, or one of the great towns near the coast. These could be held to ransom or destroyed, or temporarily occupied. But that is the limit of the possibilities of offensive military action, which amounts to no more than a programme of raids. No finality is to be hoped for from it. The force required in most cases would be considerable, varying from one to two or more divisions.Offensive action in China on a large scale can only be international, and even on that basis it would probably be unprofitable, except possibly for Japan, who must be the predominant partner.The military problem of the moment is the safety of our possessions, concessions, interests and nationals in China.Even protective military action is limited to localities where direct naval support can be brought into play, and to the security of the legations in Pekin and their communications to the coast.As stated above, it is the opinion of the combined Staffs that our present naval forces and garrisons in China are, in view of possible developments, inadequate. Temporary military reinfoi*cement at short notice is impossible, for the simple reason that no reinforcements are available nearer than India, and these would take at least a month to organise and convey to Hong Kong. Thus the only way to provide against an emergency is to increase the garrison of Hong Kong.General Staff, June 30, 1925.Enclosure No. 1 to Annexure. Stkength of Volunteer Forces in China.	Strength.
