Off UlfjJSOTJiNVIG MAJESTY&apos;S t3Qv&quot;EHHMBH!P)j C S B f-365(252-&quot; &quot; 0 A B I N E T.LIMITATION Off AJfctAMSKTS.Kote. ,jby the Secretary of the Committee of I rap e rial JJe fence.At the meeting on July 22nd, 1925 (Cabinet 39(25)) I was instructed to place myself In touch with the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services with a view to formulating proposals as to the nature and scope of an enquiry Into the question of Limitation of Armaments.2. I have now seen the three Chiefs of Staff, and/ have also been in communication with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and as a result the following propossis are submitted..3c The question of Limitation of Armaments is one in which the three Services are affected in different ways. In their technical aspects the problems with which the Services are confronted are quite distinctive,  and the same is true to a considerable extent of the mere general aspects of the question.     As was found in the case of the ennuirv which led up to the formulation of instructions for the British Delegates at the Washington Conference, it is only after the technical side has been explored from each point of view that the problem can be dealt with usefully as a whole and from a more general and political point of view.la o
4. The Chiefs of Staff are therefore unanimously of opinion that the best way of opening up the question is to invite each of the Services first to explore the problem from its own point of view and to submit a Memorandum to tho Committee of Imperial Defence.     when these Memoranda are available the Prime Minister will be able to  judge whether he would like the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, or some ad hoc Sub-Commit tee, to examine the Departmental Memoranda from a central standpoint before they are laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence with a view to a Report to the Cabinet.5.    If this method of procedure is accepted it would follow from the recent discussion at the Cabinet that the Service Departments should be as Iced to approach the problem of limitation of armaments from a wide point of view.    They should consider the question not solely from the standpoint of the effect of further reductions of the British forces, but they should also consider the consecpienoes of a reduction of foreign forces not only on the British Empire but on the world position. Above all, they should be asked to formulate principles and constructive suggestions as to the methods and stages by which reduction and limitation of armaments can be pursued with the best prospects of success, irrespective of whether it is raised on British or on foreign initiative or by the League of Rations.      It should be impressed ii?0upon them that we and our late Allies/pledged by the Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles to further measures of general disarmament,  and that it is essential that the Government should have the material for dealing with the question whenever it may again become prominent.
6.    There is a good deal of material in the archives of the Committee of Imperial Defence, more particularly in connection with the Washington Conference, the Treaty of Mutual Assistance, the Geneva Protocol, and the question of poison gas, which will he available to the Service Departments in preparing their Memoranda.. It would also be the ordinary duty of the Secretary to the Committee to search these archives for any material which bears generally on the question of limitation of armaments, with a view to the preparation of a precis.7.    If the above proposals are approved,  it is suggested that a copy of this Poto should be sent to each of. the Service Departments, with a request that they will examine the problem of Limitation of Armaments in the light of the suggestions contained therein.2, Whitehall Cardans, S.W.1. July 27th 1925c
