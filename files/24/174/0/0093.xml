660This document is the property ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.cPrinted for the Cabinet, August, 1925.SECRET.Copy No.   ^ UCP. 394 (25).CABINET.PROPOSED PURCHASE OF LAND AT SALISBURY PLAIN.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The development of the range of modern artillery weapons has caused the Army     118 Council to devote very special consideration to the existing facilities for training the Southern troops in. this country in their use.   At the present time there are no artillery ranges     203 which satisfy modern requirements, except to a limited extent that at Larkhill.   The other ranges were purchased many years ago and besides being too short for modern guns, they are mostly in very hilly districts of which the lower ground is chiefly bog and . marsh.   On such ranges it is almost impossible to practise the manoeuvre of guns.A second factor to be be taken into account arises from the development of the use of aircraft in war. No modern army can be considered efficient if the facilities for training in co-operation between air and artillery units are not complete. It is absolutely vital to the training of the army that artillery ranges should contain landing facilities for aeroplanes, but at present the only ranges in England where such facilities are present are Salisbury Plain and, to a limited extent, Okehampton. Under present conditions, of the batteries which shoot in any one year, 55 Regular batteries and 36 Territorial Army batteries fire at Salisbury Plain, leaving 52 Regular batteries and 232 Territorial Army batteries totally untrained in air co-operation each year. (For purposes of economy only half of the total of 268 Territorial Army batteries fire a course in any one year.)Further, owing partly to the conversion of certain Yeomanry regiments into artillery units and the necessity of coast artillery units practising as heavy batteries on land ranges (an outcome of the war),,the number of artillery units which have to carry out practice each year has greatly increased since pre-war days, while the number of artillery ranges has been reduced by the loss of Gien Imaal in Ireland, which served as a training ground for the artillery of two divisions. The resultant congestion is now acute, and is felt peculiarly by the Territorial units, for whom a selection of dates for carrying out annual training is essential owing to trade holidays, &amp;c. Before the war it was usually found possible to complete the shooting at artillery practice camps by about the middle of August. Owing to the present congestion it is now necessary to keep these camps open till well on towards the end of September. This has a serious effect on the higher training of the troops, since not only is practically the whole of the Government ground west of the River Avon (Salisbury Plain) unavailable for combined tactical training, but those units who shoot late in the year are prevented from taking part in it.The existing artillery ranges, together with the greatest range at which a field gun can fire with safety at each of them, utilizing to the full the ground available, are as follows : -Yards.Larkhill West Down Okehampton Trawsfynydd Redesdale ... Buddon     &apos;...These are maximum ranges obtainable only from one position, firing in one direction, and in some cases the value is discounted by the fact that the nature of the ground makes observation to the full extent impossible.7,500 6,000 7,000 9,500 5,500
The minimum&apos;ranges (in yards) considered necessary for efficient practice are : 	Manoeuvre	Extreme	Safety allowance.		depth.	range.	Range.	Lateral.Light guns and howitzers Medium howitzers Medium guns Heavy howitzers ... Heavy guns	3,000 3,000 3,000	9,500 10.000 15,000 12,000 20,000	1,000 2,000 2,000 2,000 2,000	1,000 1,500 1,500 2,500 1,500Allotment is made by brigades, and the capacity of ranges for accommodation is best estimated in terms of the &quot; brigade-week,&quot; i.e., the use of one range by one brigade for one week. (It may be mentioned that a brigade consists for practice purposes of 3 batteries in the case of Horse, 3 in the case of Pack, 4 in the case of Field, 4 in the case of Medium and 3 in the case of Heavy Artillery.) Each, of the six ranges can take .one brigade at a time. Allowing for the Regular Army Heavy Brigades (6) shooting every alternate year only, for the Territorial Heavy Brigades (17) not shooting on land ranges at all, and for only 40 out of 71 Territorial Army Field Army Brigades, practising each year, 92 brigade-weeks a year are required. This allows nothing for the Tank Corps or for any increase in artillery. Light artillery (18-prs. and light howitzers) can shoot on all six ranges. For medium artillery (60-prs. and medium howitzers) it is necessary to use all the six ranges, but only the Salisbury Plain ranges are at all satisfactory, and even there the medium gun is limited to shooting entirely with reduced charges. Heavy howitzers can fire on the Larkhill range only, and heavy guns (6-inch) cannot fire on any existing land range.The time available on the Larkhill and the West Down ranges is always liable to be reduced by four weeks or more each if the ground is required for army manoeuvres ; and in view of the climatic conditions in Scotland and the North of England and the fact that Territorial brigades can shoot only at certain periods dependent on local employers of labour, it is only just possible to fit in 92 brigade-weeks. This allows of practice for only a limited number of units.The Army Council have also had to consider the situation caused by the decision to evacuate in the course of the next few years the Tank gunnery training camp at Lulworth, the purchase of which was sanctioned in 1921. Great opposition was raised to the purchase of this land, and since the range was clearly inadequate for future needs, allowing of no room for the development of the combination of fire with movement, or of co-operation with Air units, it was eventually decided to look elsewhere for a site suitable for a permanent Tank gunnery range.In searching for new artillery ranges it is necessary to consider not only the size of the ground, possibility of manoeuvre, and of aircraft co-operation, but also proximity to the centres of military activity, and after a prolonged search it has been found that the only area of ground which at all satisfies the conditions is immediately to the west of and contiguous with the present War Department ground at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. The area involved in the scheme now put forward consists of approximately 32,400 acres.The Council are satisfied that the acquisition of this area would greatly assist in solving the problem before them. Its proximity to the military centres on Salisbury Plain would permit of the periodical use of a greatly enlarged area for the manoeuvres of all arms ; it would provide a range for Tank gunnery in place of Lulworth ; it would provide an artillery range with facilities for air co-operation which should accommodate 44 additional batteries by combining its use with that of the existing artillery ranges alongside, it would allow of training&apos;with heavy artillery, which is at present possible on no existing range; and finally it would provide a field firing range for the Machine Gun School at Netheravon, which is urgently required to obviate the present grave interference with the training of other units.The land in question is chiefly used for agricultural purposes, the down land, which constitutes the bulk of the area, being used mainly for sheep-farming, but a considerable portion has an enhanced value due to its adaptability for gallops used in connection with training establishments - in the neighbourhood. The area comprises approximately 70 farms, and in addition to the farmhouses and cottages that form part of these farms, there are about 60 dwellings (houses, cottages, &amp;c).
In view of tHe purposes for which the land is required, it will, of course, be necessary to impose somewhat stringent conditions on the civilian user of the land and also to effect the evacuation of buildings situated within the danger areas of the ranges. These, however, are measures necessarily incidental to the provision of additional ranges and training grounds, and it is considered that the disturbance of civilian interests will not be greater in this case than it would be in the case of a possible alternative, and also that the price, which works out at an average of less than  26 an acre, compares favourably with that o  any equivalent area of suitable land that could be selected.The total cost of purchase is estimated at  834,000, about 40 per cent, of which covers the following items : (a) compensation to tenants for disturbance and tenant right, (b) consequential damage, (c) severance, (d) training establishments and (e) an allowance for contingencies.-As a set-off to this expenditure, the Council will be able to make the range at Trawsfynydd available for disposal, and they will save the cost of purchasing the Lulworth property, less the cost of reinstatement. The net saving from the latter source will probably not exceed  5,000, and the sale value of Trawsfynydd is estimated at  20,000. The disposal of Trawsfynydd will also save the money that would have to be spent on this range if it were retained, which is estimated at, roughly,  15,000. There will probably be a small saving of at least;  500 a year on the transport of units to the new range instead of to Trawsfynydd, and the Council will endeavour to secure a revenue from the new estate so far as letting proves to be practicable. The amount of such revenue is difficult to estimate until the extent and conditions of military use are settled, but, on the assumption that the bulk of ths land is fully used for military purposes, it is considered that receipts of not less than  8,000 a year should be obtained.It is the intention of the Council to leave the ground as unencumbered as possible ; but capital expenditure in the neighbourhood of  20,000 will be involved in making the new ranges available tor use. The question of replacing any of the accommodation surrendered at Lulworth, which for the most part would have had to be replaced in any case had that station been permanently retained, will be considered on the most economical lines.The Treasury have been asked to give approval in principle to the scheme, and the council are providing a sum of  125,000 in Army Estimates, 1925-26, to make a beginning with the purchase of the land.L. W.-E.The War office,17th August, 1925.
