According to a list furnished in 1924 such annual payments are made in 25 cases , the payments ranging from , 5.57- up to  130 and the total being about  1,300.     The Convention of Royal Burghs and the Association of County Councils in Scotland have-now agreed to the commutation of such annual payments by the payment of capital sums on the basis indicated in the appended&quot;Bill.
