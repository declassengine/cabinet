President of the Council.The investigations into the desirability of attempting to use the Severn Estuary as a source of electrical    power has reached a stage in which an important decision has to be taken.So far the course of events may be briefly summarised as follows:-In 1920 a Committee of the Board of Trade reported that there was ample justification for a    detailed enquiry into the technical aspects of the problem, and recommended that a Commission should be appointed for the purpose.Financial consideration prevented anything being done until 1924. when an informal Committee of the Board of Trade wasappointed to report on the scope and probable cost of the-necessary investigations.     This Committee drew up a scheme of enquiry which would take three years at least, and would probably cost something between  70,000 and  90,000.      Thereupon the Labour Government, in July 1924, decided that before embarking on this large expenditure a preliminary investigation should be undertaken in order to determine whether, as an engineering proposition, a barrage in the Severn Estuary was practicable. The Department of Scientific and Industral   Research was entrusted with the Investigation, and appointed the Severn Barrage Committee to undertake it.
J idIn the opinion of this last Committee geological evidence points to the conclusion that satisfactory foundations for a barrage exist, and that a barrage could be erected.The way Is now clear,  therefore,  for continuing the scheme on the lines suggested by the Informal Committee of the Board of Trade, provided the Government are prepared to find the cost, estimated (as I have already stated) at something between  70,000 and  90,000, and run the risk that this costly Investigation may end in shewing that,  for some  (as yet unforeseen) reason, the scheme is impracticable.In order to minimise this risk, the Committee recommend that the investigations be divided Into three stages,  so that if an Insuperable obstacle were revealed in the earlier stages the los3 might, as far as possible, be limited.      The first of these stages is estimated to cost about  28,200.In coming to a decision the following observations may be helpful: -(1) The cost of the engineering Investigation, large as it sesms to be and is,  cannot be deemed excessive If the cost  of the project -  (say) 20,000,000 be kept In view.      Moreover it would be spread over a considerable period,  probably not less than, four or five years.(2) On the other hand,  It would require to be supplemented by an economic enquiry into the effect which the completed scheme would have upon shipping, etc, and also Into Its relation to any scheme for bridging the Severn.
(3) I understand that the completed programme, including the necessary legislation, might take seven or eight years from the present date.      Its adoption therefore would have little bearing upon the. problem of unemployment.(4) It has been estimated that, when completed, the scheme would provide from 1.000,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 electrical units per annumf or, very roughly, one-sixth of the number of electrical units generated in Great Britain for ail purposes in the year ending March 1924.It is worth considering whether the whole project might, with advantage, be referred to the Committee of Civil Research, seeing that it touches the provinces of the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Admiralty, and,  of course, the Treasury,A.J.B.4 Car it on Gardens, S.Vf. August 4th,  1925.
