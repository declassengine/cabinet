5. My Committee have considered the War Office memorandum and are agreed that it is not possible to examine the question exhaustively and report to the Cabinet before the Parliamentary Recess.      They are of opinion that the general organisation of the Army Medical Service requires complete investigation and that for this purpose witnesses both in and out ef the Service should be heard.      Such an investigation would take time. Moreover,  they consider that the Medical services of the Navy and Air Force should also be examined.6* It is understood, that the question of the status of Nuaesin the Army requires consideration.    The Committee consider that this question should be dealt with concurrently with that of the Army Medical Service and the Medical Services of the havy and Air Force,  and that possibly the Committee of Tnroe,  to be app-pointed to examine the maintenance costs and interior economy of the ffiavy, Army and Air Service, might include them in their enquiry.    In any case the Committee do not think that any decis-ion should be reached on ths question of the Pay of Officers in the Army Medical Corps until the whole organisation of the Service has been considered.ireOOHMZIN D \ TIOKS^ The Committee recommend that the organization of the Army Medical Service should be examined exhaustively as a whole before any decision is reached on the question of the Pay of Officers of the lioyal Army Medical Corps.,  and that the War Office should, if necessary, make temporary arrangements to tide over their immediate difficulties.They recommend that the Medical .iervices of the Wavy andUr Force should also be examined.They suggest that these investigations might be entrusted to the CommittoC^**part of their enquiry into the maintenance   k costs and economy of the three services-oignod on behalf of the Committee.

-IPPSMDIXPay etc.  of Officers of the B.ol.M.0.Memorandum by the War Office.1. The proposals for improving the pay and retired pay of Officers of the lioyal Army Medical lorps submitted to the Treasury in  vugust 1924,  are set out in Appendix       page 12, of the printed memo,, on officers1 pay already circulated to the Committee.      A copy is appended herewith for convenience (Enclosure  iV).      The Air Ministry and admiralty have also put up proposals for improvement in the rates and conditions of medical officers.      The R.A.1?. proposals are on similar lines to the Army proposals, but those for the Navy are it is understood based on entirely different principles.2. The necessity of some improvement in the conditionsof R.A.M.C. officers is  evidenced by the following:-(a) So few candidates for entrance to  the R.A..MsC. have been forthcoming that it has been found necessary to cancel advertised examinations and accept by nomination such candidates that have presented themselves.(b) Senior officers are resigning in increasing numbers.(o)  The total shortage at present amounts to 90 officers.(d)  This results in an increasing burden of foreign service being thrown on those who remain with its attendant expenses and produces further resignations.(tj) Civil Medical practitioners have to be employed inconsiderable numbers at home. This is found to be a hamper in the efficient administration of the Medical service.(f) The British Medical Association have constantly urgedthat the conditions in the h.A.MoC. are not sufficiently attractive to entice keen young men into its ranks, especially having regard to  the opportunities available toda-y in the civilian medical profession.3. In June 19 25,   the Treasury replied refusing all theWar Office proposals.      x copy of their letter is attached (Enclosure B).      The War Office answer to the criticisms raised are given in enclosure D.4. On 30th June 1925,  the Secretary of State for Warmet representatives af the British Medical Association in oonference.      Ee was gratified to find that War Office proposals met with their general approval.      It is however desired  to add 4 minsr proposals to  the original proposals.5. the War Office proposals for dentists - Royal irmyVeterinary Service are based on their proposal for R.A.M.C.War Office, 10th July, 1925,

Sir,I have laid before  the Lords Commissioners of Eis Majesty *s Treasury your letter of the 16 th August,  1924 (100/Hedu/89 5 (1.2)), respecting the emoluments and conditions of service of Medical Officers of the Army and I am directed to lay before the Army Council the following reply.My Lords have compared the emoluments of the Medical Services of the Navy, Army and Air Force not only with those of the Medical Officers serving in various Public Departments e.g. Ministry of Health, Prisons&quot;etc.,  but also with those of the civilian profession, so far as the information   is available, and Taey are convinced thaHJpo far as emoluments go they compare not unfavourably with any branch of the Medical Profession.For example, My Lords have ascertained by comparison with statistics of earnings for 1922/23 furnished by the Board of Inland Revenue that if allowance is mads for the value of non-effective benefits the total pay and allowances of a Captain, Royal Army Medical Corps,  or of a Naval or Air Force Surgeon of equal service, exceed the  earnings of 50&apos;/&amp; of the income tax paying doctors in oivil practice *     Further an efficient medical officer is assured of promotion on a time basis to Commander, Major or Wing Commander in which rank his total emoluments, on the same basis,  may roach a figure which is exceeded by the earnings of about Zbfc only of the civil profession.      The finaneialfposition of officers who attain promotion beyond these ranks undoubtedly compares favourably with that of the more successful members of the civil profession..     Little more than 10$ of tho civil profession earn more than the pay and allowances, plus value of pension rights,  of a Surgeon Captain Royal Navy or a Colonel Royal Army Medical Corps.They believe that the causes of the difficulty of obtaining Medical Officers for tho Services must be looked for elsewhere.Among the contributory causes the following have been represented.During the past 6 years, of the students qualifying for the medical&quot;&quot; profession a large number had had war service, and there has been a natural reaction in favour of civilian employment.      The average age of students owing to their war service has been higher than normal.      Many are&apos;married or about to be marriod&quot;and wish to settle down to a civilian career.During the same time the country has * own a large power of absorbing medical practitioners, who as they become qualified have found little difficulty in obtaining employment. This is attributed in part to war casualties and shortage,  in part perhaps to  the retirement of civilian practitioners who remained or returned to practice during the war.      There is at present no marked sign of falling off in this respect,  but withs Under Secretary of State, War Office,TREASURY C1IAHB3HS. Sc24599c 4th June,  19 25.
the large numbers now qualifying it seems likely that the limit of absorption will soon be reached.The opportunities of keeping abreast of medicalscience are much more limited in the Services and the amountof work falling to be done by each individual is too smallto attract a young man who is  really interested in the profession of medicine and who has no special leanings towards a Service career,      This is in part duo it is represented toexcessive establishments in relation to peace requirements.In civil life the population for attendance on whom a general practitioner looks to make his livelihood averages about,000.      The average panel doctor has about ls200 patients onhis list,.      The maximum number of panel patients to 1 doctorallowed by the Ministry of Health is 2,500, and generallyspeaking a panel doctor has 2 private patients to 1 panelpatient,      A battleship with a crew of from 10200 to 1,500(concentrated in one ship, instead of scattered like a civildoc tor7 s parctice) will have at least two medical officers.Moreover the 1,200 are picked and healthy young men,  and anyserious case of illness is forthwith removed from the sickbay to a hospital.      At Malta, where the garrison numbers4,819 there are 16 Royal Army Medical Corps officers on theestablishment,,      At Gibraltar with a garrison of 2,886 thereare 11.      In Great Britain there are 430 Royal Army MedicalCorps officers on,, the ^regimental establishment compared with about 110,000 officers and men.My Lords recognise of course that establishments of Fighting Services may have to be kept at a strength which may bo out of pooportion to actual peace requirements.      They r ef er t-r the above figures primarily as illustrations of the difficulty of obtaining candidates who are likely to obtain such limited opportunities of exercising their profession, iJut I am to observe that My Lords do not think there can be any question at the present time of increasing establishments.Among other reasons given for the difficulty of attracting candidates is the absence of independent responsibility of young officers.My lords have reached the conclusion tho.^ at the present juncture no advantage will be gained by increasing the emoluments oi* the establishments of the Medical Services of the Kavy, Army and Royal Air Force.      The advice given them is that only by an utterly disproportionate increase of emoluments oould satisfactory recruiting be assured,  and having regard to the high establishments They consider that vacancies can safely be left unfilled until the special demands of the civil population generally have been met by the present rapid growth of numbers.A similar letter has been sent to the Admiralty and Air Ministry.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)      G.L.  SiRSTOW.
4 t5 3(Enclosure &quot;G&apos;0A conference took place on 30th Jane, 1925s with representatives of tho British Medical Association at whioh the letter expressed strong views as to, the necessity of various changes in conditions if the British Medical Association is to continue whole-hearted support of the Army career for doctors.    As a result four points have emerged,  concession on which will great-ly relieve the situation.    (They are distinct from the general proposals put to  the Treasury last year - War Of fie e letter iOO/Medo/895 (F.2) of 16 tk August 1924 and Treasury lettor So 24599 of 4th June 1925.j(l)    The Pay Warrant already provides that a medical officer who at the time of passing his examination for admission to the royal Medical Corps, holds or is about to hold a resident appoint-men t in a civil hospital, may bo seconded for one year and that this period shall count for promotion,  pay increments and retired pay and gratuity.      It is proposed to allow the same thing by means of antedate,  for an officer who passes the examination at the end of his resident appointment.    There is no difference in merits between  the two classes and the concession is a reasonable one.      The position of these house surgeons is quite different from that of the ordinary university candidate.    They aro analagous to Fellows at Cambridge and Oxford,(2)    The second point is one of pension rights.     Under the 1914 Warrant a major could retire after 20 years with retired pay of  365 a year-.      Under the post-war regulations,   the method of calculating retired pay is different and the retmred pay rates are subject,   in respect of 20$,   to variation in accordance with changes in the cost of living.    It is possible, under the post-war regulations j for a major uo retire after 20 years with pension which is already below  365 a year or is liable, with cost of living fluctuations,  to fall below that figure.      The normal rate at 20 years is  396 which with 5-^ off &amp;  373 so  that a further Zfo deduction would bring the  rate down to  36 5.Under Article 4 of the Pay &quot;/arrant, an officer who was a major in 1919  retains a right to  365 if he retires as a major, but a captain or Lieutenant promoted Major after 1919 has no vested right to the  365.The proposal is to grant to all medical officers who were serving when  the new retired pay regulations were introduced a reserved right to the pre-war  365 rate without deduction if it is more favourable.    It is not impossible  (but would be rare)  for the post-war pension code to be less favourable than the pre-war code for officers of other Corps besides the Royal  &apos;..rmy Medical Corps.      But it is not intended to allow the right outside the Royal Army Medical Corps.The Army Council became aware only yesterday that the Admiralty, without it is understood,  consulting the Treasury, have already communicated a similar concession in the case of Naval Medical Officers to the British Medical Association, so that apart from the merits ox the case it would be impossible for the War Office to refuse similar treatment.The cost of this proposal depends entirely on whether the cost of living figures fall below its present rate in 1927.(3)    Thirdly,  the deputation made some far-reaching and expensive proposals with regard to retirements of Lieutenant-Colonels, with a view to accelerating1 promotion to that rank.
It is not proposed to take up their main suggestions, but in one small point a change is da sir able .      .&amp;t present a lieutenant-Colonel, when&apos;passed over for promotion is put on retired payo      In  the ordinary course this does not occur until he has been a Lieutenant-Colonel  ib r 6 or 7 years.      It is proposed that in future a Lieutenant Colonel who is not conaid-ered fit for promotion shall bo placed on the half-pay list after 4 years as lieutenant-Colonel.      The effect will be tc accelerate the retirement of a certain number of Lieutenant-Colonels by some  5 years,  but the numbers concerned will be very small and the financial effect will be almost negligible.(4)      The flat rate of specialist pay to be 7/6 instead of 5/- as proposed in Enclosure &quot;4&quot;.
Enclosure &quot;D&quot;.Oomparison of emoluments of Medical Officers of the three Services has bo en made by the  Treasury with those of Medical men in various public departments and with the earnings of civil practitioners as declared for Income  rax purposes, with the  result that they are satisfied that the emoluments in the fighting services compare favourably with those in   the Oivil Medical profession.AS regards the information contained in tho returns of income for purposes of taxation, it is not possible to criticise the treasury s statement, for the data used are not available,,It must not be  forgotten  that a doctor&apos;s gross earnings and those subject to income tax are two very different things.The Treasury say  that the emoluments of a Captain, E.A.M.G. exceed the average earnings of 5Cf; of doctors in civil life and that the emoluments of Majors are  exceeded by only about 25^. of the Civil profession.    (promotion to Captain in the R.A.M.C. takes place after Zjf years and to Major after   12 years service) cInteresting as these comparisons ma;/ be they&apos;are really to a very large extent beside the mark..      The proposals of the Army Council were not put forward until the position of medical men in Government Services and in Civil life had been carefully conside red.The comparison made by the  Treasury ignores entirely tho expense that a Royal Army Medical Corps Officer has to incur owing to the conditions of Army life and especially the liability to frequent moves and the large proportion of Overseas service involving as it often doss the maintenance of a second establishment at Home.The position of serving officers has not been touched, the fact remains that officers with families are unable to live as Army Officers on their pay and many are forced to r otire as they cannot meet the expenses of moves and service abroad.Among the contributory causes mentioned by the Treasury as militating against the supply of Officers  for the R.A.M.C. are Y/ar weariness and the increase of Civil opportunities of employment for medical men..     As regards the  former it is now sis years since the Armistice and the men who are passing out of the Medical Schools now  (who in 1918 were,  say, 18 to 20 years of age) can have had little or no war service,  but as there is no decline in the disinclination  to come forward for commission, no doubt the spirit is still prevalent in  the medical world.The suggestion of- the Treasury that the limit ox  the power of absorption of medical practitioners into tho civil profession will soon be reached is,  of course,  purely speculation..It may be true .out this will without doubt be followed by a corresponding fall in the registration of Medical Students, which follows the law of supply and demand in tho same way as in any other profession or business.      This has indeed already happened as during the past 2 or 3 years there has been a very marked reduction in  tho number of students registered.      It may be added that the new regulations governing medical education will have the effect of adding both to the length and the expense of
the curriculum which may be expooted to limit still further the new entries.The argument that the R.A.H.G. provides inadequate opportunities cf keeping abreast of medical science and insufficient work tc attract the keen young men, even if it were base! upon fact, which we are not prepared to admit, really constitutes an argument for making the conditions more attractive.      It is true of the Navy but it is emphatically not true of the ,;.rmy0The Treasury state that It has been represented that the R0.A..M.O0 establishment is excessive in relation to peace requirements ,  and instance the number of patients a panel doctor has on his list.      This comparison ignores on the one hand the Civil Hospitals,  and on the other the large amount of administrative work that has to be provided for in the K.,i.M.C. and the necessity of providing for reliefs at foreign stations.The percentage of R.A-M.O. officers who correspond tc panel doctors is certainly not in e xcess of the panel doctor proportion to patients.      The bi^lk cf R.A.M.C. are running hospitals or engaged in 3anitary and Pathological services besides administering the whole Army Medical Service and giving training and instruction to both officers and mon of the R.A.M.C..The Treasury are wrong in suggesting that the establishment of R.A.M.C. Officers is based on mobilisation and not peace requirements.      Tho establishment is based solely on peace requirements.The proportion of E.A.H*C. offioers per 1,000 troops of all arms proposed is 3.5 per 1,000 at home.      Of these probably not more than .3 are occupied solely in .such work as a panel practitioner performs.      At Malta the proportion is 3.7, and at Gibraltar 3.8 per 1,000.      These proportions cover&apos; administrative, sanitary, pathological service,  as well as the staffing of hospitals,  in addition to &quot;general practitioners&quot; work.      The  families of both Officers and men have also to be looked after and are extra for comparison with the figures for panel doctors.The Treasury are of opinion that matters may safely be left to take their own course and vacancies be left unfilled until the special demands of the civil population generally have been met, when it is presumably their view that lack, of oivil opportunity will result in divergence to the fighting servi ces.This presupposes that our establishments are excessive and that if they are half full we can get along.     As stateo&quot; above,  this is an entirely erroneous assumption.If the pr esent&apos;state of affairs is allowed to continue the R.A.M.C. will lose the majority of its best and most experienced officers and will have reached a condition from which it will be almost impossible to recover.
litre Treasury may be right in saying that the increases proposed will not alleviate the position, but that the cost&apos;of increases which would alleviate it is prohibitive.      It is not clear what this means.      there must be a R.A.M.C.  - even if we relied entirely on civil doctors on the panel system at home we could not do sd abroad and especially in India.
