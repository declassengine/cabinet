EXPIRING LAWS QQII TIKUAKQE BILL 1925.Memorandum by. the Financial Secretary to the Treasury,adjournment the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, 192 5.    as none of the laws which it is proposed should be continued expires before 23rd December next, it is not proposed to take any further stages of the Bill until the Autumn, promises have, however, been given in the past that the Bill would be introduced as early as possible in the Session and I desire therefore vo introduce the Bill forthwith.on the   Expiring laws Continuance act of 19 22 recommended that a periodical review at intervals of three years should be made by a Select Committee in order to prevent further congestion in the oohedule to the Act.      In accordance with this recommendation a Select Committee was appointed in March of this year and has issued its report (H. of C. Paper Ho.112 of 1925).      The Select Committee recommended (a) that certain sections of two Acts,  (The London Cab and Stage Carriage Act, 1907, and the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916) should be made permanent:    (b) that other Acts should be continued as they are either temporary in nature or of very recent date;    (c) that two .,vcts (the Wireless Telegraphy ,kct, 1904, and the Summer Time let, 1922) should be continued unless superseded by other legislation during this Session;    and that in tha case of two Aots (The Agricultural Rates Act, 1896, and the Agricultural RatesI desire authority to introduce before theIt will be remembered that the select Committee
Congested Districts and Burgh land Tax Relief (Scotland) Act, 1896) their subject matter should be dealt with by-fresh legislation and meanwhile that these Acts should be continued for another year.The draft Bill attached hereto (which has been agreed by the Departments concerned) follows the recommenda-tions of the Select Committee exce]rt in one particular. The Select Committee included in  the   iCts to be continued the Courts (Emergency Powers) *ct, 1914, but added a note to  the effect that they understood that the  let was no longer required and would consequently be dropped.    Further investigation shows,  however, that certain orders under the Act are still being acted upon and the Act has therefore been included in the Seoond Schedule to the Bill as an Act to be continued until 31st Deoember 1926.Items 22 to 25 of the Second Schedule were not among the Acts considered by the Select Committee but their inclusion in the Bill is nevertheless necessary.It is necessary to retain in the Schedule the &quot;. Wireless Telegraph feet, 1904, as the Wireless Telegraphy (Explanation) 3111 now before the House of Commons does not deal with the questions which arise in connection with the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill.The Summer Time -,et, 1922, has been provisionally included in Part I of the Second Schedule to tho Bill.    In the event of the Summer Time Bill which la now before Parliament becoming law, the necessary amendment to the Schedule will be made before introduction of fcho Bill.W.G.Treasury Chambers, 16th July 1935.
