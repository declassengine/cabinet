CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction oh the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.]THE POSITION AT CANTON.CANTON has been the scene of two wars with China, 1839-41 and 1856-57. In each case British military action, chiefly naval, had to be taken after a prolonged course of provocation by the Chinese. The present development of events seems to be following the same course. In some respects Canton is cut off from the rest of China, as there is no through railway communication with the north. It is also more immediately and exclusively in touch with the British Empire, since it is situated about 100 miles up a river, at the mouth of which is the British colony of Hong Kong.Since 1917 Canton, like the rest of China, has been a prey to various military factions, and the dominating personality in this part of China has been that of-Dr. Sun Yat-sen. His party, the Kuomintang, Extreme Nationalists, have become increasingly powerful. The Canton Kuomintang have been distinctly anti-British for some time, as can be seen from their connection with the Hong Kong seamen&apos;s strike in 1922. Early in 1923 a new factor was introduced by the opening of a Soviet consulate at Canton, and from that date the dissemination of advanced political theories and anti-foreign symptoms amongst students and officials became more manifest. At the same time the extremist wing of the Kuomintang obtained control of the party machine, including Dr. Sun. Dr. Sun died in March 1925, and this removed the last moderating influence. At the end of May 1925 there was fighting in Canton, as a result of which the Canton extremists were left in supreme power in the city.Their sympathy was naturally with the strikers in Shanghai and with the anti-foreign movement. There were anti-foreign and especially anti-British demonstrations in Canton, culminating in firing, which was almost certainly started by armed men on the Cantonese side. The fire was returned by the foreign troops (French and British), and a number of Chinese were killed. Foreign women and children were then evacuated to Hong Kong. The Canton Communist Government issued an &quot; ultimatum &quot; to the foreign Consular Body in Shameen, which is the name of the foreign concession in Canton, but no reply has. been sent to this document.Although the Kuomintang are in a numerical minority in Canton, they are the only organised party, and they are in control of the so-called Government. They have succeeded in imposing on the people the party flag in place of the old national colours in token of the fact that the Kuomintang represents the modern Chinese national spirit. Their aim is an advanced sccialistic commonwealth, to attain which unity must be achieved. An-.i-foreign feeling is the one thing which unites all Chinese to-day, and it is easy for those responsible for the troubles and internal wars of the past ten years to divert the discontent on to the heads of the intruding foreigners.Further, for the last two vears the Kuomintang have been urged on by Soviet representatives and aeents. This is abundantly evident from the secret archives of the Foreign Office. The most serious development in this respect has been the establishment of the military training school for officers at Whampoa, just outside Canton. This school was founded by the Communist section of the Kuomintang for the purpose of providing officers for their forces. A contribution was made by the Soviet Government to the school on its foundation. Of the foreign instructors, two are Russians and two Japanese. The Russian instructors supervise the teaching of Communism, and the Japanese are responsible for military education and training. There are 660 resident students. The British military attache, after a visit to the school in March 1925, came to the conclusion that it is distinctly a military asset for the master that owns it; and the students proved their usefulness in the fighting in May last. .We have therefore at Canton a foreign community of three to four hundred,* a* This is an estimate of the foreign population in normal times.   At the present moment (according- to the &quot;Times&quot; of the loth July) there are only s.venty- ive civilians in Shameen.-   2968   [13325] &apos;CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.J
large proportion of which are British, living in a concession which is in fact an island in a river, and therefore not unsuitable for defence. It is at present protected by foreign gun-boats and a small force of troops. It is faced by a Chinese city of about one million, with a rising tide of fanatical anti-foreign feeling. The Govern-ment, if it can be called a Government, is composed of adventurers with Communist leanings. They are influenced in turn by Russian agents, who are straining every nerve to provoke trouble between us and the Chinese. They have considerable military forces, and it is not an easy operation to reach Canton with foreign military strength. -The latest information is that there is considerable military activity in the neighbourhood of the Bocca-Tigris fort (the Bogue forts of the earlier wars). These are situated about half-way between Canton and Hong Kong, at the point where the river widens into an estuary. At this point a large Soviet vessel, carrying a quantity of small arms and troops appears to have landed certain Russians. Commodore, Hong Kong, reports other information pointing to the possibility of Russo-Chinese occupation of Bocca-Tigris, in order to prevent access to Canton.These activities may indicate an intention to besiege the foreign concession in Canton; but more likely it is intended as an act of deliberate provocation in order that Great Britain may take military action and so appear as the aggressor in a new China war.It is therefore necessary for us to be patient and cautious, but, at the same time, we must remember the danger threatening our people in Canton. A disaster there or a forced evacuation would be equally deplorable.The Foreign Office has been in communication with the Admiralty as to the best means of securing the safety of Shameen, without taking aggressive action; and the Admiralty have suggested that the threat implied in the strengthening of the Bocca-Tigris forts can be ignored if we have air power strong enough to take, if necessary, forcible action in and around Canton. This, they say, can be assured by the presence near the scene of action of an aircraft-carrier completely equipped. The situation is certainly sufficiently menacing to justify the despatch of such a vessel. Time is an important factor; and it is accordingly submitted that orders should at once be given for the despatch of the aircraft-carrier to Hong Kong.Foreign Office, July 9, 1925.
