(l)    MOROCCO.  ACTION I IT EVE3T OF INVASION OF THE IITTERHAT 10HAL ZONE BY ABD-EL-KRIM.620-B(C.I.D.Papers ITcsi  6l8-B/and 621-B) (Previous Reference C.I.D.Minutes of 200th Meeting Minute9) The Committee had under consideration a Repo*t by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the action to be taken in the event of the invasion of the International Zone at Tangier by Abd-el-Krim (C.I.D. i-aper 6l8-B).MR. CrIAMBillRLAlH said that he raised the question of the situation in Morocco as a matter of urgency in view of a despatch he had just received from the Embassy at Madrid (this, despatch was subsequently circulated together with a&apos; despatch from the Foreign Office to the Embassy at Paris C.I.D,Papers No. 620-B and 621-B).     The Ambassador at Madri.4 said that the Spanish Government had invited British naval participation in the s-urve ilia nee of contraband arms traffic in the waters of the Tangier Zone and also hoped that this surxeillance might be extended to the waters of the French and Spanish Zones.      Further there had been a Conference between representatives of the French and Spanish Governments at Madrid, the results of which might be summarised as follows ;-(l)    The Sultan had given instructions for inhabitants of the Spanish Zone escaping into the Tangier Zone to be handed over to the Spanish authorities.(2)    The French and Spanish Governments had invited the authorities of the Tangier Zone to consider the advisability of of disarming the inhabitants of the Fans Province.(3)    That a joint      force of 1560 men (British Fremch and Spanish) under a Spanish Commander-in-Chief should be organised to protect the Tangier Zone and to preserve its neutrality.The French Government had not yet sent any communication and it appeared very desirable for the views of the BritishGovernment to be communicated to Paris before any communication was received from Paris:, the French ambassador had stated that he was certain his Government would wish to
associate themselves in the request for joint naval surveillance but he had readved no instructions regarding a joint-force for the Zone.As regards British participation in the   surveillance of the waters of the Tangier Zone, although he did not think that any gun-running was really taking place since the Riffs had a large supply of arms and also got more arms illicitly from Spanish families when they required them, yet this appeared to be a reasonable request;    by Article IV of the Convention the surveillance for contraband in these waters was laid jointly on Britain, Prance and Spain;    he deprecated, however, the extension to British participation to action in the waters of the French and Spanish Zones.The actual situation with regard to Abd-el-Krirn at present appeared to be that though he might be considered a threat to the Tangier Zone, yet he would not attack it unless provoked to do so, since he did not wish to involve himself in hostilities with Britain nor give any reasons for Italian intervention,,      The organisation of an International force in the Zone aeemed to be the most likely way of provoking Abd-el-Krim and he thought that Prance should be informed at once that the Spanish proposals had been received but that the idea, of organising a joint force for the Zone did not commend itself to the British Government both because it might provoke Abd-el-Erim and also might give reasons for Italian intervention.,LORD BEATTY,  in answer to a question on the military situa-tion, made a statement based on the Report of the Chiefs of Staff  (C.I.D.Paper Io0 6lS-B).      He pocnted out that the War Office already had a plan for the despatch of one battalion  from Gibraltar and emphasised that the need for safeguarding our communications through the. Mediterranean was so vital that if the neutrality of the Tangier Zonewas really threatened it warranted the despatch of two brigades and a proportion of ancillary troops.
This would mean the use of Section &quot;A&quot; Reserves.    The reason why the Chiefs of Staff suggested sending so large a force was because British, interests in the neutrality of the Zone were so great that it was considered we ought to take a predominating part in protecting it.LORD CAVAIi said if it was proposed to organise an International Force discussion should be instituted with the French and Spanish Staffs.SIR L AMI KG WORTH IilGTOii-EVAlfS said the War Office wished to proceed with the registration of Section &quot;A&quot; Reserves and also to work out the plans for the mobilisation and embarkation cf the forces recommended by the Chiefs of Staff.MR.  CHAMBERLAIN said he considered that no action should be taken which would become known either withregard to the reserves or in any other way but he thoughtthat plans should be worked out so that action could betaken quickly if necessary.     As regards the right ofsearch, of vessels belonging to other countries in the TangierZone,  no declaration that  such search would be enforcedwas necessary.     He was not sure of the status of Americanships in this connection and would have the questionexamined.      Vessels of all other hat ions had no special -rights either because they had surrendered them at theTreaty of Versailles or because they had never had them.TFtfl. COIiKITTiflJi took note of the report of the Chiefs of Staff SuT^TJomittee (C.I.D. Paper^b .6i8-Bpand agreed to recommend: (l)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send an immediate despatch to the French Government saying; that various px^proposals had been received from the Spanish Government regarding Tangier and that His SSa j esty&apos;s Govermnnet: -(a)    Were ready,  in accordance with the Convention, to partake in Raval a^veillanae   of contraband arms traffic in the waterb of the Tangier Zone but that they
saw no reason to extend this action to the French and Spanish Zones.(b)    Deemed the maintenance of the neutrality of the International Zone at Tangier eo important, that if this Zone were attacked they would be ready to join in conceited defence measures;    but that they considered the proposal for the organisation of an International Force in the Zone inadvisable as this was likely to precipitate the very crisis which It was desired to avoid by provoking Abd-el-I r im and to give grounds for Italian intervention,(2)    That the Foreign Office should examine the position with regard to the right of search of vessels belonging to other nationalities within the Tangier three-mile Zone.(3)    That Naval action should not be taken until a requesthad been received by the Admiralty from the Foreign Office.(4)   That the War Office should continue to prepare secret plans including the normal enrolment of Section &quot;A&quot; Reserves for the despatch of a force of two Brigades and ancillary units but no communication with Foreign Powers should be made regarding the organisation of an International Force without the authority of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
(2)    FACT OF SECURITYc(Papers No, 616-B and 619-B ).(Previous Reference C.I.D, Minutes of 200th Meeting, &quot; Minute&quot; 10&quot;] IThe &apos; Committee had under p onnideration- a Note by-the-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs covering the draft of a Treaty of Mutual Guarantee which had been prepared by the Foreign Office (C.I.DsPaper No. fil6^B:),  and an explanatory Memorandum on the proposed security settlement of Germany&apos;s Western frontier in its rolation to Germany1s Eastorn frontier, which had also boon prepared by the Foreign Office? (O.I.D.Papor No. 619-B)....MJi*-OHAMBBELAIir&apos;explained that tho draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee (CI0D.Papor No. 616-B), had been prepared not with the object of presenting it to the French Government as a dooumont incapable of . altoration or amendment,nor as the last word of the British Government on the subject, but because it was desirable       in our future conversations with theFrench to work upon our- -own draft in proforeno-e to- working upon a draft prepared by the French Governments       Tho French would be certain to include in any draft which they might produce various detailed points which the British Government had been at groat pains to exclude in the correspondence which had already passed between tho -two- Governments,  and this would entail beginning the work all over again.     He had informed M. de Fleuriau that he was at the moment considering^ the terms of a draft Treaty,  and ho understood that the French Ambassador was actually in possession of a, French draft and had asked permission from his own Government to hand a copy to the Foreign Office.       He now enquired whether the Chiefs of Staff had any observations to make on the proposed draft.LORD BEATTY stated that he had no questions to ask.LORD cavan stated that the General Staff were whole -; ( heartedly......
heartedly in favour of a pact.      The fundamental strategic doctrine of the. General Staff was that the security of England depended oS a policy of keeping the areas of probable disturbances on the Continent as far as possible from our own shores.       They considered that the proposed pact if successful would assist In this object.     Moreover,  the General Staff considered, that it was essential to the future security of Europe that Germany should take her place along-sido the Western Powers *       The Eastern boundary of civilised Europe was now the Russian frontier and it would be dis-astrous if Germany were driven to find a new orientation towards the East.       With regard to the military commitments for England involved in the draft pact the General Staff were unable to read Into it any greator commitments than we already had under the Treaties of Peace and. the Covenant of the League of Nations *       The only new commitment appeared to be that of supporting Germany against France in case of the latter&apos;s defaults    It appeared hardly possible to imagine this commitment materialising into action,  since the mero lining up of Germany and England together would put any aggressive action by France out of the question.     Turning to the various Articles of the draft it would appear at first sight that three of the Articles lend themselves to criticism, namely Articles 4, 8 and. 10.       With .regard to Article 4, it was recognized that the the oretical invocation of the cumbrous machinery of the League was inevitable.      It appeared more than probable, however, that any action taken under the pro-posod Treaty would in. practice be taken as the result of a direct exchange of Notes between the various Governments concerned.      At first sight Article 8 had appeared to be somewhat obscure, but after studying the Memorandum by Sir Oecil Hurst,  contained in 0.I.DoPaper Ho. fi!9-B, the General Staff    ad no criticism to offer.     With regard to Article 10^9 the......
1 11Jl *i xPOSITION [HEIKIONS.lETMENTtlio provisions of this Article appeared hardly in keeping with the designation of &quot;The British Empire&quot; which appeared in the preamble to the draft, said.MR. CHAMBERLAIN/that there existed alternative methods of drawing the document.       Either the Dominions should be giventhe opportunity of contracting in,  should they desire to doso, or alternatively of contracting out.       The methodadopted in Article 10, namely of giving them the opportunity of contracting in  appeared to be the better.He agreed, however, that the designation should be altered to read &quot;Great Britain&quot;, SIR CECIL HURST explained that Article 10 had been framed &quot;in accordance with the doctrine that If any portion of theBritish Empire were at war the whole Empire was involved.MR.AMERY considered that the Article as drafted was satis-factor;?&apos;.       He agreed that if this country were at war the whole Empire was technically in a state of war, although the Dominions might legitimately refuse to render material assistance.SIR HUGH trenchard stated that he had no remarks to make on the draft Treaty.SIR SAMUEL HOARE enquired whether under this Treaty we were undertaking any obligation to intervene without a direct authorization from the Council or the Assembly of the League of Nations.MR.CHAMBERLAIN stated that we were pledged to intervene inthe event of the Council of the League failing to reach anagreement.       Under Articles ip. and 17 of the Covenant such agreement must be unanimous,  excluding those countries whichwhichwere parties to the dispute /     did not possess the right to vo;on such a question. The .Treaty had been framed with theobject of preventing any case arising in which the employment;of force was  justifiable without reference to arbitration j.nits widest sense.       There was, however, one exception,RGSely.....
namely that mentioned in Article 13- In whilcb, Pranoe-,&apos;&apos; &quot;Belgiumor Germany were. permitted, to rosort to war in self defence inrosistanoe. to invasion or attack by one of the other oontrs^ting,parties&quot;;   &apos; He pointed out that in the Covenant of the Leagueafterof Nations we were pledged not to . go to war, except hotk resort to the procedure &apos; la id dour., therein..     If Germany became a*member of the League she would be equally bound. CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION then took place vdfth regard to the- :-difficulty of defining whxch stato was. In fact the aggressor.   \-It was suggested,, for instance, that aeroplanes from Gernany might cross the frontier of Framoe...    France might consider such&apos; action a violation of the Treaty and attack. Germany-&apos;whilst Germany denied tliat her aeroplanes.had orossed the frontier.Again, both sides might mobilise on the /frontier and minor incidents might arise between, the opposing; forces&apos; in which it would be difficult to defino which si&amp;e had actually fired the first shot,MR. CHAMBERLAIN considered that it was impossible -to guard against every eventuality such as had been suggested might arise.      If the facts of the case were not sufficiently clear he considered that undor the proposed Treaty this country was justified in refusing to tako action until the&apos; question had been roforred for consideration to the Council of the League of Mation3...SIR L All III! WORTIIIHGTOH EVAHS expressed the opinion that some divergence existed between Articles 1 and 2 of the draft.    In Artiifcje 1   the parties guaranteed to maintain the inviolability of the frontiers between France and Belgium on the one. hand and Germany on the other, whereas Article, 2 appeared, to authorise a resort to war in seIf-defence in rosistanoe. to invasion or attack.MR, CI-lMBERLAIH explained that Article 1 was ,a general, statementof    *
X eJ Dof tho object to &quot;be attained by the Treaty as a whole. &quot;Self defence&quot; was not a violation of Article 2,      Tho country which was invaded raust be allowed to resist immediately. If it were clear&apos; that the aggressor had not waited for a decision on the dispute by the Council of the League of Nations, it was only logicalthat tire country attached should, not be required to do so either. The term, &quot;self defence&quot;, however, was perhapssomewhat inaccurate,  since it did not mean exactly the same as &quot;resistance to invasion or attack&quot;.lie called attention to Article 6 which stated that Arbitration&apos; Treaties should be concluded between x ranoe and Germany and between Belgium and. Germany respectively,  providing for the peaceful settlement of all disputes which may arise between them.      If this country were pledged to guarantee such ArbitrationTreaties it was perfectly obvious that we must be por-mitted. to scrutinise most carefully the terms of such Treaties before we could give our guarantee * .    He pointed out that in any Treaty France would require the utmost precision.      Previous British Governments had always refused, to be precise.   Ho was desirous of making the present document more precise than the Covenant of the League, In fact, our liabilities under the proposed draft were reduced because in the case of one frontier  by making it perfectly clear that we- were prepared to make our maximum, effort,   it Has/;&apos;in the&apos;case of the other frontier :e fvere not.. He considered that no FrenchGovernment would bo so foolish as to go to war unless they were perfectly certain that they would carry us with them.
a 4foRlTY SIR SAMUEL HOARE enquired why in Article 12 it was.fisioNSI/jrp laid down that the Council of the League of Nations couldJuc II of league-  act by a majority.,SIR CECIL HURST explained that the wording in Article 12was practically a verbal repetition of the Tripartite .Agreement of 1919.      It was clear that under the presentTreaty Great Britain gave all and got nothing, and Article 12had been included in order to give us an opportunity of .getting out of our agreement should we desire to do so atowing to a change in the international situation, some future date/     It appeared obvious that a decision inour favour could only be obtained by a majority vote of theCouncil of the League of Rations,  since a unanimous votewould necessariljT- Include France, and it appeared extremely unlikely that the latter would agree to renouncing the Treaty,MR. AMERY expressed the opinion that the suggestion thata majority vote should be -permitted was a most dangerousprinciple.       Such a principle appeared to strengthen theidea that the League of Nations was in reality a sort of proper conception of the super State.      In his opinion the/League was that     .    -        -;of a number of Powers in conference.,MR. CHAMBERLAIN stated that he had received a letterfrom the Lord Chancellor who was unable to be present at themeeting.     Referring to Article 12 the latter pointed out -&quot;The provision that the Treaty shall continue in force until on the application of one of the parties to it the Council, acting by a majority,  agrees, that the league Itself affords sufficient protection, appears to me to involve some rlskA If either France or Germany should desire to.get  rid of the Pact and should secure a majority on the Council, the Pact may be destroyed S under this Article&quot;.He, personally,  considered,  however, that it was to theadvantage of this country that such a loophole for withdrawalshould, c .
should be included.      In time the authority of the Leagueof Nations might develop and the countries concerned in theproposed Treaty might feel that they could trust theirsafety to the auspices of the League.BquESTION LORD BALFOIJR suggested that it would be preferable to1\ TIMEIpj, insert a clause whereby a 5 years notice should be given byany party desirous of terminating the Treaty.     He also suggested that the duration of the Treaty should be limited to 25 years *MR. CHAMBERLAIN considered it most undesirable to specify any date on which the Treaty should come to an end. He pointed out that in the correspondence which had already passed between the British and the French Governments we had concurred in the French view that no time limit should be specified.     He suggested that Germany might at some futureII -date wish to get rid of the Treaty because she felt that sheIwas in a position to attack France.     It was conceivable,although highly improbable, that on application to the Leagueshe might succeed in obtaining a majority..      In such anunlikely event our obligations to Germany would then automat-ically cease and we should be broiight into closer relationship with France.     He was convinced that France would not agreeto any limit being put on the duration of the Treaty.     Theperiod of 25 years sxiggested by Lord Balfour would terminateat the moment when France was at its weakest and Germany at itsstrongest.      The result of the Treaty, therefore, would bethat we shotxld be protecting Franco while she did not in reality need our protection, and leaving her to her fate atthe moment when she most required our aid.     He pointed outingthat Herr Stresemann wbJen justify/the German proposals had pleaded, that they were acting with the object of preventing the recurrence of the Franco-German situation of 1875.
17.)RD BALFOUR stated th it the period  of 25 years which ho had suggested vus rot intended to he arbitrary. Possibly a period of 50 years might be more suitable. His object was to prevent our being bound by a Treaty which was in reality obsolete-     Horally we were bound by any Treaty which was actually in existence, even if such Treaty were obsolete and thereby wo might lay ourselves open to a charge of bad faith.      He enquired as to whether it would be possible to refer the question of whether the Treaty did in reality become obsolete to the Court of International Justice.SIR CECIL HURST expressed the opinion that the Court of International Justice- would be unable to deal with such a question, and would merely refer it to the Council of the League of Rations-HR.   uIERY stated that the whole Treaty appeared to be framed with the object of bringing France and Germany closer together.    If at all successful it might be found that in course of time these countries wore working harmoniously together.    For these reasons he preferred that no reference    &quot;&quot;&quot; to the possibility of withdrawing from the Treaty should be included.MR. GH JIBERLAIII stated that the inclusion of such a proviso was desirable in order to appeal to that section of our own public who were deeply Impressed with the possibilities of the future of the League of Nations, and also that section of the public which were opposed to the commitments involved in any pacts of guarantee.    The French, however, would unquest ion-ably take exception to this clause.    He did not think that the introduction of a majority vote by the Council was in fact a dangerous principle.    In all cases of procedure,  and also the case under Article 213 of the Covenant,  the Council already acted by a majority.After some further discussion the Committee agreed -That Article 12 of the Draft Treaty should stand in its present form.
MR.  ALIERY----SIR LAMIPG WOHTHIWGTOH-EVAWS referring again to article 1, stated that he had now had an opportunity of discussing the question v-ith Sir Cecil Hurst.     He suggestedthat Article 1 should be&quot; amended to read &amp;S follows&quot;The High Contracting Parties severally and collectively guarantee in accordance with the following Articles the main-tenance,  etc.-&quot;&apos; e&apos;t&quot;c7&quot;&quot;MR. C H AMBE island I IJ then called attention to furthercomments which he had received from the Lord Chancellor..^ith regard to Article 7  (4) the lord Chancellor stated -&quot;I feel some difficulty ah cut this clause, the effect of which may he that we shall he compelled to assist in enforcing Treaties to he hereafter concluded between other parties, and the contents of which are still.uncertaln7VoHe was of the opinion that this criticism was met by Article 11 of the Draft, and he referred to his previous statement to the effect that we should naturally scrutinise the special Arbitration Treaties referred to in Paragraph 6 before giving our guarantee^MR. AMERY suggested that our obligations were not limited except In the case of invasion *    He suggested that a casus belli might arise, not necessarily on the frontier between the two countries concerned but in some other . portion of the world.      In such circumstances should we he compelled to intervene?MR. CHAMBERLAIN pointed out that wherever the casus belli might arise and the parties concerned went to war, the war must of necessity eventually bo fought on the frontier between the two countries.      In any event this question was fully explained in Sir Cecil Hurstrs Memorandum contained in C.I.D.&apos; .&apos;?--.por 619-B.
MR. AHERY referred to the second - part of Article 8 and enquired whether,in the event of tho French undertaking a further expedition into tho Ruhr without reference to arbi-tration, v/o should he compelled to assist Germany.112.- CHAMBERLAIN explained tho British Government had always hold that the seizure of the Ruhr by the French was contrary to the Treaty of Versailles.      Should the French repeat such an expedition he presumed that under the proposed Pact we should be required to assist Germany.SIR CECIL HURST considered that such a contingency was guarded against under the Arbitration Clause under the Dawes Agrc emeht.LfR.  .u/13RY then referred to the time limit in connection with the Occupied Areas.MR.  CHAMBERLAIN stated that should the French refuse to vacate the Occupied Areas mat the end of the 15 year period, it would be regarded as a breach of the Treaty of Versailles. He called attention to the fact that the Lord Chancellor considered the wording of Article 8 somewhat vague and suggested that Sir Cecil Hurst should consult the Lord Chancellor with a view to amendment0LORD 1ALF0UR stated that he was unable to understand th e meaning of A rt i c le 8.MR.  CHAMBERLAIN explained that if an Arbitration Treaty was concluded between Poland and Germany and if such a Treaty were guaranteed by France and Germany,  in the event of a German attack, by Poland in defiance of this Treaty, this country would not be involved.      Any guarantees given by us under tho proposed Pact  could not be used to shelter a wrong doer. He pointed out, however, that under Article 16of the Covenant of the League of Nations, wo should be compelled to take action in such an eventuality as he had described. He presumed, however, that any action taken by us would be of a limited character.
MR.  CHAMBERLAIN read to the Committee a note hehad received from Lord Cave regarding Article 13:this note was as follows:-Article 13-    It appears to me, and to the Attorney-General, that the effect    of this Article would &quot;be that,  if for any reason Germany did not &quot;become, or ceased to be, a member of the League, we should be guarantors of the frontiers of Prance and Belgium only and should be bach in the region of the unilateral guarantee.He had thought the two alternatives contained in the lastsentences of Article 12 and Article 13  ought  to be put to theCabinet.      In his own opinion if Germany did not proceedwith the Pact negotiations he thought it could be inferredthat Germany meditated a renewal of the conflict when herstrength had sufficiently recuperated.     He agreed with lord Cave and thought that Article 13 should be deleted.The Committee generally were of opinion that Article 13 should be deleted. CONCLUSIONS.The&quot;Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinetthe draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee contained inC.I.D.Paper 616-B, subject to the following amendments :-Article I, line 2,  after &quot;guarantee&quot;  insert&quot;in accordance with the following articles11Article 7,  (3), line 5, before &quot;Treaty&quot;  insert &quot;Said&quot;&quot;      7,  (4-) ,  line 2,  before &quot;Treaty&quot;  insert &quot;Said&quot; Article 8, line 1.    after &quot;Treaty insert&quot;provided such action is not inconsistent with the Covenant&quot;IThis Article also to be examined by Lord Cave and Sir Cecil Hurst with a view to ascertaining whether a simpler clause could be substitutedArticle 13.
