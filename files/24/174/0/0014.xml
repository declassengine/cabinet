Copy No.     SOCP. 315 (25).CABINET.ARABIA:  SITUATION AT AKABA.Note by the Secretary.THE attached Proceedings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, together with the Report of a Sub-Committee, are circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY,Secretary, Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, June 29, 1925.I.Extract from the Minutes of the 200th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence?held on June 22, 1925.(1.)-ARABIA:   SITUATION  AT  AKABA (C.I.D. Paper No. 613-B.) (Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of 184th Meeting, Minute 1 (4).)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Sub-Committee which had been appointed to consider the situation existing in the neighbourhood of Akaba (C.I.D. Paper No. 613-B).Mr. AMERY, with reference to paragraph 8 of the Report, said that both the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry were anxious to keep the defensive arrangements necessary at as low a scale as possible, and the Air Ministry had now agreed to find the extra flight required out of the air forces in Palestine; hence the only actual increase in forces would be the expansion of the Arab Legion. Now that ex-King Hussein had left Akaba and gone to Cyprus he hoped that Ibn Saud would be satisfied and acquiesce in Akaba and Maan being included in the Trans-Jordan Administration; there was, however, always the chance that some frontier raid might take place which would give rise to trouble, but he did not think that Ibn Saud wished to be at variance with the British Administration; it appeared to be most advisable to have a Conference with Ibn Saud as soon as possible to settle all outstanding boundary questions, as these were the most fruitful causes of dispute.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the extra commitment involved by including Maan within the Administration of Trans-Jordan necessarily meant a further liability, but the Air Ministry were ready to try and find, anyhow in the first instance, the extra flight required from the Air Forces existing in Palestine. There were actually at present only four machines in Trans-Jordan these would be increased to eight. The future depended on Ibn Saud. If he meant to be friendly the existing forces might suffice; if he became hostile an increase of forces in Trans-Jordan would be required. He considered that a Conference with Ibn Saud should be arranged as soon as possible to settle any points outstanding, and whatever happened at such a Conference it would be clear whether Ibn Saud was proposing to be friendly.13243 a&apos; b
SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said that the Report under consideration assumed that a cavalry regiment would be in Palestine; at present the Colonial Office was pressing for this &quot;regiment to be withdrawn on the grounds of expense. He considered that this cavalry regiment should remain for at least another year until it was known what Ibn Saud&apos;s attitude would be.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed that a Conference with Ibn Saud at an early date would be desirable, but he considered that the arrangements for this Conference should be made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whose Department was really the responsible one for dealing with this Arab Chief. He considered that it would be very desirable to have a British Representative with Ibn Saud so that a close liaison might be maintained with him, for although Hussein&apos;s family might have been in the past and might perhaps, as suggested by the Colonial Office, be again in the future the most important one in Arabia, it appeared that Ibn Saud was at present the chief power there.Mr. AMERY agreed that it would be advantageous to have a British representative with Ibn Saud, and said that he would make arrangements for a Conference between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and Ibn Saud as soon as possible.   The site of the Conference would be decided later.As regards the remarks of the Secretary of State for War, the area to be administered was larger than before, though the actual total length of the frontier was not increased. He was inclined to think that a, British cavalry regiment in Palestine was not particularly suitable for warfare in desert areas. He would prefer the Arab Legion and armoured cars : the cavalry regiment was also more expensive. At present the Middle East Estimates included  40,000 for this cavalry regiment, and local defence troops of equivalent value could be obtained for  20,000.LORD CAVAN said that he could not yet say what effect Abd-el-Krim&apos;s successes in Morocco might have on Egypt. Consequently, he could not guarantee the certainty of reinforcements from Egypt at a critical moment, and for this reason he considered it better to retain the cavalry regiment in Palestine for a year.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN agreed that the cavalry regiment should be maintained in Palestine for a year, since it was impossible to foretell what the results of Abd-el-Krim&apos;s successes might be. If trouble arose it would be essential to restore peace, and one cavalry regiment seemed to be a small insurance.LORD BALFOUR, referring to the possibility of Mohammedan unrest, said that as the French maintain over 25,000 troops in Syria, it appeared that we should keep, anyhow, some regular troops in Palestine.Mr. AMERY said that the whole system of maintaining internal order in Palestine was based on police and air forces and not on regular military forces. If Ibn Saud caused unrest on the Trans-Jordan frontier, then it appeared to him that native Arab mounted troops and armoured cars would be more effective than a British cavalry regiment in Palestine, which w^ould take a long time to reach the site of .the trouble and would then not be very suitable for employment in the desert. If, however, it was considered that a British cavalry regiment should remain in Palestine on general Imperial grounds, then he raised no objection, but he considered that the grant from the Middle East Vote towards the cost of upkeep should be no greater than would be necessary to provide the equivalent local defence forces, which, he considered, would be about  20,000.i SIR HUGH TRENCHARD said that as long as Ibn Saud was not hostile then he thought the Air Force could accept the extra commitment with the forces now in Palestine. If Ibn Saud attacked, or if there was general unrest, then he still thought that Air Forces combined with local Arab troops would be more suitable for restoring order than regular British troops.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said the whole policy in Palestine and Iraq had been to build up local forces, and as long as regular British cavalry were maintained in Palestine, the building up of local levies must necessarily be delayed.THE PRIME MINISTER considered that in view of the remarks of the Foreign Secretary the cavalry regiment should be kept in Palestine for a year, but that the question of payment for this regiment was not a matter for the Committee of Imperial Defence, and should be settled by the Departments concerned. He thought that no Supplementary Estimates should be submitted to Parliament for expenditure in Palestine based on military or defensive grounds.
89Conclusions.II.Report by Sub-Committee.IN accordance with instructions received from the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, a Sub-Committee, composed as follows : Major H. W. Young, C.M.G., D.S.O., Colonial Office (in the Chair),Mr. F. D&apos;A. G. Osborne, Foreign Office,Captain A. M. Peck, D.S.O., R.N., Admiralty,Colonel S. F. Muspratt, C.S.I., C.I.E., D.S.O., War Office,Air Vice-Marshal J. M. Steel, C.B., C.M.G., C.B.E., Air Ministry,Colonel C. W. G. Walker, D.S.O., Secretary,assembled on Wednesday, the 3rd June, to examine the situation now obtaining in the neighbourhood of Akaba, to consider to what exent this situation might involve additional commitments and to make recommendation as to whether any increases in the forces now in those regions would become necessary.[13243 a]   . b 2(i.) To approve the Report of the Sub-Committee on the situation in Akaba (C.I.D. Paper No. 613-B), the summary of the conclusion of which is as follows : &quot; (a.) That the situation with regard to Akaba is likely to improve as soon as ex-King Hussein leaves and Ibn Saud realises that the place will no longer be available for pro-Hejaz intrigues and will be incorporated in the Trans-Jordan Administration.(5.) That all possible steps should be taken to induce ex-King Hussein to leave Akaba voluntarily by the 17th June, and that with a view to this his future place of residence should be settled immediately.(c.) That the local authorities should take steps to extend the Administration to include Maan and Akaba, but that this Administra-tion should be conducted from Maan with no officials stationed at Akaba.(d.) That the following additional forces will be required to guarantee (c) above 300 men under a British officer for the Arab Legion; one flight of aeroplanes stationed at Amman with a landing ground, fuel supplies and wireless communication at Maan.(e.) That after ex-King Hussein has left Akaba one of His Majesty&apos;s Ships should visit the place at intervals.(/.) That in the improbable event of Ibn Saud attacking Akaba and a situation developing which the forces in Trans-Jordania cannot meet, sufficient reinforcements for the emergency, in the first instance, could be made available by the Air Officer Commanding, Palestine, and the General Officer Commanding, Egypt, provided the situation in those countries permits.&quot;(ii.) That the British Cavalry regiment now in Palestine should be maintained there for another year until it had been seen what effect Abd-el-Krim&apos;s successes would have on the Mohammedan world generally and what attitude would be adopted by the Wahabis.(iii.) That the question of the payment for the retention of the Cavalry Regiment in Palestine should be settled by the departments concerned, and no Supplementary Vote should be submitted to Parliament based on military or defence grounds.(iv.) That it would be advantageous to have a British representative with Ibn Saud and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be responsible for arranging a conference between representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government and Ibn Saud to settle all questions in dispute and particularly those connected with boundaries. * * * * * *
Report.1. We have had before us the telegrams passing between the Foreign Office, Mr. Bullard and the Officer Commanding H.M.S. &quot; Cornflower,&quot; and a Note prepared in the Colonial Office, dealing with the events leading up to the situation now existing between the Trans-Jordan Administration, Ibn Saud and ex-King Hussein. As we think that a somewhat full explanation of these events may be useful, we have attached this Note as an Appendix to this Report.2. Briefly stated, the unsatisfactory situation now existing is largely due to the lack of a definite and accepted boundary to the administration of Trans-Jordan in the regions about the north end of the Gulf of Akaba. In 1924, when the Koweit Conference was assembled with a view to settling certain outstanding questions between His Majesty&apos;s Government and various Arab rulers, it was contemplated that Ibn Saud&apos;s boundary should include some portion of the Wadi Sirhan; that Trans-Jordan should include Akaba and Maan, and that the Hejaz should be compensated by the inclusion of Khurma and Taraba. However, before an agree-ment on this question had been reached the Koweit Conference broke up and Ibn Saud attacked Trans-Jordan.3. Ibn Saud was then immediately informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded Trans-Jordan as including Maan and Akaba, and that any attack across these boundaries would be considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government as an attack upon territory for wdiich they were responsible. Similar information was conveyed to the Hejaz and Trans-Jordan Governments, who were informed that the boundary of Trans-Jordan extended to the shores of the northern end of the Gulf of Akaba in the neighbourhood of the town of that name. The administration of Trans-Jordan was not, however, extended at the time to include Maan and Akaba, which were allowed to remain under the administrative control of the Hejaz Government.4. Ex-King Hussein, after his expulsion from Mecca by Ibn Saud and his flight from Jedda, has taken refuge in Akaba, and as that place has continued to remain under the administration of the Hejaz Government, Ibn Saud has considered, and rightly considered, that it is being used as a port from which munitions are being forwarded for use against his forces and that ex-King Flussein is using it in any way he can to further his fight against the Wababis.5. We think it probable that Ibn Saud&apos;s threat to attack Akaba was made with the idea of inducing His Majesty&apos;s Government to occupy that place and thus prevent ex-King Hussein from making use of it. It appears possible that when Ibn Saud realises that his enemy is being compelled by the British Government to leave, he will no longer attempt any hostile action against Akaba; that he has no desire to include that place in his territories; and that he will be content for it to be embodied within and administered by the Government of Trans-Jordan. If this expectation is fulfilled, it will not be necessary to provide for the defence of Akaba. In any case, we do not advocate the occupation of that town by military forces. If Ibn Saud were to take it, after ex-King Hussein&apos;s departure, naval action alone would, in our opinion, be sufficient (see also paragraph 12).6. The question now arises what, in fact, the inclusion of Maan and Akaba within the Administration of Trans-Jordan means, and whether it will cause local disturbances. We understand that the programme contemplated by the High Commissioner for Palestine is as follows : The area will be administered and revenue collected from a Headquarters situated at Maan, which will also, in present circumstances, be the southern limit of the Railway administration. Akaba will no longer be allowed to be used by the local inhabitants as a base for Hejaz activities and will be controlled not by officials living in the place but from Maan.7. Before the present situation arose the Air Ministry had discussed with the Air Officer Commanding in Palestine the additional forces which would be required if the administration of Trans-Jordan were extended to include Maan and Akaba. The local military authorities considered that no resistance to the extension of the administration was to be expected, and thought that an addition of 300 men to the Arab Legion under a British Officer would suffice to guarantee these extra commit-ments. We note, however, that the collection of revenue in Trans-Jordan can only be carried out with the assistance of the Arab Legion, and think that a similar state of affairs is likely to obtain when revenue is collected in the Maan Vilayet. In this connection it should be noted that a considerable part of the force of 300 men must always be maintained at Maan to protect the aerodrome, Wireless Station (see paragraph 8) and generally for use as a military force; the whole of it cannot, therefore, be distributed throughout the vilayet to assist in the collection of taxes.
8. Accordingly, in addition to the 300 extra men for the Arab Legion, we consider li:..;&apos; some mobile reserve is required, especially in view of the more unsettled state of affairs now existing. This additional force can most suitably be provided by the Air and we accordingly recommend that an additional Flight should be stationed at Amman : this will entail a landing ground, fuel supplies and a small Wireless Station at Maan; whether this additional Flight can be made available from Palestine or whether it has to be provided from elsewhere must, we think, be decided by the Departments concerned-.9. The above forces are recommended on the assumption that the administration will be conducted from Maan and that no officials will be stationed at Akaba, From a military point of view also we think that Maan controls Akaba, for, although the latter place could easily be defended by a small force owing to the difficult approaches to the town from the north and the east, yet the provision of small forces in scattered places entails many difficulties which must be avoided whenever possible.10. We do not feel justified in recommending the date by which the Trans-Jordan Administration should be established at Maan, and think that this can only be decided by the local authorities; and further, we think that, after the Administration has been established at Maan, it may be possible that the local authorities may wish to locate officials for certain purposes at Akaba; this question can only be considered when it arises, but we are of opinion that should such officials be stationed at Akaba, then not less than a further 100 men, with an additional British officer, would be required for the Arab Legion, and a landing ground with wireless communication and fuel supplies at Akaba for the use of the Flight of the Royal Air Force recommended to be stationed at Amman.11. As mentioned in paragraph 5 above, it appears that the present acute situation is due to Ibn Saud&apos;s doubts as to the British Government&apos;s intentions with regard to Akaba, and that, when he realises that the town is being incorporated in Trans-Jordan and that ex-King Hussein is leaving, he will be content and no longer wish to attack the place. The departure of ex-King Hussein will, therefore, be the best proof of our intentions. This has been arranged for by the 17th June, and it should not be further delayed. We realise that the use of force to expel him might involve unfortunate complications, and we accordingly recommend that a decision should be taken as early as possible as to what his future place of residence will be, since, this having been settled, he may be the more ready to depart willingly from Akaba; it is also suggested that every effort should be made to persuade him to leave voluntarily, and that, if a suitable asylum has not been found for him prior to the 17th June, his ship should sail on that elate under naval escort to some such place as Aden pending a decision as to his eventual place of residence.12. After the departure of ex-King Hussein, we consider that occasional visits should be paid to Akaba by one of His Majesty&apos;s Ships stationed in the Red Sea, since such action will undoubtedly have a quietening influence on the local inhabitants and discourage Wahabi occupation of the town; further, if the town by any chance became occupied by Wahabi forces, which appears to be unlikely, once ibn Saud has realised that His Majesty&apos;s Government are including it in the Administration of Trans-Jordan, a naval ship could by gunfire, if such action were deemed advisable, inflict, losses on those forces and cause them to evacuate the town.13. In the event of Ibn Saud disregarding the instructions which have been sent him and pressing on with an attack on Akaba or further to the north of the Trans-Jordan boundary, and a situation arising which cannot be dealt with by the forces existing in Trans-Jordan, we think that, provided the situation in Palestine and Egypt admits, the Air Officer Commanding, Palestine, and General Officer Commanding, Egypt, could, in the first instance, make sufficient reinforcements available; it is suggested that these might take the form of two flights of aeroplanes from Ramleh which could be moved south to operate in the Maan flightfrom Egypt and cavalry and armoured cars from Palestine. These arrangements have, however, not been discussed with the authorities on the spot, but- we suggest that they appear suitable to meet any emergency which may occur.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.14. (a.) That the situation with regard to Akaba is likely to improve as soon as ex-King Hussein leaves and Ibn Saud realises that the place will no longer be available for pro-He jaz intrigues and will be incorporated in the Trans-Jordan Administration.        &apos;       .113243 a&apos;. b 3

Walker (Secretary).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, June 4, 1925.APPENDIX.Colonial Office Note on Events leading up to the present situation at Akaba.ON the 2nd May, 1923, the High Commissioner for Palestine was instructed to communicate the following assurance to the Emir Abdullah, and to consult with him as to the best means of making it public : -&quot; Subject to the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government will recognise the existence of an independent Government in Trans-Jordan under the rule of his Highness the Emir Abdullah ibn Hussein, provided that such Government is constitutional and places His Britannic Majesty:s Government in a position to fulfil their international obligations in respect of that territory by means of an agreement to be concluded between the two Governments.&quot;The announcement was made on the 25th May, 1923.The High Commissioner represented on the 4th June, and again on the 31st August, that steps should be taken as soon as possible to complete the Agreement, upon the conclusion of which this assurance was conditional. This despatch was received in the Colonial Office on the 11th September, and on the 11th October a further despatch was promised, which was received on the 12th November.On the 21st November, 1923, the High Commissioner was asked to concur in official instructions being sent to him with a view to the conclusion of the Trans-Jordan Agreement and the establishment of a constitutional Administration in Trans-Jordan. The official instructions were issued on the 23rd January, 1924. Meanwhile, however, on the 18th January, King Hussein had himself arrived at Amman, and on the 16th February, 1924, the High Commissioner reported that nothing would be done without his concurrence or contrary to his wishes by the Emir Abdullah and his Government, and recommended that discussion should be postponed until King Hussein returned to the Hejaz.It was decided, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office, to approve the High Commissioners suggestion.
On the 3rd April the High Commissioner reported that the Maan district, including Tebuk and Akaba, had been removed from Abdullah&apos;s control by King Hussein and constituted into a vilayet of the Hejaz, and it was decided that, subject to financial assistance being made available by the Treasury, steps should be taken to regularise the position.On the 5th June, 1924, the High Commissioner was instructed to remind the Emir Abdullah of the two conditions on which the independence of Trans-Jordan had been conditionally recognised, and to inform him that it was not proposed to proceed with the negotiation of the Trans-Jordan Agreement, or to contemplate the possibility of extending further financial assistance to Trans-Jordan until His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied, firstly, that the necessary steps were being taken to place the finances of the territory on a sound basis; secondly, that a constitutional Government had been set on foot; and, thirdly, that the territory hitherto administered by him had been replaced under his authority.On the 24th July the High Commissioner for Palestine reported by despatch that the Emir Abdullah did not seem disposed to accept the financial regulations, which had been designed by the new Chief British Representative, who had replaced Mr. Philby in April. He discussed the situation in Trans-Jordan in considerable detail, and recommended that the Emir Abdullah, who was at that time absent on a pilgrimage in the Hejaz, should be warned on his return that his acceptance of financial control was a condition of his being permitted to return to Trans-Jordan. This warning was duly conveyed to the Emir on the 22nd August, and the conditions laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government were accepted by him.On the 14th August a serious Wahabi raid took place against Amman, which was repelled by the R.A.F.As a result of this, urgent communications were addressed to both King Ali and to Ibn Saud on the subject of the Trans-Jordan frontier.Ibn Saud was informed on the 21st October that any unprovoked aggression within a boundary crossing the Hejaz Railway in the neighbourhood of Mudawwara, and reaching the Gulf of Akaba, south of that town, would be regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as an attack upon territory for which they were responsible, and that they would continue, as in the past, to reserve to themsleves full, liberty of action to deal with such aggression in the manner they thought best.At the same time King Ali and the Emir Abdullah were informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded Trans-Jordan as extending to a point south of Maan on the Hejaz Railway, and that it followed that if the authority of the Trans-Jordan Government were restored over the Maan area His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to render such assistance as might be practicable against unprovoked attack on Maan. The two brothers were invited to concert for the immediate retrocession to Trans-Jordan of the Maan area, and were informed that His Majesty!s Government were prepared to assist them and to define the exact frontier between Trans-Jordan and the Hejaz on the assumption that this frontier crossed the Hejaz Railway at or near Mudawwara and left Trans-Jordan access to the sea at Akaba.Ibn Saud replied on the 27th December to the effect that Nejd had recognised the authority of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government over the countries included under their Mandate, and she wished from the bottom of her heart that those Governments (presumably the Governments of Iraq and Trans-Jordan) would only know their real status and keep within the limits they were allowed. Nejd had maintained her own Government, and would continue to&apos; preserve the cordial long-standing relations between herself and His Majesty&apos;s Government. He added a protest against raids by tribes from the mandated areas and also against the use of British troops to repel what he described as a justifiable counter-attack. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to reply on the 5th November that the Sultan&apos;s protest had been received with the greatest surprise by His Majesty&apos;s Government, who considered that it was for themselves and not for him to protest against what took place when a body of his tribesmen committed armed invasion into an area under British Mandate. Pie was told that, should similar circumstances arise again, His Majesty&apos;s Government would act in precisely the same manner.On the 1st November the Acting High Commissioner of Palestine enquired if he might authorise the Trans-Jordan Government to occupy the Maan Vilayet should Ali abdicate without giving his formal assent to the retrocession of that area. He was asked in reply, on the 3rd November, what actual steps he contemplated for the occupation of the Maan Vilayet.
On the 17th November the Emir Abdullah suggested that in order to accelerate the retrocession of the Maan Vilayet to Trans-Jordan by direct negotiations with King Ali he should himself proceed to Jeddah. The Wahabi attack upon Jeddah was at that time in full swing, and His Majesty&apos;s Government had also received secret information which led them to doubt the Emir&apos;s bona fides in making this suggestion. j It was therefore decided that, in the circumstances, it was impossible to proceed with the proposed negotiations between the two brothers about the Trans-Jordan-He j az frontier.The High Commissioner^ detailed proposals for the occupation of the Maan Vilayet were received in the Colonial Office on the 30th December, 1924. They were discussed at an Inter-Departmental Conference at which the Foreign Office and Air Ministry were represented, and a reply was sent on the 25th February to the effect that the proposals had received careful consideration, but that they involved considerable financial liability and would also entail a considerable extension of military commitments. The undesirability of allowing defeated. Hejaz forces to take refuge in Trans-Jordan was fully appreciated, and it was recognised that such steps as were practicable in the direction of re-establishing the authority of the Trans-Jordan Government in the Maan Vilayet should be taken forthwith. His Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to the view that the ultimate frontier of Trans-Jordan should cross the Hejaz Railway at some point south of Maan and should be so drawn as to leave to Trans-Jordan access to the sea in the neighbourhood of Akaba. The present was not a propitious moment for defining this frontier or for the full incorporation of the Maan Vilayet within the area administered by the Government of Trans-Jordan, and the only step which could usefully be taken appeared to be to extend the control of the Palestine Railway Administration to the Amman-Maan section of the Hejaz Railway.King Ali was informed on the 24th February that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to take the above steps, and was warned that if he should be forced to evacuate Jeddah, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not permit him to establish himself in Trans-Jordan territory, as defined above, with a view to using Maan as a base for   activities against Ibn Saud.On the 28th February the British Agent at Jeddah reported that this communication had been duly made to King Ali, who had declared that the Maan Vilayet would never, in any circumstances, be used by him as a base for military activities against the Wahabis. As regards the railway, he stated that this had been handed over spontaneously to the Hejaz by the late Chief British Representative,, and that the Hejaz could not give up religious property without risk of criticism. The British Agent indicated that his opposition would be confined to this protest.The High Commissioner replied on the 7th March that the steps suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government were impracticable, and that it was essential that administration should actually be established in the Maan district.In a despatch which was received in the Colonial Office on the 30th March, he submitted draft estimates for the occupation of the Maan Vilayet, which involved a Grant-in-Aid from His Majesty&apos;s Government of approximately  10,000 on the assumption that the Hejaz Railway revenue would contribute approximately  20,000 towards the military expenditure.The Foreign Office had, however, ruled that this would be improper use of Hejaz Railway funds, and the estimate accordingly necessitated a Grant-in-Aid of just over  30,000. The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought it better to defer a decision until he could discuss the question with the flight Commissioner personally on his approaching visit to Jerusalem. This he did, and on his return to London he decided, in view of the situation arising out of the threatened attack on Akaba, that it was essential that the Maan Vilayet should be occupied and that the Treasury should be approached for the Grant-in-Aid mentioned above.To turn back now to King Hussein. On the 1st November, 1923, His Majesty&apos;s Government approved a proposal to hold a Conference at Koweit in order that the outstanding questions between Nejd and the neighbouring territories might be settled. It was suggested to King Hussein that the Hejaz should participate in the Conference. King Hussein thanked His Majesty&apos;s Government on the 4th November, but refused the Invitation on the ground of insufficient time and omission to consult him beforehand. He was informed on the 6th November that the Conference had been postponed until the 22nd November, and was urged to reconsider his decision. It was pointed out to him that a settlement of the issue between Nejd and the Hejaz was more likely to be in favour of the latter when
discussed at a Conference. In answer to this renewed invitation King Hussein sent a long and involved letter, the upshot of which was that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought not to have summoned any Conference to deal with any question affecting Arabs without previous consultation with him.On the 15th December the Colonial Office suggested that further pressure should be brought to bear upon King Hussein.Meanwhile, it was reported that King Hussein proposed to visit the Red Sea, ports and would arrive about the beginning of January at Akaba. From that place he would proceed to Amman for a visit of one or two weeks. He actually left towards the end of December, and it was thus impracticable to make any further represenla-tions to hirn. He arrived at Amman on the 18th January, 1924, and remained thaxe until the 19th March.   He embarked at Akaba on the 24th March for Jeddah.On the 30th December the High Commissioner was instructed to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this visit to urge Hussein once more to make arrange-ments to send a representative to Koweit. The folly of letting slip this chance of settling outstanding differences with Nejd and thus eliminating the risk of further aggression against the Hejaz by the Wahabis was to be strongly represented to him, and the support of the Emir Abdullah was also to be enlisted to the same end.The High Commissioner saw King Hussein on the 21st January, and reported on the following day that he had consented to the .Amir Zaid, who was then at Baghdad, going as his representative to Koweit, but with instructions to insist upon a return to the pre-war boundaries of Arab States.On the 5th February, His Majesty&apos;s Government concurred in the adjournment of the Conference until early in March, ostensibly on the ground of Colonel Knox&apos;s ill-health, but largely owing to a temporary deadlock having been reached. Ibn Saud was, at the same time, informed of King Hussehrs readiness to send his son to represent the Hejaz and was asked to nominate a suitably responsible representative to meet him.On the 2nd March a reply was received from Ibn Saud to the effect that he would accept with the greatest pleasure the suggestion that a member of his family should represent him at Koweit, but, in view of the fact that his family was at Riyadh, and the time of meeting was near, he merely sent back the former repre-sentatives. Colonel Knox was, however, informed on good authority that Ibn Saud could, if he saw fit, have sent his own son Feisal with the Nejd Delegation.It was reported, on the 3rd April that, in reply to a further suggestion to the same effect, Ibn Saud definitely declined to send his son to Koweit and said that he considered that the present Delegation was sufficient.There was no opportunity of pursuing the matter further.On the 11th April, His Majesty&apos;s Government decided, on the recommendation of Colonel Knox, that no useful purpose would be served by the continuance of the Koweit Conference.On the 3rd October, 1924, King Hussein abdicated as a result of the Wahabi attacks on Mecca.He took refuge at Akaba some ten days afterwards. He was informed that, pending His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision as to his future residence, he should remain at Akaba, unless in personal danger, when His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to his proceeding no further than Maan while the question was being considered.On the 3rd November, the High Commissioner for Iraq reported that King Feisal had formally invited ex-King Hussein to Iraq, and that the latter had accepted.On the 10th November, ex-King Hussein was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would raise no objection to his accepting the Iraq Governments invitation. He replied that he had received the invitation, but that he had heard that the Iraq Government were afraid of his interference in political and religious matters, and,that they wished him to give a definite undertaking not to interfere in such matters. He added that he would not, in any case, have accepted the invitation at present, as he was contented with Akaba and had no desire to undertake a fatiguing journey.Since that time ex-King Hussein has remained at Akaba, with the exception of one visit to the Emir Abdullah at Maan, which lasted for two days.On the 28th March a report was received that he proposed to move from Akaba to Maan in the near future, ostensibly to escape the heat. He did not, however, put this plan to execution.___o
