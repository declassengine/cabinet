-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT.SECRET. ,*Q A B I N E T.LICENCES FOR EXPORT OF ARMS. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.Two applications have been received for licences to eusport  arms which involve a question of principle on which I wish to obtain an immediate decision of the Cabinet.   The facts are as follows:-The B.S.A. Company state that they are in a position to obtain the following oontracts -(1)    1,200 - 1,500 Lewis Machine Guns for the lithuanian Government.(2)100,000 (with a possible further 100,000), rifles and bayonets for the Greek Government.Before entering into these oontraots the B.S.A. Company ask that a firm licence should be granted to them covering the period of manufacture and shipment which in the Greek contract may be as long as 2-g- to S years. Alternatively, the Company stiggeat that His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake to indemnify them against loss If the licence were subsequently canoelled.I regard such an Indemnity as impossible.     No Government could give an undertaking that at a subsequent date it or its successor would propose and carry the necessary vote in the House of Commons.     We are, therefore, thrown back on the alternative of giving firm licences over a long period.       The Foreign Office advise me that they have no political objection to either of the contracts, provided in the case of Lithuania that the War Office are satisfied that the quantities are suoh aa might reasonably be required for the defence of Lithuania.       At present
I am precluded by the Cabinet decision from giving anything more than a revocable licence, such licence being for a period of three months.     There is no doubt that on the ground of employment it is very desirable that these contracts should be placed   in this country. If they are not placed here some other country will get the benefit. The Company, after their Soviet experience, will refuse to take the contracts, unless they are guaranteed either the right of delivery or an indemnity.     It appears to me that the case ef large armament contracts, the execution of which neoessarily occupies a considerable time, Is indistinguishable in character from contracts for the building of war ships.     I suggest, therefore, that in such cases the Board of Trade should have power, subject to the assent of the Foreign Office and the Service Departments concerned, to grant firm licences covering the period of the contract.     If we do not do so, we shall in effect be limiting our manufacturers to taking small jobbing orders and refusing the most valuable ones.     Moreover, we shall be putting ourselves in the rather ridiculous position of giving the diplomatic assistance to firms to obtain contracts and then denying them the necessary facilities for carrying them out. I suggest, therefore, that the practical course is the one which I suggest, and that the previous decision of the Cabinet should be varied accordingly.I may add that in so far as aeroplanes or war ships may have been brought into the Arms Traffic Convention a similar difficulty would arise in the case of ships and aeroplanes, unless the course I propose is adopted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concurs in this memorandum.(Intld.)
