IKCONFIDENTIAL LSBRAR , 1[This Document is the Propert^ojjjis Britannic Majesty s Government:! Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1925.SECRET.C.P. 302 (25).CABINET.UNCLAIMED BALANCES OP PAY EARNED BY NATIVE MEMBERS OF THE  MILITARY  LABOUR CORPS   DURING  THE EAST AFRICACAMPAIGN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THIS question, which has been the subject of discussion between the Colonial Office, the War Office and the Treasury for several years, concerns a sum of about . 165,000. It will be observed from what follows that it has already attracted public attention, and it is likely to be a source of serious embarrassment if a solution cannot be found. I do not feel it possible to accept the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Army Council without first referring the question for the consideration of the Cabinet generally.1. At the end of the war it was found that there were large balances due to native carriers who had disappeared and whose relatives it would be difficult or impossible to trace. This position had arisen from the fact that, as in so many other respects, the organisation for the East African Force was improvised from local resources. It was not until 1916 that the arrangements for recruiting carriers were taken seriously in hand, but a satisfactory system of identification had not been evolved until a later stage of the operations. The difficulty which has arisen is, therefore, primarily due to a cause which might have been avoided if the importance of the operations had been foreseen from the start.2. When the matter attracted attention locally, it was proposed by the Director of Military Labour (Colonel Watkins, a Colonial Official, now Deputy Chief Native Commissioner, Kenya) that unclaimed balances should be paid over to the tribal organisations to which the men belonged, and the Civil and Military authorities concurred. Ordinances were passed locally providing that such monies, remaining undisposed of for three years without any claim having been made, should be applied and made over for the benefit of the tribe to which the native belonged, and these Ordinances were approved in the Colonial Office as representing the most adequate arrangements which could be made.3. It must be admitted that there was an oversight on the part of the Colonial Office in this matter, as the expenditure involved would, to the extent of about nine-tenths, fall upon Imperial Funds, and the consent of the War Office should have been sought.When the oversight was brought to notice it was considered necessary to direct the repeal of the provision. The Governors protested strongly against the repeal, and it then appeared that the provision had been made after very careful consideration. It had been evident that the task of tracing the individuals entitled to the balances would require a large special organisation out of all proportion to the amount involyed, and Colonel Watkins had agreed to the alternative of payment to the tribes on that ground. If the alternative had not been accepted by the local representative of the War Office and provided by law, he would have felt compelled to press for the more elaborate investigation. [13184]
4. It is to be regretted that full information of the circumstances had not been furnished at the outset, as the question would certainly in that case have been referred to the War Office, and would have been considered on its merits without the further loss of time which necessarily tended to accentuate the difficulty of tracing individuals.5. On the receipt of the Governors&apos; protests, an effort was made to obtain the concurrence of the War Office and the Treasury in the arrangements originally contemplated. The arguments used by the Acting Governor of Kenya were that the arrangement was reasonable in view of the special tribal communal system existing in East Africa, by which any native having no resources is maintained by the tribe; the fact that in the Imperial Army sujh unclaimed balances are devoted to military charities, and do not revert to the Exchequer; and the fact, already mentioned, that the trouble was due to the failure of the Imperial military authorities to provide a special organisation for the administration of the Military Labour Corps.6. The representations of the Colonial Office failed, and the matter rested until Colonel Watkins came on leave in 1922 and raised it with some foi*ce. He considered that the failure to recognise the arrangement agreed to locally was definitely a breach of faith with him, in view of the fact that he had only accepted the proposal as an alternative to an exhaustive search for the individuals entitled to the payments. He desired to be allowed to enlist the influence of General Smuts (who had commanded in chief in East Africa), and was deterred from resigning, in order to draw public attention to the matter, only by the fact that Mr. Wood, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time, decided that a further effort should be made. Attention had already by that time been drawn to the subject in the House of Commons.7. In the further representations made to the War Office the question of payment to the tribes was reserved, and the Army Council were asked to agree to a determined effort being made to trace the individuals entitled to the balances. The War Office, however, refused to agree to any systematic effort being made to trace individual claims, and, while consenting to the payment of individual claims as presented, asked that the amount of the unpaid balances should be surrendered at once. Since then a few individual claims have come to light and have been paid, but the position has not materially altered since the returns made in 1922, of which an abstract accompanies this memorandum.8. Early in 1924, the late Governors of Tanganyika and Kenya again pressed for payment to the tribes to be approved. In the case of Kenya this would mean payment to the Native Trust Funds, which have now been set up. In the other Dependencies the respective Governors would&quot; be responsible for administering the money for the welfare of the tribes.9. The AVar Office and the Treasury were again approached, and Mr. Thomas also wrote semi-officially to Mr. Walsh and Mr. Snowden asking for their support. The matter was still outstanding when the present Government took office, and I took an early opportunity of impressing on my colleagues at the War Office and the Treasury that I was in complete accordance with my predecessor on this question. It had been hoped that, subject to the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a compromise might be effected by devoting  100,000 to this object out of the Army surplus which was anticipated, but the surplus was not realised, and, in addition, Mr. Churchill said that he could, in any case, only have consented on the condition of the Army Council agreeing to the payment in principle. This, it is understood, they felt themselves unable to do.10. The matter was brought to Mr. Ormsby Gore&apos;s attention when in Kenya last autumn, and this case was quoted as an example of the Imperial Government &quot; letting down &quot;: native interests. Protest against the retention of these balances by the Government has already been made in the local press in East Africa, and it is one of the allegations against the administration of Kenya made by Dr. Norman Leys in his book &quot; Kenya,&quot; which has attracted, and is certain again to attract, attention in the Houses of Parliament, where questions have already been asked on this subject, and outside. In view of the attitude embodied in the White Paper (Cmd. 1922) of 1923, His Majesty&apos;s Government stand to be attacked for a breach of their trusteeship for the natives. The operations could not have been carried on without the assistance of these large bodies of native carriers, who rendered loyal and invaluable service in circumstances always arduous and often dangerous, and there is no equitable justification for the Government retaining
the sums due to these men or their dependents. It is unfortunate that the balances could not have been paid over to the individuals to whom they were due, but it is impossible now for the Government to take up the attitude that their liability ended with the failure to trace the individuals, seeing that it has definitely refused to agree to a systematic search for them.11. In this connection it may be mentioned that His Majesty&apos;s Government have recently accepted a proposal from the German Government that facilities should be given to them to pay admitted claims by their ex-soldiers, carriers, &amp;c, in Tanganyika territory. It would be unfortunate if the readiness of their old masters to pay should cause the natives to make comparisons in the matter of good faith unfavourable to the British Administration.12. I sincerely hope that the Cabinet will agree to the full amount of the balances still unclaimed being re-voted, in order that they may be applied to the benefit of the tribes, and if my appeal is unsuccessful I do not see how I can answer any attacks which may be made, except by saying that the matter has been repeatedly pressed by my predecessors and myself but that it has not been found possible to secure the concurrence of the other Departments of State which are more closely concerned from the financial point of view.L.
