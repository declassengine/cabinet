[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesfry&apos;g Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   JuZy 1925.&apos;nOMFlDENTSAL LIBRARY,CONFIDENTIAL.1[L 3140]MEMORANDUM.EVERY other year an &quot;anti-alcoholic congress&quot; is held in different countries ; it has been the custom of His Majesty&apos;s Government, on being invited to send repre-sentatives by the Government in whose territory the congress is held, to appoint an &quot; observer &quot; (usually a secretary from the Embassy or Legation in such country), who is present at the congress, but is careful to avoid committing His Majesty&apos;s Government to any of the recommendations made by the congress.This year the congress will be held in September at Geneva, and the circumstances of the invitation are a little different from those which have prevailed hitherto. The invitation does not proceed from the Swiss Government, but from the &quot; International Bureau against Alcoholism,&quot; of which His Majesty&apos;s Government are not a member  though certain British institutions are.Further, the congress has slightly changed its form. It is this year to be a &quot; Conference of Experts,&quot; aud they are to discuss many questions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government are by no means anxious to express an opinion and into a discussion of which they are not anxious to be drawn, on account of their diplomatic delicacy.   These are : (a.) The question of alcohol in colonies and mandated territories, legislation inforce there, and reforms which might be introduced. (6.) Endeavours to put au end to alcohol smuggling by means of international conventions, with special reference to treaties concluded by the UnitedStates with maritime Powers and to an international convention on thesame subject proposed between the Baltic States., ((*.) The consideration of the question how it would be possible to prevent in thefuture the conflicts which have arisen of late between alcohol-exporting countries and other States which have either prohibited or restricted theimport and use of alcoholic beverages.The invitation from the Bureau came to the Foreign Office, who placed these considerations before the other Departments concerned (the Home Office, Colonial Office, Board of Trade and Ministry of Health), proposing that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should reply that, not being a member of the Bureau, they would not be represented at the approaching conference, and that if, as a result of this refusal, an invitation were received from the Swiss Government, then the same procedure should be adopted as in previous years, and a secretary from the Legation at Berne should be detached as an observer, with instructions to express no opinion on the matters debated, and in particular to refrain from committing His Majesty&apos;s Government on any of the controversial questions which will apparently be raised at the conference. All these Departments concurred in the course proposed.A. C.Foreign Office, June 30, 1925.[2947]   [13278]
