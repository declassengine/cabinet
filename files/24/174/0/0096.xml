667[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1925,SECRET.CP. 397 (25).CABINET,THE DISPUTE IN THE COAL MINING INDUSTRY.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I HAVE been struck by the good sense of this article, written quite indepen^ dently in this able financial paper, and I think it would be well worth perusal by my colleagues.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, August 11, 1925.The &quot; Statist,&quot; London, Saturday, August 8, 1925. The Coal Subsidy.IT must be confessed that critics of the last-minute action of the Government in the coal dispute are attacking the Cabinet from unfair vantage points. They do not appreciate the desperate extremity to which the Government were pushed, by force of circumstances, nor the limited character of the actual subvention proposed. The action of the Government cannot be judged fairly except on its own merits, and most of the arguments now being raised, which strike at the general principle of a State subsidy for industry, pass by the present issue. The general case for a subvention as a way out of the coal crisis was outlined in these columns last week. We must not be taken as being at all in favour of a State subsidy designed to bolster up uneconomic conditions in any industry. Nor in the present instance do we -contend that the Governments action is anything but an evil. It is unquestionably, however, vastly the lesser of two evils, the alternative being a coal stoppage, and that is half its justification. For the other half the subvention is justified by evidences of a recovery from the present abnormal trade depression that have recently appeared (as described below) evidences sufficiently strong to warrant the expectation that within a short time the coal subsidy may be rendered unnecessary.In regard to the first point raised above, doubtless even the most determined critic of the Governments action in the crisis must have felt relieved at the eleventh-hour announcement that a coal stoppage had been prevented, whatever his views on the actual terms of settlement. A coal stoppage at the present juncture would undoubtedly have been a national calamity. It might, indeed, have given a much-needed relief to the international coal markets, but it is the foreign pits, whose workers had refused a sympathetic strike, that, would reap the benefit. The world could easily do without British coal for a few months, and possibly, when eventually the home pits were reopened, owners and workers would find themselves ousted from many other markets abroad in addition to those they have lost already. In the home market coal substitutes would have been afforded a brilliant opportunity of establishing themselves more firmly. The collateral consequences of a coal stoppage might be even greater, especially on the iron and steel, engineering and shipbuilding industries, which are also in the throes of a crisis. The danger was greatly augmented by the plans of support to the miners prepared by organised labour in other industries.   At best, there would have been a great[13458]80
increase in unemployment. This alone would have entailed a heavy financial drain through the medium of Unemployment Insurance benefits and Poor Law relief. It is possible that the deficit in the Unemployment Insurance Fund would have been increased to a figure that destroyed all hope of the scale of contributions being reduced to normal before January next, when the burdens of the new pensions scheme become effective. It is more rhetorical than accurate to describe the Cabinet as,..having been blackmailed into a subsidy. If there was blackmail, the pressure came from intangible economic forces, and not from owners or workers. The owners were right, because the 1924 wage agreement was making coal production unprofitable; the &quot;miners were right because the effect of the owners&apos; proposals would, under the conditions obtaining in June and July, cause hardship. It simply happened most unfortunately that the time when the option to terminate the 1924 agreement was exercisable coincided with the trough period of a cycle of industrial depression.The foregoing, however, is only the weaker half of the case for the subvention. It derives its strongest justification from the prospects now appearing of a general revival in trade. The recovery has already commenced in some countries abroad, notably in America, where prices have risen on the average by 7 per cent, over the past three months. The British prioe-level had been falling month by month since the end of December last until July; our own calculations for the latter month are not yet complete, but the results to hand indicate a recovery at last. Already over the month of July there has been a very pronounced improvement in the unemploy-ment situation also, as shown in a later column. The reduction in the Bank of England&apos;s rate on Thursday last forms at once a help and an encouragement, and there is every reasonable ground for the belief that we are on the eve of a fresh period of active business, with rising prices. On that account we believe that the figures that have been mentioned as the probable cost of the coal subvention are much over the mark;  5,000,000 may, indeed, prove sufficient to cover the whole liability under-taken. This is, of course, assuming that the 1924 wage agreement will prove&apos;  contrary to what has so often been argued to be justifiable and practicable under a normal level of general trading prosperity, with a reservation against those pits that are likely to prove uneconomic even under fair conditions. It must be remembered that last years coal agreement has not had a fair trial, industry having been in a state of severe depression throughout most of the period of its operation. The Government subvention has come at the last moment to enable the agreement to be tested under what, as we hope, will be more normal conditions. The agreement must, however, stand or fall by that test; if it proves unworkable in reasonably fair weather, then any further justification for the subvention will have vanished.
