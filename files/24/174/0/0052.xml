CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;8 Government.SECRETPrinted for the Cabinet, July, 1925Copy No.   3 0CP. 353 (25)THE CABINETUNCLAIMED BALANCES OF PAY EARNED BY NATIVE MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY LABOUR CORPS DURING THE EAST AFRICA CAMPAIGNMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR WAR1. This question has been submitted for. the consideration of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 302 (25)).I must in the first place deprecate the re-opening of this question at all. The difficulty arose in the first instance from the error admittedly made by the ColonLl Office in authorizing the ordinances without reference to the other departments concerned. When the error was discovered, it was clearly desirable that if t;e ordinances were right in principle, though issued without proper authority, they should be upheld. The Colonial Secretary of the time, Lord Milner, gave instructions for their cancellation. When this action resulted in an appeal from the Governors, the matter was very fully considered and the appeal was refused by the War Office and the Treasury.In default of any entirely fresh considerations, this should have finally disposed of the question, and indeed when the Colonial Office reopened the matter in August, 1922, they made no attempt to press for the pajmient of the balances to the tribes, but merely asked the War Office to agree that the local Governments, without actually searching for claimants, should be requested to make it generally known that claims might still be preferred and to forward information as to the claims still outstanding. It was not until July. 1924, that the Colonial Office opened the whole matter afresh and pressed strongly for a reversal of the decision, reached after full discussion and with a knowledge of all the facts in 1921.I cannot agree that, at this distance of time, there are grounds for asking the Cabinet to reverse a decision, taken originally on the initiative of Lord Milner, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, and allowed by the Colonial Office, whether reluctantly or not, to stand till 1924.2. According to the latest figures the unclaimed balances now stand at approximately  155,000 (not  165,000 as stated in the first paragraph of the memorandum). But even surjposing the principle of payment were accepted, a claim to this sum could not fairly be established, as it includes balances of deserters as well as dead and missing carriers ; it is almost certainly inflated by overcredits to missing men or men who were-treated as missing, but continued to serve under other names ; and it makes no allowance-for the fact that considerable overpayments to carriers have also been written off as irrecoverable : these overpayments should clearly be taken into account if the interests of the individual and the community are to be considered as mergedo.There is no information in the War Office as to the agreement of the Military authorities (referred to in paragraph 2 of the Memorandum) to the transfer of unclaimed balances from Imperial Funds,&apos;but any such agreement was ultra vires and had no War Office authority behind it. .4. While, as stated in paragraph 7 of the Memorandum, the War Office objected, in 1921, to the engagement of a special staff, at an unknown but undoubtedly heavy cost to Imperial Funds, to search for individual claimants, no objection was raised to a proposal by the Colonial Office that the Governments of the Dependencies concerned should be01651738
requested to take such steps as would most effectively bring to the notice of the general population that claims might still be made, and arrangements have been made and will continue, at any rate for the present, at Imperial expense, to meet such claims as may be put forward.I think that what has been done to enable the money to be paid to those to whom it is due is all that can reasonably be expected, even allowing for the difficulties which existed in East Africa in raising and administering these corps, and I cannot admit any obligation to set up elaborate machinery to search out individual claimants.5. The statement in paragraph -5 of the memorandum that in the Imperial Army such unclaimed balances are devoted to military charities and do not &quot;revert to the Exchequer, needs qualification.The transfer of deceased soldiers&apos; unclaimed effects to the Royal Patriotic Fund is made under Act of Parliament (Regimental Debts Act, 1893) but it only applies to soldiers dying on service. There is nothimg to show how many of the natives here in question come into this category, and I can see no reason why the disposition of the whole fund should be determined by an analogy applicable only to an unknown fraction of.it. .6. It is not stated in paragraph 11 of the memorandum whether the G-erman Government are likely to offer to pay over to the Tribes any balances due to men who cannot be traced. If not, they can hardly be said to be more ready to pay than we are ; but should it appear likely that such an offer is contemplated, I presume it would be rightly regarded as an attempt on the part of the German authorities to spread disloyalty to the British Government among the natives and would be dealt with accordingly. I cannot regard this point as in any way relevant to the proposal under consideration.7. On the general merits of the case I cannot agree that the Tribes have any greater claim to this money than the British taxpayer from whose pockets it will have to come. The persons for whose benefit the money will be handed over cannot be identified with the individuals who earned it, and many of them doubtless took no part on our side in the war in which it was earned, even if they were not actively hostile to us. Admittedly, we shall have criticism whatever decision is taken, but I see no reason to anticipate that the criticism will be less strong, nor could I regard it as less well founded, if we give, as suggested, over  150,000 to those who have, at most, only a constructive claim to it, than if we refuse.8. I have made no provision for this service in 1925-26 Estimates, and if it is decided that payment should be made from Army Funds, I should, so far as I can at present foresee, be compelled to present a Supplementary Estimate to meet the cost. This is a course which, even were the merits of the case far stronger than they seem to me to be, I should be most reluctant to take. If, therefore, the Cabinet sanctions the payment, I think it should be borne on the Colonial Office Vote and that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should present and defend the Supplementary Estimate.L. W.-E.The War Office,l&amp;th July, 1925.
