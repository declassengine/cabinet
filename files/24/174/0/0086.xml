THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. .     &apos;     .pi 11 i........... i  i...........

Memorandum by the Pre aidant of the Board of Trade .The British Government hold 850,000  1 Preference Shares and 850,000  1 Preferred Ordinary shares in the British Dye stuffs Corporation, Limited,  the total Capital of which is  10,000,000 divided as follows4,500,000 Preference Shares of  1 each.4,500,000 Preferred Ordinary Shares of  1 each.1,000,000 Deferred Ordinary Shares of  1 each.The British Government have two Directors on the Board and a very strict power of veto, which, in effect prevents the Board from exercising a free direction of the commercial policy of the Company.     No other dye-making company In the United Kingdom is subject to similar controltIt was universally agreed many months ago that,  if the Company was to survive, it was essential that the management of the Company should be overhauled, and that the capital of the Company should be re-construeted with a drastic writing down of capital.In July of last year, the then President of the Board of Trade requested an informal Committee, presided over by Mr. McKenna and comprising representatives of the Company,  Colour Users and Chemical Manufacturers, to report on the Company.     The Committee were unable to agree as to the merits of a particular arrangement with the German manufacturers which had been
sj 2 9proposed, and to some provisions of which some of the Committee took exception.     All the members of the Committee, however, were in full agreement on three points affecting the management of the Company: (1) that there must be a. re-constitution of the management,  (2) that the Company should by some means or other be entirely free from Government control, (3) that there must be a reduction of capital. The committee were of opinion that the carrying out of the recommendation with regard to the new constitution of the Dyestuffs Corporation and the reduction of capital would put the Corporation on such a business footing as might inspire more confidence in the trade generally, but they thought that in no circumstances could the present system of partial Government control be satisfactorily worked and that the Government interest in the Company should be brought to a close.The Committee was an informal Committee and its Report was strictly confidential, and no public use can be made of it.   I should add that the colour users were expressing their own personal opinion and were not authorised to express the views of the Colour Users&apos; Association, but aa they were users of great influence, including the president of the Colour Users&apos; Association,  1 think it may be taken that their views would be shared by other users.The late Government agreed to the first and third of the above suggestions, but declined to part with their holding as this would have been an act of denationalisation, although I believe the President of the Board of Trade was  in favour of a sale.   Re-organisation was, in fact, as the Report indicated, dependent upon the removal of control;   and as a result the late Government did nothing,
After the present Government came in I succeeded, in agreement with the Board of the company, in securing the re-organisation of the Directorate and adding considerably to its strength.     Lord Ashfield became Chairman, Sir Alfred Mond became a Government Director, and Lord Colwyn   joined the Board.     The Company also succeeded in obtaining the services of an able Managing Director,   Dr. E.P. Armstrong.The Board at once proceeded to prepare for the necessary re-organisation.     The Board are unanimously of opinion that the re-organisation of the capital of the Company, which means a large writing down of capital and using liquid assets in new development, will be impossible, unless the Company is freed from Government control and Is as free as any competing dye-making company to pursue the commercial policy which it regards as most advantageous. In this decision the Cabinet will see that the Board, in the light of its experience, is at one with the McKenna Committee.The Treasury and I have discussed methods with the Board;   and we are all agreed that the only way effectively to remove Government control is for the Government to cease to be a shareholder.     So long as the Government remains a shareholder, we could not guarantee the company the freedom which It requires.     Moreover, in addition to the fact that control cannot be parted with unless the Government sells its shares, the sale of Government shares is politically much the easiest way of parting with the control.     The Treasury and the Board of Trade are therefore agreed as to the policy which ought to be pursued.The Treasury have been advised as to the price they ought to receive for their shares by   Sir William   McLintock
The Treasury are anxious to obtain the full market value of the day if they can.    The preolse price is, however, a matter of detailj and we are in agreement on principle and polioy.The issue of polioy is whether the Company is to be free to pursue the polioy whioh the new Board regard as vital, and whether the Board is to be free to propose to the shareholders the only scheme of reconstruction whioh the Board can honestly recommend.    If the Board and the Company are not given this freedom, the alternative might well be the liquidation of the Company.    Such a course would, I need hardly say, he admitting the complete failure of the whole dyestuffs policy.The Company will agree that a provision should be inserted in the Memorandum and Articles that the Company shall never pass under foreign control.   The Company will be free to make arrangements with foreign companies just as the other dye companies in this country are at present.1 have always held the view that a satisfactory arrange-ment of this kind is desirable. I am also satisfied that, under its present management,  there is no real risk of the Board making agreements, whioh are not in the best interests of the Company and are not of a thoroughly businesslike characterj and that there is no risk of the Board making an agreement by which the Company would sacrifice its manufacturing powers in order to beoome a merchanting organisation.In these circumstances, I am convinced that the course proposed is the only one whioh is open to us if this Company is to continue, and that it is a course which is in the best interests of dye manufacture in this country.(intd.) P.C-L.Board of Trade,6th August,  1925.
