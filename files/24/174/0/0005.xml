CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY, . .      39(TEI3 POCUMSflg 13 TF5 PROPERTY OP HIf! BRIT \P&quot;MC MAJESTY/S  GOVERNMENT)S E 0 R 5 T.&quot; C A BIKE T.CMP. 305  (25). &quot;     &apos;g?UE IROIJ \ND STEEL XNTSCJHTRY.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.Apart from the question whether a duty or a bounty in favour of the steel industry would lead to general protection which would be ineonsistent with  our pledges so far as the present Parliament is concerned,, there is one aspect  of the case put before us by the industry to which I should like to call the attention of my colleagues.      In this Industry it appears from the figures submitted to us that the average wage per week of the British workman Is  3.3.7;  of the German   ,1.5; of the Belgian  1.16.6;   of the Prench  1.13.11.      Moreover the French and the Belgians have a more liberal allowance of overtime and the Germans, for a great part of the industry,  though not for all, have a ten-hour as against our eight-hour day,      In other words,  taking all these figures into consideration, the foreign workman costs something between a half and two-thirds what a British workman costs on the average and even if some further allowance must be made for the superior excellence of the British workman hour for hour, which may or may not be the case, the difference remains startling.It appears to me to be vital that we.should do nothing which shall disguise from the country the significance of these figures  or mislead the  industry into the belief that any fiscal change that we can bring about will compensate for theta-      Last Wednesday we resolved in the case of the coal industry that nothing would be more unfortunate than that State intervention should, prevent employers and employed from realising the full bearinp of the labour bill upon the cost of production.
r&apos;e said they must work out their own sal rat ion and any action of ours which might prevent them from looking facts in the face would he disastrous.      If the figures which I have set  out at the beginning of this note mean what I imagine they mean, then what is true of the coal industry Is true to a greater or lesser extent of the steel industry likewise.      Moreover, there is this further inference to be made, that not only will raising-prices in the steel industry react unfavourably .on all other industries   to which  cardinal fact sufficient attention has already been called   but in this specific matter of the coal crisis the coal workers v.ill draw the worst conclusion from any intervention of tan  Government in the steel industry..    In their view cur intervention in    ne case will be the necessary prelude to our intervention in coal as well, and therefore by taking fiscal - action in the steel Industry we should do the very thing which we determined to avoid doing last Wednesday,  namely, retard In the coal crisis the realisation of the facts, which is the  only hope of a solution..Therefore, unless there is some answer to this argument which may well be the  case   my conclusion would be that whether we have an enquiry into the position of the steel industry or not we should hold out no hopes whatever that by any fiscal advantage we would alter the conditions of . employment there-    Those engaged in industry must realise that in a country v/hioh depends upon its export trade,   if the costs of production are greater than the costs of production of its competitors,  the only remedy is, either by lower wages or longer hours or better work-or improved  organisation,  to reduce the cost of production.I need not say that in Industries where the difficulties are purely temporary these arguments y ould not apply nor would
q 9werethey be conclusive even v-hore, though the cif difficulties/likely to be somewhat longer, the industry was  of relatively small importance, but in the steel, industry I have no reason to suppose that the adverse conditions as to labour are temporary: and having regard to the vital importance of the trade v.-e shall never be forgiven if. ??e do not speak the truth to the c ount ryv(Int c.. )June 23rd 1925.
