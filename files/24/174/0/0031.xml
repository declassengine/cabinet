(W 63/77/3^/28).Draft Note to the French and Spanish Ambassadors. .Foreign Office,July , 1925.Your Excellency,I have laid before His Majesty&apos;s Government the papers and observations which were communicated to me by your Excellency and the Spanish/French Ambassador on the subject of the resolutions adopted by the Franco-Spanish Conference at Madrid.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have given their most serious consideration to the suggestion of the French and Spanish Governments, both on account of their close friendship with the Governments from which they emanate and of the high importance which His Majesty&apos;s Government attach to the safety and Integrity of the international zone.    The two Governments have proposed that: (1) British naval forces should co-operate in the suppress-ion of contraband traffic in arms, and ammunition in Moorish waters;. (2) contingents of British, French and Spanish troops should be despatched to the Tangier zone to prevent supplies of all kinds reaching the rebels and if necessary to protect the town itself; (3) the Mendoub at Tangier should be instructed to hand over to the Spanish authorities any natives of the Spanish zone who may escape into the internation-al. zone; (4) the natives in the Fahs shouldbe
&quot;be disarmed..  2..  His Majesty&apos;s Government, in fulfil-ment of their obligations under article 4 of the Tangier Convention, are prepared to co-operate in the surveillance and prevention of contraband traffic within the territorial waters of Tangier.     It must however be re-member ed that as neither the Italian, United States or Portuguese Governments have acceded to the Tangier Convention and as those Powers enjoy extra-territorial rights in the inter-national zone, it will be impossible to detain or search vessels flying the flags of those countries, and it is for consideration whether in these conditions, the surveillance can be made sufficiently effective to be of use.3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it inexpedient that they should participate in any action in the territorial waters of the French and Spanish zones.     They observe that in the Franco-Spanish explanatory memorandum of June 30th it is stated that surveillance will be carried out normally &quot;a 1*interieur des eaux territoriales qui sont de 6 raill.es0; and further, that surveillance - will be carried out within lines drawn from Cap dos Trols Fouches to Cap Negro end from points 6 miles to the west of Cap Ghir and Cap Noun respective ly.    His Majesty&apos;s Government must place on. record at once their inability to accept the above statement as to the extent of territorial waters, or to admit the claim to exercisesurveillance
surveillance &quot;beyond a 3-mile limit from low-water mark.     The principle of the 3 mile limit is expressly recognised in the Anglo-American Liquor Traffic Convention to which Your Excellency has referred and His Majesty&apos;s Government feel unable to sanction tacitly or by implication&apos; any infringement of a principle which they have consistently maintained for many years.4o     His Majesty1s Government are convinced that the despatch of conting-ents of troops to Tangier at the present moment would be fraught with grave danger,     In their considered opinion, which is entirely supported by His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Tangier in a report received by me since my last interview with Your Excellency; such action, &quot;far from averting an attack on the zone by the rebels, would probably provoke it.     Further, it would almost certainly lead to international corn-plications which must add to the difficulties of a situation which is already sufficiently embarrassing.   It is hardly necessary to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government would entertain even stronger objections to the despatch of French and Spanish contingents only or of a Spanish contingent alone, with -out ...
v/ithout the presence of a British contingent, and. that the danger to Tangier from such action would be indefinitely increased05,     So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are awa,re there are no substantial grounds for believing that Abdel Krim contemplates an attach on the international zone provided that its neutrality be strictly observed; and His Majesty!c Government do not antici-pate that he will deliberately embroil him-self with all the powers who have acceded to -the Tangier convention and who are in the last resort jointly responsible for the safety of the zone     Once only have rebel forces crossed the frontier in order to protect unarmed tribesmen from ambush within the Tangier zone, and it is to be observed that no hostile acts were committed by them on that occasion,     The heads of the tribes were at once warned of.the consequences of any repetition of the incident and they sent satisfactory assurances; which hove since been scrupulous1y reepected:6.     The establishment of a cordon --within the limits of the zone and indeed any attempt to close the frontier on the Tangier side would almost inevitably be considered by Abdel Krim as involving Tangier in the struggle now in progress outside the international zone, and His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but fear that it would.1. o    O    It.........................Mil- IIWIIIIIB.....MllilMllllWMMIIIMIllWBWMIIlim nl &apos; n 111111.....1&apos; 1.......11 i l&quot;T
4 Q 9L iJ fcjdraw upon the Tangier zone the very attack which it is the object of all Powers con-cerned to avert.     It is, moreover, diffi-cult to see what real advantage would he gained even if the frontier were successfully closed and all ingress and egress rendered impossible.     Tangier depends on the Jebala tribes for provisions, especially chickens, eggs and vegetables, and I understand that Tetuan is to a large extent provisioned from Tangier.     The loss of these supplies would inevitably increase still further the high cost of living at Tangier and inflame the discontent which unfortunately prevails there.     The tribesmen would be unable to obtain the small quantities of sugar and tea which they now receive in exchange for their produce;   but, as they have gathered their harvest and have summer fruits and honey, they would suffer less than the inhabitants of the zone.     Certainly it would hot be sufficient to force the tribesmen to sur-render*     As regards war material, it appears, according to the information which has reached His Majesty&apos;s Government, that no supplies of this kind are reaching Abdel Krim through the port of Tangier;  -but the Administration would no doubt be ready to arrange that all natives leaving Tangier for the Spanish zone should besearched ...

The conclusion to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are forced is-that any attempt to close the frontier from the Tangier side will have a negligible effect on the rebels and. cannon hasten the restoration of peace, while by provoking an attack on Tangier it might have the gravest consequences and produce a situation the result of which cannot be foreseen.7.    His Majesty Is Government agree that Tangier cannot be allowed to become a centre and focus of intrigue and rebellion against the authorities of the French and Spanish zones.     They have no evidence that this is the case.     Should it be so, how-ever, the necessary powers are in the hands of the Administration, under article 29 of the convention, which provides for the expulsion of both foreigners and natives ..by the Mendoub.     His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General will support his colleagues in sotting the appropriate machinery in force in all cases where the offence is proved.     On the other hand, apart from 6,000 refugees, there are several hundred natives from the Spanish -zone residing in Tangier.     To round up and hand over these natives to the Spanish authorities would be a physical impossibility for the Tangier Administration.     Nor can His Majesty&apos;s Government perceive whatadvantage ....
advantage would be gained by so doing.   It would not seriously hamper Abdel-Krim and it would certainly exasperate a great many people.8,     The disarmament of the natives in the Pahs, that is to say, throughout the international zone except the town of Tangier itself, also presents great physical difficulties.     There are in the zone some sixty-five villages.     To a native his rifle, is his greatest treasure.     Sooner than surrender it, he would cross the frontier and join the rebels,     No more unpopular measure could be devised, and the present crisis is not the moment for unpopular measures.     Later on, when the Administra-tion is more firmly established, gradual disarmament of the natives may be possible, but it seems quite impracticable now,9,     It is a noteworthy fact that the International Administration of Tangier have made, no appeal to the Powers for the despatch of troops or for the other suggest-, ed measures of protection.     The inference would seem to be that the local authorities do not consider such action advisable. His Majesty1s Government desire to suggest that at the present juncture it would he wise to be guided, largely by the views and wishes of the International Administration,
and that any Interference with their discretion should be reduced to a minimum.10.    His majesty&apos;s Government recognise, however, that it is necessary to be prepared for the possibility that a   -situation might arise calling for joint action on the part of the three Powers in defence of the integrity of Tangier, and they agree that the necessary consultation should take place &quot;between the competent military authorities of the three countries. They understand that there has already been some informal interchange of opinion in London and they have given directions to the War Office to continue these conversa-tions.11;.-    I am addressing a similar note to the Spanish/French Ambassador.
