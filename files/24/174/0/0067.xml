[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, sPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1 925SECRET.O.P. 368 (25).MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.I tifink my colleagues may like to know that it is proposed to recommend the appointment in. the autumn of a Royal Commission on Indian Currency aad Finance.The appointment of an authoritative Committee to review this subject was foreshadowed in an announcement which was made in the Legislative Assembly in India last January by the Viceroy in the following terms :-.-&quot; The Government of India have been in communication with the Secretary of State on the subject of the rupee exchange, and the intention of Government is to appoint an authoritative Committee to consider the question as soon as world economic factors appear sufficiently stable to justify formulation of a new policy. In their judgment there is much to be gained by postponing an enquiry till those factors on which any decision must rest are less fluid and obscure. But they anticipate that if the movement towards more stable conditions, which has lately manifested itself, continues, the appointment of such a Committee should be possible not later than 12 months hence.&quot;I discussed this question fully with Lord Reading before he left, and we were both of opinion that, on a review of the existing situation, and having regard to the stabilisation of the sterling-dollar exchange, the time was now ripe for the authoritative Committee on Indian Currency to be set tip, and that it was extremely desirable that the enquiry should be conducted by a Royal Commission, a course for Avhich there are, of course, precedents.The terms of reference proposed are as follows : &quot; To examine and report on the Indian exchange and currency system and practice, to consider whether any modifications are desirable in the interests of India, and to make recommendations.&quot;With the approval of the Prime Minister, I have invited Mr. Hilton Young to allow his name to be submitted for -the Chairmanship of the Commission, and have obtained his consent. It is proposed that the remainder of the personnel shotild consist of five Europeans and four Indians, containing, of course, representatives of Banking and Commercial interests. It is-intended that the Commission should begin work in October and hold sittings both in this country and in India.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.27th July 1925.544      100   7.25
