lHls document is the property of his britahnic majesty&apos;s government.IbCJETj. CABINET. ^ CPI,P.366 (25).UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY AND TRADE REVIVAL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet have undertaken to consider, in relation to tho finance available, the comparative value and urgency of a number of proposals designed or calculated to relieve unemployment. Hitherto there has been a tendency year by year to approve specifics, often expensive and uneconomic, because they were obvious temporary palliatives in a passing emergency.    In our present review, I think we should go deeper? and concentrate, as far as wo can, on those lines of policy which, v/hile affording temporary relief, will directly lead to an increase of normal trade.   Moreover, it is important to combine specifics with general policy and relate the ono to the other.    In this way tho country will see that we have a cumulative policy designed to achieve a definite end, the revival of British trade. S The chief aim of unemployment schemes should be toincrease normal trade through normal channels.   This means -(l) Trying to secure for British industry a larger share of existing trade in both home and oversea market3.(2) The creation of new trade by the developmentof new markets. The two are Interdependent.    The more we sell in exioting market.:;, home and overseas,  the better our trade balance, and the more capital there is available for the development of new markets.The country .is becoming alive to the serious excess of imports over exports.    I think we ought to use this situation-1-
to the utmost in order to create and stimulate the will to buy British goods; and that this appeal should be based on a simple and sustained explanation of the trade position. For this a steady oampaign is needed, mobilising all methods of propaganda.   It is a national appeal, .in which everyone, irrespective of party,  could be invited to take part.   As a party, we should make It a definite plank in our programme and use the whole weight of the party machine in a non-partisan way,     Broadcasting should be usedj towns should be appealed to by their local Members to organise special selling weeks; and there should be constant articles over a long period in the Press.The Federation of British Industries has applied to the Government to devote a sum of  1,000,000 to a general campaign in favour of buying British goods.    I believe that expenditure on any groat scale la unnecessary, and that the suggestions put forward by the Federation of British Industri are very looso.   The weight which a Government and a party can bring to bear in a propagandist effort,  calling to its aid all thoso who can help,is so great, that any expenditure of Government money ought not to be large.    I think, for example, that, if the Government assisted financially in such ways as by the necessary grant to. re-atart the British Industries Fair, and by some assistance to special schemes of co-operative selling drfcvas, organised and financed by individual industries in particular markets, it would probably be unnecessary to draw on State finance for goneral propaganda.    On the other hand, I attach the greatest importance to such intensive propaganda in order to create the determination in the country to make a great voluntary effort to help its own industries.While I think the demand of the Federation of British Industries for general advertising expenditure unjustifiable,
I am bound to say that I have met with a large and increasing demand that British manufactures should receive something equivalent to the  1,000,000 grant to the Imperial Economic Committee.    I think action on the lines I suggest would meet this demand at the lowest possible cost.The counterpart to creating a desire to buy British goods is   some method of ensuring to the consumer that he is, in fact, carrying out his desire.   For this purpose I propose that next Session, as one of our principal measures, we should introduce a Merchandise Marks Bill dealing with industrial products, British agricultural products and Empire products.    The Cabinet has already approved this as regards agriculture; and I have reason to believe that the coming report of the Imperial Economic Committee will make definite recommendations for the marking of Empire produce.Next I would propose the adoption of specific subsidies for special contracts - a proposal which is being considered by the Committee of Civil Research,    I believe this to be both cheaper  end sounder than much of the work which we are subsidising Local Authorities to do, or the building of new roads, &apos; The Safeguarding of Industries should be given effect to up to the full limit of our pledges ,.   As analogous to this, the Cabinet will, I think, be interested to learn, that I have recently received a unanimous request from the shipping industry to prepare, and if necessary enforce, a policy of retaliation against foreign shipping in British ports, in order to secure national treatment for British ships in foreign ports.   The form of retaliation proposed by the shipowners is to double the tonnage dues levied on foreign ships in British ports.   The Free Trade conscience is developing a convenient elasticity.
We should speed up, as much as possible, railway construction and other development in the Empire, particularly in Africa.      I am convinced that nationally the most remunerative expenditure we can incur is in the development of markets which will be complementary and not competitive.     Africa fulfils this condition in a peculiar degree, and is at the same time the great potential source of supply of raw cotton.     The Prime Minister has already received a special report from the Balfour Committee urging the Immediate construction of.railways in the cotton-giving areas.May I suggest too that a substantial loan for Crown Colony development supplies a positive and convincing alternative to the persistent demand of the Socialist Party for loans to Russia.In connection with the provision of credit and the utilisation of credit to the best industrial advantage, the Cabinet will,I hope, soon have the report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research.     If it is necessary to continue the restriction of foreign issues, thus reversing our traditional policy, the possibility of coupling the restriction with some preference in favour of issues, which will carry the prompt  -placing of industrial orders, deserves careful consideration.Electricity is the subject of a special report of the Cabinet Committee,     Expenditure on this head is clearly of an economic order.Expenditure on agriculture, in so far as it increases.the output of food, reduces Imports and Improves the trade balance.     Industry Is therefore benefited by the increasedamount available for investment due to the diminution ofimports;    and where the development carries with it theerection of factories - as in sugar beet - the benefit isdirect as well as Indirect.Expenditure under all the above heads conforms to the-4-
test I have ventured to put, namely, increasing normal trade through normal channels.      If these lines are, asI believe them to be, both economically sound and popularand relate palliatives to a definite permanent policy,I suggest we should lay down our policy on these lines andtreat other demands of the nature of artificial and non-revenueproducing work as less urgent.(Intld.)    P.G-L.Board of Trade, 27th July,  1925.
