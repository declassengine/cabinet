HIS DOCUMENT I  THE^ PRO PERT Y OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY*S GOVERNMENT.)S..LLLLI&apos;P.,P.583(25) .copy no,   nfUCABINS T. THE COAL CRISIS. Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal,Though I do not yet know the precise conditions of the Government subsidy to the coal industry, it is, in the circumstances, urgont that wo should appreciate the broad outlines of the position in which we are placed.In the first place It is material hot to under-rate the amount of money to which we may be committed; the estimate of the difference we shall have to find per month until next May is, of course,  one of the elements of which I have not yet any precise information, but we ought to realise that the subsidy is most unlikely to finish by that date&quot;.     Though the Commission will probably n&apos;ot suggest that there is in reorganisation any complete remedy yet improvements they will certainly recommend, and the case for going on with the subsidy until the Improvements have had time to take effect is not likely to be resisted.This leads at once to the conclusion that thetemporary character of the subsidy, after perhaps a yearand a half or two years -continuous payment, will be seriously undermined.     Be the period, however, short orlong, while it continues, the Government must,  in Its own interest, exercise a controlling oversight over theindustry, and the longer the period is, the deeper will theroots of national oversight have struck into the.system.But apart from this, in view of the precedent we are nowto set, it is surely evident that no Government couldasain willingly be placed in our position,  i.o. In a-1-
capital    industrial dispute leaving the parties to make bungle after bungle until Government intervention is held to be inevitable, and the incidental loss,  to the tune of many millions,  is wrung from the Exchequer;    it follows,  therefore that in  future,  the Government will have to intervene,  not at the end but at the beginning of the dispute.      In other words in a crisis, Government control and Government financial responsibility must begin at once..     And if, in a crisis, why not in the management of the industry which leads up to a crisis?The conclusion from these premises seems to be inevitable:    as regards industries in difficulties     at any rate important industries - the precedent we are sotting leads straight to nationalisation.&apos;I need not say that to a Government pledged as we are,  this conclusion is absolutely unacceptable, even if such a policy were feasible.      But it is not feasible, because obviously the coal industry cannot be treated,  even if our pledges allowed it, as exceptional.     What should we have to  say to steel,  or shipbuilding,  or agriculture?If our present policy leads to nationalisation and this is unacceptable,  at what point are we going to draw the line.      Is there any grcamd on which,  in our retreat, we could hope to make a stand:    and if there be such a ground,  which I do not perceive,  have we the strength to hold it?     Eave we any longer the credit to hold it?     Por good reason or bad we have retreated because we did not venture to fight.     We have not only thought it right to give way to force, but wo have condoned the breaking of their contracts by the allied unions in their threatened sym -pathetic strike, and we have actually agreed to pay a large, sum for the arrangement,       Whatever our own ultimate intentions may be, there is no doubt that this is how the
&apos;Irades Unions themselves and the world regard the event. Who will believe us, after the  experience of the last few days, when we say we will die in some ill-defined ditch, rather than accept the nationalisation of the ooal industry,  and in fere nti ally, the nationalisation of every other distressed industry?I shall he only too glad if my confidence can be restored, but tho moral baa is of the Government seems to me to have dropped out.3*4th August, 1925.
