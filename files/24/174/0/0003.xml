CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARYIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT.BANKRUPTCY AND COMPANIES WIKDIHG-UP (PEES) BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum which was issued by my predecessor to his colleagues in July last, on the subject of this Bill.    It was recommended by the Labour Government&apos;s Home Affairs Committee, and decided by the Cabinet, that; subject to the concurrence of the Law Society - which was subsequently obtained, - the Bill should be taken in the Autumn Session of 1984.Owing to the Dissolution, the Bill was not Introduced; but, as it does not seem likely to be controversial, and as the Treasury, as well as the Board of Trade, are desirous that it should be passed, I suggest that the Bill should be referred to the Home Affaire Committee with a view to being passed in the Autumn Session of this year.CABINET.303(2F ) .(Home Affairs Committee).(Intd.)

THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.CP.372  (24). CABINET.(Home Affairs Committee).BANKRUPTCY AND COMPANIES WINDINQ-UP  (FEES) BILL.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.At present, owing to the wording of section 90 (5) of the Bankruptcy Act, 1914, and Section 220 (3) of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1^08, the administrative fees charged in bankruptcy and in companies winding-up can only be applied to pay the costs of the bankruptcy and companies administration respectively; and in fixing the fees, account has to be taken of the interest on so much of the sums standing to the credit of the Bankruptcy Estates Account and the Companies Liquidation Account as are invested from time to time.   Maintaining separate accounts has caused Inconvenience in the past, as special circumstances may temporarily affect the costB or receipt^ of one branch of insolvency administration or the other-, and the fees have to be altered accordingly.For the last few years the bankruptcy fees and interest on investments have been insufficient to meet the cost of administration.    On the other hand in the case of companies liquidation there has been a considerable profit, owing chiefly to the interest on various balances.Bankruptcy fees have been increased up to the limit of what is considered reasonable.   The fees In companies
liquidation, however, have-not been increased since the beginning of the war, and the cost of liquidation of a company by an Official Receiver is now much less than that of liquidation by an outside liquidator.    I do not think this is desirable.It is true that there may be some criticism of the Bill on the ground that to increase fees in company liquidation is to take more money from traders, and on an occasion when they have already suffered loss through a company going into liquidation, but there is much to be said for treating insolvency as a whole in this respect, and for having the Board of Trade company liquidation fees on a scale comparable with that paid to outside liquidators.    It is accordingly proposed by the present Bill, both to merge the two accounts into one, and also to provide generally that the fees shall be based on the costs of administration.Clause 1 provides for the payment of the bankruptcy fees and investments dividends and the companies fees and invest-ments dividends into one account, for the payment out of the account of the costs of administration, and for the payment into the Exchequer of any balance at the close of the financial year, after deducting an amount equal to one-half of the amount paid out during that year.    The last provision will enable a sum of some  160,000 at present standing to the credit of the companies foes account to be released and paid into the Exchequer.Clauso 2 provides for fixing the fees so as to meet the costs of administration.Clause 3 provides for the presentation to Parliament of a single ^annual account instead of the two now presented.Clause 4 applies the Act to the fees charged and the costs
incurred in administering the Deeds of Arrangement Act, which are at present dealt with in the same way as bankruptcy fees.Clause 5 and the Schedule effect the necessary repeals.The Bill was prepared at the suggestion of the Treasury, and. they concur in its terms.    Although, as-I have said, there is one ground of possible criticism that I see, there ought to be no great difficulty in passing the Bill through its various stages; and I should be glad if it could be referred to the Home Affairs Committee now, with a view to Its introduction and passage if possible before the end of the Autumn Sitting.(Intd.)

Bankruptcy and Companies Winding-up (Fees) Bill.MEMORANDUM.At present the administrative fees charged in the two classes of insolvency, viz.: bankruptcy and com-panies winding-up, can only he applied to pay the costs of the bankruptcy and companies administration respec-tively. It is proposed by the present Bill to amalgamate the two accounts so as to avoid, as far as possible, the necessity of altering fees to meet temporary variations in the costs or receipts of one administration or the other. It is also proposed to repeal the provisions under which account has to be taken of the interest on so much of the sums standing to the credit of the Bankruptcy Estates Account and the Companies Liquidation Account as are invested from time to time, and to provide generally that the fees shall be based on the costs of administration.It is proposed further to apply the Bill to the fees charged and the costs incurred in administering the Deeds of Arrangement Act, which are at present dealt with in the same way as bankruptcy fees.
