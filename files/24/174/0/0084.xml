3NFIDSNTIAL I.....IBRAh   - -JXCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQVERIuIEKT) .0 R E T. p gfc385  (25 K&quot;     &quot;  &quot; CABINET,THE IRAQ, FRONTIER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies *The Boundary Commission appointed by the Council of the League of Nations in pursuance of Article 3 of the Treaty of Lausanne to examine the question of the Iraq frontier has now presented its Report.      The gist of the final conclusion of that Report is that the weight of economic and geographical arguments, as well as the sentiments of the majority of the inhabitants of the territory taken as a whole, operate in favour of the union with Iraq of the whole territory south of the &quot;Brussels line&quot;  (i.e0  the present frontier )6 This conclusion, which is in effect the acceptance of our case in its entirety, is subject to the following conditions: &quot;(l)    The territors?- must remain under the effectivemandate of the League of Nations for a period whichmay be put at twenty five years; (2)   Regard must be paid to the desires expressed by theKurds that the administration of the Kurdish areas should be conducted by Kurdish officials in theKurdish language.&quot; If on the other hand all League of Nations&apos; control were to cease on the expiry of the four years treaty between us and Iraq in the summer of 1928, and if no guarantees of local administration were given to the Kurds, then they believe that the majority of the population would prefer Turkish to Arab - sovereign!ty, adding that they also consider that it would be more advantageous for the territory to remain under the
sovereignity of Turkey &quot;whose internal conditions and external political situation are incomparably more stable than those of Iraq.&quot;.      In that event feeling that &quot;it would be to some advantage that the disputed, area should not be partitioned&quot; they would gixre the whole of the hosul vilayet to Turkey, reserving; only for Iraq a small portion in the region of the upper Diala which is necessary for carrying out the irrigation schemes on that river0When the Council of the League meets on September 2 we shall have to be prepared to give a definite answer to the question whether or not we are prepared to continue to be responsible to the League for the next twenty five years for the existence in the Vilayet of fcosul of a reasonable measure of decent government - at least up to the Turkish standard.      This does net mean, necessarily,  that  we should continue to exercise any specific measure of direct administrative control over the area in question or over Iraq as a whole, nor that we should maintain either the administration or defence of the country at the expense of the British taxpayer.      It does mean that we cannot say that we wash our hands completely of Iraq and take no further interest in its affairs after 1928, but that we are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the present treaty, to replace it by a further treaty which will enable us to exercise our influence on the Iraq Government as to the general character of its administration in the Mosul region,,Leaving aside for a moment the alternatives to the continuance of our influence, the conclusions of the Commissioners, if somewhat crudely put and couched in exaggerated terms, are substantially the same as those which I laid before the Cabinet on my return from Iraq in my
Memorandumon &quot;The situation in Iraq&quot; - (CP, 235 (25)). In that paper I expressed the conviction that for a considerable time to come, not only the security and administrative efficiency of the Iraq otate, but also its internal cohesion, are intimately dependent on the maintenance of the British connexion, and that the creat-ve work of nation building which we have carried so far and on such sound lines would be undone by any complete withdrawal in the near future of our influence and control.      This and all the other fsctors of the situation led me - and this was the view of all, British or Iraqi,    with whom I discussed the situation on the spot -    to the definite conclusion that the present treaty will have to be replaced before 1928 by one framed on lines more   suitable for permanent co-operation, both from the point of view of Iraq and from that of the British Government and British, taxpayer.    I defined my conception of the general character of such a treaty as follows:-&quot;Such a new treaty ought not to involve - at any rate not after a brief initial period - any further British expenditure on Iraq for Iraq purposes.      It ought certainly to reserve to -he British Government the right to maintain forces, and that means primarily, and probably exclusively, air forces, in Iraq at whatever strength it may consider desirable on general grounds of Imperial strategy, and to receive some contribution from Iraq for any portion of those forces which may be asked to do purely local Iraq work
It ought feo secure a sufficient measure of control to the High Commissioner to enable    him to safeguard the interests of Kurdish,  Assyrian and other minorities,  as well as to ensure that the general administration of public affairs should continue to be such as to afford reasonable protection to foreign commerce and investment.&quot;In effect then the Commission are only asking us to state now that,  in return for the frontier which we have claimed, we mean to do what I am convinced we should have had to do in any case,  even if our claim had been recognise! unconditionally.      I suggest that all we need say to the Council of the League is that before the present treaty expires we propose, as provided in that treaty,  to replace it by one of longer duration which will safeguard in the Mosul vilayet those conditions of reasonable good government and consideration for local sentiment, subject to which the Commission evidently con-sider that the present frontier is   the right one.It remains to consider the alternatives.      One is that the League of Nations responsibility should continue,  but under some other mandatory, presumably France.      I doubt if France would now be willing,  I am certain that British public opinion would object.      As for the effect on Arab opinion,  still very bitter over our partition of Syria and Palestine with the Vrench,  it would be disastrous.      The other alternative, that of cession to Turkey, would mean the destruction of all the admirable work of creative administration that we have carried on in  the province, work which is now on the eve
of bearing its fruit in a steady increase of revenue and prosperity. &apos;    It would mean disaster to the inhabitants, both to the Kurds whom the furies are now busily engaged in stamping out as a race in furkish Kurdistan, and to the Christian minorities.      It would make the position in  the  rest of Iraq frankly impossible,  and the whole edifice which w e have so laboriously and successfully ejected would come tumbling down,      Por if Iraq, with the northern province, is not likely to be stable without the British connexion,  that will be even more true of Iraq   without Mosul and with the Turk within a few marches - and an liour*s flight - from Baghdad.      The loss in prestige would be incalculable.      But we should have sacrificed not only our reputation for constancy and , honour,  but the  great position, commercial,  political and strategical, whioh we have built up for ourselves and of which, within a few years, we shall begin to reap the positive advantages.L.S.A.August 3rd 1925.
