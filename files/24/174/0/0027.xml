W.-E.The War Office,6th July, 1925.1. Under the Bill, a sailor or soldier is entitled to his pension for service or disability from Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, or Ministry of Pensions, plus the Bill pension in full at 65. The widow of a sailor or soldier who dies a natural death while serving or after discharge is entitled to service pension plus widow&apos;s pension in full. The number of such widows is small.There is unanimity among all Departments concerned on this part of the question.2. Clause 24 of the Bill proposes that the widow of a sailor, soldier, etc., whose death is attributable to naval, etc., service, whether war or post-war, shall receive a widow&apos;s &quot; service &quot; pension plus the amount, if any, by which the Bill widow&apos;s pension exceeds the service pension, i.e., in effect whichever pension is the greater, but not both.It applies to both war pension (Ministry of Pensions) and post-war pensions (the three Service Departments).   The widow&apos;s children are similarly dealt with.3. The three Service Departments object to this clause and consider that both pensions should be paid in full in the case of future widows and their children, whether&apos; war widows or post-war widows.4. A compromise has been proposed by Minister of Health which will give instead of full Bill pension (10s. a week), a pension of 2s. 6d. a week for widows originating up-to 1932, 5s. a week for widows originating up to 1937, 7s. Qd. orginating up to 1942,. 10s. for those originating thereafter. Those drawing 2s. Qd. will not rise to 5s. in 1937, and so on.The underlying principle of this scale is that the amount payable rises with the number of contributions paid, by the husband before his death.Children are to get in effect either service or Bill pension, whichever is greater, but not both.This is in substitution for a previous proposed compromise of service pension plus half Bill pension for widows and children.5. The Service Departments do not accept this compromise and press for full pensions for future widows and-children. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to adhere to the Bill as drafted.6. The reasons why the Service Departments press for both pensions in full are as follows : -Full benefits under the Bill are provided for the civil insured population after payment of a certain number of contributions. As the sailor, soldier, etc., whether serving or discharged, will pay in exactly the same way and at the same rate, there is no justification for withholding; from the soldier&apos;s family part of the benefits for which he has paid.

W.-E.The Wae Office,6th July, 1925.1. Under the Bill, a sailor or soldier is entitled to his pension for service or disability from Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, or Ministry of Pensions, plus the Bill pension in full at 65. The widow of a sailor or soldier who dies a natural death while serving or after discharge is entitled to service pension plus widow&apos;s pension in full.

The widow&apos;s children are similarly dealt with.3. The three Service Departments object to this clause and consider that both pensions should be paid in full in the case of future widows and their children, whether war widows or post-war widows.4. A compromise has been proposed by Minister of Health which will give instead oi full Bill pension (10s. a week), a pension of 2s. 6d. a week for widows originating up-to 1932, 5s. a week for widows originating up to 1937, 7s. 6d. orginating up to 1942,. 10s. for those originating thereafter. Those drawing 2s. Qd. will not rise to 5s. in 1937,, and so on.The underlying principle of this scale is that the amount payable rises with the number of contributions paid by the husband before his death.Children are to get in effect either service or Bill pension, whichever is greater, but not both.This is in substitution for a previous proposed compromise of service pension plus half Bill pension for widows and children.5. The Service Departments do not accept this compromise and press for full pensions for future widows and children.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer wishes to adhere to &apos; the Bill as drafted.6. The reasons why the Service Departments press for both pensions in full are as follows : . &apos; \      &quot;Full benefits under the Bill are provided for the civil insured population after payment of a certain number of contributions. As the sailor, soldier, etc., whether serving or discharged, will pay in exactly the same way and&apos; at the same rate, there is no justification for withholding from the soldier&apos;s family part of the benefits for which he has paid.
The Service Departments have agreed that as the provision of the Bill pension for existing, widows is &quot; uncovenanted &quot; and has not been paid for by the husband, it is defensible, although not logical, that existing service widows should not receive the Bill pension in addition to Service pension, notwithstanding that ordinary civilian widows are to receive this &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit. .&apos;    &apos;       &apos; &apos;In giving an &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit it is defensible to withhold it from those who are already provided for by the State, seeing that the cost of giving it to existing service widows would be  4,000,000 to  5,000,000 a year.Benefits for future widows, however, are &quot;covenanted,&quot; i.e., the qualifying -contributions will have been made. The fact that the. provision of the full rate of pension under the Act would involve similar treatment for future widows under the Ministry of Pensions whose husbands have paid the due number of contributions under the Act, and that considerable expenditure will result, does not appear to the Service Departments to be a reason for adopting an illogical course which, in their opinion, it will be quite impossible to defend by any process of reasoning when the point is raised, as it certainly must be.7. While the Service Departments do not base their reasons for double pension entirely or mainly on the reference in the Bill to the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, it is relevant to refer to it (clause 25). Under the Bill, in the case of the widow of a civilian who is killed by a motor lorry in such circumstances as to render his widow eligible for compensation under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act, the Bill widow&apos;s pension is to be paid in full in addition to the compensation she gets under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.This fact re-mforces the argument of the Service Departments that both Bill and Service widow&apos;s pension should be paid in full. There is no reason whatever for differentiating between a civilian widow in a case of this kind and a Naval, Military, etc., widow whose husband is killed by an accident through service, e.g., run over by a field gun at manoeuvres, or dies as a result of service, e.g., malaria on the West Coast.The maximum amount payable for a widow under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act is  300, about equivalent to the Bill Pension of 10s. a week..The Bill provides that where compensation is payable under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act for the man&apos;s children, whether there is a widow in receipt of compensation or not, (the limit is  300 for child or children) Bill pension shall not be given. It may be argued from this that while the Bill pension should be given in full to the widow in addition to service pension, no Bill pension should be given for children. The Service Departments do not take this view but would be inclined to accept such a compromise.8. The Ministry of Health object on the ground of expense. The number of post-wa,r widows is not likely to be large, apart from a future war, which will have to be specially legislated for, but the Ministry of Pensions&apos; widows are the serious factor, particularly as the widow of any man now drawing pension from the Ministry of Pensions becomes entitled to widow&apos;s pension from the Ministry of Pensions if the man dies solely of the disability, subject to certain conditions.The Service Departments&apos; answer to the expense objection is given in paragraph 6.9. It has been suggested by the Ministry of Health that Naval, Military, etc., service involves greater risk of death resulting from employment than is the case in civil life and that therefore the contribution is not enough to give full civil benefits. The Service Departments do not agree. We are concerned with risks in peace only and the Ministry of Health do not seriously press the view that peace risks in the Navy, Army, and Royal Air Porce are greater than those in, e.g., the mining industry. The service man is a picked man, abnormally well fed, housed, and looked after, and it seems probable that the risks of death due to service are below rather than above the normal risk.10. The Service department-allotments do not consider that the Ministry of Health reasons for opposing both pensions in full for widows and children offer any satisfactory and logical answer to their arguments in favour of both pensions in full.
