THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROF5RTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT.CABIN S T. SECRET. &quot;T-*&quot;*                                           SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. CP. 378 (25),---PACKING AND CAPPING PAPER. Memorandum by the president  of the Board of TradefThe Board of Trade have been making careful enquiry Into^ an application for the imposition of a duty on packing and wrapping paper.   The number of workpeople Is substantial, and so far as information can be obtained, the home production appears to be less than before the war, while imports are higher than in 1913 and are Increasing. The competition comes mainly from Sweden, Norway and Germany, in which countries the rates of wages In the industry are seriously below those in this country,    I propose, therefore, to refer this application, to a Committee for further enquiry.I have also received applications in respect of metal fittings for coffins and amorphous carbon electrodes for use in the manufacture of special steels.     In neither of these cases is a prima facie case made out under the White Paper, aid I am accordingly rejecting the applications. I propose to see that the position of carbon electrodes is considered in connection ifith the inquiry into the key industry duties under Part 1 of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, which it will be necessary., ^o undertake in the Autumn.(Intld.)
