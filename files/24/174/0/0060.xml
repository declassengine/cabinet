CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,. 40 6THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,S E C RET.CAB I N E T.CP.561(25).HOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES (AMENDMENT) BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. This Bill corresponds, so far as regards Sections 1, 3 and 4, to the Measuring Instruments Bill which was introduced in the House of Commons in 1922, but, owing to pressure of Parliamentary business, did not proceed to second reading in that session.   A similar Bill was introduced in the House of Lords during last session and passed to the Commons on 29th July.   Owing to the dissolution, however, the Bill was only read a first time.   On both previous occasions there were no signs of opposition to it, and it may be hoped that on re^introduction the measure can be got through as a non-contentious measure.   A large number of Local Authorities, Associations, etc, have made representations to the Board of Trade in favour of the Bill, particularly in regard to petrol pumps.   A list of these is given in the Appendix.2.   The object of   Clauses 1, 3 and 4 of the Bill i3 to remedy a defect in the existing law, under which measuring instruments are free from any effective control.   Patterns of measuring instruments   can be submitted to the Board of Trade for approval, but are not required to be so submitted: nor are measuring instruments in actual use required to be periodically examined by Inspectors of Weights and Measures. This position which obviously gives scope for abuse, will be remedied if the Bill is passed, and it will then be possible to deal with several descriptions of measuring instruments which ought to be subject to control. Of these the most important atpresent are petrol-measuring pumps.-1-
3l   PBTROL PUMPS..   Petrol-measuring pumps of various types, which deliver petrol direct to the tanks of motor cars from underground reservoirs, have been growing steadily in numbers for some years, and the question of their legal status has been raised from time to time by Local Authorities in aLl parts of the country, who are very dissatisfied with the present position. Complaints of short measure have also been made by private individuals, and in the technical press: and in America, where the pumps are much more oommon than they are here, a considerable amount of trouble has also been experienced. On the other hand, the petrol-pump, with it3 underground storage chamber, is much to be preferred, from the point of view of public safety, to the two gallon can, and is more convenient in every way,  so that there is no doubt that it will come much more extensively into use in the future. It is, therefore, desirable that the types in use should be brought under regulation at the earliest possible moment, before a large number of possibly unsatisfactory pumps are actually instal led.4.    The principal makers of all types of these pumps desire them to be brought under inspection, and have, in fact, submitted patterns for approval under Section 6 of the Weights and Measures Act, 1904, in readiness for any regulations which may be imposed: and as already indicated Local Authorities, Inspectors and users of petrol may be expected to welcome the proposals in the Bill,6t    GENERAL.    The Leather Measurement Act, 1919, is repealed (except as regards Ireland, to which the Bill does not apply), as all the powers it conferred will be exerciseable under the Bill.
ft U;-p6* It would be neither desirable nor practicable to bring all measuring instruments directly under the full provisions of the Weights and Measures Acts.    Hence the procedure under the Bill is by way of issuing Regulations specifying the description of measuring instrument . to be brought under control, and the provisions of the Weights and Measures Acts to be applied.    It is intended to deal immediately with the particular case mentioned in paragraphs 5 and 4 of this memorandum., and the Bill gives the Board of Trade power to make regulations about other kinds of instruments without further legislation.    Such power is likely to be needed having regard to the trend of modern development.Any regulations made under the Bill will, under the Weights and Measures Act., 1904, require to be laid bofore Parliament, as soon as may be after thoy are made.New Provision as to ,Fee.s. The 3oard of Trade are already required by the Weights and Measures Aots to examine patterns of Measuring Instruments submitted to them for that purpose., and have power to charge fees for this work, and to prescribe the fees to bo taken by Inspectors of Weights and Measures for examining instruments of approved types.    The fees so prescribed are designed to covor the cost of the Local Authority of carrying out the work.8. Section 2 of the present Bill is new, and is required to regularise a practice in regard to charging fees for testing weights and measures and. standards therefor, which the Law Officers have recently advised goes beyond the strict wording of the Law.Section 13 of tho Weights and Measures Act, 1889, and Section 9 of the Weights and Measures Act, 1904, authorise Inspectors of Weights and Measures appointed by Local Authorities to charge fees for the verification and stamping of traders&apos; weights and measures, etc., and empower the fixing of such foos by Order in Council.
Section 8(1) of the Aot of 1889,---extended by Section 6 of the Pees (Increase) Act, 1923. authorises the Board of Trade to take fees for the comparison and verification of other weights and measures and standards therefor.In the opinion of the Board of Trade and of, at any rate, a large majority of Local Authorities, the proper basis upon which the fees should be assessed is that of the work done in testing whether or not the appliances are found correct.    Until recently fees were not charged upon rejected appliances, but in 1923 on reconsideration of che position, it was considered that under the provisions of the Acts they could be so charged.    Since that date,  therefore,  fees have been charged on rejected appliances in the case of tests made by the Board of Trade and steps were in contemplation to adopt the same course in the case of tests made by Inspectors working under Local Authorities.    The point was taken, however, by the National Federation of Scalemakers that fees could not be charged by Inspectors on rejected weights and measures, and on reference being made to the law Officers they have advised that neither the Board nor the Inspectors have, under the wording of the existing Acts, the power to charge foes unless the appliance tested is found correct.    The object of Section 2 of the present Bill is to regularise the charging of fees on rejects by the Board of Trade during tho past two years and to enable the Board and Inspectors&quot;to charge such foes in the future*(Intld.)
