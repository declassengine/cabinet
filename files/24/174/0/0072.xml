Circulated to the Cabinet by  dirfo-ion of / nThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.       - -[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]CONFIDENTIAL.[W 6867/9/98]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to M. Briand.Dear M. Briand, Foreign Office, July 24, 1925.MANY thanks for your letter of the 13th July, in which you give me your first impressions on the questions raised in rny letter of the 2nd July regarding the agenda of the forthcoming Assembly of the League of Nations.1 agree with you that it may well be impossible to avoid some discussion on the Protocol, and perhaps some restatement of our respective points of view, since as you say the Council has referred to the Assembly the statements made by all of us at the Council meeting in March. This was what I had in mind when 1 wrote in my letter of the 2nd July, and I had no idea of suggesting any curtailment of the liberty of the Assembly, whether in regard to discussions on the Protocol or on disarmament; but, as I added, this is quite a different thing from our two Governments taking the initiative in proposing to amend or rewrite the Covenant at the present time or even encouraging others to do so.Nor is there, as I think, any difference of purpose between us on the question of disarmament. France desires the reduction of armaments&apos; as we desire it. We recognise, as France recognises, that the obstacle to disarmament is the sense of insecurity which prevails in Europe, and that the road to disarmament lies through security. This is the basis of the policy of the Mutual Pact which we are pursuing together at this moment. The objections which I feel to a detailed discussion of the Protocol still more to any attempt to draw up a new protocol at this Assembly apply, as you say, in large measure to any attempt to formulate a scheme of disarma-ment in the same Assembly. The time to consider further action on these subjects will come when the Pact negotiations have been completed and the Pact itself has come into force.What, therefore, I desired to propose was that if we are obliged, as we may not improbably be, to take part in discussions on these subjects in September, our two delegations should content themselves with restating the well-known positions taken up by their respective Governments, that neither collectively nor individually should we take the initiative in making new proposals on these matters to the Assembly at the present time, and that if such proposals are made by others, we should together deprecate their discussion until the result of the communications now passing in regard to the Mutual Pact and its accompanying instruments are concluded.You will, I know, share my wish that in this matter, as in all others relating to the Pact, we should act in full agreement with Belgium. I will, therefore, take the first opportunity of explaining my views to Baron Moncheur.Yours very sincerely,AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.2982a [13402]
