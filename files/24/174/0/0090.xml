an ....*,*.391 (25)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF EIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.C    A   B    IN    E    T.PAY    OF    OFFICERS. MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY.I have considered &quot;the Report of the Second Committee on Rates of Pay for New Entrants in the Fighting Services, dealing with the pay of Officers,  (CP.370(25)  ), and I am prepared on behalf of the Admiralty to accept the new rates of Naval pay set forth on page 6,  subject to the approval of the Committee&apos;s recommendation that these now rates are only to apply to new entrants into the Navy and not to any Officers now serving.     The Admiralty also accept the proviso that the Naval Cadets who are still under training atDartmouth and have not commenced- their sea service at theare apolieddate when the new scales/are to bo regarded as new entrants.I desire, however, to call attention to the followingpoints(1) It must be understood that there are many subsidiaryquestions, eeg. pay of future Warrant Offleers,future Medical Officers, Chaplains, etc.,which have still to be considered in the light of these new rates, and which it may not be possible to settle before the 1st October.(2) The question of Marriage Allowance for new entrantsstill remains to be settled, although the Cabinet have come to a decision against granting such an Allowance to existing Naval Officers.   The Cabinet Committee, In their Report on the subject, expressed themselves as in favour of a differentiation in emoluments between single and married Officers if
(Initd),   W.C.B. 6.8. 25 aan opportunity arose for introducing it in connection with some general revision of Service pay.    In regard to new entrants it.appears that this opportunity now arises, as we are making a fresh start with new scales of pay.     I propose, therefore, that in publishing the scales for now entrants, tho Admiralty should make a provisional deduction in all rates for Lieutenant Commanders, Commanders and Captains, and should announce that In addition to these rates a Marriage Allowance of an amount to be hereafter settled will be payable to married Officers over 30 (new entrants only),With regard to the Committee1s second recommendation which concerns Messing expenses, the conclusion that has been drawn on the strength, as I am informed, of a reply to a single question, respecting Sub^Liaunetants&apos; Messing Subscription, is quite erroneous.     I attach a note which states the facts, and should welcome an exhaustive enquiry into the subject.     I suggest that this could bast be done by the Committee that is to bo set up to suggest economies in the Fighting Services.
APFKIIDIX TO C-P, 591(25)MESSING EXPENSES IN THE ROYAL WAVY.With reference to Paragraphs 7 and 11 (2) of CP. 570(25), the Committee has drawn from a perfectly correct reply &quot;by the Admiralty witness an altogether unjustifiable Inference as to the cost of messing in the Navy.The facts as to cost of messing are as follows:-As In the Army, so in the Navy, the cost ofOfficers1 messing falls partly on the State, partly on theOfficer.The State pays, in respect of each Officer in the Mess, a Victualling Allowance based on the cost of the Ration Issued to the men, which Allowance therefore arises and falls with the cost of the principal articles of food (bread, Meat etc.) .   The amount of this Allowance Is at present l/5-id. a day.    (When the cost of living was at Its &quot;peak&quot;, the allowance was l/lld).The cost of Messing over and above this Allowance falls upon the Officer, but a maximum is placed by the Kings&apos; Regulations on the amount of the Mess subscription, so as to check any tendency to extravagance.In the Ward Room, the oompulsory Subscription for Messing must not exceed 2/- a day, (excluding Wine).In the Gun Room, the Subscription must not exceed l/3d a day. In addition, the following (all maxima) are authorised for Gun Room Officers(a) Por renewals of Mess Gear . .&apos;.......5/- a month.(b) Por &quot;Extras&quot; at the option ofthe Individual :-Sub-Lieuts *.................. 20/- a month.Acting Sub-Lieuts.)
