THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Tha following Memorandum deals in detail with the proposal contained in my Memorandum (CP. 366) for the necessary assistance to maintain the British Industries Fair.    This Fair was initiated in 1915, and ten   Fairs have been organised by the Department of Overseas Trade in London from 1915 to 1924.      In 1925 the London Fair had to be abandoned in view of the re-opening of the British Empire Exhibition, Birmingham after the war also started a British Industries Fair, which has been organised separately by the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, but under the auspices and with the support of the Department.2. Up to 1923 the London Fair had been self-supporting, but the 1924 Fair showed a loss of about  10,000 due mainly to the competition of Wembley.3, The question now is whether the London Fair is to be revived in 1926.     Enquiries of potential exhibitors have been somewhat discouraging, but it is always a difficult matter to get   definite undertakings from manufacturers in regard to an event&apos;which is not due to take place for several months.     On the other hand the committee of the exhibitors, which advises the Department of Overseas Trade, has evinced a very strong desire that the Fair should be carried on. At the same time they urge that special measures must be taken to assist the Fair through the difficult period broughtSECRET.CP. 386  (25)CABINET,Future of the British Industries Fair.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.
about by the continuance of the depression in trade.     They point out - and the statement is borne out by information in the possession of the Department of Overseas Trade - that all the Continental Pairs receive substantial subsidies from the Governments or Municipalities concerned.     They ask, therefore, that the Government should provide  ,100,000 to be spread over four years, the proportion to be spent each year to be higher, if this can be arranged, in the earlier part of the period, and they suggest that the money should be spent mainly upon a wide-spread scheme of publicity.     World-wide publicity is of the essence of a successful Fair, and I cannot but feel that sufficient money has never hitherto been spent in advertising the British Industries Fair abroad, certainly it has never been advertised overseas to the extent to which foreign Fairs are advertised in this country.4. I am convinced that, unless financial assistance is given...the^air will have to be abandoned, and I submit that this would be a very unfortunate thing at the moment when we are encouraging the launching of a propaganda campaign for the purchase of British goods.     The Fair, as my colleagues.^doubtless know, exists solely for the sale of British goods, and only British manufacturers are allowed to participate.   T/e should therefore be placing ourselves in an almost indefensible position, if we refuse to sustain, as part of our British goods campaign, the one constructive effort that has been made for a combined advertisement of British Manufactures.5. I would urge, therefore, that we give the support which is asked.     As the money is to be spent on publicity, it would benefit the Birmingham Fair as well as the London Fair, since publicity for the two Fairs has always been conducted jointly, and since it will cost no more to include Birmingham in any advertisement effort overseas.      I think it Is important that a grant should be made not for one year only, but, as
suggested, for a period&apos; of four years in order to give the pair a fair chance of &quot;becoming securely established.     If exhibitors know the pair is going to go on for a certain number of years, they are able to make arrangements which reduce the cost of their stands, etc.     I would suggest that--we agree to a grant of  100,000 to be spent over four years.-(Intd.)
