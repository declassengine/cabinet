CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY- -(&quot;This Document is the Property&quot; ol His Britannic MaiesWs Governrna?iJ. 1 Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1925.SECRET.CP. 306 (25).CABINET.KUO MIN TANG.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE Kuo Min Tang was founded in 1910 by Sun Yat-Sen as a Chinese Nationalist League. For its history and activities, see note annexed. The society has of late come increasingly under Bolshevik influence, and its extremist section, acting in close touch with and subsidised from Moscow, has become so powerful that the activities of the society constitute a serious menace to peace and good order in Malaya, where the most important branches of the society outside China are to be found.2. The Governor of the Straits Settlements has reported that the present position is highly unsatisfactory. At present the society, while not recognised by law in the Straits Settlements, is so recognised in the Malay States a state of affairs which causes considerable embarrassment to the Malayan Governments, and which, in the Governors opinion, cannot continue. The Governor strongly recommends that, in view of the increasingly dangerous character of the society&apos;s activities, which, with the extremist element in power, are now definitely aimed at the destruction of British authority in the East, steps should be taken forthwith to suppress the Malayan branches of the society.3. The Governor and his advisers are confident that the suppression of these branches can be carried out without local disturbance. The possible effects elsewhere of any action in Malaya have been discussed at an Inter-Departmental Conference, of which the minutes are annexed. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has also discussed the question with His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking, from the point of view of the political situation in China, and he desires to raise no objection to the action proposed by the Governor.4. Since the Governor made his recommendations the news of Sun Yat-Sen&apos;s death has been received.    His death seems to afford a particularly favourable opportunity for -taking action in Malaya, and it would appear very desirable that the Governor of the Straits Settlements should be authorised to take the necessary -steps for the suppression of the Malayan branches of the society.A. C. L. S. A.Downing Street, June 1925.Kuo Min Tang.Suggested Suppression of Malayan Branches.1. History.The Kuo Min Tang was founded by Dr. Sun Yat-Sen in Tokyo in 1910 as a Chinese Nationalist League with the particular aim of the suppression of the Manchu dynasty.   The revolution in China in 1911 achieved this aim, but the Kuo Min Tang&quot;[13239] . b
was retained in being, in Sun Yat-Sen&apos;s own words: &quot;To free China from all foreign domination, first of Japan and then of all other Powers.&quot; In 1913 President Yuan Shih Kai, by decree, dissolved the society&apos;s head lodge at Peking, whereupon the headquarters of the Kuo Min Tang were moved to Shanghai. Since the beginning of 1922 the central organisation of the society has been located at Canton.2. Activities.The Kuo Min Tang has long possessed a world-wide organisation having branches and affiliated societies distributed throughout the globe. The most important of these are to be found in Southern China and in Malaya. Powerful branches also exist in the United States of America, though these are known only as branches of the Chinese Seamen&apos;s Union. There appears to be no doubt that the general aims and organisation of the society approximate very closely to those of the tamous Irish Republican Brotherhood.The platform of the society has always been extremely democratic, and in its manifestos the society has declared itself in favour of Socialism. Sun Yat-Sen&apos;s avowed policy was to use the society to govern not only Canton but the whole Chinese Empire. In pursuance of this object he coquetted at various times with every shade of revolutionary sentiment, with the result that an extreme revolutionary section rapidly sprang up in the ranks of the Kuo Min Tang, and has now attained such numbers and influence that it has virtually captured the control of the party machine. The society is in close touch with the Communist party in the Dutch East Indies and with Indian revolutionaries, with the result that it has to some extent assumed the aspect of a pan-Asiatic movement with the primary object of the destruction of Britain as the great despotic Power tryannising over Asia and therefore the chief obstacle in the way of world democracy. The danger of these activities has been aggravated by the close liaison which has been established during the last few years between the society and the Soviet. The Kuo Min Tang receives large contributions from Moscow, and the extreme section is infected with Bolshevik ideas and sentiment. Inflammatory propaganda advocating measures of sabotage and terrorism is freely disseminated by the Bolsheviks, and the records of the last six months show clearly the dangerous character which these activities have assumed.3. Position in Malaya.In the Straits Settlements the branches of the society are refused registration by the Government. In other words, a ban is placed on the society, which is forced in consequence to conduct its activities, by means of secret organisations. It is known that such secret societies exist in Singapore. There are also certain registered societies which are affiliated or connected with the Kuo Min Tang.In the Federated Malay States, on the other hand, recognition is accorded to the Kuo Min Tang and its branches are allowed to be registered. The society is therefore able to conduct its operations in the open and to bring pressure to bear on any Chinese who, from motives of loyalty, scruple or interest, are disinclined to associate themselves with so revolutionary an organisation.Sun Yat-Sen&apos;s object was to secure control of all Chinese in Malaya for political and economic purposes, while retaining them as far as possible as Chinese subjects. This object he virtually achieved by the federation of the labour guilds in Canton, these being the parent guilds of those in Malaya. The result is that an organisation exists which, if brought into operation, might at any time hold up the economic life of the Malay Peninsula.A-. Previous Proposals for Su^ypression of Malayan Branches.In 1922 the Governor of the Straits Settlements proposed the suppression of the Kuo Min Tang Lodges in the Federated Malay States on the ground that the object of the society was a concentrated attack on the British position in Asia in concert with the Bolsheviks. He had no doubt as to the need for suppression from the point of view of Malaya, but the international effects of such action had to be taken into consideration. &quot;The views of the Home Departments interested and of the Hong Kong Government were sought, and the proposal was generally viewed with disfavour in view of the then political situation in China and of the possibility of a reaction in Hong Kong and on British trade in South China generally. The Secretary of State felt unable in these circumstances to approve the Governor^ proposal, but invited him to report again later should the question become acute.
5. Present Proposals.In November last a despatch arrived from the Governor renewing his recommendation for the suppression of the Malayan branches of the society. He urged three reasons in support of his proposals ; (1.) The society had of late been flooded with recruits Avith Bolshevik leanings; it was common property that Sun Yat-Sen had been converted to Bolshevism and the Communist section of the society had increased in numbers and influence.(2.) The operations of the society had therefore become more dangerous than ever, and it was no longer possible to separate the purely political part of its propaganda from the anti-British and seditious side.(3.) These developments were by no means approved by all members of the society. There was, in fact, a split among members, and this would render it an easy matter to suppress the branches of the society without disturbance.(Secret.)Minutes of a Meeting held in the Conference Room at the Colonial Office at 3 p.m., on February 26, 1925, to discuss the Question of the Suppression of the Malayan Branches of the Kuo Min Tang.Present : Sir G. Grindle (in the Chair).Mr. W. T. Chapman ...Mr. D. BeattyMr. Waterlow Mr. Moss   ... Commander C. J. Crocker Major C. D. Rawson ... Major D. M. King    ... A representative of the S.I.S. Mr. Clauson Mr. ClutterbuckSecretary for Chinese Affairs, federated malay States. Secretary for Chinese Affairs, straits settlements.Foreign Office. Admiralty. War Office.Colonial Office.In his opening statement, Sir G. Grindle said that the question which the conference had been called to discuss was not by any means a new one. The High Commissioner for the Malay States had. in 1922 advocated the suppression of the Malayan branches of the K.M.T., on the ground that its activities by interfering with the liberties of Chinese subjects in Malaya constituted a serious menace to the Government. The policy of suppression had not, for various reasons, found favour with the Home Departments concerned, or with the Government of Hong Kong, which was afraid of a reaction in South China. The proposal was not, therefore, approved, but the High Commissioner was informed that he could raise the question again if and when he felt apprehensive that disorders might result from the activities of the society, and he was requested to report from time to time on the local situation. He had recently written a despatch, copies of which had been circulated to depart-ments interested, drawing attention to the fact that the society had lately become much more communistic in outlook, and that its extreme section had increased in numbers and in influence. The operations of the society had, therefore, become still more dangerous, and it was no longer possible to separate the political part of its propaganda from the anti-British and seditious side. Be added that these developments were by no means approved by all the members of the society, and thai there was in fact a split among members which would make it very easy to suppress the society without any risk of internal disturbance. He had recommended, therefore, that action should now be taken in this direction.- Mr. Chapman was then invited to explain the position in the Federated Malay States. He said that while in the Straits Settlements the Government refused to register the society, in the Federated Malay States the society was recognised and[13239] b 2
registered. There were two branches of the society in Malaya, one the old Pekinese K.M.T., and the other the modern branch of the K.M.T.., which owed allegiance to Sun Yat-Sen. The difficulty was that as the Society was registered, its members could virtually insist on the Chinese born in Malaya contributing to its funds. These Chinese were most loyal to the British rule, and were worthy of protection. Like all Chinese they had not much backbone, and while the society was definitely recognised by the Government they could hardly resist the pressure brought to bear on them by the extreme members to contribute. There was no doubt of the dangerous character of the society&apos;s activities, and he had received protests from more than one well-known Chinese who felt that while the society was registered they were in a hopeless position to resist it. The K.M.T. was aiming at absorbing, after the Canton precedent, all the Chinese trade unions in Malaya; this might lead to a very dangerous position, since all the best labour in Malaya, including that at the docks, was Chinese.In reply to a question, Mr. Beatty explained that while the society was not recognised or registered in the Straits Settlements, its organisation existed below the surface. The Government knew of three secret lodges at least, but felt that they were hardly in a position to take as strong measures against the society as they would have liked when it was allowed to exist openly in the Federated Malay States.Mr. Chapman, when asked what measures would be taken if the suppression of the organisation in Malaya was approved, said that the first step was to suppress the society as a registered society, i.e., to cross its name off the register; after that the society would be discredited in Chinese eyes, and its membership would dwindle rapidly. He did not think that there would be any difficulty or disturbance, and he instanced a society which had formerly existed in Malaya and which at one time was nearly as powerful as the K.M.T. Measures had been taken against this society, and the result had been that no respectable Chinese continued to belong to it, and it became a negligible quantity. One result of crossing the society off the register would be the suppression of its literature and propaganda. It would also be possible to prevent the leaders from communicating with the rank and file, and this would probably prevent any trouble in the future with regard to Chinese labour. It would, of course, be possible to deport any extremists who stirred up mischief. When asked what were the worst measures of retaliation which the members of the society might undertake, Mr. Chapman said that they might attempt a boycott or strike, but, apart from isolated action against the personnel of the Chinese Protectorate, no serious difficulty need be anticipated, since it was quite clear that the members Avere not solidly together. In such an event, there would doubtless be a split, corresponding roughly to the distinction between the mechanic and trade class on the one hand and the unskilled and more respectable classes on the other.Mr. Beatty was then asked for his observations, and explained, in reply to Mr. Water!ow, that the situation was that in the Straits Settlements the society was refused registration and was forced to conduct its activities secretly, but in Hong Kong and in the Federated Malay States the society was a recognised society and was able to function in the open. The points which he wished to impress upon the committee were these : &apos;1. The K.M.T. was a political party. It followed that if one party was recognised and registered, registration could not logically be refused to other political parties. The present position was therefore difficult to defend. On the other hand, if other political parties were recognised, there was no doubt that serious fighting would result, and he instanced the political riots which took place in Malaya in 1911 and 1912. In elaboration of this point, Mr. Chapman explained that he had received applications for registration from a society which was opposed to the K.M.T. He had hitherto managed to find excuses for postponing registration, but the position was really very difficult, and he felt that the present policy could not be continued much longer; either all political parties must be suppressed or else they must all be recognised; and, in view of the serious disturbances which would certainly take place if all parties were recognised, the only safe course to take was the suppression of all political parties. In Malaya the K.M.T. was also an organisation the members of which were bound by oath to obey orders from Canton; such orders might direct the members to strike or start a boycott.2. Continuing, Mr. Beatty said that he had, during his service in Malaya, obtained  considerable experience of  the methods of  Sun Yat-Sen&apos;s
3 n)supporters. In 1911 and 1912 there had been an outbreak of gang robberies in Malacca and in the neighbouring Unfederated Malay State of Johore. These robberies were conducted by a Triad Society, and on the average numbered one a week. He had himself proceeded to&quot;Malacca, where many of the robberies were taking place, and made investigations, with the result that he had been able to^trace that the proceeds had been-regularly despatched to Sun Yat-Sen and his party via Kuala Lumpur. It was very significant that during the last two years Sun Yat-Sen had, in his public speeches, made eulogistic references to the Triad Societies; also that during the Avar branches of this society had ceased to exist to a great extent, but that since 1921, i.e., after Sun&apos;s return to power in Canton, they had come into existence again in Singapore and had grown to such an extent that they now embraced large numbers of the unskilled classes of labour, such as iightermen, loading coolies, &quot;&amp;c.3. By federating all the labour guilds in Canton,&apos; Sun Yat-Sen had virtually obtained control of all the guilds in Malaya, since the former were the parent guilds of the latter. The result was that an organisation existed which, if brought into operation, might at any time hold up the whole life of Singapore, and what he might call the general economic life of Malaya.4. Sun&apos;s prestige in Malaya stood very high. He had had great difficulties to overcome, but he had successfully disposed of them. He instanced the case of the Hylam Chinese, who were nearly all domestic servants to Europeans. These Chinese had always been vigorously anti-Sun, and yet now they were to be numbered among Sun&apos;s most ardent supporters, and would obey his orders or those of the K.M.T.5. Sun and his supporters, the K.MLT. leaders, were quite unscrupulous; Mr. Beatty gave instances of the way in which money was extorted by terrorism from non-members of the K.M.T., by holding to ransom in China relatives of well-to-do Chinese residents in Malaya during the War.Mr. Chapman added that the key to the position was to deny registration to all political parties; once this step was taken, respectable Chinese, who had all the money; would melt away; funds would dwindle; and without funds the activities of the society would become negligible.Sir G. Grindle then read a telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong, whose view was that extremist elements elsewhere would probably be strengthened by the suppression of the Malayan branches of the K.M.T. Some labour trouble was to be expected in Hong Kong,and the possibility of a boycott in Canton could not be disregarded. In short, the consequences might be very serious to Hong Kong trade and British trade in South China generally.Mr. Waterlow was then asked for the Foreign Office view, and said that one of the principal difficulties appeared to be that the society was such a composite one since it comprised a section which was highly respectable and one which was highly disreputable. He was inclined to share the view of the Governor of Hong Kong that repressive measures might drive the respectable members of the society into the arms of the extremists. Moreover, it had to be remembered that the K.M.T. had now virtually become part of the Government of China. What he asked himself was whether it would not be best to leave the first move to them, and only to squash them if they gave trouble. Every blow on&quot; our side would give fuel to anti-British propaganda, and action such as that suggested might be used to work up an awkward situation. He took the opportunity of reading to the conference a telegram which had just been received from Peking, in which the view was expressed that it would be preferable for action to be postponed until the situation in China became clearer. The point was made that the K.M.T. could no longer be regarded as a disaffected revolutionary faction in the South, but now constituted one of the leading political parties in China, which might be called on to form a Government at any moment. If, however, action in Malaya could not be postponed, the suggestion was made that it might be taken against the Communist section of the party alone.Neither Mr. Chapman nor Mir. Beatty thought that it would be possible, in taking measures for suppression, to discriminate between the Communist section of the society and the more respectable members. The line that they felt strongly should be taken was in the direction of suppressing all political parties in Malaya, and not merely a section of one party.Mr. Waterlow said that a telegram had been received from the Consul-General
at Canton, in which he had come down on the side of suppression, on the ground that the anti-Brith-h feeling in Canton was such that it could not be made worse by any measures which might be undertaken in Malaya. The Consul-General at Canton was, however, only able to take a local view, and could not be expected to possess the broader outlook of the Legation. When asked for information as to how the death of Sun Yat-Sen might affect the position, Mr. Waterlow said that all Chinese affairs were so very obscure that it was impossible to prophesy. It appeared, however, that the extremist elements would, in any event, remain in control of the K.M.T.The representative of the S.I.S. then observed that the tone of the manifestos sent from Moscow to China had changed of late; whereas before comparatively moderate measures, such as strikes and boycotts, had been suggested, the documents now advocated measures of violence and exhorted the Chinese to sabotage and terrorism. Soviet propaganda had lately taken this tone all over the world. There was no doubt, therefore, from this point of view, that the society was becoming more and more dangergus. He instanced the cases of European countries who had taken measures to suppress propaganda and movements of this character; in every case suppression had been easily accomplished without disturbance, and the parties concerned had taken it lying down. In view of these precedents, he doubted whether if stern measures were taken against the K.M.T. any serious reaction was to be anticipated.Mr. Moss, who had recently returned from Shanghai, then gave his own personal view. In his opinion, there was no doubt that a series of strikes and anti-foreign demonstrations of a serious character would shortly eventuate in South China. Any one of these would be capable of being converted, as political expediency required, into a national issue. If this was the case, and he felt strongly that it was the case, would it not be better for the issue to be joined on a question of principle on which His Majesty&apos;s Government had strong views than on a question which the local agitators could choose for themselves, and on which, if they were clever in their choice, the British Government might have the worst of the argument ? Personally, therefore, he w^as in favour of measures of suppression being taken in Malaya, irrespective of the position in South China, but he considered that it would be wiser to wait until there was some overtly hostile act, as it would be necessary to have a peg on which to hang the new proposals. He felt bound, however, to point out that, if the suppression of the Malayan branches of the society was widely advertised in China, serious reaction might be expected with damaging results to British trade.After further discussion, the arguments for and against the suppression of the Malayan branches of the society appeared to be briefly as follows : For 1. There was definite evidence that the extremist elements of the society were increasing in strength and influence. The activities of the society were undoubtedly highly dangerous, and a situation might arise in which the life of Malaya might be paralysed.2. It would be, in the opinion of the experts, necessary to suppress the society sooner or later, and it would be better to take action now than later on, when the society might be still more powerful, and their organisation more highly perfected.3. From the point of view of the Admiralty suppression would be preferable now than later on, since if there was any trouble, the Admiralty would prefer to see it over before they were deeply committed in naval develop-ments at Singapore.4. Suppression when the society became more powerful might necessitate the despatch of troops to both Malaya and Hong Kong (see below).Against .1. The K.M.T. was now one of the leading political parties in China, and might at any time be called upon to form a Government. Suppression of its branches in Malaya might do harm by furnishing our enemies in China with a pretext for further anti-British propaganda, and with a useful cry for stirring up the Chinese to anti-foreign and revolutionary action.2. Any reaction in China would have serious and immediate repercussions in Hong Kong, and British and Hong Kong trade might be seriously affected.
3. The War Office would deprecate any action which might cause trouble in China. * Our garrisons in the Far East were very weak, and in the event of trouble the nearest source of reinforcement would be India. Conditions in India might not allow of troops being sent, and in that case troops would have to be sent from home. It would take at least two months before any troops from home could arrive at Hong Kong, so that ample warning of any likely trouble was most desirable.No definite conclusion was reached by the conference, and it was felt that the question was one for decision by higher authority. It was clear that the consent of the Cabinet would have to be obtained before any action could be taken.(083/5417 (M.O.1).)(Secret.) War Office, London, S.W.I.Sir, &quot; April 28, 1925.I AM commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge receipt of Colonial Office letter No. 11790/1925, dated the 6th April, 1925, forwarding a copy of the minutes of a meeting held at the Colonial Office on the 26th February to discuss the question of the suppression of the Malayan branches of the Kuo Min Tang.I am to say that, in the opinion of the Army Council a somewhat false impression as to their attitude is conveyed in the summary on the last page of these minutes, which shows the War Office as apparently definitely against the suppression of the society. I am to point out that this is not, and never has been, the attitude of the Council. As pointed out in their previous letters. Nos. 0S3/5417 (M.I.2), dated the 8th^February, 1923, and 083/5417 (M.O.1), dated&apos;the 3rd November, 1924, and as explained by their representatives at the meeting in question, the Army Council feel that the question is so largely political in nature that they do not consider themselves justified in giving an opinion either for or against the suppression of the lvuo Min Tang.The Council merely desire to emphasise that, before the decision to suppress the society is made, the probable consequences should be fully weighed in view of our military weakness in the Far East, and due warning given them so that the necessary precautions to meet these consequences may be taken.I am, &amp;c.B. B. CUBITT.The Under-secretary of State, Colonial Office, S.W. 1.o* Bat see War Office letter of the 28th April, printed below.
