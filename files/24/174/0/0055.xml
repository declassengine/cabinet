. . 377document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)CABINET.   .t) 5.- SUPPLY AND TRAN SPORT COMMITTEE.REPORT.The Supply and Transport Organisation, which former Governments have relied on in times of industrial crisis for the maintenance of supplies essential to the life of the civil community, was continued in being by the decision of the Cabinet in November 192* (Cabinet 64(24) Conclusion 5).A general survey of this organisation and its functions is contained in the Anderson Report  (CP. 314(23)).The Supply and Transport Committee,  since it was set up by the present Government, has from time to time reviewed the various emergency arrangements and has overhauled and elaborated the machinery in certain respects.    At the outset however it should be stated that,  owing to changed conditions and the disappearance of all the special war-time organisation material and personnel,  it is no longer possible to make detailed arrangements and to maintain a complete and elaborate organisation which would be ready to function immediately an emergency arises. If and when such an emergency arises,  it is inevitable that there should be considerable dislocation of public services.    What the Committee have aimed at, following the principles laid down by their predecessors,  is to provide a nucleus organisation which can be expanded to meet the needs of the situation.The position with regard to the main emergency arrangements is as foliows:-(1) Emergency Regulations.1A draft code of Regulations under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, which was drawn up in consultation between all the Departments concerned, has recently been reviewed and amended in certain respects.    The code is intended not necessarily for use as it stands but rather as a collection of Regulations from which
-2-a selection may be made to suit the circumstances of any emergency that may arise.A selection from these Regulations has been made to meet the case of the country being faced with an emergency limited to the mining industry.    A copy of the Regulations is attached..  -The Mines Department consider that this selected code contains all the powers whioh they would require at the outset of the emergency. (2) Food.The Board of Trade have prepared a panel of representatives of the principal food trades to keep the Board in. touch with the food position and to be available for consultation in an emergency.    These experts will be available for consultation in regard to their particular food trades.The list of persons selected to act as divisional food officers and food advisers to the  Civil Commissioners in the eleven divisions,  into which the  country is divided for emergency purposes., has been revised and vacancies in that list have been filled.    All the divisional officers have been visited or personally communicated with during the last six weeks. (3) Transport *The responsibility for road transport arrangements in times of emergency rests with the Ministry of Transport.    In pursuance of the decision of the Supply and Transport Committee,  the Ministry of Transport has arranged for the establishment of committees of haulage contractors at the headquarters of the eleven divisional areas upon the occurrence of any emergency. Suitable persons have been selected to act at each divisional headquarters as Chairmen and conveners of local haulage committees which will be charged with the duty of pooling the resoxirces of the owners of transport vehicles in times of emergency.    Arrangements are being made for the appointment of Chairmen of Haulage Committees at a number of centres in addition to the divisional headquarters,  the new centres to be selected by the Minister of Transport,-    The Minister is getting into touchA
&apos;    &apos; .   .       &quot;3-through his officers with suitable persons at the selected centres and every endeavour is being made to complete the  arrangements before the end of July. (4) Coal.The emergency scheme of the Mines Department is practically complete.    If the necessity arose, directions would be issued under the Emergency Regulations for regulating the supply and distribution of fuel for domestic and. industrial purposes and for controlling export arid, bunker coal.The personnel of the Emergency Organisation is drawn from the various sections of the Coal Trade,  the Local Authorities being responsible for the conservation and distribution of supplies within their own districts. (5) Electric Power.A scheme exists for  the maintenance by naval ratings of the principal power stations in London. (6) Oommunicatjons.The General Post Office have prepared plans for maintaining postal telegraphic and telephonic communication.    A detailed Air Mail scheme has been prepared by the Air Ministry and the Home Office for the  conveyance of mails by air to certain centres from which further distribution would be carried out by road.    In the event of bad weather rendering flying impossible from London,  the mails would be carried by road instead of by aeroplane.    A Wireless Scheme has also been drawn up with the object of providing against an interruption of other means of communication. (7) Intelligence and Publicity.Plans have been made for the issue during an. emergency of daily bulletins from the Board, of Trade and for the organisation of publicity arrangements under the general supervision of the Deputy. Chief Civil Commissioner.(8) Personnel of Headquarters Nucleus Staff.The Committee have come  to the conclusion that there should be established at Headquarters a permanent nucleus staff charged with the duty Qf maintaining and supervising the emergency food and
-4- .3 6Uroad transport organisation.    It is proposed as regards food to attach this nucleus staff to the staff of the Food Council and to spread both the current Food Council work and the Emergency work over tlie combined staffse    In times of emergency this staff would be increased by borrowing the services from other Departments of civil servants who have had previous experience of Food Emergency work.The Home Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade have been in communication with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on these proposals and a detailed scheme is now being worked out between the Departments. (9) Arrangements in Scotland.If an emergency occurs the Scottish Office will set up Headquarters in Edinburgh under the charge of a Minister (probably the Lord Advocate or the Solicitor-General for Scotland) acting on behalf of the Secretary for Scotland and of other Departments as may be arranged.    It will work in close co-operation with the Authorities of the Naval, Military and Air Forces and with the G.P.O. and other Departments whose functions extend to Great BritainDistrict Commissioners responsible to the Headquarters in Edinburgh have been appointed to act at Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and Inverness with charge of the corresponding Divisions of the country.    Special arrangements have been made for Glasgow as the centre of the very important Western Division.    Instructions have been issued to District Commissioners on numerous subjects, e.g.,  areas ana. personnel,  statutory powers, food supplies, milk supply, distribution of yeast, voluntary workers, etc.Road Transport Officers, Food Supplies Officers and nuclei of Road Transport Committees have been selected for each of the Districts.Staff for Headquarters in Edinburgh and for Glasgow will be drawn from the Scottish Office and the other Departments in Edinburgh responsible to the Secretary for Scotland..Whitehall Gardens,  S.W..1.
