&apos;  CONFIDENTIAL LIB-if   Wi,nr,H   iVvr.    JiViPMiCn    A ftr[This Document is the Property ot His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]95GERMANY.CONFIDENT!rJune 18, 1925.Section 2[C 8209/459/18]No. 1.Memorandum on the proposed Security Settlement on Germany&apos;s Western Frontier, in its relation to Germany&apos;s Eastern Frontiers.THE main difficulty in the recent conversations with France regarding the German proposals for a Security Pact has been the fear of the French Government lest the proposed pact should result in the Rhineland becoming a barrier which would stop the French from going to the help of Poland in the event of an attack by Germany on that country. It was to provide for this contingency that the French Government, in the first draft of their proposed reply to Germany, suggested that general arbitration treaties between Germany and her eastern neighbours guaranteed by the signatories of the Rhineland Pact should, with that pact and similar arbitra-tion treaties between Germany and the signatories of the pact, form an indivisible whole, and be linked up with them in a general convention. When His Majesty&apos;s Government declared themselves unable to guarantee arbitration treaties between Germany and her eastern neighbours or to participate in a general convention of which such arbitration treaties would be an integral part, the French Government put forward a modified suggestion, reserving to themselves the right to guarantee such treaties, and stipulating that the proposed Rhineland Pact should not be allowed to operate as a barrier against France if she were called upon to implement her guarantee.II. In Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s note to M. Briand of the 8th June His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the idea that France should retain the right to guarantee arbitration treaties between Germany and her eastern neighbours, and agreed that in the circumstances contemplated by the French Government, i.e., assuming the violation by Germany of an arbitration, treaty, voluntarily entered into by her with Poland, in such a manner as to bring into play the guarantee of the French Govern-ment, the Rhineland Pact should not act as a barrier to prevent France from taking action in conformity with her guarantee. His Majesty&apos;s Government justified this attitude by laying down as a general principle that the proposed Rhineland Pact clearly could not be allowed to operate in favour of a signatory Power which subsequently broke treaty obligations into which it had entered. The Rhineland Pact should give the fullest possible security to1 all the Powers concerned, so long as they kept their treaty undertakings and. could not be invoked by a guilty Power to protect it from the consequences of its wrongdoing.III. It is probable that criticism will be directed against the linking tip in any way with the Rhineland Pact of fresh responsibilities in respect of Germany&apos;s eastern frontiers. In order to be in a position to meet this criticism it is necessary to understand clearly how the arrangement will work out in practice. It is with the object of demonstrating this that Sir C. Hurst has written the memorandum which is quoted verbatim below. The memorandum is, of course, to be read subject to one important reservation. The Rhineland Pact and the guaranteed arbitration treaties exist as yet only as conceptions and not as concrete documents. Much will, of course, depend on their actual terms, and it will therefore be prudent at this stage not to be too categorical in any public explanation of their operation. It is quite possible that some of the situations to which the proposed settlement may apparently give rise will not, in fact, materialise, because when the drafting stage is reached it may be possible to introduce safeguards against them. For instance, while the type of arbitration treaty contemplated is a treaty under which all disputes of whatever nature will be submitted to peaceful settlement, the precise form and scope of the guarantee to be given to such an arbitration treaty is not yet settled. Much will turn on this. Again, such apprehensions as now exist will no doubt be greatly diminished should it be found possible so to draft the proposed settlement that the Rhineland can only be crossed for hostile purposes by a party which has behind it the authorisation of the League of Nations. It will be desirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should during the forthcoming negotiations insist on this condition, basing themselves on the principle that the possibility of private war should be ruled[9788 s-2]B
out in the Rhineland, which they regard as an area of vital concern to the security of this country. The way is already prepared for His Majesty&quot;s Government to take up this attitude by the terms of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s memorandum to the French Ambassador of the 19th May. In that memorandum, commenting on the phrase in the French draft note to Germany that the proposed arbitration treaties &quot; should leave no room for coercive action save in case of failure to observe the provisions of the various treaties and agreements contemplated &quot; in the draft note, Mr. Chamberlain wrote :  &quot; But even in the latter case, the French Government can hardly contemplate actual coercive action without a preliminary reference to some procedure for :     peaceful.settlement, such, for example, as the Council of the League of Nations in accordance with the general provisions of the Covenant.&quot;&apos;IV. It is in the light of these preliminary observations that the memorandum by Sir C. Hurst, which now follows, should be read : The Proposed Rhineland Pact in relation to France&apos;s commitments to Poland.Memorandum by Sir C. Hurst.The British policy of separating the arrangements for guaranteeing the &quot;security of the western frontiers of Germany from those relating to the eastern frontiers, coupled with France &apos;s known commitments to Poland and the intention she has announced of guaranteeing an arbitration treaty between Poland and Germany, produces a situation which is somewhat complicated. It is therefore necessary to know exactly the circumstances in which, under the proposed Rhineland Pact, France, acting in support of Poland, will be at liberty to take action against Germany when such action involves measures directed against the Rhineland. It is the point as to which enquiries and criticism are most likely to be made.2. France&apos;s existing engagement to Poland appears to be limited to common action with Poland in the case of unprovoked aggression from Germany. So long, however, as France believes the support and maintenance of Poland t j be essential to France&apos;s security, there can be no certainty that French action would be limited to occasions covered by the treaty. It is French interests, and not French treaty engagements, which will determine the measure of the support to be accorded to Poland. It is well, therefore, to consider every case which can arise.The Security Scheme.3. The elements in the security scheme outlined in the correspondence between the French and British Governments to be borne in mind are (1.) The British guarantee (a) against violation of the Rhineland by either Germany or France; (b) of British support to the other party in case of any failure on the part of either France or Germany to observe the pro-visions of a treaty providing for the peaceful settlement of all disputes between them, where such failure is followed by a resort to hostilities on the part of the wrong-doer.(2.) The French guarantee of support to the other party in case of any failure on the part of either Germany or Poland to observe the provisions of a similar treaty for the peaceful settlement of all disputes between Germany and Poland, where such failure is followed by a resort to hostilities;(3.) Germany&apos;s entry into the League, so that she will come under all the obligations and enjoy all the rights of membership in the League.4. If a dispute between Poland and Germany should arise after all the arrangements indicated in paragraph 3 have come&apos;into being, and Germany should refuse to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement in accordance with the provisions of her arbitration treaty with Poland and should thereupon attack Poland, France will be at liberty to attack Germany and to invade the Rhineland without committing any breach of the Rhineland Pact or involving Great
Britain in any obligation. The Franco-German Arbitration Treaty (see above, paragraph 3 (1) (b) ) is not to exclude coercive action in pursuance ot an arbitra-tioh treaty guaranteed by either party, and the British guarantee cannot be invoked by a guilty Power to protect it from the consequences of a wilful breach of its treaty obligations, but, except in the case where the guilty party resorts to aggression on the western frontier, Great Britain is not involved in any obligation under the proposed pact.5. If in the dispute between Germany and Poland envisaged in para-graph 4 it is Poland which refuses to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement under the Arbitration Treaty between her and Germany, and follows up that refusal by an attack on Germany, France, as the guarantor of the Germano-Polish Treaty, would come under an obligation to support Germany and join in coercing Poland. France would not be at liberty to attack Germany in pursuance of the Franco-Polish military alliance. If France did attack Germany and violate the Rhineland for the purpose, Great Britain would be bound, by virtue of the guarantee of the Rhineland, to support Germany in resisting France.6. Another possible case is that Germany refuses to submit her dispute with Poland to peaceful settlement under the arbitration treaty between them and Poland then resorts to hostilities in consequence and attacks Germany.Germany&apos;s refusal to fulfil the arbitration treaty without resorting to hostilities will have set the Council of the League in motion to use moral pressure on both the parties to settle the dispute and keep the peace. It will not bring France&apos;s guarantee of the Germano-Polish Arbitration Treaty into play, because that guarantee is only to operate where failure to observe it is followed by resort to hostilities. Consequently, France can have no right to support Poland by force of arms or violate the Rhineland. If she did so, the British guarantee of the Rhineland would come into play and His Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound to support Germany. Except in the case corre-sponding to that which is discussed in paragraph 8 below, Poland, by her attack on Germany, would have violated article 16 of the Covenant, and all members of the League, including France and the British Empire, would be bound to apply the sanctions of article 16 against Poland.7. The observations in the above paragraph equally apply, of course, mutatis mutandis, if the case is reversed and it is Poland who refuses to submit the dispute to peaceful settlement under her arbitration treaty with Germany and Germany who attacks her in consequence. In that case, too, France&apos;s guarantee of the Germano-Polish Arbitration Treaty will not come into play, because the refusal to submit the dispute to arbitration will not have been coupled with a resort to hostilities. Consequently, France will not, under the Rhineland Pact, have any right to violate the Rhineland; the coercive action involved in such an attack would not be in pursuance of a treaty of arbitration guaranteed by her.Germany&apos;s action, however, will have been taken in disregard of the League subject to the exception discussed in paragraph 8 below. Poland&apos;s refusal to submit her dispute to peaceful settlement under the arbitration treaty with Germany will have brought the Council of the League into action, and the Council of the League will be endeavouring to secure that effect is given to toe arbitration treaty. Consequently, Germany&apos;s attack on Poland will have violated article 16 of the Covenant, and France will be entitled, under that article, to regard Germany&apos;s attack on Poland as an act of war committed against herself and to apply against Germany the sanctions provided by that article. Such action will not violate the Rhineland Pact, nor bring the British guarantee to protect the Rhineland into play. The British Empire, as a member of the League, will be in the same position as France, and should apply as against Germany the sanctions of article 16 of the Covenant, because of Germany&apos;s resort to war in disregard of her obligations as a member of the League.8. It is possible that the attack made by Germany on &apos; Poland (see paragraph 7), after Poland&apos;s refusal to submit the matter to peaceful settle-ment, will have been made after the Council of the League has done its utmost to secure compliance on the part of Poland with the provisions of the arbitration treaty and after Germany has taken all the steps which are provided for in the Covenant of the League, so that under the Covenant her resort to war[978 s-2] b 2
against Poland would be justifiable. She will have violated no treaty engage-ment; France would have no right to take measures against Germany, either under the Covenant of the League or under the Rhineland Pact, or under the Germano-Polish Arbitration Treaty of which she would be a guarantor. If France did move against Germany and violated the Rhineland Pact in so doing, it would, bring into play the British guarantee of the inviolability of the Rhineland and would oblige Great Britain to come to the support of Germany.9. One further hypothesis needs consideration, as it has already been mentioned in the newspapers.Suppose Germany fails to carry out her arbitration treaty with Poland and attacks Poland, so that France&apos;s guarantee of the treaty comes into play. France then proceeds to attack Germany across the Rhineland (as she is entitled to do), but her armies are not successful; they are driven back by the Germans, and the Gernmn forces Droceed to march across the Rhineland and invade France. Would such entry into the-Rhineland violate the new pact? From the strictly legal point of view, it would be difficult to say that Germany&apos;s action in defending herself against France made her a wrongdoer as against France, even though she was a wrongdoer in the first instance against Poland. If France chooses to attack Germany, she cannot claim that Germany is not to be allowed to defend herself to the best of her ability, and Germany&apos;s defence of herself must include the right to attack and defeat her enemy. If the Rhineland Pact is not to prevent France attacking Germany in fulfilment of the guarantee of the Germano-Polish Treaty, it must not prevent Germany defending herself when so attacked. At the same time it must be realised that Germany&apos;s original action against Poland would in all probability have already brought article 16 of the Covenant into operation, so that we might be involved in action (not necessarily military) against Germany in virtue of our obligations under the Covenant, though not under the pact.If Ger.rnany&apos;s action in repelling such French attack involves no breach of the pact, neither would it bring into operation the British guarantee which is contained in the pact. Politically, it may well be that circumstances would compel Great Britain to intervene in such a case, but intervention would be dictated by British interests, and not by the Rhineland Pact.C. J. B. Hurst.Foreign Office, June 17, 1925.V. A contention which is likely to be advanced by critics of the proposed settlement is that the introduction of the idea of arbitration treaties between Germany and her eastern neighbours guaranteed by France has the practical result of involving Great Britain indirectly in commitments regarding the German eastern frontier. The answer to this is that under the terms of the Covenant of the League, Great Britain, as a member of the League, is already liable in certain circumstances to be involved should war break out between Germany and Poland. It is true that the proposed settlement will leave the liabilities of France in respect of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier greater than those assumed by other members of the League of Nations, but it will greatly restrict the freedom of either Poland or France or Germany to provoke hostilities and be far safer than the present Franco-Polish Treaty of Alliance; and further, His Majesty&apos;s Government will not be bound to any greater extent than they are at present by the Covenant to defend Poland&apos;s frontier against Germany, or vice versa. The only case that can be put forward with any show of justification to prove that Great Britain&apos;s liabilities are increased by the French guarantee of a German-Polish arbitration treaty is the case discussed in paragraph 9 of Sir C. Hursfs memorandum, i.e., if France, in virtue of her guarantee, made a legitimate attack on Germany and that attack failed, Great Britain might find herself bound to come to the help of France if Germany, in a successful &quot;counter-attack, crossed the Rhineland. It will be observed that Sir C. Hurst is doubtful whether, even in this case, the Rhineland Pact would entail upon Great Britain any legal obligation to intervene. But assuming, for the purpose of argument, that Great Britain did find herself compelled to intervene  and indeed, wdiatever the legal position might be under the Rhineland Pact, it is almost inconceivable that in the situation contemplated Great Britain would not intervene either in virtue of obligations under the League Covenant or from sheer political necessity -the possibility still does not constitute a fresh liability in respect of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier.   The most that can be said about it with any show
of justification is that it increases our liabilities in respect of the Rhineland. But the whole basis of our policy is that the Rhineland is an area of such vital concern to us that we are prepared to use force to resist any unlawful incursion into that area.VI. For the sake of completeness mention must be made of one other point which, though not really relevant, has already been raised in the press and which may be raised again. It has been assumed in some quarters that as a result of the Rhineland Pact and its cognate arrangements France will not only have the right to cross the Rhineland in certain circumstances to attack Germany in support of Poland, but will also acquire the right to send troops in transit across Germany to help Poland in the event of a Russian attack upon Poland. This, of course, is incorrect. The right to send troops in transit across Germany can only be claimed under paragraph 3 of article 16 of the Covenant of the League, which reads as follows : &quot;The members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting from the above measures, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the Covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.&quot;At present Germany, not being a member of the League, is not bound to allow French troops to cross her territory, and it is her objection to assuming this obligation that is the main ostensible reason for her reluctance to join the League. The view of the Council of the League is that if Germany desires to become a member of the League she must accept this obligation with the rest of the Covenant. Now, the Allies are insisting that Germany must join the League before the Rhineland Pact can come into force. It therefore follows that when the Rhineland Pact comes into force Germany will be under the theoretical obligation to allow the transit of French troops if so required by the League. But it should be clearly understood that this is the effect of Germany&apos;s entry into the League and not of the Rhineland Pact, which does not itself affect or aim at affecting the question in any way.Foreign Office, June 18, 1925.
