REPORT.lo At their meeting on July 28th 1925 (Cabinet 40(25)) theCabinet agreed that a Committee composed as follows :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer     fin the Chair)The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,Tho Attorney-General,The Secretary for Mines,should investigate the question of the State purohase or Statecontrol of Mining Royalties and the conditions subject to whichthis might take place*     The Committee submit the following report.2. All our reflections lead us to believe that no effectivepart could be played In the present emergency by an announcement that the Government are in favour either of a policy of the simultaneous acquisition by the State of mineral royalties, or of some less drastic solution of the problem on the lines indicated below.3o In any case we are opposed to and cannot recommend theCabinet to entertain a scheme for the simultaneous acquisition by the State of mineral royalties for the reasons set out in the Appendix     to this Report.-   of4o After examination of various alternative methods/dealingwith the question,, we draw attention to the following Schemes A, B, and 0 respectively.     Having regard to the shortness of the time at our disposal it has not been possible for us to give that detailed consideration to the Schemes which the3^
: 473importance of the subject natter demands.     We do not think, therefore, that any of these Schemes could be accepted as satis-factory in their present form, but should it become necessary to adopt one of them on general grounds, the preference of a majority of us would be indicated by the order in which the Schemes are set out.     It is, we feel,  for the Cabinet to decide which, if any, of the policies comprised in the three Schemes in question should be adopted.SCHEME   a*Scheme for the gradual acquisition of Mineral Royalties by the State&quot;1.     Adopt in principle the scheme of gradual acquisition of mineral royalties for the State by purchase, viz;-a. State to acquire unworked minerals only when it is proposed to work them.b. State to acquire minerals now leased or worked only when, after termlnation of existing working, another person ?/ishes to work them: subject always to the right of the State,  if necessary, to acquire such minerals during the currency of an existing lease or working and, if desirable in the national interest, to cancel the lease with proper compensation and grant a fresh one*2*       Form a register during the next five years of all existing mineral rights claims.    Apply the scheme of gradual acquisition to all properties on the register, purchasing them as required at their value at the moment of acquisition.3.       If no claim is registered within 5 years, the right to make a claim for compensation shall lapse.4.       Claimants shall assess the values they put upon their own mineral rights, and the State shall have the option to acquire these rights at any time within five years from the date of regis-tration at such valuation or after 5 years at a value to be. determined.5. Such valuation shall be deemed to be the value for the pur-pose of Death Duty unless at the time of death a higher valuationis established.     The owner can at any time withdraw his mineral rights from the register, and his claim for compensation will then lapse. s*
Scheme for the extension-:of the IvlineejiWorking &quot;fabilIties land&quot; Su^orT) AcT7&quot;&apos;l925&quot;.(Submitted by the President of the Board of Trade. )I have been ashed to set out briefly what extension of the Mines (Working facilities) Act would be necessary in order to secure the most efficient working of the mines.In putting forward, the following suggestions, I do not wish to exaggerate the benefit which could be obtained.     There might be considerable benefit in a limited number of mines;    but  if a calculation could be made at the ond of a period when full facility powers had been in operation,  I doubt whether the calculation would show a substantial decrease in cost per ton over the whole mining area.      In the limited eases where the facilities would be of value, no doubt there would be considerable benefit on working costs.It is not easy to say with precision exactly how far some of the powers I suggest could be enforced under the existing Law, because the Act has only been in force a comparatively short time, and the Court has construed its powers liberally.      Lut construed as liberally as possible, there are very considerable limitations to these powers.The full powers I suggest would be as follows:-1.    Complete control in the granting of future leases of
not now in lease, in order that the coal may be leased to the mine owner who can work it to the best advantage.      -phis does not necessarily mean that control would be exercised in the majority of cases.      Hie majority of leases are made to the most suitable owner.      It does mean  that there should be a Statutory Power to  compel a lease to he granted to A rather than to B,  if that is in the national interest.     &apos; This proposal involves interference with the free contractual right of the landlord only.2. There should be the right to require that coal now inlease to A should be  transferred to B.      This involves not merely the control of the landlord but the power to vary a third partyTs contractual rights.      The power is,  I believe desirable,   though its use should be   warily exercised.    The Scott Committee suggested that it might be limited to cases where it is proved that there is a danger of the minerals being permanently lost, or that there will be such delay in development as to prejudice the national interest.      I would certainly exercise the power in such a case.     When you come to a case where it is alleged that an adjoining owner will work the coal better or cheaper, you are on much more difficult ground.     You may easily create such uncertainty over the whole industry that this outweighs the direct benefit. &apos;   I should hesitate to commit myself on this without full discussion with colliery owners.It should be a condition of any such Order under (2) that B should compensate A;    and there should also be power for the Sanctioning Authority to order that the transfer should not take place unless B is willing to take over all ATs area.&apos;   ^Such a power might very likely lead to desirable amalgamations.
3. Power to relieve from onerous terms in leases,including rent.This is, of course, equivalent to setting up a- Rent Court.. But is it reasonable that, however adverse mining conditions may have become, the tenant should be unable to obtain any relief from the royalty owner.I think (1) and possibly (3) might be exercised by the department of Mines,  subject to an appeal to the Railway and Canal Commission.      probably (S) ought always to go to the CoUrtj.Hie 3cott Report, in its 14- points, attempted to deal with bad management.      I do not believe this is possible, except in so far as it can be used to support the claim of one mine owner to an area of coal as against another mineowner. If the Department is to attempt to enforce a; particular standard of management, you are logically driven to the conclusion at which the Scott Committee in fact arrived,  that the Department must be prepared to take over and run the pit, Ih-is would be the worst form of nationalisation.The power to g rant facilities, however, would be a. useful lever to force amalgamations.. If the above powers are all that can reasonably be sought in the interests of efficient working, it seems to me impossible to base a case for nationalisation of royalties on these facts,  since the powers can be exercined without nationalisation.     flor will nationalisation by itself give the State the powers sought under (2) above, because nati on-alisation will merely create a common lessor, it will not vary  the contractual rights of separate lessees.
An Expert Conmittee-of Enquiry.A third course which might be taken is that the Prime Minister should appoint an expert Committee to consider and advise whether any and what steps can be taken to bring about an improvement in the organisation, development and management of the mining industry.      Such a Committee would, consider the suggestions for that purpose contained in the Report of the recent Court of Inquiry, and would also be at liberty to consider the two schemes above described.Signed on behalf of the Committee WIN ST 01?

APP3ITOIZ 478OBJECTIONS TO THE SIilUIM^OUS ACQUISITION BY TH3 STATS OF MIJSSRAIi ROYALTIES.Tiie. administrative difficulties of any scheme inwhich all the coal in -the country simultaneously changes from private to public ownership are very great, though not perhaps. insuperable c      To make a complete valuation in a limited time,  involving as it would the examination of the claims ofvast numbers of small land-owners who thought, rightly orwrongly, that there was coal under their small plots of land,would be a gigantic task.      To create upwards of  100,000,000of fresh debt is not a course to be undertaken lightly.    Topresent a.man who is already a millionaire with the equivalent of perhaps another million of public money is open to political attack.      The necessity for examining every coalmining lease in the country, of separating what relates tothe minerals from what relates to the surface (not always an easy task) and of adjusting in each the new tripartiterelationship between  the lessee,  the Department as minerallessor, and the  ex-royalty owner as surface lessor, presentsan administrative problem of the first magnitude.      The largeadditions that would be necessary to the staffs of the InlandRevenue and the Mines Department would not commend themselvesto public opinion.      It would be difficult to maintain,  onutilitarian grounds,  that so cumbrous a hammer was necessaryLeslie Scottto crack the comparatively small nut of the XIV points, of the/Report, especially when its opponents could point to what they would claim was another hammer of much more manageable size and qui adequate for the job (the extension of the Working 1&apos;facilities Act) lying ready to hand.      The case would be different if nationalisation meant that the industry would be relieved of the burden of royalties.    But it has never been suggested that that is possible except on a scheme of expropriation without compensation.
