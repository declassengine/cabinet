THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SAFEGUARDING   OF    INDUS TRIES. GAS   MANTLES. Memorandum by the President of the -Board of Trade.I attach the Report of the Committee on Gas Mantles.------ s.The Committee recommend that a duty of  6/- per gross should be imposed on imported mantles *The Report of the Committee is not very definite on some points;   but I understand the Report to mean that, although there is no exchange bounty or Government subsidy, the other conditions laid down in the White Paper, including disparity in labour conditions, are all present in a greater or less degree.     Apart from this, the Committee are quite definitely of opinion that thorium and other rare earth metals are vital key industries and that the preservation of the gas mantle industry is essential, if the production of thorium and the other rare metals is to be maintained.     They arrive at the following conclusion (para, 49).We are clear that it is a choice between giving reasonable help to this industry and maintaining the thorium and cerium industries in some other way of which we have no indication.     Should the former course be chosen by the Government a flat rate not exceeding 5/- per gross (equivalent to one halfpenny per mantle) would in our opinion enable the Mantle industry, reorganised and concentrated as it might be, to maintain Itself In a healthy state.SECRET.CABINET.CP.381 (26).
The Cabinet will remember that when the list of Key .Industries was being considered, it was argued that gas mantles ought to be included, firstly, on the ground that, without their inclusion, the protection of thorium, etc., was likely to be ineffective! and secondly on the ground that the gas mantle wa3 necessary in order to enable gas to be stripped for the manufacture of munitions.     The findings of the Committee confirm this   argument.Gas mantles were not included as a key industry on the understanding it would be open to the industry to claim protection under Part II of the Act;   and it was, in fact, subsequently so protected.Accordingly, I recommend that the Cabinet should approve the duty proposed by the Committee, and that publication of the Report should be deferred until the Government are able to introduce a Finance Bill.(Intld.)

SAFEGUARDING   OP   INDUSTRIES.REPORTbyCOMMITTEEAppointed by the President of the Board of Trade to enquire into and report upon an application made by the Incandescent Mantle Manufacturers&apos; Association, for the imposition of a duty onGAS   M A N T L E S.
GAS MANTLE COMMUTES.To The Right Hon.Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C, M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,By Minute of the Board of Trade dated 25th April, 1925, we were appointed a committee &quot;to enquire into and report upon an application made by the Incandescent Mantle Manufacturers1 Association, in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum relating to Prooedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries, presented to Parliament on the 3rd February,. 1925, for the imposition of a duty on Gas Mantles&quot;.2, \ie have held nine meetings, including four for the taking of evidence in public, and have heard 20 witnesses, including several whose evidence was from the nature of the case confidential,     A list of the witnesses who gave evidence before us on behalf of the Applicants and the Opponents is given in an Appendix.3. The Applicants&apos; case was conducted by Mr. J.P.H. Soper, Managing Director of Monarch Mantles, Limited,&quot;   and Mr. N.L. Macaskie, instructed by Messrs. Here, Pattisson and Bathurst, appeared in opposition on behalf of a Group of Gas Mantle Importers and V/holesalers of the London Chamber of Commerce and others.4. The Applicants&apos; complaint under the White Paper was directed against competition from four Continental countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Italy. It soon became clear to us, however, that the case really turned upon the question of German competition, since imports from Germany represent the bulk of the imports from all sources.     By concentrating our attention in the main upon German competition we have been able to report a/t an earlier date than would otharwise have been possible.
I, Importance of the Industry.5. The first question to which we are required by the terms of the Yifhite Paper to address ourselves Is :-&quot;whether the applicant industry is, by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an industry of substantial importance&quot;.6. The Applicants themselves make no claim that it should be regarded as important in volume.     Even in the year 1920, when foreign competition was very small, the number of workers employed barely reached 3,300 and during--the last three years the average has been 1,624.7. Their claim to &quot;substantial importance&quot; is based upon the nature of the goods produced.     The gas mantle, whatever its future here or elsewhere, is still an article of very widespread and popular use.     Its invention brought about a great increase in the illuminating power obtainable from a given quantity of coal gas, and it has been at the root of the development of the gas industry in recent years by making possible concentration upon calorific power for lighting as well as for heating.8. It has been put to us that during the War national needs made it necessary to &quot;strip&quot; gas of benzol, toluol, etc, which were required for munitions.     This process reduced the lighting power of a flat flame burner to so low a point that in some areas gas could not have been &quot;stripped but for the mantle.     Fortunately, in spite of our pre-war dependence upon Germany for certain essential materials, our Mantle industry (aided by imported supplies of mantles) was expanded to meet national needs.
9. V.hile the gas mantle may not possess in another emergency the significance from this point of view which it had during the late war, we think it is never -theless important that mantles should continue to be manufactured to a substantial extent in this country.10. It has further been put to us that this Industry provides the only serious commercial outlet for compounds of thorium and cerium, which are scheduled as Key Industry products under Part I of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921.     If gas mantles were no longer made here, the thorium nitrate industry (which was for the first time firmly established during the war) would again be lost.     With it would go also British supplies of cerium and meso thorium, and compounds of the rare earth metals which are obtained as by-products of thorium manufacture.     Cerium compounds were during the late war of great Importance to the fighting services in that flame arc carbons, required for searchlights, demanded large quantities of cerium fluoride;   and other uses of importance are to be found in connection with the manu-facture of special glasses, luminous compounds for aero-plane   equipment, compasses and gun mountings,11. We find that, the gas mantle industry is to be regarded as of substantial importance by reason of the nature of the article produced. II. Foreign Competition.12. The second question upon which we are required to report is&quot;whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being
imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities&quot;. 13. Information furnished by the Applicants on the quantity of British manufactured mantles sold in each year from 1920, with particulars of imports and exports compiled by the Customs, has produoed the following tabular statement of the division of the British market as between home produoed and imported mantles******	Total Sales for British. Consumption	British Production less &quot;Exports.		Retained	Imports			Per Cent.		Per Cent.	Gross.	Gross.	of Total.

Imports reached their peak in 1922, and have fallen slight-ly since, till the $resent year.     In the first si,x months of 1925 113,211 gross have come In, against 62,866 gross for the corresponding period of 1924.15. In interpreting these figures, it is necessary to bear in mind that for some   21% months between the end of October, 1922, and the middle of August, 1924, imports of gas mantles from Germany were subject to a duty of 33^ per cent, imposed under Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921.     Imports from Germany were undoubtedly stimulated in anticipation of the duty, and they fell off while the duty was in force.     This is indicated broadly in the following table showing total imports of mantles from all countries in each of thea*5**

The falling off in imports from Germany in 1923 would probably have been heavier but for the very rapid depreciation of the German mark which was then taking place.     German manufacturers were able to make a paper profit while selling at almost any level of prices they chose, and they lowered their prices to this country virtually by the amount of the duty.     Being levied on an ^d valorem basis, moreover, the effectiveness of the duty became less as the need for it (consequent upon a reduction by whatever means of the import valuation) became greater.17. Imports from countries other than Germany also increased in 1923 (fostered in part by currency depreciation), and the British manufacturers experienced little benefit from the duty in that year.     It was not till the earlier months of 1924, prior to the withdrawal of the duty, that they derived appreciable benefit from It.     \iie were informed by a German witness, one of the managing directors of the largest German mantle works, that following the stabilisation of the mark in November, 1923, the German manufacturers were at last able to keepyears 192-0*4Total Imports of Gas Mantles.
accurate costs accounts and that they then found it more difficult than before to cut prices.16. The Applicants complained that during the last quarter of 1924, after the duty had been removed, the proportion of foreign imports to total sales increased substantially to some 43 per cent, of the trade.     This was probably due in some measure, however, to pastpone-ment of importation pending the removal of the Tariff.     On the other hand, the increase of imports during the present year is due in part, we think, to anticipation of a possible tariff as a result of the present Application.19. In attempting to determine whether the recent competition of foreign imports is abnormal, it is necessary to have in mind a standard of normal competition for the industry.     We do not think, (and the Opponents do not claim) that in the particular case of the gas mantle trade, such a standard can be found in the experience of the year 1913, when the proportion of imported mantles -while not accurately ascertainable - was certainly much higher than it has been at any time since the war.     The gas mantle industry in this country was at that time to a considerable extent In German hands, and existed largely on sufferance, owing to the control which the Germans exeroised over supplies of monazite sand and the thorium industry.     During the war the Travancore deposits of monazite sand   were freed from German control, the manu-facture of thorium and cerium was established in this country, the German hold over the gas mantle Industry here was released, and the equipment of the industry was greatly extended.20. The year 1920 appears to us to be equally inapplicablewith 1913, inasmuch as Germany was not then in a positionto export, and retained imports from all countries represented less than 17 per cent, of British consumption.The Opponents ask that the year 1921 or possibly 1922-7-
be regarded as the normal year.    Our own conclusion is that this is a case where, owing to the facts stated, above, past years afford no standard at all of what is normal.     But we observe that the average importations during the years 1921-4 were at a rate which did in fact cause the machinery of the British factories to be largely unemployed. III. post of British and Foreign Mantles.21. With a view to answering the question&quot;Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom&quot; we obtained cost accounts of each of the four principal British mantle factories, and similar figures were given to us by the Opponents relating to the largest German works, which claim to supply more than half the gas mantles imported into this country.     We also obtained figures of selling prices, costs of the principal materials in this country and abroad, and wages.     Much of the information obtained was confidential and we are, therefore, not at liberty to set out the position in full detail.22. Evidence was tendered to us that the German prime cost of mantles is considerably lower than the British. The same applies to factory on-costs and overhead charges for administration and selling.     High overhead charges are no doubt largely a result of the reduced volume of trade handled by the English manufacturer a3 a result of foreign competition, and also of the heavy expenses necessary to keep the trade in advertised brands,23. With regard to prime cost, Germany, as will be shown later, possesses an&apos;advantage in cheaper labour.     The applicants urged that German mantle producers benefit
also through the cheaper labour In the other industries which produce materials for them, and we find that the German mantle makers are paying substantially less than the English manufacturers for thorium and clay rings.     In regard to thorium, however, the position is equalised so far as* German mantles sent to this country are concerned by the flat rate import duty of 9d. per gross of mantles representing Key Industry Duty upon the thorium content. In regard to other materials there appears to be little difference of price between this country and Germany, \nd the difference is not always in favour of the German mantle maker,24. We were informed that the British mantle manufactur-ers maintain a price association which practically eliminates price competition between them, and that the cheaper British mantles are sold at a price which shows a definite loss,     German mantles of similar quality are. Offered here at an even lower price;   but the German witness already referred to assured us not only that German quota-/ tions, whether for home consumption or for export, are now fixed with close regard to cost of production, but that his company at any rate do not sell eves the cheaper lines at a loss.     He Informed, us also that German manufacturers no longer have a price convention, but sell under conditions of free competition,25. Speaking generally, we find that there is a substantial margin bebweon the prices at which foreign mantles are sold to tho wholesaler in this country and the figures at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured here and sold to the wholesaler.
IV. Effects of Foreign Competition on Employment.26. The next question which we are required to consider is : -&quot;whether by reason of the severity and extentof such competition, employment in the manufacture or production of such goods in the United Kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected&quot;. 27. The Applicants have furnished the following figures relating to output, sales and employment since thebeginning of 1920.			i	1 Average	i     Average	&quot; &apos; Total&apos;	[Quantity [Quantity			j No. of	No. of hours	hours		Made	j    Sold	i workers	W worked	V? worked		gross.	1 gross.	:per week.	per week.

28. It can be seen that the numbers employed have not varied greatly in the last three years, and the hours worked have risen somewhat;   but in both respects the industry has been employed much below the full capacity of its buildings and plant.Fairness or Unfairness of. the Foreign Competition.29. The fifth question, which is put to us is stated in the white Paper as follows&quot;Whether such exceptional competion comes largely from countries where the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair. &quot;Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed unfair unless it arises from one or more of the following causes(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as tocreate an export bounty.(b) Subsidies, bounties or other artificialadvantages.(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour,whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise, obtaining amongst the persons employed in the production of the imported goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the production of similar goods in the United Kingdom&quot; ,&quot;In making their report upon the alleged unfairness of the competition, the Committee may call attention to any special circumstances by reason of which, in their opinion, the industry in the United Kingdom is placed at a serious relative disadvantage&quot;.30. As already stated, the Applicants complained originally of unfair competition from Germany, Poland, Austria and Italy;   but the figures given earlier in our report
justify us, we hold, in concentrating our attention upon the case of Germany.31. Depreciation of currency ceased to exist in Germany after the stabilisation of the mark, and though the Applicants represented that permanent effects had been produced making for cheaper production compared with British conditions, they did not lay stress on this matter nor try to prove their contention In detail.     Nor did they seriously attempt to show that German competition was unfair by reason of subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages.     They rested their case under this Section chiefly on the inferior conditions of labour in Germany.32, v;e find that the English mantle factories pay wages fixed from time to time by the Joint Industrial council for the industry with reference to the Cost of Living Index. Current minimum time-rates paid to female operatives, who constitute about 95 per cent, of the employees in the Industry, are as follows14 to 15 years.....15 to 16 .....16 to 17     &quot;    .....17 to 18 years.....18 years and over..Pencetper hour.Learners 1st 4 months     2nd 4 monthso2.3f 4-f5m3 4 5 6Piece workers, who in some factories represent a majority of the hands, are paid at rates so arranged as to enable the worker of average ability to earn 25 per cent, above the hourly time rate.

Normal hours, as in this country, are 48,* and although they can be extended to 54 the witness stated that in fact the operatives refuse to work more than 48 hours.34. The same witness gave us the following further table, showing how recently and how sharply the skilled wage has risen to its present level	Hourly rates for skilled women.				18 - 19 years.

(3f) (4f) (5) (5*)we observe, therefore, that while present German skilled wages may be only Id. per hour below British, this evidence h *s to be taken without the safeguards of working experience or the comparison of similar German trades.35. The Applicants, on the other hand, put in tables of German wages showing an average rate for skilled workers hardly more than half the British rate.     These Tables were compiled on on figures collected for them under conditions which prevent our relying on their completeness or accuracy.36. We are iaaclined. therefore, on a review of this con-conflicting evidence., to accept the facts laid before us on both sides (the best available to us in the time and by the methods33. The German witness for the Opponents handed, us a copy of an Agreement regulating wages and conditions of work in the Chemical Industry in the Berlin district.     He states that his company had adhered to the Agreement and that it applied to the gas mantle operatives.     Under this Agreement the hourly rates payable to female workers as from 2nd May, 1925, are t-
at our disposal) with a considerable measure of reserve, VI. Efficiency of the Industry.37. V.e are asked to report :-&quot;whether the applicant industry is being carried on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy&quot; ,38. From the point of view of factory organisation and equipment we have reason to believe that there is no great difference between English and foreign factories. l&quot;e heard at considerable length the views of all parties on this question, but It would be impossible to make sure how English and foreign factories compare without a thorough examination of the principal works here and abroad.39. Subject to this reservation, we are certainly of opinion that the English factories are efficiently equipped and worked.40. We think, however, that in regard to factory on-costs and in regard to general overhead and administration expenses there is room for considerable improvement.     No doubt high on-costs are partly a consequence of unused productive capacity at the -works, while selling and administration expenses are inevitably increased when a large part of the staple trade in non-advertised proprietary brands and in so called &quot;own name&quot; brands (i,e,, mantles sold to dealers who sell them in boxes with their own name marked on) is lost.     We were struck, however, by the fact that the German works whose costs were shown to us had comparatively much lower overhead charges, notwithstanding that the output was said to be substantially less than before the war,     A natural way of reducing overhead charges would be by means of greater concentration in the industry.
VII* Effects of a duty on using industries. 41. We are asked to report&quot;Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment in any other industry, being an industry using goods of that class or description in production.&quot; Our answer to this question is No. VIII. Desirability of imposing a duty.42. Lastly, we are asked to report&quot;Whether, having regard to the above conditions, the applicant Industry has, in the opinion of the Committee, established a claim to a duty;   and if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition&quot;. 43. We may here summarise the conclusions reached. The British Gas Mantle Industry is certainly not able in its present state to meet its chief foreign competitor on equal terms.     We do not think that it is likely to go under, but it may well dwindle into the production of special brands only.     The German mantle undersells the corresponding British mantle, not heavily but quite definitely;   and the home Industry is, in consequence, working much below its full capacity,44. We do not think that the German conditions to-day, in respect either of the exchange or of selling methods, amount to unfairness as contemplated in our terms of reference.     The difference in wage rates appears to be not very great at the present time, although in this connection we would refer to our remarks in paragraphs 34 - 36 above.     It is to be presumed, that if the home industry were concentrated in its production and its capital outlay, it might, as was hoped of it in
1920, stand on Its own feet, though we think that the lower priced mantle will always be very much a &quot;cut&quot; article.45.   We cannot, therefore, conclude that the industry, under the present conditions (which did not exist in 1922) of a stabilised mark and rising wage costs in Germany, has made good this part of its case.46. But the matter is otherwise when we revert to &quot;the nature of the article produced&quot;.   It is not that the gas mantle as such as an essential or national value.    Its use is no doubt widespread and its value incontestable; and in time of war to be deprived of it (however remote that danger might be) would be a heavy disadvantage.   But that Is equally true of many other articles of general use; and without it gas could and would still be &quot;stripped&quot; and used for heating purposes, if the supply of explosives were the chief object.    The significance of the mantle lies first and last in the fact that it is practically the sole commercial outlet for thorium, which in its turn has been described to us as &quot;the bread and butter&quot; of a group of secondary chemical products, &quot;compounds of thorium and cerium and other rare earth metals&quot;.4V. Without going into detail on this part of the evidence we accept the broad fact that the continued production In this country of thorium and cerium is imperative; and we are satisfied that if mantles were not made here the economic production of thorium and cerium would go also, as there is apparently no prospect that they would find a sale abroad.48.   When these industries were scheduled as key industries in 1921 It was, we understand, in the expectation that the mantle industry would be strong enough to ensure their production here, since their sources of supply had been freed from monopoly.   That has not proved to be the case.   The future of these two products is undoubtedly threatened by the
present pressure on the Mantle Industry.49.    we are clear that it is a choice between giving reasonable help to this industry and maintaining the thorium and cerium industries in some other way of whioh we have no Indication.   Should the former course be chosen by the Government a flat rate not exceeding 6/- per gross (equivalent to one halfpenny per mantle) would in our opinion enable the Mantle industry, reorganised and concentrat ed as it might be, to maintain itself in a healthy state.50. We cannot end this report without expressing our warm acknowledgment of the -work done by our Secretary, Mr. CK. Hobs on, throughout the enquiry; particularly in summarizing the evidence, and thus lightening our task in reaching our c-inclusions .(Signed)Fred..        Mills (Chairman). J. Arthur Alton. John N.
