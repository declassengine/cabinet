Paper No. 572-B.)(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 194th Meeting, Minute 8.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff on the strategical aspect of the situation in Egypt (C.I.D. Paper No. 572-B).LORD BEATTY said he had nothing to add to the Report, and that the Summary of Recommendations in the Report adequately expressed his views.lord CAVAN concurred, adding that he did not agree with the latter part of the note by the Chief of the Air Staff.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD adhered to his opinion that if it was necessary to move troops out of Egypt owing to political reasons, then the Canal could be defended by the same number of troops stationed in the vicinity of the Canal if a large sum of money were first expended in making the necessary stations.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that when he was in Egypt some two months ago influential Egyptians, including King fuad, had not seemed to expect the British Government would make any change in the dispositions of its troops in Egypt. King Fuad had mentioned the need for an agreement in the course of three or four years, but had made no mention of military dispositions.Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said that this question of the strategical aspect of the situation in Egypt had been referred to the Chiefs of Staff by his predecessor (Mr. Ramsay MacDonald), and on this Government coming into power he had considered that the Chiefs of Staff should complete their enquiry. He entirely accepted the Report. [13243 b]
Conclusions.THE COMMITTEE agreed:-To approve the Report of the Chiefs of Staff on the strategical aspect of the situation in Egypt (C.I.D. Paper No. 572-B), the summary of recom-mendation of which is as follows : &quot; (1.) That in any .agreement which is made with the Egyptian Government, arrangements should be made whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government should have &quot; (a.) The power to place military patrols on the banks of the Canal and such Naval and Air Forces for patrolling the Canal or holding the entrances to the Canal as and when they think necessary.&quot; (b.) Sufficient forces in Egypt to provide and protect the forces mentioned above.&quot; (2.) That the Military and Air Forces required by (1) (b) above should be substantially the same, except for the temporary reinforcement of one Cavalry Regiment and one Infantry Battalion, as the forces now in Egypt, and that they should hold Cairo and the immediate surroundings as at present.&quot;(3.) that if for political reasons, it is considered necessary to give up the military occupation of Cairo and its immediate vicinity, then the safety of the Canal might, still be provided for, but it would be a difficult and costly operation entailing in all pro-bability the dispatch of an Expeditionary Force and the risk of sabotage to the Canal in the interval while the necessary military protection was being arranged.&quot;******II.STRATEGICAL ASPECT OF SITUATION IN EGYPT.(Previous C.I.D. Papers Nos. 43S-B, 439-B, 446 B, 448-B, 450-B, 453-B, 454-B; 457-B, 462-B, 466-B, 475-R, 478-B, 514-B, 515-B and 520-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff.THE Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee at the time of the conversations between the late Prime Minister and Zaghlul Pasha in October last was considering the strategical aspect of British policy towards Egypt [OLD. 188th Meeting, Minute 1]; owing to the fact that the conversations were broken off before agreement had been reached, and owing to the whole political situation being changed through the murder of Sir Lee Stack on the 19th November, no report was submitted at that time to the Committee of Imperial Defence.A request has, however, recently been received that a report should be submitted on the strategical aspect of the situation as it exists at present, and accordingly, a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff was held on the 27th January, when the following i*eport was drawn up.We have accepted as the basis of this Report the need for securing the safety of our vital communications through Egypt, this basis having already been accepted by the Committee of Imperial Defence, and further we have considered the measures necessary to ensure the safety of these communications in conditions as they exist to-day.The communications which it is essential to guarantee are the Suez Canal and the air communications to the Near and Middle East. These air communications really mean the use of Egypt as an advance base for the Air Force for Palestine, Iraq or India, and entail the protection of the aerodromes and
the other necessary Air Force establishments. All the protection in this respect that is really required could be provided by ground troops stationed at or near Alexandria, and provided that the safety of the Canal is guaranteed by ground forces, this is more than sufficient for the protection of the necessary Air Force establishments.The question of guaranteeing the safety of the Suez Canal is, however, a much more difficult problem. There are two dangers which have to be provided against an organised military attack, possibly by Egypt as being in a position to deliver such an attack most easily, and an act of sabotage.Against organised military attack a comprehensive defence is necessary, and this can only be arranged if based on a secure hold on Egypt itself. The defence of the Canal must be organised in depth, a shallow line along the Canal itself being impossible; such an arrangement would lose the resources, communications and supplies of Egypt, would place control of the entire fresh water supply of the Canal zone in foreign hands, and condemn the troops to remain in unhealthy surroundings with none of the ordinary amenities of life. For these purely military reasons we consider British troops should remain in Egypt in their present positions.There are, however, other reasons which confirm us in this view. Should we withdraw our troops from Cairo, we think that this action would be recognised as being a weakening of British power; that symptoms of unrest would be generally increased, and that there would he the probability of other Powers endeavouring by degrees to usurp our place in the country.There is also the question of communications with the Sudan; in that country, although no further outbreaks have occurred since the recent mutiny was quelled, it cannot yet be considered that the situation is really stable. Further, a new regime has recently been established there; a British Governor-General and a British Sirdar have been appointed; a Defence Force with British officers has been constituted. It is therefore essential for the safety of the Sudan to show no weakening of our position in Egypt.Turning now to an act of sabotage which is, in our opinion, the danger to winch the Canal is more likely to be subjected and which we consider has not always been sufficiently considered in the past; we realise that it is impossible, to all intents and purposes, to guarantee the Canal against what might be termed &quot; a bolt-from-the-blue act of sabotage,&quot; that is to say, such an event as a ship in times of peace sinking itself in the fairway of the Canal. This kind of occurrence, however, is very unlikely to take place. But we do consider that a real danger of sabotage exists in times of strained relations with a foreign Power, and at such a time we consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have the power to (1.) Station military patrols as required along the banks of the Canal. (2.) Patrol the Canal with Naval and Air Forces.(3.) Station ships at Port Said and Suez to control the entrances to the Canal.We therefore are of opinion that when an agreement is made with the Egyptian Government, it should reserve to His Majesty&apos;s Government the right to take these steps whenever strained relations with another Power may occur, and, further, that the agreement should allow sufficient British Forces always to be stationed in Egypt to provide and protect these patrols as and when required. The Naval and Air Forces required could easily be provided at short notice when necessary. The Military Forces required, however, presuppose that the requisite troops, which we consider should be approximately of the strength of the normal garrison in Egypt, are available in the country, and it is a question as to where they should be located.The present Defence Schemes, which have been worked out by the different Commanders on the spot, have made arrangements to prevent acts of sabotage, and considerable attention has been paid locally to this question. The considered opinion of all military officers who have held the Egyptian Command is that all plots or organisations to overthrow or cause trouble to British interests in Egypt originate in Cairo, and it is there that bombs and mines can most easily be manufactured and conveyed to the Canal. It is accordingly one of the first considerations of the Military Defence Scheme to obtain early information of any plots, and thus to prevent bombs, mines or other explosives from leaving Cairo rather than to prevent the arrival of such things on the Canal. Arrangements of this kind obviously necessitate an effective military occupation of the immediate surroundings of Cairo; furtlier, the location of
troops in their present stations is eminently suited to allow all arrangements necessary being made to check acts of sabotage, as is proved by the Defence Scheme now existing. We accordingly consider that the actual location of troops in Cairo and its immediate vicinity is one of the best possible deterrents to the hatching of plots against the safety of the Canal and other British interests.On the other hand, if it should for political considerations be necessary to surrender our control of Cairo, we do not say that the defence of the Canal would be an impossibility; such forces as might then be available in Egypt would be utilised to afford such measure of protection to the Canal.as was possible pending the arrival of reinforcements from elsewhere. These reinforcements might have to reconquer a portion of the country, and this would entail a large expenditure of lives and money and would not guarantee the protection of the Canal against an act of sabotage in the interval while the incoming troops were establishing their position in the country.  We summarise our recommendations as follows : (1.) That in any agreement which is made with the Egyptian Government&apos; arrangements should be made whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government should have (a.) The power to place military patrols on the banks of the Canal and such Naval and Air Forces for patrolling the Canal or holding the entrances to the Canal as and when they think necessary.(6.) Sufficient forces in Egypt to provide and protect the forces mentioned above.(2.) That the Military and Air Forces required by (1) (b) above should be substantially the same, except for the temporary reinforcement of one Cavalry Regiment and one Infantry Battalion,* as the forces now in Egypt, and that they should hold Cairo and the immediate surroundings as at present.(3.) That, if for political reasons, it is considered necessary to give up the military occupation of Cairo and its immediate vicinity, then the safety of the Canal might still be provided for, but it would be a difficult and costly operation, entailing in all probability the despatch of an Expeditionary Force and the risk of sabotage to the Canal in the interval while the necessary military protection was being arranged.BEATTY. CAVAN.H. TRENCHARD.*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, January 27, 1925.* Note by the Chief of the Air Staff.I agree with the above report in considering that troops disposed as at present constitute the best defence of the Canal, yet in my opinion the same number of troops (ground, air and other services) could defend the Canal if stationed in its vicinity provided that a large sum of money were first expeuded in making the necessary stations.H. TRENCHARD.* Note. We wish to point out that although the situation in Egypt appears to be outwardly calm, we-do not consider that for the present any of the British Forces could be moved as reinforcements elsewhere, and we think that no weakening- of the Forces now in Egypt should be made until the High Commissioner is. satisfied that such a course of action is safe.
