These rates were examined in 1923 by the Anderson Committee on the Pay. etc. of State Servants.     The Committee found that the rates of pay at that time, were, having regard to the course of wages in industry, too high generally.     The rates of pay of Officers were subsequently considered by a Conference of Repre-sentatives of the three Service Departments and the Treasury, but in August 1924- agreement had not been reached.      Certain reductions were proposed by the three Departments but the War Office proposals were made conditional era the Admiralty and Air Ministry conceding similar proportionate reductions.     It is at this point that we have taken up the consideration of the pay of Officers, endeavouring to bring about an agreement between the Services.\
Anderson Committee and find ourselves in agreement with thefollowing conclusions reached by that Committee&quot;Our general conclusion is that Officers up to and including appointment to the rank of Captain in the Army and of Lieutenant-Commander in the Navy are at present being paid more that is necessary, or even perhaps quite fair to therest of the community&quot;...............&quot;Vie have examined the rates of pay and conditions of Service of Officers of middle rank in the Fighting Services and we find that the total emoluments provided under the Fisher scheme are not excessive, subject to such adjustment, on cost of living grounds, as is already provided for.&quot;The adjustments, amounting to on the pay provided for in 1919when the scales were introduced on the grounds of the cost ofliving, were put into force on July 1st, 1924.4. We have confined oxxvselves to the consideration of the rates of pay of the following ranks in the three Services(It will be noted that we have not included the rank of Lieutenant-Commander.)

We are inclined to agree with the Admiralty witness that on the whole it is fair to claim that a Junior Lieutenant in the Navy is a more responsible Officer than a Subaltern of some years1  standing in the Army but we consider that the difference in their ages is likely to entail added responsible-ilities in the case of the Army Officer.    It is for instance reasonable to assume that there are many more married Senior Lieutenants in the Army, say of the age of 28,  than there are married Junior Lieutenants in the Navy of the age oiL  say, 22. 6.     As regards the Air Force Officer we think that the element of risk attaching to the duties of a Flying Officer must
be taken seriously into account and that his &apos;scales of oay should be higher than those of Officers of approxi oately the same age in the other two Services.7.       We aro much I apressed by a statement made by the Admiralty witness that the cost of present day messing forthe naval Officer is about the same as it was in 1919.      -&apos;q consider that if this is tho case undue profits are being made by the food contractors to  the Navy and that the attention of the Admiralty should bo called to the matter. 8.       After weighing carefully all considerations we recommend that the pay of the Junior Officers of the throe Services should be:-Navy.Acting 3ub-Iieutenant 8/6 a day.Sub-Lieutenant 10/-   &quot;lieutenant 15/-   &quot;lieutenant after 4 years 17/&apos;-   &quot;lieutenant after 6 years 20/-   11Army.Second lieutenant 11/-   &quot;Lieutenant 13/-   &quot;Lieutenant after 7 years 16/-    &quot;Gaptain with le-ss than15 yrs. service    21/- &quot;Air Force.Pilot Officer 16/- &quot;Flying Officer 80/- &quot;Flying Officer after 2 years     23/- &quot;Flight Lieutenant 26/- &quot;Flight Lieutenant af&quot;cer 2years 28/-   &quot;These rates will be subject to  the same reductions forcost of living as the 1919 rates, that is, less 5%$ from thedate of their introduction which we recommend should beOctober 1st 19 25.
9.       ..ith these proposed new rates tho Admiralty saving, we are informed/ will ho  93,200 por annum in the normal,, Assuming that officers already commissioned when the new scales are introdtxoed are considered to have a vestod right to the present scales, tho full saving would he realized in from ten to eleven years8In the case of the war Office tho saving, we understand, will ho  330s000 por annum in tho normal, that is when all 2nd Lieutenants, Lieut enants,and Captains with less than fifteen years service are drawing the new rates.    On the same assumption as regards vestod rights it will ho fifteen years before the full saving takes effects The Air Ministry saving will ho  69,200 per annum in tho normal and the full saving will not tcko comeleto effect until about twenty years, though the bulk of the saving would materialise in about fifteen yearseSince it is only commissioned officers whom we regard as having vested rights, Cadets at Dartmouth, Sandhurst and Woolwich, and Oranwell would receive their commissions at the new rates and each batch as it enters and is  promoted will go to irndce up the savingo10o      wo have received from the War Office proposals for increases in engineer, corps and staff pay, totalling some  100,000 per annum, and for increases in lodging-allowance totalling  146,500 per annum (with a possi-bility of some  50,000 per annum for other allowances). The &quot;war Office pro ^proposals for reducing the pay of junior officers and their proposals for en^i^eer, corps and staff pay are.contingent on the increased allowances being sanctioned,,
We have not thought it part of&quot; our duty to examine those proposed increases.    Do doubt if we entered upon that  examination claims for increases would be received from the other two Services and it is for the Cabinet to censii er whether in the present state of the Country&apos;s finances any such proposals can be entertainedo11,      If the Cabinet accept these recommendations and aoprove our Report on Vested Rights, the new rates will only apply to new entrants into the three Services.SUMMARY OF REC OMMEH DATIOHS. (1)     The rates of pay of the following ranks of officers in the three Services should be:-NAVY.Acting Sub-Lieutenant .....      8/6 a day Sub-Lieutenant.............    10/&apos;-    &quot;Lieutenant ..... ...........  is/- &quot;Lieutenant after 4 years...    17/-Lieutenant after 6 years...    20/-    &quot;ARMY.Sec ond Lieutenant  ......... ll/- &quot;Lieutenant ............... 13/- &quot;Lieutenant after 7 years 16/- &quot;Captain with less than.....15 years service ..... 2l/- &quot;AIR FORCE.Pilot Officer............. 16/- &quot;Flying Officer  ..........;&apos; 20/&quot; &quot;Flying Officer after2 years........... 23/- &quot;Flight Lieutenant........... 26/- &quot;.Flight Lieutenant after2 years  ........... 28/- &quot;These new rates to come into force on October 1st but should not apply to officers already
