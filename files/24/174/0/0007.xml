While the Resolutions of Tynwald (the local Parliament) require confirmation by the Imperial Parliament, it wotild be unprecedent-dented for us to alter them.Resolutions in the Court of Tynwald have effect for six months from the date of the Resolutions, and if Parliament is then in session until the end of the then current session, but unless the Resolutions are confirmed by an Act, they cease to have statutory force at the end of that time. The Resolutions confirmed by this Bill were passed on the 9th June and 7th July.The effect of the Resolutions confirmed by this Bill is as follows:-Tobacco.    The Insular duties remain the same as the Imperial duties.Beer. The Insular import duty is increased to  3.14.0.These duties compare with an Excise duty of  3.15.0.(average) in this country.Spirits.    The Insular import duty on spirits remains at  3c7,6, a gallon as compared with  3.15-5. in this country (full rate), and the Excise Duty in this country of  3*12.6.

Artificial Silkf.,The same import duties are imposed in the Island as arc imposed in this country by the Finance Act this year, but no Excise duty is imposed as no silk or artificial silk is manufactured in the Island on which Excise Duty would be payable, YJinos^The Insular import duties on wines are increased so as to bring thorn up to the rates existing in this country, Toa^Coffee and Chicory^     These duties in the Isle of Han o.re permanent and do not require renewal.    Do changes arc made this year;  the duty on tea remains the same as in this country. Note on the &quot;Common Purse&quot; Arrangement,, In cases whore the Isle of Han Customs duties differ from those in force in the United Kingdom, the proceeds are   paid direct to the Insular Exchequer.
V/here the duties are the same, the &quot;Common irrangomont is in operation; the whole duty is paid into the Imperial Exchequer, and the Island is subsequently credited with the amount of duty payable on its estimated consumption of such articles, calculated by multiplying tho resident population plus an artificial &quot;fiscal equivalent&quot; for visitors by the average consumption per head in the United Kingdom.    The true &quot;fiscal population&quot; is ascertained at intervals of 10 years by obtaining returns of the actual imports to the Island of the articles in question, and dividing the total duty value ox such imports by the total duty value of tho consumption per head of similar articles in tho United Kingdom for the same year.      The &quot;fiscal equivalent&quot; for visitors in that year is then obtained by deducting the resident population from the ascertained &quot;fiscal population&quot; and is varied in subsequent years in proportion to the annual increase or decrease in the number of visitors.Treasury Chambers, 11th July, 1925.
