A&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;............&quot; tj- &apos;-jRUBBER RESTRICTIONS. Memorandum by the President of the Board.of Trade.As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum (CP.364 (25)) on the representations made by the American Ambassador as to the operation of the- restrictions on the exportation of rubber from the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements and Ceylon under the Stevenson scheme, I think it only right that my colleagues should be informed of the very strong representations which have been made to me by the British Rubber Manufacturers.    I accordingly append a copy of the latest letter on the subject which I have reoeived from the India Rubber Manufacturers * Association.    I believe that there is a real risk, amounting almost to a certainty, that British manufacturers will be forced to refuse contracts where they are not covered by forward purchases of rubber. This will add. to the volume of unemployment.    It has been argued that they can procure extra supplies by obtaining extra exports of rubber by paying the maximum rate of duty.   But no one will be prepared to do that, unless he is convinced that the price of rubber is to be maintained at a figure more than double that which the Stevenson scheme sought to attain. I am convinced,  therefore,  that the interests of the manufacturing industry require a much more rapid rate of release, and that the&apos;positive disadvantage to the industry ought to be careful&quot; weighed against any other countervailing advantages.(Intd.) P.C.-L. 27.7.25.Board of Trade.
APPENDIX,16, Deansgate,Manchester.25th July, 1925.air, Present price of Spot Rubber.pursuant to promise given at the interview I had with you yesterday I have pleasure in placing before you the following state-ment for submission by you to the President of the Board of Trade.1*     The present price for spot rubber is responsible for some 10 firms in this Association being in immediate danger of closing down on account oi their being compelled to buy on the spot market or being within three months of buying on the spot market.2,     The number of workpeople employed by these firms is several thousands (a conservative estimate being 4,000 operatives).3.     That these firms have not bought forward mainly for the reason that they relied upon the statement that the objective of the Stevenson scheme for the legislative restric-tion of Rubber Export from Malaya and Ceylon was the maintenance of price stability in rubber in the neighbourhood of l/3d (See marked portions of enclosed manifesto)4,     In addition to the operatives mentioned in Clause 2, it is certain that other firms must curtail production and so work short time to conserve   stocks of rubber in order to avoid buying forward at the present absurd forward prices.5.     The rubber market is definitely out of control.     At best the operation of the scheme, in its present form, can only release an additional two months supply of rubber per annum. The present deficiency in normal Fforld^s stock (8 months consumption according to the Stevenson Report Cmd 1678) is 4 months, hence the market will be definitely in short supply for two years, given that the maximum releases of 10% are operative quarter by quarter. (This is even assuming for the sake of argument that    the rate of consumption will remain the same as at present.)   There is every reason to believe that this will not be so e.g. the Stevenson Report (Cmd 1678) estimated that the consumption of rubber would be 300,000 tons in 1922 and the estimates of consumption for 1925 vary from 503,000 tons to 547,000 tons.*ThiS i3 a printed manifesto by the India Rubber Manufacturers1 Association, which I understand they have sent to all M.P&apos;s. Itreferato the then Colonial SecretaryTs speeoh at a dinner of the Incorporated Sooiety of Planters on the 18th July, 1924.(Intd.)     P.C-L.-1-THE INDIA RUBBER MANUFACTURERS&apos; ASSOCIATION LIMITED.Percy Ashley, Esq.,C.B., Board of Trade,Whitehall Gardens, London. S.W.I.
This estimate was wrong and could have been corrected had manufacturers been called into consultation.     In fact the estimate was corrected in the Stevenson Supplementary Report Cmd 1756 Sec 2 but nevertheless the existing legislation was enacted on the figure of 300,000 tons.     At the present moment -and for some time past - the colonial Office apparently has, and is relying upon figures from unofficial sources, the reliability of which is open to grave suspicion. .The demand of the manufacturers is that there should be super-imposed on the existing scheme arrangements which would provide for quick releases if the price soared over l/9d. and on the other hand manufacturers would be prepared as a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; to consent to quick withdrawals If the price sank below a certain level.No alteration of the scheme is necessary if this request is acceded to.     Such provisions would come into operation only, if and when the prices soared or slumped.(N.B. I have suggested to the Secretary of the Colonial Office Rubber Advisory Committee, in sufficient detail, the method of oarrying out the suggestion adumbrated above).If the Stevenson Scheme be not amended so as to ensure stability of price between l/3d and l/6d, then immediate international oo-operation by Manufacturers in the direction of organised &quot;Short Time&quot; working would appear to be the only way of saving Rubber Manufacturing firms from extinction.     The point is, Rubber - given the unamended operation of the Stevenson scheme -is likely to be in short supply for years.     The market is likely to be therefore highly speculative.     The buying public of Rubber Manufactures is going to be likewise speculative, and the gravest consequences are likely to ensue.     There must inevitably be a recurrence of these crises of which the dire consequences of the present one as given in clause 1, may be averted given prompt action.(N.B. I would recall here the testimony of the managingDireotor of the firm represented at our Interview on Thursday, the 23rd inst., and to state that his position unfortunately is not an isolated one).I shall be pleased to supply any further information, or to wait upon you at any time in order to avert the disastrous consequenoes any delay in dealing with the situation would inevitably entail.I am,Yours faithfully,(Sgd) John Haworth,
