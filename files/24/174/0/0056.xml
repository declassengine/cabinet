i [HIDENT!At- LIBRARY^[fphis Document is .the Property of His Britannic .Majesty&apos;s Government.]-^  / Printed for the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIAL.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.][W 6843/9/98]DISARMAMENT.I HAVE given careful thought to the paper on Disarmament by Lord Cecil circulated to the Cabinet under number CP. 329 (25). With Lord Cecil&apos;s object I am in full sympathy, nor will anyone dispute the force of the argument which tie derives from the language of the Covenant and the communication made by the Allies to the German negotiators. But I find myself very much opposed to the instruction which he recommends should be given to the British delegates to the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League.Lord Cecil suggests that the British delegates should propose that the recently formed Co-ordination Committee or seme similar body should enquire into and report upon the principles of international disarmament by land and air. Incidentally I may observe that I do not think that the Co-ordination Committee is in any case a suitable body for this purpose and that for the British Government to propose such a step in regard to land and air forces, whilst omitting all reference to the sea, would, as I think Lord Cecil himself sees, provoke very invidious comment. But these are minor difficulties for which a solution could be found. My objection to the proposal goes deeper.From the date of the First Assembly down to the present time the question of disarmament has occupied a prominent, perhaps the most prominent, place in the discussions of the Assembly. It is not through apathy or from lack of effort that the problem remains unsolved, but because the basic conditions required for disarmament have not yet been attained. At an early stage the conclusion was reached that security was the first step on the road to reduction and our efforts were concentrated on providing security first by Lord Cecil&apos;s Treaty of Mutual Assistance and then by the protocol. The avowed object of both was to pave the way to a reduction.There can be no reduction without security. This proposition is incontestable, and, in putting forward the suggestion made in his present memorandum, Lord Cecil is proceeding on the assumption that the Western Pact provides the security for which Europe is asking, and that the time has arrived to consider the next step forward. But is this assumption justified ? In the first place the new pact is not yet concluded,, and the news from Germany shows that her attitude towards it is still very uncertain. Secondly, as Lord Cecil himself most cogently points out, the new pact does not touch Russia, and Russia is the key to the problem, at least as far as Eastern Europe is concerned. Is it the slightest use to propose reduction of armaments to the Powers of Eastern Europe while they remain under the nightmare of Bolshevik Russia ? and,, even if the latter were to come in to any scheme for reduction, who can trust or be expected to trust a Russian promise or signature in the light of what is happening about propaganda ?The attitude of France, it must be observed, has been consistent throughout. Her refusal to disarm is not a result of military fever but of deep-rooted fear, arising from past history, in regard to her future safety. All French Governments and all French parties -indeed, it may be said, the whole French people have consistently stated the path of progress in the sequence: security, arbitration, disarmament. If the mutual pact and its accompanying treaties are successfully negotiated and ratified by the respective Governments, French security and the triumph of arbitration will have been achieved, and, as far as the Western Powers are concerned, disarmament will have been rendered possible and the pressure of economic events will, I think, force a. great reduction upon a not unwilling France. This, I believe, would be the case even though the Russian danger remained menacing and prevented comparable reductions among the Eastern Powers, but I hope that the Cabinet will remember Lord Balfour&apos;s T13354]
Foreign Office, July 16, 1925.warning that, as long as Russia maintains such large forces, it may not be to our interest that the continental Powers should carry disarmament as far as we ourselves have done.Be this as it may, however, I am strongly opposed to the British delegates taking any initiative in this matter at the forthcoming conference. Lord CeciTs memorandum arose out of the Cabinet discussion on the draft which I submitted of a personal letter to M. Briand deprecating any Franco-British initiative at this same conference in reopening the protocol discussions. Lord Cecil, it will be remembered, took a slightly different view from the rest of the Cabinet, and in deference to his suggestion I introduced into my letter a paragraph on disarmament. I have now received, and circulate with this memorandum, M. Briand&apos;s reply. It is very much what I expected. M. Briand maintains the traditional policy that disarmament can only follow upon the achievement of security. He not&apos; obscurely indicates that, if the British Government are going to press forward or to support an immediate policy of disarmament in advance of the settlement of the security question, the French Government must counter this British initiative by themselves reopening the question of the protocol. M. Briand admits the inconveniences and even the dangers of this course, and, not without a certain humorous appreciation of the situation, he intimates that, if Great Britain is going to pillory France as the obstacle to disarmament, France will be obliged to point out that Great Britain and the British Empire have been the principal influence at work to defeat all attempts at progress in the question of security. Does anyone suppose that the British delegation and the British Empire will come well out of a discussion conducted on these lines in the atmosphere of the Assembly, where France is always certain of a majority in favour of enlisting the whole strength of the British Empire in defence of any country which is menaced by aggression ?Twice has the Assembly discussed at length this allied question of security and disarmament. Twice has the Assembly elaborated an agreement, and both times largely on a British initiative, given first by Lord Cecil himself and last year by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. Each time the agreement achieved at Geneva has been rejected by the Government at home. Lord GeciFs scheme for a treaty of mutual, assistance was destroyed by Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. The protocol was destroyed by the present Government. To take the initiative a third time without the certainty of success would be, in my opinion, disastrous to the influence of Great Britain, and scarcely less disastrous to the influence of the League. Every unsuccessful attempt to amend the Covenant casts doubt upon the validity and efficacy of the Covenant as it stands. Every conspicuous failure of the League, such as these failures to secure the adoption of the agreements reached at Geneva, brings the League into deconsideration if not into contempt. I trust, therefore, that my colleagues will authorise me to reply to M. Briand that we recognise the force of his argument that the question of security must be settled before the Assembly can fruitfully begin the discussion of a general limitation of land armaments, and that we are prepared to support the French delegation in endeavouring to secure the postponement of action on this matter till the fate of the proposed Pact of Mutual&apos;Guarantee is determined,I had understood Lord Cecil to make a rather different proposal in Cabinet, and it is one which I think the Cabinet might usefully adopt,. Sooner or later we shall have to face this question of disarmament&apos;, and it would be well that we should prepare ourselves for such a discussion by au examination of what is practical If such an examination is not undertaken, it may well be that we shall be confronted at some future Assembly with a definite scheme presented by some other Power which we cannot accept, and to which we are not in a position to offer any alternative. I had understood that it was against this danger that Lord Cecil desired to guard, and that the decision which he sought from the Cabinet was that our technical advisers should he instructed to study the&quot;problem, and to submit to the Cabinet the best scheme of general disarmament that they can devise, or at least of the principles upon which any such scheme should be framed. Such a proposal I should heartily support, for it would give us the basis upon which, after adequate examination and discussion in the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet, we could prepare ourselves for a discussion in which, sooner or later, we&apos;shall have to take part.
9 0 4 0-3 1[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government/)CONFIDENTIAL.[W 6867/9/98]M. Briand to Mr. Austen Chamberlain.(Translation.)Dear Mr. Chamberlain, Paris, July 13, 1925.1 OWE you my apologies for not having answered your letter of the 2nd July before.   The stress of parliamentary work is the only reason for the delay.Even now I am not in a position to set forth fully my views on the agenda of the forthcoming Assembly of the League of Nations. You will readily understand that I must first obtain the concurrence of my colleagues on the subject and consult the French delegates to Geneva. I will not, however, wait any longer before giving you my first impressions of your letter. I will give them with the same frankness which you have shown in informing- me of your views, as I share your conviction that by conducting onr discussions with mutual confidence we shall do more than by any other means&apos; to promote that agreement which is so essential to us both.The reasons for which you consider it undesirable to allow the next Assembly of the League of Nations to engage this year in further discussions on questions relating to the Covenant or the Protocol are not without great weight. I recognise that it is unlikely that such discussions will be fruitful so long as our negotiations with Germany are not completed. Even if these negotiations have reached the happy consummation which we both desire before the month of September, it may be undesirable, for the reasons which you set forth so clearly, to allow further discussion of the Covenant to take pla^e at Geneva. I cannot help doubting, however, whether it will be possible to achieve the end you have in view and for us to succeed in preventing the Assembly from expressing an opinion on questions which are of particular interest to the majority of European States.I am all the more doubtful for the reason that, whether we wish it or not, the problem has already actually been referred to the Assembly. You will certainly remember that on the 13th March last the Council decided to refer to the Sixth Assembly the statements on the Protocol made by you and myself and the other members of the Council, and that the Assembly is called upon to express its view on the subject. A discussion is thus inevitable. This is yet a further reason why we should come to an agreement between now and the month of September on the attitude which the British and French delegations are to adopt.It was therefore not without a certain misgiving that I read the sentence in your letter in which you assure me that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would warmly welcome at this Assembly any practical advance towards the limitation of armaments.&quot;You are aware that certain delegations at Geneva have always shown a tendency to treat the question of armaments independently. This is a doctrine which the French delegation, for their part, have always resisted, and they have been happj- to find themselves in agreement with the British delegation, both last year and in previous years, in maintaining another principle namely, that the question of the reduction of armaments cannot usefully be dealt with until a satisfactory solution has been found to the problem of security, which, iu turn, cannot be separated from the question of arbitration.Consequently if our two Governments agree upon joint action in September next to prevent the Assembly from discussing the question of amendments to the Covenant, we must at the same time agree as to the attitude which we should adopt should another delegation desire nevertheless to raise the question of disarmament. I may say at once that the French Government, for their part, adhere, to the doctrine which they have held hitherto, and that they cannot dissociate the question of disarmament from that of arbitration and security.Such are the first thoughts inspired by your letter. I reserve the liberty to develop them and to submit to you a programme of joint action when I have had the time to discuss the question with M. Paid-Boncour. In this connection I may say that I shall be pleased at any time to examine suggestions which you may be good enough to put forward. V^o-ta-v^ ^V^^/miXo(7    LhaTeir&amp;e. .
