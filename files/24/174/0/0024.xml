rt   . CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,[BEjS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&amp; QOVICTEEfflT 3.?CRET. Copy Ito. % &amp;,p, 525 (25)* cabinet,DEVELOPMENT OF THE BEST SUGAR IMDOBTHT.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister of Labour.1,      We desire to draw the attentiozi of the Cabinet to certain proposals for accelerating the development of the Beet Sugar Industry in this country which have been put forward by Lord Weir in a letter, a copy of which is attached, to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.2,       The value of the Beet Sugar industry, both to Agriculture, as a development of latent productive power in the country and as a means of relieving unemployment, has been amply demonstrated, and needs no further emphasis.3.       As a result of the British Sugar (Subsidy) Act a very considerable impetus has been given to the development of the industry, and it is certain that seven new factories will be in operation in the coming autumn season.     There is reason to believe, however, that this expansion has exhausted for the present the capital resources that oan be obtained by private enterprise for the development of the industry.       It seems dear, therefore, that development is likely to be arrested.4.       Any such retardation of the rate of development of the industry would be most unfortunate.     It is important that factories should begin operations in the earlier part of the ten-year subsidy period, so that they may have the advantage of the higher rate of subsidy while they are gaining experience.     Moreover, such assistance as the building of new factories can afford towards relieving unemployment in Engineering and other industries i3 needed now. There is ample room for further expansion in new areas that have not yet been touched.
5.      Lord Weir&apos;8 proposal is in effect that the Govermaent should provide the capital necessary for the erection of six sugar factories in time for the season of 1926 and thai these factories should be built, equipped and operated by the Anglo-Scottish Beet sugar Corporation as agents for the Government. Lord Weir is prepared to do this work on behalf of the Government on whatever terms are considered fair and reasonable.6,     The suggestion that the scheme should be operated through the agenoy of the Anglo-Scottish Corporation is, we consider, not unreasonable.     There are only tivo financial groups luith sufficient experience and resources to enable them to staff and operate six new factories in the 1926 season. These are the Anglo-Scottish Corporation and the Dutch (van Rossujs) group, whose technical staff is almost entirely foreign. If   any Bcherae of the nature suggested by Lord Weir is approved it should certainly, in our opinion, be operated so as to secure the maximum employment of British staff.?.     We consider that Lord Weir* a proposals are deserving of very careful examination, and with this object we suggest that they should be referred for exhaustive enquiry to a special !ad hoc&apos; Committee of the Committee of Civil Research.IS *F .

(Copy.) - Holm Foundry,Catheart, Glasgow.29th June, 1-325.Dear Mr. Wood,As you know, 1 have given a great deal of attention to the unemployment situation in this country, and recently I have investigated the possibilities and useful reactions which would accrue froin a much more rapid development of British beet sugar.     I feel that these notes may be of some value to your-self and your colleague, the Minister of Labour.Less than two years ago I came to the conclusion that British beet sugar could be developed into a useful British industry, and, as you are aware, I decided to play a part in the development.    The first factory of the Anglo-Scottish Corporation carried through Its first campaign last winter.    I have carefully analysed the agriculture and factory figure for this campaign and found, them to be of a highly encouraging nature.    In my view the industry can be put on an economic basis within the nine years of the subsidy.In pursuing this investigation I have been led to con-sider the present position of British agriculture - a matter which-I assume occupies your constant attention.    Although my study has been a comparatively superficial one, it leads me to the broad conclusion that sugar beet may be the foundation of a new prosperity for British agriculture.    For some time British Governments have been looking for an agricultural policy, and I. go so far as to suggest that sugar beet may be the basis of a definite agricultural policy.    As you know, certain reputable investigators have reported that modern German agricultural prosperity is founded on the lessons and practice gained in grow-ing beet and the favourable incidence on cereal crops and. the feeding of live stock, due to beet becoming the rotational  i*oot crop.&quot;f&apos;ii.f&quot; i&quot;&apos; 1 &apos;:: fr&apos;i i f i.
A few weeks ago I had the privilege of a long conversation with J4r. i rith ntabbethge, the most distinguished and influential sugar and agricultural authority possibly in the world.       Incidentally he was the creator of the Tentenmark which saved Germany.   His definite opinion .is that sugar best oould change our entire agricultural future, and coming from such a high authority this statement carries enough weight to warrant the fullest investigation.In the meantime sufficient evidence has been definitely gained to show that, as a 3ugar proposition viewed by itself, the growing of British beet is sound and healthy. The existing development under the subsidy Is healthy, but only moderately progressive.   Much more rapid development is warranted, but I feel that this acceleration will not be secured by private enterprise alone,  as the capital will not be forth-coming until the industry is established and can shew sub-stantial profits.    Thi3 view ia supported by the comparative failure of the two recent sugar issues.The present time has unique characteristics in regard to rapid development, because all sugar produced at home reduces Our food bill to the foreigner, and sugar production gives an enormous amount of employment.    Sugar is one of the enormous import fields suitable for substantial home production. In many of our export trades we are losing our markets,  and we mu3t create sub3titutional employment.Over 95;! of the machinery and plant can be manufactured in this country, as we have shown in our factories.    The cost of a factory is approximately  250,000, of which 75% represents wages.   Six factories put under construction now would give employraent to 7,500 men for twelve months.    The work can be spread over establishments in Scotland and England.-   - Assuming the1 average unemployment benefit and PoorLaw at.25/- per week,7,500 men for a year are costing the country
 4-87,500, or  91,250 per factory     Oil tho ;cultivation of tha beet employment-will be given to 6,000 men for 30 weeks in the year, while the factories would employ other 3,000 men for twelve to fourteen weeks.   All sorts of other employment would be given in the supply of coal, limestone and on the railways.The two essential things to remember are that this employment would be all new and additional employment, while the product would represent an asset constituting a permanent productive industry, producing something in this country which had formerly bean paid for to the foreigners.   It is essential to create such new industries as will reduce our Imports and balance the losses we are now sustaining.Under tha Beet Sugar Subsidy Act large profits * should accrue to the factory owners.In view of all these foregoing considerations.I would like to discuss with you and the Minister of Labour a proposal on the following lines.   The Anglo-Scottish Beet Sugar Corporation is the only company in the industry rhich is not substantially financed and operated by foreign interest -Ith the result that the biggest percentage of the profits goes abroad.   On the other hand, the Anglo-Scottish Corporation have already shewn their ability and capacity. &quot;   -. With all these factors in view, I suggest that the Government should ask the Anglo-Scottish Corporation to select sites and areas, design, build and equip six sugar factories to be ready  for the season for 1986 for the Minister of Agriculture, and to operate these factories on a private enterprise basis on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, and to accept as remuneration for this a minimum fee and an agreed percentage of the net profit.    I have no hestitation in affirming that, between the savings on Unemployment Insurance and the profit on the operation of the factories, coupled with the reaction on reduced Imports, the whole transaction would be a thoroughly
sound economic one, and present a constructive and creative British production scheme worthy of the support of yourssif and Sir Arthur Ste el-Rial t land.I send you this letter unofficially in the meantime, and rill be glad if you Fill arrange to discuss It v/ith me along v.rith the Minister of Labour.I am,Yours truly,(Sgd.) 1S3IR.The Right Hon. Edward. F.L. &quot;food, M.P., Minister of Agriculture,. white hall Place,London, S.YM.,
