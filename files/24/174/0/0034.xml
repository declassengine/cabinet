IE OS RIM REPORT,,The first part of the Committees Terms of Reference, on the question of Marriage   Allowances for Ifeval Off! cers, has been disposed of by an Interim Report (Cabinet Paper CP. 259 (25)) which was approved by the Cabinet at their meeting held on May 28th (Cabinet 27 (25) 7).2. - The Committee have considered the pay of Men - hewEntrants, but owing to the difficulties they have met in endeavouring to settle  reductions acceptable to the three -Service Departments,  desire to present an Interim Report setting forth proposals for the approval- of the Cabinet. These proposals are,  the Committee consider, the only practicable way of overcoming the difficulties.3. The present rates of pay date from 1919.      Thenaval rates-were fixed first,  on the basis of the recommend-ations of  vdmiral Jen-am&quot;s Committee.      The Army and   iir Force rates were determined subsequently by a Cabinet Committee under Mr. E.A.I. Fisher.      The Anderson Committee on the Pay of State Servants examined the rates in 1923 andi Jjr. (25]..
found them to be too high, having regard to the course of wages in industry. The Committee recommended as a basis for revision a scheme submitted to them by the   irmy council which if adopted would have led eventually to a reductionof 4:0% in the total pay roll for men in the Army.      Underthis scheme the pay of the private on entry was  to bereduced  from 2/9 a day to 1/6 a day.On further examination of the problem - in 1924 underthe late Government it was considered that reductions onthis scale were impracticable ,      Agreement was reached between  the  admiralty, War Office and Treasury that the starting rate of pay for the ordinary seaman and the privatesoldier should be 2/- a day, a reduction of 9d, per day onthe present rate of 2/9 par day.      The Army Council schemeof reduction was recast to conform with this new starting point, and as revised would produce an eventual reductionof 20f0 in the total p-ay roll.      The proposals submitted tothe present Committee by the Army Council are on this basis,conditional however on corresponding reductions being madein the pay of the other 3ervi ceo,      The actual figures forthe combatant arms are as follows:-	Pre;	sent	Rate.	Proposed Rate.		Private on enlistment	2/9	per	diem	2/-	per	diemPrivate after two years	3/6	per	diem	s/-	per-	di emPrivate after three years	3/6	per	diem	2/6	per	diemLance Corporal	4/,,	pa r	diem	3/3	per	diemCorporal	5/-	per	diem	4/-	per	d iemLance Sergeant	5/6	P er	diem	4/9	per	d i em   -Sergeant	fh	per	diem	6/-	per	diemCompany Ouertermaster :Sergeant	9/6	per	di em	8/-	per	diemCompany Sergeant Major	10/-	per	di em.	8/6	per	diemRegimental &quot;Quartermaster Sergeant	12/-	pe r	diem	10/-	per	di emRegimental Sergeant Major (&quot;&quot;/arrant Officer Class I)	14/-	per	diem	12/-	per	diem
The proposals submitted to the Committee by the Admiralty and .iir Ministry do not give so big a reduction.      The Admiralty offer practically amounts to a flat rate reduction of 9d. a day on all rates of pay, irrespective of amount.The Air Ministry offer no reduction in the pay of their highly skilled technical men.      For men in certain less skilled trades and for non-technical aircraftsmen they offer reductions on a lower scale than the War Office.      Only for medical personnel are they willing to fall completely into line with -the Army.is between the Navy and  i.rmy the principal difference is in the treatment of the higher ranks.      The War Office state that they cannot make reductions of from l/- to 2/- a day if the - admiralty reduce similar rates of pay by only 9d. a day. As between the Army and Air Force the difference is more one of principle.    The War Office scheme is based on the pay necessary for the combatant soldiers who form the great. majority of the Army.      This decided, the skilled tradesmen have been dealt with substantially on the same lines, notwithstanding&apos; the special difficulties experienced in recruiting these men. This equality of treatment is necessary for domestic military reasons.      In the Royal ..iir Force on the other hand the technical aircraftsmen predominate and the Air Gouncil could not agree to subordinate the special requirements of this class to those of non-technical men or of ordinary soldiers in the Army.&apos;4. The final proposals,  that is to say, the limit of reduction in the pay of men to which the three Departments willingly are prepared to go are;-
Strength.Pay PollRedactionPeroentage94,000 10,163,00012V/ar Office141,500 10,900,000 2,250,00020\ i tMinis try28,000 2,500,000 172^0007The Committee do not consider that the reductions offered by the Admiralty and Air Ministry are sufficient.The Committee have heard representatives of the three Departments and have given careful consideration to fa eir detailed proposals, but in pressing the Admiralty and Air Ministry for further reductions on the pay of certain ratings in these two Services they have realised that it is quite impossible to impose on the Departments a detailed revision of the rates of pay which would be satisfactory either to the Services or to the Cabinet.It is not considered necessary to set forth at length in this Report the innumerable difficulties experienced in endeavouring to compare,  for fixing rates of pay, the many different ranks and grades in the three Services.      The Committee have listened at great length to arguments of the Admiralty and Air Ministry that there are special features attached to sailors and airmen which claim for them a non-proportionate reduction of pay to that of- soldiers.      These arguments are based on a variety of reasons,  but mainly on superior skill and type of man required.5. The Committee therefore oropose to indicate-to each department what total reduction on its Men&quot;s pay roll must be made, leaving the Departments to decide how the reductions should be effected.&apos;At the same time the Committee consider that the  rates, of pay for the lowest grades of entrance Into the three Services should be as similar as possible,  since any marked
disparity in this respect is bound to have a prejudicial effect on the recruiting into any particular Service.    -The Committee would impress this consideration on the Departments in calling for their schemes of reduction.We believe that a reduction of between 15 and 16$ for the Navy would be roughly equivalent to a reduction of 20$ for the Army.      This view was accepted by the chief witness from the War Office.With regard to the  Air Force there are special circum-stances which do not apply to the other two, and we have been convinced that to ash for a greater reduction than 10$ would imperil the  efficiency of that Force.6, We accordingly recommend that the reduction to becalled for should be approximately:-Admiralty 15$ *War Office 20$Air Ministry       10$ On present numbers these percentages should lead eventually to a saving of -Navy el, 524,000 a yeararmy  2,250,000 a yeariir Force  250,000 a year or a total of  4,024,000.7. The Cabinet will realise that these, savings will notaccrue immediately, owing to the existence of vested rights, but the Committee have not yet complete! their examination of that question -and will deal with it in a later report.U dd-.,V.V-  5; - ilf; i ,      / l    &apos;   i   : ^    &apos; .        &apos;d.* On present basis of recruitment,  i.e. not taking into account savings which may bo expected by the introduction of a short service system.

The Committee accordingly ask for the approval ofthe Cabinet to their requesting the three Service Departments to submit Tables of pay worked out in detail showing how they would make the reductions set forth above.They believe that with good will the Departments will be able to recast their rates of pay so as to produce these savings without giving rise to any serious anomalies as between the three Services.      The Committee will of course survey generally the new rates in order to satisfy themselves that a reasonable measure of consistency is secured.Signed on behalf of the Committee JOHx, GILii-OUA.CHAliM&amp;E.2, Whitehall Gardens,  3.W.I. 9th July, 1925.
