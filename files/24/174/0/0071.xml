REPORTTo the Eight Honourable the Minister of Labour. Sir,Preliminary.1. By virtue of an Appointment dated 13th of July, 1925, made by you under the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, we were constituted a. Court of Inquiry with the following terms of reference : &quot; To inquire into the causes and circumstances of the dispute in the coal mining industry and to report thereon.&quot;In fulfilment of this instruction we have now the honour to submit the following Report :  2. We held a preliminary meeting in private on 16th July, 1925, to determine questions of procedure, and on 17th July we opened our Inquiry in pub he at the Institution of Civil Engineers, Great George Street, Westminster, where accommodation had been placed at our disposal. Intimation of the setting up of the Court and of the place and date of the first sitting had previously been made by you to the Mining Association of Great Britain and to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain, and an invitation extended to them to be present. Representatives of the Mining Association were in attendance at the opening of the Court, but the Miners&apos; Federation were not represented. A letter to you from the Secretary of the Miners&apos; Federation, dated 15th of July,, and received by you on the 17th of July, was placed in our hands and read by the Chairman at the commencement of the proceed-ings, in which it was stated that in view of the previous investiga-tions and conclusions of the Royal Commission -of 1919 and the Court of Inquiry of 1924, the Miners&apos; Federation felt that no good purpose would be served by yet another Inquiry and that the Miners&apos; Federation could &quot; take no part in proceedings which, from the terms of reference and the constitution of the Court are so obviously designed to justify the present attack upon the mine-workers&apos; standard of living and in respect of which it was in no way consulted.&apos;&apos; The letter concluded by stating that the Miners&apos; Federation were &quot; perfectly willing to meet the Mine Owners again in open conference if and when the.present proposals are withdrawn.&quot;3. The Chairman pointed out that the Miners&apos; Federation had apparently misconceived the function of the Court and we decided to adjourn our proceedings to 20th of July in order that, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, a formal request might be directed to Mr. Herbert Smith and Mr. A. J. Cook, theJ President and the Secretary respectively of the Miners&apos; Federation, and any other representatives whom they might appoint to attend before us on that date. A reply was subse-quently received from both Mr. Smith and Mr. Cook declining to attend.
i. We regarded ourselves as in no way absolved from the duty which you had imposed upon us by the non-attendance of any interested parties, and on 20th of July we accordingly entered upon our Inquiry in the absence of representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation.Position as between the Mining Association and the Miners&apos; Federation.5. We invited the Mine Owners to inform us in the first place -of the existing position as between themselves and the Miners&apos; Federation, in view of the discussions which we understood had taken place. Mr. Evan Williams, the President of the Mining Association, accordingly narrated the course of events leading up to the present dispute. It appears that in November, 1924, the Mining Association, in view of the grave state of the industry, proposed to the Miners&apos; Federation that a small Joint Committee consisting of members of each body should be set up to make a thorough investigation of the condi-tions of the industry in all its aspects. After preliminary dis-cussions, which occasioned some delay, the Miners&apos; Federation in March, 1925, agreed to this course, and the Joint Committee was duly constituted (described as a Joint Sub-Committee). Meantime on 20th of February, the Mining Association had sub-rnitted a Programme of the proposed Investigation and the Miners&apos; Federation had submitted a series of Propositions. These are printed in the Appendix to our Report (Nos. I and II), and are referred to for their terms The procedure proposed was that the Joint Committee should deal with the subject matter of their inquiry in three stages devoted respec-tively to (1) the facts, (2) the causes, and! (3) the remedies.6. The Joint Committee accordingly addressed itself first- to the ascertainment of the facts, and after a series of eight meetings between 18th of March and 14th of May drew up a statement embodying the results of their investigations to date. At subse-quent meetings held on 11th, 12th, 17th, 18th, and 23rd of June, the Joint Committee proceeded to the second stage, namely, the consideration of the causes of the very grave state of affairs which had been revealed. As the discussion of this topic proceeded it merged into the third stage, namely, the consideration of remedies and in the event, neither the second nor the third stage was ever completed. The representatives of the Mining Association expressed the view that the main cause of the depressed condition of the industry lay in the high cost of the production of coal in this country which restricted the demand both at home, and, more strikingly, in competitive markets abroad. This high cost the Mining Association attributed in large measure to the reduction of the working day from eight hours to seven hours under the Coal Mines Act of 1919, and they urged that if Parliament were to sanction a reversion to the eight hours&apos; day, the cost of production would be so reduced as to enable employment to be increased consequent upon increased
sales, and better terms could be offered to the workers on any revision of the existing Wages Agreement of 18th of June, 1924 than could be offered if the hours of labour were to. remain as at present. The Mining Association also attributed the prevailing depression to the operation of the existing Wages Agreement and stated that the industry could not continue to carry on under that: Agreement&apos;. If there were to be no extension of working hours they represented that the Agreement would require to be revised much less favourably to the workers than if the hours were extended. The representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation on the Joint Committee indicated that they were entirely opposed&apos; to any extension of the existing hours of labour and to any. revision of the Wages Agreement which would give the workers less than their 1914 wages plus an addition correspond-ing to the increased cost of living. While certain of the topics raised in the Propositions of the Miners&apos; Federation were inci-dentally. discussed the parties never reached the stage of a full investigation of these Propositions owing to the developments consequent upon the submission of the Mine Owners&apos; views as to the appropriate remedies for the existing situation. ., 7. As it appeared that there was no prospect of the representa-tives of the Miners&apos; Federation agreeing to the proposals of the Mining Association for an extension of the hours of work or a revisal of the existing Agreement in a direction less favourable to the miners, the Joint Committee separated on 23rd of June and has not since met. At the conclusion of this last meeting the position was thus concisely expressed by Mr. Herbert Smith : &quot; We are going away now with a clear issue, that you have decided that at the first opportunity, which is the 30th of June you will give notice to terminate the Agreement . . . It is up to you to send us word in writing definitely that you intend giving us notice and also to send us your proposals for a further meeting . . . Last time we gave you notice and we had to take the initiative.&quot; It should be explained that the twelfth Article of the Wages Agreement of 18th of June, 1924, provides that its period should be to 30th of June, 1925, and thereafter until terminated by one month&apos;s notice on either side. - 8. On 30th of June accordingly the Mining Association. gave formal notice to the Miners&apos; Federation terminating the existing Wages Agreement at 31st of July, and on 1st of July the Mining Association transmitted their proposals for a new Wages Agree-ment. These proposals are printed in the Appendix hereto (No. III). It will be observed that they make no reference to an extension of the hours of working. On 3rd of July a Conference of the Miners&apos; Federation was held to consider these proposals and on the same day they addressed a letter to the Mining Asso-ciation intimating their unanimous decision that the proposals could not be accepted, the reasons given being :-&quot; (1) The removal of the guaranteed minimum wages, which :are already below the level of the present cost of living.
(2) The provision of guaranteed profits to the colliery owners, irrespective of the rate of wages.(3) The immediate great reduction in wages varying from 13T4 per cent, to 47&apos;91 per cent, on basis rates.(4) The continued separation of the mining operations from profitable undertakings in connection with the coking and by-product departments, etc.&quot; The letter concluded by a repetition of &quot; our demand that the mine workers are entitled to a wage rate not less than is neces-sary to meet the increase in the cost of living.&quot;9. Thereafter, on 7th of July the Chairman of the Mining Asso-ciation proposed a meeting for an interchange of views, but the Miners&apos; Federation replied that a meeting on the proposals sub-mitted would not serve any good purpose as their Conference had already indicated that there was no room for negotiations in those proposals. Mr. Bridgeman, First Lord of the Admiralty, together with the Minister of Labour and the Secretary for Mines, there-upon interviewed representatives of each party. The outcome was that the Miners&apos; Federation expressed their willingness to meet the Mining Association in conference as soon as the latter had &quot; withdrawn &quot; their proposals. The Mining Association, on the other hand, while maintaining the attitude that they had not abandoned their proposals, which still represented their views, exj)expressed their readiness to meet the Miners&apos; Federation and to discuss any proposals which they might wish to make for a new Agreement.10. Thus the position of the parties when we held our meeting on 20th of July was that the Mining Association had, in conformity with the understanding of parties, submitted their proposals for a new Wages Agreement to replace the existing Agreement on its termination; that the Miners&apos; Federation did not see their way tc accept these proposals for the reasons assigned ; that no alterna-tive projwsals for the revisal of the existing Agreement had been submitted by the Miners&apos; Federation who had confined them-selves to a reiteration of the miners&apos; right to a wage rate not less than sufficient to meet the increase in the cost of living ; and that the only impediment in the way of a further meeting between the parties lay in the requirement by the Miners&apos; Federation that the Mining Association should &quot; withdraw &quot; their proposals and the refusal of the Mining Association to accede in terms to this requirement. Any previous stipulation that the notice of termina-tion of the Wages Agreement should be withdrawn had thus dis-appeared as a feature of the situation at the time of our meeting.11. In view of the eminent desirability of a resumption of discussion and negotiation between the parties we felt it to be our duty at an early stage of our proceedings to endeavour to remove the impediment above alluded to. It occurred to us that the parties might be at cross purposes as regards the requirement of the withdrawal of the Mining Association^ proposals. It was obvious that the Mining Association could not be asked5890* - a3
to abandon views which they entertained any more than the Miners&apos; Federation could be asked to abandon views which thev entertained. We ascertained from Mr. Williams that the posf-tion of his Association was that they were prepared to meet the Mi ners&apos; Federation in open conference, taking up the discus-sion where the parties had left it at the last meeting of the Joint Committee on 23rd of June, before the proposals of the Mining Association were formulated and transmitted, and that the Mining Association would without prejudice consent to hold their proposals in abeyance until any proposals which the Miners&apos; Federation might put forward should first be discussed. If, however, the stipulation of the Miners&apos; Federation meant that no remedies which involved any reduction in wages ov lengthening of hours could even be referred to in the course of an open discussion the Mining Association could not see their way to entering upon a- conference on such terms.12. Recognising that the obstacle in the way of a conference between the parties might possibly lie in divergent views as to the meaning of the requirement that the Mining Association should &quot; withdraw &quot; their proposals, the Mining Association addressed a letter to the Miners&apos; Federation proposing a meeting to discuss the matter, but the Miners&apos; Federation, in their reply, merely repeated their stipulation that the Mining Association should &quot; withdraw &quot; their proposals. And there the matter stands, so far as the efforts of the Court to bring the parties together are concerned. We may add that a copy of our pro-ceedings was each day transmitted to the Miners&apos; Federation so that they might be apprised of the course of events. We can only express our hope that by meeting in conference the parties may yet find a way to a settlement, for, after all, the terms on which the industry is to be carried on must, sooner or later, be settled between them. We cannot see what is to be gained by postponing the endeavour to reach agreement until the situation has become further embarrassed and the industry upon which both parties are dependent has been further, and perhaps, irre-mediably crippled. There has, in our view, been an insistence by both parties on formalities, the necessity for which, in a situation so desperate, we find it difficult to appreciate.Causes and Circumstances of the Dispute. 13. We now pass to consider the causes of the dispute. It is not a dispute concerned only with the wages of the industry although the parties have formally broken off on the proposals of the Mining Association for a new Wages Agreement. The origin of the trouble is much more deep-seated and is to be found in the deplorable condition of the industry itself. That the industry, in common with others, is experiencing a period of acute depression is a point upon which the Mine Owners and the Mine Workers are in complete agreement as appears from the Proceedings of the Joint Committee. Indeed the statistical information placed before us to this effect cannot be challenged. While the consumption of inland coal in 1924 as contrasted
with the consumption in 1913, instead of expanding with the growth of population, has receded by some four million tons, due to the falling off in the quantity used in the heavy industries, the decline in the export of coal can only be described as a slump. In 1913 over 73 million tons were exported while in 1924 the comparable figure had fallen below 60. million tons and for 1925 the total estimated figure based on the first six months&apos; expe-experience is under 50 million tons, an estimate which we were informed is unlikely to be realised owing to the continuing drop in the market.14. The causes of the decline in the demand for British coal are manifold. The general depression and disturbance of trade consequent upon the War is probably the most pervasive, a feature of this being the decreased purchasing power of customers abroad. Other causes are to be found in the substitution of oil for coal in ships, in the growth of hydro-electric power and con-conspicuously in the great increase of coal production in countries which were formerly our best customers. Competition by countries which have been able to undersell British coal has told heavily against the industry. Some of these causes must continue to operate more or less permanently in future. There is every indication that the world&apos;s total consumption of coal has declined but what is much more serious from our point of view is that Great Britain&apos;s share of the supply abroad has decreased in far greater proportion.15. The effect upon the coal industry in this country of the greatly diminished demand, accompanied by a marked decline in the prices obtainable for export coal, has been such that many collieries have of late been carried on at a loss, while others, unable to continue the struggle, have closed down. Figures were put before us which went to show that, of the six main coal areas of this country, four showed a loss over all per ton commercially disposable for the year to 30th of April, 1925, while the Eastern Area alone showed a substantial credit balance. During the period from June, 1924, to July, 1925, no fewer than 508 mines were closed and not reopened, involving 110,483 wage-earners, while only 96 mines, employing 8,522 wage-earners, were opened or reopened.16. We are indeed satisfied from an examination of all the evidence that during the operation of the new Agreement of 18th of June, 1924, coinciding as it did with a period of changes in industry and particularly in the export markets, there has been a definite worsening of the position. If we.analyse the figures more closely we find that the average monthly tonnage raised under the old Agreement during January to May, 1924, ^by collieries showing credit balances on the &quot; ascertainments &quot; was 19-18 millions, and the tonnage raised by collieries with debit balances was 3-36 millions; June, July and August, 1924, were exception-ally bad months, complicated by the transition from one Agree-ment to another; but the average of the seven months  September,   1924,  to  March,  1925 was  12-42  million  tons5390 i
raised by collieries with credit balances and 8-77 million tons raised by collieries with debit balances. To what extent this adverse change was due to the operation of the new Agreement and to what extent to the alteration in external conditions, is not precisely determina-ble, but in so far as the results of the final stages of the former Agreement were depen-dent upon export trade they were influenced by the exceptional situation created in European markets owing to the occupation of the Ruhr and the stimulation of British exports. To this extent, therefore, the later period, viz., September, 1924 to March, 1925, must, so far as external conditions are concerned be regarded as less disturbed by special features and can more accurately be described as a normal period. In any case the disparity between the results can hardly be assigned simply to the difference between the two Agreements but must also be due to the transition from a period of abnormal activity to one of more ordinary conditions.17. Treating the period of September, 1924, to March, 1925, therefore, as the most normal period during which the present Agreement was in operation, we cannot regard the results of the industry during that period as satisfactory. An examination of the figures shows that more than half the collieries were working on debit balances in every one of these seven months, except October, and over the whole period of seven months the number of collieries working on debit balances was well over 50 per cent. It was a feature of this period that the average output of the collieries showing credit balances was larger by one-third than those showing debit balances. This may be due, of course, partly to the fact that collieries losing money diminish their output as far as possible, but it also seems to indicate that, broadly speaking, the smaller collieries get into difficulties first. But over the whole of this seven months&apos; period the proportion of coal raised by collieries with debit balances was 41-4 per cent, of the total. The tonnage raised by losing collieries rose sharply at the end of the period from 8-6 millions to 9-9 in March. At this point, however, a distinctly new stage is reached and the results for April and May, and we understand also for June, constitute quite a new order and call for special comment.18. The number of collieries producing at a loss rose in April to over 64 per cent., and in May to nearly 67 per cent. The amount of coal raised by such collieries in May reached 60 per cent., being li8 millions, against 7-9 raised by collieries with credit balances. There is nothing in the seasonal nature of the industry which would account for a drop of this order; the corresponding months1 in 1924 showed a substantially higher total tonnage raised but comparatively little falling off corn-pared with the previous months.The comparable statistics of the export trade are :  In 1913-73-4 million tons.,, 1922-64-2     ,,,, 1923-78 0,, 1924-59-2
and for the first half year of 1925 to the end of June they were at the rate of 49-4, the price having dropped between January and June by over Is. 4d per ton. Our exports during June were 3-6 million tons being at the rate of 43-7 million tons per annum.19. The high cost of the production of coal, to which the Mining Association largely attributes the decline of the industry, is undoubtedly an important factor, and even if in this as well as in other respects the symptoms from which the industry is suffer-ing are characteristic of the economic position generally and are not peculiar to the coal industry, that industry by its nature is exceptionally sensitive to such influence. As regards export coal particularly, the trade has been conducted on very narrow margins and small reductions in cost may make all the difference between securing or failing to secure competitive contracts. The costs of production of coal fall under two heads, viz., wages and costs other than wages. In both respects costs have greatly increased since 1913. A comparative table placed before us showed a rise per ton commercially disposable from 9s. 5-5(M.. in 1913 to 19s. 0-69d in. May-December, 1924, or 101-49 per cent. On wages the increase was from 6s. 10-50tl to 13s. 6-46(1 or 96-92 per&apos; cent. The largest increases were in Workmen&apos;s Compensation 200-80 per cent., Managers, Secretary, Clerical and Administrative Staff 172-14 per cent, and Local Bates 133-87 per cent. In the case of a number of the items the increases were the result of obligations imposed upon the industry from without by the Legislature or otherwise. The following Table was ptit in, giving a &quot; Comparison of the Results of Colliery Working for the country as a whole, 1st of May, 1924 30th of April, 1925, with those for the year 1913 &quot; : - 	1913.	1st of May, 1924, to 30th of April, 1925.*	Percentage Increase or Decrease.Wages costs  ...

Were it not for the credit balance arising in the Eastern Area the Table would have shown a minus general balance instead of a credit of 3.66d.
Output and the Working Day.20. The evidence before us was largely devoted to demon-strating that the present high cost of production could be reduced by increasing the output. It appears to be the case that, coin-cidently with the shortening of the hours of labour, there has been a diminution in the output per person per shift, although the output per person per hour has slightly increased. But for the introduction of coal catting machines and conveyors (Vide Appendix No. IV) this reduction would have been greater to an extent which is not capable of exact demonstration or estimation. At the same time, the output per person per shift remains higher for Great Britain than in any other of the principal coal producing countries except Upper Silesia and the United States, in which latter country the geological conditions are not comparable. The proposition of the Mining Association was that if the Coal Mines Act of 1919 were repealed the output per shift would recover the diminution of nearly 12 per cent, attributed to the shortening of the working day, and probably more in view of the fact that that diminution was a net total reduction after allowing for the effect of new mechanical assislance which would, of course, still be available. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that the statutory seven hours&apos; day, like the previous statutory eight hours&apos; day, does not represent the whole time spent by the miner under-ground, as the time of one winding should be added, giving an average day of about seven and a half hours. The actual produc-tive working time is affected by the conditions of the individual pit.- The miner may have to traverse a considerable distance from the pit bottom to the working face.21. As regards the financial effect of the Act of 1919, the wage-earner thereafter continued to receive the same wages -for the shorter day with, as it has turned out, a diminished output, while the piece worker received a percentage increase of generally from 12 to 14 per cent, on his earnings. The hours of surface workers were simultaneously reduced from 49 to 461- Per wee^ without reduction of pay.22. The effect of a reversion to the former hours of working could not be precisely demonstrated even if every statistical element in the effects of the original reduction were available, because psychological considerations would also be of great importance. But assuming that the &quot; step back &quot; proved exactly similar in extent to the 1919 &quot; step forward,&quot; and would result in the restoration of the former output, the Mining Association proceeded to contend that with this larger output and consequent reduction in on cost as well as other economies, the total cost of production per ton would be diminished by about 2s. It appeared in the course of the evidence that the assumptions would justify a maximum estimated saving of 2s. 6d. This, the Mining Association contended, would enable the industry again to compete effectively in the export market as well as to reduce prices in the home market. This in turn, iS was argued, would enable  better wages conditions to be
accorded to the workers. At this stage also of the argument there is involved a large assumption, namely, that such a saving in costs and reduction in price would enable the industry to dispose of its whole increased output, notwithstanding the depressed and disturbed market conditions at home and abroad, and notwithstanding the large stocks of coal known to exist at present in foreign countries. Moreover, the saving of &apos;2s. 6d. would require to perform the double function on the one hand of assisting the earnings of the industry and on the other of permitting reductions in price. It has also to be remembered that in the case of the Durham and Northumberland Coalfields, which are exporting districts, the Act of 19.19 effected no reduc-tion of the actual hours worked at the face.23. We subjected this thesis of the Mining Association to a critical examination, which was perhaps more severe owing to the absence of the representatives of the Miners&apos; Federation, and we cannot say that it emerged altogether unscathed. We are prepared to agree that, if no other considerations were involved, a reversion to the former working day would result in a substantial increase of output and some diminution in working costs per ton, the extent or effect of which we do not find ourselves in a position to predict with assurance. It is fair to the Mining Association to say that they did not put their proposition forward as a panacea ; they contented themselves with stating that it would result in a substantial improvement in the economic position of the industry.Wages Position in the Industry.24. It was recognised throughout the hearing of the case that the proposal to lengthen the working day stood on a different footing from the proposal to alter the terms of the subsisting Wages Agreement. The former requires legislation, while the latter is a matter of contract within the competency of the parties them-selves. We devoted a considerable time to the examination of the wages position generally. The system of payment of wages in the industry is expounded in the Report of the Court of Inquiry held last year in consequence of the termination by the Miners&apos; Federation of the previously existing Wages Agreement. It is accordingly not necessary to restate the system here in detail. It may suffice to say that since the sliding scale of wages based on the selling price of coal was abolished, the fixing of wages has been based on the principle of relating them to the proceeds of the industry. For each mine there are recognised basis rates, both for day wage men and for piece workers. Some of these have been in operation for a long period of time. They are them-selves subject to local adjustment but are not readily disturbed. The machinery devised in 1921 was designed to arrive at the appropriate percentage to be added for each district to the basis rates for each class of workmen prevailing in each mine. The calculation prescribed is of a complicated character, into which there enter as factors the aggregate proceeds of the sale of coal for each district over an agreed period and a percentage apportion-ment between the mine owner and the workers. But this method
of wages ascertainment was qualified by two important provisos. If the wages yielded by the calculation proved less than 20 per cent, over the current basis rates plus the district percentage addition in force in 1914 the apportionment principle of the Wages Agreement ceased to operate and this minimum percentage became payable. Further, where the Agreement did not other-wise yield a subsistence wage to low-paid day wage workers provision was made for additional allowances per shift to such workers, to&apos; be determined separately for each district.25. Following upon the Report of the Court of Inquiry last year certain modifications were made upon the terms of the Wages Agreement of 1921 and the Wages Agreement of 18th of June, 1924, now under notice of termination was approved. The principle was not altered but there were important modifications made on the terms. These consisted chiefly in raising the120 per cent, minimum to 33J per cent., in increasing the scale of allowances to low paid day wage workeirs and in lowering the percentage apportionments to the owners. The Mining Asso-ciation submitted to us that in the existing state of the industry it was impossible to carry on under this Wages Agreement and that its continued operation would mean economic ruin to a large number of collieries which would be obliged to close down. On the other hand it seems to have been the case that the Agree-ment was not giving satisfaction to the mine workers either, though for other reasons, and that there was indeed an inclina-tion on their part also to give notice for its termination. It appears to be the case that under the existing agreement the wages paid to the workers on the average are less than the pre-war rates plus an addition representing the official figure for the increased cost of living.Wages Proposals of the Mining Association.26. We made a detailed examination of the effect of the new principles put forward by the Mining Association for the ascer-tainment of wages after 31st of July. (See Appendix III.) The method proposed is : (1) to ascertain the total proceeds of the industry in each area ;(2) to deduct therefrom the costs of production other than wages ;(3) to take 87 per cent, of the balance; (4) to deduct from the amount so determined any special allowances made to low-paid day wage men; and finally(5) to express the ultimate balance as a percentage of the wages paid at basis rates during the period of ascertainment. It is further proposed that such provision as may be necessary to meet the case of any low-paid day wage man in any district should be dealt with in that district as a. district question.   The ascertainment of the percentage addition to be made to the basis
rates in each district would no doubt, by the adoption of this method, be greatly simplified by the elimination of complicated calculations and of any reference back to 1914.27. On a scrutiny of these proposals, the cardinal innovation is seen to be the absence of any prescribed minimum below which wages must not fall. If the ultimate balance on the calculation proved to be a minus quantity it is not clear whether basis rates would be payable in any event and the percentage addition alone would be effected, or whether the basis rates themselves would suffer a percentage reduction. Upon this point our inquiries did not   elicit a definite answer, but the latter would appear to be the correct inference from Mr. Williams&apos; evidence. The only safe-guard proposed against the indefinite diminution of wages is that provision may be made in each district to meet the case of low-paid day wage men, presumably by a subsistence allowance, with which we deal later. Another conspicuous feature of the pro-posals is that 13 per cent, of the proceeds of the industry, after deduction of the costs of production other than wages, is first credited to the owners in the calculation. In this way the 13 per cent, goes to the credit of the owners collectively in each district irrespective of what the resultant rate of wages may prove to be. It is not a credit or profit to the individual owner, but to the area owners as a group. This has been represented as a guaranteed profit to the owners of 13 per cent, irrespective of wages. As, however, the wages are paid out as the work pro-ceeds while the ascertainments take place periodically on past results, it does not follow that the owners collectively will always actually get this 13 per cent, in each district&apos; It is only if the ups and downs of proceeds and costs other than wages work out at an average level of values that the full 13 per cent, will actually be received by the owners in each district. On a continuously falling market the worker would suffer by periodic diminutions of his percentage addition, but the owners would not actually realise 13 per cent. The point remains, however, that in the ascertainment of the workers&apos; wages 13 per cent, of the net proceeds of the industry (after deduction of costs other than wages) is always under this method first credited to the owners, and it is broadly true that in the long run they will realise this pi&apos;ofit. It should be added that the owners represented that the 13 per cent, would not in any event be net profit, inasmuch as it would be subject to various further charges in their hands esti-rnated at about 3d. per ton. We were not in a position to check this estimate. At the same time, under the owners&apos; present pro-posals, there is no place for the principle of &quot;recoupment which is part of the existing arrangement, and the adoption of these proposals would involve the giving up by the owners of nine million pounds of &quot; recoupment &quot; arrears.28. In considering the operation of these proposals it must be borne in mind that the apportionment principle of the existing Wages Agreement in practice only affects certain of the wage
J6earners &quot;and certain districts. Whenever the minimum is reached, as it frequently has been, the &quot; ascertainment &quot; machinery of the Agreement ceases to operate. On the other hand, in the case of the present proposals, the system, apan from the provision as to subsistence allowances to low-paid day wage men, would operate universally and no fall in wages, how-ever great, would arrest its action. There is the further material observation to be made that for the future as the subsistence allowances are proposed to be deducted from the 87 per cent, these allowances are really proposed to be charged upon the wages of the better-paid men and are not to any extent to be borne by the 13 per cent, to be credited to the owners, who will thus cease to have any financial interest in the amount of these allowances ^whereas they have hitherto been interested in the matter to the extent of at least 12 per cent. We endeavoured to ascertain how these proposals, if carried into effect, would actually affect current rates of wages. It was admitted that they would entail an immediate, and in many cases a material, diminution in actual wager, paid, varying according to the dis-tricts. Until the new subsistence allowances are determined a complete representation of the new position in money wages can-not be given. We came to the conclusion that, as the owners were in process of preparing the new wage lists which they proposed to post at the collieries, it was undesirable to pursue the topic. It is clear, however, from the above brief examination of the owners&apos; proposals for a new Wages Agreement in substitution for the existing Agreement, that they involve departures from the present system of a very material character and are naturally viewed with anxiety by the miners.29. The justification put forward by the Mining Association for their proposals is simple. They say that more cannot be taken out of an industry than there is in if; that no industry can continue to be carried on unless it yields a return in profit; that the existing Wages Agreement is economically impossible as the financial results of its working have shown; and that the pro-posed new terms represent a reasonable allocation of the proceeds of the industry as between wages and profit in both good and bad times. -30. Assuming that no more can be got out of the industry than it is at present yielding a matter with which we shall deal later  the position taken up by the owners is unanswerable if regard is to be had only to the economic considerations affecting the industry. An industry conducted on commercial lines cannot pay uneconomic wages, that is, wages which absorb more than the industry is bringing in, or wages which absorb so much of what the industry is bringing in as to leave no sufficient margin of profit, to make it worth while to carry on the industry. Such a state of affairs, if merely temporary, may be tided over with the aid of internal resources, but if it threatens to be long continued involves inevitable ultimate disaster.   All development of the
industry becomes impossible. We recognise that, if the present condition of the industry continues, an increasing number of collieries will find it impossible financially to carry on under the existing Wages Agreement. In many cases their position under the Agreement is already economically unsound. If they are to continue working on an economic basis some drastic remedy is necessary.General Considerations.31. The miners naturally approach the problem from an entirely different aspect. They concern themselves hot with the economic wage, but with what they term a &quot; living wage.&quot; They represent that unless they receive a remuneration for their labour which at least represents what thej&apos; received before the war equated to the present cost of living they cannot carry on the lives of themselves and their families any more than the Owners can carry on their collieries if they have to pay more than an economic price for labour. It is precisely here that the deadlock arises. If the economic wage which an industry can afford to pay is less than the social wage to coin an expression  which the worker requires to maintain himself and his family in accordance with a reasonable standard of living, the dilemma becomes insoluble. When this point is reached in the case of an ordinary commercial undertaking, when, that is, the concern cannot pay wages upon which the worker engaged in the concern can live, the undertaking closes down. It can no longer attract or retain labour, and so must come to a stop. In the present case we do not feel called upon to define what is a &quot; living wage &apos;&apos; for a mine worker. We ought perhaps to note in passing that the mine owners suggested that the wages paid in 1914 were at an exceptionally high level, and that for a comparison with pre-War rates an average over a series of the years before the War should be taken. If, however, the economic wage which the mine owners can afford to pay in the future be in fact less than the workers can reasonably be asked to live upon, then the industry has reached a pass where in any ordinary business con-cern closing down would be the only course. So far we have been speaking of the industry as if it were a single concern, but, in point of fact, it consists of some three thousand collieries whose financial positions vary widely. Thus the wage which can be paid on an economic basis at one colliery may be substantially larger than that which can be paid at another. Collieries are good, bad and indifferent from the paying point of view. It may be, therefore, that a restriction of the industry to those under -takings which can afford, on an economic basis, to pay wages upon which the worker can reasonably be asked to live and the elimination -tion of the undertakings which cannot pay such wages is theoreti-ca-lly the appropriate solution. But the full reactions of this step would extend far beyond the industry itself and have serious consequences for the country as. well as for the large body
of workers who would be thrown out of employment. Wider consideraions thus arise at this stage.32. This leads us to ask whether the coal industry is one whose fate from the national point of view can be left to be determined by the unmitigated operation of purely economic forces. It is a basic industry whose product is indispensable for our industrial commercial and domestic life. Upon its continuance on its present scale many interests depend. It affords moreover the means of livelihood to a tenth of our population. A drastic restriction of its activities would be fraught with grave conse-quences. These, however, are wider questions and do not fall within our terms of reference.33. Sir Josiah Stamp, a member of the Court, considers that the situation is not fully explained without reference to recent national financial policy. This aspect of the case was only incidentally referred to in evidence, and the two other members of the Court do not feel themselves qualified to deal with it. We have accordingly printed a separate Addendum on the point for which he alone is responsible.Conclusions.34. We are satisfied on one point, that the workers are justified in claiming that any Wages Agreement which they can be asked to accept should provide for a minimum wage. What that minimum should be is a matter for negotiation between the parties. We do not think that a method of fixing wages which allows of their indefinite diminution can be regarded as satisfae-tory. It may be said that when under such a system the wages fall too low the worker can decline to continue to give his labour, but the absence of any basis of security is the feature which renders unacceptable a scheme which provides for unlimited variations downwards, subject only to the mitigation by unspeci-fied subsistence allowances, with the result that until the minimmn subsistence allowance level is reached for every worker in each district the process of diminishing wages could continue to proceed. The claim that wages must be a first charge on the proceeds of industry is a contentious and ambiguous one. If the meaning be that wages at some agreed minimum rate must in practice be a charge before profits are taken we concur in that view. We have not overlooked the existence of the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act, 1912, which applies to all underground workers, subject to certain conditions and exceptions The pro-visions of that Act cannot, of course, be abrogated by anything which the parties may choose to do. We expressed surprise that so little was heard of this Act in connection with the present controversy, but Mr. Williams explained that as it applied in effect to only a limited number of the workers it was really negligible as a basis of regulation of wages in the industry.35. We have hitherto discussed the situation on the footing that it discloses a conflict between the economic wage which the
coal industry can afford to pay, and the social wage which the worker can be asked to accept. But that is not the whole of the case. Apart from the wages costs which constitute the largest part of the outgoings of a colliery there are other costs of a lesser but still important character. The Miners&apos; Federation in their series of Propositions (Appendix No. II) have indicated a number of directions in which they suggest that some measure of &quot;relief might be found apart from reductions in wages. Owing to the abstention of the Miners&apos; Federation from our proceedings we were deprived of the opportunity of hearing these proposals ex-pounded by their promoters and of examining them in any detail. We drew the attention of the representatives of the mine owners who appeared before us to these subjects, but the view which they expressed was that there was&apos;nothing in them, taken collectively, which would enable the industry to pay any increase in wages over what it is able to pay as it is conducted at the present time. Nevertheless, we venture to think that there is considerable room for&apos; improving the efficiency of the industry as a whole, and in this way affording some aid to its economic position. Further collective action on the part of collieries, for example,- would enable facilities and resources to be used in common to greater advantage and would promote economical working. It is also for consideration whether the industry should remain in isolation or whether by its co-ordination with other enterprises better results might not be obtained. The increased cost of the trans-port and shipment of coal is another factor meriting investiga-tion. The improvement of the distribution of coal while not entering directly into the present question has an important indirect bearing upon it for it would result in kwering the price to all classes of consumers and might have a considerable effect in stimulating demand. The question of the continuance of the royalty system on its present basis is also an important one, for although the charge upon the industry under this head is unim-portant relatively to the wages bill, it is not negligible. It has been the source of much ill feeling among the ranks of the workers, where the promotion of goodwill is of so much import-ance. As we have not had the advantage of evidence upon any of these or other similar matters we leave the subject with, the general observation that we cannot believe that there is no room for improvement in the management, organisation and develop-ment of the industry, or that no alleviation is to be found in these directions. It should be added that any steps of this nature would not meet the present emergency for they would necessarily take some time to produce any appreciable results. Some of them might involve expenditure for which it would be difficult to obtain money while the industry remained in its present condition which, is not calculated to inspire confidence in the investor. But these matters ought not to be overlooked in any projects for the permanent rehabilitation of the industry.36. One general conclusion has been forced upon us by our investigation.   The present crisis in the industry, unlike other
crises which have arisen in the past, is to a large extent the creation of neither party to the dispute. It&apos; has arisen in the main from without and is due to causes not within the control of either party. These causes are to be found in the operation of national and international disturbances and dislocations which are the inevitable sequel of the economic upheaval due to the War. They are causes which may continue to operate for a con-sideisable time to come. In such a crisis it is perhaps not un-natural that each party should seek to transfer to the other us much as possible of the consequences of the common calamity. But just because the calamity is a common one not primarily due to the fault of either, we venture to think that in taking common counsel together the parties are most likely to find a means of averting its worst consequences.37. We think it right to add that the report which we now present to you has been prepared under the pressure of extreme urgency. Our effective inquiry began on the 20th of July and lasted for four days. Our reiDort has been completed within the week. We cannot hope that in dealing so summarily with this complicated investigation we have escaped errors either of omission or of commission, and we are very sensible of the inevitable inadequacy of our treatment of the subject.38. To Mr. Hurst, of the Mines Department, and Mr;&quot; Ince, of the Ministry of Labour, who acted as our Secretaries, we desire to express our indebtedness for much assistance.We have the honour- to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,H.

Addendum to Paragraph 14 by Sir Josiah Stamp.The stale of the industry under the operation of the present Agreement was demonstrably unsatisfactory in the light of its history during the first six or seven months, but I find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the rapid worsening of the position in the last four or five months, if it is to be fully accounted for, indicates the existence of some special pre-disposing cause. In looking for such a cause (and making due allowance for the the depression in the coal industry elsewhere) I have been unable to find anything in the actual course or conduct of the industry itself adequate to account for such a marked change for the worse in the last period, and I cannot escape the conclusion that there have been factors in operation more deep-seated than those to which the majority of the leaders in the industry itself have been alive.I wish to disavow any desire to bring any current political issues into this report, but as the terms of reference impose on me a statement of &quot; causes &quot; I cannot avoid reference to economic factors merely because they do not act on the surface, and still less because they may he for the moment in that political field with which I have usually no concern. In my own judg-ment, with all due appreciation of the virtues of the gold standard, as such, it was always open to doubt in the period January to March, 1925, whether its introduction would not involve a considerable degree of actual deflation, either at the moment of introduction, or the period prior thereto (during which such action was being anticipated), and whether such deflation would not inevitably be so one-sided in becoming effective as to cause much industrial unrest. The position of the dollar-sterling exchange, as such, lent colour to the superficial view that the degree of deflation necessary to make the gold: standard effective would be small, but; I had always the underlying feeling that special causes relating to money rates in London designed to retain foreign balances here, together with that false appreciation due to anticipation, masked the true relative position of the British sterling price level and the world gold price level. The actual &quot; step down &quot; as indicated by the exchanges appeared small, but the real &quot; step down &quot; judged by relative price levels seemed likely to&apos; be severe. But the figures of the exchange situation are known immediately, whereas the price level position is known only some time after the date to which it has related. Only those in the inner circle of banking and international money movements can judge whether the face value of the current exchange is influenced by special conditions, correction for which would indicate that the price level parity was more divergent. One could only assume that on the introduction of the gold standard such responsible persons in a position to judge would be con-confident that the real &quot; step down.&quot; was not too severe a jolt for
industry Even in February last it was obvious to me that if the true, gap between the British sterling and the American gold price levels was substantial the attainment of the gold standard would be won at a material immediate cost to industry, and that even the preparatory steps would cause a painful reaction.1 There were indeed criticisms that the one thing wanted in order to secure more trade was a reduction in our prices, but it was clear that the considerable reduction in sterling prices (now oold prices) in a neutral market would cut out the margin of profit on exports unless we were prepared to reduce the cost of industry at home, including toages, in accordance and simultaneously there-with; that simultaneous restatements in terms of money of all the values entering into new production and commerce was necessary if their relative proportions were not to be violent])&apos; disturbed ; and that as such, adjustments in the case of wages would be, from the human standpoint, with so much unemploy-ment, very difficult, we should still probably have to quote prices abroad that would be above the competitive level.However, at the time of the actual introduction of the gold standard it might well be assumed that those on whose advice the change would be taken were in a position to know the mone-tary influences at work, and knew enough about the real extent of necessary deflation to make any such fears, based on less wide information, groundless. But recent weeks have in-increasingly indicated that such an assumption must have been ill-founded, and that a considerable measure of deflation was, in fact, involved.The &quot; Times &quot; Index of Prices shows a continuous drop for six months January to June from 179 to 155 a fall of nearly 14 per cent.2 It is quite obvious that if the British exporter has to face a diminution in his receipts per unit of production upon this scale, and has no power to secure an immediate reduction on his outgoings (other than raw materials) he must work at a severe loss, either by actually selling goods at a loss or by quoting too high prices and not selling goods at all. To quote the old price in a foreign currency, which has successfully com-peted before in that currency, means, when the sterling exchange has improved and it takes more of that foreign currency to buy a given sum in sterling, a lower yield in our currency. Conversely, to get the same nominal price in sterling with an &quot; improved &quot; exchange, means more units of the foreign currency i.e., a higher price in that currency. It ought to be obvious that those of our exports on which there are fine margins in close corn-petition would be the first to feel the pinch. The coal industry, starting from the point of having little margin of profit at all into which to cut, would readily be put into serious difficulties. More-over, coal is sensitive to foreign competition to a peculiar degree, because it not only suffers its own direct troubles in a curtailment1 Vide The Times, March 3 and 27, 1925.2 The TJ.S. Bureau of LabouT Price Index stood in June at the samo level as in December, 1924.
of.-exported coal, but it feels tbe&apos;:reduction in: other classes of ex-ports,, such, as.-iron and steel, in the most immediate and direct way. - In my view, therefore,- the recent improvement in. the exchange or decline in the price level, to which I have referred, whether or not compulsorily brought about by the anticipation and then the-realisation of the gold standard1 is sufficient in itself to account for the special plight of the industry since March. There would appear to be no way in which the competitive position of coal prices can be restored unless and until (a) the costs in this country are reduced, or (6) the gold costs of the other competitive countries; are: raised, either by gold inflation there, or by less efficiency, shorter hours and higher wages abroad. The wit-nesses before us had no diiect evidence at all -as indeed it would be difficult for them to have upon these underlying economic forces. They had the general impression that the resumption of the gold standard means a shilling per ton difference in price, but prima facie, the real effect of it might be considerably greater than a general impression would convey. I am, therefore, obliged to conclude (a) that whatever the effect of the operation of the pre-sent agreement might be upon the industry in the long run, it was bound to be made substantially worse by that kind of one-sided deflation which has taken place, and (b) that no other satisfactory or sufficient cause appears to be available, though I give full weight to the general depression in coal consumption abroad.There is a second deep-seated cause partly linked with the foregoing, but partly of independent origin which I feel may not have been without its influence, but upon which I am bound to say I have less definite views. Our export trade in the past-has fulfilled two functions : it has partly purchased us food and raw materials from abroad, and it has partly extended our foreign investments. I know it may be said that our interest from foreign investments has been available and has been left abroad for the latter purpose, but one cannot assign a particular out-going to a particular incoming, and therefore, it is just as logical to say that the food and raw materials brought in represented our foreign interest, and that our foreign investments were made by exports of coal, iron, steel, etc. Wo can only in the long run, invest money abroad if it is actually being saved in this country. If our total savings should shrink materially we must expect this to have an influence upon the amount available for foreign investment. It we try to invest more abroad than this amount-available, we must expect to have a derangement of the exchanges. The recent limitation of foreign borrowing on the London market is merely an outward expression of these inevit-able facts. If we have either in fact, or artificially by such an arrangement, less money to lend abroad, it is to be expected that1 Supposing the altered! price level to be caused in this way, this is not the place to discuss how far this industrial condition is a proper price to pay for the counter advantages of the gold standard.
our whole export trade would feel it, and, moreover, that that sensitive end of our exports, consisting of coal, should be rapidly affected. The situation is not materially different if we are buying far more than we are selling and balancing the account by increased borrowing from abroad, and/or decreased lendings abroad. For these reasons I do not think the state of affairs in the coal industry in the last few months must be regarded as the necessary result either of normal trade movements or the present Agreement.   Currency policy has aggravated the evil.J. C. STAMP.

Capital Expenditure.The workmen are not satisfied that all items of capital expenditure are excluded from the ascertainments. They will raise this question and will endeavour to insure:  (a) That the accountants are allowed -access to all necessary books, accounts -and documents, and will, in fact, have the right to make an unrestricted test audit.(b) That the form and certificate as requested in the Federation letter of October, 1923, be put into immediate operation.(c) That the workmen&apos;s accountants shall have the right to call in representatives! of the workmen to assist and advise upon questions which may involve capital expenditure.II. Excluded Departments.The workmen are not satisfied that the results of the industry, to which their wages are subject, should cover the pit head proceeds of the raw coal only; they desire to share in the results of the industry in the
widest sense, and to this end they will request information from and will desire to discuss with the owners, the desirability of including the earnings of:  Coking and by-product plants, smokeless fuel plant. ; -Electric power plant, washeries, etc., etc. Patent fuel.&apos;   Selling agencies, merchanting depots, private railways!   , Brickworks, clay and ironstone, and other ancillary minerals.

They desire to discuss and examine this question with a view to better results being obtained.IV. Administration.The workmen are not satisfied that the present administration of the collieries is not&apos; capable of improvement from the point of view of offieiency and economy. Under this heading they particularly desire information upon, and to discuss and examine with the owners, the following questions:  (a) The numbers of certain classes- of- officials as compared with pre-War days.(b) The amount of directors&apos; fees.(c) The multiplicity of directorships,: and, consequently, of the fees taken by individuals.(d) The buying of colliery stores and timber.V. Organisation of Distribution.   .The workmen are not satisfied that the present methods of distribu-tion are the most efficient and economical.   They desire information upon this matter, and desire to examine it from the point where the coal reaches the pit head to the point when delivery 1 to the consumer ..... is effected.    . .,     , ......Vl! Multiple Ownership in Industry.The workmen are not satisfied that multiple ownership in industry does not have -a strong bearing upon, and a detrimental effect upon, wages in the coal trade, e:g., certain companies not only own collieries, but iron and steel works, ships, manufacturing concerns, railways, etc., 1   etc:, in&apos;&apos;addition; in some cases they also have similar interests abroad.The workmen desire information upon this question,  and desire to &apos;&apos;examine and discuss&apos; with the owners the effect thereof upon wages in the coal1 industry.     &apos;    - &quot;.Note.

Inquiry before Closing of Pits.The workmen will desire to put forward a claim that before any colliery ceases work or closes down owing to alleged financial difficulties an inquiry into&apos; the circumstances shall first be held.IX. The workmen would like to hear the explanation of the owners in respect of the following question:  Notwithstanding the relative increase in the price of coal, why does the present Agreement give inferior results to the workmen than those obtained under the old Conciliation Board Agreements ?X. Preferential Treatment to Selected Classes.The workmen are still profoundly dissatisfied with the preferential treatment accorded to selected classes, at the expense of the larger body of workmen; they will desire to raise this question with a view to its being remedied.Note. Whe2i discussing (I), (II) and (III) above, the workmen&apos;s representatives will intimate to the owners the desirability of putting Part II of the Mining Industry Act, 1920, into operation, and will ask that the owners should join the workmen in requesting the Govern-ment t:. give legislative effect thereto.APPENDIX III.The Mining Association of Great Britain. Proposals for a, New Wages Agreement.1. A National Board shall be constituted consisting in equal numbers of persons chosen by the Mining Association of Great Britain and persons chosen by the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain.There shall also be established Area Boards, consisting in equal numbers of persons representing owners and workmen in each area.The National and Area Boards shall draw up their own rules of pro-cedure, which shall include a provision for the appointment of an Independent Chairman for each Board.2. The wages payable in each area shall be expressed in the form of a percentage of the basis rates then prevailing, and shall be periodically adjusted in accordance with the results of the industry as ascertained in such area.3. The amount of the percentage to be paid in each area during any period shall be determined by the results of the industry in that airea during a previous period, as ascertained by returns to be made by the owners, checked by joint test andit of the owners&apos; books carried out by independent accountants appointed by each side.4. In order to determine the percentage payable in accordance with paragraph 3, 87 per cent, of the difference between the proceeds in each area and the costs of production other than wages shall be taken; from the amount so determined shall be deducted any special allowances paid under paragraph 5, and the balance so remaining shall be expressed as a percentage of the wages paid at basis rates during the period of ascertainment.5. Such provision as may be necessary to meet the case of any low-paid day wage man in any district shall be dealt with in that district as a district question.
6.
