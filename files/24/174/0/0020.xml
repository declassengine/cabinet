Copy No.    ^0CP. 321 (25).CABINET.PARLIAMENTARY,  &amp;c, CANDIDATURE OF STATE SERVANTS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared in the Treasury in regard to the Report of the Committee on the Parliamentary, &amp;c, Candidature of Crown Servants (Command Paper 2408).* I am being pressed on this matter, and I should therefore be glad of an early decision by the Cabinet, in order that I may be in a position to aunounce the considered views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, July 2, 1925.Parliamentary, &amp;c, Candidature of State Servants.The report of the Committee appointed under the chairmanship of Lord Blanesburgh to enquire into the regulations governing the candidature for Parliament and for municipal bodies of persons in the service of the Crown raises important issues, on wdiich it is necessary to obtain a Cabinet decision.The existing regulations were reviewed in 1923 by a Cabinet Committee, presided over by the present Lord Chancellor.   This Committee recommended :  . 1. That no alteration should be made in the existing rule, which requires a Civil Servant to resign his position as soon as he issues his address to the electors or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate for election to the House of Commons ; and 2. That the above rule should be extended forthwith to all members of the three fighting services.It was proposed to take legislation on the subject, and, pending legislation, to bring the recommendations into immediate effect by Order in Council.Before effect could be given to the recommendations of the Cave Committee, the Government had changed hands- Many members of the Labour Government were committed to the policy of &quot; full civil rights&quot; for Civil Servants. Nevertheless, that Government decided in the first instance to appoint a Committee to examine the question, and the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, in answer t,o a question in the House of Commons, endorsed the traditional custom that employees of the established Civil Service should take no overt part in public political affairs.The Committee so appointed by the Labour Government consisted, in addition to Lord Blanesburg, of five members Mr. G. N. Barnes. Mr. J. R. M. Butler. Sir A. Kaye Butterworth. Mr. Arthur Shaw. Miss Helen Ward.[13289]* Copy attached.
The Committee agree unanimously, subject only to the exceptions mentioned below, that the general rule should be identical for all Crown Servants, and should take the form of the existing Civil Service rule, whereby candidature for Parliament involves resignation from the Service.As to the exceptions to this general rule, the Committee hold divided views. They all agree that industrial staffs employed in establishments where the employment is predominantly industrial should be excepted. Some of the Committee, however, would go further than this and except (i) industrial staffs in all Departments, e.g., in the Post Office ; (ii) with certain reservations, manipulative grades and the like, e.g., postmen, messengers. With regard to staff so excepted, the Committee are unanimous that successful Parliamentary candidature should involve resignation of employment from the date of election. They note, however, that under the industrial system of weekly wages with no security an industrial employee is eligible for employment or re-employ-men t irrespective of his previous employment, and express the view that in such cases there need be no discrimination against the industrial employee who has been a Member of Parliament. On the other hand, pension or other rights which are lost on voluntary resignation would, be equally lost on election to Parliament.The Cabinet will presumably endorse without qualification the findings of the Committee on the main question of principle. It remains to consider the question whether any, and if so what, exceptions to the general rule are to be admitted. The objection to admitting exceptions to the general rule is not that there is any harm in allowing a dockyard labourer to stand for Parliament without resigning his employ -ment, but that once any exception at all is made to the general rule, it becomes difficult to draw the line. If a workman in Portsmouth Dockyard is excepted, why not a workman in the Post Office, and if a workman in the Post Office, why not a postman or a telegraphist, and if a telegraphist, why not a clerk &apos;? Nevertheless, it may well be that the immediate admission of certain exceptions may in the long run help to preserve rather than to destroy the general principle ; and it is suggested that the Committee&apos;s conclusions, in so far as they are unanimous, should be approved.It is understood that the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air are prepared to accept the Comiriittee&apos;s recommenda-tions affecting the fighting services.

REPORT.To the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury.may it please your lordships.1. We were appointed by Treasury Minutes dated the 10th April and 5th May, 1924, to enquire into the existing regulations governing the candidature for Parliament and tor municipal bodies of persons in the service of the Crown and to report whether any, and if so, what changes should be made in.those regulations.We have held 15 meetings and have received written and/or oral evidence from 21 witnesses (of whom a list appears in the Appendix) comprising representatives of the Departments administering the fighting services, of the two main federations of Associations of Government civil employees, of large employ-ing Departments and of the Treasury, political scientists and representatives of the Dominions. We have also had before us the observations of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service presided over by Lord MjacDonnell, which in Chapter 11 of its -Fourth Report (Cd. 7338 of 1914) refers to the subject of our reference.2. We were aware that prior to our appointment the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Snowden, in answer to a question in the House of Commons on 14th February, 1924, had stated that he gave his support to the traditional custom that employees of the established Civil Service should take no- overt part in public political affairs, and we have noted that this broad question is not mentioned in our terms of reference It has, however, not been possible to exclude it altogether from view, although, as explained later, we have not considered it to be a question referred to us for report.3. We were aware also that the reference to ourselves was the result of a request made to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the existing restrictions on the Parliamentary candidature of civilian Government employees should be removed, for the reason, amongst others, that more favoured treatment was in this matter extended to the fighting services. We have accordingly enquired into the regulations governing the fighting services in this respect, but we have not &quot;treated ourselves as being limited to a mere Consideration of whether or no the civil services should be brought into line with them or vice versa: We have endeavoured to consider on its merits the position of all Crown employees in this matter.We have not regarded the police as covered by our enquiry. But for purposes of record we have ascertained that Police are52992 a 2
prohibited by statute from endeavouring to persuade an elector to vote in any particular way. The Police Disqualification (Removal) Acts of 1887 and 1893 abolished the previous statutory prohibition on their voting at elections.Existing Rules.4. The existing rules governing the Navy, Army, Air Force and Civil Service respectively appear to be as follows : Naval and Marine Officers and Ratings.(a) General political activities.Serving officers and ratings, by the custom of the service, are not permitted to make political speeches or to canvass at elections, or in any other way to take an active part in politics.An Officer infringing this rule is placed upon half-pay for such period of time as is considered desirable by the Admiralty. But an isolated infringement does not prevent an officer from being considered for another full-pay appointment. Should it appear, however, that the officer is definitely mixing in politics he is left cn half-pay as long as: he manifests a disposition to put these activities before his service duties. He thus runs the risk of being retired under the Regulations for non-service.No instance had occurred of a serving Rating infringing the rule, and no procedure had been laid down for dealing with such a case. But we were informed that it would not be possible to deal with a rating on exactly the same lines as an officer because there is no half-pay system for ratings, and it would not be to their interest to introduce one.(b) Candidature at Elections.The following are the existing rules : (i) Officers. and men invited to stand as Parliamentary Candidates must obtain the permission of the Admiralty to do so through the usual service channels. The granting of such permission must depend upon the exigencies of the service. Where such permission has been granted to a serving officer or man, he may be granted leave of absence to appear before the duly accredited Committee or Association of the recognised Party or other body of persons proposing to adopt him. The leave may commence eight days before the issue of the Proclamation or Writ, (ii) Should the candidate be nominated, this period of leave will be extended so as.to cover the dates of the Elec-tion and declaration of the Poll, (iii) An officer on full pay or man who has been given permis-sioir as above to stand as a Parliamentary Candidate may   during  the   period   above-mentioned   address
I meetings and otherwise prosecute his own candida-ture, but must not wear Naval uniform while so engaged.(iv) An officer (R.N. or R..M.) on full or unemployed pay who, having received permission to stand, is elected to Parliament, will be placed on half-pay, and Will be subject to the ordinary rules of retirement for non-service. In similar circumstances a Naval rating will be given the. option of taking a free discharge or of being transferred to the Royal Fleet Reserve for a period not exceeding two years, during which he may elect to take his discharge or may, subject to Admir-alty permission, revert to the Active Service to com-plete his engagement.(v) In the case of an officer on full pay., who is not elected to Parliament and vacates his appointment during the leave year in which the special leave referred to in paragraph (ii) above is granted, such leave will be treated as ordinary leave for purposes of calculating the balance due on ceasing duty.(c) Candidature for County Councils, Municipal Bodies, tie.There are no definite rules laid down with reference to this matter. We learn that Naval Officers and men would not ordinarily be prevented from becoming candidates for or from sitting on such bodies, if their service duties were not thereby interfered with.Army Officers and Soldiers.5. The present rules governing the Parliamentary candidature of serving officers of the Army are as follows : An officer may stand as a candidate, without obtaining special leave, but in practice he asks for leave in the ordinary way. Full pay is drawn during candidature. From the date of election, however, officers of the rank of Major and below (except officers of the Royal Engineers) have the option of either (a) being seconded, without pay from Army Funds, but with the right to promotion while so seconded, or (b) being placed on half-pay which is drawn in addition to Parliamentary pay, but without the right to promotion while so placed. Lieutenant-Colonels and higher ranks and Royal Engineer Officers of whatever rank cannot be seconded, but are placed on half-pay. In neither case does the time spent in Parliament count either for increase of pay or for retired pay. The rules for retirement depend upon rank :  General Officers must retire after three years&apos; non-employment : Colonels may remain on half-pay indefinitely, until retired for age. Ranks below Colonel are retired after five years on half-pay but ranks below Lieutenant-Colonel, if seconded, may remain in Parliament for ten years without retiring from the Army. Dur-ing the War, officers who were Members of Parliament were called up and restored to the full-pay list, under special authority,
and were allowed, if they so chose, to draw their Parliamentary allowance in addition.No ca.se has occurred of a soldier contesting a Parliamentary election., though he is stated to be at liberty to do so. His position, after election, has not so far been made the subject of regulation.As regards general political activities, these are regarded as undesirable, and an officer or other rank may not make a political speech unless he is an adopted candidate.Royal Air Force Officers and Airmen.6. The rules are modelled generally on those for the Army.Royal Air Force officers on full pay, or on half-pay Scale A, are placed on. half-pay Scale B as from the date of election. No rule as to airmen has so far been formulated.As regards general political activities officers and airmen are prohibited from taking part in these in the vicinity of barracks, quarters, or camps, and a more stringent rule has just been intro-duced under which no officer or airman on full pay may make a political speech unless he is the adopted candidate for a con-stituency.Civil Service.7. It is not always remembered that very many Civil Servants are expressly disqualified by Statute from being elected to the House of Commons. These disqualifications being contained in Statutes of George II and George III are expressed in language not always in terms appropriate to the present organisation of the service and their precise application to existing conditions may not be in all cases easy to determine. No useful purpose would be served by our attempting to determine it. Let it suffice to say that by 15 Geo. 2 c, 22 all the clerks in the Treasury, the Admiralty and the offices of the Principal Secretaries of State are certainly so disqualified, and there are many others. We cannot doubt that the service rule upon this subject, which in its existing form has been in force for over 40 years, is based upon these statutory disqualifications, now almost forgotten though still in force the rule merely extending and unifying them so as to make applicable to the whole service disqualifica-tions with reference to which there was apparently not by the framers of the rule supposed to be room for logical discrimination.Apart from these statutory disqualifications the existing rules as to Parliamentary and other candidature may be summarised as follows : (a) Parliamentary Candidature.8. The present rule is contained in Clause 16 of the Order in Council of the 10th January, 1910 (consolidating previous orders). It runs : &quot; Any officer seeking a seat in the House of Commons shall resign his office as soon as he issues his address to the electors, or in any other manner publicly announces himself as a candidate.&quot;
This rule does not apply to Civil Servants retired on pension. It dates from 1884, when questions arising out of a case of such candidature were asked in the House of Commons and the follow-ing Treasury Minute was issued notifying the decision of the Government on the subject : -9. &quot; The First Lord informs the Board that questions have been asked in the House of Commons whether persons serving in an established capacity in the Permanent Civil Service of the State may, at the same time, announce themselves publicly as candidates for seats in that House, and may issue political addresses and speak at political meetings in furtherance of then-election.&apos;&apos; The First Lord represents to the Board the grave importance of these questions, and that it is expedient to settle them, as re-gards the establishment of the Treasury, by an express Minute of such a general character as to regulate, without further refer-ence to the Board, whatever particular eases of the kind may arise.&apos;&apos; The First Lord expresses to the Board his own strong sense of the public injury which must be the consequence of any departure from the conditions which, under Parliamentary Government, render a Permanent Civil Service possible, and he points out that, among those conditions, the essential one is that the members of such a service should remain free to serve the Government of the day, without necessarily exposing themselves to public charges of inconsistency or insincerity.&quot;-The First Lord points out that, whatever may be the theoretical difficulty of defining the degree of reserve which these conditions impose upon Civil Servants, it has been solved in prac-tice as is proved by the rarity of charges of partisanship against members of their body, so that the Board of Treasury is called upon to refer to an unwritten, but operative law, rather than to declare a new one.&quot; My Lords find that, as a matter of fact, the usage of the Public Departments has been for a Civil Servant, seeking a seat in the House of Commons, to resign his office as soon as he issues his address to the electors, or in any other manner announces himself as a candidate.&quot; My Lords consider that this usage should be binding; and they declare it to be so in the Treasury, and in all other Depart-ments which depend upon the Treasury for the regulation of their discipline.&apos;&apos; The First Lord further states that Her Majesty&apos;s Government is agreed upon the substance of his observations to the Board, and that he proposes to cause the result of them to be embodied in an Order to be submitted to Her Majesty the Queen in Council, which, when passed, will be binding on the entire Permanent Civil Service of the State.
... &quot;In the meantime let copies of this Minute be laid before Parliament, and circulated to the Public Departments for then-information.&quot; My Lords approve.&quot;(b) Candidature for County Councils. . .10. The question of the candidature of Civil Servants for County Councils arose soon after the passing of the Local Government Act of 1888, and was determined by a reply to a question in the House of Commons on the 6th December, 1888, given by the First Lord of the Treasury on behalf of the Government, This reply- was embodied in Treasury Minute of the 18th idem and circulated to the public Departments for their information and guidance as the decision of the Government. It was to the effect that members of the Civil Service were not permitted to become candidates for County Councils because it was obvious that the discharge of duties on the County Councils might seriously conflict with their duties in the Civil Service.The matter was, however, reconsidered and in 1909 it was left to the head of each Department to determine whether, and if so upon what conditions, an officer of his Department might become a candidate for or serve on. any local Council provided that the duties involved did not conflict with the personal performance of the officers duties to his Department.(c) Candidature for other Municipal Bodies.11. Generally speaking, the decision as to candidature in these cases is left to the discretion of the department concerned, pro-vided that normally no special leave, with or without pay, is given for service when elected.We.learn, however, that exceptional privileges in this matter are enjoyed by industrial employees in the dockyards. They are given leave without pay to enable them to discharge their muni-cipal duties.(d) General Political Activities.12. While it is broadly understood that Civil Servants cannot even in their private time divest themselves of their special responsibilities and there is an unwritten but none the less general rule that they must maintain a reserve in political matters and not put themselves forward prominently on one side or the other, we could find no written regulation applicable to the whole of the Civil Service, though most of our witnesses, official and others, assumed the existence of such a rule.Obedience to this and other rules of conduct is regarded as a matter of Departmental discipline, and particular Departments have made various regulations for the guidance of their own
employees. Thus no Excise Officer may be a member of any political association, or take an active part in canvassing or serve on committees at elections of Members of Parliament. It is &quot; expected of officers of the Post Office as public servants that they shall maintain a certain reserve in political matters, and not put themselves forward on one side or the other. This is especially the case with Postmasters and Sub-postmasters whose study it should be to retain the confidence of the public and care-fully to avoid doing anything that may lend colour to the sugges-tion that in the discharge of their official duties they are influenced by political or party motives.&quot;13. The detailed regulations for the Post Office are as follows : (i) A servant of the Department may not serve on a Com-mittee having for its object to promote or prevent the return of a particular candidate to Parliament.(ii) He may not support or oppose any particular candidate or party either by public speaking or writing.(iii) A notice soliciting votes for any particular candidate may not be exhibited either within or without any Post Office or other building under the control of the Department, and within such buildings a memorial or address with a political party object may not lie for signature or be exhibited.(iv.) Postmen and other Officers of the Department are forbidden when in uniform to take part in any demonstration of a party or political character. .(v) The rules dealing with the political activities of Post Office servants are not regarded as necessarily pre-cluding them from undertaking canvassing work at election times when they are not on duty and are not in uniform. It is, however, obvious that in the case of certain of the more responsible grades active canvassing would be incompatible with their official position, and whilst the Postmaster-General prefers for the moment to leave this question to the discretion and good sense of the staff, he must reserve to himself the right to specify; certain grades the members of which could not be allowed to undertake political canvassing.(We were informed that Rule (v) is a new experiment, that the question of drawing a line had not yet arisen and that if it did the difficulties were so great that the rule might have to be with-drawn altogether.)Similar rules, not however so detailed, obtain in other large Departments.  .02992 A 5
SUMMARY   OP   EVIDENCE.14. We now proceed to summarise the evidence given to us except in so far as it was a statement of those existing rules to which reference has already been made. We found nor were we surprised that for most of our witnesses, as for ourselves, tho problem they were dealing with became more complex on closer acquaintance.The Admiralty .15. The Admiralty informed us that during the last generation there has been little desire on the part of naval officers to cbm-bine politics with their naval careers. Those officers who become candidates for Parliament generally intend to retire from the Active List if they are elected and they do actually retire.No case of a rating seeking election to Parliament had occurred prior to the 1924 Election. A mobilised pensioner became a candidate at the first General Election after the war, but was not elected.The half-pay system for officers plays a larger part in the Navy than in the other Fighting Services, and on the whole the Admiralty view is against limiting the opportunities of unem-ployed officers to find useful public occupation by preventing them from sitting in Parliament from which no statute excludes then). On the other hand, it is unlikely that the right will ever be widely used.16. Whilst, however, the Admiralty are not in favour of requir-ing officers and men adopted as candidates or elected to Parlia-ment to be removed at once from the Active List, they consider that the present regulations require amendment. The general rule being, as stated above, that an officer or rating on full pay-is not allowed to make political speeches or to undertake political activities, it is, the Admiralty feel, clearly inconsistent with this rule that he should be given unrestricted permission to do so when he happens to be a candidate at an election.The Admiralty consider, therefore, that in future officers and ratings should not be granted full-pay leave for such a purpose, and as half-pay for ratings does not exist and officers and ratings must be treated alike, their solution is that officers and ratings on the Active List (i.e., half-pay officers as well as others) should be required to obtain Admiralty permission before becoming even prospective candidates for Parliament and that they should be placed on an unemployed list without pay from that time forward, and made subject to retirement after a certain period of non-service.17. The Admiralty expressed the view that the position of the Navy and the naval officer was in striking contrast with that of the civil servant in this matter.   The duties of members of the
higher grades of the Civil Service bring them into direct contact with the political discussions of the day; they are largely engaged in advising Ministers as to the probable consequences of political measures, and as to the ways and means of putting political pro-posals into effect. If the principle is conceded that political disabilities should not be created, except in order to serve some good practical purpose, there seem in the Admiralty view to be strong reasons for treating the Navy differently from the higher grades of the Civil Service in this respect.Nevertheless the Admiralty did propose a modification in their existing practice which really would place those on active service outside the category of Parliamentary candidates. Further, the Admiralty were prepared to accept a complete assimilation of their rules to those of the Civil Service if uniformity in this matter were in the public interest considered to be desirable.The Army Council.IS. The Army Council proposed that if an officer or other rank desired to enter Parliament, he should be granted leave without pay or allowances from the statutory date of his adoption as a candidate. If he were elected he should be called upon to resign his commission or retire on retired pay (other ranks being given a free discharge) from the date of taking his seat in the House of Commons.The War Office witnesses stated, however, in this respect agreeing with the witness from the Admiralty, that there was no real objection to assimilating the Army rules to the existing Civil Service rules, if, in the public interest, uniformity was in this matter desired. These witnesses were themselves unable to explain the full reason for the existing discrepancies, but they pointed out that Army Officers could be put on half-pay and seconded to duties of varied kinds public and private, and it might have been considered that there was no sufficient reason in this respect to discriminate against the Member of Parliament. Further, the Army was not brought intimately into touch with political matters in the same way as the Civil Service. On con-sideration, however, they felt that so far as Army officers engaged on administrative duties were concerned it was difficult to&apos; make for them any claim not equally competent to a civil servant.The Air Council.19. The Air Council consider that the present rates should be amended and that officers on full-pay or half-pay and airmen should be definitely forbidden to stand as candidates for Parlia-ment.The Air Council in general consider that the position of the Royal Air Force personnel should be assimilated to that of civil servants, who, for reasons which appear to the Council to be no less applicable to combatant servants of the Crown, are placed under a special disability in this matter.   No real justification can
in the Council&apos;s judgment be found for issuing half-pay to an j officer who is serving as a Member of Parliament, especially since the system of paying members for their services has come into force; and, if officers are kept on the half-pay list, some similar concession must be made in regard to airmen. Parliamentary candidature involves almost necessarily the diversion of the candi-date&apos;s interest and attention from his service duties, which thus tend to suffer. Discipline may also be affected by conditions under which, both during candidature and after election, the fullest freedom of speech and of criticism cannot be denied to anyone who chooses to stand or is fortunate, enough to be elected. A clear separation of the military and the political careers is, in the opinion of the Air. Council, the only way to avoid difficulties which are greater to-day than they were when the present rules were made. . IThe Air Ministry were strongly of opinion that sailors, soldiers, I airmen and civil servants should all come under the same restric- I tions, but were ready to. accept any general decision on the ques- I tion of industrial staffs. - IOrganisations of -Government Civil Employees.20. The Trade Union Side of the Co-ordinating- Committee for 1Government Industrial Councils stated that the position of the Iindustrial employees of the various Government Departments 1with regard to the question of civil rights is that these men enjoy Ithe common rights of the ordinary citizen, with&quot;the sole exception Ithat they.are not allowed to become Parliamentary candidates. they   can, and do, take the fullest part in municipal and county Iaffairs without question, and without seeking permission from their superior officers.     Nominally leave without pay may be Srefused if their absence interferes with the work of the Depart- Iment, but in practice this never occurs.   The Admiralty allows gmembers of local governing bodies to have special leave without Ipay each year in excess of the ordinary amount of leave without Ipay- -    . &apos;,.    1The industrial employees of the Admiralty too take a prominent I part in political life as occasion demands.   They act as agents to   i$ Parliamentary candidates, speak from political platforms, etc.,   I with the full Knowledge and consent of their superior officers.The witnesses dwelt upon the resulting anomalies of the exist-   J ing position.   An industrial dockyard worker may speak from a   1 political-jplatform ;  a postman may not.   An Army officer may   1 become a Parliamentary candidate ; an Inland Revenue clerk ma\ not canvass for votes.   An industrial dockyard employee of the Admiralty may act as election agent, and placard the constituency with his name and address, but a postal and telegraph clerk is   1 not allowed to sit upon a political platform.21&apos;. The claim is that all Civil Servants, whatever their rant&apos;. should.be allowed to exercise full civil rights. In the witnesses&apos; opinion the contention that no one paid with money voted by : I
Parliament should- be allowed to stand for Parliament is, in the light of modern developments, far-fetched and out of date. Its natural corollary that no Government employee should actively support the candidature of any seeker after Parliamentary honours has they suggested already gone by the board with regard to a very large number of employees. The numbers of the civil ser-vice are so great, the number of possible&apos; candidates is so small, that to&apos; concede to all the full exercise of the ordinary civil rights of the tax and ratepayer would not be a far-reaching concession. Speaking with special reference to the dockyard workmen, they pointed out that these were in- a different position from ordinary civil servants in that the vast majority were weekly paid servants with approximately only one in eight* eligible for a pension. There was to all intents and purposes no difference between their status and that of persons employed in private dockyards..22. At this stage we should explain that we received two separate written statements from this organisation, one making the above claim on behalf of all Civil Servants and the other claim-ing that in this matter dockyard workmen should be free from the restrictions of Civil Servants generally. In this latter statement it was explained that until it was so announced in 1920 these employees had not been regarded as &quot; Civil Servants &quot; from the point of view of Parliamentary candidature: It was accordingly proposed in this statement that any employee who is accepted as a Parliamentary- candidate should resign from the Service when he issues his address. If unsuccessful he should after the election, upon application to the Superintendent of the Dockyard in which he was formerly employed, be reinstated with his previous seniority, etc., but the interval between resignation and re-em-ployment should not count for bonus, pension or other privileges. If a candidate was successful his resignation should stand. It was admittedly undesirable that a Member of Parliament should go backward and forward to- work under a Government Depart-ment. The witnesses fully agreed that if Departmental promoting-tion came to be based on political service it would be an evil and quoted with approval the dockyard axiom that if a claim to pro-motion had to be backed by political influence it was because it was poor on merits.23. The Civil Service Joint Committee explained to us that they represented all the staff organisations affiliated to the staff side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council. They handed in a very full and reasoned statement which after summarising the existing restrictions stated that Civil Servants claim the full rights of citizenship particularised as follows :  (a) Civil Servants in general should in future be under no disability in regard to the public expression of their political opinions, except in so far as restrictions are imposed upon all by the Official Secrets Acts, 1911 and 1920.* We ave informed that the correct figure is over 1 in 4. .
(b) Civil Servants should not be prevented by Official regu-lations from standing as candidates for election to the House of Commons.(c) Civil Servants who become Parliamentary &quot;candidatesshould be granted special leave for a period not exeeed-ing one month on the occasion of any General Election or bye-election at which they are candidates.(d) Civil Servants provisionally adopted as Parliamentarycandidates should be granted special leave not exceed-ing one month per annum for political work in their prospective constituencies.(e) Civil Servants elected to the House of Commons shouldbe granted special leave during the period of their membership.(/) Civil Servants elected to local government bodies should be granted special leave not exceeding 21 days per annum for the purpose of the business of the bodies to which they are elected. . . (g) Special leave granted under Clauses (c), (d), (e) and (/) should not be reckoned for the purposes of pay, incre-ment, or pension but should not be regarded as break-ing continuity of service. At the expiration of any such period of special leave, the Civil Servant con-cerned should have the right to resume duty in the grade and at the salary point which he held at the commencement of the period of special leave.24. These witnesses expressed the view that the existing restrictions on Civil Servants were unnecessary; that Civil Servants were entitled and indeed in duty bound to take as keen an interest and as controversial a part in partisan politics as any other citizen.They added that while it was impossible for Civil Servants not to hold and be influenced by political views which were often at direct variance with the policy they were administering, this did not impair their loyalty in administering that policy, and that in place of the existing restriction on the expression of those views ali that was required was a code of pro-fessional discretion such as that expected of barristers and solicitors. The safeguard against illegitimate use of Departmental information lay in the Official Secrets Acts, but still more in the professional ethic which would impress on the individual the undesirability of taking public action which might prejudice his professional work.25. They alluded to the invidious distinction at present drawn between Civil Servants and members of the Fighting Services: to the grant of leave without pay to London County Council staff, teachers, officers and employees who were candidates at the General Election of 1923 and to a similar concession allowed to two railway employees who were successful at that election.
They added that the exclusion of Civil Servants from the &apos;&apos; full expression of citizenship &quot; has in their opinion, deprived the political life of the nation, of a body of experience and knowledge which has become increasingly important of recent years and they drew attention to the large numbers, now over 300,000, of State employees (apart from naval and military forces).26. They added that it would be desirable to consider certain limitations as regards particular types of civil servants, e.g.y Inspectors of Taxes. Further, it would be unreasonable for officers responsible for the formulation of policy to be taking part in a political controversy centring round their own particular official duties. The exact line of demarcation they agreed was not easy to draw, but it was suggested that, for example, officers in administrative, directing and controlling grades on salaries above (say)  700 a year basic might be required to obtain the specific permission of the Head of the Department before taking any public part in political work. Such permission should not, however, be unreasonably withheld, and some form of appeal should be provided. The onus of proof should lie on those who wished to impose the limitation. These cases excepted, the claim was for all grades, pensionable and unpensionable, adminis-trative, manipulative and industrial.27. The only Civil Service evidence tendered to us was that on behalf of the Staff Federations. We ascertained that the representative&apos; organisations of Women Civil Servants did not desire to give separate evidence. But we were led to&apos; assume that if such evidence had been given it would.have been to the same effect as that just summarised. No Civil Servants as individuals gave evidence.. We believe, however, that the views placed before us on the part of the Departments and summarised below are largely held throughout.the Service, more particularly in the higher grades.Representatives of Civil Departments.28. Representatives of the General Post Office and the Ministry of Pensions, founding upon their experience of the administra-tion of large public Departments coming into close touch with the public, gave us their views as to the results which might be expected to follow the acceptance of the principles enunciated by the Civil Service Joint Committee, and Sir Warren Fisher told us how not only as representing the Treasury but as the per-manent Head of the Civil Service the questions at issue presented themselves to his mind.29. The special case of Industrial Government employees was brought forward as a separate matter by the Admiralty and War Office representatives. The Admiralty representative gave reasons for exempting dockyard workmen and other industrial Government employees from rules applicable to Civil Servants generally. He considered that the existing rule which requires resignation of employment, not on election to^ Parliament, but on
becoming a candidate for Parliament, was unnecessarily strin-gent for those grades. He would draw the line in this matter not between established (pensionable) and unestablished (unpen-sionable) staff but between &quot; wages &quot; staff and &quot; salaried &quot; staff or officers.. The &quot;War Office representative inclined to the view that unlike the permanent Civil Servant the unpensionable industrial em-ployee had received no privilege which justified withholding any of his political rights, but he strongly deprecated any departure from existing&quot; rules as regards the permanent Civil Service.We may here observe that in the War Office practically all industrial employees are unpensioriable, the exception being a few men in supervisory positions. The distinction between pen-sionable and unpensionable has accordingly no place there so far as industrials are concerned. The Post Office representative thought such a distinction impracticable. .30. The activities of the Post Office are familiar to all, but those of the Ministry of Pensions are less well known. It is the duty of that Ministry to administer Acts of Parliament and Royal Warrants and be in direct touch with 2,000,000 persons to whom payments of varying amounts are made. Its representative pointed out that both in the settlement of general policy and in the carrying out of detailed administration the direct issue is the expenditure of more or less public money in payments to this or that class of beneficiary or to this or that individual beneficiary. Inl his view the political impartiality of all Ministry employees is really essential. This impartiality, he was satisfied, was required from subordinate local officials, whose work brought them daily into contact with actual or would-be beneficiaries, at least as much as from the higher administrative ranks. A difficult posi-tion would arise if an officer enquiring into the family circum-stances of applicants for &apos;&apos; need &apos;&apos; pensions knew that he was or would be dependent on or be assisted by the votes of the people into whose circumstances he was enquiring.OVERSEAS PRACTICE.31. We have obtained a good deal of information as to the practice of foreign governments and of the Dominions, and in particular as to the reasons which led to the stringent rules which have in recent years been adopted in Canada to^ circum-scribe the exercise by Government, employees of influence in politics.   This information is summarised below.Australia.32. Under Section 44 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, 3918-1922, any person who  (iv) Holds any office of profit under the Crown or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of the revenues of the Commonwealth-
shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a Senator or a member of the House of Representatives.The sub-section does not apply to the office of any of the Ministers of State for the Commonwealth or of any of the Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half-pay, or a pension by any person as an officer or member of the Imperial navy or army, or to&apos; the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth.New South Wales.33. In 1916 by the New South Wales Constitution Amend-ment Act permission was given to public servants to contest parliamentary elections without first resigning them positions. Upon the working of that measure we have been furnished by Mr. Bland, Lecturer in, Public Administration at Sydney University, with a most interesting memorandum to the whole of which we invite Your Lordships&apos; attention. It indicates as well the conditions under which the concession of such a privilege may be innocuous a,s the possibilities to which it may give rise, e.g., that of an officer contesting an election in opposition to his minister and being necessarily transferred from his position in the service after being rejected by the electorate. It points out that the last Ptoyal Commission upon the Public Service of New South Wales recommended the repeal of the Statute of 1916, and that, while on the one hand the Government has not carried out that recommendation, yet on the other hand no attempt has been made by any Commonwealth Government to introduce a Federal Statute to the like effect.34. We may perhaps set forth textually two paragraphs from Mr. Bland&apos;s memorandum, one in which he deals with the question more generally, the other with which he concludes : (a) &quot; It is a moot point to what extent, if at all, a Public Servant should be called upon to renounce his ordi-nary civil rights when he receives an appointment under the Crown. In New South Wales, Govern-ment activities engage the energies of a considerable percentage of adult members of the community, and if there were a marked extension of such activities with a proportionate addition to the number of Public Servants, it would become absurd to preclude them from participating in the formula-tion of political policies. That stage, in my judgment, has not yet been reached. Nevertheless, if it be true that the Pablic Service comprises men and women who have been carefully selected from thousands of applicants for employment, it is surely against the best interests of the State to prohibit their engaging in political activities.&quot;
(6) &quot; Summing up it may be said that up to the present the concessions granted in this State have not been attended by any serious results in the effective administration of the Government Departments. But that is due to two facts, (1) the strong tradition which has grown up insisting upon the integrity and effi-ciency of the Public Service, and (2) that the officials who have so far engaged in Parliamentary contests have had little influence in the Service. All the more important public officials are independent of party politics and I am merely voicing the sentiments of the most thoughtful when I say that it is believed that the less public servants engage as protagonists in the various parties, the better it will be for the tradition of the Public Service and for the efficient administra-tion of Governmental affairs.&quot;Canada.35. The Civil Service Act of 1918 (consolidating the Civil Ser-vice Act of 1908) by section 32 provides : (1) &quot; No deputy head, officer, clerk or employee in the Civil Service shall be debarred from voting at any Dominion or provincial election if, under the laws governing the said election, he has the right to vote; but no such deputy head, officer, clerk or employee shall engage in partisan work in connection with any such election, or contribute, receive or any way deal with any money for any party funds.(2) Any person violating any of the provisions of this section shall be dismissed from the Civil Service.&quot;36. The Dominions Election Act, 1920, provides as follows in -Section 39 :-&quot; (i) The respective persons hereunder mentioned shall not for the time specified as to each such person be eligible as candidates at an election, namely :  ***** *(/) Every person accepting or holding any office, commission or employment, permanent or temporary, in the service of the Government of Canada at the nomination of the Crown or at the nomination of any of the officers of the Government of Canada, to which any salary, fee, wages, allowance, emolument or profit of any kind is attached during the time he is so holding any&apos; such office, commission or employment.(Ministers of the Crown  are exempted from the foregoing).
37. We were fortunate in having the Canadian attitude with reference to this question, now embodied in the above legislation, explained to us by two eminent Canadian Statesmen who happened to be in London last summer. These were the Hon. Newton Wesley Bo well, K.C., and the Hon. B,. B. Bennett, K.C. Mr. Bow&quot;ell was President of the Council and Vice-Chairman of the War Committee of the Canadian Coalition Cabinet from 1917 to 1920, and the deliberations of a Committee of the Cabinet of which he was a member resulted in the passage of the Civil Ser-vice Act of 1918. Mr. Bennett, a member of the Legislature of Alberta for some years, became later a member of the Dominion Parliament and was Minister of Justice during the year 1921. The knowledge of the subject as it affects Canada possessed by both witnesses was accordingly exceptionally intimate. They stated the same conclusions in different language. These statutes, in Mr. Powell&apos;s view, had been called for by progres-sive opinion in Canada desirous of modelling the Canadian Civil Service on the non-partisan impartial Civil Service which existed in the United Kingdom. Canada was anxious toi escape from and avoid the grave difficulties and disabilities which, as they saw them, arose from the application of the Spoils System to the Civil Service. The main purpose of the Canadian Civil Service reforms in Mr. bennett&apos;s view was to remove from the Civil Servant any feeling that he owed allegiance to any particular party as distinct from the State itself. To his mind there was no doubt that the reforms had effected a great improvement in the efficiency of the Canadian Service. The prohibitions of the statutes were without exceptions. They applied to every grade of Civil Servant.Every one must resign from the Public Service before he could become a Parliamentary candidate ; nor would there in Canada be any question of his being re-instated or re-engaged in the event of defeat. No such demand was made there even by the Civil Service Associations who offered resolute opposition to any return to the patronage system. Questioned as to the Dominion Indus-trial Employees, Mr. Bennett replied that there were no such employees of precisely the same type as the Dockyard Employees here. The letter carrier, however, who was analogous to the English postman would certainly, he said, be dismissed if he took part in an election even to the extent of sitting on a Committee. It was an unthinkable position for a candidate who had been de-feated in an election to resume his Civil Service appointment.38. We have set forth these views at this length not because they are necessarily applicable to the situation in this country, but because they illustrate the length to which even progressive opinion will go in this matter in order to avoid so much as the possibility of return to a system from which this country has so long been free that its evils are, in many quarters, now hardly appreciated.
39. These Canadian rules are not in fact applicable to the employees of the State Railways, for these are not &quot; Civil Servants.&quot; The views of the Dominion Government with regard to the participation of Canadian National Railway employees in political contests are set forth in a still recent letter from the Premier, the Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, in reply to a request from Mr. W. D. Bayley, member elect of the Manitoba legislature, for the re-instatement in the Cana-dian National Railways of two defeated Labour candidates in the Manitoba elections previously employees of the Railways. The letter of the Premier was in part as follows : &quot; The control of the Canadian National Railways is vested in a board of directors which is held responsible by the Government as representing the people for the management and operation of the roads. It is a fundamental principle of government policy not to interfere, or to permit inter-ference, with the board of directors in the discharge of its duties. The Government is therefore not in a position to say to the board of directors what in this, or in any other matter, should or should not be done. On the other hand, the Government does not hesitate to make known that atti-tude which in its opinion should be adopted by the board of directors of the government railways with respect to the right of railroad workers to offer themselves for political office. As regards workers&apos; on the Government railroads, the Government would hope and expect that the&apos; same attitude be taken in the matter of their political rights as is taken towards their employees by the privately-owned railroads.&quot;South Africa.Extract from the Union Public Service Regulations.40. &quot; 3. In the event of an officer or employee accepting a nomination or requisition as a candidate for election as a member of the Union Parliament or of any Provincial Council or of any Borough, Municipal or Divisional Council he shall be deemed to have voluntarily resigned from&apos;the Public Service.The Minister may, however, grant permission&apos;to an officer or. employee .to accept nomination for election and. to serve on a village management board, health committee, school, board, local board, or any other minor body if he is satisfied after enquiry that such officer&apos;s duties as a member of the Public Service will not thereby in any way be interfered with; provided that, in the event of any question arising between the Union Government or any Provincial Administration, and any such board or committee, any officer who may have been permitted to become a member thereof shall take no part in the discussion or give any vote on any such question.&quot;
The Public Service and Pensions Act of 1923 provides that any officer in the public service who becomes a member of any political organisation or takes an active part in political matters or attempts to secure intervention from political or outside sources in relation to his position, promotion, transfer or emolu-ments, in the public service, shall be deemed to have been guilty of misconduct (punishable by caution, reprimand, fine or sus-pension).Extract from the South African Railways and Harbours StaffRegulations.41. &quot; (&apos;2) Any servant who desires to seek election to the Union Parliament or to a Provincial Council is free to do so. Any servant accepting nomination will be allowed such leave without pay as may be necessary in connection with his candidature subsequent to the date of nomination. If unsuccessful in his candidature he may resume duty without break in his service, the period of absence being treated as ordinary leave without pay. If successful in his candidature, a servant will be regarded as resigning from the service from the date of his election.&apos;&apos; (3) Any servant may be granted permission to accept nomina-tion for election to serve on a municipal council, village mariage-ment board, health committee, hospital board, school board, local board, or other minor body if the Administration is satisfied after inquiry that such servant&apos;s duties as a member of the Railways and Harbours Service will not thereby be interefered with ; pro-vided that in the event of any question arising between the Union Government or any Provincial Administration or the Railways and Harbours Administration and any such board or committee, any servant who may have been permitted to become a member thereof shall take no part in the discussion or give any vote on any such question. Subject to the exigencies of the service, such leave of absence without pay as may be necessary in these cases will be allowed both for the purposes of the election and to allow elected members to attend meetings of the council, board, or committee, as the case may be.(4) A servant may not sign a requisition for candidates to stand for election to the Union Parliament or to a Provincial Council nor may he, except under the conditions provided for in paragraph (2) of this regulation, take an open or active part in electioneering either by public speaking or writing, or serve on a- committee having for its object the promotion of, or prevention of, the return of any particular candidate to Parliament or a Provincial Council.&quot;Fbance and Germany.42. We are greatly indebted to Dr. Herman Finer for a great deal of information and in particular for the following statement in regard to France and Germany.
&quot;. France. Civil Servants enjoy the whole range of political rights common to all citizens. They are electors and are eligible for election. There are, however, several restrictions affecting local governments.Local Government law stipulates that the following officials are not eligible in the place in which they habitually work (a) Prefects,   sub-prefects,   general  secretaries   (to theseofficials) and prefectoral councillors.(b) Commissioners of police and constables.(c) Magistrates of the courts of appeal and first instance.(d) Justices of the peace.(e) Accountants in the municipal financial service. (/) School teachers in public service.(g) Employees in the administrative offices directly employedby the prefect and sub-prefect.(h) Engineers and supervisors of the road and bridge serviceof the urban and local system. Generally, officials can participate in political organisations. They are altogether unmolested if they work with political organisations supporting the government of the day. Erequent circulars, from the Ministers and high officials, seek to lay down rules controlling the political action of the rank and file. Where officials are hostile to) the Government, they are submitted to all sorts of annoyance; their residence is changed, or disciplinary action is taken against them on some pretext.&quot; When an official is elected in local Government (outside Paris) he exercises his legislative mandate while continuing his service; the local assembly meets rarely. When an official is elected Senator or Deputy he obtains of right the capacity to be placed in the position of &apos; detachment.&apos; That is to say, by an order of the Minister of Finance he continues to count as regards status in his department and preserves the right to promotion and pension, but receives no pay. Detachment can be granted for a first period of 5 years, repeatable. Thus if the official loses his mandate at the following elections he only has to request re-integration into his department. These measures are recent, dating only from 1919.&quot; It is apparently the constant practice of the Cabinet, when an election approaches, to order that officials standing for Parliament should be put on leave without pay. But this is not based on any legal rule, and is merely a bogey without substance. Such orders have previously been annulled, at the instance of the persons immediately concerned, by the Conseil d&apos;Etat. The doctrine of this court is (judgments of 11th May and 9th August. 1918) as follows: The orders are illegal &apos; Considering that the mere fact of an official presenting himself as candidate at the legislative elections could not, in the absence of any legal rule to that effect and made in conformity with regulations by the competent authority, cause his being put on leave without pay for the duration of the electoral period-; that it belongs only to the
department to see that the agent, if he himself does not ask for leave, continues to acquit his official duties correctly and com -pletely as in normal time and to take against him., when necessary, where he fails to fulfil his obligations, the disciplinary action prescribed by law.&apos;&quot; Up to 1852 there was a general tradition and practice of officials being members of the Chamber and the Senate, until it became a great abuse, both from the administrative and the political standpoints. From 1852 dates the constitutional principle that every paid public office is incompatible with the mandate of deputy to the legislative body. In 1875 this general rule was adopted, but a list of exceptions made the ordinary civil servants&apos; situation compatible with eligibility, but it was not until 1919 that the above mentioned measures made this compatibility effective by providing for re-integration into the service.&quot;43. Germany. For Federal and State Authorities Article 39 of the Constitutions of 1919 says &apos; Civil Servants and members of the armed forces do not require special leave for the exercise of their office as members of the Reichstag or of a Landtag. If they become candidates for a seat in these bodies they shall be granted the leave necessary to prepare for the election.&apos;&apos;&apos; The old constitution also permitted Civil Servants entry into these bodies without leave. And then, as now, the Civil Servant continued to draw his pay. But the second part of the clause embodies a new principle. Under the old constitution the grant of time to prepare for the election was a question left to the head of the department. The first two projects of the new constitution granted a &apos; proper &apos; period of leave; in the sense of &apos; adequate &apos; to carrying out necessary electoral plans. This word was struck out altogether by the Constitutional Committee of the Gon-stituent Assembly; and this clause might probably have been taken to mean that henceforth there existed a right to leave, limited only by the discretion of the candidate. A last attempt to limit the construction of &apos; leave &apos; was made at the third reading of the clause when the qualification &apos; necessary &apos; was introduced. This was in order to secure to the leave-granting authority the power to limit the period of leave to what was, in its opinion, strictly necessary, and no more, to the purpose in view. On one side the extreme Socialists said that this limita-tion did away with any new privilege: on the other side, more Conservative politicians wanted this part of the clause omitted altogether.&quot;Dr. Finer further informed us that the German Reichstag of 450 members then contained 75 serving Civil Servants.GENERAL VIEWS.44. The result in his case of closer study of the question is shown by the views submitted to us by one who had previously strongly pressed the claim now put forward by the Civil Service Joint Committee.     His proposal was that while manipulative
staffs like Postmen should be given full civil rights, these should be withheld from staffs oj all grades of. &quot; &quot;Whitehall &quot; offices, including all clerks engaged on Health or Unemployment In-surance work. In his view the fact that these had recourse to confidential official information was decisive and the governing principle should be that anyone who was a direct instrument of the politically chosen executive should not enter into political controversy.45. Another witness favourable in general to the claim would go a long way towards removing all political disabilities, but would propose a number of consequential changes and restrictions to balance the account. He would not treat Parliamentary candidature as a question apart, but would create a series of precedents to determine what sort of alternative career justified permanent seconding and what was taken at a Civil Servant!s own risk. He would thus radically alter the whole Civil Service pension system which is based on continuous service up to the normal retiring age. He added that the question of the danger of the political influence of Civil Servants and the best method of countering it without imposing unwarrantable restrictions was world-wide and required long and detailed examination by a Royal Commission with the fullest powers of investigation.CONCLUSIONS.46. We now proceed to indicate the conclusions we have our-selves reached on the subject of our Reference. We have reached them after as full a study as has been possible of the whole problem and after careful consideration of the information and evidence we have collected.47. At the outset we would refer again to our terms of reference.Our comimission under these is to inquire into the existing regulations governing the candidature for Parliament and for Municipal Bodies of persons in the service of the Crown. &apos; We are not, it will be noted, directed to inquire into the regulations governing the exercise by such persons of any other political activities and we cannot doubt that it was not intended that we should inquire into these. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, as already pointed out, had at least so far as the established Civil Service is concerned definitely expressed in Pariament his own views upon&apos; this, as a general question, reserving for further consideration only the narrower issue. Moreover the MacDonnell Commission on the Civil Service had so recently as 1914 made a unanimous deliverance on the subject, and, so far at all events as the higher grades were concerned, in the same sense as the Chancellor48. One consequence of this is that the area of recommendation is very materially circumscribed. We find ourselves to be in agreement with practically all our witnesses in the belief that
wherever the right to stand for Parliament without remission of State Employment is conceded the claim to exercise a wide measure of &quot; Civil Eights &quot; must logically be conceded also. If a State employee of any grade is to be permitted to stand for Parliament and if the concession is to be of value to him he must also be at liberty, if he is not to be unduly handicapped in the contest, to expound his views beforehand both in writing and by speech. Moreover the concession must be given to all of his grade irrespective of any candidature actual or prospective. This view is taken both by those who as part of their wider claim demand for State employees the right to stand for and be elected to Parliament arid by those who contest even this narrower claim. They all say that acceptance of the narrower claim leads necessarily to the concession of the wider and we are constrained to agree.49. It does not follow however that our inquiry, even if we understand its implication aright, is thereby at once concluded, for the converse of this last proposition is by no means true.Even if it were hereafter considered desirable to relax in certain directions the existing restrictions upon the political activities of all or of certain grades of Crown servants, it may weil be that liberty to stand for or be elected to Parliament might at least in certain cases be&apos;outside the privileges which in the interests of the Service could be properly conceded Candidature for Parlia-ment may involve demands both actual and prospective on official time and may have a prejudicial effect on the quality of official work. In the language of another sphere of activity, there is a middle course between forbidding Crown servants to play cricket and extending to them the necessary facilities to become full-time members of county elevens or even, to undertake Australian tours. The question from the point of view of the State becomes not one of &quot; civil rights &quot; but one of administrative efficiency and we will so consider it in what follows.50. A word only, before we&apos;do so, on this broader question of &quot; political rights.&quot;     &quot;&apos;. &apos;       &apos;   :   &apos;Although we have felt ourselves debarred from making any-detailed inquiry into this matter, our witnesses have not refrained from discussing it and we have not been able entirely to exclude it from our minds. We would say this with reference to it. There is we know even amongst ourselves divergence of view as to the limit of grade within which the existing restriction on the exercise of political activity may safely be relaxed. Some of us-impressed by the necessity of maintaining without possibility of question the public confidence in the political impartiality of the Public Service, recognising at the same time that the permanence of tenure, regular leave, superannuation benefits and so forth, which the public servant enjoys may justify iri the public interest restrictions not imposed upon those who do not possess like privi-leges, and led also by existing experience to the conclusion that in an organisation so complex any partial concessions might
create more anomalies and a greater and more justifiable sense of grievance than a uniform restriction some of us would scrutinize narrowly any proposed relaxation. Others of us, moved by the advantage to the State of removing a sense of grievance repeatedly expressed and by the harmfulness of retain-ing inhibitions not clearly justified on the merits of the case, would scrutinize with equal narrowness every restriction in this matter. But we are all satisfied that in the ranks of the public service to which the restriction is properly applicable, and every-one of us would at least include in these ranks all grades directly connected with Departmental administration, the strict obser-vance of existing restrictions on political activity is quite essential. The conclusions of the MacDonriell Commission in this matter are remarkably confirmed by the Canadian experience to which we have referred, while the very qualified results of the experi-ment in the other direction made in New South Wales are instruc-tive also. The constantly extending disposition of Parliament to entrust the exercise of quasi-judicial duties to executive depart-ments without providing any of the established safeguards opera-tive against judicial excess such as publicity, right of audience to parties affected, statement of reasons for judgment, right of appeal and the like as well as the sharper alignment of political parties in these days, unite to make the high reputation for political impartiality hitherto enjoyed by the public service a more valuable national possession than ever before. We can feel no doubt that the confidence universally held in the existence of such impartiality is a most valuable guarantee for its continuance, and we can have no assurance that the existing ethic of the service would long survive that confidence if it were once lost.51. Returning now to the question of political candidature with which in this Report we are directly concerned we are first of all of opinion that unless some clear line of demarcation can be drawn differentiating in favour of particular grades or branches in the service of the Crown it is practically inevitable that if this privi-lege is extended to some it must ultimately be conceded to all. A sense of propriety ought of course to impose reserve upon highly placed officers in such a matter. But no definite exclusion of any from a privilege enjoyed generally would appear to be practicable. The privileged position in this matter hitherto enjoyed by the fighting services has become, and we think very naturally, an offence to the other branches of the Public Service. No such differentiation should, in our opinion, continue; no new differen-negotiation unless it can be justified as above and to this subject we will revert later should take its place.52. But this conclusion carries with it certain practical diffi-culties owing to the operative Statute law upon the subject. Strangely enough it seems to have been taken for granted by those who make the present claim that the existing restriction upon the Parliamentary candidature of Civil Servants rests not in detail only but in principle also upon the Order in Council of
the 10th of January, 1910, above set out. It has been assumed that the withdrawal of that Order would leave it open to all Civil Servants to stand for and be elected to Parliament without resignation of their posts. The contrary, however, as we have pointed out is the case. Very many Civil Servants are by statute disqualified from being elected to the House of Commons. It is most certainly true that substantial acceptance of the claim made by the Joint Committee would have to be preceded by the removal of many existing statutory disqualifications. In other words, we are in this matter no longer in the region of administration. Parliament alone can remove disabilities which it has itself imposed and we venture to express our own views upon the general question only because of the consideration we have given to the subject.53. And in doing so we desire first of all fully to reserve the question whether the restrictions may not properly and justifiably be removed from certain specified grades of the service. On this question there is room for and there is held, as the summary of the evidence taken by us shows, great diversity of opinion. We reserve it. With that reservation our conclusion, treating the question solely as a practical one, is that no sufficient justification for the concession generally of the privileges claimed has been shown, while from an administrative point of view alone there are weighty considerations against it being made.54. First of all, subject always to the above reservation, the concession of this privilege would we cannot doubt be calculated to have a prejudicial effect upon efficiency generally.Hitherto the regulations of the established Civil Service have been framed so that it is to the interest of those who enter that Service to make of it their life&apos;s career. Pensions and conditions of service are all adjusted to this end and efficiency seems clearly to require that it should as completely as possible be achieved. Every Civil Servant of course remains free to adopt politics or any other pursuit as a substituted career if he wants to. But, if he does, he leaves the Service, forfeiting incidentally any pension rights. The present demand on the part of the Joint Committee if conceded would enable him to make of politics an alternative career. Now from one point of view such a con-cession would administratively appear to be of little moment. Quite probably it would directly affect only a few. These however would ordinarily be diverted from the service of the State just at the time when as a result of mature official experience their work should be of especial value : while the prospect of politics as an alternative career might- be for many who could never succeed in entering Parliament a serious distraction from their official work.55. Nor does it appear that the public servant is, at present, in this matter less fortunate than most of his neighbours.   The
necessity of choosing between two careers is not a burden which falls upon him. specially. He shares it with the Doctor, the Bank Clerk, those in the service of the great commercial institutions and many others. The employees of the London County Council as will have been seen were referred to in evidence as being in a favoured position in this respect. Here too there has we think been some misapprehension. Section 83 (13) of the Local Government Act 1888 enacts that &quot; no paid clerk or other paid official in the permanent em.ployment of a County Council who is required to devote hiswhole time to such employment, shall be eligible to serve inParliament.&quot;In this connection also it may be not inapposite to refer to Section 12 (l)a of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882 which as applied by Section 75 of the Local Government Act 1888 enacts that a person is disqualified from being a County Councillor, if and while he holds any office or place of profit in the gift or disposal of the Council. And the close analogy traceable between Parliament and State employees will not. be missed.56. Perhaps however (subject again to the&apos;same reservation as before) the strongest objection administratively to the grant of special facilities to enable Civil Servants generally to become Parliamentary candidates is that the step from the Civil Servant politician to the Politicalised Civil Servce is but a short one. If a Civil Servant is to retain his position as such while standing for and even (in the extreme claim) after election to Parliament, we at once have a precedent for the politicalisation of entry to the Service, and still worse for the politicalisation of internal discipline and promotion.To put this in another way. It is most important, as the MacDonnell Commissioners pointed out, that a public servant should not use his official position to help on his political career; but it is (from the point of view of the Service) more important still that he should not even be liable to the suspicion of using his political career to affect his official position. And a man who hovered between the Civil Service and the legislature, would be a very embarrassing Civil Servant.57. The Joint Committee admitted in evidence that if tied to a rigid and logical comparison with outside employment, it was doubtful if they could make their case in regard to Parliamentary candidature for the simple reason that there is no employment analogous to the Civil Service.POSSIBILITY OF EXCEPTIONS.58. Here we have considered very carefully whether it is right to maintain the existing liberty in this particular for the fighting services and we have reached the conclusion that the differentia-tion is in itself a cause of offence and while we are far from
suggesting that the privilege has in the past as a general rule been unreasonably taken advantage of we think that there are no sufficient reasons adduced to justify its continuance. It is however right to point out&apos; that in this matter officers and men of these services, unlike so many other Crown Servants, are under no statutory disqualification.In connection with this differentiation one incident of the 1923 election was the occasion of much adverse comment. At that election a high Army officer who was engaged on administrative work and was really on merits in the same position as the administrative Civil Servant was under Army rules allowed to stand for Parliament while on active service and to resume on defeat as though nothing had happened, whereas a Dockyard employee who also stood had to resign his post. The anomaly was so great that as an act of grace the dockyard workman was&apos; reinstated, without prejudice to the general rule.Having reached the above conclusion ourselves it is to us a satisfaction to find that as above stated each representative of the service Departments called before us stated that there would in their opinion be no serious objection by the Forces to the withdrawal of existing privileges if, in the general interest, it was considered to be desirable that they should be withdrawn.59. We have also &quot;considered whether it is not possible to draw a line within the State Civil Service up to which the privilege of standing for Parliament without remission of employment should be allowed.Various suggestions have been made.One who was&apos; most anxious to extend the civil rights of postmen was (as we have shown) clear that the existing restrictions must apply to every grade of employee in every office of the &quot; White-hall &quot;type.Another suggestion was the distinction between permanent and temporary. This we do not think possible. It is a classifica-tion that does not necessarily represent any distinction of function. For example, of a-Ministry of Pensions staff of 18,000, 16,000 are temporary; the sub-postmaster is a temporary .and part-time employee, but the objections to his politicalisation are of. the strongest; and further.the. temporary employee is often, qualify-ing for permanency and is engaged on the same. duties as the permanent employee. - - . - -,60. We have also considered whether in this matter of Parlia-mentary candidature discrimination is possible and desirable on grounds of function. The Civil Service is an aggregation of persons differing widely in the nature and importance of their employment, front Permanent Secretaries to Dockyard Labourers. According to figures which have been furnished to us the Civil
Service (excluding industrials) was classified as follows in April 1923 :-(a) Administrative Group    ...      ...      ...      ... 1,596(b) Professional, Scientific and Technical Group 12,509 (c.) Inspectorate        ...       ...      ...       ...      ... 12,434(d) Executive and Clerical.Group......... 78,504*(e) &quot;Writing Assistants and Typing Grades ... 11,198* (/) Manipulative Grades (of whom 159,429 are inthe Post Office)        ............ 168,508(g) Messengers, Charwomen, etc. ...       ...      ... 19,678304,42761. Many of the persons here classified are evidently not engaged on such work as the phrase &apos;&apos; civil servant &apos;&apos; suggests to the mind of the ordinary man, and in the view of one even of the official witnesses, it is only to a small fraction of the whole Civil Service that the reasons for disqualification stated in the Treasury Minute of 1884 apply. This witness suggested that the bar had been laid down when the Civil Service was &apos;1 different from what it is now; it had consisted of quite small bodies of persons advising Ministers.&quot; This distinction was recognised also in.the Majority Report of the MacDonnell Commission. Dealing it is true, with political activities generally, without any special refer-ence to Parliamentary candidature, the Commissioners, after recommending that restrictions should be placed upon the political activities of the General and Professional Service, con-tinued (Section 14) : &quot; But it has been strongly urged upon us that the same strict rules of reserve and reticence are not neces-sary or desirable in connection with the large numbers who con-stitute the Subordinate Civil Service, and such officials as man the manipulative and distributing agencies in the Post Office and similar classes elsewhere.&quot; We think there is some force in this contention, for obviously these, latter classes do not possess and cannot acquire the same opportunities of influencing public opinion as exist in the higher ranks of the Service. Having given the matter our careful atten-tion, we consider that for the subordinate classes of public servants it will suffice if a rule be enforced prohibiting them from using their official position in any way to influence elections whether for Parliament or for local bodies.&quot;62. With the principle of this distinction some of us agree, so far as candidature for Parliament is concerned. Some of us do not believe that the grant of this concession to the two last groups (/ and g) classified above, would involve any of the danger to the public service which they agree would be likely to follow its grant to higher grades. They recognise that, as several witnesses admitted, political interests and partisanships are not even now kept out of the Service particularly the lower * Includes temporary Clerical and Typing Staff of 41,885.
grades by the existing restrictions, and that such activities as political canvassing cannot, in fact, be prevented by regulations. They think that, speaking generally, a member of one of the groups above mentioned, who wishes to stand for Parliament, should be permitted to do so, it being understood that, if elected, he or she must resign from the Service with loss of pension rights (as the pension system now stands) and without expecta-tion of reinstatement.63. This general permission must, however, they recognise, be subject to reservation. For example, no political work should be done in uniform; if his official duties bring a public servant into direct contact with the public the area of his Parliamentary candidature should not be the same as that in which his official duties are performed; and finally, no system of indefinite or prolonged leave for political purposes even without pay should be permitted the period of leave should be only as from the statutory date at which his candidature begins with possibly a week for him to interview a nominating Committee.64. They consider that it should be left to an interdepart-mental committee to decide what persons should be regarded as belonging to the groups mentioned, and that the same authority should have power to except from the concession, on grounds of public interest, particular grades within these groups, as, for instance, sub-postmasters.For the reasons previously given they believe that the grant of this concession involves logically the grant of ordinary political rights of speech-making, canvassing, etc., to the members of these groups, when out of uniform, but they see no reason to apprehend injury to the national interests from this relaxation either They feel justified in assuming that British civil servants of whatever grade will continue to maintain that high standard of professional loyalty and integrity which experience shows to be quite compatible with keen political partisanship.65. But in this opinion we are not all agreed. Those of us who differ from it appreciate fully the cogency of the argument by which it is supported, and they recognise the importance of the safeguards suggested, particularly by the stipulation that election to Parliament, if candidature without resignation be permitted, must in all eases involve immediate retirement from the service with loss of pension rights. They withhold their concurrence, however, for two reasons. The first is practical. While their colleagues recognise that still further classification might be required, in their view, if the principle, upon the preservation of which all are agreed, is to be effectively main-tained such classification would be essential. But that essential classification when made, and however carefully, would, they are also satisfied, be a source of greater discontent than a general exclusion. Even so they might have hesitated to adhere to a general exclusion, not perhaps theoretically justifiable, had it not been for their second reason to which they now advert.
This privilege, safeguarded as it must admittedly be, would be, they feel, of little advantage to any individual, while its undue extension would, they are satisfied, be injurious, to the State. Such injury by any undue extension they are not prepared to risk by any. recommendation of theirs, especially as they believe the fact to be that the right to contest a Parliamentary seat without loss of situation in the process is one of the rarest of privileges in other spheres of employment indeed is one which would not be thought to be fairly claimable as a term of service by those engaged for their full time therein.66. So far therefore we are not of one mind. We are in fact equally divided. But. one differentiation we are all agreed is practicable; namely where the employment is &apos;&apos; industrial &apos;&apos; in type and that in establishments where it is predominantly so. We were all very favourably impressed by the evidence as to the dockyard employees given to us by Councillor Gourd and Alder-man Harries on this point, and by the fact that until 1920 the Service rule appears to have been honoured in the Dockyards and Arsenal rather in the breach than in the observance.67. It can we think fairly be said of these men that in the sense of this report their Government employment is an accident. Their general conditions of employment are governed by those of the craft or trade to which they belong : they are primarily craftsmen of that trade ; and they are separated in organisation and constant contact from the Departments staffed by those who would everywhere be primarily regarded as Servants of the Crown.68. As to these industrials accordingly we all of us would recommend the restoration of the status quo ante by the with-drawal of the Admiralty order of 1920, placing in the same position the industrials (excluding any of supervisory grades at present included in that grouping) in the service of the Army Council and the Air Council.69. Those of us who hold the^yiews stated in paragraphs 62 to 64 above would go further, and just as they would concede liberty in this respect to members of the manipulative and messenger groups so with even less hesitation they would include in any concession made all industrial employees, in whatever Depart-ment engaged.70. Those of us who hold the contrary view are not unmindful of the difficulty of defending logically the differentiation of the industrial employee of say the Post Office from the similar employee in the Arsenal or the Dockyards. But they feel that the practical objections to creating in the same organisation differentiations in the conditions of service which do not at present exist and (here is an important distinction) did not exist even before the Admiralty order of&apos; 1920, far outweigh the logical objections described above; and that is&apos; why our unanimous recommendation does not extend beyond the industrial employees of the establishments named.
But even those of us who are&apos; responsible for the limitation would not be sorry if it were found possible to include, with those the workers in any other establishments, if such there be, where the employment is predominantly industrial and differentiation can be introduced by general consent.71. As regards the consequences of successful Parliamentary candidature, this would of course involve resignation of employ-nient from the date of election and we understand that in the Civil Service proper an employee is not re-employed after resig-nation unless he is reinstated, but there does not appear to be a similar difficulty for the industrial. Re-employment for the Civil Servant is a privilege which we see no reason to concede to the special class of politician. He has, it must&apos; be assumed, voluntarily surrendered the sheltered position which the terms of his service had given him, but equally if under the industrial system of weekly wages with no security a man is eligible for employment or . re-employment irrespective of his previous employment there should be no discrimination against the person who has been a member of Parliament. On the other hand pension or other rights which are lost on voluntary resignation would be equally lost on election to Parliament.Municipal Councils.72. We are in favour of leaving this question to Departmental regulation as at present.It has been urged that municipal elections are as political as Parliamentary elections. This may be true, but the work after election is primarily administrative. Further, the objection to Parliamentary candidature, that it is an attempt to make a fusion of the functions of employer and employee does not here apply; nor does the local authority manage State Funds.On the other hand there are Departments whose duties largely consist in the regulation of local authorities, and in these cases it would clearly be wrong to allow candidature. It is to us unthink-able that an official Of the Ministry of Health shoidd serve on a local authority.Maltese Dockyard.73. We understand that our advice is asked on a question which arose about two years ago in regard to the newly-con-stituted Malta Legislature.Under its constitution, any male British subject over 21 years of age is (subject to certain qualifications) entitled to be elected tc the Legislative Assembly. But there are certain exceptions, one of which is that of a person who &apos;&apos; holds any office of profit under the Crown within the Island, other than the Office of a Minister, provided that persons in receipt of a pension from the Crown and officers of the Naval, Military or Air Forces in receipt of retired or half pay, and University teachers not prohibited
from the private exercise of their profession and not bound to offer their services to the Maltese Government during the entire day, shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit under the Crown.&quot; The Colonial Office and the Admiralty have been legally advised that employees of the Imperial Government in such a capacity as Dockyard Workmen are not disqualified by that exception ; but whether this is so or not, the present position is that under general rules governing the Civil Service, employees of the Imperial Government in Malta are not allowed more favourable treatment in respect of candidature for the Island Legislature than is granted to such employees who seek election to the Imperial Parliament.74. The reversal of this decision is proposed by the Governor of Malta, the Colonial Office and the Admiralty, on the ground that the workmen employed in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyard com-prise a very desirable element whose co-operation it was hoped to secure when this measure of self-government was decided on.75. We feel that this argument might be turned against the proposed concession. It is in effect that the political candidature of certain Government employees should be permitted, and even encouraged, because their political influence will be exercised in a particular way. It reminds us of the practice of pre-revolutionary Germany of including Civil Servants in the Reich-stag as Government supporters. Some other justification for the concession is we think essential. This is sought to be found in the contention by the Admiralty that the limitation of the powers of the Malta Legislature to local matters and the fact that questions of conditions of service, etc., in His Majesty&apos;s establish-ments are beyond its competence suffice to show that there is no real analogy between the Malta Legislature and the Imperial Parliament, from which hitherto dockyard workers have been excluded. The real analogy they say is with County Councils for which since 1909 Admiralty employees have been eligible.Here again we feel that the comparison with a County Council is at best only a theoretical one, and we would also point out that there is only no bar to election to County Councils provided there is no interference with official duties, subject it is true to the grant of a certain amount of special unpaid leave in the dockyards. From this point of view the duties of a Malta legislator must make demands on his full time and energies more approximating to those of an M.P. than of a County Councillor.76. After careful consideration, we feel that the question of candidature of Admiralty workmen for the Malta Legislature must be decided on the same lines as that of candidature for the Imperial Parliament.77. Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : PARLIAMENTARY CANDIDATURE.We are agreed that (subject to the exceptions mentioned below) the general rule should be identical for all Crown Services and
should take the form of the existing Civil Service rule whereby a candidate must resign from the Service on candidature.The precise regulations to give effect to this are a matter for detailed consideration of the authorities concerned in each case, e.g., a Civil Servant is free to resign at any time whereas a fight-ing man is not, and therefore the rule for the fighting services would be a prohibition of candidature while serving.On the exceptions to be admitted to this general rule we are divided, but we are all agreed that certain industrial staffs should be excepted, and we accordingly imanimo-iisly recommend the reversal of the Order of 1920 which applied the Civil Service rule to the industrial staffs under the fighting departments (paragraphs 66-71).Some of us would go further and would extend the exception to(i) the industrial staffs in all Departments (paragraph 69).(ii) the manipulative and some other subordinate grades, with certain reservations (paragraphs 62-64).MUNICIPAL   CANDIDATURE.Should be left as at present to Departmental discretion, subject-to no moral or material interference with official duties.MALTESE  DOCKYARD.Candidature of Admiralty workmen for Maltese Legislature should follow the rules for candidature of Admiralty workmen for the Imperial Parliament.78. In conclusion we would desire to&apos; acknowledge in the fullest possible way the invaluable service rendered to- us throughout our enquiry by our Secretary, Mr. W. R. Eraser of the Treasury. Mr. Eraser&apos;s intimate knowledge of the whole subject and his ready help at every stage of our work have alone made possible the discharge by us, however imperfect, of what has proved to be a difficult task.Blanesbtjrgh  (Chairman)G.
