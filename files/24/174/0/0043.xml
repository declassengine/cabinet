O) 4ItTS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANN IC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.PT3?4 (25).CABINET.SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES.LEATHER &amp; FABRIC GLOVES.v CDMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I circulate the report of the Safeguarding of Industries Committee on Gloves, together with the covering letter from the Chairman.     I think there Is a clear case for the Imposition of a duty on both leather and fabric gloves.The following table shows the British production ofleather gloves and the volume of retained Imports, and the ratio of the latter to the formerBritish Retained    Ratio of RetainedProduction.

If the Industry is to be treated as a post-war Industry.In view of the majority report, I do not think we should be justified In Imposing a duty on glove fabric.
The Chairman&apos;s letter specifically raises two points -the date of publication of reports and the date from which duties should be imposed.     This will have to be considered when a decision is taken on the general question of publication of these reports and dates of the imposition of duties, a question on which I hope to circulate a memorandum shortly.(Intd. ) P.C.Board of Trade, 13th July, 1925.
Q 1  LEATHER AND FABRIC GLOVES COMMITTEE.6th July, 1925.Sir,Should the Committee&apos;s recommendation regarding the duty be adopted by the Government and submitted to the House of Commons we would strongly urge, if such procedure is in order, that the date from which the duties operate be the date on which publicity is given to the Committee1s report.     If this Is not done, we consider that the object of safeguarding this Industry will be to a large extent defeated as Importers will have time to obtain large quantities from abroad to oover their requirements for a long period ahead.     If this is not practicable we would urge that publication of the Committee^ recommendations be not made until Parliamentary action Is commenced to make, them operative.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant., (Sgd.)O.J.STEWART, Chairman.Rt. Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.C, M.P. President,Board of Trade.
BOARD        OP       TRADESAFEGUARDING     OF     INDUSTRIESREPORT OFCOMMITTEE ON Leather Gloves, Fabric Gloves and Glove Fabric.
BOARD        OP       TRADE. This 25th day of April,  1925,The Board of Trade are hereby pleased to appoint the following lady and gentlemen to be a Committee to enquire into and report upon applications made by the Joint Industrial Council for the Glove Making Industry, the National Association of Fabric Glove Manufacturers of Great Britain and the Glove and Warp Fabric Makers1 Association, in accordance with the terms of the Memorandum relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding   of Industries, presented to Parliament on the 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty upon leather gloves and fabric gloves and glove fabric:-Sir C.J.Stewart, K.3.E., (Chairman). Lady Askwith, C.B.E., and Mr. F.R. Davenport.The Board of Trade are further pleased to appoint Mr. S.E.J. Brady, M.B.E., to be Secretary to the Committee.(Signed)      P. CUNLIFFE-LISTER,
The Rt. Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, K.B.E., M.G,, M.P.President of the Board of Trade.1. We were appointed on the 25th April, 1925, to be a Committee to enquire into applications from organisa-tions in the industries concerned, for the imposition of a duty upon leather gloves, fabric gloves and glove fabric.2, We have held 16 meetings and have taken evidence from manufacturers, Trade Union representatives, wholesale buyers, and retailers.   The total number of witnesses who submitted evidence to us is 40.   With the exception   of 4, who were examined in camera, the witnesses were heard at Public Sittings.3. The case for the Applicants was conducted by Mr. W,Barnard Faraday who called evidence from the following bodies in support of the claim for a duty:-(a) Joint Industrial Council for the Glove-MakingIndustry, (employers and employees gave evidence),(b) The National Association of Fabric GloveManufacturers of Great Britain,(o) The Glove and Warp Fabric Makers&apos; Association.The application was opposed by a group of London and Manchester wholesale distributing houses who were represented by Mr.C.F. Entwlstle,4, The Drapers&apos; Chamber of Trade were asked whether they desired to tender evidence on behalf of retail distributors but they informed us that, in view of the political issues involved, they did not wish to do so.5. The Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Associations Limited, who opposed the application under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, as they considered that a duty on fabric gloves and glove fabric would exert an adverse
effect on the fine spinning se-c/tion of the OKrb-ton industry in the United Kingdom, were also invited to give evidence, but they declined to do so referring us to their evidence in the previous enquiry.Leather Gloves. 6. The Applicants contended that their industry was highly skilled and has existed in this country for several centuries.    They claimed to be able to produce any kind of glove which is now imported provided that they were protected from unfair competition.    They mentioned that although the imports were less than in 1913, there was a smaller consumption of gloves to-day, and several types of the gloves now being imported are similar to those which have always been regarded as typically British. Further, they submitted that even If all the imported gloves had been of a different type from the British, they would be substitutes for the latter and, therefore, the whole of the imports should be regarded as competitive, They drew attention to the fact, that whereas during-the past few years their production had remained almost stationary, the imports over the same period have shown a steady increase, month by month and employment in this   -country is thereby threatened.7. The Opponents did not&apos; dispute the efficiency of British manufacturers and asserted that leather gloves made in this country are the finest in the world.   They,-however, pointed out that the British export trade had fallen   off considerably since 1913 and that this was sufficient reason for the reduced employment.    They also contended, that with the sole exception of castor gloves which compete with the British doeskin - more commonly known as-Chamois or wash leather gloves - the types imported are not and   have not for many years   been made here.   They therefore
submitted that the imports are not of the same &quot;class or description&quot; as the gloves produced here, that the retained imports are not abnormal, and that the Applicants could not bring their case within the terms of the White Paper.Fabric Gloves. 8, With regard to fabric gloves and glove fabric, the Applicants claimed to be considered as a post-war industry.   They mentioned that the industry in this country before the war was small and in the hands of about 6 firms, but, under the complete protection afforded them by the war, they developed considerably until 1920 when they claimed that over 60 firms were engaged in the manufacture of gloves in the United Kingdom,   During 1920, severe competition from Germany began to be experienced and several firms had to close down.    It was established at the last enquiry (under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921) that by the end of 1921 the number    of firms In this country had fallen to about 20. We are now informed that the numbers have still further been reduced to 15.    It is no doubt true that the gloves produced by several British manufacturers up to 1919-20 were not of the same standard as that obtaining In Germany but this is largely accounted for by the fact that the industry had been established in Chemnitz for a long period of years whereas the British industry developed during the time of war when they had to meet the    natural difficulties as regards machinery and labour.    We are satisfied, however, that British manufacturers have considerably Improved their products during the past few   years and we are of opinion that the types   of fabric gloves now produced in this country
are fairly comparable in fit and finish with those at present manufactured abroad.    The Applicants maintained that they were unable to meet Continental competition, principally on account of the lower wages, lower taxation and lower overhead charges abroad,9, The Opponents asserted that the fabric glove industry in this country is not of substantial importance and that the retained imports are not abnormal.   They mentioned that the range   of goods in demand to-day is very extensive, and that British manufacturers can compete on some classes of fabric gloves but not on light weight gloves or fancy gloves which require greater attention to detail and precision   in manufacture.    German factory conditions they stated are excellent but a high rate of production is insisted on.   They claim a higher production per worker than that obtained in this country, and they submitted that the lower prices of the German goods were due, not only to the higher production, but also to the fact that the industry in Chemnitz consists of 400-500 firms, many of whom work on but few types of cloth.    Further by reason of the enormous output and the highly specialised nature of the industry In Germany, 3ritish manufacturers could not hope to compete with the production of that country,Glove Fabric.10. The Applicants stated that they are capable of producing the whole of the glove   fabric required for the needs of this country and that their product has considerably improved daring the past few years until it is now equal in every respect to the German product.11, The Opponents, however,  stated that the German cloth was much superior in finish and that abnormal imports could not be proved by the Applicants.
12. We have considered the question of glove fabric and are of opinion that the Applicants have not established a claim for a duty,   We are satisfied that British manufacturers can produce glove fabric comparable with that manufactured in Germany but from the relative prices submitted to us we are not convinced that the disparity is so great as to merit the imposition of an import duty.   Moreover, on several types of cloth we consider that British manufacturers can compete on level terms with Germany.An additional reason for refusing the claim for a duty on glove fabric   is that in the event   of a duty being imposed on fabric gloves, employment is likely to be more substantially increased by permitting imports of fabric to British glove manufacturers,13. We now deal with the questions on which we are asked to report, as laid down in the White Paper (Cmd.2327) relating to procedure and enquiries under the Safeguarding of Industries proposals.(1) Whether the applicant industry is, by reason of&apos; the volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an industry   of substantial importance. &apos;    &quot;&quot;&quot;        &quot;*14. The glove industry for this purpose should, we consider,be taken as a whole.   The Ministry of Labour does not recordthis trade separately under the Unemployment Insurance Actsbut, from the evidence submitted to us, it would appear that atthe present time there are about 10,000 persons employed in themanufacture of leather gloves and a further 1,800 In the manu-facture of fabric gloves.   We are therefore of opinion that theglove industry can be regarded as an industry of substantialimportance,(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relatesAre being imported into and retained for con-sumption In the United Kingdom in abnormalquantities.
coo. i) hi tj15,   The imports, exports and re-exports of leather gloves/for the years 1913, and 1921 to 1925 are shown in Appendix &quot;A&quot;.It will be observed that the Imports for 1924 are less thanthose of 1913.    This, we were assured by many witnesses, is dueto the fact that the total consumption of gloves has considerablydeclined since 1913,    It will be noticed that the import figuresfrom Italy show a great increase, viz. from 11,379 dozen pairsin 1913 to 413,421 dozen pairs in 1924.    This figure was disputedby the Opponents, and, on enquiry, we ascertained that before thewar, and until the last two or three years, it was the commonpractice for the bulk of gloves despatched from Italy to thiscountry, to be sent by Parcel Post.    These gloves, therefore,would not be recorded in the British Trade Returns,   We areInformed that gloves are still imported by Parcel Post from Italy,but not to the same extent as in 1913.    We have, therefore,obtained the Italian official figures of the exports of leathergloves from Italy to the United Kingdom.    They are as under: -1913........24,812 hundred pairs    (206,766 doz.)1924........ 70,204     &quot; &quot; (585,033   &quot;    )Prom the evidence submitted to us it would appear that the Italian glove industry has considerably developed since 1913 and it has captured a large proportion of the cheap end of the glove trade which was formerly in the hands of Germany and Austria-Hungary.   As the total re-exports of leather gloves from all sources in 1924 only amounted to 50,120 dozen pairs, we are of opinion, that as regards Italy, imports are being retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.    It will be noticed from Appendix A that the British recorded imports (which exclude Parcel Post) Indicate that the imports from Italy form a large proportion of our total imports, i.e., nearly 46 per cent.    Prom this table it will also be seen that the imports from Belgium, Prance and Cze oho -Slovakia show steady increases over the past 4 years.
16.   As the question of abnormal retained imports is probably the most important point with whioh we are asked to deal, we have directed a great deal of attention thereto. It has been shown above that the imports from Italy in particular are decidedly abnormal,17.   With regard to imports in general, we give in Appendix &quot;B&quot;, a table showing the total monthly imports of leather gloves during the past 5 years.    This table shows clearly how the imports have steadily risen during that period and seems to us to be strong evidence as to the abnormal nature of the Imports.    It will be noticed (a) that each year from 1921 to 1924 shows a considerable increase over the previous year, and (b) that taking the table as a whole, the imports have been steadily rising throughout the period covered therein.     The imports during the first five months of this year maintain this tendency.    The total re-exports are given in Appendix &quot;A&quot; and are too small to affect in any way conclusions which might be drawn from the table of monthly imports in Appendix &quot;B&quot;.18.    The following table shows the retained imports and the home production for 1913 and 1920 to 1924, together with the percentage of total consumption in the home market of both British and foreign.     This table Indicates that the total consumption of leather gloves in this country is less than before the war but more than double that of 1920 and that, whereas the British manufacturer has, broadly speaking, only been able to maintain his production of 1920, the foreign manufacturers have been steadily increasing their proportion.

19.    It was asserted by the Opponents that many types of leather gloves now being imported are of a type not produced in this country, that British manufacturers have maintained their full share of the home market in the class of goods In which they specialise, and that, therefore, the imports had in no way affected them.     The evidence submitted to us indicated that there are many types of gloves imported which are not at present produced in this country but we are satisfied that many of these were produced here before the war and could tie made to-day if the Industry were safeguarded from unfair competition. Apart from the above question as to the nature of the imports, we are convinced that foreign manufacturers are now exporting to this country several classes of leather gloves which hitherto have been regarded as exclusively British specialities.     The Trade Returns do not separately classify different kinds of leather gloves but we have examined numerous samples which confirm our view that the British manufacturer is now meeting more severe competition in his own class of goods than hitherto.     After examination of this question, in all its bearings, we have no hesitation in describing the imports of leather gloves as being retained in abnormal quantities.-1.1-
Fabric Gloves.20.    It was contended by the Applicants that the fabric glove industry should be treated as a post-war industry and that a comparison with 1913 was unreasonable.     After careful consideration of the evidence we are inclined to agree with this contention.     It has been established to our satisfaction that the industry developed considerably during the war, spent large sums on fresh plant and the training of workers and it was not until 1918-19 that the industry reached its maximum production.     The consumption of fabric gloves has fallen since 1913 in common with leather gloves.     In Appendix &quot;C&quot; we give the imports, exports and re-exports of fabric gloves.21,    We have prepared the following table in order clearly to visualise the position with regard to fabric gloves -

The above table shows, that whereas in 1913, 92.3/S of the - -consumption of fabric gloves in the United Kingdom were offoreign manufacture, the industry in this country developed soconsiderably since that date, that in 1920, british manufacturers had secured 84$ of the home market, thus almostreversing the pre-war position.   The table further shows that since that year foreign manufacturers have been steadilyimproving their position, and now, the British manufacturers are almost back again to where they were in 1913.22.   Vie are of opinion, that for purposes of comparison, it isonly fair to treat the fabric glove industry as a pogt-war industry.   We are strengthened in this view by the fact that enquiries under the White Paper are with the object of safeguarding industries.   If, therefore, an industry has developed to such an extent as to be capable of meeting almost the entire demands of the home market1&apos; in 1920, although it onlyhad a very small proportion before the war, it would, in ourview, be unjust to exclude such an industry from the benefit ofthe proposals by assuming that rigid regard must be hadto the situation in 1913.The Applicants have proved to us that their productivecapacity from 1913 to 1920 increased more than seven-fold but during 1924 their production was less than in 1913.   Taking allthese circumstances into consideration, we are of opinion thatImported fabric gloves are being retained in the United kingdom in abnormal quantities,(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale In the United Kingdom at prices t which&quot;&quot; are below the prices&quot; at which similar goods&quot; can be &quot;&quot;&quot;profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.23.   We have examined very many types and grades of leather andfabric gloves and are of opinion that, in the classes of goodsmanufactured in this country, our manufacturers are meetingsevere competition from oomparable goods which are being sold or offered for sale at prices at which British firmscannot profitably manufacture them.
24,   We are aware that there are several types of glovesImported which are not at present made in this country.   Thesegloves are, in most cases, however, substitutes for gloves whichcan be produced here and it is impossible to discriminate between them, as a duty on one class would only tend to divertthe demand to another type, and thereby nullify the effect of any duty which might be imposed.(4) Whether., by reason of the severity and extent of such competition, employment&apos; in the manufacture or production of such goods in the Tjnlted&apos; Kingdom is being&apos;,&apos; or&quot;&apos;is&apos; likely &quot;to be. seriously affected?25,   As already stated, the glove industry is not recorded separately by the Ministry of Labour under the UnemploymentInsurance Acts and we have not, therefore, been able to secure from that Department information as to the extent of theunemployment in this: industry.   With regard to the leatherglove section, the Joint Industrial Council claim that whereas in 1913 they had 9,321 workers on full time, i.e. 52hours per week, the total number employed in 1924 had fallen to 7,032 who were working, on an average, 40 hours a week.Speaking generally, 5Q% of the workers in this industry areoutworkers, so that it is not possible to state what hours areworked by this section but from the evidence given to us by   -the Trade Unions concerned we are convinced that under-employment exists among the outworkers as well as the factoryworkers.   We are also of opinion that there is serious unemploy-ment in various glove centres, and, judging by the steady increase in the imports, there is no doubt in our minds that employment is likely to be seriously affected in the nearfuture.26. Production in the leather glove trade is practically governed by and dependent upon the number of cutters employed, this being the principal branch of the Industry and the most highly skilled.   Cutters serve a long apprenticeship and before the war there was a definite proportion of apprentices
to cutters I.e. one apprentice to five cutters.   Taking the trade as a whole, we are informed that there are 746 cutters now engaged and only 53 apprentices instead of the normal number of about 150.   Of the 746 cutters there are 168 who are over the age of 50 years.   These figures can only be regarded as Indicating that a highly skilled industry has now reached a position when it is struggling for existence and we are of opinion that employment Is, and Is likely to be, seriously affected by reason of the severity and extent of foreign competition.27.    It was asserted by the Opponents that the types of leather gloves imported are not affecting British employment as they are of a different class of goods from that produced here.   They stated, however, that the gloves which British manufacturers produce are the best in the world.   If this is so and we believe that, for the class of goods produced here, it is a statement of fact, then we see no reason to suppose that in an article of this nature, British manufacturers could not be able to produce most of the types of gloves which are now Imported and the competition from which is causing unemployment.   Evidence was given to us by workers employed in making leather gloves that, before the war, they made several of the varieties of gloves which are now being entirely imported.     They claimed to be able to cut and make any of these types again and we are satisfied that they are capable of so doing.28. With regard to fabric gloves, the situation is also serious.   According to the Applicants, there were employed in the manufacture of fabric gloves 2,400 in 1913 all working full time.   It will be seen from the report of the previous Committee under the Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921, that the numbers had increased to a maximum of 10,948 In July, 1919. We are informed that today there are approximately only 1,800
inn 0*3 Cpersons employed working on the average 30 hours a week.   Itwill he seen that employment since the Industry reached its maximum production has been considerably reduced and the small numbers now engaged in the trade are much under-employed. Webelieve that the industry could again develop to a much higher rate of production and consequently afford increased employ-ment, should they be given some measure of protection from thecompetition which they are now experiencing.(5) Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where the conditions are so different from those LnHEhis country as to render the competition unfalrT &apos;29. The evidence under the above clause of the White Paper was very conflicting but after careful consideration we are strongly of opinion that competition may be deemed unfair.   We briefly summarise the reasons for our conclusions on this point:-(a) Lower wages in most of the competing countries e.g. in Germany, Italy, Belgium and Prance.(b) Heavier taxation (including income tax, local rates, Health and Unemployment Insurance), in the United Kingdom as compared with all of the above countries.(c) By reason of depreciated currencies many of our competitors can operate their factories at lower overhead costs. Interest on and redemption of debentures, for example, In Germany would in many cases have been extinguished at a very low cost while their currency was depreciating prior to 1923, also buildings, plant and machinery, etc., could have been heavily written down.(d) Hours of labour on the Continent are longer thanin this country.   Here the hours are 47 to 48 and in Germany from 51 to 63.   Further, whereas in the British leather glove industry practically half the workers are outworkers, on the Continent a much greater proportion are outworkers who are not limited in hours.   Cutters, for example, are the pivotal

We briefly summarise the reasons for our conclusions on this point:-(a) Lower wages in most of the competing countries e.g. in Germany, Italy, Belgium and France.(b) Heavier taxation (including income tax, local rates, Health and Unemployment Insurance), in the United Kingdom as compared with all of the above countries.(e) By reason of depreciated currencies many of our competitors can operate their factories at lower overhead costs Interest on and redemption of debentures, for example, In Germany would in many cases have been extinguished at a very low cost while their currency was depreciating prior to 1923, also buildings, plant and machinery, etc., could have been heavily written down,(d) Hours of labour on the Continent are longer than in this country.   Here the hours are 47 to 48 and in Germany from 51 to 63,   Further, whereas in the British leather glove industry practically half the workers are outworkers, on the Continent a much greater proportion are outworkers who are not limited in hours.   Cutters, for example, are the pivotal
o, 9Counoil for the Gloves Making Industry drew the attention of the Board of Trade in January of this year to this point by sending them the following resolution:-&quot;Merchandise^Jfexrks Act&quot;&quot;That glovea coming into this country should bear &quot;a stamp conspicuously placed indicating the country &quot;of origin, irrespective of whether suoh gloves bear &quot;the name of an English firm or not&quot;.We agree with this resolution and strongly recommend that action should be taken on it.(h) A further handioap to the British manufacturer is the high oost of distribution.    We had an Instance quoted to us where the retail prioe was double that of the British Manufacturer^ selling price and we were assured that this was not an isolated Instance.    It is the custom for the wholesale distributing house to Impose a flat rate of profit on the gloves he purchases and the retailer then adds his percentage, whioh is much higher than that of the wholesaler.   This flat rate percentage is undoubtedly a handioap to the British manufacturer&quot; as, if his glove is a few shillings per dozen more than the foreign when sold by the factory, it is clear that if the same percentage of profit is put on by the wholesale and retail distributors the disparity between British and foreign prices tends to be considerably widened, particularly in so far as it affects the ultimate purchaser.30.   We have received no evidenoe on the question of subsidies or bounties in the case of our foreign competitors.(6) Whether the applicant industry is being oarrled on in the United Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and economy.31. With regard to leather gloves, we are of opinion that the gloves produced here are being manufactured with reasonable efficiency and economy.   This was not disputed.32, With respect to fabric gloves the position is somewhat different.   Our main oompetltor Is Germany, who, before the war established a considerable Industry which is highly organised and, so far as the evidenoe goes to show, very efficient*     The
is very much smaller than in Germany.   During the past fewyears competition has been so severe that no doubt those ofour manufacturers who were inefficient have had to leave theindustry, but we are satisfied that those remaining areproducing gloves fairly comparable with the imported article.(7) Whether the imposition of a duty on goods, of the olasu or description in question would exert a. seriously &quot;adverse effect on employment 3-n any other industry,  being ah industry using goods of TTEat oTass or description m production.33.    It can hardly be said that there is an industry whichcould strictly be called an industry &quot;using gloves in production&quot; no that in our view no adverse effect v/ould be caused by the imposition of a duty.   We are informed, however,that there are certain auxiliary industries such as box making,button making, etc., which have been considerably affected bythe decline in the home production of gloves.    Greaterproduction of gloves in this country would therefore have a beneficial effect on these industries and not an adverse effect.The Opponents maintained that unemployment would be caused indistributing houses.   We are not satisfied that there wouldbe any appreciable diminution of employment among this type of firm should a duty be imposed on gloves.(8) Whether, having regard to the abovo conditions, the applicant industry has,  in&quot;the opinion of the Committee, established a &quot;claim to^ a&quot; dutyjT&quot;and if so,&apos; what rate  : [ or rates of dui^y, &quot;in &quot;the&quot;opini&apos;qn of the &quot;Gommittee, &quot;would be reasonably &quot;sufTiclEent -&apos;to&quot;oounteryail J&amp;ie. unfair&apos; competitioh.34. The Applicants, both for leather and fabric gloves,  askedfor a    specific duty but on carefully examining their proposals we have arrived at the conclusion that on account of the wide range of prices it would be extremely difficult to arriveat an equitable rate.     The amounts suggested to us, weconsider would press too hoavily on the lower end of thetrade, amounting, in the case of certain fabric gloves, to no
Ie3s than 100 per cent.     If a duty is imposed, we do not think that a specific duty should be levied and after an examination of the prices of many kinds of British and foreign leather and fabric gloves we consider that a duty at the rate of 33 1/3$ would be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition.     We therefore recommend that a duty of 33 1/3% ad valorem should be imposed for at least five years on imports into this country of:-(a) Leather gloves, whether finished or out outready for sewing;(b) All classes of gloves made from cotton if known in the trade as &quot;Fabric gloves&quot;j and(o) Unfinished cotton fabric gloves, i.e., cotton glove fabric which has been cut out ready for sewing and excluding material in the piece.35.     We do not recommend a duty on fabric gloves of silk and artificial silk as we are satisfied from the evidence given before us that the measure of protection afforded them in the Finance Act of this year gives them sufficient margin to enable them successfully to compete with foreign competition in the home market.36.     As mentioned in paragraph 12 we do not recommend a duty on glove fabricWe desire to express our warm appreciation of the services of our Secretary, Captain S.B.J. Brady, who has given us every possible assistance throughout our enquiry, in preparing statistics, and in framing our report.We have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient Servants,(Signed)    0. J.

RESERVATION.I dissent from the ruling re glove fabric for the following reasons:-1. In my opinion the application of the makers, of glovefabric and^the makers of fabric gloves should be treated as one. as was done in the Report of the Committee of12. The Glove and Warp Fabric Makers&apos; Association isalso a post-war industry, it had 165 machines working in 1913, 350 machines in 1918 to 1919, and only 85 working in 1924.3. British manufacturers claim that they can produceall the fabric needed for the home market, and it was held by the majority of witnesses that the manufacture of fabric gloves could not pay unless the manufacturer made his own cloth,4. A tax having been imposed on imported silk glovefabric,  it will, in my opinion, operate unfairly on that industry should cotton glove fabric come in free.(Signed) Ellen Askwlth.
