MEMORANDUM FOR THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT.1. The Air Ministry has in contemplation theformation of a number of aerodromes which will entail large building programmes In certain agricultural districts; the Ministry of Agriculture and the farmers in the districts concerned are naturally anxious that agricultural labourers shall not be drawn off the land by obtaining employment at more remunerative rates on these works.2. With a view to safeguarding agricultural interests,the Ministry of Labour has put forward a proposal that a clause should be Inserted in Air Ministry contracts by which contractors for the works programmes would be obliged to draw their unskilled labour from the nearest Employment Exchange, with the exception of men regularly In the employ of the contractors, or men&apos; who customarily follow contracts of this nature from job to job. .,3, &apos;        It is further suggested by the Ministry of Labour that motor transport should, if necessary, be provided to take men from the nearest industrial centre to the site of the works, or, alternatively, where conditions require it, to house the men on the site in hutted camps.4*. The question has been Investigated by theAir Ministry, and the views of several of the large contractors obtained.     As a result of these investigations and enquiries, it would appear to the Ministry that the enforcement of such restrictions will inevitably entail additional expenditure on Air Votes, while some extra cost must be involved by the provision of motor transport or hutting....5. The Air Ministry estimates that the number ofunskilled labourers required will be approximately 3,000, of whom one third would probably, in the normal course, be drawn from agricultural sources.     The period of employment may be assumed at from 2 to 3 years.6. On a basis of these figures and the views of the contractors consulted, the additional cost involved Is estimated by the Air Ministry, very approximately, at  240,000 equalling 5^ per cent   on the total value of the works.     Of this sum, some  66,Q00 represents motor transport and/or hutting, the balance being due to the restrictions with regard to the sources from which labour may be drawn.7. The Air Ministry is also of opinion that therestrictions In question will tend to delay the works, owing to the decreased fluidity of the labour.8. On the other hand, the Ministry of Labourconsider that no additional cost should be involved by applying the restrictions, provided arrangements are made for the selection of suitable labour at the sourae of supply,
and suggest that the views of   the contractors are probably coloured by experience on works which have been carried out on a relief basis., where men have been employed at the desire of the local Authority who were not entirely suitable for the work in question.9. It will be recognised that the only definitetest that can be made to determine what additional cost will ensue from the enforcement of the restrictions proposed, is to obtain alternative tenders for a specific job, and steps are being taken to obtain such tenders in the case of two stations.10. The result of this action will not beavailable for some time, but, meanwhile, the Air Ministry feels unable to depart from the view that substantial additional expenditure-will be involved, though the percentage given in paragraph 6 above may possibly be reduced later If the labour obtained through the Employment Exchanges is found by the contractors to be ^suitable.
