Phis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;!Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1925.SECRET. - 3C.P. 359 (25).CABINET.SPECIAL  REPORT  ON   UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 118.     June 1925.THE past month has recorded a&apos; very considerable increase in the number of persons on the registers of Employment Exchanges. While it is usual to find increased registrations in the weeks immediately following Whitsuntide, the increase this year was practically double that of 1924, and the set-back was not recovered in the same way as last year.This unsatisfactory position is mainly the result of further depression in the coal-mining industry, but certain of the other principal industries, including iron and steel, shipbuilding, woollen manufacture, and pottery, have contributed to the decline. Such improvement as is reported in other trades is largely of a seasonal character.It will be noted that during the last week of the month the numbers of men on the Registers showed a slight reduction, though this was more than off-set by an increase in the number of women registered. An analysis by industries of these fluctuations is not yet available but it appears that the decrease arises principally at Employment Exchanges serving coal-mining areas in the Midlands and Nortti-Eastern Counties.   The increase in women occurs in textile areas.A. STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,July 27, 1925.I.(A.)

II. POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES. COAL MINING.A large increase in the number of coal-miners unemployed occurred during the month. The closing of more pits was reported from all the principal centres, and much short time was worked. The depression has now seriously affected the South Yorkshire coal-held, in which the position had previously been less unsatisfactory than in other areas, and development work which was proceeding at Doncaster has been partially interrupted.IRON AND STEEL.Employment in this industry suffered a further slight decline during the month. The position became worse at a number of centres in South Staffordshire and at Barrow, and short time was again worked in many districts. Little, change occurred in Scotland, but in South Wales a slight advance towards recovery was made.TIN-PLATE TRADE.The slow recovery in this industry was maintained, Swansea, Neath ana Port Talbot among the more important centres showing distinct improvement.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.Employment in this industry remained very bad generally, and showed a further slight decline during the month. The improvement previously reported from the Tyne was not maintained; further depression occurred on the Wear; and little change took place at other ports on the North-East Coast. Repair work on the Thames showed some improvement. On the South Coast employment was generally slack, and the position was poor at the Bristol Channel ports except at Swansea and Barry, from which continued improvement was reported. Little change occurred on the Mersey, though ship-repairing was better at Bootle. Barrow reports the absence of new contracts to replace vessels now launched, and a similar position is reported from Scotland.ENGINEERING.Motor, Cycle, and Aircraft Engineering. Employment was good at most places, but in a few districts some slackness was shown.General Engineering. The slight improvement reported last month in certain districts was maintained, but employment on the whole was not good, especially in heavy engineering. In electrical engineering the position remained good in the Midlands, but some slackness was shown in the South-Eastern Counties. Definite improvement took place m textile engineering in the North-Western area, and most firms were fully employed, while at Oldham short-time working was reduced. At Keighley, however, less activity was shown. Employment in marine engineering remained very bad. Employment in agricultural engineering was fair on the whole except at Bedford, where some slackness prevailed. In railway engineering continued activity was shown at Lancashire centres except Openshaw, where a slight decline took place. Short-time working continued at certain of the L. and N.-E. Railway centres.TEXTILES.Cotton.-There was an increase of unemployment in certain districts, and the position generally was slightly worse than last month. Increased unemployment among weavers was reported from Blackburn and Preston. There was also a decrease in trade in the Egyptian cotton-spinning centres, particularly at Bolton and Leigh. In the American cotton-spinning section the ballot on the proposal to increase the working hours to 39-^ per week resulted in favour of the increase. Little change took place in the textile bleaching, printing, dyeing and finishing sections, and short-time working continued in most centres.Woollens and Worsteds. Employment further declined at most centres in the North-Eastern area, and Employment Exchanges in this area all report increased unemployment with much irregular short time. In the South-Western Counties employment was slack, but some improvement in the blanket trade took place at Witney. In Scotland, tweed manufacture was quieter at Dumfries and Galashiels. The position in the woollen trade in mid-Wales declined still further.
Hosiery. Very little change took place in this industry and trade was generally quiet with much short-time working. A slight seasonal improvement was reported at Nottingham and Basford.Lace. Employment was bad and trade was generally slack, especially in the Levers&apos; section. The improvement previously reported in the plain-net section was maintained at Beeston.Silk. The slight improvement in this industry was maintained. Employment in the artificial silk section continued good at Derby and Leicester, and improved slightly at Leek.Jute. The position was less satisfactory at Dundee and Arbroath.Carpets. There was a tendency to increased slackness at Kidderminster and some short-time working took place.  At Stroud employment remained good.BUILDING, BRICK AND TILE MANUFACTURE.This trade still remained active and employment was generally good with skilled workers. With unskilled operatives it remained slack, and a slight decline took place in the painting and decorating section. In brick and tile-making employment continued satisfactory.CLOTHING.Seasonal activity in this industry continued at most centres, but some falling off was reported in the&apos; London district, at Bristol and at other centres m the south-Western Counties, except Kingswood and Portsmouth. Employment was also slacker at Leeds.BOOT AND SHOE.Little change took place in this industry and employment was generally quiet with much short-time working. The position improved in the Raunds district, but at most of the other centres in the Midlands, except Stafford and Wolverhampton, emnloymenE declined. At Norwich there was a revival in the light shoe branch. In the Bristol area and at Street (Somerset) short-time working continued. The slipper trade in the Rossendale Valley showed a slight improvement.POTTERY.The improvement in this industry was not maintained and employment was not so good. In the sanitary tile and fireclay sections at Hanley, and also in the first-class china trade at Stoke-on-Trent, employment was good, but short time was worked in the earthernware section.   Trade was satisfactory at Worcester and Bristol.DOCKS.Employment on the whole remained slack. At most of the North-East Coast ports, employment was bad owing to reduction in coal shipments, but some improve-ment occurred at Hull in the unloading of fruit, potato and grain cargoes. In London and at Weymouth and Southampton (where the potato and soft fruit season had started) employment was good. At Bristol employment was quiet, but the position improved at Avonmouth. At the South Wales ports slackness was general. At Liverpool &quot;employment was not so good, but at the Manchester Docks an improvement was caused by heavy imports of timber.

The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; certain schemes put in hand by Government Departments for the same purpose; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method, of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given. In the case of the remaining works the figures are compiled or estimated by the Departments mentioned.It should be noted that in view of recent modifications in the scope of the table the figures given cannot properly be compared with those previously announced in Parliament in similar connections. The figures given for June 1924, which have been prepared (so far as information is available) on the same basis as that now in use, provide an approximately accurate comparison.
IY.-OVERSEAS SETTLEMENT. (Colonial Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed with Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment and should not be so regarded. It should be borne in mind that the excess of the total outward over the total inward movement from this country is somewhat less than 100,000 a year, and therefore small in comparison with the natural increase of population which for many years before and after the war has not been much less than 400,000 a year.The number of persons approved for assistance and the number of departures during the month of May (with the corresponding figures for May of last year) and for the two months ended the Slst May, 1925 and 1924, respectively, are set out in the following Table :  Monthly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The empire settlement Act, 1922.&quot; Approval and Departure Figures.Dominion.Number of Approvals.Number of Departures.Month of May.1925. i 1924.Two months ended May 31.1925.1924.Month of May.Two months ended May 31.1925.1924.1925.; 1924.(1.)

The Scheme, however, closed to new applications in December 1922.

With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summary.

It was followed by the Act of 1916, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory Insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  30,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1924 the rates of benefit were raised (from 15s.) to 18s. a week for men, and (from 12s.) to 15s. a week for women, with 2s. (instead of Is.) a week for each young dependent child. Until the 30th June, 1926, benefit in respect of contributions may be paid for 26 weeks in a benefit year, while benefit, irrespective of contributions, may be paid during unemployment subject to the satisfaction of special conditions. The Act also amends the disqualification for benefit in the case of persons affected by trade disputes, and it abolishes the right to a refund of contributions at the age of 60, subject to the payment of compensation for the loss of refund rights in certain cases.Statement of Income and Expenditure from Armistice to June 27, 1925.Expenditure Benefit paidAppropriation for Administration ....

(C.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn ;i grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment &quot;Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920/21, and the following statement shows the total estimated expenditure by the contributing parties to date and a forecast of expendi-ture during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Year.

Table 4. Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision under the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, of small holdings and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and (b) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs.Settlement through Local Authorities. These schemes are financed by the Exchequer in three ways : (1) by providing through the Public Works Loan Board the necessary capital; (2) by paying each year up to the 31st March, 1926, the loss on Councils&apos; small holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair, as opposed to an economic, rent) so far as such loss has been reasonably and necessarily incurred; (3) by writing-off the difference between outstanding liabilities and the then value of the undertakings at the 31st March, 1926.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since the Armistice a number of properties have been acquired, the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from small holders being borne by the Exchequer. No further properties are being acquired, and it is anticipated that for the future cash receipts will suffice to meet cash outgoings.Land Settlement. (A.) England and Wales.
