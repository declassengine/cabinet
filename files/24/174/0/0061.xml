10HFIDENT!AL LIB Ri 1\4, 1[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. 1Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1925.SECRET. Copy No.   oQCP. 362 (25).CABINET.ELECTRICAL  DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE.Interim Report.AT their meeting on the 28th May, 1925 (Cabinet 27 (25), Conclusion 10), the Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of Transport circulating a copy of the Report of the Committee appointed to review the national problem of the supply of electrical energy, of which Lord Weir of Eastwood was Chairman and the other members were Lord Forres and Sir Hardman Lever, together with a covering letter from Lord Weir (Paper CP. 254 (25)), and agreed : (a.) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows : The Attorney-General (in the Chair), The Lord President of the Council, The Chancellor of the Exchequer, The Secretary of State for War, The Secretary of State for India, The President of the Board of Trade, The Minister of Labour, , The First Commissioner of Works,The Minister of Transport,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport,should report to the Cabinet as to the action to be taken in regard to the Report of Lord Weir&apos;s Committee.(b.) That the Report should not at present be published.2. We have held six meetings and have conferred with Lord Weir, Sir John Snell, Chairman of the Electricity Commission, Mr. Milne Watson, Chairman of the Gas, Light and Coke Company, and Sir Frank Heath, Secretary to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. We now submit to the Cabinet the following conclusions and recommendations reached by us after careful examination of the proposals contained in the Report of Lord Weir&apos;s Committee.3. The Weir Committee were appointed as the successor to a series of Committees which have studied the problem of electricity supply from various angles. The object which the Committee set before themselves was &quot;the reduction in price and the greatest availability of electrical energy to the consumer, ranging from the largest industrial user to the artisan in his home.&quot;4. To attain this object the essential element is to adopt as a basis the largest practical area and to secure that in that area electricity should be generated in a series of comparatively large stations inter-connected with one another and under common management. In Great Britain, the possibility of realising this ideal is complicated by the fact that the electrical industry has grown up on a series of local franchises granting monopoly rights in very limited areas. Hence the problem which faced the Committee was to devise some means of inter-connecting these isolated stations and running the combined system on modern lines.5. The solution which the Weir Committee have put forward is threefold.   In the first place they recommend that a &quot; Gridiron &quot; of interconnecting lines should be set up with the assistance of the State and owned and managed by a body appointed by the State. , Secondly, and as a corollary, they recommend that there [13386]
should be a, standardisation of frequencies. Thirdly, in order to avoid an unwieldy system of State generation throughout the country, they recommend that while the &quot; Gridiron &quot; Board should be empowered to control tlie operation of the selected generating stations, the ownership and working of these stations should remain in the hands of authorised undertakers; and that the electricity so produced should be purchased by the Board at a price sufficient to cover the cost of production, including all amortisation and interest charges, and should be supplied in bulk by the Board at a price which will include the whole costs of the Board to distributing authorities, whose rights of distribution should remain untouched. Owners of selected stations have the option of buying back at the Board&apos;s price or at the actual cost of generation, adjusted to their load factor, whichever is the lower.6. The scheme is based upon technical data which must in the last resort be accepted or rejected on the authority of experts. In this case the authority rests on the highest evidence; the calculations were originally made by Sir John Snell, and were submitted to three of the leading consulting electrical engineers, who not only checked them, but made independent calculations. As a result, we are satisfied that the technical data may be accepted and that the conclusions based upon them are warranted.7. The benefits which the scheme is likely to produce must not be exaggerated. It will not solve the problem of unemployment, though it will directly involve a con-si der able degree of work. Nor will it result in the restoration of any particular industry, because the cost of power is a very small percentage of the total cost of manufacture. Its object is to ensure a supply of power at the lowest possible price, and the adoption of the scheme would reduce the average price of electricity from a present average price of something over 2d. per unit to Id. or less on an estimated consumption of 500 units per head, which at the present rate of increase should be attained in 1940; this represents a difference of  93,000,000 per annum compared with existing prices, and not less than  44,500,000 compared with the lowest possible prices attainable under existing methods. Even on the estimated consumption in 1928, which is the earliest date at which the scheme could come into operation, there is a reduction in price of  16,000,000 per annum.8. We are satisfied that in its broad outlines the scheme is practicable and desirable, and we think that its details should be worked out and embodied in the form of a draft Bill, and that the Ministry of Transport should be authorised to show this draft to interested parties for the purpose of the necessary negotiations.To prevent delajr, it is necessary that a detailed examination to define the exact location and lay-out of the stations should be undertaken at once, and that subse-quently there should be a field survey to decide the route of the lines. Estimates are bcmg made for this work wi,th the consent of the Treasury, though it is not proposed to go beyond the first stage at present.9. To realise the scheme will involve (1) the setting up of a- Central Electricity Board, (2) expenditure of  25,000,000 by the Board spread over ten vears for the erection of the &quot; Gridiron,&quot; and (3) an expenditure of  10,750,000 gross ( 8,500,000 net) spread over four years to accomplish the standardisation of frequencies. We are informed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, provided satisfactory arrange-ments^are made with the Road Fund, he sees no insuperable difficulty in the Treasury guaranteeing the  25,000,000 and lending the  8,500,000.10. The scheme proposed that the amount required for standardisation of frequency should either not be repaid at all or repaid without interest. We differ from this view, and recommend that the whole of the expenditure should be repaid by the Board to the Treasury in twenty years with interest, the latter to run from the date of the advance, but to be capitalised so far as the first two years are concerned. The extra cost spread over the 21,385 millions of units of annual con-sumption is infinitesimal, and we think it undesirable that the scheme should be open to the charge that the electrical industry is being subsidised by the State and so enabled to compete unfairly with rival sources of heat, light and power; further, we think it fair that the cost of producing cheap electricity should be borne by the coiisuniers who profit by it.The expense of changing plant involved in the standardization of frequencies is included in the above-mentioned sum of  10,750,000 and will be met by the Board, which will recover the cost by including it in the price charged to Authorised Undertakings.11. We have given much consideration to the proposals dealing with the erection of new generating stations.    The-Report recommends that this should be left to
authorised undertakers, but that the capital required should be guaranteed by the State. This would involve a guarantee of  100,000,000 over the next fifteen years, which the Treasury are not prepared to accept. We have therefore to consider whether this guarantee was essential and whether without it the inducement was sufficient to insure the erection of the stations by the authorised undertakers. By the scheme the price to be paid is calculated at an amount sufficient to repay the whole cost of production, including amortization and interest at the rate of 6-^ per cent., which would leave a slight margin to the advantage of the undertaker, and the majority of us are of opinion that this fact together with the existing pride in owner-ship and the importance naturally attached to the possession of a station, will be sufficient incentives. While we regard as undesirable the proposal in the Weir Report that the Board should as a last resort themselves have power with the consent of the Commissioners to build and operate stations, we consider that it should be open to the Board to arrange for the extension of existing stations or the erection of new stations by authorised undertakers on the best terms that are from time to time obtainable. We consider, however, that the details of control must be settled by negotiation with the parties concerned, and we recommend that the Minister of Transport should be authorised to commence negotiations on the general lines indicated above, and that if necessary this question should be reconsidered by the Committee.12. The Weir Report recommends certain measures to ensure that the advantages accruing from the &quot; Gridiron &quot; shall be passed on to the consumer. We consider this to be a very important element, and wre are not fully satisfied that the safeguards recommended are sufficient. There should, however, be no difficulty in devising a sliding scale of price and dividend such as is included in the London and Home Counties Order applicable to all undertakings whether concerned with power or distribution or both. We recommend that the Minister of Transport should consider the point in more detail and that the Bill should provide adequate protection for the consumer.13. The Weir Report recommends that the lines and sub-stations of the Board should be exempted from rates.   We are unable to support this recommendation.14. We think it advisable that the Report should be referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence and to the Supply and Transport Committee in view of the fact that the scheme involves the linking up of all generating stations. Subject, however, to the view of these Committees, the scheme appears to us to give the maximum degree of defence against damage to any single station.15. In view of the fact that we are departing in some respects from the recom-mendations of the Weir Committee, and having regard to the disappointments and misunderstandings which would result from the publication of their Report, we recommend that, for the present, the Report should not be published.16. In order that no time may be lost, we recommend that so soon as a Bill has been drafted, we should be authorised to consider the Bill in detail with a view to presenting it direct to the Cabinet. /17. To sum up, we submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet: (1.) That,   subject  to  the  modifications   we  have   suggested,   the  scheme recommended in the Weir Report should be accepted in broad outline, and the details worked out and embodied in a draft Bill. (2.) That the Minister of Transport should be authorised to negotiate with the interested parties.(3.) That the Committee should be authorised to consider the draft Bill in detail with a view to presenting it direct to the Cabinet. (4.) That the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Supply and Transport Committee should be invited to report on the Defence aspects of the Weir Scheme.(5.) That the Weir Report should not for the present be published.Signed on behalf of the Committee,DOUGLAS McGAREL HOGG, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 24, 1925.
