&apos; CONFIDENTIAL LI BRA r ..   203[SIS i)Or^:g?^J^B.,P^g^TY OF HIS BBIMinO MAJESTY&quot;3 MOVEMENT) SECRET- GpIXJO.CP.334-(2g) .CABINET.THE STRATEGICAL MPORTAHCE OE the neutrality Off TANGIER, Hote^bJL the Secretary..1.     On July 6th I v/as asked to circulate to the Cabinetany Reports by the Committee of Imperial Defence relative to the question of the Strategical Importance of the neutrality of Tangier,  (Cabinet 34(25), Conclusion 2).2.     On looking into the matter I find that the reports are so numerous and that the various references to the strategical importance of the neutrality of Tangier are so interwoven with other subjects that it would be more convenient to prepare a brief summery.3.      It is to be borne in mind that our policy in 1904was based on keeping the French off the Mediterraneancoast of Morocco and the Anglo-French Declaration would never have been concluded without the provisions contained therein regarding the Spanish sphere of Influence.4.      The strategical aspect of the status of Tangier was examined.shortly after the War by an interdepartmental committee, the following extracts from whose Report areof interest&quot;As regards the strategic considerations there was no reason to modify the view consistently held by the naval and military authorities, namely,  that the establish^ ment of French authority at Tangier would constitute a. very serious menace to the British position in the Mediterranean in the event of war with Eran.ce.If France were to obtain freedom of action at Tangier, a naval port could be
constructed which would serve as a base for submarines in time of war.    A commercial port would be of little or no use as a base, because it would not contain the necessary shelters for submarines from air attack, or other essential accessories, such as repair shops and supplies.    A civil aerodrome (such as already exists)  could easily be converted into a military aerodrome in tho event of war, but the advantage of France controlling the aerodrome in time of peace would lie in the facilities thus provided for accumulating in advance military stores, such as bombs and petrol, in excess of that required for civil aviation.    In this connection Sir E. White pointed out that there were always large stocks of petrol at Tangier for motor traffic even if the supply at the aerodrome was only sufficient for civil aviationaOn the other hand, if franco were not established at Tangier before the outbreak of hostilities., a. British expedition from Gibraltar could seize the town before any French expedition could arrive&quot;* (C.IJ, Paper 850-B).5.      The matter was summed up by the General Staffin the following extract from the Memorandum dated august 12, 1920:-&quot;Tho -strategical importance of. Tangier to Britain depends on its possible use as a naval or air base by a hostile- Power desiring to control the western entrance to the Mediterranean.    If such a Power were a Mediterranean Power, the British position in the Mediterranean would be very seriously menaced, and tdie effect would extend to our Indian and Eastern Possessions.    The value of Gibraltar to Britain, which already depends largely on the denial of that fortress to a possible enemy, would tend to disappear altogether.It is, therefore, from the British point of view, desirable that no strong lower, and particularly no strong Mediterranean Power, should have sole control of Tangier. Our advantage lies in maintaining Tangier as an undefended port unsuitable for naval use,    This can best be secured by Tangier remaining under the International control - - of France, 8&apos;ocin snd Great Britain&quot;. (C. I. Do Pap or 256-B) .6.     The question was referred to at some length by Jk)rd Curz-on at the Third Meeting of the Imperial Conference of 1223, held on October 5thj in the course of which he
emphasised&quot; the supreme strategical irrportsnco of Tangier to the British Empire and described the negotiations which were then taking place, which led ultimately to the oon-clusion of the Tangier Convention.?.     During those latter negotiations the Foreign Officekept in close touch with the Service Departments.    LordHaldane, however, during his term as Chairman of theCommittee of Imperial Defence,  invited the Staffs of theThree Fighting Services to examine the effect of theTangier Convention from the military point of view.The following extract from the Memorandum of the naval staff shows their views:-&quot;The Admiralty have, therefore, always-taken the view that the fortification of Tangier would be a serious menace to the sea communications of the British Empire owing to its geographical position at&apos; the western entrance to the L&apos;Iediter-ranoan, end that, in consequence, it should not be in the x:ossession of any one Power.The proximity - of Tangier to Gibraltar and the consequent air menace to which the latter place might be exposed from air bases in the Tangier zone was an additional reason for opposing its possession by any one Power&quot;.   (G.I.D. Paper 550-B).The Admiralty then quoted from a letter they had addressedto the Foreign Office on the 26th September,  1S23,(M.01074/23), that &quot;under no circumstances should theTangier zone- be allowed to fall under French control&quot;.The following extract fs?om the views expressed by theGeneral Staff is also of interest:- .&quot;Our chief anxioty about Tangier as a factor in Imperial Defence policy lay in its possible exploitation by a potentially hostile Power as a submarine and aeroplane base.    The provisions of the present Treaty prevent this,  and aro thus satisfactory from the point of view of Imperial Defence&quot;. (C.I.D. Paper 550-B).All three Service Departments considered that the coaclu-sion of the Tangier Convention had secured our position by its provisions for neuti-ality.
0 A p I*G U 0      1Affairs brought the question of Morocco before theCommittee of Imperial Defence in view of the uncertaintiesoccasioned from the evacuation of a large part of theSpanish Zone by the Spanish Army.    G.IVD. P&amp;por 549-B and memoranda were prepared by the Service Departments whichhave a bearing on the Importance of Tangier.    The follow-?ing is an extract from the Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty, dated. January 1st, 1925:-&quot;With reference to tho Foreign Office Memorandum on Morocco of the 19th December, 1924 (C.I.D. Paper He.549-B), it is pointed out therein that our policy in 1904 was based on keeping the French off the Mediterranean coast of Morocco.From the Admiralty point of view, it is even more desirable to-day to endeavour to pursuo the same policy.The security of our Mediterranean trade is certainly not less important to us to-day than it was in 1904.    On the other hand,the development of the various forms of attacking that trade have made it more difficult to effect security.The French established along the coast of - Morocco will in the event of war threaten that security to an even greater degree than at present.    Their present position at Casablanca and along the Algerian coast does not compare in facilities for stopping British trade with a position on the Mediter-ranoan coast of Morocco.&quot;(C* 1.D*Pager 556-3).It will bo noticed that the above extract deals with one&apos;of the points mentioned at the Cabinet, viz. as to whetherthe occupation of the Mediterranean coast of Moroccowould really improve the French position which is soadvantageous already.9*      The General Staff,  in their Memorandum datedand January, .1925, referred more specifically to Tangierin the following extract:-
&quot;French occupation of the Spanish Zone would facilitate a French occupation of Tangier in the event of war.    The posses-sion of Tangier by a hostile Power would, of course,  constitute a very serious menace to our position in the Mediterranean, and if France were prepared to face the possibilities,of action by any other of the Powers, which have guaranteed the neutrality of Tangier, it would probably be impossible for us to prevent such occupation; : it would certainly be very much more difficult than at present.&quot; (0,1.1). Paper-,555-BO .10.    The Air Staff also dwelt on the facilities which France, by acquisition of the Spanish noutral zone, would obtain for seizing Tangier,, in the following terms:-&quot;Further, any extension of French controlled country towards the Tangier Zone, even though not actually adjoining it, definitely reduces the value of its.present international status in that France would more easily be able to violate the Convention and seize Tangier should.she so desirej  in the event -  of war..  The;aerodrome at Tangier, although nominally international, is actually used by a French Aviation Company.The Air,Staff consider, therefore, that the  . occupation by France of the Spanish Zone would &apos;.constitute a definite increase &apos; in the air menace .io- Gibraltar. and over. Mediterranean shipping.    This increase would be particularly marked should. .France bo permitted to enter the country North and Vest of the River Lau.,T (0.1,3). Paper 554-B) .11.    The question of action in the event of an invasion ofthe international zone by Abd-el-ICrim is dealt with in theattached report by the Chiefs of Staff,   (QJ.P, Paper 61-3-B).It will be noticed that the Chiefs of Staff once moredwell on the importance of a&quot; preservation of neutrality inthe Tangier Zone:-&quot;In what we believe to bo the remote event of such a contingency arising, we are of opinion that the preservation of neutrality in the Tangier zone is of stich importance to this country that military action would be necessary&quot;.  (C.I.P. Paper 618-B).12.    It is true that the Chiefs of Staff do not in thotreport dwell on the actual danger of the occupation ofthe Tangier Zone by Abd-el-Xrim1s forces.    It seems fair
to assume, however, that it was in their minds that if Abd-el-Erira. occupied the Zone, the&apos; neutral status to which they attach so much importance would disappear and it is impossible to foretell what would ultimately take its place.13.    The Report of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff was  considered at tho 201st Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on July 1st, 1925, a draft of the Minutes of which was circulated to the Cabinet.    It is sufficient to mention that on that occasion Lord Bectty &quot;emphasised that the need for safeguarding our communication-tions through the Mediterranean was so vital that if the neutrality of the Tangier iione was really threatened it warranted the despatch of two Brigades and a proportion of ancillary troops&quot;.(Signed) M.P.A. JIANEEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens,- S.W.I., 8th July,  1925.&apos;
