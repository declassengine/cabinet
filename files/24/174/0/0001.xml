0 v3 CT CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY.   - -U * I ---- * 8 .[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1925. CP. 301 (25). &quot;1- xAFGHANISTAN.In discussing the question of policy towards Afghanistan (vide CP. 286/25), it will be necessary to take into account the situation created by the action taken by the Italian Government as the result of the execution in Kabul of an Italian subject, Piparno. For the convenience of my colleagues, I accordingly re-circulate tele-graphic correspondence regarding this incident, adding copies of a private telegram giving the views of the acting Governor-General of India and of the Note received by the Foreign Office from the Italian Embassj-. The issues raised, of course, concern the Foreign Secretary equally with myself.With reference to the last paragraph of Sir F. Humphrys&apos; telegram No. 69 of 31st May, the Government of India have been considering the cases of a number of British subjects who were about to cross into Afghanistan. One or two European British subjects who are in the employ of the Afghan Government have been allowed to pass; but the Government of India have issued instructions that a European engineer, with a party of British subjects, who were proceeding to work on the new Legation buildings, should stand fast on the Indian side of the frontier until further orders.India Office, BIRKENHEAD.20th June 1925.Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;&apos;s Minister at Kabul, to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office, dated 3rd June 1925.69. 31st May. Reference my telegram No. 61.. I am informed by Italian Minister that yesterday morning Piparno was secretly retried, sentenced and hanged in Kabul.Tarzi, whom he saw this morning, explained that this deplorable movement had taken place without his knowledge or consent and that he considered himself discredited as Foreign Minister.Salient facts are (a) Afghan policeman was shot dead by Piparno last July ; (b) there has been no fair trial; (c) case was settled in January in accordance with Mahommedan law of retribution when Piparno was handed over to the heirs of the deceased who pardoned him on receiving a substantial sum as blood-money; (d) Piparno was allowed to escape from prison in March and handed himself up six weeks later when close to the Russian frontier.After obtaining summary of the proceedings from my Italian colleague I propose to submit my comments by despatch. Government of India at my request have recently passed orders that no European British subject should be allowed to enter Afghanistan without their sanction. At present, excluding the members of the Legation and engineers employed on new Legation buildings, there is only one such person in Afghanistan.Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office, dated 10th June 1925.74.   10th June.   Reference my telegram No. 69.My Italian&apos; colleague has received orders from Mussolini to present stiff note charging Afghan Government with offences against justice and civilisation.He is authorised to send summary of the proceedings in Piparno case to his French, German and British colleagues.He received yesterday from Afghan Foreign Office copy of the &quot;judgment&quot; extending to 30 pages in Persian, which he thinks is an apologia written subsequent to the execution, rather than the sentence of the Court.Failing receipt of satisfactory reply to his note, which he presents to-day, he considers Italian Legation will probably be withdrawn.I omitted to mention in my telegram No. 69. that Tarzi informed him three days before the execution that he was confident of the prisoners early release.476      100   6.25
I am reserving my comments on this incident and its implications until I have received official summary of the proceedings indicated above.i-   Meanwhile, I would explain that any recommendations which have been made involving the employment of British subjects in any capacity in Afghanistan should, be considered as dependent on receiving such guarantee for their security as His Majesty&apos;s Government may deem appropriate.Since there are indications that Bolsheviks are encouraging a relapse of this country into barbarism, the issues at stake appear to me to be grave and to warrant, most careful consideration.My last interview with Tarzi was on 28th May, since when he has excused himself on the ground of ill-health.Note received by Foreign Office from Italian Embassy 15th June.On 27th July 1924, Dario Piperno, an engineer and Italian subject in Afghanistan, was arrested for having killed an Afghan policeman who wanted to convey him to a police station. He was afterwards condemned to death by the local tribunal as the capitulations were not in force in Afghanistan. Owing to the intervention of the Italian Government the execution of the condemned man was suspended, and in accordance with Mohammedan law the pardon of the heirs of the dead man was obtained by means of the payment of blood-money, which virtually extinguished the capital punishment. As in spite of this Signor Piperno continued to be detained in prison he determined to escape, but, failing to reach the Russian frontier, he gave himself iip again to the A fghan police.On 26th May last the Italian Legation at Kabul received formal assurances in this matter from the Afghan. Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that the case of Piperno had been satisfactorily settled. On the contrary, Signor Piperno was, -on the 2nd instant, executed suddenly by the local authorities without any warning being given to the Italian Minister at Kabul.As the Foreign Office are aware, the representatives of France, Great Britain and Germany then requested the Italian representative in Afghanistan for an account of the Piperno case, and proposed to report to their Governments and to ask them for instructions, with a view to collective representations, in order to learn from the Afghan Government what exactly is(1 the juridical position of foreigners in Afghanistan, and to obtain guarantees which, are at present entirely absent.The Italian Government have instructed their representative at Kabul to furnish his colleagues with the desired information and to address at the same time a formal and solemn protest to the Afghan Government, pointing out to the latter that the Italian Government propose to acquaint them later with their final attitude in regard to the above-mentioned incident.The Italian Government desire to invite the attention of the British Government to the fact that Signor Piperno is the first European to be executed, in Afghanistan, and, moreover, without any legal procedure, and even unknown to his own Legation, which could not remotely expect such a development after the blood-money had been paid, extinguishing the conviction.The Italian Government appreciate the sentiment of unity which inspires the proposal of the British, French and German Legations to make a collective demarche at Kabul in order to obtain guarantees respecting the condition of foreigners in Afghanistan, and they are confident that the respective Governments will&apos; authorise their representatives to carry this step into effect.The Italian Government consider, however, that the negotiations can exert no moral constraint in obtaining guarantees for the future, if the inexplicable action of the Afghan Government in executing Signor Piperno remains without penalty.The Italian Government- have requested that such sanction may consist as follows : (1) That a, public manifestation cf regret, for. the incident be .made at Kabul by the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Italian Legation there, whilst, a company of Afghan soldiers with flag shall salute the Italian flag.(2) That the blood-money paid, in good, faith, but unavailingly, shall be returned.(3; That an indemnity of 7.000L shall be paid to the Italian Government, half of&apos; which shall be paid to Pipernos family and half devoted to beneficent works -   in Italy. - -; ..
It is the intention of the Italian Government to show by the moderation of these demands that they centre all their requirements for moral reparation in the concession which the Afghan Government will have to make. to all the Western Powers of a -statute for foreigners which will be such as to guarantee their existence and activities in Afghanistan.They desire thus to conform to the sentiment of solidarity which the British, French, and German Legations have shown in this matter towards the Italian Legation at Kabul, it being understood, however, that the basis upon whicli the -above-mentioned general demarche is to be founded will be first and foremost a satisfactory settlement of the Piperno incident in accordance with the. very moderate Italian demands.The Italian&apos; Government therefore trust that the British, French, and German Governments will be so good as to associate themselves with the request to the Afghan Government for the early satisfaction of the Italian demands, such step being considered as preliminary to the subsequent collective action directed to ensure future guarantees. The instructions of the three Governments should in this event reach the respective Legations at Kabul as early as possible in order to enable them to take effective steps for the rapid settlement of the Piperno incident.M. Mussolini will be grateful to Mr. Chamberlain if he will be so good as to furnish him with assurances in the matter, having complete confidence that the British Government will support the Italian view and give the necessary instructions to their representative at Kabul.London, 13th June 1925.Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;$ Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office, dated 16th June 1925.75. loth June. Piparno case. My Italian colleague gave me this morning copy of the &quot;Judgment,&quot; with copy of the revised Afghan Code of&apos; Criminal Law, both in Persian, and certified seal of Afghan Foreign Office. lie is doubtful of the accuracy of the translation into French which has been made in his own Legation. I have pressed him for the promised &quot;official summary of the proceedings,&quot; which he hopes to send me this week.He received telegram yesterday from Rome that Mussolini (without waiting for detailed . report) has presented to the Afghan Minister at Rome a note containing concrete demands of the Italian Government. These demands are apparently severe, and there seems to me to be no chance of their being met unless Amir is given the opportunity for saving his face. Italian Minister understands that Mussolini has addressed the British, French and Gerinau Governments on the subject of future guarantees for the security of foreigners in Afghanistan. Tarzi has sent him tinsatisfactoiy reply to note mentioned in my telegram No. 74. As soon as I receive the promised summary I propose to telegraph brief abstract of its contents and of the judgment, in addition to sending my comments with full text by despatch. I hear from trustworthy source that Tarzi has had violent quarrel with the Amir, and has told him that he cannot be responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs if important steps, involving relations with foreign countries, are taken without his knowledge or consent.Telegram from His Britannic Majesties Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office, dated 18t/t June 1925.78. 1.7th June. My telegram No. .75. Mnssolini&apos;s demands, as published in Reuter&apos;s Government summary, which reached Kabul yesterday, are, in my opinion,, too dangerously humiliating to Amir for Afghan Government to accept.My Italian colleague is not sure of the accuracy of his text, and I request that-authentic version may be telegraphed to me at once. Publication of the demands at this stage renders settlement extremely difficult in any case. I have asked for and obtained audience with Amir,for to-morrow and shall endeavour to make him realise that claim of Afghanistan to be considered as a civilised Power is at stake. If Italian Government are prepared to modify their demands, it is possible that the Amir may be persuaded to accept them. If demands, as quoted in Renter, are insisted on, only possible outcome seems to be blank refusal, followed by permanent withdrawal of the Italian legation.
Telegram from His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office, dated 18th June 1925.79. 18th June. Your telegram of the .16th June, part 1 of which not yet-received. I requested my Italian colleague to give me a summary of the proceedings in the Piparno case in order that I might send copy to you with my comments, and obtain your instructions regarding future position of British subjects under Afghan law. I did not, of course, say anything to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government to a collective&apos;-demarche on the subject of guarantees. Any demands for capitulations; would, in my opinion, be rejected, but a fair trial under an intelligible legal code is measure of&apos;security which I consider essential.As regards the Italian note presented at. Rome in Piparno case, I strongly deprecate the association of His Majesty&apos;s Government in demands as published in Reuter&apos;s, which/have been formulated without their concurrence and which, as-they stand, are, I believe,, impossible of fulfilment. I will telegraph more fully on receipt of part 1 of your telegram, and when I have seen the authentic text of. Italian demand.Telegram from Lord Lytton, dated 19th June 1925.Private and personal. Forminka 17. We propose to defer our official comments until Humphrys sends us his report with the further facts he has elicited. I feel, however, I ought to let you have my own provisional views at once.Had the Italian Government consulted us over the Piparno incident, as it was. only natural they should, in view of our long experience of Afghan mentality and our infinitely greater interests, a collective note from IlaLy, ourselves, and presumably France and Germany, might have been possible.   As it is, Italian Government, without consulting us, have not only presented, but published broadcast, demands, which, though possibly suited to Europe, show entire ignorance of Afghanistan, from which they apparently will not be able to resile, and yet have no means of enforcing,, and which Amir will not be able to accept.   If we were to join in a note on the basis of these demands, we should be departing from our fundamental rule of business with Afghanistan, never to present a demand which we believe to be practically impossible of fulfilment.   Such a note, if presented, would probably provoke a storm of anti-European feeling sedulously fomented by Prussia, with Persia and Turkey almost certainly standing out against us.    Its rejection by Afghan Government would necessitate the withdrawal of Italian Legation, and the withdrawal certainly of: our personnel other than Legation and Consular personnel, and in the last resort-of the Legation and Consulates themselves.   Consequences to Italy would be trifling ; indeed, they might almost be welcomed as an opportunity of getting rid of a useless expenditure with a flourish of trumpets.   Consequences to ourselves would be of the gravest, for, if they developed to the worst, Russia would be left in hardly disputed, predominance in Afghanistan.By its precipitate and inconsiderate action Italy has made the position much more difficult for us, though we are infinitely more concerned than they in securing protection for our nationals in future. They cannot, therefore, take it amiss if we decline to follow their lead. Pressing though the need is for us to secure such protection, our best chance to secure it seems to me to lie in calm, deliberate, studiously friendly and, in the first instance at any rate, informal conversations with., the Amir. No doubt Minister would use all his influence to bring home to him gravity of the position from his own point of view, and the impelling need for him. to devise a means whereby he can satisfy ourselves and the conscience of the-civilised world over the trial of our nationals and foreigners generally.I am sending a copy of this to Humphrys.
PRIORITY.June l8th.    Your telegram 17.      All three parts now received including text of demands in Italian note.    Although first demand differs from the version as telegraphed by Reuter, there is,  in my opinion, with which my French and German colleagues agree,  no chance whatever that Afghan Government will -accept it as it  stands.Afghan flag is embroidered with Koranic inscription and has religious as well as national significance.      Grobba also strongly objects to the demand for return of blood-money for reasons which he is telegraphing to Berlin,Tarzi&apos;s reply to first note presented in Kabul by Italian Minister is to the effect that the execution of Piparno was justified under Afghan law and repudiates charge of inhumanity. I submit following observations.(l)    Case has-been complicated from start by pusillanimous and gross mishandling by former Italian Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires who consistently failed to act upon salutary advice of his colleagues.(2)    Conduct of the case by Afghan courts has been contrary to all civilised cannons of justice,(3)    Italian Legation has been treated with shameful discourtesy and (? duplicity) by Afghan Government.(4)    By their precipitate action in formulating and publishing impossible demands without taking advice,  Italian Government have &quot;gravely prejudiced expectation of fulfilmentcopy op telegram:From;    His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul -To:        Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office.Dated   Kabul, through Peshawar, 19th June, 1925-Received 20th June, 1925* 6 ptiru

Whatever outcome of Italian demands may be, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be free to take steps for security of their subjects in their own way and with their own resources.(c) Collective demarche for subsequent guarantee(s) should be treated as separate question to be taken up when various Governments concerned have had time to consider facts and implications of Piparno case.      When I have received His Majesty&apos;s Governments instructions on the proposals which I shall submit with the least possible delay,  it should be possible to devise suitable form of note in conjunction with my European colleagues,,I have impressed upon Chauvet and Grobba vital Importance of refraining from any action which will suggest demands for capitulations, and they propose to consult me before addressing their Governments on subject of future securitycHumphrys 82a
