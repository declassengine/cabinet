CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY,29 9M this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAHITI0 MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.0 A B .1 N E T. (35 ) . SAFEGUARDING OF &apos; INDUSTRIES.SUPERPHOSPHATE. ! -&quot;1 ^Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the Report of the Committee appointed under the terms of the White Paper relating to the Safeguarding of Industries, to enquire into an application made by the Fertiliser Manufacturers&apos; Association, in respect of Superphosphate, together with, a letter from the Chairman.It will be seen that the Committee failed to agree. The Chairman (Sir Arthur Whinney, K.B.E.) found that in View of the use of Superphosphate for agricultural purposes, and in a lesser degree by reason of the volume of employment in the industry, it may be regarded as one of substantial importance; that foreign Superphosphate is being imported into, and retained for consumption in,  the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities,  and that imported Superphosphate is being sold-below the price at which Superphosphate can be profitably produced in the-United Kingdom; that employment has not yet been seriously affected by the foreign competition, but that if present conditions continue   unabated,  the British industry may be brought to a standstill;  that unfair competition does arise in the case of imports from Belgium and Prance (the former being the largest importer) by reason of exchange depreciation operating so as to create an export bounty; that there is no ground for finding that the Industry is conducted otherwise than with reasonable efficiency and economy; and that the evidence available does not suggest that the imposition of a duty on Superphosphate would in itself have
any seriously adverse effeot, at least in the immediate future, on employment in the consuming industry (i.e^agrixjulture^ In these oiroums tances the Chairman, r^eoommends a duty of 7/6d. per ton.The other two members of the Committee, Sir Henry Rew and Mr. Arthur Hollins (Trade Unionist), agree that the imports in 1923 and 1924 were abnormal, but hold that the evidence aa to the present or future effeot of the Imports on employment is inconclusive, but that the effeot is probably small.   As regards the comparison of British and foreign prices they are doubtful about the validity of the figures produced as to British oosts; though on the other hand they admit their inability to fix a figure which would represent the minimum oost of production in this country, and add that they do not regard this of great importance as they are &quot;satisfied that not only at the present time but for many years, extending baok to the pre-lwar period, offers for foreign Superphosphate have been made at prices whioh are deliberately intended to undersell the home manufacturer&quot;.As regards the depreciation of the Frenoh and Belgian currencies, they are not satisfied that it operates so as to create an export bounty on Superphosphate, and ascribe the growth of the.foreign competition to greater alertness on the part of the Belgian, French and Dutoh manufawturers in adapting their works and equipment to post-war conditions.    They admit, however, that many of the British makers have now awakened to the necessity of taking active measures to meet the new conditions, and there are signs that the severity of foreign competition  is lessening^ and that this is due to the stimulus whioh it has given to British makers.In all the ciretimstances they hold that the Applicants have failed to establish a claim to duty.In view of these divergent findings of the Committee, 1 can only recommend that no duty should be imposed.
I shall have to ask the Cabinet to oonsider at an early date the question of whether the publication of reports of committees should be deferred until shortly before the next Finance Bill.    I think it may be desirable to refrain from publishing any reports, favourable or adverse, until near the time when action should be taken, in order to avoid dumping. I propose that the question of publication of this particular report should, if possible, be deferred, until we can discuss the general question.As regards the proposal of a subsidy made in the Chairman&quot; letter, consideration of thi3 had better perhaps be deferred until the Civil Research Committee has made its report on matters arising out of the iron and steel application.    If, however, apart from the adverse effect on agriculture, there is no claim to a duty, it is difficult to see how a claim to a subsidy oan be  justified.P. C-L.Board of Trade13th July,  1925.
SAFEGUARDING   OF    INDUSTRIES. SUPER PH OS PRATE C OMMITTEE.REPORTBY SIR ARTHUR WHINNEY, K.B.E,  (CHAIRMAN)TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR PHILIP   CUNLIFFE-LISTERfK.B.E., M.C., M.P.PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE.SIR,The Committee were appointed by you to enquire into and report upon the application made by the Fertiliser Manufacturers&apos; Association, Limited, in accordance with the terras of the White Paper relating to Procedure and Enquiries in connection with the Safeguarding of Industries presented to Parliament on 3rd February, 1925, for the imposition of a duty upon superphosphate.INTRODUCTION.2.   The Committee have held eleven meetings and have heard evidence (on two occasions in camera) from, in all, twenty witnesses.     The Statistical Department of the Board of Trade also furnished thera with valuable Memoranda dealing with statistical matters upon which they desired information.3.    The Fertiliser Manufacturers&apos; Association, Limited, comprises,  the Committee were informed, all save one of the makers of superphosphate in Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, numbering some eighty-five members. The firm excepted Is understood not to be at the moment manufacturing superphosphate.     Most of the constituent firms are engaged in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, of other fertilisers In addition to superphosphate and of other materials.     This cause has contributed to the difficulties of obtaining from the Industry accurate statistics relating solely to superphosphate.
4.   The Applicants were represented by Counsel, Sir H. Cassie Holden, Bt,      In opposition the National Farmers&apos; Union were represented at the first public sitting by Counsel,iMr. A.M. Trustram Eve.     At subsequent public sittings they were represented by their Solicitor, Mr. Alfred Ellis of Messrs. Ellis &amp; Fairbairn, who, on and after the third public sitting, also represented the National Farmers1 Union-Of Scotland and the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union in opposition to the Application.5.   The Committee desire to testify to the great assistance rendered to them by the legal representatives of the Applicants and of the Farmers&apos; Unions.     They also emphasise the importance of all who submit precis of evidence being prepared to substantiate from personal knowledge the statements made therein,6.   Evidence was tendered to the Committee at its publicsittings by the following witnesses in support of theApplication:-Mr. J.C. Menzies,    President of the FertiliserManufacturers&apos; Association Limited.Mr. A.N. Gray, Manager and Joint Secretary ofthe Fertiliser Manufacturers&apos;Association Limited. Mr. W.G.T. Packard,-Director of Messrs. Packardsand Jas . Flson (Thetford) Limited. Mr. H.W. Brown,       Accountant of Messrs. J. &amp; J.Cunningham, Limited. Col, R.L. Norrington, Director of Messrs. CharlesNorrlngton and Company, Limited, and   Mr. R. Waterfall,    Managing Director of the AvonManure Company, Limited.and in opposition by -Mr. G.

Guild, Secretary and StatisticalOfficer of the National Farmers1 Union.The evidence of the opponents was directed to the effect on agriculture of a tariff on superphosphate, to the questions of efficiency and economy in the Industry, and to rebuttal of evidence given on behalf of the Applicants.7. Superphosphate of lime is manufactured for use as a fertiliser for application to agricultural., land by treating finely ground phosphate rock (phosphate of lime) with sulphuric acid, approximately 10 cwts, each of rock and acid being consumed in the production of 18 cwts. of superphosphate.     The product is made and sold in this country mainly of 30 per cent, and 35 per cent, strength. The percentage Indicates the proportion of phosphate, calculated as tri-basic calcium phosphate, which has been rendered soluble in water.For the sake of convenience,.prices and costs in this Report refer exclusively to the 30 per cent, grade.8. The raw materials phosphate rock and pyrites are imported, the former principally from Northern Africa and the United States of America, the latter from Spain, Portugal and Norway,     A tabular statement of the imports of phosphate rock is given in the Appendix,     A small, but unknown, proportion of the imports is understood to be applied direct to the land in a pulverised condition and to be consumed in the manufacture of commodities other than superphosphate.9. The Applicants based their claim for some measure of safeguarding upon the abnormally large imports of
superphosphate said to have occurred during recent years from continental countries, more particularly Belgium, where manufacturers were alleged to have the advantage of a bounty consequent on a depreciated exchange, and of inferior conditions of remuneration of labour.     The evidence of foreign conditions submitted in support of the claim was, in the main, in respect of Belgium.10. It was represented to the Committee that the adverse effect of this competition is such as to involve the British industry in heavy financial losses and threaten it with ultimate extinction.11, In order to arrive at an opinion on the merits of the claim thus advanced the Committee directed their enquiries in accordance with the several headings of Section II of the White Paper already referred to in paragraph 1.12. They regret that they were unable to arrive at unanimousconclusions on fll the questions before them.My conclusions in respect of each heading, togetherwith a summary of the reasons leading to those conclusions,are as follows:-(1) WHETHER THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY IS, BY REASON of the VOLUME OP EMPLOYMENT ENGAGED IN THE PRODUCTION OP THE GOODS TO WHICH THE APPLICATION RELATES, OR BY REASON OP THE NATURE OP THE GOODS PRODUCED, AN INDUSTRY OP SUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE.(a) Volume of employment.13. With regard to the number of employees engaged in themanufacture of superphosphate, evidence was tendered by theapplicant Association, said to be based on a census ofhands taken during the year 1923, which indicated 17,000employees.   The output of superphosphate during the year in question, ending June 30th, 1923, was 550,274 tons.    On
the diminished production,  since that date it was estimated by the Association that some 16,500 men were now employed in the industry directly on the manufacture of superphosphate and the necessary acid.    It was later elicited that 16,500 did not represent men employed continuously throughout the year but that probably only three-quarters of this number would represent the volume of regular employment.14.   The dommittee were informed that should the pre-war output of superphosphate follow the imposition of a tariff the number of men likely to be employed would r^ise to about 27,000, estimated to have represented the volume of employment in the year to June,  1914.15.   Prior to the first public meeting the attention of the Committee had been directed to the Final Report on the First census of production of the United Kingdom (1907) wherein the total number of wage earners and salaried persons engaged in the fertiliser, glue,  sheep-dip and disinfectant trades in the United Kingdom is given as 12,444,  or of wage earners only 10,802.   From a comparison of the net output of the whole of these trades with that of the superphosphate, division of the fertiliser trade it was possible to deduce that an average of between 2,500 and 3,000 persons were employed in 1907 in the manufacture of 605,000 tons of super-phosphate, on the basis of continuous whole-time employment..16.   The volume of present employment claimed by the Applican-seemed to the Committee,  in the light of these figures,  to be so greatly exaggerated that the discrepancy was brought to their notice.17.   A census of employees was accordingly taken by the Applicants during the course of the sittings.     Returns were obtained from manufacturers of superphosphate representing 65 per cent,    of the output of the year ending
June, 1924, and by raising the number of employees shown by the returns on a proportionate basis to 100 per cent, it was calculated by the Apllicants that the whole output of that year represented an average number of 5,550 hands employed throughout the, year.     This was then put forward by the Applicants as their amended figure for the average volume of employment at the present time.     The actual weekly figures put forward varied between about 4,350 and somewhat over 7,500.18.   The Committte required to know how it was that the original figure of 17,000 placed before the Board of Trade and before them was put forward as based on a census of hands taken by the Association in 1923.No satisfactory explanation was given.19.   It did not appear to me that even the figure of 5,550 was reliable,   I am of opinion after a careful review of the evidence given by the Applicants as to output per man in the home Industry and in the Belgian factory under their control, and of similar evidence received with regard to superphosphate factories in Holland,  that a figure of at most 3,300 men rather than 5,550 probably represents the average total volume of employment,  inclusive of clerical labour,  at present engaged solely or mainly in connection with the manufacture of superphosphate and the necessary acid.   A larger figure would appear to appoint to low average efficiency.20.   In comparing this figure with that deduced from the Report on the Census of Production (1907) it may be pointed out-that the latter refers to a time prior to the introduction of labour-saving machinery on any appreciable scale, and it is rather to be expected that the figure   at the present day, even allowing for reduced working hours, would not be in excess of the figure in 1907.
21. The figures which have been discussed above refer to the whole of Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State     The output of superphosphate in Great Britain and Northern Ireland during the calendar year 1923 was four-fifths of the total production by the members of the Association. Using the proportionate method employed by the Applicants In arriving at their figure of 5,550, one-fifth, or 660 men, must be deducted from the figure of 3,300 in paragraph 19 in order to arrive at an approximation to the volume of employment, 2,640 men, in that portion of the Industry carried on in Great Britain and Northern Ireland with which alone the Committee are concerned.(b) Nature of the goods produced.22. With regard to the importance of the goods produced by the superphosphate industry, evidence was given indicating the importance of superphosphate to the agricultural industry in the production of barley and other grain, root crops and potatoes.    It was indicated, however, that on certain classes of land superphosphate did not give altogether desirable results, and further, that other fertilisers, such as basic slag, could at times be substituted.23, The Departmental Committee on the Post-^ar Position of the Sulphuric Acid and Fertiliser Trades which reported in 1919, stated that the agricultural experts consulted by them were unanimous in the view &quot;that very considerably Increased fertili-sat ion of the soil by means of superphosphate is not only possible but Is highly desirable in the national interest&quot;.24. Evidence was also furnished by the. Applicants by way of reference to the Report of the Committee in question, indicating the importance of the superphosphate industry to the country in time of war  as having been a consumer in pre-war days    of 30 per cent, of the total sulphuric acid.
output of the country.   Almost all of the acid thus consumed was it Is understood produced by the super-phosphate makers themselves.   Sulphuric acid was used In the war In the manufacture of nitric acid and of explosives.25. The proportion of the sulphuric acid plant operated by the superphosphate manufacturers    to the total sulphuric acid plant available in the country is still probably of the same order as before the war., apart from a small diminution in the proportion consequent on the limited production of sulphuric acid as a by-product of the zinc-smelting industry. New methods for the manufacture of nitric acid which, however, are understood to be coming into operation may render the use of sulphuric acid in the manufacture of nitric acid unnecessary, and to that extent reduce the importance of the Industry in the manufacture erf an important raw material for the production of explosives.     Sulphuric acid will still be required in the manufacture of explosives themselves,26. Whilst attaching some importance to the Applicants&apos; evidence on this matter I consider that the need of the country in time of war is a question which is bound up with a very much larger one than that which falls within the scope of the Committee^ enquiry.   To consider fully the matter from this point of view would be to open the door to a very wide field of Investigation involving questions of policy applicable not only to the applicant Industry but to many others which may be engaged on the production of materials of importance in time of war.27., On the whole I am inclined to the opinion that in view of the, use pf superphosphate for agricultural purposes, and in a lesser, degree by reason of the
9 n o kidvolume of employment in the Industry,, the superphosphate industry may be regarded as an industry of substantial importance.(2)   WHETHER FOREIGN GOODS OF THE CLiSS OB DESCBIPTION TO WHICH THE APPLICATION RELATES ARE BEING IMPORTED INTO AND BETAINSD FOB CONSUMPTION IH THE UNITED KINGDOM IN ABNORMAL QUANTITIES.28.   It appears to me that abnormal quantities within the meaning of this heading of the White Paper may be judged either by comparison of the ratios of retained imports to home produotion in the year 1913 and during the year 1924, or by comparison of the ratios of retained imports to the total home consumption of superphosphate in the years in question.29.   The following table indicates the imports of super-phosphate for the years 1910-13, and for the years 1930-24. For comparative purposes the foreign imports of the Irish Free State are included with those of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.     Information is not available as to the imports for pre-war years comparing with those at the present time in respect only of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.     For the pre-war years the figures are based on the official returns of the exporting countries.pntry oftaientT1910;    1911i 1918Tons I   Tons j Sons1913192019211922 !    1923! 1924piuin ....q9 ... . .fL9,600 1,40029,100 j28,8003,900inlands.7,800115,800 8001     500tils.29,600 i49,3003,100 16,6001.600^ons 39,000 900 23,0001.000Tons 1,8764403,33250,100163,90015,648Tens 38,124 444 3,88521242,665&quot;Tons&quot; j   Tons   Tons36,767 3,458 4,8862,30847,41975,200 11,409 33,20012,991332,80062,300 39,275 32,80015.325049,700Re-export3 hare always, it is understood, been of negligible dimensions (10 tons in 1920, nil in 1921 and

The figures of output in the above statement are derived primarily from the International Year Boole of Agricultural Statistics.     Evidence put before the Committee by the Applicants based on actual returns from the constituent members of their Association indicates that certain of the published figures are probably incorrect.   For the years 1921, 1922 and 1924, the figures given in evidence have been aooepted and adjusted to the basis of the oalendar year.32.   it will be seen that the average annual quantity of retained imports in the four years 1910 to 1913 vias 48,200 tons and in the four years 1921 to 1924, 93,100 tons.   In both periods the quantity increased progressively but whereas in the former period the Imports doubled in 4 years in the latter period they more than trebled.     It is to be noted that whereas the imports from Belgium, of *hich the
Applicants, chiefly complained,, have increased since 1921 by 63 per cent, those from the Netherlands have increased by over 700 per cent.   There is no evidence of abnormal imports until after 1922, but there was a very markedly increased influx in 1923 which was not materially augmented last year.   The Trade Returns for the first four months of the present year, 1926, show a slight decrease as compared with the corresponding period of last year.33.     A comparison of the ratios of retained imports to home output during the years 1913 and 1924 shows that the latter ratio is 3.5 times the former.A like comparison of the ratios of retained imports to home consumption indicates that the ratio for 1924 is 2.8 times that for the earlier year.34.     I find on the evidence before me that foreign superphosphate is being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.(3) WHETHER   THE FOREIGN GOODS SO IMPORTED ARE BEING SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AT  PRICES WHICH ARE BELOW THE PRICES AT WHICH SIMILAR GOODS CAN BE PROFITABLY MANUFACTURED OR PRODUCED IN THE &apos; UNITED KINGDOM.35.     As evidence of the price at which foreign superphosphate is being offered for sale or sold in this country the Committee were furnished with a number of quotations for delivery of superphosphate during the early months of -the present year varying from  2. 11. 0 to  2. 18. 0 net c . i.f. British port.   The majority of the offers were in the neighbourhood of the higher limit.    Information obtained by the Committee from H .M. Customs regarding the value of the imports of superphosphate during the recent months, January to April, appears to substantiate these
figures, so far at lea6t as imports from Belgium and Prance are concerned.   Those from Holland show an average value of slightly over  3 per ton.   To the quotations of  2.11.0 to  2,18,0 should be added, the Applicants stated, 3/*- to cover the cost of discharging from the vessel and loading on to rail, in order to render the quotations comparable with the British makers&apos; quotations f,o.r, at works.   The values of the imports supplied by H.M. Customs are it is understood, also as a rule c.i.f. values. To these values 3/-  mast, as a consequence, also be added to bring the value to a f.o.r. figure.36.     The evidence available points, therefore, to the offer of foreign superphosphate at prices f.o.r, British port varying from  2.14.0 to approximately  3.5.0 per ton, with a leaning towards the higher figure.37.    With regard to the cost of manufacture of superphosphate in the United Kingdom the Committee were furnished with evidence of costs said to represent the average of those of four typical firms for the year 1923-1924, the latest period for which figures were available.   These indicated that  3.8.Id per ton f.o.r. works was the average cost of production38.     The Committee required that the figures of cost should be brought into line with the financial accounts of the companies concerned.   This resulted in the costs being in each ease raised, owing to inclusion of high-priced contracts from the previous year and other causes, the average thereby becoming  3. 11. 9d per ton.   The Applicants did not desire, however, to raise the figure initially put forward and adhered to  3.8.1d as the actual average cost of manufacture.39.   The Committee were not satisfied, however, that this
e% n r\figure sufficiently represented the average cost throughout the Industry, and accordingly called for the cost records and the financial accounts of further companies to be placed before them.    In all an additional seventeen&quot; firms making 30 per cent, superphosphate responded.40.    In the case of twenty-one firms whose output of superphosphate of all grades In the year 1923-1924 amounted to one third of the total output of the Industry the evidence indicates that the average cost of production of ^0 per cent, superphosphate during the year in question based on the certified accounts, was  3.8.81. per ton. Inasmuch as profitable manufacture connotes not merely manufacture at cost of production, a profit upon such costs has to be contemplated,41,    I have no reason to suppose that the average cost of production of the twenty-one firms is otherwise than representative of costs of production as they at present exist throughout the British Industry,4is, Seeing that foreign superphosphate is being offered for sale at prices ranging between  2,14.0. and  3,3,0. per ton, and that the cost of production of home-manufactured superphosphate is  3,8.8. per ton (exclusive of profit), I find that imported superphosphate is being sold or offered for sale below the price at which superphosphate can be profitably produced in the United Kingdom.
ft oti 3 Dworkers and the highest paid.    In this country they work in factories.   We were informed that in.Italy, Belgium and other countries they mainly work in their own homes.   Not only, therefore, do foreign manufacturers benefit by the longer hours presumably worked by these home workers but they do not need such large factories for their workers and their overhead expenses are thereby reduced.We were assured that goods are occasionally forwarded to the British market from these countries at prices below the cost of production in the country of origin.    This applies particularly to fabric gloves.(f) we would draw attention to the following extract from paragraph 15 (lii) of the Report of the Committee appointed underthe Safeguarding of Industries Act, 1921,&quot;Evidence was submitted to us to the effect that &quot;the manufacture of fabric gloves in this country is &quot;now being carried on mainly by means of an export &quot;trade to the British Dominions where German goods &quot;are unable to compete, either because, as in &quot;Australia, of an embargo upon their introduction, or, &quot;as In Canada, by fiscal arrangements which neutralise &quot;theeffect of the disturbed exchange.   In the event &quot;of a change in these conditions the present market &quot;for English-made goods would be greatly restricted &quot;and further unemployment in- the industry would be &quot;created&quot;.It is clear that the prediction made by this Committee has now been amply fulfilled.(g) By reason of the fact that foreign manufacturers need not stamp gloves with the country of origin unless a British trade mark or name of a firm Is on the glove, we are of opinion that many persons are buying foreign gloves under the impression that they are British,   We have seen examples of leather gloves on which words such as &quot;Real Cape&quot; are   stamped on the domes or buttons.   This alone would tend to convey to the customer that the glove Is British, and, our manufacturers are thereby prejudiced.   We are informed that it is a common practice to insert the country of origin on the paper bands round the gloves or on the boxes containing them.   The Joint Industrial
i278(4)  WHETHER, BY REASON OP THE SEVERITY AND EXTENT OF SUCH COMPETITION, EMPLOYMENT IN THE MANUFACTURE OR PRODUCTION OF SUCH GOODS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS BEING, OR IS LIKELY TO BE, SERIOUSLY AFFECTED.43. The Committee were furnished with no evidence that the number of employees in the superphosphate industry had declined during the recent years of abnormal importa-tion.    They were asked to infer this from the reduced output,44, Reference to the tabular statement in paragraph 30 shows that the annual consumption of superphosphate has decreased between 1913 and 1924 from approximately 807,000 tons to 678,000 tons.    The home output in the latter year . was nearly 534,000 tons, so that on the basis of the consumption in 1924 - apparently a fair figure for the post-war years - an increase of at most 144,000 tons in the output of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and the Irish Free State might be expected if all imports were prevented.    Approximately one-fifth of this would, the evidence indicated, be referable to the Irish Free State. A tariff sufficient only to countervail the unfair competition would probably not result in entire exclusion of imports end the maximum Increase of the home output indicated above would not be reached.45,   There was no evidence to suggest that the pre-war consumption would follow even entire exclusion of imports. 46,    If the whole of the 144,000 tons at present manufac-tured abroad were produced here it appears reasonable to assume on the evidence before the Committee that possibly
as many as 200 to 300 additional men might be employed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland,This number appears to me to represent the maximum reduction of employment in the superphosphate Industry which can possibly be due to the abnormal imports.47.As to whether employment &quot;is likely to be seriously affected&quot; through abnormal importation, there is little evidence.     The latest available figures of imports do not suggest that the rate of importation during 1924 is being accelerated.48. It has been suggested to the Committee that the export market, save for possible new outlets, is almost entirely lost.     If this were so, it might well be that a continuance of the abnormal imports would ultimately seriously affect the output of the home article and employment in the Industry.      In view, however, of the large and increasing export trade in superphosphate done by countries such as Holland, Belgium and Prance, I am not convinced that the export market has vanished past recall,  and that it might not prove practicable for the home manufacturers to place superphosphate on foreign markets at a competitive price.     Should this prove to be the case, any excessive imports in the future would be of comparatively small moment in the reduction of the volume of employment.49. I am of opinion that employment has not yet been seriously affected by foreign competition resulting from the abnormal Importation of superphosphate, but I think it probable that if present conditions, arising from such foreign competition, continue unabated,  the British Industry may be brought to a standstill, with a consequent increase in unemployment.     On the other hand the British
i280British manufacturers may be able to save the position by recap buring the export market, aid thus give a larger employment to labour.(5)  WHETHER SUCH EXCEPTIONAL COMPETITION COMESLARGELY FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THE CONDITIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THIS COUNTRY AS TO RENDER THE COMPETITION UNFAIR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE OP.ERATION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING CAUSES (a),  (b) AND (c).(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to create an expert bounty. 50.    It was suggested to the Committee, in their considera-tion of the question of whether unfair competition arises in the Superphosphate industry through the depreciation of the foreign exchange operating so as to create an export bounty that it was sufficient to show that the cost to the British manufacturer was above the actual cost, without profit, of foreign superphosphate delivered in this country, expressed in sterling at the current rate of exchange.     The difference was alleged to represent an export bounty in favour of the foreign manufacturer.51.    I was unable to accept this view.    It appeared to me that an export bounty would only arise itfhen the equivalent of the   sterling converted into foreign currency at the ruling rate of exchange exceeded the internal v value or purchasing power of the % sterling when converted into the currency of the country of export.52.    In the case under review the Applicants were in a position to produce, aid did, in fact, submit a statement of the cost of production of superphosphate in Belgium, and they put forward a series of calculations showing that an export bounty arose by a comparison of:
(a) that part of the coat of manufacture of foreignsuperphosphate expended within Belgium converted into sterling at the purchasing power parity of the   sterling,and(b) the same cost converted into sterling at the rulingrate of exchange. They claimed that the amount by whioh (a) exceeded (b) would constitute the sterling value of a bounty to the Belgian manufacturers exporting superphosphate to this country,53. The applicants  calculations rested upon a purchasing power parity of the   sterling of 70,27 Belgian francs and an average rate of exchange of 96.75 francs, from which they deduced that a bounty of approximately 7s,4d. per ton existed in the case of Belgium.     Similar calculations were submitted by them in the case of Prance, which disclosed that a bounty of 6s.9d, per ton was operative in favour of French exporters.54. Mr. J.B. Guild, the expert witness put forward by the National Farmers&apos; Union, put the export bounty In the case of Belgium at 4s.2d, per ton based upon retail prices of commodities.     He stated that If wholesale prices were adopted as the basis of calculation, the export bounty would be 3s.2d. per ton.   His opinion favoured the latter calculation.     He also claimed that even admitting that a bounty existed, the Applicants had not established that such bounty was operative in the case of the superphosphate industry.55.    I am of opinion that it is overstraining the case to attempt to draw a distinction between the superphosphate
industry as carried on In Belgium and Prance and the whole industrial conditions obtaining in those countries, for the reason that those general conditions necessarily influence the elements in the cost of production of superphosphate in those countries.56,   Since the Applicants were before the Committee, the exchange with Belgium and France has further depreciated. This has the effect of disturbing the Applicants&apos; calculations. In ray opinion It is not practicable to measure the exact amount of bounty by working out figures which rest on unstable factors.     The conclusions drawn therefrom will be upset as conditions change.     Nevertheless, the weight of evidence, in my opinion, lends support to the view that an export bounty exists in the case of Belgium and France, and as a consequence, I find that depreciation in exchange has conferred and is conferring a benefit on the Belgian and French manufacturers, but that such benefit or bounty is impossible of exact measurement by reason of the mutability of the factors from which it must necessarily be deduced.     It varies as the rate of exchange rises or falls in relation to the cost of living in the countries concerned.57. I have arrived at the conclusion that unfair competition does arise in the case of imports of super-phosphate from Belgium and France by reason of the depreciation of exchange operating   so as to create an export bounty.) Subs idles, bounties, or other artificial advantages,.58.   No satisfactory evidence was placed before the Committee indicating the existence of unfair competition in the manufacture of superphosphate consequent on the operation of any of the causes of this sub-heading,
I am of opinion that no auoh unfaix competition has been proved to arise.(o) Inferior conditions of employment of labour. 59.   With regard to the unfair competition said to arise as the ,outcome of inferior conditions of remuneration in Belgium and Prance the Committee have not deemed it necessary, or within the scope of their enquiry, to conduct extended investigations into the conditions under which workmen in Belgium and Prance live.     I have no reason to suppose the conditions to be inferior to those in the United Kingdom.bb,   No. evidence was adduoed which suggested that the remuneration received by the workers in the countries in question Is substantially less than that accorded to the British worker taking into account the internal value and purohasing power of the franc.     Expressed in other words, the evidenoe showed that the Belgian and French workman is working at a much lower rate of remuneration than that of the British worker, but there is nothing to indicate that his standard of well-being is otherwise than is compatible with the conditions which obtain in the United Kingdom..61. I am of opinion that unfair competition does notarise from any inferior conditions of employment of labour..(6) WHETHER THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY IS BEING CARRIED ON IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WITH REASONABLE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY.62.    The evidence which was placed before the Committeeon the question 9f efficiency went to show a considerabledifference between the soale of manufacture adopted bythe British makers of superphosphate and by those on the
continent, at least as regards Holland.63.    It was proved that the Dutch manufacturers were connected together into a combine which controls all manufacture in Holland with the exception of that by a co-operative farmers&apos;  factor.y and a small works in the south of Holland stated to be Prenoh-owned.    The works are modern and equipped with labour-saving devices and are mainly situated so as to secure the advantage of deep waterways, thus facilitating a large export trade.04.    The Belgian manufacturers also, by reason no doubt of the effect of the War, - have the advantage of modern equipment.65.    The British manufacturers of superphosphate, however-, are possessed of factories which have grown up haphazard and are designed mainly to satisfy local demand.    Although many are equipped with modern maohinery, the probability is that capital outlay incurred in the past coupled with unprofitable production has, in many instances, militated against the installation of up-to-date machinery and has thus placed the British manufacturer at some comparative disadvantage.66. Viewed as a whole, I am of opinion that, notwith-standing these disadvantages there is^ no ground.....forfinding that the Industry is conducted otherwise than with reasonable efficiency and economy.67.    I am disposed to think that if conditions are such that in future the Industry can be conducted upon favourable terms the British manufacturer will be plaoed in a position to compete with the continental manufacturer in. the export market. . This should enable him not only to give some larger volume of employment in this country but, by reason of the fact that his plant will be more
m o cfully occupied, also to reduce the cost of his manufacture and consequently sell more cheaply to the consumer.(7) WHETHER THE IMPOSITION OP A DUTY ON GOODS OF THE CLASS OR DESCRIPTION IN QUESTION WOULD EXERT A SERIOUSLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT IN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY, BEING AN INDUSTRY USING GOODS OP THAT CLASS OR DESCRIPTION IN PRODUCTION.68.   Superphosphate Is consumed exclusively in theagricultural industry and in the mixed fertiliser Industry,in which latter it is mixed with other fertilisers forsale as compound fertilisers.    It is only with thequestion of possible unemployment in these industries,therefore, that the Committee are concerned, and in bothit would appear to be bound up with the question of apossible decrease in consumption of superphosphate inagriculture.69.    The Committee were assured by the Applicants that the imposition of a duty on superphosphate would not cause a rise in the current price of that commodity of more than ten shillings per ton above the average selling price now current of  3 per ton, to merchants, and they were willing to have safeguards exacted to that end.   With such a maximum increase, the extra cost to the farmer per acre in the case of crops requiring a dressing of 6 cwts. per acre, the largest dressing suggested as usual by a witness who is a very large consumer, would be 3/- per dressing, a comparatively small fraction of the average value of the resulting crops.    It was admitted by the agricultural witnesses who appeared before the Committee that an increase in the price of superphosphate alone up to 10/- per ton would not in itself, at least so far as they were concerned, result in arable land being given over to grass.
70,   In so far as a low price is a requisite to the continued and extended use of chemical fertilisers, the higher price suggested would interfere with consumption of superphosphate, agricultural progress would be hindered and employment somewhat affected.    I am of opinion that the psybhological effect of a rise in price, however small the effect per acre may be, cannot be ignored, as it may reduce consumption and help forward the existing tendency of reversion of arable land to grass.   The cultiva-tion of arable land involves the employment of considerably more labour than that of grass land, and to that extent a reversion to grass land would involve a gradual decrease in employment.7x.    A review of the evidence available ddes not suggest that imposition of a- duty on superphosphate would bave. in ^itself, any seriously adverse effect, at lease in the immediate future, on employment in, the Consuming industries.(8) WHETHER, HAVING REGARD TO THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY HAS, IN THE OPINION OP THE COMMITTEE, ESTABLISHED A CLAIM TO A DUTY; AND, IP SO, WHAT RATE OR RATES OP DUTY, IN THE OPINION OP THE COMMITTEE, WOULD BE REASONABLY SUFFICIENT TO COUNTERVAIL THE UNFAIR COMPETITION.72.    I am of opinion that having regard to my findings in frespect of the previous headings a case for a duty has been established.-73.    The Committee were invited to recommend that a prohibitive duty of  1 per ton should be levied on imported superphosphate, a recommendation Vihihh they have no power to mfike.    It was also suggested that in the event of such a duty being recommended they should
further recommend that the price of superphosphate should he regulated by a Government Department or other similar means.   I make no recommendation, however, on this suggestion as it is not within the soope of the enquiry. The fact that any duty imposed would be for a limited period appears to me to afford some safeguard against an unwarraiitable rise in price, as it gives the opportunity of removing the duty should circumstances make it desirable.74.   I rule out, therefore, the claim for a prohibitive duty and the accompanying price safeguard suggested, and confine myself to the consideration of the rate of duty which will be reasonably sufficient to countervail the unfair competition arising from the export bounty conse-quent upon the depreciation of currency, and irrespective of the competition whioh may be said to arise from the lower rate of remuneration whioh the Belgian or Frenoh worker is understood to receive.75.   Competition undoubtedly arises from many oauses. Lower rates of wages do not necessarily import inferior conditions of employment.   Higher rates of port and landing charges on raw materials entering the United Kingdom may also be factors in competition.   None of these conditions, however, render the competition unfair within the meaning of the white paper.    They all seem to arise from the fact that the foreign worker is willing to accept a lower rate of remuneration for his services than the British worker.76.   The unfair competition which I find to exist arises from the export bounty created by the depreciation of
the Belgian ana. French currency.   Such competition can in my opinion be met under existing oirountBtances, by the imposition of a countervailing duty of 7s. 6d. per ton, and L. suggest that suoh duty shall be imposed for a period of two years *77.   I desire to testify to the very valuable assistance rendered to the Committee by its Secretary, Mr.W.H.L-Patterson, who by his zeal and ability and by the readiness with which he has oollated statistical and other information has lightened the work which has arisen in the course of a some-what diffioult and involved enquiry,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,ARTHUR WHTNNEY (Chairman)W.H.L.

REPORTBY SIR HENRY HEW, K.C.B., and MR. ARTHUR H01LIN8, J.P. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTBR, K.B.B.,M.C., M.P. PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE.SIR,We regret that we are unable to sign the ChairmanTs Report, in the Preparation of a large part of which we collaborated and with much of whioh we agree.   From its main conclusion we dissent and we propose to confine our Report to those points whioh we desire especially to emphasise.2. The case was ably presented to us   by the Counsel for the applicants but the oomplete breakdown, and ultimata withdrawal, of the very explicit statements as to the labour employed in the Industry, made in the first instance to the Board of Trade and subsequently to the Committee, could not fall to make ua oautious in accepting at their faoe value other figures unless vouched for by an individual witness from his personal knowledge.     The original statement that 17,000 hands were direotly employed in the Industry and that this figure was based on a &quot;census of hands employed&quot; taken by the Applicants, was. Ween challenged, completely abandoned and the figure of 5,550 substituted.   We agree with the Chairman that even this figure oannot be accepted as trustworthy and that the average number of men employed in the Industry In Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the present time probably does not exceed 3,000.   If thtre vere no imports the additional number employed, assuming that the demand for superphosphate remained constant, would on this basis be not more than 300.
n a3. Records of the number of men discharged In a given period either, by the members of the Fertilizer Manufacturers1 Association Limited collectively, or at least by some of them, might be expected to be readily available.   We could not but regard it  as significant that after the withdrawal of the- inaccurate figures given in the first instance (which indioated a loss of 1,000 workers In a single year) no attempt was made to produce direct evidence of reduced employment in the Industry.4. Both in the Rules to be applied by the Board of Trade in considering an application and in the Instructions to Committees stress is laid on the effeot which the Imposition of a duty would have upon employment both in the applicant industry and in any other industry using goods of that class or description in production.     If we are unable to satisfy ourselves as to the existence or extent of unemployment in the past we are still less able to form any definite opinion as to the additional employment which would follow the Imposition of a duty.     We are asked to assume that if a duty of  1 per ton were imposed and all importation ceased, and if, further, the price was raised by 10/- per ton the demand for superphosphate would not be diminished.       Stich a suggestion,  as the Chairman has pointed out, does not come within the scope of the Safeguarding of Industries proposals as defined in the White Paper.     But we are unable to accept, the assumption that .a rise in price would not reduce the demand.5. In considering the net result of the imposition of a duty on employment we were invited to assume that a rise in the price of superphosphate to the extent of 10/- per ton could have no effect on employment in Agriculture.
It was argued that the additional cost per acre of a dressing of superphosphate would not exceed 3/Cd. The two farmers who gave evidence in opposition to the application were pressed to say whether so small an additional cost would cause a reduction of employment. Both ware unwilling to commit themselves to a definite assertion that an Increased cost of production strictly limited to this amount would in itself involve the discharge of farm workers.    *e do not consider that the effect of a duty on superphosphate can be measured so precisely.  In the first place it Is well known that superphosphate is an ingredient In many mixed or compound fertilisers which are widely used and it is evident that the price of all these  vould be affected if the cost of one Ingredient were incressed.    Further, it would be contrary to all experience if a rise in the price of one fertiliser did not react on the price of others. We cannot ignore the fact that in the present condition of Agriculture any permanent addition, ho waver small, to the post of production is likely to have an effect far greater than can be limited by logic.    Superphosphate is mainly used on arable land   and Is largely applied to corn croos.   There is a continuous movement at the present, time, under economic pressure, to reduce the area under arable cultivation.    During the last four ye^rs nearly 1J million acres of land have been laid down to grass in Great Britain,  which implies the discharge of about 35,000 workers.   It is evident that there are many oscupiers of land who are now hesitating whether to reduce their arable area and that with them a comparatively
trifltog addition to permanent costs may be sufficient to turn the scale.     Assuming that the effect of a rise in the price of fertilisers led to the conversion of only 10,000 acres of arable land to grass the reduotion of employment in Agriculture would more than counterbalance any possible increase of employment in the superphosphate industry caused by the-total exclusion of imports.6. As we understand the &quot;Instructions to Committees&quot; in the White Paper we have, after satisfying ourselves that the industry is of &quot;substantial importance&quot;, to consider three main points, namely:-(a) Whether imports are &quot;abnormal&quot;;(b) Whether they are being offered below cost ofprofitable production in this country;    and(c) Whether foreign competition has affected or will affect&apos; employment. ./On points (a) and (c) our opinion shortly is:-(a) The imports in 1923 and 1924 were abnormal in quantity, i.e. they were substantially in excess of those recorded for previous years;(a) That the evidence as to present or future effect of imports on employment is inconclusive but the effect is probably small.Affirmative answers, however, qualified, on these three points are presumably sufficient to justify the competition.being regarded as &quot;exceptional&quot; within the terms of the White!Paper.7. With regard to point (b) the Chairman accepts the sum&quot; of  3.8.8. per ton as representing- the present cost of production of superphosphate in this country.    On this basis it follows that the cost at which it can be profitably manufactured or produced is about  3.12.0 allowing 5 per oent. profit. The average price at which British makers are now selling superphosphate is  3 per ton ranging from  2.16.3 to  3.5.0 per ton in different districts.    It was suggested to us that
for a considerable period, not specially defined, losses of the order of magnitude represented by these figures nave been generally made by firms engaged in the Industry.    If this were so even a duty of 7/6 per ton as proposed by the Chairman would not suffice to save the Industry from the ultimate extinction with which the Applicants assured us it is threatened.8. A number of balance sheets and of trading accounts were sumbitted to us and we have no hesitation in accepting the evidence that some of the firms engaged in the Industry have during the last two or three years made heavy losses on trading, although certain of them appear to have made a profit.   We cannot, however, regard such losses as in them-selves establishing a claim for a duty under the proposals for the safeguarding of industries.   There are probably few industries which could not show similar losses during the same period.   We cannot ignore the fact that no evidence was submitted to show that any firm engaged in the manufacture of superphosphate had gone out of business.    Indeed the Committee were- informed by the Applicants that the membership of their association (85 firms, comprising all but one^of the known makers of superphosphate) had remained constant for several years past.   Had the loss on the manufacture and sale of the article been as heavy as was represented it is difficult to believe that some of the financially weaker firms would not have succumbed to the pressure.9, The difficulty of arriving at a fair judgment of the&apos;&apos; financial position of the Industry arises largely from the fact that practically all the manufacturers of super-phosphate whose accounts were referred to are also makers of, ;and dealers in, several, and in some eases many,&apos; other
commodities.   The allocatlon-of^ooffts^ or of losses to one particular product is a matter of accountancy.Notwithstanding the very valuable guidance given us bythe Chairman we are still left in doubt, in many cases,as to how far the figures presented to us were exact, and howfar they were estimates.   It was, at any rate, clear to us that they had not all been prepared on the same basis, although the accounts of *ach firm were certified by the, professional accountant engaged by them and familiar with the ir books *10.   A similar difficulty arises in attempting to form a reasonable opinion as to the price at which superphosphate &quot;can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom&quot;.   We oannot accept as conclusive the mere arithmetical average of the oost per ton shown by a number of firms whioh exhibit wide divergence among themselves. The figures submitted to us by 21 firms ranged from  3.1,3 to  4,8.7 per ton.     Oost of materials ranged from  1,13.2 to  2,15.11 cost of bags from 3/5 to 7/7, while total net operating costs ranged from  2.10.01- to  3,13,9*     These would appear to represent definite figures in each case though it was suggested that In some cases certain readjustments of actual costs had been made.   The amounts charged for depreciation and on-cost showed even greater variation.    An explanation offered of the great diversity of the figures was that the output of the different firms bore different relationships to the capacity of their works.     After giving due weight to this consideration we are still unconvinced that the necessary cost of production is represented by the mean of so wide a range of figures.   We do not profess to be able, from the material before us to fix a figure which
would represent the minimum,cost-of production in this country but,  in any case, we do not regard this as of great importance as we are satisfied that not only at the present time but for many years, extending back to the pre-war period,  offers of foreign superphosphate have been made at prices which are deliberately intended to undersell the home manufacturera11. Under heading (5) of the Instructions we have now to satisfy ourselves that the competition is unfair by reason of one or more of three causes.   We agree with the Chairman that the only one of these causes to be considered in connection with the present Application is that of &quot;Depreciation of currency operating so as to create a bounty&quot;.12.   We agree generally with the statement in paragraphs 50-54 of the chairman Report in regard to the definition of a bounty on exports and the summary of the arguments as presented to us.   We wish to add our appreciation of the assistance given to the committee in considering this subject by Sir H. Cassie Holden, Bt., Counsel for the Applicants and Mr. J.B. Guild, Joint Secretary of the National Farmers&apos; Union, in opposition.13.   In 1924 nearly 68 per cent of the total imports of-super-.... phosphate came from Belgium and Prance where the currency is, and for the last six or seven years has been, much depreciated.     It is generally recognised that during a period when the value of a currency is depreciating a bounty or premium on exports arises by reason of the fact that the costs of production are wholly or partially incurred at a different aitage in the course of monetary depreciation from that at which the goods are marketed.
6 3 iIn the case of Belgium, on which the Applicants mainly relied, a relatively stable position on a depreciated basis had been established before 1925 when the imports of superphosphate to this country first became &quot;abnormal&quot;.    It is true that since the enquiry was concluded there has been a further fall in the value of the franc both in Belgium and Prance but we do not consider we are justified in talcing into account speculations as to the future course of the exchanges as a sufficient reason for reconrnend-ing the imposition of a duty for two years, or for any period. We think that in the past two or three years, i.e., during the time to which the evidence submitted to the Committee chiefly related, some bounty on Belgian exports generally has arisen   by reason of the depreciation of the currency.    The evidence and arguments on this point were directed to tne question of the amount of this general bounty.    Whatever the amount may be we cannot assume that it applies equally to all Belgian industries, the internal costs of which may have varied in such a way as to neutralise, in the case of a particular industry, the advantage of such a bounty. 14.   The Chairman considers that it is &quot;over straining the case to attempt to draw a distinction bet?;een the superphosphate industry as carried on in Belgium and Prance and the whole industrial conditions obtaining In those countries&quot;.   We are not concerned with arguments that.might possibly be adduced in support of the imposition of duties on all imports from Belgium and Prance.    The Committee have to consider whether a   case has been made out for selecting superphosphate as the subject of a duty to be applied to imports of that commodity from, all sources. Por this purpose we are not justified in merely accepting-the presumption that&quot;a general bounty applies to the particular commodity with which we are concerned.   Under paragraph 8 of the Instructions to Committees we are to decide &quot;whether the applicant industry ....... has established a claim to duty&quot;.    The onus,therefore, lies on the Applicants not only to satisfy the Committee that the depreciation of the currency operates so as to create
bounty on exports but also that foreign- oompe-tition inthe superphosphate. industry is unfair in consequence.It is not sufficient to raise a presumption of unfair competition arising from that cause; the Committee must at least be satisfied that the facts of the case cannotbe otherwise reasonably explained.15. The Applicants base their claim mainly on the&quot;abnormality&quot; of the imports from Belgium.   The table givenin par. 29 of the Chairman&apos;s report shows that during thefour years prior to 1914 imports from that country increased from 19,600 to 59,000 tons.   When trade was resumed after thewar imports in 1921 came In practically the same volumeas in 1913.    In 1922 there was a slight reduction followed in 1923 by a marked increase which was followed by a subs tan -tial reduction in 1924,Taking the two periods 1910-13 and 1921.-24 the increaseof imports was 100 per cent, in the pre-war period, and63 per cent, with a tendency to decline, in the post-war period.    In the first four months of 1925 the total importsshowed a further reduction as compared with the correspondingperiod of 1924 as follows:-1924, 1925,       DecreaseTons. Tons.       per cent.January-April.......   65,679 62,326 5.1These facts do not support the presumption that any exceptional cause was operating to account for increaseimports in the latter period which was not operating In.theformer.16. The presumption that competition from Belgium arises from depreciation of currency is definitely weakened by the marked Increase in competition from the Netherlands, where there is no depreciation of the currency.    The Chairman in his Report refers to the fact that while imports from
Belgium have increased.since 1921 by 63 per cent, those from the Netherlands have increased by over 700 per cent.17.    In view of these facts we are not satisfied that the competition of which the Applicants complain arises from depreciation of currency operating so as to create an export bounty on superphosphate.      It appears  to us from the evidence laid before the Committee that in Belgium, Prance and the Netherlands manufacturers of superphosphate have been alert in adapting their works and equipment to post-war conditions and by legitimate enterprise have lowered their costs of production and successfully developed an export trade. British manufacturers generally have been less alert, with the result that their foreign competitors have been able to enter both the home and overseas markets and,  in some degree, capture the trade.     Many of the British makers have, somewhat tardily, awakened to the necessity of taking active measures to meet the new conditions.     Already there appear to us to be signs that the severity of foreign competition is lessening and we attribute this mainly to the fact that it has acted as a spur to the enterprise of the British makers.     The manufacture of superphosphate originated in this country and we see no reason to doubt that British manufacturers will in the future, as in the past, be able to dominate the home market and at the same time recapture a large part of the export trade which has slipped from them.     We cannot but think, that, under present conditions, the imposition of a duty would be more likely to act as a narcotic than a tonic on the superphosphate industry.     However, this may be we have no hesitation in stating that, in our judgment, the existence of unfair competition caused by depreciation of the currency has not been proved.18. Having regard to all the conditions we are of the opinion that the Applicants have failed to establish a claim to a duty.
19,   We cordially concur with the Chairman in expressing appreciation of the valuable services rendered to the Committee by the Secretary, Mr, W.H.L. Patterson, whose ability and assiduity have been of great assistance to us throughout the Enquiry.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servants,ARTHUR HOLLINS. HENRY REW,
WHXNNEY,  SMITH &amp; WHINNEY,4b, Frederick1s Place,Old Jewry, London, E.C.2.My dear President,Superphosphates.You will have received a Report from myself as Chairman of the Committee, in which you will observe that I have recommended the imposition of an import duty of 7s.6d. per ton. Unfortunately, my Colleagues, Sir Henry Rew and Mr. Hollins do not share my views.     They do not consider that the Applicants have satisfied the requirements of the White Paper,     I am sorry that I have found it impossible to remove their objections and so promote unanimity.     I venture to think that they have failed to give due weight to the main evidence.The Enquiry has, however, brought out clearly the parlous state of the Superphosphate Industry, and its inability to combat Foreign Competition unless assistance is afforded to it.Without in any way detracting from the conclusions I have reached, I venture to submit for your consideration a further suggestion which does not come within the scope of the enquiry upon which the Committee have been engaged.     The plan is a development of the idea I think you had in mind when you laid before me recently a certain Secret Memorandum.If the recommended duty of 7s. 6d., per ton is sufficient to result in Foreign Superphosphate being largely kept out of the United Kihgdon, Increased employment in the Home Industry should follow.My suggestion Is that if the Import Duty is imposed as I recommend and is coupled with a subsidy to the Industry of such a sum as would otherwise be paid In unemployment benefit, not
only should the Industry be able to satisfy the demands of the Home Market, but British Manufacturers would be placed in a position to re-establish their hold over and to develop the Export Trade.     The sum to be allocated could be limited to a definite amount say  100,000,If new Plant has to be installed,  the Manufacturers would probably obtain assistance under the provisions of the Trade Facilities Act; - thus incidentally giving further employment in the Engineering Industry.Thus assisted,  the British Manufacturer ought to be enabled to reduce the price to the Home Consumer and even bring it below that at which Foreign Manufactured Superphosphate is at present being sold in this Country,It is not possible to be certain how the figures would work out, but I suggest for your consideration the followingThere is at present imported into this Country about 140,000 tons of Superphosphate per annum:    let it be assumed that the Duty of 7s.6d0, per ton will prevent the bulk of this importation, it would then follow that to the extent of the goods kept out, the quantity would be manufactured by British Producers,The British Export Trade in 1913 amounted to about 60,000 tons.     Let it be assumed, that by reason of the dole subsidy,  this trade will be recaptured by the British Manufacturer. The manufacture of an additional 200,000 tons of Superphosphate in the United Kingdom would have the effect of providing employment for about 1,300 additional men.If the dole in respeot of such men amounts to  1. 5, Od., per man per week,  on the average, it follows that the subsidy would amount to about  80,000 per annum.    The country would be no loser whilst the British Manufacturer would recover the Export Trade,Although it may be argued that the increase In employment
would not be large if the plan were put into operation,  there is always the alternative to be thought of that unless this Industry receives some artificial stimulus, many manufacturers will have to go out of business.     The Applicants contended this strongly before the Committee, and if such came to pass, increased unemployment would be the result.It is fair to state that the information before me is not such that I can be certain that the matter would work out as I predict, but I think there is established a prima facie case for Enquiry,   Accordingly I venture to suggest that the Board of Trade might summon a Conference with the Fertiliser Manufacturers Association with the object of obtaining their views as practical men of business, whether the Industry would be able to achieve the end I have in view.The Association represents the whole trade and the enquiry would not take long,  for most of the Information must already be in the possession of the Association, or if not, oould be obtained quite quickly.Even if the experiment proved ultimately not to be a success, no large sum of money would ba involved and the suggestion that the Government are doing everything possible to assist Industry would receive additional impetus.Yours very truly, (Signed)    ARTHUR WHINNEY.The Rt. Hon. Sir Philip Cunliffe Lister, K.B.E., M.C., M.P., President, Board of Trade,Great George Street,WESTMINSTER,      S.W.I.
