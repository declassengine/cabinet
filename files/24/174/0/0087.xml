(THIS jjQCUMJSNT JES TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET,C A. BIN S T.3CP. 583(25)..THE    RUBBER    POSITION.Memorandum by the Secretary&apos;of State for the Colonies..My colleagues had before them at the end of July a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to representations by the United States Ambassador, on the operation of the Rubber Export Restriction Regulationsmy Advisory Committee (on which the India Rubber Manufacturers-Association and the British Rubber Tyre Manufacturers&apos; Association, amongst others, are represented) the present position and prospects in the- industry.     I satisfied myself that there are objections to making alterations,, particularly sudden unexpected alterations, in what is a virtually automatic scheme of releases of extra rubber based on the average quarterly price of the commodity in London.The main objections are on two grounds, viz.; (1) Government Interference, which would upset the market calculations of the genuine merchant, and obviously react in a way which he would have grounds for regarding as Unfair to himself, seeing that he had. been working on the assumption that the scheme based as it was on Government legislation was a reliable one.pin Ceylon and Malaya.I.P.564 25).A few hours later I was able to discuss personally with
(2)     The labour supply for the plant at ions/r. Ceylon and Malaya which for the oast four-years has been subnormal owing to the depression in the producing industry.      It is agreed amongst the growers that little more than 75/* of their &quot;standard production&quot; could be produced without two or preferably three months&apos; notice, i.e, sufficient notice to enable them to import further labour from India, or elsew&apos; ere,     Sudden authority for an immediate unanticipated scale of release would at once lead not to any substantial increase of total production, but only to poaching of labour by the less scrupulous employers, and would be regarded, I think reasonably, as unfair to the.better type of employers, who stand to lose most in any scramble for the available supply of labour.My view, therefore, is that to authorise the Ceylon and Lalayan Governments to notify any immediate abnormal&apos;release of rubber on minimum duty would be unfair to two important sections of the industry, and would not, in fact, result in the immediate increase of supplies to consumers oI have had supplied to me an estimate of production and absorption in 1925 based on data supolied by tie Rubber Association of America,. According to that Associations statement, the stocks on hand in the United States and afloat for United States Ports amounted at the beginning of this year to 99,000 tons.      In addition to this, I understand t. at the London and Liverpool Stocks at the sane date were estimated at 32,500 tons, besides stocks elsewhere ir &quot; europe and the East.
It is estimated that the free stocks in the world had decreased by the 1st of July to the extent of 62,000 tons,  but that after that date the shrinkage of stooks ceased,  and over the last six months of this year stocks will expand to the extent of 19,00C tons.    These estimates include previsions for the recent release on legal advice by the Malay States Government of 6,000 tons of &quot;uncouponed&quot; rubber, in itself equivalent to an additional release of 7- $ of the standard production of Malaya, but dc not take into account any quarterly in c: eases of the exportable percentage beyond 10$ on the 1st of August, which has now been authorised, and 10$ on the 1st of November next.I have not yet found any reliable estimate of the rates of supply and absorption  for 1926, but such figures as I have seen Indicate that a further addition to the free stocks may be expected over next year.The estimated increase in the world1 s free stocks after the 1st July of this year seems to show that any crisis there may have been has now passed, and this is borne out by the appreciable fall in prices both for &quot;spot&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; rubber in the last two or three weeks.The statistical position is further improved by my recent decision  to approve the proposals of the EiKh Commissioner for the Llalay States to increase the assessments of estates in Malaya;    this re-assessment will mean that 75$ of standard production under the revised assessment will be equivalent in fact to rather over 80$ under the old assessment.
This is not the first time that the assessment scales have been revised by the local Governments concerned, and it will not, 1 am assured, be regarded as liable to either of the main objections stated above, neither does it require any local legislation to implement  it, or conflict with the provisions of the scheme as published in the White. Paper of October 1922, as well as locally by the Ceylon and Malayan Governments,I do not propose to reject entirely the possibility of having to authorise as from November 1st a revision of the existing scheme so as to permit of a higher rate of export on minimum duty if the price remains abnormal, but in view of the considerations stated above, I have thought  it best to request my Advisory Committee to consider this special point afresh at the end of August in the light of the situation which may then have developed.      If at that time the price of rubber in London is still excessive and shows no decided tendency towards a reasonable figure,  I propose to take the step of giving public notice that the scale of increases of the exportable percentage will be revised in the sense mentioned above if the average price of rubber over the current or any subsequent quarter exceeds a certain figure to be decided upon.L.  S. A.Colonial Office,August  5th, 1925.
