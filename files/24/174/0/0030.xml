- 1MP1DENT1AL UBRARI,Copy No-.I have no observations to make on most of the memorandum &quot;on the Widows1 and Orphans1 and Old Age Contributory Pensions Bill circulated by the Secretary of State for War. But the memorandum does not state correctly the position of the Ministry of Health as to future Service pensions for widows and orphans where death is attributable to service.Shortly that position is as follows.     If the full contributions under the Bill are paid in respect of Service men, it may appear to follow logically that full benefits -under the Bill should be given,     But it is the fact that the contributions provided by the Bill were not estimated with reference to such contingencies as being run over by a field gun at manoeuvres or dying from malaria on the West-Coast of Africa.     The extreme claim on the part of the Service Departments which could be admitted is that their risks are no greater than the risks attendant on certain branches of industry, e.g. coalmining.     There is, however, special provision made by the Wcrkmen*s Compensation Acts for compensation for these Industrial risks and what the Bill, as proposed to be amended, does is to provide that in these oases the widow^ pension is payable under the Bill in addition to compensation and the children obtain not lass than the ohildren&apos;s allowances under the Bill.     The Ministry of Health would have -no objection to treating the Service cases precisely in the same way.     But serious difficulty arises in regard to Ministry of Pensions cases where men are now drawing disability pension but are in insurable employment and win pay full contributions.     The Ministry of Health are advised that in 40 per cent of the cases, as the men die,the widow will receive the-full war pension of 26/8 a week.*** 1 ****IS DgCTMMT IS THE PROPERTY 0?

If, in addition, full pension is paid under the Bill, the total receipts of the widow will be 36/8 a week, and it appears tothe Ministry of Health that the discrepancy between the case ofthese war widows and that of other service widows who will onlybe receiving 10/- a week is likely to give rise to serious trouble.     Moreover, if the full bill pension is awarded atonce in these cases, the pensions account will have to face aserious additional liability whioh cannot be estimated.   the compromise proposal in paragraph 4 of the memorandum of theSecretary of State for War was devised as being probably theleast objectionable way of mitigating these difficulties. Theeffect of it is to post-date acceptance of the claim of theService Departments to full service * full Bill pension to atime when the Ministry of Pensions difficulty may be expectedto have become much less serious, if not altogether to have dissapeared.   The compromise proposal would also includepayment to children not less than the allowances provided, under-the Bill.(Intd)   N.C.try of Health, July 7th, 1925o
