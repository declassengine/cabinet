Briand.Dear Monsieur Briand, Foreign Gffi,ce, July 2, 1925.SINCE I parted from you at Geneva I have been very carefully considering the suggestion made by you and supported by M. Boncour, that we should prepare some agreed programme in relation to security for the Assembly of the League of Nations to be held in September next. You told me that, after comparing carefully my declaration on the Protocol at the March meeting of the Council with the clauses of the Covenant and the Protocol itself, you thought that we could extract from the Protocol provisions to which His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken no objection, and that we might make these the basis of a new proposal to the Assembly. M. Boncour at the same time suggested that we could usefully take up at any rate the question of the unanimity required for decisions of the Council (except in certain specified matters) and of the definition of an &quot; aggressor.&quot; 1 indicated to you. my doubts upon this subject at the time. The more I have reflected on it, the less expedient does it seem to me that we should enter, at the present stage at any rate, on any further attempt to amend the Covenant. We are in fact engaged at this moment in a great effort to support it by the system of mutual pacts and arbitration treaties contemplated in our negotiations with Germany. If we are, as I think there is every prospect we shall be, successful in these negotiations, we shall have made a very great contribution to the peace of the world and to the strength of the League of Nations.If we can terminate these negotiations in time to present their results to the Assembly, that fact will make the September gathering the most remarkable since the first occasion on which the Assembly met, and will itself have done more than any revision of the Covenant to render peace secure. If, on the other hand, the negotiations are not termiuated, I cannot think that it would be wise that we should start at Geneva a discussion which must necessarily overlap the negotiations in course of progress between Germany and her various neighbours, and might greatly embarrass us at some critical moment of our conversations. Indeed, if we had any difficulties with the German Government, we might in such circumstances find that the discussion was practically removed from the conference room where our treaty was being negotiated to the Assembly Hall of the League.These seem to me sound practical reasons for not reopening at the September Assembly the questions which occupied the main attention of its meeting last year. But there is another reason which I would like to submit to you. A considerable section of this country views our negotiations and the proposed British guarantee of the Rhineland and the arbitration treaties with some suspicion lest Great Britain should be involved in obligations which might later become embarrassing and even dangerous. I do not believe that this opinion is that of the majority of our countrymen or even of a large minority, but undoubtedly there is a certain uneasiness upon the subject, and I should be very loth to imperil those negotiations by under-taking at the same time a discussion oE larger issues about which we might find it difficult to agree aud which would certainly increase any apprehensions that are felt here about our narrower pact. For all these reasons 1 feel, and my colleagues in the Government agree with me, that it is not in the interest of a successful treaty of guarantee that we should be called upon to discuss these wider issues at this time.It is scarcely necessary for me to say that in submitting these views for your consideration, I have no idea of suggesting any curtailment of the liberty of the Assembly, nor need I add that His Majesty&apos;s Government would warmly welcome at this Assembly, or on any other occasion, any practical advance towards the limitation of armaments. But this is a very different thing from suggesting to the Assembly yet another attempt to rewrite or amend the Covenant.This letter arises so directly out of our conversation at your luncheon party that I have thought it better to put our views before you in this informal way rather than to deal with the matter in a despatch to Lord Crewe or in any formal communication to M. de Fleuriau.Believe me, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.[1006 b-1]
