CABINET.TELEPHONE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.Note by the Chancellor of the     chequer.With reference to CP. 304(25),  I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum relating to-&apos; :\ .-. \&apos;. Telephone Capital Expenditure.. .v,Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. 6th July,  1925oThe Chancellor of the Exchequer does not desire to minimise the Post Office difficulties,, but he thinks they ought also to consider those of the Treasury.    Telephone construction is only one of the many items of capital expenditure which the State has to finance.     Unless the State goes into the Market, which on grounds of general finance it only ought to do in the last resort,  tepephone construction can only be financed to the extent to which tho capital can be provided from the accumulations of the Post Office Savings Bank.     How the Post Office Savings Bank has&apos; to provide not only for the telegraphic construction, but for Irish Land&apos; Pur ah aso,  for certain Trade Facility loans and above all for the Local Loans Eund, whose demands in view of the housing programme are very largo and increasing.      Moreover there may be other items, for instance, Electricity for. which some provision has to&apos;be made.      It is essential, therefore, to correlate the Post Office demasds to those for other purposes.      They cannot be treated as a separate entity,  bearing ho relation to the general scheme, of Government finance.    This is absolutely fundamental,confidential  UB&quot;
neIn view of these circumstances, it is not enough to say that the Telephone Service is producing a small (though decreasing) annual surplus;   It often happens that a business can make a profit out of a particular extension but is not able to make that extension because it cannot get the capital.     That may be the position of the Post Office.   Even If the Podt Office makes a profit on telephones it is necessary to look further and consider whether such profit may not add additional dobt to the taxpayer.     If for instance the telephone service can only bo increased by forcing the Treasury to make Government issues in the Market, and if such issues, as would be tho case, would greatly intensify the Chancellor of the Exchequers difficulties in making substantial savings by converted*n ,;ing the existing public debt on favourable terms, then the taxpayer might very well have purchased a small profit on the- telephones by a very much heavier loss on other services.     At the present time, when every saving In public expenditure must be mado, and when ttoo available considerable savings are not many, it is of vital importance for the finance of the Country and for the taxpayer, that the chance of favour-able Conversion Loans, which are most important in the next year or so, should not be spoilt by the Government being forced into issues in other directions.The Postmaster General argues that the fact that the Govommezst are encouraging capital expenditure through Trade Facilities Acts makes it anomalous for the Treasury to resist capital expenditure on telephones.     But in the first place the fact that the Government have other commitments, e*.g. Trade Facilities loans, makes it more difficult, not more easy, to finance telephones; and in the second place, so far from providing no monoy for telephone capital, the Treasury are now providing, and have expressed their willingness to provide far greater sums per annum than have ever been spent before.
There are, however, very distinct limits to the amount of &quot; money which can bo made available for all these State purposes, and If too ranch is allocated to telephones, the Treasury will not be In a position to finance other, and possibly more Important capital needs.It is far from the case that the Telephone Service has been starved.   Expenditure on telephone capital had in pre-war years, apart from the purchase of the telephone system, never exceeded  3,000,000 in any year, and was generally very much less*   In tho years sinoe the war it has been as follows:-1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 5,860,000  7;696,000  7 309; 000  7,800,000  9,582,000On several occasions in the last few years the Treasury have warned tho Post Office that there would be difficulty about continuing to provide capital on the present scale, so the Post Office have been well aware of the difficulties ahead.For 192p the Treasury had agreed to  10,000,000 a larger sura than has ever been spent before.     In further discussions the Treasury invited the Post Office to formulate their needs over a period of years, as it is very necessary that a definite arrangement should now be made covering, not one year only but also the future.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer is willing to make the following offer, viz. that tho State should find for telephone construction in the next three years a maximum sum of  32,000,000, to be divided roughly oqually between the three years.     There would be no objection to the Post Office taking rather more this year and rather less in the future, if that suits thoir arrangements better;    but the Chancellor cf the Exchequer, having regar-.. to other commitments coul&apos; not agree to go beyond this very large
total and can only go to this sum on the distinct under-standing that the Post Office will regard it as a maximum for the 3 years, 1925, 1926 and 1927.     Even so the difficulties of providing for the general capital needs of the State, consistently with any hope of Conversion operations, v;ill be considerable.4,
