July 1925.6 4    (25n*v!rshall n^v^-V&apos;---eeNFTDENTIAL.W 7067/5208/50]MEMORANDUM.THE American Ambassador handed me to-day in the form of an aide-memoire representations which he was instructed to make in regard to the working of the Rubber Restriction Regulations.Mr. Houghton said that, in formally presenting this case, he would like to make to me some observations of a different character and on an entirely different footing and to invite my friendly co-operation towards finding a solution of a problem which seemed to him bigger than any mere trading question. He spoke with appreciation o t&apos; the help which he supposed me to have rendered in securing that the new duties of the Finance Act should not be made retrospective, and he appealed to me for help in treating the present difficulty on equally broad lines.He showed me a telegram from a personal friend of his, sent with the knowledge of Mr. Kellogg, urging the critical position in which American users of rubber were placed and, as the Ambassador said, imploring him in almost &quot; panicky &quot; terms to do what he could to secure some relaxation of the restriction; and Mr. Houghton added that the writer was generally a very temperate and level-headed man.With these preliminaries, he said that, if he were presenting the case to me, he should do so on the basis that the American buyers and users had been very foolish, that they had not believed in the success of the Stevenson Act, that they had not taken good and friendly advice to buy gradually and in time, and that they were now caught by their own folly. But even so, he urged that it was not in the interest of British industry in the broadest sense to insist on extorting the full momentary advantage which this state of things procured for the British Empire or for certain speculators. In the first place, the Americans had been turning their attention to the development of the use of rubber for new purposes, such, for instance, as flooring, or its extended use in footwear. This movement had already made some progress, but it was now abruptly checked and might be destroyed when the price of rubber stood at 5s. a pound or over. Secondly, if this rubber famine persisted, America would be driven to go out to secure her own rubber supplies whether in Africa or in the Dutch possessions, in regard to which some negotiations were already going on, or elsewhere. Thirdly (though this he mentioned with great hesitation and whilst repeating that he felt that he must not for ever be coming to me with this argument about public opinion), there were immense and politically most influential interests involved both by the immediate danger of a great discharge of workpeople and also by the necessity for still further increases of price to the individual consumer of the manufactured articles. Speaking with great moderation but with great seriousness and in harmony with all that he has said to me on wider aspects of policy, he begged me to think how deplorable it would be if, at a time when the President of the United States sympathised with our European policy and desired to do what he could to forward it, and when the state of the world made it more than ever necessary that we should co-operate, a conflict over a trading question made such assistance and co-operation impossible.The Ambassador said that, with the exception of Mr. Firestone and perhaps one or two others, the American interests concerned accepted the policy of stabilisation and would not quarrel about any reasonable increase of price. Here they were caught in a trap devised, if I liked, by their own folly, but still involving quite disastrous consequences which were not intended by the Stevenson Plan, the object of which had been not to obtain extravagant prices or to play into the hands of speculators, but to stabilise prices at a fair and a remunerative level.Finally, the Ambasador begging me not to take, as I was about to do, a note of what he was going to say, and disclaiming any desire to utter any sort of threat, said that he must add that there had been some talk of reprisals in the United States. The United States Government had never placed any restrictions upon export or any duties on exported goods, and to him it was unthinkable that they 2992a&apos;  [13385]
should do so, but there was some talk about cotton and copper. He thought that it would be quite disastrous if we entered upon a competition of this kind.I have no doubt in my own mind of Mr. Houghton&apos;s genuinely friendly disposition. I am sure that he speaks the truth and no more than the truth when he says that he wants our two countries to co-operate increasingly in international affairs, though he would look to Germany as a third partner in such co-operation rather than to France. He talked with gravity and persuasively I might even say pleadingly. He felt an obvious dislike to being obliged to raise yet another question of this character, but I am sure that the fear which he expressed of the effect which a rigid adherence to the restrictions under present conditions would have was genuine, and I must admit that I was.impressed by what he said. I told him that the very form in which he had put his argument and the admissions which he had made dispensed me from offering the reply which I might otherwise have given, and that I must consult my colleagues in the light of what he had said.My own inclination is very strongly in favour of finding some compromise which may maintain the spirit and the purpose of the Stevenson Plan, secure the stabilisation of prices within reasonable limits, and avoid the dangers which must arise to our international relations from the growing agitation in America, which attributes to British Government action all the evil results which are accruing from the short-sightedness or folly of the American users of rubber.A.

Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1925.CONFIDENTIAL.[W 7067/5208/50]Mr. Austen Chamberlain to Mr. Chilton (Washington).(No. 1187.)Sir, Foreign Office, July 22, 1925.THE United States Ambassador left with me to-day the enclosed aide-memoire on the rubber position. His Excellency accompanied its presentation with an exposition of the position and an argument in relation to it to which I promised the most careful consideration, but I told him that, until I had consulted with my colleagues, I could make no reply.I am, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.Enclosure. Aide-memoire.A CRITICAL situation seems to have arisen as a result of the restriction of rubber exports from Ceylon, the Federated Malay States and the Straits Settlements under the Stevenson plan. The rubber industry in the United States involves roughly 1 billion dollars; it consumes more than 70 per cent, of the world&apos;s production of rubber, and directly or indirectly gives employment to more than 1 million persons. The disrupting effect to the industry of the recent advance in prices in the short space of eleven weeks, namely, from about Is. Qd. per lb. to about 4s. Qd., has caused great concern in the United States. It appears that this great advance in prices is due partly to speculation and partly because practically no stocks exist either in London or in the United States; and that unless some relief is afforded a partial closing down of American rubber manufactories is inevitable.It is perhaps useless at this time to go into the question of how the situation might have been avoided, as it would merely open up a discussion which can in no way alter the fact that this vast American industry is in jeopardy. To relieve the situation it has been suggested that instead of the 10 per cent, release of the exports of rubber from the States mentioned, which is contemplated under the Stevenson plan on the 1st August, an additional 10 per cent, release should be made.A delegation of the Rubber Association of America has recently conferred with Mr. Broderick, Commercial Counsellor of the British Embassy at Washington, and made the following suggestions which, it is understood, have been forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Government by Mr. Broderick : &quot; 1. That the British Government make an announcement of policy along the following lines : &apos; The object of the Government in promoting the Stevenson Act was to stabilise the price of crude rubber at a price that would best serve the common interests of the grower and the consumer; this is still its purpose, and it is determined to take such measures as are necessary to check any undue speculative activity that would defeat that purpose.&apos;&quot;2. That the exportable allowance of crude rubber be increased by 20 per cent, (instead of 10 per cent.) on the 1st August, 1925.:&apos; 3. That from now on and until the amount of rubber in London reaches 50,000 tons, rubber in excess of the exportable allowance be permitted to be-shipped to bonded warehouses  in London for subsequent release within exportable allowances.&quot;4. To prevent the recurrence of violent speculative movements and encourage additional planting of rubber for insuring future supplies, that the present plan be rendered more elastic by providing for an additional 5 per cent, increase in exportable allowance of every 3d. increase over Is. Qd., and for suitable decreases in exportable allowances upon decreases in price below Is.&quot;2992   [13384][This Document is the Property ef His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] *
It is essential that the price of rubber should be stabilised at a reasonable figure if the American manufacturer is to continue operations in a normal way and develop to its utmost the use of rubber, which, in turn, would encourage and make profitable its growth in a manner which would serve the common interests of both grower and consumer and restore the equilibrium from which the industry has been thrown. It is believed that the suggestions above mentioned might serve as steps towards restoring this equilibrium.London, July 22, 1925.
