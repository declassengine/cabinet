I.-INTRODUCTION.We, the Imperial Economic Committee, representing His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Governments of the Self-Governing Dominions, India, the Colonies and Protectorates, acting under our terms of reference published on the 6th of March 1925, beg leave to present to the Governments of the Empire this our First Report.Reference.1. Under our Terms of Reference, we have been asked to consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketing within the United Kingdom the food products of the Overseas parts of the Empire with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom in preference to imports from foreign countries, and to promote the interests both of producers and of consumers. It has further been agreed that attention should in the first place be concentrated on meat and fruit, other food-stuffs being reserved for subsequent investigation.The Position of the Home Producer.2. These Terms of Reference should, we think, be read in conjunction with the following words used by Mr. Baldwin in his speech in the House of Commons on the 17th of December 1924 when he announced that an Imperial Economic Committee would be set up. &quot; The Dominions have always recognized that our home producers have, and always should have, the first place in the home market, but they ask, and we think rightly ask, that they should have a preference over foreign countries as regards that part of the home market which cannot be supplied by the home producer.&quot; We desire to express our unanimous and emphatic agreement with this view. The whole Committee wish to see precedence given in the British market for food-stuffs in the following order : Home Produce       ..       ..       ..       ..   FirstDominion and Colonial Produce  ..       ..   SecondForeign Produce     ..       ..       ..       ..   ThirdWe have consistently set this prerogative of the home producer before us in our inquiries. But, however much the production of the home country may be increased, there must still remain a great deficiency before its needs are satisfied, and our desire is that this deficiency should be made good, as far as practicable, from within the Empire instead of from foreign countries.The following percentages, compiled from figures supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of the United Kingdom, indicate the margin in 1924 between the supplies available from
home production and the total consumption of the United Kingdom: Description.	Home Production.	Imports from			Empire Countries.

As supplementary to our main Terms of Reference, we have also had allotted to us the duty of suggesting schemes upon which a sum of  1,000,000 a year, set aside by the British Government, might usefully be spent. This sum, we understand, represents roughly the value to the Empire producer of the preferences on certain food products which were proposed at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, and to which effect has not been given. We are not, however, instructed to treat this matter merely as one of compensation. The wording of Mr. Baldwin&apos;s speech, already referred to, is clear on this point. In that speech he expresses the hope that with the annual grant in question &quot; it may be possible to open up entirely new and untried ways of developing trade with the Empire.&quot;Method of Inquiry.4., In order to expedite our proceedings we found it desirable at an early stage of our inquiry to appoint two Sub-Committees consisting respectively of those of our members who had special knowledge and experience on the one hand of the meat industry and on the other hand of the fruit industry, and .we shall present separate Reports based on their work. In the present Report we deal with those larger aspects of the subject which, although they have come before us more particularly in regard to meat and fruit, yet have a general bearing.Meat and Fruit Reports. 5. The Report on the marketing of meat will be presented simultaneously with this Report, but the enquiry into the market-ing of fruit has proved to be of a complicated character and the-
Report on that subject needs further consideration. We hope to present it before the end of the year. In the meantime a Note which has been prepared by our Sub-Committee on Fruit will be found at the conclusion of this Report.Meetings and Witnesses.6. We have thus far held 23 meetings of the whole Committee and in addition there have been 28 meetings of Sub-Committees. We have based our conclusions primarily on the views and infor-mation contributed by the delegates from the different parts of the Empire constituting our body, but we have also heard many witnesses, both from the Home country and the Overseas Dominions and territories. We have further had the advantage of consultation with experienced officials both of the Home and Overseas Governments and we desire to take this opportunity of thanking these gentlemen for their skilled assistance.Limits of Present Report.7. Our duty is to propose methods of turning the trend of commerce into channels which will most effectively assist in the development of the Empire. It is a task at once complex, difficult and delicate, and cannot be hurried. The work is by no means finished, but we have considered some of the problems submitted to us and have arrived at definite conclusions on certain questions of policy on which we desire to report at once. We divide this Report into three parts, dealing respectively with the identification-tion of Empire Produce, Research, and Finance.II.   THE IDENTIFICATION OF EMPIRE PRODUCE.Methods of Preference.8. Though many of us represent portions of the Empire in which substantial tariff preferences are given to British imports, and though new preferences have been established in the United Kingdom itself during the present year, we recognize that we are precluded from putting forward recommendations involving preference through the operation of tariffs. Subsidies, we think, should be adopted only in special cases. We have not yet con-sidered in any detail the many other suggestions which have from time to time been proposed for the purpose of stimulating Empire trade ; no short investigation of such matters would suffice. We are, however, unanimous that attention should immediately be directed to the &quot;organization&quot; of the British consumer with a view to his exercising a preference for Home and Empire products, and that to this end two things are essential. On the one hand Empire produce must be identifiable as such when exposed for sale in the Home country, and on the other hand the Empire producer Overseas must recognize that the onus is on him alone of meeting the demand of the British market for quality, quantity and continuity of supplies.
The Buyer and the Seller. 9. When we examine the steps to be taken for this mobilization of the consumer we have to recognize a certain distinction between the attitude of the buyer and the seller. We think it is too readily assumed that buying and selling are governed by the factor of price only. It is true that the seller, be he producer or trader, usually seeks a purchaser for his goods at the highest price obtainable, though even in his case there enter considera-tions of goodwill and of the maintenance of demand. But the buyer, though he has an equally simple object, far more often exercises discrimination for indirect or even non-commercial reasons. This difference of attitude is indicated by the deference commonly shown by sellers to their customers. A customer gives his custom : a seller seeks it; The study of trade in any small community shows how frequently buyers give their custom to those who in turn buy from them. We think that within the Empire there is a very complete basis for discrimination of a similar kind. In buying Empire food-stuffs, British people are helping their own best friends and are giving their custom to their own best clients.The Attitude of the Consumer. 10. The evidence of our witnesses leads us to believe that as between goods of the same quality and price the consumer would undoubtedly select Empire produce if he could recognize it. This preference on the part of the consumer would, however, not as a rule operate when the goods were more expensive or inferior in quality. The interest of the producer is obviously to cater for the consumer in regard to price and quality and this is a subject we deal with in our Meat and Fruit Reports. Here we are concerned with the consumer and with the method by which he may be given a chance of exercising discrimination in favour of Empire products. In this matter the initiative must from the nature of the case lie with the consumer and not with the producer.Identification of Empire Origin. . 11. But in order that the consumer may be able to discriminate effectively he must know the origin of the wares which are put on sale. This involves the marking in some way of the goods offered to the public. There is, we think, some frequent confusion of thought on the subject of marking. In certain countries producers of goods of high quality desire a mark of origin because of the goodwill which attaches to the name of their country. This they wish whether their country be within or without the Empire. We consider it desirable, as we suggest later, to protect by law such descriptions of origin when attached by producers, and to prevent their being falsified, concealed, or removed. But the broad distinction between Empire goods and foreign goods is another matter. We seek to mark that distinction in order that the consumer may exercise his discrimination on
On the basis of the figures shown, the population of the United States would have to grow to about 400,000,000 before the consumption of British produce and manufactures equalled the present total consumption of the 27,000,000 inhabitants of the British Self-Governing Dominions.

The development of the Home market for Empire goods will stimulate the migration of the surplus population at home into the other parts of the Empire and increase the number of Britons overseas who demand the products of British industry. Three desirable results will be attained simultaneously the greater prosperity of the Overseas Empire, the better distribution of the white population within the British Commonwealth, and the better employment of the population which remains at home. But, even so, the sequence of economic benefit is not exhausted. The parts of the Empire are separated not by the narrow seas but by broad oceans, so that Imperial development makes a special demand on the services of shipping and tends to the growth of the merchant fleets on which the very existence of the Empire depends, as was shown during the Great War. Finally, it is evident that with the migration of population must also go the investment of capital and that migration within the Empire will lead to the material develop-ment of the Dominions rather than of foreign countries. As the figures given above show, this is likely to yield the maximum return on the savings of the people of the United Kingdom.This is the longsighted view which we wish to see impressed upon the consumer. He already has a sentimental preference for goods produced under the flag and in many cases by his own kith and kin. When he fully realizes that there are in addition good business reasons for buying Imperially it should not be very difficult to persuade him to convert his hitherto haphazard spending into what we conceive should be the discharge of a responsible act performed with a view to the consequences in-volved.
grounds other than or additional to those of quality and price. For this purpose the name of a country will not in our opinion suffice. The British Empire is vast and includes many territories. The housewife cannot be expected to have her school book always in mind when she is engaged in shopping. To be effective the Empire appeal should be direct and simple.,The Present Law in Regard to Identification.12. In the case of meat there is already a legal requirement in the United Kingdom,, under the Sale of Food Order, 1921, that imported meat shall be labelled as such when offered for sale.Furthermore, the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 prohibits the importation of goods bearing a &quot; false trade description &quot; as to the place or country in which any goods were made or produced, and makes it an offence to apply to any articles sold or offered for sale such a &quot; false trade description.&quot; The Act contains the following provisions : &quot; Any person who . . . applies any false trade description to goods . . . shall, subject to the provi-sions of this Act, and unless he proves that he acted without intention to defraud, be guilty of an offence against this Act.&quot; The expression &apos; trade description &apos; means any descrip-tion, statement or other indication direct or indirect . . . as to the place or country in which any goods were made or produced.   .   .   .&quot; The expression &apos; false trade description &apos; means a trade description which is false in a material respect as regards the goods to which it applies, and includes every alteration of a trade description whether by way of addition, effacement or otherwise, where that also makes the description false in a material respect.&quot; While these provisions are satisfactory so far as they go, they do not, in our opinion, go far enough.1Proposed Legislation.13. We understand that a Bill has been introduced at West-minster requiring that imported meat and certain other imported commodities shall bear a label with an indication of origin printed thereon so as to be easily readable by the purchaser. The expression &quot; indication of origin &quot; is defined in the Bill as meaning &quot; either a statement as to the country in which the goods were produced, or a statement, in the case of goods produced in any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, that the goods are Empire produce, or, in the case of goods produced in any other country, that the goods are foreign produce.&quot; This definition of the expression &quot; indication of origin &quot; appears to us to be satisfactory for the marking of goods at the time of importation.1 We reprint in Appendix III the more pertinent paragraphs from the Report of the Merchandise Marks Committee, 1920.
Indication of Origin at Point of Importation and Pointof Sale.14. But we have to deal not only with importation, but also with retail sale to the consumer. It is not necessary that the indication of Empire should be applied by the producer overseas, always provided that the country of origin is known and that the Empire label can be attached with certainty at the time of sale. We are unanimous in the view that at the time of sale the simple words &quot; Empire produce &quot; or &quot; foreign produce,&quot; as the case may be, should be attached to the goods. But in order to satisfy the anxiety of those countries within the Empire which desire to maintain the goodwill already attaching to the name of their country we would also provide that where the indication of origin at the time of importation has taken the form of &quot; a statement as to the country in which the goods were produced &quot; the retailer shall exhibit that statement below the more general indication &quot; Empire produce/&apos; Moreover it should be made an offence to falsify, remove, or conceal after importation into the United Kingdom indications of origin attached by the producer.Marking of Home Produce.15. In regard to goods produced in the United Kingdom we hesitate to make a definite proposal. Whether it is better to label goods as &quot; Home produce &quot; or to leave them unlabelled with the implication that they are of Home production is, prima facie, a matter for the consideration of the British Government. But their decision must inevitably react on the policy which we are proposing of marking Empire goods, for the absence of a label from Home produce would probably lead to negligence in the matter of labelling imported produce. We should therefore prefer to see Home produce definitely labelled, especially as that would call the attention of the consumer to his first duty, which we desire to see maintained, of supporting the Home producer.Form of Empire Indication.16. Before coming to the foregoing conclusions in regard to the indication of Empire origin, we considered alternative possibilities. There has been much discussion in the past in regard to an Empire trade-mark, and we have carefully considered the evidence for and against such a means of identification. We are unanimously of opinion that a trade-mark is not what is required for the purposes we have in view. We examined the advantages and disadvantages of emblems and colour schemes. Much has been said in favour of an emblem, but it would be extremely difficult to find a pictorial symbol, equally appropriate to all classes of goods, which would not be confused with trade-marks registered within the United Kingdom or elsewhere. The advantages of an Empire colour scheme are undeniable. If Empire goods could be marked, wrapped, or packed with a
colour or combination of colours reserved for them, the indication of origin would be clear to every consumer. There are, however, difficulties in the limitation of any particular colour or combination of colours to Empire goods, for under the existing law trade-marks may be printed in any colour. Moreover, the Customs authorities might be involved in serious disputes as to whether a particular shade did or did not infringe the Empire tint. We are, therefore, forced back upon the necessity of recommending the attachment of prescribed words to indicate Empire origin when goods are offered for sale.Legislation Required.17. So far as legislation is concerned we think that it should be of the simplest. Anything which by reason of complexity of detail has the effect of harassing the retailer would, we feel convinced, defeat its own object. Our scheme assumes a persistent demand on the part of the consumer for Empire goods, and a demand also for the means of identifying such goods. All that is needed in the way of legal enactment is to prescribe the distinguishing words, to specify the authority for issuing regulations, and to throw the legal responsibility on to the person affixing the description to the goods on sale. We would suggest that considerable discretion should be given in the matter of the regulations to be made, for even if we regard only meat and fruit it will probably be found necessary to vary such matters as the character of the label in accordance with the nature of the commodity. It would probably be necessary to bring the legislation into operation by degrees by departmental Order or otherwise after consultation with those interested.Marking of Canned Goods. 18. In the case of canned goods, and in this matter we would go beyond meat and fruit and would include also fish, we think that it is desirable to provide that each tin should be embossed with the name of the country of origin and that this name must not be effaced or covered up. But we see no reason why a label indicative of a brand should not be attached in the United Kingdom, always provided that it includes the statement of whether the contained goods are Empire produce or foreign produce. We make this recommendation because it has- been made clear to us in evidence that, notwithstanding the fact that the repute of certain brands of canned goods was originally built up on the excellence of certain Empire products, yet the brand label is now utilized to cover also foreign goods. There are, we feel, two parties who may claim an interest in what has been achieved in such cases. On the one hand, there is the first country of origin, and, on the other, there is the firm which, by care in the selection of the goods it may obtain from various sources, aims at giving a certificate of quality to the buying public. We see no reason why one of these two parties should be allowed to take the whole profit of the goodwill
Publicity.19. So far we have dealt with legislation and we have striven on the basis of existing and proposed Merchandise Marks Acts for the minimunf of- ehange. But we recognize that some driving force is necessary if the legal requirements are to be converted into a generally accepted custom. Effective education and publi-city will be required. By publicity we do not intend the direction of the notice of the consumer to the products and brands of particular firms. That is the concern of the trader. Our intention is that over and above ordinary advertising on a commercial basis there should be continuous publicity on a national scale with a view to spreading and fostering three ideas. Firstly, that Empire purchasing creates an increased demand for -the manu-factured products of the United Kingdom and therefore stimulates employment at Home. Secondly, that there are certain lines in which Empire produce excels in quality and is available in adequate quantity. Thirdly, that the consumer has at his com-mand for purposes of discrimination certain indications of origin legally prescribed. Such publicity must be continuous, for it must be remembered that a new generation is always growing up and that there will be constant efforts in the way of quickened competition on the part of foreign producers. Nor must it be stereotyped in method or it will lose its efficacy. It should also be calculated to appeal particularly to the young, so that a habit may be engendered in the coming generation.Overseas Settlement and Inter-Imperial Trade.20. In regard to the effect of Empire purchasing there is scope for a great educational effort. By selecting the sources from which he obtains his food and raw materials the consumer in the United Kingdom can exert a far-reaching influence on the whole economy of the Empire. Unless the Overseas parts of the Empire are prosperous and are finding adequate markets for their produce it is not probable that their population will greatly increase. The migration of the surplus population of the United Kingdom into the Overseas parts of the Empire rather than into foreign countries will be promoted by the development of the Home market for Empire produce. When settlers of British race remain within the Empire they continue to purchase British goods to a far greater extent than they do if they go to foreign countries. It is in the Overseas markets of the Empire more than anywhere else in the world that Britain continues to hold her own. Head for head the inhabitants of the Empire are by far the largest importers of the products of British skill and labour.The following table, based on returns which we give in greater detail in Appendix II, brings out this fact with undeniable emphasis. In this table under the head of Self-Governing Dominions are included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Newfoundland and the Irish Free State.
Supplies of Empire Produce. 21. In paragraph 19 we indicated that publicity is needed not merely in connexion with the broad educational effort to induce Empire buying, but also in regard to selected commodities. Action with a view to increasing the consumption of Empire produce cannot be treated as a question apart. If there is one principle which has lately been more emphasized than another by experts in advertisement it is that advertisement fails and money is thrown away unless the advertisement and organization of business are closely interlocked. To be effective, publicity must be supported both by excellence of quality and by regularity of supplies.Quality and Presentation.22. In regard to quality, it must be borne in mind that the pioduction of some kinds of goods has reached a higher stage of development within the Empire than the production of other kinds. As we have already said, the consumer, however well disposed to buy Imperially, cannot in the vast majority of cases afford to do so unless satisfied in regard to price and quality. It must therefore be recognized that identification is accompanied by responsibilities as well as privileges. There is no more certain way of driving an inferior product from the market than by indicating its origin in such manner as that the consumer will recognize it whenever it is offered for sale. We are convinced that the Overseas parts of the Empire can produce goods as excellent in quality, as efficiently prepared, and as attractively presented as the goods produced in any other parts of the world, but, as our enquiries into the marketing of meat and fruit have already shown, there is still room for improvement. We strongly re-commend that the Overseas Governments of the Empire should continue to encourage the better grading, packing and presenta-tion of goods in order that they may secure the full advantage which identification will provide. Given identification, it cannot be too strongly urged that the onus of quality and presentation rests wholly upon the producer.Regularity and Continuity of Supply.23. But excellence of quality alone will not suffice. There must, as we have already said, be regularity and continuity of supply. It is clear that publicity undertaken in respect of foodstuffs which are irregular in supply and insufficient in quantity will merely cause disappointment and dissatisfaction. It appears to us that there is scope for useful correlation of supplies from different parts of the Empire so as to prolong the number of months during which Empire produce of any given kind may be on offer in the shops. As a general proposition we are informed by the experts that advertisement is efficacious very much in proportion to its persistence ; but obviously persistent advertis e -ment would be comparatively useless without continuity of supply.
The Mobilization of the Consumer.24. To a limited degree the conversion of purchasing into a responsible act has been found practicable with one large body of British consumers. The Co-operative movement within Great Britain has, we are told, so far organized responsible buying as to exclude sweated goods made in the United Kingdom and to insist that the contents and quality of any article offered for sale shall be true to its description. On a relatively small scale also there have been some interesting and successful experiments by other organizations under the designation of &quot; Empire Shopping Weeks &quot; and so forth, but apart from these efforts the consumer is still without guidance. We think that if he is properly informed and assisted he will become a most potent factor in Empire trade. Our task is to win his interest and to show him that he has an economic advantage to gain when he purchases Empire goods.&quot;Organization.25. While we believe that the producers of the Empire desire to do everything in their power to promote the sale of their goods within the Empire and while we think that everything possible should be done to enlist the sympathy and assistance of the retailer in the United Kingdom, it is, as we have said, from the ultimate purchaser and consumer that we look for the motive force. The success of the partial experiments to which we have referred is an indication that the time has come for a movement on a national scale. We are proposing, therefore, in our re-commendations to the British Government, as set out in the fourth part of this Report, that rather more than half of the proposed annual grant in regard to which we are asked to advise shall be devoted to the purpose of inaugurating such a national movement. We recognize that at the present time all proposals involving new administrative machinery should be carefully scrutinized and should be as little costly as possible. The simpler and more flexible the machinery the better will it serve our pur-pose. We therefore propose a body modelled on such precedents as the Development Commission and the Forestry Commission already at work in Great Britain. It is, we believe, customary to give greater freedom in certain respects to such a Commission than to an ordinary Government Department which is necessarily subject to detailed Treasury supervision.Executive Commission.26. In the remainder of this Report we shall refer to the proposed body as the Executive Commission. We use the word &quot; Executive &quot; in order to mark the difference of its functions from those with which we, the Imperial Economic Committee, have been entrusted. Our duty is advisory only, and we are responsible to all the Governments of the Empire. We contem-plate that the Executive Commission should carry out those of
our recommendations which apply specially to the United Kingdom, and that, since it would be spending the British taxpayers money, it would owe responsibility to the British Parliament. None the less, we trust that means will be devised whereby the views of the Overseas Governments of the Empire may from time to time be brought to bear in an advisory way on the problems involved.Duties of Executive Commission.27. The Executive Commission would have charge of the current administration of the campaign of publicity and education. It would be in touch with the retailers in the different trades with a view to finding remedies for the practical difficulties which are certain to be encountered. It should also be in touch with the representatives in Great Britain of the producers overseas, since their co-operation will be essential. It would further be charged with the duty of seeing that the system was so work id as to take into account the interests of the Home producer. In view of these duties, it is our opinion that a distinction should be maintained between the Department of Government to be charged with the enforcement of the law in regard to marking and the relatively free and flexible body, the new Commission, to be entrusted with the duties of publicity and education. The same body cannot with advantage undertake the duty of both policeman and propagandist,&apos; but the Department and the Commission would, of course, frequently consult.Executive Commission and Trade Organizations.28. The Executive Commission must not only be flexible in its methods but it must also be strong and independent. Many interests may seek to take advantage of its position and attempt to use it on behalf of sectional &quot;and private schemes. Its character must therefore be such as to secure public confidence. We think that it should be a small body, and that no attempt should be made to secure the representation upon it of all the many competing interests. We would provide for consultation with the trade interests concerned in regard to such matters as the details of any particular advertising campaign by means of joint com-mittees on a commodity basis. This would ensure that the experience of distributors as well as of producers was utilized by the new body. Such joint sub-committees would, moreover, be of great assistance to the Commission in keeping it informed of developments in the trades concerned and advising it of changes in public taste.Executive Commission and Voluntary Workers.29. We do not doubt that in their schemes for publicity the Commission will receive offers of assistance from voluntary workers. We believe that such assistance, under suitable guidance, would be of great value to the Commission.   There is
always a danger, however, with voluntary workers that a move-ment may be utilized and penetrated by trade and sectional interests, and the Commission will have to guard against the possibility of such a danger. We are clear that voluntary effort alone will not suffice. But the precedent of the National Savings Organization illustrates how voluntary effort may, with great advantage, be enlisted to second a movement organized on a national basis.Freedom the Basis of the Proposed Scheme., 30. There is arising in the United Kingdom a widespreadrecognition of the economic benefits to be derived from buying within the Empire. Our plan seeks to translate this latent feeling into a practical scheme under State guidance and on a scale commensurate with the productive facilities of the Empire. The scheme rests on the free will of the individual citizen as consumer. In proportion as he is convinced of the wisdom of the underlying policy will the movement be effectual. But there is freedom also on the side of the producer, be he British or foreign, and there is nothing in the plan to destroy individual enterprise or competition. On the contrary, an ever-increasing efficiency is postulated if the producers within the Empire are to hold their own with the producers outside. In providing facilities to enable a voluntary discrimination to be exercised by its citizens, the Government of the United Kingdom would be attempting to achieve by methods of freedom no more than other countries seek to compass by their customs tariffs.III.   RESEARCH.The Importance of Research.31. We are impressed by the paramount importance of research in solving the problems of the food supplies of the Empire. Much has already been done by pioneers in the work, but the field is so vast that what has already been achieved is small indeed in comparison with that which has still to be undertaken. In the course of our investigations we have chosen the subject of cold storage for special consideration, because of its obvious immediate importance to the marketing and preparing for market of meat and fruit. We have had before us the views of Sir Frank Heath, the Secretary of the Department of Industrial and Scientific Research, and those of Sir William Hardy, the Director of the Low Tempera-ture Station for Research in Biochemistry and Biophysics at Cambridge. We have also visited the Cambridge Low Temperature Station. In what follows, we refer by way of illustration to cold storage especially, but we are fully conscious of the magnitude and importance of other fields of inquiry in regard to which we have received information from various sources and notably from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
Need for Financial Assistance.32. The resources in men and money at present available are small as compared with the extent of the problems awaiting investigation. We are convinced that money devoted to research will bring to producer and consumer alike benefits out of all pro-portion to the sums expended. We have therefore included in our recommendations to the British Government the allocation out of the annual grant of a substantial sum for research.Nature of the Problem.33. Research on the comparatively large scale which we have in mind must depend upon two considerations (i) the number of competent workers who can be secured, and (ii) the amount of money available for carrying promising scientific results up to full-scale practice. Since the effective marketing of Empire food-stuffs involves three classes of interest the overseas producer, the transporter by ship and railway, and the distributor in the United Kingdom it is essential to direct research to the problems of all these classes and therefore to carry the scientific results into practice by way of demonstration not only in the United Kingdom, but also, so far as they are relevant, in the producing country and in transit by rail and sea. But demonstration alone will not suffice ; fundamental scientific work will be needed in the pro-ducing country as well as in the consuming country, and each will support and stimulate the other.Work to be Undertaken.34. Beginnings have already been made, particularly in regard to fruit. Schemes are in operation for scientific work in Australia and South Africa, and men from Overseas are being trained both there and in the United Kingdom. Moreover, experimental work has been done on shipboard between Australia and the United Kingdom. Close co-operation has also been established in Great Britain between the Food Investigation Board of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and cold stores in various parts of the country. But more than this is needed. The pro-gramme before the Food Investigation Board should be extended and enlarged as soon as the right men are available. Some extension of the Low Temperature Research Station at Cambridge is necessary, and, in addition, facilities will have to be provided for cold storage experiments on a commercial scale at the ports, on shipboard, and on the railways both in Great Britain and overseas.-General Scheme of Research.35. Although the Low Temperature Research Station at Cambridge is not on a commercial scale, yet we regard it as a central organization for staff work in connexion with the general scheme of research on the larger scale. Its very promising and valuable work is being handicapped by inadequate laboratory
and cold storage space and insufficient personnel. We think, therefore, that it should be assisted in connexion with our general scheme. We have obtained from Sir William Hardy, its accom-plished Director, the following list of problems directly connected with cold storage which are awaiting attack : (a) Experiments into the chilling of meat.(b) Further experiments into the freezing of meat.(c) Combined chilling and freezing experiments on meat.(d) The possibility of long distance carriage of pig products to the United Kingdom from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as from Canada.(e) Gas storage of fruit on a commercial scale, and the possibility of providing suitable accommodation for such storage on board ship.(/) The freezing of fruit in lieu of pulping. (g) Effect of breed and previous history upon storage and marketing qualities of meat and fruit.The subject of cold storage does not by any means, as we have already said, exhaust the field of research. There is for instance the whole vast question of the diseases of animals and fruit. In regard to this we need only refer to the many research stations in the United Kingdom alone, at the Universities and elsewhere, which are in connexion with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Provision of Trained Investigators.36. Money will be thrown away on research if an adequate supply of trained investigators is not forthcoming. We are convinced that in this vast Empire men are available who are prepared to devote their lives to patient and often apparently fruitless inquiry if a competence and the chance of a career is offered to them. It must be in the industries themselves that careers will be provided. Men trained in the sciences which underlie the commercial operations are needed not only for research but as the interpreters of the research of others, just as in the profession of medicine there are general practitioners as well as specialists. There should be no hard and fast line between those who do research.and those who &quot;practise.&quot; In regard to cold storage, for instance, some of the most valuable contri-distributors to research will be those who return to the laboratory after a period of work in the packing stations of the Dominions, or on board the refrigerated ships, or in the refrigerated stores at the Home ports. Their places in the business world would be taken by men from the laboratories alive to the recent advances of knowledge and on the watch to translate those advances into practice. Thus would be constituted an intelligence service both for the laboratories and for commerce. The food industry needs consultants with a biological (biochemical and biophysical)
training that is to say, men who know the structure and chem-istry of flesh, something of the physiology and ailments of cattle, and the physiology and diseases of fruit. With a view to recruiting the new calling of food experts, we think that a portion of the money set aside fry- research could usefully be devoted to the establishment of studentships to enable selected graduates of the Universities of the Empire, who have taken a First CV-ss Honours Degree or its equivalent, to work for one, two or three years at Cambridge or at one of the other available research stations. A small annual expenditure on such intellectual cross fertilization of the various parts of the Empire would bring a great return. Large scale experimental work will also offer opportunity for the training of men intending to enter one or other branch of the industry on the technical side.Imperial Co-ordination of Research.37. It will be seen, therefore, from what has been said in the preceding paragraphs that we contemplate a co-ordinated Imperial scheme for the application of science to the food industries. From the centre outwaxds we would have ; first, the research station proper ; then, the experimental application on a commercial scale ; and, lastly, the trade at large. Covering all three of these stages,-we wish to have developed a body of men, in fact an organized profession, trained at the Universities, specialized at the research stations, practised in research on a commercial scale, and utilized and rewarded in the trade at large. A diploma of high standard after a course of post-graduate instruction might perhaps with advantage be established at one of our Universities, and we should hope that there would come into existence a Professional Institution which would play the same part in the food industry as that played by the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in their industries. It must be remembered that the trade in foodstuffs is on a vast scale. Great Britain pays for imported meat alone more than  100,000,000 a year.Inter-Imperial Go-operatio n&apos;.38. Such a profession with its associated specialist schools -an 1 research stations would give not merely a paper scheme of co-ordination, but a real unification and tradition in research and practice throughout the Empire. In each part, of the Empire organization would doubtless be adapted to local conditions, but the come and go of personnel would ensure identity of aim and of standards and would tend to prevent useless repetition, since the expert advisers would everywhere be members of a single scientific corps. The elements of such a system already exist. The need for the widening of experience has found partial expres-sion in the movement started in Canada for interchange of workers on fishery problems as between the United Kingdom and
Canada. The South African Government has recently sent a member of its scientific staff for a year at the Cambridge Low Temperature Research Station, and a member of the staff of that Station has been lent to Australia.Control and Organization of Research.39. We contemplate that the ultimate responsibility for the expenditure of that portion of the.British Government grant which we recommend- should be allocated for research should rest with the Executive Commission. They will be the co-ordinating body and will also see that practical and commercial considerations are not lost sight of. But it is essential that scientific men should have full scope and responsibility in regard to research proper. We think, therefore, that while Parliament would look to the Executive Commission for a general supervision, there should be a joint standing Committee formed by the addition of a few scientific men of the first order to a Committee of the Commission. In what way these scientific men should be selected is a matter for the consideration of the British Government, but we may perhaps venture on the suggestion that they might be appointed by the Lord President of the Council in his capacity of Chairman of the new Civil Research Committee. It might otherwise be necessary to provide for the representation of quite a number of institutions engaged in research.IV.   FINANCE.Recommendations to British Government.40. The preceding sections of this Report have been addressed to all the Governments of the Empire. We think it proper to address this section to the British Government alone, and to recapitulate in it the advice in regard to financial expenditure which we have been asked to tender to that Government.Annual. Grant of British Government.41. As already pointed out in paragraph 3, we have not been instructed to treat our task under this head as merely one of compensating the industries which would have benefited under the abandoned preferences, although there is undoubtedly a feeling among some of those engaged in the industries to which the lapsed preference proposals related that some direct assistance might properly be given to them. A million a year would, however, break up into relatively trivial sums if distributed among a number of industries in different parts of the Empire, and we feel, moreover, that any scheme of direct subsidy to the producers would involve considerable difficulties both on constitutional and on practical grounds.   We believe that more
permanent benefit to those industries, and Certainly to Empire trade at large, would accrue from the utilization of this sum in a more general manner. Our aim is to stimulate the demand for Empire products, and it is with this object in view that we have contemplated the allocation of large portions of money to publicity and research, where the return to the individual producer is less easy to measure but none the less valuable in the long run. But we recognize that our general schemes will take a little time to develop, and we therefore commend the industries which were disappointed of a preference under the Customs tariff of the United Kingdom to the early attention of the Executive Commission.Provisional Nature of Allocation of Grant.42. From a financial point of view, we think that the Executive Commission which we are proposing will form a convenient and, indeed, a necessa^ instrument for at least two reasons. In the first place, experience alone will show in what directions the annual grant may most profitably be spent, and this experience can only be gained by practical work in the execution of carefully prepared schemes. In the second place, we believe that it is in accordance with precedent that, out of the funds voted to a Commission such as we propose, any surplus which may remain unexpended at the end of the financial year should be carried forward and should not fall back into the Treasury. Our investigations are not yet complete, and we may have to suggest further schemes to which a portion of the grant might in the future be devoted. The initial cost of some of the schemes may be greater than the cost of continuing them ; or, on the other hand, there may be schemes which will gradually expand from small beginnings. For these reasons among others we think that the whole sum should be voted to the Executive Commission, which should be charged with the duty of carrying out those of our proposals which apply to the United Kingdom, but with power to vary within elastic limits the initial allocation which we suggest. We think it very important that the Commission should be able to commit itself to schemes which would develop gradually over a short term of years.Allocation of Annual Grant.43. Subject to what we have said in the preceding paragraph, we think that the annual grant should be assigned in the first instance to the following purposes : (1) To publicity and education for the promotion of Empire buying.(2) To research, chiefly on a commercial scale.
(3) To other schemes such as : (a) The development of trade in fruit produced in the tropical portions of the Empire.(b) The carriage of pedigree stock from the United Kingdom to the Overseas parts of the Empire.(c) Any other scheme within our terms of reference which we may subsequently recommend.In setting out our proposals in the above order, we have had in view the fact that the promotion of Empire buying in the United Kingdom should react on all parts of the Overseas Empire, ^nd for that reason we propose to assign to this purpose the greater part of the grant. In regard to research, we think that it would probably be difficult to spend wisely at short notice a very large sum. It may well be that as the movement fdr Empire buying becomes organized and efficient it will cost less, and that as research develops it will make larger demands. We have thought it desirable to mark the interest of all the self-governing portions of the Empire and of India in our great dependent tropical estateby including a scheme on which we hope to report later. We also desire, as explained at greater length in our Report on Meat, to give support to the improvement of the live-stock of the Empire by contributing to the cost of the carriage of pedigree animals. While this should be of great value to the Dominion producer, itwould also be of advantage to the British breeder. We propose, for the guidance of the Executive Commission, that in the first instance about 65 per cent, of the annual grant should be devoted to the promotion of Empire buying in the United Kingdom ; that about 15 per cent, should go to research; and that the remaining 20 per cent, should be reserved for the other schemes. The costs of the Commission itself would, we anticipate, be very small, and would, of course, be a charge on these schemes.Interest of Different Parts of the Empire.44. While our two major schemes should benefit all parts of the Empire we recognize that our other schemes are of more local application, The importation of meat and fruit into the. United Kingdom is from certain parts of the Empire only. We think it important therefore to say that as our investigations proceed to other foodstuffs it is likely that we shall have further schemes to propose. As a body of delegates from all parts of the Empire we have deliberately worked with the Empire as a whole in our minds ; but while we have excluded all spirit of bargaining we are anxious that as far as may be no part of the Empire shall feel that it has been omitted from consideration. We have still to review many industries, such as the tea trade and the fish trade, in which portions of the Empire not prominently concerned in the export of meat and fruit are interested.
V.   SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.45. We summarize the conclusions and recommendations of this our first Report as follows : (1) That the time is ripe for a national effort to stimulate the consumption of Empire produce in the United Kingdom.(2) That so far as the State is concerned this scheme should rest on (a) legal requirements with a view to the identification of Empire goods; and (b) financial assistance for education and publicity, and that we regard these two factors as essential the one to the other.(3) That the law of the United Kingdom, if enforced, already supplies the greater part of the necessary sanctions.(4) That the. Merchandise Marks (Imported Agricultural Produce) Bill at present before Parliament at Westminster forms a very convenient basis for.the further legislation which it seems to us would be necessary.(5) That the enforcement of the law in respect of marking at the time of importation and in respect of labelling at the time of retail sale should rest with one of the existing De-partments of State.(6) That a Commission, which we speak of provisionally as the Executive Commission&apos;, should be formed on the model of the existing Development and Forestry Commissions for the purpose of supervising the expenditure of the annual grant from the British Parliament.(7) That this Commission should be charged with the duty of conducting the movement for trade in Empire produce.(8) That we regard a scheme for co-ordinated research into the production and preservation of foodstuffs as of prime importance.(9) That the Executive Commission should -start by allocating about 65 per cent, of the annual grant for the promotion of trade in Empire produce and about 15 per cent, for research.(10) That the remaining 20 per cent, should be reserved for certain other schemes of which we have mentioned two, namely the promotion of fruit growing in the tropical por-tions of the Empire and the carriage of pedigree stock from the United Kingdom ,to the Overseas parts of the Empire.

NOTE BY SUB-COMMITTEE ON FRUIT ON THE PROGRESS MADE IN THE INQUIRY INTO THE MARKETING OF EMPIRE FRUIT TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS AND   RECOMMENDATIONS.It has not yet been possible to complete the Report on Empire fruit. So far as is known there has not hitherto been any attempt to make a comprehensive official survey of Empire fruit supplies as a whole. It has, therefore- been necessary to begin at the beginning and to take ex-tensive evidence in. order to reach the same stage as has been achieved in the case of foodstuffs which have already been the subject of official investigations.In the meantime it appears desirable to state certain views bearing on the foregoing Report on which the Sub-Committee are agreed as the result of their investigations thus far into the fruit question.1. The Sub-Committee are convinced that there is a wide-spread sentiment among consumers in this country in favour of purchasing by choice, fruits of Home and Empire origin.2. The Sub-Committee are satisfied that a well planned and comprehensive-sive scheme of educational publicity and advertising would go a long way in the direction of converting latent Imperial sentiment into such effective action as would result in increasing the demand for Home and Empire fruits.3. The Sub-Committee are further convinced that the identification by the consumer of Home and Empire fruit as such is the essential preliminary to securing the preferential consumption of such fruit in the United Kingdom.4. If identification is to be an advantage and not a dis-service to the Empire producer there must be high standards of grading and presentation of Empire products. This is emphatically true in regard to fruit. For identification to be of real value to producer and consumer alike, it is a matter of the most serious moment that the quality and packing of Empire fruit should be at least as good as those of competing foreign products. Any failure in these respects would strike at the basis on which rest the recommendations embodied in this Report. The Sub-Committee, there-fore, regard it as of the utmost importance that the Governments of the Overseas parts of the Empire should encourage their producers to take effective steps to set and maintain the highest possible standard in regard to the production, grading, and packing of their fruit.5. If the advertising of fruit is to be really effective and of permanent advantage to Empire producers there must be regularity and continuity of supplies, although the fact that certain fruits are seasonal in supply will have to be borne in mind. No difficulty is likely to arise in the case of such fruits as are forthcoming from Empire sources in steady supply and in adequate quantities during the greater part of the year. This, however, will not apply to other fruits, the advertising of which will therefore have to be a development strictly conditioned by available supplies.6. The importance of further research into problems of transportation and storage, and in certain cases into production, can hardly be over-emphasised.   A striking example of the commercial value of scientific
research has been provided by the work done by scientists from the Cam-bridge Low Temperature Research Station on shipments of Australian apples to the United Kingdom. Continuous and sustained efforts to improve existing, and devise better, conditions of transport and storage would be of the very greatest advantage both to the Empire producer and to the British consumer.7. The Sub-Committee are convinced from the evidence they have taken that by organisation from the point of production to the point of sale, supported by efficient marketing and well planned advertising, and based upon the clear identification by the consumer of the origin of fruit supplies, the Home and Empire fruit industry can be placed on a much more secure and progressive basis than has been the experience of fruit growers in the past. The consumption of fruit is substantially increasing amongst all sections of the population of the United Kingdom and the weight of the evidence taken shows that so long as price and quality are satisfactory British people prefer British and Empire goods.NOTE ON STATISTICAL APPENDICES.Appendix I deals with the importation of foodstuffs into the United Kingdom.Table 1 has been drawn up to show the Empire&apos;s share in the principal imports of Food, Drink and Tobacco into the United Kingdom. The year 1923 is the most recent year for which the detailed statistics are available.In Table 2 the reference in paragraph 2 of the Report has been elaborated. That reference indicated by means of percentage figures the margin between the supplies available from the British production of foodstuffs and the total requirements of the United Kingdom. In this table the quantities are given for the year 1924.-Appendix II deals with the British export trade. It has been compiled to illustrate the general argument of this Report, and particularly the statements in regard to the- xalue of Empire trade made in paragraphs 9, 20, 24 and&apos; 30.In Table 3 the percentage share of the Empire. in the purchases of British exports is given. The growing importance of the Empire markets to British industry is shown by the increase from 34-75 per cent., annual average 1904-13, to 39-4 per cent. (Irish Free State excluded) in the first six months of. 1925.Table 4 shows for the year 1923 (the latest available detailed figures) the Empire share of British exports in the three Board of Trade Classifications : Class I; Food, Drink and Tobacco. ,,   II. Raw Materials and Articles mainly unmanufactured. III. Articles wholly or mainly manufactured. In Table 5 the importance of the market provided for British goods by the several Dominions, India and the Crown Colonies is contrasted with that of certain foreign countries or groups of countries.   This has special reference to the statements made in paragraph 20 of this Report.Table 6 elaborates the reference in paragraph 20 of this Report to per capita purchases. The figures in paragraph 20 represent the average per capita purchases of British goods by all the Self-Governing Dominions for 1924, and contrast these purchases with those of certain foreign countries and groups of countries. In this Table the per capita purchases of British goods by the same countries or groups of countries as are given in the preceding table are shown for the year 1924.

Merchandise Marks Legislation and Report of Merchandise Marks Committee, 1920.In our Report reference is made to the provisions of the Merchandise Marks legislation of the United Kingdom. We have also had occasion to consult the Report of the Merchandise Marks Committee, 1920.1 That Report contains the following views which have some bearing on the recommendations put forward in this Report : 1 Note. Report of the Merchandise Marks Committee (Cmd. 760).Detection of Offences and  Prosecutions by  Government Departments, Local Authorities and Others.&quot; The view has been repeatedly pressed upon us that more active steps are necessary for the detection of offences against the Act. The Board of Trade, who are the prosecuting authority under the Merchandise Marks Act, 1891, have no staff of inspectors or detectives, and rely for information as to breaches of the Act upon particulars furnished to them by Trade Associations and others. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, who are empowered to prosecute in certain cases by the Merchandise Marks (Prosecutions) Act, 1894, and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries Act, 1903, have no special staff for this purpose, but, before the war, utilized the services of five inspectors, who were also employed in connexion with the enforcement of other Acts. On the other hand, the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, whose powers to prosecute are given by the Merchandise Marks (Ireland) Act, 1909, have employed a special staff of inspectors, both in this country and in Ireland.&quot; There would be considerable difficulty in setting up machinery under the direct control of Central Departments in Great Britain for the detection of offences under the Act. Any such machinery, to be reasonably adequate for the purpose, would have to be extensive, and would involve the maintenance of a large staff of inspectors and experts.&quot; Local authorities, as was pointed out to us by the witness who attended on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, are in a much more favourable position than Central Departments to detect cases of false description. They have inspectors in their employment who are possessed of both expert and local knowledge which would enable them to detect false marking, and who are in a position to keep under constant observation a business in which false marking is suspected. Moreover, such bodies now administer the, Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and would no doubt find the power of prosecuting under the Merchandise Marks Act a useful supplement to the powers they already possess.&quot; We think, therefore, that Local Authorities should be authorized to act for the detection of offences in their own area, and also to prosecute, and to charge the expenses to the rates. The powers of prosecuting possessed by the.Central Departments should, however, be retained, as it is desirable that such Departments should continue to deal with cases involving national or other wide interests.&quot; It should be possible for prosecutions to be undertaken, not only by Public Authorities who have been specially authorized to spend public money for the purpose, but also by any person, association, or organization, whether directly interested or not, on behalf of a trade or person aggrieved. This is probably the position to-day, but it would be well to have it made clear on the face of the Act.Legal Proceedings and Remedies.
At present a prosecutor must commence his proceedings in the police -court, although, under Section 2 (6) of the Act, a person charged with an offence may elect to be tried on indictment. The unsuitability of a police court for the trial of cases involving difficult and important questions of law and fact has more than once been insisted upon before us, and we think that power should also be given to the High Court to deal with all questions under the Act by way of Injunction or Declaration. At the same time, any person aggrieved by the offence should have the right to sue for and recover the damages sustained, if any..&quot; A trial before the High Court would ensure that important questions arising under the Act would receive high judicial consideration, and. the principles of the decision given would have an authority which the present decisions cannot by their nature possess.&quot; Where the name of a town, district or place has been deceptively used, the Local Authority or any person or association, if authorized for the purpose by&apos;the Board of Trade, should be deemed to be a person aggrieved. We think that such an authorization should be pre-requisite to an action in such a case in order to prevent traders from being unduly harassed by actions or threats of actions from irresponsible quarters.&quot; The possibility of commencing an action in the High Court would probably enable the Irish Industrial Development Association to overcome the difficulty they have experienced in taking action against English companies for breaches of the Merchandise Marks Act in Ireland, owing to the fact that an Irish Magistrate cannot issue a summons for service in England.&quot; We concur with the Irish Industrial Development Association that it would be an advantage if the amount recoverable by way of costs in a Petty Sessions Court in Ireland could, in proper cases, exceed the present limit of 20s. where prosecutions under the Merchandise Marks Act are concerned, as such prosecutions frequently entail considerable expense.&quot; * * * * * *a
19199 REPORT OF ECONOMIC COMMITTEE-Galley 15&quot; Compulsory marking.&quot; On consideration,, therefore, we recommend that when it has been established after an official inquiry, that it is in the public interest that the local origin of the goods should be indicated in the case of a particular description or class of imported goods, the Board of Trade should have powers to deal with the question by Order.&quot; The powers should be wide enough in cases where the official inquiry has shown that the circumstances shall require to enable an Order or Orders to be made (1) requiring an indication of origin (either specific or general) to be given ; and specifying(2) the kind, description or class of goods in respect of which such indication is to be given,(3) the form of indication,(4) the manner in which the indication is to be given, whether by a mark to be placed upon the goods, or in some other manner,(5) the time or occasion when the indication is to be given and in particular whether the indication is to be given on importation only or also on sale of the goods, either by wholesale or retail, in this country ;  and(6) exempting any particular kind, description or class of goods, e.g. goods in transit, from all or any of the requirements of the Order, either absolutely or subject to such conditions as may be called for in the public interest. &quot; In the course of the official enquiry ample opportunities should be given to all parties interested or affected to put forward arguments and evidence for or against the proposed Order and particular attention should be directed to the question whether the goods are manufactured, produced, or sold under circumstances constituting unfair competition.&quot;* * * * * *&quot; Existing, national marks.&quot;Of marks which are marks of quality, as well as of origin, we may mention the Swedish, Danish and Dutch butter and pork or bacon marks which are owned or controlled by the Governments of the respective countries, and are placed only upon products of the countries which attain a certain standard of quality. The marks used upon pickled herrings under the control of the Fishery Board for Scotland and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland, respectively, are also standardising marks as well as marks of origin. Such Government owned or controlled marks are in the nature of hall marks, and, so far as our information goes, they appear to have served a useful purpose in the circumstances in which they have been used.&quot;The French national mark &quot; UNIS-France&quot; is administered by a union of trade associations, and is primarily a mark of French origin, although its use is prohibited on inferior goods the sale of which would be likely to injure the reputation of other goods bearing the mark. Various opinions have been expressed before us as to the success which has attended this mark. We consider, however, that the mark has not been in existence long enough to justify a conclusion as to its utility and practical effect. This is true also of the &quot; SPES &quot; mark of Switzerland which closely corresponds to it.&quot;The Irish national mark, while primarily purely a mark denoting Irish Origin, does, according to the evidence of the Secretary of the Irish In-dustrial Development Association, who administer the mark, also indicate quality, in the sense that goods bearing it. can usually be relied upon to be free from adulterants. The witnesses who appeared for the Irish Depart-ment of Agriculture told us that this mark has been most useful to Irish manufacturers and a great help to Irish industry, and this is borne out by the evidence which has been put before us by the Irish Industrial Develop-ment Association itself. We do not think, however, that it is possible to argue from the case of Ireland, which is mainly an agricultural country possessing relatively few manufactures,, to that of Great Britain with its complex industrial system and its large export trade.&quot; Proposal for United Kingdom or British Empire mark.&quot; No experience has yet been gained anywhere of the use of a mark at all comparable with a national mark for the United Kingdom or a British Empire mark, from which deductions as to the probable utility and effect of such a national or Empire mark could safely be drawn, and the arguments which have been placed before us for and against a national mark for this country or Empire have, in the main, been of a theoretical character.&quot; The case on each side has been very fully argued, and the principal points made may be shortly stated as follows : :&quot; In support of the proposal, it has been claimed that such a mark, which should be purely a mark of origin, and the use of which should be optional, would serve to utilise in the interests of British industry the natural preference for British goods which exists within the Empire and the reputation which British goods have gained almost universally abroad. Such a mark, it is contended, could be used in conjunction with ordinary trade marks, and would serve to protect them from infringement, because an imitator of the the combination would run the risk of conflict with the powerful body behind the national mark.- _
not fail to become regarded as a mark of quality and that if it were used indiscriminately on goods of all qualities, inferior goods would receive an unfair advantage at the expense of the better class goods. The use of the mark with private trade marks would, it is said, lessen their distihctiveness and thus impair their value, a value which they have acquired as the result of considerable effort and expenditure oh the part of the firms whose goods they identify. The traders with the Far Eastern and African markets who have appeared before us have been unanimous in contending that an additional mark upon the labels which have already become known to native purchasers would be disastrous to the business which has been built up around those labels. It is also objected that the many important firms who would refuse to use the mark would be liable to have the origin of their goods misrepresented. It is urged that all the advantages claimed for the mark could be obtained by manufacturers marking their goods &apos;&apos; British made.&quot; Special objections are also put forward to a British national mark administered or controlled by State authorities.&apos;&apos; It would be extremely difficult to compare the weights of these opposing arguments, and we do not consider that we are called upon to essay the task, because no proposal which has been so far put forward for a national mark in this country has secured anything approaching general acceptance on the part of the trading community, and in the absence of agreement among the bulk of the traders concerned we see grave objections to the institution of a British national or Empire mark, particularly one, which -is to be under the control and administration of a private Association.&quot; *. * * * * *

INTRODUCTION.1. Under our Terms of Reference we have been asked to consider the possibility of improving the methods of preparing for market and marketing within the United Kingdom the food products of the overseas parts of the Empire with a view to increasing the consumption of such products in the United Kingdom in preference to imports from foreign countries, and to promote the interests both of producers and consumers. It has further been agreed that attention should in the first place be concentrated on meat and fruit.2. To facilitate inquiries in accordance with our terms of reference, we decided, at our meeting on the 2nd of April 1925, to appoint a Sub-Committee consisting of those of our members having special experience of the Meat Industry, to make closer investigation into questions specially affecting meat. In sub-mitting this Report we have therefore had at our disposal not merely the evidence which was taken from producers, importers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers, but also the special experience of certain of our members in regard to the conditions holdin
in various parts of the Empire.3. In our First Report we have deatt with the purchaser in the United Kingdom. In the present Report we propose to have in mind chiefly the producer in the Overseas parts of the Empire. No doubt much of the information we have collated and the con-clusions we have drawn therefrom will be matters of commonplace knowledge in those parts of the Empire which produce the several descriptions of meat. Nevertheless, since our Report will be read in all parts of the Empire we think it advisable to set out the whole position as we see it.We shall begin by considering the nature and extent of the foreign competition in the United kingdom market.   We shall By the term United Kingdom, wherever used in this Report, we mean Great Bit tain and Northern Ireland.then review the supplies from within the Empire of the different kinds of meat beef, mutton and lamb, pork, bacon and ham. In this section we shall include a reference to canned fish, in view of the preference proposals put forward at the time of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923. Finally, we shall set out our conclusions and recommendations.We shall give the reasons which in our opinion underlie the success achieved by the various meat-supplying countries of the world, and we think that certain principles of action will emerge, on which the development of increased Empire trade may be built. These principles will not run counter to the healthy corn-petition which is so important to the consumer, and in the final analysis also to the producers both at home and in the overseas parts of the Empire.

The increase in population of the United Kingdom in the last ten years has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in the flocks and herds. The population of the territory of Great Britain and of that part of Ireland which is now under the Northern Government is estimated to have been about 42,280,000 in 19111 and in 1924 about 45,000,000. The number of livestock in the territory in question is estimated to have been as follows : 1 This year is taken as being the middle year of the period 1909-13, to which most of the pre-war statistics quoted in this Report relate.Table I.	1911.	1924.Cattle          . .       . .       . .

To meet the growing deficiency in home supplies, increasing quantities of meat are imported into the United Kingdom from various parts of the globe.

Meat is imported either alive or dead. Stock may be shipped alive and slaughtered upon ^arrival, as in the case of cattle, and to a smaller extent sheep and lambs, from the Irish Free State, Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the United States. In 1909 about 205,000 live cattle from the United States and about 114,000 from Canada were imported into the United Kingdom. These numbers fell in 1913 to 10,000 head from the United States and 1,800 from Canada. The trade was renewed in 1921, and in 1924 there were imported 1,859 cattle from the United States and 76,978 from Canada, the imports from the United States being a great reduction, and those from Canada a large increase, on the imports of the three preceding years.Alternatively, supplies may be forwarded as dead meat, either from neighbouring countries (in which case they arrive in fresh condition and compete in the market with home-killed supplies) or from more distant countries, whence supplies are received in a &quot; chilled,&quot; &quot; frozen &quot; or otherwise preserved condition.Some 56 per cent, of the beef and veal, 59 pet cent, of the mutton and lamb, and 66 per cent, of the pig meat consumed in the United Kingdom are at the present time imported.7. A consideration of the import value of meat obtained from Empire and foreign sources respectively will show how great the trade is and the opportunity which exists for increasing supplies from the Empire.

19200-REPORT of Economic Committee-Gal 5 Part II.On the basis of values, the percentage shares of the several British Dominions and Possessions in the total of imported meat (both alive and dead) in 1924 were therefore as follows :  Irish Free State      ..       ..       ..       ...    19-75Canada..       ...       ..       ..       M &apos;     ..     6-87Australia       ..........3-08New Zealand..........8-91Other parts of the British Empire ..       ..     0-02making a total of 38:63 per cent., thus leaving 61-37 per cent, obtained from foreign&apos; countries.These percentages naturally differ from those drawn up on a basis of weights as given in Table IV (paragraph 5). In making these two comparisons it must also not be forgotten that the percentages in Table IV do not take account of the imports from the Irish Free State.8. It is clear from the foregoing tables that foreign countries supply considerably more than half of the meat imported into the United Kingdom. In the case of mutton and lamb, however, the importation from the Empire is predominant. It would appear that, apart from any possible increase of the consumption per head, there is room for a large measure of substitution of Empire for foreign meat. Any such change, however, must be dependent on the power of the overseas portions of the Empire to produce continuous supplies of meat of the right quality and price.3.   BEEF.9. ,In the case of beef the United Kingdom market depends to the extent of 86-7 per cent, of its imported supplies on foreign countries. As will be seen from Table V,  32,748,000 was spent on imported beef and veal in 1924, and of this sum  29,797,000 went to foreign countries.10. No enquiry into the British beef trade can proceed far without its being realized that the consumer has marked pre-ferences and that these are responsible for certain definite re-, quirements in the quality of beef demanded. It is quite clear, to begin with, that there is a preference and desire for fresh killed meat. Some indication of this may be gathered from a comparison of the average wholesale prices ruling in 1924 for the different grades1 : 1 Figures supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.First Quality. per cwt. s.    d.118   0 Scotch short&apos;sides.93   6 English.73   6 English cow and bull.91   0 Irish.91   0 Canadian and U.S.A. (U.K. port killed).64   0 Argentine chilled hind quarters.52   6 Argentine frozen hind quarters.50   0 Australian frozen hind quarters.49   0 New Zealand frozen hind quarters.Futhermore, there is an ever-growing demand for smaller joints, which has been reflected in the earlier age at which beef cattle are now marketed. The highest class of demand is for carcasses from &quot; blocky&quot; thick-set animals of &quot; beef conforma-tion,&quot; well finished, from two to three years old.11. In the various classes of imported beef chilled meat ranks in the preference of the consumer next after fresh meat. There are two reasons for this. In the first place good chilled beef very closely approaches fresh beef in the matter of condition and appearance, and in the second place it so happens that the herds of the region- from which chilled beef is obtained consist of strains which mature early and provide carcasses uniform in
type, weight, and finish.   Frozen beef as a rule suffers m com-parison with fresh and chilled beef both in quality and appearance,        &quot; owing to the present methods of freezing and defrosting.12. There are only three practicable ways of increasing the supply of fresh-killed meat, for which the United Kingdom market has a preference : (1) More extensive feeding operations on the part of farmers in the United Kingdom.(2) Increased importation of finished live cattle. (3) Increased importation of fresh-killed beef from the Irish Free State and neighbouring continental countries. In the calendar year 1924-, 932,000 cattle were imported from the Irish Free State, of which about 500,000 were &quot; stores.&quot; In the same period about 33,000 &quot; store &quot; cattle were imported from Canada and about 44,000 fat cattle to be killed at the ports. Canada&apos;s contribution, though increasing, is thus very small as compared with that of the Irish Free State, and even under the best conditions will only develop gradually in proportion to the increase and improvement in quality of the Canadian herds. The United Kingdom consumer desires fresh beef, and we feel that any steps towards increasing the imports of live cattle from the Empire will go some way towards reducing the home country&apos;s dependence on foreign sources of supply for its beef.13. Whatever ultimate expansion may take place in the importation of live cattle, we feel that under present conditions the main supplies of beef for the British market must continue to be carried in a refrigerated condition. In this regard South America has a well-established position, due to the fact that beef can be brought thence to the United Kingdom in good quality because chilled and not frozen. Thus South America has a decided advantage over the parts of the Empire -chiefly Australia and New Zealand which compete with her in the British market. Owing to the distance of Australia and New Zealand, it has not so far been commercially practicable to ship beef in other than a frozen condition. Furthermore, conditions in South America are exceptionally favourable for the production of cattle. The breed of cattle which predominates is the British Shorthorn, and very large sums of money have been expended in the purchase of pedigree bulls from the United Kingdom. The best steers are fat enough for slaughter when they are from two to three years old. A good steer will weigh 1,300 lb. and yield 750 lb. dressed carcass weight. Among producers in this part of the world, as elsewhere, breeding and fattening are two distinct businesses. The farmer who fattens buys his steers when they are about one and a half years old, and sells them a year or so later in prime condition. Thus the South American is in a position to maintain a continuous supply of uniformly graded carcasses, of the age, type and finish which best satisfy the requirements of the United Kingdom market.
63719200____Report of Econ. Com..... Pt. II____Gal. SIX    ____14. We find it difficult to arrive at any reliable estimate of the prospects of the cattle-producing industry in South America, because the information obtainable is somewhat meagre. Official estimates are published from time to time of the number of cattle in the Argentine and in Uruguay, but past experience shows that it is not advisable to place any great reliance on these figures. Several good authorities, however, hold that the Argentine Republic has practically reached the limit of its productive capacity under present conditions, especially in view of the rapid expansion which has taken place within recent years in the production of dairy produce and in the -area of land devoted to the growing of cereals. So far as Uruguay is concerned, there would seem to be still room for some increase in the annual output of beef. As regards Brazil, it is generally accepted that its capacity is very much greater than is indicated by its present output, but the quality of beef produced is very much lower than that of the beef produced in the Argentine, and up to the present it has not been suitable for the British market. On the whole, it would appear that if the Argentine Republic should be unable materially to increase its output of beef in the near future, any considerable increase in the European demand will have to be supplied from sources other than South American.15. As regards the supply of refrigerated beef from Empire countries, Australia and New Zealand are at present the only sources of any importance. Their total contribution is small, as the figures in Table V show, amounting in all to only about 82 per cent, of the total imports into the United Kingdom. Beef production in New Zealand is subsidiary to the dairy industry, the cattle there being mostly of the dairy type. On the 31st of January 1924 there were 1,312,600 dairy cows out of a total of 3,563,500 head of cattle. Moreover, owing to the great distance from the United Kingdom, it has not hitherto been found commercially practicable to export chilled beef from New Zealand, though the possibility of such shipments is now being explored. This is a decided handicap, as the product is at once placed in a price category below &quot; chilled &quot; and at a price level which is unremunerative to the producer. Under such conditions increased production is out of the question and attention has naturally been turned to a rapid development of the dairy industry which has proved more profitable. Australia, as regards distance from the United Kingdom market, is under the same handicap as New Zealand and is compelled to ship her product in the &quot; frozen&quot; state. In view of these considerations we cannot too strongly emphasize the importance of every effort being made to assist research with the object of improving the methods of carriage and of shortening the time of transit between these parts of the Empire and the United Kingdom market. We understand that land is available in Australia which would be suitable for feeding a further 7 to 10 million head of cattle. During the seven years 1914-5 to 1920-1 the annual production of beef in Australia averaged about 340,000 tons, of which 73 per cent, is estimated to have been consumed in the Common-wealth. During the past five years imports of beef into the United Kingdom from Australia have averaged only 49,000 tons, and the. supply has tended to decrease, the quantity in 1924 being 30,000 tons less than was imported in 1913. During the first six months of 1925, however, there has been an upward turn in the figures.For the past three years beef production in Australia is said to have been unremunerative. One witness asserted that during the first two of these three years the producer was receiving for his fat cattle no more than half the costs of production, while during the third year prices were just about sufficient to pay the costs. Even to-day&apos;s improved prices do not justify any expansion of the industry into the vast unoccupied territories of Australia, and we are informed that if there is no advance in prices beef production in Australia will tend to diminish rather than to increase. But if prices in the future should prove sufficiently attractive there is undoubtedly room for considerable development in the cattle-raising mdnsri^JD
______....:. ....   ______.. . .  _____-..............state would probably be as important as anything else in pro-viding the necessary stimulus to this trade.   Furthennore, itmust be pointed out that there is considerable room for improve-ment both in the breeding of the cattle in Australia and in regardto the age of slaughtering.   The last depends, of course, to acertain extent on the first, as improved breeding undoubtedlyhastens the age of maturity.   This is a matter which should betaken in hand immediately since it will require some time to change the character of the herds ; it is a necessary preliminary to enabling Australia to take full advantage of any methodwhich may be&quot; devised for bringing chilled beef from australia to the United Kingdom in commercial quantities.   There is alsoroom for great improvement in the grading and standardizationof Australian beef, and this, as we have already stated, is oneof the most important factors in the marketing of any importedproduct in Great Britain.16. The Union of South Africa and Rhodesia have within the last decade advanced considerably in meat production, and the cattle population is to-day far beyond the local requirements. In order to encourage export the Union Government in 1923 passed a Beef Bounties Act, which provided for the payment of \a. a lb. on all beef exported and \a. a lb. on the live weight of all cattle exported.Geographically these countries are more favourably placed for export purposes than some of the other Dominions, and important developments may confidently be expected whenever the cost of transportation can be reduced. While there has been a steady improvement in the herds a good deal must yet be done in the way of grading up in order to provide for a continuous supply of cattle and beef of the standard needed in the United Kingdom market. There was recently a trial shipment of slaughter cattle from Rhodesia and the animals realized good prices when sold.Nigeria, East Africa and possibly British Guiana are the only other sources of beef supply within the Empire which might become important, but they are still in a preliminary stage of stocking and the possibility of catering for the United Kingdom market has not yet been seriously considered.17. It has been seen that the time required for transporting beef from Australia and New Zealand to the British market is such as to necessitate under present conditions the freezing of the product. As a result, beef from these sources does not fetch as high a price as a competing product which, because of proximity to the market, may be landed in the much preferred chilled condition. We have already referred to the importance of continued research. We think that with proper and adequate assistance for research, ways of overcoming the handicap under which Australia and New Zealand suffer may be found. The problem may be approached from several different angles. For example : (1) The freezing process may be improved to such an extent that the quality and appearance of the meat may not be impaired; (2) the method of chilling may be developed so that meat may be held for a longer time in a chilled condition than is possible at present; (3) the time occupied in transit between these outlying Dominions and Great Britain may be so reduced that even the present methods of cmlling may become available.
-.. 19200 Report of Economic Com., Pt. II-Gal. 7 . .-18.. In addition to the advantage which foreign beef enjoys owing to its being marketed in a chilled state, it has been shown to our satisfaction that, in consequence of the repute which that beef has acquired on the British market, it has been worth the while of the producer to give much attention to the improvement of the quality of the meat itself. This has been achieved through careful breeding. Even were it commercially practicable to place Australian and New Zealand chilled beef on the United Kingdom market, the foreign product would still hold its own because of the present inherent superiority which it has acquired. The lead which has thus been obtained by the foreigner can be reduced with time and persistence, and it is with this object that we shall outline in our recommendations a policy for the improvement of the breeds within the Empire.19. In considering the marketing of Empire products as compared with foreign, we have noted certain differences in practice. The meat-packing industry in Argentina is in the hands of a few big companies, who attend to their own wholesale distri-bution on arrival in the United Kingdom. Under this system the plants are operated continuously throughout the year and the maximum efficiency in dressing, grading and packing is achieved. This is not the case in the Australian and New Zealand trade. In both these countries there are so many factories that it is difficult to attain the efficiency characteristic of South America. There is the further serious disadvantage that such a lack of concentration involves the loading of vessels at many ports, and that in consequence an increase of the costs of transportation occurs.20. The question of cold storage charges, which has been raised from time to time, is undoubtedly a matter requiring careful consideration.   We mention this here because it appears that the charge is, proportionately to the price, much higher in the case of beef than of mutton.   There is no doubt that on the basis of the present demand cold storage facilities are largely in excess of requirements in the United Kingdom.   This excess is due chiefly to the large expansion which was effected during the war, and also to the fact that chilled beef, which must be consumed immediately, is replacing frozen beef, which used to be kept for some weeks in cold storage.    The charges vary considerabty in different parts of the country, and although it has been demonstrated that the rates are bareh&apos; profitable to the owners of the cold stores, when account is taken of the operating expenses and the capital invested, yet they constitute a very considerable element in the cost of the article when finally offered for sale. Undoubtedly, a more extensive and continuous use of the cold storage capacity available might bring about a lowering of these rates by reducing the burden of overhead charges.    Such a development seems, however, unlikely, for the constant endeavour is to supply the consumer regularly with freshly arrived meat. None the less, it should be pointed out that by organization it would be possible to. contract for stated requirements over given periods, and thus to obtain more favourable rates than occasional users with irregular supplies.21. On a survey of the whole beef position we think it may be stated broadly that the Empire supplies, in that they are derived largely from the more distant Dominions, suffer from the handicap that they reach the London market in a frozen instead of a chilled condition. As a result of this they obtain prices which are unremunerative to the producer, who is therefore not stimu-lated either to improve or increase his herds. The key to the whole position lies in Research with a view to better methods of preservation during transport. Once that could be attained we feel that everything else would follow and that a great change might be effected in the relative position of the Empire and foreign countries in the United Kingdom market.

South American supplies have been increasing during this period, whereas imports from Australia and New Zealand have shown a tendency to decline. This is due mainly to the fact that the price of wool has been sufficiently high to cause farmers in Australia and New Zealand to increase their flocks at the expense of meat exports. The Irish Free State does not appear in the foregoing table (VI) of percentages because she sends to the British market mainly livestock and not dead meat. In 1924, 580,000 sheep and lambs were imported alive from the Irish Free State.4.   MUTTON AND LAMB. -        Qj.y g22. In the case of mutton and lamb the Empire is more nearly   . 040self-sufficient than in that of any other class of meat. The main supplies of imported mutton and lamb for the United Kingdom come from New Zealand and Australia. &quot;It will be seen from Table V that in 1924, out of a total of  20,088,000 paid by the United Kingdom for this class of imported meat, New Zealand received  10,157,000. The share of Australia was only  1,971,000, while foreign countries received  7,913,000, the sum of  604,000 being spent on fresh mutton and lamb from the Netherlands. New Zealand has furnished an annual average supply of 145,700 tons during the past five years, as compared with a pre-war annual average of 107,900 tons during the period 1910-4. Australia and Argentina average 52,800 and 67,900 tons respec-tively before the war as compared with 67,500 and 69,100 tons respectively for the past five years. Expressed as percentages of the total mutton and lamb imports into the United Kingdom the average annual supplies from the main sources are as follows : 
. 1 See paragraphs 301-8 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Food Prices (Cmd. 2390).26. Although Australia is the largest sheep-raising country in the world, the quantities of mutton and lamb exported are less than those from New Zealand. This is due to the fact that Australia has specialized on sheep-raising for wool production rather than for meat. The number of sheep has fluctuated widely, and the following figures are of interest : 1891106,421,000 head (the record number).190219111919192019211922-192353,668,000 head. 93,004,000 head. 75,554,000 head. 77,898,000 head. 82,226,000 head. 78,803,000 head. 80,110,000 head.23. As in the case of beef, the British market has a definite preference for mutton and lamb of certain specifications as regards size and quality. The growing preference of the con-sumer for smaller joints and cuts makes size and weight of carcass of prime importance. Well finished carcasses of light weight fetch the highest price per lb. In the case of mutton the most desirable weights range from 50 to 60 lb., while in lamb the 28 to 34 lb. carcasses are in the greatest demand. The most de-undesirable carcasses are the &quot; blocky &quot; compact ones with a minimum of waste and a uniform and comparatively high degree of finish throughout. Uniform grading as to weight, type and condition is essential to meet the requirements of the trade. Regularity and continuity of supply are more easily achieved in this class of meat than in any other as the imported supplies come forward for the most part in a &quot; frozen &quot; condition. The process of freezing does not impair the quality of lamb or mutton as it does the quality of beef, so that the seasonal kill can be frozen immediately and then evenly distributed ex store throughout the year.24. New Zealand produces the finest qualities of lamb, and undoubtedly satisfies all the requirements of the British market from this standpoint. The breed and type of sheep play a most important part in this success ; the supremacy of the smaller Down breeds for mutton and lamb production is recognized. In this respect New Zealand is well equipped, as her flocks are almost entirely of the cross-bred type. This is an important factor in making possible an almost standardized product for export. Moreover, the grading of New Zealand carcasses as to type, weight and finish furnishes an outstanding example in the matter of uniformity.25. A feature of the New Zealand meat trade is the regularity and continuity of supply. This has been rendered possible by the organization of the producers under the New Zealand Meat Producers&apos; Board. The main function of this Board, as it at present operates, is to regulate supplies from New Zealand to British ports in such a way as to prevent temporary gluts and -shortages, and this object it achieves by negotiating with the -shipping interests in respect of freight rates and the allotment of space. The Board has been the subject of criticism, but in view of the favourable finding of the recent Royal Commission on Food Prices,1 we have not felt it incumbent upon us to go into the matter further in this Report.
Exports of mutton and lamb fell off considerably during the war when beef had the first call on shipping space, and the shipment of accumulated stocks after the armistice disorganized the markets. The reduced flocks of 1919 were reflected in reduced consignments in 1920-1, but there was a substantial expansion in the next two years, especially in 1922-3, when prices in the United Kingdom were high. In 1924 about 9 per cent, of the United kingdom&apos;s imports of mutton and lamb came from Australia, as against 31-6 per cent, in 1913. The decline is to be attributed in part to the competition of New Zealand and Argentine supplies, and in part to climatic conditions. This latter factor, it may be hoped, is of diminishing importance, as with the development of railway facilities enabling stock to be transferred from one part of the country to another when necessity arises, and as a result of improvements such as fodder conservation, and the provision of reserves of water by means of bores and dams, the losses through drought are being noticeably reduced. In so far as the Australian grazier&apos;s main pre-occupation is the production of high-grade merino sheep for wool, the subsidiary nature of the meat business makes it very difficult to achieve the output and regularity which characterize the New Zealand trade. Regularity and continuity of supply are most important factors in the attainment of success in the British market, and we cannot too strongly impress on the producer the advantage he will derive from close attention to these points. The raising of sheep for mutton is an industry just as specialized as the raising of sheep for wool.27. The foreign mutton and lamb imported into the United Kingdom comes chiefly from South America. The competition from this source is steadily growing, and the supply has increased in the last ten years. Furthermore, the quality has improved, especially during the last few seasons. These supplies come chiefly from Argentina and Patagonia. The Patagonian meat arrives from April to July, and constitutes a quarter of the total foreign importation. The Argentine mutton and lamb comes regularly throughout the year, comprising the remaining three-quarters.28. The prospects of any material increase in the supplies of imported mutton and lamb in the future are dependent upon the possibilities of greater supplies from Australia and Africa. It is very doubtful whether New Zealand is in a position greatly to increase her trade. The possibilities of greater supplies from Australia must depend upon the relative profits of meat production and wool production. There are indications that certain areas in Australia are being utilized in greater degree for dual purpose cross-bred sheep. If this proves remunerative, Australia will without doubt provide more of the class of mutton and lamb required in the United Kingdom market. Every effort should therefore be made to achieve uniformity of carcasses, so that purchasers may be as ready to buy parcels of Australian lamb and mutton, merely on grade, as they are now ready to buy the New Zealand product. In the case of New Zealand they have the certainty that each carcass in the parcel will vary only slightly from the average of the grade weight.

Another large sheep-producing area in the Empire is to be found in the Union of South Africa. The Union ranks fourth or fifth among the countries of the world in sheep population, being exceeded only by Australia, Russia, the United States, and possibly the Argentine. Sheep-breeding is One of the oldest and most important industries in South Africa but wool production has been the principal aim. It is generally accepted that the greater part of South Africa is much more suited to the merino than to the majority of English or cross-breeds, and this is no doubt the reason why the production of merino has been fostered. The merino breed has been greatly improved by importations from various sources, during earlier years from Holland and the United Kingdom and during recent years from Australia. The result is that to-day the wool industry of the Union may be considered as being based upon a careful selection of rams for the breeding of pure merinoes. Hitherto South Africa has not exported mutton and lamb. Prior to the war it was found necessary rather to import large quantities for consumption. During the war imports into South Africa dwindled to negligible dimensions, and although the imports in 1920 almost reached the pre-war level the upward movement has not subsequently been maintained. Good class mutton sheep can be raised success-fully; but as in the case of Australia, the development of a trade in mutton and lamb must depend on the relative profits of meat and wool production. There are from five to six million indigenous non-woolled sheep which yield excellent mutton and lamb when crossed with the Down breeds.5. PIG PRODUCTS.Pork, Bacon and Hams. .30. Bacon is one of the staple articles in the diet of the British people, and a review of the sources of importation of this and other pig meats will make very evident the dependence of the United Kingdom upon foreign supplies. In 1924 the United Kingdom imported 9,502,000 cwt. of bacon and hams as com-pared with an import of 5,713,000 cwt. in 1913, but the statistics are not comparable, since the latter figure does not include imports from the Irish Free State. These amounted in 1924 to 595,000 cwt.Table V shows how large a part bacon plays in the national meat bill and the extent to which it is obtained from non-Empire sources. Out of  105,447,000 spent in 1924 on imported meats of all classes, no less than  50,848,000, or 48 per cent., went to purchase pig products, and of this sum  40,120,000 went to foreign countries. The bulk of the expenditure was for bacon and hams, although there was an appreciable import of fresh pork, amounting in 1924 to 279,000 cwt., from the Irish Free State and 534,000. cwt. from the Continent.31. Omitting imports from the Irish Free State, for which complete figures are not available, the percentages shown in the following table express the trend of development from the chief external sources of supply, and the proportion borne by the imports from each source to the aggregate imports.Table VII.

In the bacon market of the United Kingdom a very high standard of quality is generally asked for. The demand is principally for bacon in the form of whole Wiltshire sides. These must satisfy certain requirements as to weight, conformation and thickness of fat, and must, in addition, be mildly cured. Although there is a market for a wide range in weights and qualities, nevertheless the great bulk of the demand is for sides weighing from 55 to 70 lb. ; a 60-lb. side, which is the product of a pig of 2001b. live weight, being most in favour. Further, the majority of the consuming public prefer bacon that is not too fat ; so that sides carrying 1  in. to If in. of fat evenly distributed along the back are most in demand. This requirement forms the basis upon which Wiltshire sides are graded, and although the grades may differ in name according to the country from which the product originates, nevertheless, they are all established on the same basis and are well understood by the trade. Furthermore, as the retailer of bacon in the United Kingdom buys the whole side, which he then cuts up and distributes to his customers, he is very desirous ot securing Wiltshires with a long middle and a thick streak, thus obtaining the maximum weight in the most valuable part of the carcass. To ensure the fulfilment of these requirements as to weight, finish and shape or conformation, a pig of certain definite proportions and finish, known as a &quot; bacon pig,&quot; is needed.33. In reviewing the sources of supply, we have been impressed with the steadily increasing quantities obtained from Denmark. In 1914 the United Kingdom imported 2,715,000 cwt. from this source, which up to that time had been the largest Danish contribution known. After 1914, supplies steadily declined until in 1918-9 practically nothing reached the United Kingdom from Denmark, as during the war period Danish supplies were diverted to other markets. Shipments were resumed in 1920, when the United Kingdom received 704,000 cwt. of bacon from Denmark. Danish supplies have increased annually since then, until in 1924 they reached 3,978,000 cwt., which was nearly 50 per cent, more than the previous record of 1914. The by-products of the Danish dairy industry with other home-grown feeding-stuffs, supplemented by imports of small grains, furnish a satisfactory ration for bacon-pig production. Furthermore, through the highly developed Danish system of agricultural and co-operative organization, a uniformly high standard of product is maintained. Proximity to market is also a decided advantage, as the bacon can be midly cured and distributed regularly to consumers in the United Kingdom in a fresh condition. It should also be noted that since Denmark is a very small country bacon production is there a specialized industry concentrated in a comparatively limited area, and that in consequence the details of production, manufacture, and selling can be, and are, well organized.
-.. 19200 Report of Economic Com., Pt. II-Gal.10..-34. The United States is now the second largest source of supply to the United Kingdom market, although prior to 1924 imports from this quarter exceeded those from any other. During the war years, when Danish supplies practically disappeared from the United Kingdom, the United States furnished large quantities, reaching the peak in 1918 with shipments totalling 10,064,000 cwt. Imports have since declined, and in 1924 amounted to only 3,310,000 cwt., a figure which, none the less, is still in excess of the, average pre-war shipments from the United States. The class of product received from this source differs somewhat from that received from Denmark, in that, while the latter country is chiefly concerned in the trade in whole Wiltshire sides, the cheaper class of product, such as Cumberland out, picnic hams, hams and cut meats, is obtained from the United States. The supplies sent across the Atlantic constitute only a very small percentage of the total United States production, and from the American point of view their chief importance lies in the fact that by the variation of their amount they can be used to steady prices in the large home market.35. Bacon is also imported from other foreign countries, principally from Sweden and the Netherlands, but the quantity is comparatively small. The product from these countries is very similar in character and quality to the Danish, and although the supply as a whole is more irregular, it constitutes in both cases a contribution to the higher-priced market.36. The imports of this class of meat from the Empire come mainly from the Irish Free State and Canada. Figures are not available to show the amount derived prior to April 1923 from the territory now forming the Irish Free State, but it is well recognized that these supplies cater for a high-priced demand of a special cure and flavour very popular with the British consumer. In 1924 the supplies from this source were 595,000 cwt., being 6J per cent, of the total imports. During the first six months of 1925 they decreased 26 per cent, as compared with those of the same period in 1924. This drop is attributed to the fact that during the second half of 1924 Irish farmers generally did not regard pig keeping as remunerative, and the view was then current that there was a probability of a world surplus&quot; of bacon. Consequently the general tendency, as in other countries, was towards a reduction in breeding stocks, with the result that Irish farmers are not now in a position to take full advantage of the improved prices prevailing in 1925. In the opinion of our witnesses there would appear to be some lack of uniformity in the weight and finish of Irish pigs which makes it difficult to turn out a uniformly graded product, and it would be advan-tageous if the farmer could somehow be paid for his pigs on the basis of grade. This would tend to encourage a wider use of the pure-bred boars now available as a result of various schemes for I the improvement of livestock.37. In view of the huge annual expenditure of the United Kingdom on foreign bacon and also of the undoubted popularity of Irish bacon with the consumer, we would emphasize the importance of efforts to make pig raising in Ireland more profit-able. Action with a view to improving the quality of the animals and at the same time of introducing more economical methods of feeding is most necessary. A further matter to which our attention has been called is the need of some investigation of the high transport charges between Ireland and Great Britain as compared with those between Denmark and Great Britain. It has been ascertained that the cost of importing bacon from Tralee to Manchester is 72s. 4d. a ton, while the cost from Denmark to Manchester via Esbjerg and Grimsby is 57s. Qd. a ton, the figures in each case being for large consignments. A substantial temporary concession has, we understand, recently been made by some of the shipping lines from Ireland.38. Canada&apos;s chief contribution to the meat supply of the United Kingdom is of bacon and hams, but the volume of trade is still far below that of Denmark, although it has lately increased both absolutely and relatively. This is made evident by a comparison of the percentage changes as shown in Table VII.
n extension of that table it may be stated that in the first six months of 1925 the total British imports of bacon and hams were 3-5 per cent, less than in the first six months of 1924, but the imports from the Irish Free State decreased by 26 per cent., while those from Canada were 26 per cent, higher. The imports from the United States decreased by 16 per cent, and those from Denmark by 2 per Cent.39. We may also usefully compare the landed values of the goods obtained from Canada with those of the goods from other sources of supply. The following table gives the figures for bacon, but not for hams, during recent years.Table VIII.Comparison of Landed  Values of Bacon from chief sources ofsupply.Bacon from	Average 1909-13.	1922.	1923.	1924.	1925 (half-year) .Irish Free State Denmark Canada United States	Per cwt.  3-42  3-11  3-01	Per cwt.  7-05  5-86  4-95	Per cwt. ^5-39*  5-56  4-61  4-07	Per cwt.  5-30  5-10  4-65  3-91	Per cwt. ^6-09  5-61 ^4-94  4-62* Based on imports from April to December.It must be borne in mind, however, that these figures which have been calculated from the customs returns of the United Kingdom, are based upon values given by importers and must not be taken as necessarily indicating market prices. The values returned by the importers may be based on long-standing con-tracts or out-of-date market conditions. They suffice, however, to indicate that, in general, as shown in paragraph 36, Irish bacon commands a higher price than other imported bacons. The figure for the year 1923 is an exception, and is accounted for by the strike during the summer months, which kept supplies off the market during the period of high prices, and thus affected the annual average. As regards Canadian bacon, the figures indicate that the difference in the prices of Canadian and American bacon is now much greater than before the war. As between Canadian and Danish bacon, it is to be noted that in 1909-13 the Canadian product was lower in price than the Danish by 9-1 per cent, and in 1924 by 9-9 per cent. This, however, does not fully bring out the trend of competition and development as between these two sources of supply, for a more detailed study of average values reveals the fact that in 1921 Danish bacon realized 35s. 8d. per cwt. more than Canadian ; in 1922, 23s. 8d. per cwt. more ; in 1923, 19s. Od. per cwt. more ; and in 1924 only 9s. lid. per cwt. more. In the first half of 1925 there was a slight change in tendency, but not enough as yet seriously to modify the general trend.
19200____Report of Econ. Com40. It is evident from the above figures that some powerful factor must have existed in the past to cause such a discrepancy in value, and that this must have been removed or reduced to account for the gradual narrowing in price differential as between Canadian and Danish bacon. It has already been pointed out that during the war the shipment of bacon from Denmark to the United Kingdom almost stopped. During that period supplies came from Canada and the United States. It was during the war period and immediately afterwards that the Canadian supplies were heaviest, reaching their peak of 2,169,000 cwt. in 1919. During the war, and particularly during the last two years of post-war control (1919 and 1920), the Canadian trade suffered under heavy disabilities. There was a tremendous accumulation, of American and Canadian bacon which was allowed to become stale and acquired a bad reputation ; the effect of this lasted much longer than was anticipated, and is still being felt. When the fresh Danish product began to appear again in 1920 it naturally met with the favour of the consuming public.41. The recent improvement in the situation is due to an organized effort on the part of the producers, the packers, and the Government in Canada. This has resulted in the improvement of the pigs themselves, a greater uniformity of the product, a milder cure, and a quicker distribution so that the bacon reaches the consumer in the United Kingdom in a fresher condition. The Canadian product is shipped for the most part in the form of whole Wiltshire sides, and now competes more directly with the product from Denmark than with that from the United States. By virtue of her proximity, Denmark can market bacon in the United Kingdom within two weeks of slaughtering, while from Eastern Canada it takes four weeks and from Western Canada five or six weeks to reach the market. In view of the very decided preference of the British consumer for a fresh mild-cured bacon, this is a heavy handicap, as the Canadian product must neces-sarily be cured so as to carry for a longer time. It would appear, therefore, that only a more rapid transit or a more satisfactory method of long-period cure would put Canada on a par with Denmark.   Research should be directed to the latter end.42. The question of transport divides itself into the two questions of more rapid transport and a more regular shipping service. What is required is that vessels from Canada should bring bacon to the most suitable ports on the same day each week. This would go far to place Canadian and Danish supplies on a more equal footing in the United Kingdom market. We are not in a position to judge as to the practicability of such an improved shipping service, but we would venture to suggest, as a first step, that the shippers of bacon in Canada should get together and ascertain precisely what is desirable. This could then be presented to the Shipping Conference. Failing a satis-factory negotiation, the matter could then be carried to the Imperial Shipping Committee with a view to enlisting the influence of that body.43. There remains the other method of overcoming the present handicap of time and distance under which, not only the Canadian, but also other Dominion, producers suffer. This is the discovery of some new or improved way of curing which will enhance the keeping qualities of the bacon and still maintain the mildness of flavour so much desired by the British consumer. This would open up possibilities for the bacon trade in the distant parts of the Empire such as Australia and New Zealand. Scientific research, possibly on a large scale, will be necessary, and, although private firms are continually endeavouring to effect improvements in cure, their efforts are limited. With a problem of this nature, a solution of which would be of the utmost value to Empire trade, we think that provision for research should be made outside the industry itself.  This we deal with in a later section of this Report,44. South Africa forms another possible source of future supply. As recently as 1914 practically the whole of the bacon consumed there was imported.    At the present time home
.equiremcjii.3 ai&apos;e&quot;Deing met &quot;and there is a smalT export. Con-siderable attention has been paid to breeding, and a number of bacon factories have been established on up-to-date lines which are manufacturing prime bacon and hams.45. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the chief supplies of imported bacon and hams. Most of the fresh pork required in the United Kingdom, and some of the bacon, is produced at home. It is estimated that about 34 per cent, of the total re* quirements of pig products are of home production. On the other hand, considerable quantities of fresh pork are imported, chiefly from the Irish Free State and the Continent. Any re-placement of the fresh-killed foreign product must obviously come either from Home or from the Irish Free State. Such a development must depend on the profits to be earned in pork production. New Zealand, Australia and certain parts of Africa ship frozen pork for curing in the United Kingdom. Bacon is being shipped from New Zealand and Australia, but owing to their geographical position and the present-day practice of bacon curing, their products are placed under a great disadvantage. Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa are all capable of developing a large export trade in pig products provided that research can solve the transportation problem involved.6.   CANNED MEAT AND FISH.46. Canned meat is sold largely by brand, and a constant and adequate supply is necessary if the brand is to maintain its position with the consumer. Regularity of supply has been achieved by the South American and United States canning factories, and their brands completely dominate the United Kingdom market. Although certain Australian and New Zealand packing companies supply canned meats of high quality, their supplies are irregular and uncertain, and they cannot hope to compete in the open market in the United Kingdom unless they are prepared to send forward their product with regularity throughout the year.47. For the reasons we have already given, we deal here with canned fish as well as canned meat. In Table IX are shown the quantities of canned fish imported into the United Kingdom from Empire and foreign sources respectively during recent years : Table IX.Kind of Fish.	IMPORTS.

Japanese-packed Siberian red salmon has been imported into the United Kingdom in increasing quantities during the last ten years. This growth coincides with the decline in the importation of the British Columbia salmon. Up to the time when Siberian salmon appeared in the United Kingdom market in considerable quantity, the British dealers reserved their best distinctive selling brands for British Columbia sockeye, which made from 10 to 15 shillings a case more than the Siberian product. When, however, importations from Siberia exceeded those from British Columbia, the dealers began to include Siberian salmon under their best brands, no longer Confining them to sockeyc from British Columbia. The result was that the producers in British Columbia found an outlet for the bulk of their pack elsewhere, and sent only their surplus to the United Kingdom market.&apos;50. The salmon packers of the United States have a protected domestic market for approximately 75 per cent, of their large pack, and they export merely the surplus over home requirements. The packers of British Columbia, on the other hand, have a domestic market for not more than 27 per cent, and must export no less than 73 per cent, of their pack. But the 25 per cent, of the United States pack is as large as the 73 per cent, of the British Columbia pack. Provided that the United States packer is obtaining a good price in his home market, he can, occasionally at any rate, afford to accept, for the advantage of a quick clearance, prices in foreign markets which would not be remunerative-ative had he to dispose of the whole or of a large portion of his supplies at those prices  This is a serious handicap for BritishSo far as the Empire is concerned salmon is the chief item and this comes mainly from Canada. Foreign salmon is imported from Russia, Japan and the United States. Canned lobsters come almost entirely from Canada, but there is a small import from Newfoundland. There are no important foreign sources of canned lobster. Canned crayfish are imported from the Cape of Good Hope to the extent of about 30,000 cwt. per annum, but most of it is re-exported to France.48. In Table X the quantities of Canadian canned salmon imported into the United Kingdom are compared with the quantities imported from other sources. It will be seen that there has been a great increase of consumption in the United Kingdom, the total quantity imported and retained in 1924, being twice as much as the average quantity imported and retained annually in 1909-13. Out of the increase of 424,000 cwt. in gross imports, 311,700 cwt. came from Russia and Japan and 122,800 cwt. from the United States, while the Canadian supplies in 1924 were actually less than the pre-war average imports by 10,000 cwt., although in that year there was a large and welcome increase as compared with the four preceding years.Table X.
51. Our attention has been drawn to the fact that the canning of salmon and other fish and shell-fish in Canada is controlled by the Department of Marine and Fisheries under the authority of a Meat and Canned Foods Act. The Act provides that all cans of fish must be marked with a true description of the contents, including the vernacular name, together with the name of the place where the packing was done. All the conditions laid down in the Act as to labelling and marking must be complied with in the case of cans sold in Canada. In view of the fact, however, that the importers of canned fish in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, insist on the cans being shipped without labels in order that they may use their own labels and marks, it was laid down in the Act, at the request of the industry, that the Governor-General in Council may give authority to exempt from the labelling clause of the Act canned fish for exportation. It has been represented to us in evidence that if the law of the United Kingdom required the country of origin to be shown on all such imported canned goods, the special power of granting exemption under the Canadian Act would be unnecessary and the position of the British Columbia producer would be very materially assisted in the United Kingdom market. It would, moreover, enable the British consumer to select canned goods from the Empire in preference to foreign canned goods.7. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.52. We have now passed in review the present position of the meat supply of the United Kingdom, and we have tried to make evident the changes which appear to be in progfess. In making -our recommendations we shall endeavour to keep in mind the interests of the home producer, and also, as our terms of reference direct, the importance of safeguarding the position of the consumer.53. The Linlithgow Report on &quot; Distribution and Prices of Agricultural Produce &quot; recognized the importance of identification as between home-produced and imported meat, and stated that if means could be devised to mark effectively either the imported or the home-produced article, or both, it would be advantageous to the public as a whole. Under the Sale of Food Order, 1921, it is forbidden to expose for retail sale imported meat unless such meat bears a label containing either the word &quot; Imported &quot; or words disclosing the country of origin clearly printed. The only exception allowed is where a notice is exhibited in a con-spicuous position in the shop indicating that only imported meat is on sale. In some parts of the country, as the Royal Commission on Food Prices pointed out, the provisions of the Order are seriously enforced, while in others it does not appear to be an effective instrument. The latter is more particularly the case in the larger consuming centres which depend necessarily to a great extent on imported supplies. The Order does not provide for any distinction as between &quot; Empire&quot; Imported and &quot; Foreign &quot; Imported Supplies. For the reasons which we have given in our first Report, we are unanimous in. the view that this distinction should henceforth be required.
19200-Report of Economic Report Part II-Gal 13.54. There is no effective and practical means for marking the meat itself when sold in small portions to the consumer. Whole carcasses, however, can be marked and the retailer or other person who cuts them up can identify their source, and we would place on him the responsibility of passing on this identification to the consumer. Our proposals in regard to labelling have been stated in our First Report.55. With the exception of the Irish Free State, the Dominions of the Empire, notwithstanding their vast potentialities for the production of meat, are handicapped as compared with their foreign competitors by their distance from the United Kingdom market. The outstanding examples are Australia and New Zealand as compared with Argentina in the matter of beef supply, and Canada as compared with Denmark in the matter of bacon. Any programme for future Empire development which failed to recognize the importance of this handicap would only lead to disappointment. Quicker transportation would no doubt help to solve the problem, but speed is expensive and therefore tends to increase costs. But if sufficiently rapid transportation could be arranged to place Australian and New Zealand meat on the United Kingdom market in a chilled, instead of frozen condition, the higher price obtained for the product would suffice to cover these costs up to a point. Such an increase in the supply of chilled meat would be of advantage to the consumer in the United Kingdom, and obviously also to the producers in the Dominions. We therefore recommend that the Governments concerned should encourage their producers in conjunction with the shipping companies, to make a fresh study of this problem from this point of view.56. Ample evidence has been submitted to us that in many cases the foreign product enjoys a preference because it better satisfies the requirements of the market. In some instances this is due to the greater attention which has been devoted to breeding operations in order to obtain a uniform early-maturing animal. We feel that the policy of live stock improvement is one which deserves and needs encouragement in all the Dominions, and in order to give some practical direction to such a policy we have recommended in our First Report that a portion of the proposed annual grant from the British Government should be used to defray the cost of transporting pedigree breeding cattle, sheep and swine from the United Kingdom to other parts of the Empire. In view of the time needed to obtain results from a breeding policy we think that this scheme should be inaugurated without delay: To achieve substantial results it should be continued for a period of at least five years.57. In the United Kingdom there is undoubtedly a desire on the part of the consumer for fresh killed meat in preference to all:other descriptions of meat.  The obvious method of meeting this demand is through an extension of feeding operations by the farmers of the United Kingdom.   This implies increased breeding, or the, increased importation of store animals, or both.   We have-not received any evidence on this subject on the side of British producers and we are, of course, aware that the matter has, in recent years, been the subject of considerable controversy in the United Kingdom.    We feel, however, that apart  from  the restrictions imposed to prevent the introduction of disease, it is undesirable from the point of view of the interests of the United Kingdom consumer and of the producer in the Overseas parts of the Empire to place restrictions on the entrance of store cattle and we further feel that it is especially undesirable to differentiate in restrictive legislation between one Dominion and another as at present.    We therefore recommend that  the existing legislation in reference to the importation of live cattle into the United Kingdom be reconsidered.
58. The question of cold storage charges is one of concern to many users. In this connexion we would draw attention to paragraph 262 of the Report of the Royal Commission on Food Prices, which states that rates in general are not remunerative to the owners. At the same time it must be realized that the existing charges constitute a large item in marketing costs and in relation to the value of the products stored. We suggest therefore to the, users of cold storage that they should try to negotiate for more favourable terms by contracting for a given space over a given time. It is inevitable that those who make use of cold storage irregularly and for comparatively small quantities will have to pay less favourable rates.59. Throughout this Report we have had to point out the advantage which a standardized uniform product enjoys in the United Kingdom market. There is, no doubt, a difficulty in grading and standardizing meat unless livestock of good quality is forthcoming in large number. We trust that the Govern-ments of the Empire will continue to urge their producers carefully to study the requirements of the United Kingdom market and maintain and develop their present efforts to conform to the British consumers&apos; needs.60. We have found it convenient to review in this Report trade in canned meat and fish, but we have already in our First Report made our recommendation as to the embossing of the -cans in regard to marks of origin. &apos;61. We have expressed our thanks to our Secretary, Mr. Herbert Broadley, in our First Report, presented simultaneously with this Report. We desire here to add our thanks to Mr. W.
