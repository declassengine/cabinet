Copy No -        3 0CP. 342 (25).CABINET.NAVAL PROGRAMME COMMITTEE.REPORT.1. AT a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 18th February, 1925 (Cabinet 9 (25), Conclusion 2), the Cabinet agreed that a Committee should be appointed to con-sider the programme of construction for the replacement of cruisers and other warships, including the building of aircraft carrriers and the development of the Fleet Air Arm during the next few years, as well as the manning of the Fleet and oil fuel reserves, and that a Supplementary Estimate should, if necessary, be intro-duced later in the Session to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations on any of these questions.   The Committee was subsequently constituted as follows : -The Secretary of State for India (Chairman).The Lord Privy Seal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The First Commissioner of Works.Owing to pressure of other urgent public business the Minister of Health found it impossible to take any part in our proceedings, and his resignation of membership was accepted by the Prime Minister.2. It became evident at an early stage in our Enquiry that the problem before us wras twofold in its character. First of all there is the undoubted need of systematically replacing the units of the Fleet as they became unserviceable through age; and, secondly, the degree of urgency which should govern the process. It was also clear from the beginning that the Naval Power against which the Admiralty were measuring themselves was Japan. We therefore sought the guidance of the Committee of Imperial Defence upon the question of the probability of a war with Japan in any future period with which we need now concern ourselves. The conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence upon this subject were subsequently ratified by the Cabinet (Cabinet 24 (25), Conclusion 3), and are as follows :-&quot; (a.) On the understanding that the present decision did not in any way reverse the general policy of the Government to provide a base at Singapore to accommodate the main fleet (the programme for which is under consideration by a special Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence), and-that the decision of the Cabinet of the 2nd March, 1925, in regard to the programme for the next few years was also unaffected, to approve the following recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence : &quot; (i.) The Committee of Imperial Defence recommend that.the policy of leaving to the Admiralty, subject to the paramount authority of the Cabinet,, the responsibility for the naval defence of the Empire on the basis of the one-Power standard, should not be reversed or modified. Even before the War it was recognised that the two-Power standard did not necessarily imply that our fleets were able simultaneously to- deal with the concentrated fleets of two first-class naval Powers in different quarters of the globe, as well as to provide for all other naval requirements. This is equally true of the one-Power standard to-day. The requirements of a one-Power standard are satisfied if our fleet, [13331&quot;] J3
wherever situated, is equal to the fleet of any other nation, wherever situated provided that arrangements are made from time to time in different parts of the world, according as the international situation requires, to enable the local forces to maintain the situation against vital and irreparable damage pending the arrival of the main fleet, and to give the main fleet, on arrival, sufficient mobility.&quot; (ii.) The Committee accept the view of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that, in existing circumstances, aggressive action against the British Empire on the part of Japan within the next ten years is not a contingency seriously to be apprehended.&quot; The Foreign Office should be responsible for warning the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence of any change in the international situation in the Far East which would necessitate a fresh review of the question.&quot; (iii.) Although, in accordance with recent decisions, preliminary arrangements to establish docking facilities for our largest ships at Singapore and to develop gradually the necessary oil fuel installations on our Eastern routes should proceed, there is no necessity, in view of Conclusion (ii), to make preparations involving additional expenditure for placing at Singapore, for a decisive battle in the Pacific, a British battle-fleet, with cruisers, flotillas and all ancillary vessels, superior in strength, or at least equal, to the sea-going navy of Japan. This decision should be reviewed automatically by the Committee of Imperial Defence every year, in the light of the international situation.&quot; Further, in order that all the data required for a decision may be readih available in the event of a change in the situation in the Far East, the Com-mittee of Imperial Defence and the Singapore Sub-Committee should enquire and report as to the preparations which would have to be made if it became necessary to reverse the above decision.&quot; To meet the unlikely contingency of war occurring before the base at Singapore is capable of sustaining a British fleet superior to the Japanese Navy, the Admiralty should consider in advance what facilities can be made available from Great Britain or elsewhere to supplement the facilities which already exist in the Far East.&quot;&apos; We have been guided by these conclusions in all the subsequent stages of oar Enquiry.3. It is natural that in our prolonged discussions the Treasury and the Admiralty should have represented their respective points of view; and we are glad to report that, although no agreement has been reached, the original differences between these Departments have been very sensToly reduced by concessions on both sides. The Admiralty have reduced their programme of future construction in various important ways. They have adopted a longer period of life for existing British cruisers, destroyers and submarines. They have eliminated various ancillary vessels. They have effected diminutions on their original proposals, which over the six years in question (1925/26-1930/31) aggregate upwards of  51&quot; millions. We wish to recognise the great efforts which the First Lord and the First Sea Lord have made to bring their &quot;requirements within reasonable financial limits. The final six-year programme proposed by the Admiralty is as follows : Type.

Cost of New Construction.-	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.	1930-31.Old Programme New Programme      .. Totals	  7,647,877 1,280,950	  6,953,950 6,626,850	  2,197.634 11,558,736	  68,055 12,949,431	  13,160,280	  13,298,611	8,928,827	13,580,800	13,756,370	13,017,486	13,160,280	13,298,6114. On this basis the Naval Estimates, which at present stand at  60J millions plus  2 millions shadow-cut, would next year, and in succeeding years, range between  68 and  69 millions.The Treasury view is that such a total next year and the year after will impose an undue strain on our finances. They contend that a rise of over  6 millions on the present figure, which represents an increase of  3-^ millions on 1924-25, will be incompatible with the economies in public expenditure which are now essential. They consider that even the reduced programme goes beyond the needs of the situation. For the sake of a settlement, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has offered to accept the above programme in its entirety, provided that is initiated, not this year, but in 1926. He contends that this &quot; breathing space &quot; of one year will enable him to finance the Admiralty programmes in their present form, that the effect of a year&apos;s pause by Great Britain will tend to allay rival exertions, and that the national security will be in no way compromised meanwhile. There can certainly be no doubt that the financial relief which would be afforded by postponing the initiation of the new programmes till next year would be substantial. The increase on the Naval Estimates in 1926 would be reduced by nearly  5^ millions, in 1927 by  5, millions and in 1928 by over  2 millions. The trade depression through which we are passing and the increased temporary expenditure upon Unemployment Insurance, as well as the gradual expansion of the Eevenue in future years, are additional factors in the financial argument.5. We had hoped that the Treasury offer would have proved acceptable to.the Admiralty. We regret, however, that the First Lord and the First Sea Lord have not seen their way to agree to it. They affirm that shipbuilding this year will relieve unemployment, that failure to lay down any cruisers this year will discourage the Dominions from building additional vessels, and, generally, that the delay of one year will render the provision of ships inadequate for Naval security.We do not deny the relevance of the first two of these arguments. The bearing of cruiser construction upon the state of unemployment in the steel and shipbuilding industries is obvious, and we can well believe that comment may be made in Australia that having successfully urged that Dominion to build cruisers at once we hesitate ourselves to do likewise until next year. But the Ministry of Labour and the Colonial Office are not represented on this Committee, and on these matters those Departments will no doubt advise the Cabinet. It is only necessary to mention the Treasury arguments in regard to them; as to the first, that money taken from the taxpayer is less fertile for giving employment than if it is left to be expended by him in the ordinary way; as to the second, that the announcement of the extended programmes above set forth will convince the Dominions of our determination to maintain our Naval strength. We have therefore addressed ourselves to the question of whether a delay of one year in the initiation of this very large scheme of Fleet replacement will in fact endanger our Naval position and affect the safety of the Empire.6. We have, of course, in our Enquiry made a detailed examination of the relative cruiser, submarine and destroyer forces of the British and Japanese Fleets. We think it sufficient for the purpose of this Report to deal only with the main item in dispute, i.e., the cruiser construction. No cruisers that we lay down now can affect the Naval situation before the middle of the year 1928. In that year, if no additional cruisers are laid down by us at the present time, we shall possess. 7 British and Dominion 10,000-ton 8-inch gun cruisers of the most modern type. Japan will have 4 smaller 7,000-ton 8-inch gun cruisers of somewhat older design, and 4 10,000-ton 8-inch gun cruisers. The 7 British vessels will displace 70,000 tons and mount 56 guns; the 8 Japanese vessels will displace 68,400 tons and mount 56 8-inch guns. There does not seem to be very much difference in strength between these two squadrons.    But in addition to the 7 new British[19331] i-i 2
cruisers we have also 6 large modern cruisers launched since the war, of the &quot;Emerald&quot; and &quot; Effingham &quot; classes. Four of these mount 7-5-inch guns, and two mount 6-inch guns. A comparison of the remainder of the two cruiser Fleets is set out in Table A appended. From this it will appear that Great Britain will have, in 1928 and 1929, a very large superiority. It was, however, strongly represented to us by the Admiralty that there is no comparison between cruisers carrying an armament of 8-inch guns with the less powerful vessels to which we have referred. Not only, they pointed out, is the 8-inch gun a much more powerful weapon, but it is protected by turrets which are far more effective than the shields provided in the lesser ships. The Admiralty urged upon us that the proportion of cruiser strength between Great Britain and Japan, following the precedent set by the Washington Conference, ought certainly not to be less than 5 to 3, and yet that in 1928 so far as these 8-inch cruisers are concerned we should still be a long way behind that standard. We are inclined to think the Admiralty underrate the value of the less powerful cruisers, but undoubtedly this strong professional opinion cannot be ignored.The Admiralty further point out that the Programme as a whole is destined to produce a minimum number of Cruisers in 1935. A year&apos;s delay will result either in our being short of this minimum of 70 cruisers in 1935, or in an increased programme in the intervening years. They further point out that 6 Cruisers will reach the age-limit in each of the years &apos;36 and &apos;37, and that, under the Provisions of the Washington Agreement, 6 Capital Ships should be laid down between 1931 and 1934. The building of these vessels- Cruisers and Battleships would, they say, so burden the Estimates for the years from 1931 onwards, that it would be difficult to load the programme of construction further at that time. It is, of course, very difficult to foresee the exact naval situation between the years &apos; 31 and &apos;36, nor is it easy to be very precise about the political conditions which would make it dangerous to postpone the completion of the full programme till the year 1936. It may be fair to assume that the financial position of the Country will have so far improved in these later years as to, bear, with greater ease than at present, the burden of new construction.7. We are, moreover, impressed with the marked contraction of Japanese Naval expenditure under financial strain during the last few years, as revealed by the scrutiny of the Japanese Naval Estimates and by the report of the British Naval Attache at Tokyo. The reduction in the extraordinary expenditure in the last five years has been as follows : -	192.-22.	1922-23.	1923-24.	1924-25.	1925-26.Millions of yen ..	357	262	115 -	. 154	105 (estimated)The report of the British Naval Attache has already been circulated to the Cabinet.8. Surveying the position as a whole in the light of all the evidence and arguments submitted to us, we cannot feel that national security will be endangered by the delay of one year in beginning the series of new programmes.Apart from the financial saving, we think there are positive advantages in the publication of an agreed series of programmes which will enable contracts to be made on the best terms, and will avoid the annual conflicts between the Treasury and the Admiralty, with all their resulting uncertainty and friction. We should therefore advise and welcome a settlement between the Departments on the basis that the Admiralty programme is accepted, together with the Treasury proviso of its being begun in 1926 instead of in 1925. On this basis the programmes of new construction and their expense would be as set out in the following table : 
	1925-26.	1926-27.	1927-28.	1928-29.	1929-30.	1930-31.	1931-32.Cruisers 							Glass A.			2&quot;	. i-   -	.. ^.	1	1Class B			&apos;    1 &apos;	2	2	2	COAircraft carriers .					1		Destroyers			9	&quot;d	. :           9	9	9Submarines 							&quot; 0 &quot; type		6 -	6	6	5	6	6Fleet type			-   -&quot; *		1		Gunboats..		4		1	.   .

It would be understood that the Admiralty Estimates in any year would not exceed the total formed by adding the above votes for new construction to the &quot;existing total of the Naval Estimates, excluding the present new construction vote. Under-spending on the new construction programme in any one year would, of course, be carried forward to successive years. The Admiralty would of course be free in the event of serious new facts arising to press for an increase or- acceleration of these programmes, and they would of course be subject to modification as the result of any future international Naval agreement. The ordinary control iof the Treasury over Departmental expenditure would, of course, be maintained, but a wide discretion would as heretofore be enjoyed by the Admiralty as between the various heads of expenditure.:2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, July 13, 1925.
