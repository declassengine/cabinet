JONFIDHNTIAI   LIBRA&apos;&apos;&apos; fThis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)MET.L355(25)CABINET.ARMISTICE DAY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.Before separating for the Recess I would ask my Colleagues to come to a decision as to the general lines on which Armistice Day shall be observed this year.    Last year the arrangements were placed by the Cabinet in the hands of the Home Secretary subject to his obtaining The King&apos;s approval to his proposals.    His Majesty expressed his personal satisfaction with last year&apos;s programme and his hope that it would be reproduced without alteration on the next occasion.    I therefore presume that my Colleagues will wish this year&apos;s celebration to be on similar lines and, for the convenience of all concerned,  it is desirable that some member of the Cabinet should be charged with the duty of taking any preliminary action which may be necessary prior to the departure of the Court from London.W . tJ . H.20th July,   1925.
