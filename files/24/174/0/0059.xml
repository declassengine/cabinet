I accept the figures of expenditure set forth on page 5 of the Committee&apos;s Report, plus the existing maintenance expenditure of the Navy, as the maximum contribution to which the Exchequer can be committed in present circumstances.	1925-26	1926-27	1927-28	1928-29	1929-30Old Programme   ....

This I regard as the utmost limit of finance which we can contain-plate unless - some great adverse change takes place in the work! situation.On Friday, at the desire of the Prime Minister, I proposed to the First Lord that he should begin two cruisers (and the four China gunboats a very small matter) this year and thus spread the programme of four proposed for next year over two years instead of having a blank year, always provided that no increase of expenditure above the Committee&apos;s total was incurred in either year. The increased cost of beginning these two cruisers this year instead of next year (plus China gunboats) would be approximately  600,000 more this year and about  1,200,000 next year. There would be a corresponding relief in later years. The Treasury are of opinion that the  600,000 required for this year could be found without taking anything more than a token Supplementary Vote, The Treasury estimate that in spite of the shadow cut of  2,000,000 it is safe to allow for a further under-spending of at least  300,000. The&apos; present Vote contains  350,000 for marriage allowances which two Cabinet Committees and the Cabinet have rejected. The number of men coming on to charge during the year, namely, 103,025, would offer, the Treasury suggest, a reduction of  50,000 to  75,000 on the original estimate. A very moderate slowing down in the rate of building up the reserve of oil would provide a substantial increased margin. Similar calculations have been made for next year. It is, of course, evident that if the vessels are laid down earlier the money will have to be found from one source or another, and that there can be no question of delaying con-Struction once put in hand.That there is great room for interior economies may be inferred from the following calculation: In 1914, on the eve of the German war, our total estimates were  51^- millions net. These Estimates included  18? millions of new construction, leaving  33 millions for maintenance. Our present Estimates of  62^- millions (including  2 millions &quot; shadow &quot; cut) contain only  71 millions of new construction and provide for costs of maintenance  55 millions. To make an exact comparison between the 1914 figure of  33 millions and the present figure of  55 millions it is necessary first of all to strike out the non-effective votes on both sides. These were in 1914  3 millions and in 1925  8 millions. The increase in cost of the maintenance of the Navy is therefore measured by the difference between  30 millions and  47 millions. On the other hand, the purchasing power of the sovereign has diminished in the proportion of 175 to 100. If the  30 millions of 1914 are increased by 75 per cent, to allow for this we obtain a figure of  52  millions, which compares with  47 millions of to-day; in other words, there has been a reduction of 101 per cent, only upon the maintenance charges of 1914. - But for the equivalent  52J millions of 1914 after all allowances have been made the Admiralty maintained 45 battleships, 7 battle cruisers and 60 cruisers manned with full active reserve ratings, as against only 17 battleships, 3 battle cruisers and
42 cruisers and flotilla leaders in the same state as the present time. It is difficult to compare these Fleets exactly, but it is certainly true that the present Fleet is less than half what was maintained in 1914. In 1914 also 151,000 men were borne on Vote A, as against 100,000 now. It will be seen, after making every allowance for the decline in purchasing power, i.e&apos;., the increase in the cost of everything, the interior economy of Naval administration, judged by results in war power, has deteriorated by some-thing between one-third and one-half. Even a 10 per cent, further economy in maintenance expenditure would save over  5 millions.If the Admiralty were able to effect economies, it would be possible for them, with Cabinet approval, in any year or over a series of years to accelerate new construction. They could do this in two ways: either by laying down their ships at an earlier period in the year than is now allowed for, or, secondly, by constructing their cruisers, as is quite practicable, in thirty months instead of thirty-six. One of the advantages of proceeding on a programme agreed over a series of years is that designs, contracts, and, even within certain limits, the accumulation of materials can be proceeded with in advance. By each of these two methods 6 months at least can be saved, thus together making up the period of 12 months, and fully overtaking, if indeed it be thought necessary, the period of delay of 1 year involved in the Committee&apos;s recommendations. The Cabinet in endorsing the Committee&apos;s report have therefore placed it in the power of the Admiralty to give full and exact expression to the programme of requirements as set out by the First Sea Lord. It is not a question of whether the view of the Board of Admiralty on the scale of new construe-tion and the dates at which it should be completed is to be modified, it is only a question of whether the Admiralty attach sufficient importance to an earlier execution of their own programme to make the moderate sacrifices of reducing some of the excessive costs of their interior administration. It is obvious that they have a great latitude in this sphere.w. s. c.July&apos; 20, 1925.
