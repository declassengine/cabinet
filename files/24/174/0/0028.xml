0 A B I M g T.DI3AHMAMBHT.Note by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lanoaster.When the proposed Treaty of Versailles was submitted to the Germans in Paris, they sent a note in the course of whioh appeared this phrase        &quot;Germany is prepared to agree to the basic idea of the army, navy and airregulations.....provided this is the beginning of a general reduction of armaments&quot;.     To that the reply was        &quot;$he Allied and Associated powers wish to make it clear that their requirements in regard to German armaments were not made solely with the object of rendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression.     They are also ., the first step towards that general reduction and limitation of armaments whioh they seek to bring about as one of the most fruitful prevent&amp;tives of war, and whioh it will be one of the first duties of the league of Nations to promote&quot;.$his assuranoe by the Allied and Associated Powers was further emphasised first by Article 8 of the Treaty whioh direots the Council of the League to &quot;formulate plans&quot; for the reduction of armaments, and next by the preamble to .&apos;.the military clauses of the Treaties of Peace whioh states &quot;in order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation of the armaments of all nations&quot;, the enemy power &quot;undertakes strictly to observe the military, naval and air olauses which follow.?!It seems therefore clear that the Allied and Associated powers undertook not so much eaoh to reduce its- . &quot;jj ]M] j&quot;c.j&apos;li$  ft !&apos;       -&apos; &quot;     --.  i     .... &quot; , ^ &apos;(THIS P0CUM3MT 13 TH3 PROPERTY OP HIS BBITANHIO M J53TYT 3 jjXWZBBMBft ThCOPY HO. 3^
own armaments as to secure a general reduotion of armaments and that this was the basis of Germany&apos;s acceptance of the&apos;limitation of her armaments.     It is not therefore surprising that Dr. Stresemann should have said on May 18th&quot;The one-sided disarmament of Germany is, according to the clear text of the Treaty not the ultimate aim, but merely a preface to general disarmament.     The other Powers will only be entitled to lay claim to the maintenance of the present state of armaments in Germany provided they tackle the problem of general disarmament energetically.     They have practically done nothing so far&quot; ....or that Herr Gessler should be reported in the Times ofMay 29th, 1925, as having said;-&quot;The control visits of the Inter-Allied Commission, a&amp;d with them the prescription of modern armaments in the Heiohswehr could be tolerated only if other countries adopted similar methods of disarmament. But in point of fact over half a million more soldiers than in 1913 stood under arms in spite of the restrictions imposed in Germany, Austria and Bulgaria. The result was that the moral bottom had fallen out of the disarmament clauses when it came to the question of their execution.&quot;   ........With regard to Haval armaments a considerable step *as taken by the Washington Conference to carry out a general reduction and limitation, and doubtless this will be carried further as opportunity serves.Nothing of the same kind has been done with regard to the land or the air, mainly beoause the sense of insecurity in Surope was so great that it was impossible to get the Continental Powers to consider any scheme of reduction or limitation without dealing with the question of security. It was for this reason that the two questions were linked together in the Treaty of Mutual Assistance, and in the Protocol.     The   Cabinet has now deoided to attack the question of security first, but I submit that that in no way frees us from the obliga.ion to deal also with   he question of general disarmament.
It is said that we, having reduced our land armaments below the pre-war level, have done all that can be ashod of ub.      That surely is not true from the point of view of Germany which has never been  seriously apprehensive of an attach: from us *      J:Ior is it true from our own point, of view. It is often alleged that we have reduced our land armaments so lev; that our negotiating power with  foreign states has been seriously weakened, and even if that be not admitted we can, with our present armaments, .scarcely carry out the world duties which our Dmpiro imposes upon us.      If this be true it is obvious that we have nothing to lose from promoting a general scheme of disarmament unless it be  feared that our meagre armieswill be still further cut down by such a scheme      I cannot  vthink that there is the slightest danger of this happening. I have never heard it alleged by foreigners that British land forces are too big0     On the contrary the only complaint I have ever heard is from the French and their friends who would like to see our armies greater.     v/ith- regard to our air force a general agreement would no doubt enable us if not actually &apos;toreduce it,  at any rate to avoid expanding it,  and that is the declared policy of the British Government.Apart then from the general considerations about the desirability of disarmament as a proven tat ive of war with&apos;which the Cabinet is familiar and tho considerable popular demand for such a policy,  I venture to urge that both on the ground of treaty obligation and with tho object of maintaining or even increasing our relative military strength, we should promote to the utmost of our power a scheme for the general reduction and limitation of armaments.      The main question is,  I submit, how can this be accomplished practically?     There are political as well as material difficulties.
1   q I O t)The chief political difficulty is Russia.      As long as the present attitude of the Soviet Government continues and Russia maintains her armies at their present strength it is useless to expect any serious reduction of armaments by her neighbours.      That means to say that Poland, Szecho-Slovakia and Roumania, not to speak of the Baltic States, cannot reduce their (armies unless Russia will also do the same.     And if these countries remain fully armed then their Western neighbours will find it very difficult to cut down their forces.      From this point of view the key of the position is in the po;policy of Russia&apos;.      I am not, however, convinced that even so something might not be done.      In the first place the Soviet Government have mere than once pro-fessed their wish to reduce their armaments if their neigh-bours would make an agreement with them so to do, and the/ even went so far as to hold a Conference on the subject in the Spring of 1922 or 1923.      The Conference was abortive, and there were very considerable doubts as to the sincerity of the Russian move,      But sooner or later it is almost certain that the Russians will desire to reduce their&quot; armaments if for no other reason then on financial grounds, and we should be ready to take advantage of the offer when it occurs.      Secondly,  though it might be impossible to induce the neighbours of Russia to agree to do more than not to increase their armaments unless Russia also did so -that/&apos;LnI itself would be a step and a considerable step in the right direction.      A similar undertaking might be obtained from the Western States,      In any case there is ground for - hoping/
that the French, the main military power in the West, might be induced to accept a considerable reduction as well as a limitation in return for the new Security Pact.      A good deal would be gained too if a general agreement for reduction and limitation could be arrived at even if it were dependent for its execution on securing the assent of Russia.The material difficulties are often said to be even greater than the political.      This question has, hov/ever, never been exhaustively investigated,     No doubt if an expert Committee consisting of representatives of tie fighting services be asked -&quot;What do you think about disarmament?&quot;  they will almost inevitably reply that it is impracticable.      If, however,  it were said to such an expert body &quot;We desire to carry out a policy of disarmament, what would be the best way of doing it?&quot; -I cannot myself believe that no helpful answer would be forth-coming.     After all, we have disarmed the enemy states, and few people doubt that that disarmament has been,  in the main,  success-ful.     Doubtless it would be difficult to carry out  to the full the methods which were employed, in dealing with the enemy states, but short of that if a limitation both of the personnel   -and the expenditure on armaments were agreed to,  that would be, I believe,practically effective,      Theoretically it may.be true that secret armaments cannot be absolutely prevented, but  with the existing highly developed intelligence services of all countries, and the difficulties which democratic and parliamentary government throw in the way of secrecy,  it is very doubtful whether the danger of secret armaments is really as great as is roraetimes th.ou.ght;.      1 fancy that, our  own War Office,  for instance,  would have no difficulty in. Informing the Cabinet with reasonably trustworthy accuracy as to the existing armaments of  any country in Europe, except perhaps Russia.
But I do not dispute that there are very many questions of difficulty about any plan for disarmament, particularly with reference to aerial disarmament;      Indeed,  if I may be permitted a personal recollection,  I spent many months in 1922-.23 in debating and discussing these questions with British and foreign experts, and I hope I am not therefore likely to underrate the difficulty and complexity of the questions involved.      What I suggest at present  is only that a searching international enquiry shall be made into the subject,      It ought to be made by a body which would contain both military and/political experts ,      I believe such a body exists in the recently formed Co-ordination Committee of the League of Nations - but if for any reason that body was not thought sufficiently strong for the purpose it might be strengthened.     My practical suggestion therefore Is that at the forthcoming Assembly the British Delegates should propose that this,  or some other similar body,  should enquire into and report, upon the principles of international disarmament by land and air. It might be necessary to add the sea&apos; also,  though the Washington Conference has really rendered, any enquiry of that kind unnecessary since it has- shown that there are no insuperable difficulties in the way of naval disarmament.      If such a step were taken, it would prevent it being said that we were not trying to carry out  our Treaty obligations,      It would, not bind us to any particular scheme,  or any particular ratio of disarmament, but it would enable us when time and opportunity served to formulate such a  scheme in the future,(Signed)      CECIL..&apos;July Sth,  1925,
