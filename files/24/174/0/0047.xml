CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY^ 355--6&amp;yumex&amp;-&quot;u*-^^ His Br ttannid-jyLa^0 A a I isi I! T, ^.... SHERIFF COURTS -AND LEGAL OFFICERS  (SCOTLAND ) DRAtfT BILL.C.P. 348. (25).Memorandiam by tile Secretary for Sqotland.I desire as a matter of urgency to obtain the authority of the Cabinet for the immediate introduction of the attached Draft Bill, with a view to its passage into law during the present Session.The Draft Bill is an essential preliminary to the reorganization of the Procurator Fiscal and Sheriff Clerk services in Scotland which has been the subject of prolonged discussions and negotiations since 1921.The Royal Commission on the Civil Service made certain recommendations designed to improve the organization of these services and the oonditions of servioe of Procurators Fiscal and their staffs and Sheriff Clerks and their staffs. As these recommendations were of a general character and required examination in detail a Departmental Committee was set up under Lord Blackburn&apos;s chairmanship to go more elosely into the question and to submit detailed proposals.     This Committee reported at the end of 1920, and its Report has been the basis of the subsequent discussions.Hitherto Procurators Fiscal and Sheriff Clerks, though appointed &quot;by the Lord Advocate and the Secretary for Scotland respectively, and remunerated by salary from public funds, have not held office as Civil Servants and have not been subject to Civil Service regulations or eligible for pensions or gratuities under the Superannuation Acts,     The staffs have been appointed by the Procurators Fiscal and Sheriff Clerks respectively and have held their posts at the pleasure of their employers and not as employees of the State,The object aimed at by the Blackburn Committee and by the schemes subsequently framed by the Government of the day was to establish a service in each case of whole-time Civil Servants supplemented by part-time officials in districts where conditions do not justify whole-time appointments.Allowing for differences of circumstance the Government&apos;s proposals were similar to those framed for and accepted by County Court officials which were the basis of the County Courts Act of 1924;I regret that it has not been possible to secure oomplete agreement with the officials affected.   After prolonged negotiations agreement was reached in 1923 with the representatives of Sheriff Clerks and their staffs on all matters except the question of counting service prior to reorganization for pension purposes and the eligibility for pension rights of the older men in the service.   With the Procurators Fiscal and their staffs no agreement has been reached, but it is believed that in this case too agreement might have been reached if the pensions question had been settled to their satisfaction.Like/
Like my predao-esaors I have received repre&amp;errtat-i-ona and deputations on this subject, and have considered it carefully In conjunction with the Lord Advocate and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.     I have come to the conclusion that, howeverr much I may sympathies with the alaims of the officials, it is not possible, having regard to the serious effects whioh a departure from recognised practice would have on other settlements, to meet those claims.   The late Government decided that the utmost concession possible was to put back the effective date for establishment and pension purposes to let October, 1918, and I am satisfied that this is the utmost that can be offered.1 may add that the officials have pressed their claiir in many quarters, and it will probably receive strong support from all sections of Soottish Members of Parliament when legislation is Introduced.Having reached the above eonolusion, I find it of great importance that the necessary legislation should be obtained at the earliest possible date.   Serious discontent will arise if the improvements of salary and conditions of service for which the schemes provide are much longer deferred, and these cannot be brought about unt11 the services have been placed on a new statutory basis.     whatever criticisms may emerge upon the Bill itself or upon the schemes to which it is designed to give effect, they cannot he so serious as the criticisms which would be evoked if no Bill were now introduced.The fees taken In the Sheriff Courts were revised as from 1st April, 1922, and the Increased revenue to Exchequer from this source should be amply sufficient to meet the cost of the Procurator Fiscal and Sheriff Clerk services after reorganization.Opportunity has been taken in the Draft Bill to deal with some missellaneous matters affecting Sheriff Court administration and certain legal offices,   I do not anticipate that these will arouse any serious criticism.   The provision in Clause 14 will bring Scotland into line with England, a similar clause having been incorporated in the County Courts Act, 1924,. The Draft Bill and this Memorandum are approvedoy the Treasury, who agree that every effort ought to be madeto pass the Bill during this Session.IJOKff GILMOtR&apos;.Scottish Office. 15th July, 1925.
