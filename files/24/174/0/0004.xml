oNTIAL LIBRARY?33(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; G GOVERNMENT) .(Memorandum by the Postmaster General).1. The Post Office submitted to the Treasury its Telephone capital programme for 1925at a total of  13,^40,000,  (including  614,000 in respect of unemployment relief works) with an intimation that the probable requirements     would be 13 millions in 1926-37 and. about the same in subsequent years.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer has offered, me a total of 52 millions to cover this and the following 2 years.      1 am prepared to accept a total of 25 millions for 2 years or 36 millions for 3 years, but any smaller sum will mean the starvation of the service and reaocumulation of arrears.It may be mentioned that Telephone Capital expenditure is financed from loans authorised under the Telegraph Money Acts and is not chargeable to the Votes.2. A restriction of capital expenditure such as the Treasury foreshadow would have such disastrous results upon the development and efficiency of the telephone service thfit j think it necessary to obtain a decision from the Cabinet as to the policy to be pursued.3. During the Y/e,r telephone construction works, other than those required for national purposes, were necessarily suspended., while the small margin of spare plant available was steadily absorbed.      The-inevitable consequence was that in the years succeeding the War the plant was wholly inadequate .to the demands ma.de upon it, with the result that the service relapsed into a condition of inefficiency and became the subject ofC A B I NE T.C R E T.TELEPHONE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE504/25.oublie
public contempt?   -the local service -waa slow and unreliable, now! subscribers could, not be connected without indefinite delay, and -the trunk lines were congested with traffic which they could not handle.     In the lest four years considerable progress has    V been made in overtaking.arrears as well as providing for currentiexpansion.      Eut even now there are certain areas where new subscribers cannot be accepted, and in many of the important towns the margin of spare plant is perilously smallj    the capacity of a large number of exchanges is on the point of exhaustion and many of the trunk routes are fully loaded.      In:;   kt &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; . pMay 19^4,  1^5 of the larger exchange areas in the country were closed to canvassing, either in whole or in part;    in the ensuing ^ months,   41 were opened but 87 others had to &quot;be closed owing to the spare plant being absorbed.      This is due to a steady increase in the public demand for and use of the telephone service.     The now orders received in January numbered 81,000, the highest monthly figure yet realised.     The recent growth of the service is illustrated by the following statistics t-DateNumber of StationsIncrease over previous yearNumber 47,946 100,054.115,3.09Percentageiffembsr 31st, 1922 &quot; 1923 &quot;        19241,028,258 1,128,312 1,84-3,^215.1 9.7 10 . 3Year endinc;;Number of I runk Calls.Increase over previous year Numb e r . j       P e rc entage&apos;fflber 3.ist, 1928 &quot; 1923 &quot;        19245^,757,747 701/78 76,^5Q,S70a too r-;Ro 9,943,931 9,958,1928.317.5 14.9

But in spite of this expansion telephone development in Great Britain remains deplorably baclcwerd compared with many foreign countries of far less industrial importance,  as the following figures indicate;-Tele phones of the W0 rld^ 1923.

It is especially significant that Germany, notwithstanding her political, economical and. financial difficulties,  should have added 158,000 stations in 1921-2 and 168,000 in 1922-3, while the expansion in Great Britain is represented, by only 120,000 stations per annum at the present time.5,    There are, however, a number of indications which point to the present rate of expansion not only being maintained but accelerated, and I look forward in the next two or three years to having to provide for a nett annual growth of some 150,000 stations instead of 120,000 as at present,  with a corresponding expansion in tho trunk service. For this purpose it is essential that the construction of plant? both new exchanges and lines, should keep pace with, and indeed anticipate, tho demand.     The long period required for completing the more important works,  such as exchanges and trunk cables, makes it necessary to place new works in hand some three or four years before they will actually be required *      The programme for noxt year is closely confined to works which will be needed as soon as and in some oases considerably before the estimated date of completion.      If arrears are once allowed to accumulate, the service immediately begins to deterioratej    the number of areas in which new subscribers have to be refused quickly increases, obsoleto plant has to bo maintained in use with a decreasing efficiency, and all the trunk lines will revert to the congestior from which they suffered four years ago, and with which some aro still seriously afflicted.6.    The capital expenditure of the telephone service in tho last four years has been as followsj-1921-22 7,446,0001922-23 6,780,0001928-24 7,578,0001.924-25 9,500,000The
The corresponding expenditure, on the Bell telephonesystem in theUnited States has been:Dollars..192118&quot;0&quot; miTTion1Q2218511.192525011192420811The significance of these figures is increased by the fact that at the beginning of the period the American development was so advanced as to suggest that the point of saturation might almost have been reached;    and they indicate the enormous field for development in Great Britain which has not yet been touched.7.    The special provision for unemployment schemes ( 614,000) which is Included in the 1925-6 programme and the extension from 1-J- to 2 miles of the-radius from the Exchange, within which service is provided, at the ord.ina.ry tariff rate, were designed also to stimulate the telephone development in rural areas and. to give evidence of the Government&apos;s desire to assist the agriculturalist wherever possible.      From the point of view of the telephone service they are less urgent and if the Government feel that they cannot afford to make such a contribution towards. Unemployment Relief and such a gesture towards Agriculture, I must acquiesce in their being deferred.      But the remaining is million represents works which are required to meet current demands and which cannot be postponed without the service suffering.80    I infer that the Treasury are disturbed at the capital demands of the telephone service, not merely because they have to be met from funds raised directly by the Government, but because they are competing with the requirements of other industrial undertakings for the capital avaijLffibla for investment,  and may the-tT^fcsre tend to raise
the price of money and make conversion operations more expensive.     On the other hand,  it should be noted that the Government are themselves encouraging the expenditure of capital through the Trade Facilities Act and have in fact accorded Government guarantees to the extent of over 53 million, some of which is applied to the provision of plant for foreign undertakings0      It seems anomalous that the Government should be compelled to starve a national service for which they are themselves responsible while they are at the same time giving a State guarantee for the provision of plant for other undertakings, both here and in foreign countries.      If the telephone service was conducted by private enterprise,  it would have no difficulty in obtaining the funds required;    and indeed,  if any difficulty existed it would probably be regarded as a suitable object for a. Government guarantee under the Trade Facilities Act.9.    Since the revision of the telephone tariff in 1921-2,the service has not only paid, its way but, in addition to large&apos;- reductions in charges, has returned handsome surpluses  -to the Exchequer, after providing for interest on capital,depreciation and pension charges.Year.

I ask therefore that capital expenditure for this year and next may be authorised to the extent of 12 million,and
and 13 million.&apos; respectively .      As to the Unemployment programme. I am In the judgment of the Cabinet,11..   If the Cabinet are unable to accept  these proposals, the existing policy of developing the service must at once be reversed and efforts ma.de,  as fe.r as possible,  to choke off rather than to encourage new subscribers.      It might even become matter for further consideration whether the rates should be increased as a deliberately restrictive policy.    But such a, policy must provoke vigorous and continued criticism in Parliament and in the Country.      It will be forcibly argued that, as the Government have made the telephone service a Government monopoly&apos;,  it is their duty to provide the funds necessary to maintain and develop it efficiently, more especially as the service itself can carry the necessary interest, amortisation and depreciation charges, and that if they are unable or unwilling to do so they had better retransfer it to a private company which would have no difficulty in finding the money required with - or indeed without - the assistance . of the Trade Facilities Act.W.
