&amp; zSIR ADAIvI NliiMO said that the situation was, he thought, even rather worse than it was when the Council met a month ago.     The figures which were before the Council ( and are shown in the statistical table at the end of these notes), indicated a considerable falling off as compared with the corresponding week a month earlier, and a serious decrease as compared with the 1913 average for June.      They seemed to indicate a reduction as compared with the 1913 average at the rate of 56,000,000 tons of coal per annum, which was a very grave reduction in the output of the country.     The financial results of the industry showed that the industry had moved into a very serious and grave situation.      It was quite impossible, on such results, for the collieries to be carried on.     The point was being reached when it was going to be better from a financial standpoint to stop collieries on a large scale, unless they could bring about quickly a re-adjustment of the working con-ditions.     As was generally known, the coalowners, having regard to the financial necessities of their case,, had given notice to terminate the Sages Agreement at the end of July.He did not look upon coal as a problem that had to be taken by itself, and if the Government, as might be found to be necessary, should intervene in the situation he hoped they would be influenced by the view that in handling the coal crisis at the present time they had to consider that that problem is bound up with a very much broader economic problem, namely, the future of the other four leading industries of the country.      The coalowners were very anxious at the present time that an endeavour should be made to find a true economic settlement.     He believed that if the situation was looked at in its broadest aspect, and a settlement could be arrived at in the light of those considerations, it would be one of the best pieces of work for the country that had ever been done.But the situation in the industry was so grave and the re-adjustments that would have to be made to meet the economic facts were so great, that we could hardly expect the Miners&apos; Federation to accept the situation readily. Speaking rather from a personal point of view, Sir Adam thought that probably the Government, at such a stage as they might consider opportune, might desire to review the whole of the facts surrounding the industry.     He believed that, as    far as the coalowners were concerned, they would be quite glad if such an enquiry took place, because there had been no industry which had been so closely investigated as the coal industry, at the joint meetings of owners and men;    and therefore if there was a desire that these facts should receive either a closer investigation or more publicity, he thought that the coal-owners would welcome that being done.Sir   Adam itfimmo said he was satisfied that the future of Iron and Steel and Shipbuilding and Engineering in this country was bound up with the problem of Ccjial, and if anything artificial was done in connection with this settlement, or anything of a purely arbitrary character,
6 6 confidential. COAL (Oontd.).it would,  in the long run, be to the prejudice of the country and would hold up for an indefinite period the other big industries upon which the coal industry depended-. It would be unfortunate if we came to the end of July and the coalowners were invited to suspend notices,  or any-thing of that sort, in order to permit of a Government Inquiry taking place then.    If the Government wished to Inquire, he thought they should inquire as soon as possible. They might decide that the mind of the Miners&apos; Federation had not at the moment been sufficiently clearly spoken to lead the Government to act within the next day or two, but there was little doubt that an indication would be given very quickly of the outlook and policy of the miners Federation,  and he submitted that as soon as. that is dis-closed the Government should consider whether the appropriate hour had not arrived for reviewing the whole of the facts connected with the coal industry.Mr. GALLACHER said that just now things in Scotland were very difficult because of the threat of a coal strike. He happened to live in the Lanarkshire Coalfield and he knew the attitude of the miner.    The miner said that such a basic industry as mining, so dangerous and arduous, ought to afford the people who work there a fair living wage, and that was an argument very difficult to answer.   They also asserted that while miners&apos; wages at the moment stood at about 40 per cent, over pre-war, the price of stores, iron, timber, steel cables, and that kind of thing was at least 200 per cent, above pre-war point.   They took up the position that wages ought not to be the first thing to be reduced.Speaking from the consumer&apos;s point of view, he thought it deplorable that the mining industry should be moving, as it seemed inevitably to be, to a stoppage.    The miners and mine-owners were two highly organised bodies; when once they had embarked on a course, neither would readily draw back, and he thought that, unless the Government took some action we should be face to face with a stoppage somewhere about August.    He hoped better counsels would prevail, but once the idea of a strike gets under weigh, he knew the diffi-culty cf stopping the momentum of such a movement.IRON AND STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that he had to report that the Sheffield Steel and Tool Trade had fallen away steadily since the Council&apos;s last meeting.    In some directions it had practically disappeared.    The Japanese market was in a hopeless condition.    There was also the fact that of the alloys used in steel, practically none had been sold in the last three weeks; firms were working off their stocks and seemed to have no occasion to buy further, which was a serious indication of the lack of orders.   They were also feeling now a great deal of  competition in these special steels from Czecho-Slovakla and Austria, those two being the lowest in the prices quoted.     Sweden was another competitor.   Again, in Australia a certain amount of steel used to go from this country, but it was now being made there, and it was the same in Japan.    The French competition was very heavy in Belgium, and also in South America particularly in finished tools, but also in steel.

He continued, as follows :-INDIAN IRON.   2,000 tons of Indian iron have arrived in &quot;the Clyde recently at prices which can meet all competition.&quot;TINPLATE TRADE.

c% 9 p L L QSIR GLYNN&apos; WEST said that he had nothing cheerful to report as regards Engineering and Shipbuilding and the Steel Industry. These trades &quot;vere very much in the same state as they had been of late,    rather worse than better, except that in the heavy steel industry the costs had improved somewhat because of the present very low price of coke.   Another factor was that stocks were being sold, and there was some very cheap scrap steel on the market at the present time.   Neither of these conditions could last very long.Unemployment would be greater if firms were not taking orders at below cost price.    They were beginning to wonder, however, whether they could go on employing   labour at a loss, and the banks, too,  sere beginning to want them to stop doing soThere was no doubt that the high wages paid in sheltered industries had a great deal to do with the trouble in the other industries.    There were many other things to which that trouble is also due, but these high wages were a big factor. Skilled engineers,  and in fact all the employees, were dis-disturbed owing to the high wages that the sheltered industries pay to corresponding types of labour in those industries. Sir Glynn v&apos;/est had taken a group of works employing the same number of people on the same sort of employment in the engineering trade this year as before the war in 1913 .   He did not take their basic wages, but their receipts, what they took home at the end of the week.    It was a good oompF^ron.. because in that particular group they were working full time in both cases, in 1913 and in 1925.    The result of that, taking Into account the increased cost of&quot; living, was that the engineers were found to be receiving l/- a week more now than they were before the war.   So if it were not for the sheltered trades receiving these high wages, it did not seem that there would be very much difficulty in industry finding some means of reducing costs Personally, he did not believe that a reduction in wages was the best method of reducing costs; what they really wanted was longer hours and more production from capital.   We had heard of increased production resulting from working shorter hours, because it was said to be a physical impossibility for people to work equally hard during a somewhat longer day.    He did not think that had been proved.   A suggestion had been made in the en engineering industry that the working week should be increased to 50 hours from 48.    It was put forward as some-thing tentative,  to discuss, but was not accepted.   Sir Glynn 7?as convinced that, especially in. the North, a proposal for longer hours would have been received more favourably,  if they had said &quot;ftill you go back to ordinary hours, starting at 6 in the morning, with a break for breakfast&quot;?   Working 50 hours a week meant that the men started off after a very early breakfast, too early to get a breakfast that would last till lunch time.    If they accepted  any increase in hours, he thought they would prefer to go back to the full increase and start at 6 o&apos;clock In the&apos; morning.The continental position was worse than ever.   Be had just had a letter to say that rods, which were a good indication, could be purchased on the Continent at  5.15.0 and nails at 8 guineas, which were ridiculous figures.
Gj, Q. ry As hi iENGINEERING AND SHIPBUILDING-  (Contd.) .In shipbuilding, most of the orders that -were being obtained were very much below real cost.   Firms were refraining from putting on overhead charges as they ought to be put...........-......on, and that was a thing which they could not go on doing for very long.SIR JAMES LITHGOW wrote:-&quot;Shipbuilding can only be described as in a state of chronic paralysis. &apos;&quot;To my mind the only ray of hope lies in the fact that Coal Mining itself is now suffering the inevitable conse-quences of restricted output imposed upon it by the Sankey Commission and subsequent peace-preserving agreements which for some years now have been imposing a crushing burden on the   coal consuming Industries.   Self preservation may do what protests from injured consumers have failed to dp.   I also hope that the present crisis may be a useful warning to Shipping, Transport and other industries, which have adjusted the level of their costs on a sentimental basis, leaving out of account the wishes and needs of their customers, and may bring home to them that in the long run uneconomic arrange-ments must recoil upon their promoters.&quot;ELECTRICAL TRADES.Sir HUGO HIRST said that as regards the electrical industrial he found himself In a minority of one    in being still able to report a happy state of things.   Reckoning six months of this year compared with last,  they wore distinctly ahead In output. They had,  last month, felt for the first time, so far as orders were concerned, a little holding back, but he was of opinion that was largely psychological.   Nothing tangible appeared to have happened last month which would make the demand worse than it was the preceding month., but the fact that these crises were thought to be approaching - the railway crisis, and the coal crisis, - had had an effect on the country at large, and for the moment created a depression which was more than the state of the country, in his opinion, justified.The export business  was much the same as he had reported at the last meeting.   Argentina had considerably improved. The Malay States had come on  as a very satisfactory purchaser of British electrical goods,   China, of course,  was still bad, and the anti-British feeling had shown itself in that Germans were getting orders, - and whatever might be the state of^the finances of Germany, the electrical firms were strong and were giving extended credit to China.   Australia was still very good; South Africa was a little better; India v/as not good, but was also getting better.
9 9 QC 0 N FIDSNTIA L. TEXTILES : COTTON.COL. SEDDON BROWN said that the whole trade was certainly depressed.     In the American section the Federation of Master Spinners had decided to run only 39t hours per week;    as a result of a ha Hot, 85 per cent of the trade were in favour of that, and that would he carried out.The unfortunate part of the trade a&apos;s present was the Egyptian section, which had formerly been quite good in some directions. It was now estimated that 18 per cent, of the spindles in the fine trade were stopped entirely, and a large majority of those that were running were only doing so for 30 hours a week.     That was almost entirely due to the shortage axad high price of Sakel cottop,. Great ingenuity had been displayed in finding substitutes -especially Empire grown cotton, - for Sakel, but there were certain yarns and cloth that must be made from Sakel.He had spent two or three weeks in Germany and Austria. Germany was one of our big markets in the cotton trade.   Business there was fairly good;   but, trade being so bad at home, every-body was catering for the German trade, and Germans were obtaining longer1 and longer credits, and people were doing business with Germany on very much less secure t-erms than they had done previously.     The Germans were grumbling to some extent that their great stocking and glove industry was being hit by imports into Great Britain of American stockings and gloves made entirely in America, and they could not understand why they should not have  -some advantage in the import of German stockings into this country, seeing that they are made entirely of English yarn.The retail trade here in cotton was certainly better, but that was only 20 per cent, of our manufacture.     It was stated on all hands, from large and small concerns, that this wonderful spell of weather had created a great trade over the counter for cotton goods.     Colonel Seddon Brown knew of instances where a shop had sold as much cotton goods in one week during June as it did in the whole of the year 1924.SIR WILLIAM CLARE LEES said that in&quot;the Manchester trades the order books were again lighter than they were a month ago. Production had continued at much the same level, but a wide examination of the order book position would, he thought, lead one to realise that existing orders were due to run out to a considerable extent during August next.     Replacement, however, was not going on, and unless there was a considerable replacement of orders between now and the end of August, the order books in the Autumn would be much lighter even than at present. The serious factor which had emerged since the council met last was the intensification of the trouble in China.     That had led to a definite suspension of business in some of the types of trade, particularly the auction trade that was done from Manchester.     The indent trade to China was, however, to a large extent going on.He was told from many&apos;4quarters that in the home trade the present fine weather was causing a clearing out of stocks: retail shopkeepers were selling stocks they had had for a long cime, and the distributors to shopkeepers were clearing their racks.     Nevertheless the weather could not result in the giving nov 0f nQW ord?rs ^is year and increasing manufacturing business
? 2 $w w uTEXTILES:  COTTON (oontd.).As to the world position, Sir William Clare Lees thought there was unwillingness to purchase rather than lack of purchasing power, because they were meeting with a total cessation of buying for the time being, which he did not think was very unnatural.   They were facing a transition into another crop.   The acreage was very large.    The crop was entirely dependent on tho destruction of insect pests.    If these destroyed a large amount, the industry would have a small crop, if they did not, we should have a large crop.    All the world knew that, and he thought that, quite wisely, they were just marking time.   British exports of cotton piecegoods had been on a large scale for some months; the world was not badly supplied, nor were there large accumulations of stocks.    The hesitancy in buying did not appear to be due to absence of buying power;  it was unwillingness to buy rather than lack of economic power to do so.TEXTILES: WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY said that in the Wool Textile trade,  the situation was, briefly, much as it was a month ago.    He did not think there was any difference in employment, which was   very bad, probably as bad as it had ever been for many years, with the exception of a short period in 1920.    Employment would be maintained for two or three months longer on present orders, but virtually no fresh business was coming in at all.    This applied equally to thebome and overseas business.    Exports, as would be seen from the official returns, had fallen markedly in the last two months; and Imports of Wool Textiles, though relatively small, were greater in the first five months of 1925 than in the first five months of 1924.    On the question whether losses were being cut, and to what extent the decline in values had been faced, there was a ready disposition on the part of the Trade as a whole to sell practically at any price they could get, but really there was no market.    This was due largely to an absence of world demand rather than to exceptional competition.MR.ANDREWS WROTE:-&quot;Since the last meeting I regret to say there has been no improvement whatever in the position of the Wool Textile Industry of the West Riding of Yorkshire.&quot;The position here is still extremely bad - the unemploy-ment register remains the same.    Very considerable sums of money are being lost especially at the raw material end of the trade, but there are a little better signs in respect to the stabilisation of values.
CONFIDENTIAL. TEXTILES: WOOL (CONTD).&quot;The wool sales in Australia were suspended over May and June on account of the slump In values.    The^ are to be resumed on the 13th July and the probabilities are that the suspension of the offerings will have had the effect of stabilising values to some extent.&quot;The London sales will be resumed on the 7th July and the whole trade Is looking forward to these sales indicating the present value of raw material.    One of the greatest difficulties we have to face at the present time is that the amount of business being done in Tops, Yarns and Piece goods is so small that it is very difficult to ascertain the actual value of any of these commodities. Sofavas we oan see, so long as the present state of the heavy trades are in their present deplorable condition no reasonable hope can be entertained of any serious improvement in the Wool Textile Trade.&quot;TEXTILES: WORSTEDS.MR. 3UTCLIPFE SMITH said the situation was very much as it was last month.   There was a slight improvement in total unemployment in the last few weeks.    The number of spindles in operation was 66 per cent, of the total number, the number of looms running full time 43 per cent,  and 40 per cent, were standing Idle.    On the whole spinning was better than weaving.    All manufacturers found It most difficult to maintain business:    they were taking a few orders at cost or even less than cost to keep the looms together and keep the operatives going.The PRESIDENT said it was important to ascertain what the productive capacity was to-day, as compared with pre-war capacity.MR. SUTCLIPFE SMITH promised to get the - information. He added that there would be a little hope of Improvement in the trade if after the next sales people could feel that there was more stability in wool prices.    Then, orders that were now being held up would come along.As regards exports,  South America was a fairly satisfactory market at the moment.    Australia was keeping up a fairly good demand.    Our trade had been heavily hit by the Chinese troubles, and the organised boycott of British goods was  a serious matter.
6 3 confidential. CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY said that the Chemical industry was showing very serious signs of depression.     In heavy chemicals there had been a noticeable decrease in demand, not only in the export trade, but also in the home trade, and the same remark applied to practically every other section of the chemical industry,   Germany had almost entirely sup-planted this country in the supply of dyes to India,     The present state of affairs in the colliery and iron and steel trades had reacted very seriously upon the coke oven undertakings in this country.     Coke had become practically unsaleable and a large number of these important under-takings had had to cease operations altogether.     That had a serious effect on the sulphuric acid trade, because the coke ovens were very large consumers of acid.     This state of affairs was further complicated because in the new spelter industry which we had established, acid is necessarily produced so that the position In the sulphuric acid Industry had become most difficult.     A few months ago he had informed the Council that about 65 per cent, of the sulphuric acid plant in the country was in operation.     To-day he   -estimated that only 45 per cent, of that plant was working.There had been a very serious fall in the consumption of residual products arising from the manufacture of gas, and, following on that fall in consumption,  a serious set back in the price of those residual products had occurred, with the result that the price of gas itself had to be advanced in many parts of the country.The Importation of continental fertiliser, continued to a large extent, and our home producers of super-phosphate were quite unable to compete without loss.Mr. Perry saw very little hope of improvement in the chemical industry till our home coal production could be put on an economic basis.     It might, however, have been noticed that the successful establishment in this country of the atmospheric nitrogen process had resulted in an enormous quantity of sulphate of ammonia being produced,  the whole of which was exported.POTTERY,MR. ROLLINS referred to the figures received from the Employment Exchange,  which indicated that, out of 9,000 unem-ployed, 60 to 65 per cent, were short-time workers.    The sltua-tion generally in the Pottery industry was much-the same as it was last month, and the future did not appear to be hopeful. As far as the home trade was concerned,  one could not say much except that it was affected by the general depression in the basic Industries of the country.   The operatives indeed took the view that, Oven if there was an improvement in trade, there would be a higher percentage of unemployment normally than before ;the war, because there had been a change In the methods of production which enabled more female employees to be brought in and less skilled labour to be used, and on the whole secured a greater output.-
RUBBER.MR BIRLEY   said that the Rubber trade generally, with the exception of the Waterproof trade, was fairly well employed,  though prices were leaving a good deal to be desired.     The -aterproof trade -was affected by the weather;    nobody wanted to buy with weather such as the present.     The competition from France In the rubber toy trade was very severe, prices being such that manufacturers here could not approach them within fully 25 per cent.,    but fortunately the French manufacturers could not deliver very large quantities.     This  toy trade employed mostly female labour in this country, but there was a fair amount of it.     Competition in solid tyres was considerable from Italy, and had been increasing lately, and has also been increasing from France.      The competition in that and in other things from Germany had very largely disappeared.      Competition from the United States was not as great as it had been.The chief anxiety of the trade was as   to its raw material.      It appeared to have been decided that nothing could be done to  alter the Stevenson scheme.      It seemed a pity that, with stocks at such a dangerously low figure, (5,000 tons as compared with 50,000 tons this time last year), releases must remain at an increase of only 10 per cent, for each three months.     That meant that plantations could not get up to 100 per cent till some time next year.     He felt that if greater releases could be made at times of great stringency it could not do harm to the planter, and certainly would relieve the present position when spot rubber is about 3s.3d.,  and rubber for next year is 2s.2d., a difference of Is. a lb.      That difference simply meant that the speculator would get hold of it.      This point of view, he believed, had been put by the manufacturing industry very strongly.BANKING AND FINANCE.MR BRAND   said that in the sphere of international finance the principal change had been the further depreciation In the currencies of France,  Italy and Belgium.      Mr.  Pease might be able to speak about the Italian depreciation. The French and Belgian were much more obvioiis .    The general opinion which Mr. Brand had heard expressed in France was favourable to  the Caillaux scheme, and it was hoped that if there was sufficient political stability, he would get the breathing space required in order to put the necessary drastic measure into force.SIR ARTHUR MALEOUR noticed that in the figures in the statistical data  (given at the end of  these notes) as to the Clearing House Re turns,1 there seemed to be a big 1&apos;lse) and this appeared hardly to be the result of trade.^MR, PEASE   said that last&apos;month,  June being the end of the half-year, was attended as usualoya certain tightness in Money Markets, and rates had been firm in spite of a certain amount of Continental buying of gold in this Market.    The Market
1 9, O d ejs tjCONFIDENTIAL. BANKING AND FINANCE (Contd.)had had to go to the Bank of England to the extent of 2 0 million pounds at 5-g- per cent.   The tightness during the last week had been perhaps specially pronounced.   The Stock Exchange had been rather depressed in consequence, and further contibutory causes were to be found in the industrial difficult ties at-home, the troubles in China, the condition of the French finances and the comparative apathy with which apparently they are regarded in France, and the fact that Underwriters of recent issues here had been left with a large proportion of the amounts they had underwritten.Mr. Pease observed that he had been asked whether he could throw any light on the increased bank clearing returns; which seemed anomalous when we know the depressed state of trade. The explanation of the increased turnover at the Clearing House appeared to be due to Stock Exchange and. new issues.    There were other anomalies.   Bank overdrafts had shown over the last six or eight months a steady rise, and that was generally supposed to be an indication of improving trade.    He could not quite explain the position now in regard to increased overdrafts. At the end of last year it was, he thought, a fact that it did indicate great activity of trade.   But the increase had still continued.    That might have been due to a certain extent to seasonal causes, such as the collection of the Income tax.    But if it still continued further it would be difficult to explain, because he did not think a large proportion of the increased advances had gone to bolster up firms which were suffering especially just now owing to the bad state of trade.    If an analysis could be taken   and he was trying to get one out --of the increase in Bank advances it might show that a very large proportion of it was due to activity in some of the smaller-trades.In reply to Mr. Samuel, Mr. Pease agreed that no doubt the luxury trades were prospering, the motor and cinema industries, and the big retail stores .MR. TENNANT said that, as regards trade, the only bright spots appeared to be Coventry, with the motor trade, which seemed to be very prosperous, and v. .-: Macclesfield with the artificial silk trade.   With those exceptions he could see nothing very encouraging in his Bank Reports.   As to finance, he thoughtthat probably the amount owing by the market to the Bank of England was more like 3 0 millions than 2 0 millions, with regard to the.Stock Exchange, there were seme interesting figures In &quot;The Bankers&apos; Magazine   for July; it appeared that the depreciation in gilt-edged stocks since 31st December was about 16 0 millions.SHIPPING.SIR ALAN ANDERSON&quot; regretted, that he had not anything new or cheerful to report, but one would not expect it because shipping figures simply reflected the world trade.   The index number of freights for May was the lowest in the last 5g years and was only about 4 per  cent, above 1915 when expenses were very much less .   Seeing that the Board of Trade index number of wholesale prices was 159, it would be realised what extreme difficulties the tramp shipowner was in.       Sir Arthur Balfour had said that
CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPPING. (Contd).he was having to give some of his products away, without making profit, or covering establishment charges. That was the position the shipowners had been in for several years,.    Sir Alan confirmed Sir Adam Nimmo&apos; s view that any artificial attempt at restoration, or anything except facing the facts, would do harm rather than good. He thought the only cheerful aspect of the position was that everyone is beginning to see the facts more clearly.    We have,  as Sir Arthur Half our said, to come down from champagne to beer.Sir Alan Anderson was in Brussels last week at the International Chamber of Commerce Conference. The Italian shipowners present said they were still trying to get their Government not to go in for Flag Discrimination, that they realised It was a bad thing: and they said it  as though they meant it. The American shipowners at the Conference, however, were all coasting shipowners, and they had clearly been out of touch with the movements among   other ship owners- and commercial people of the world.   They were wanting to pick a quarrel with our Mercantile Marine,  in particular in the matter of flag discrimination. They agreed in general that flag discrimination would do much more harm than good, but it was their own Coasting Trade that they &quot;were anxious to protect from British participation, and Sir Alan had told them that we were not proposing a policy of trying to break into it.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB said that the aggregate traffic receipts for the first 25 weeks of the year, showed, for the four amalgamated Railways,  approximately a decrease of 1 per cent.    Passenger receipts were up by 1 per cent: merchandise receipts were down by 3 per cent.    As regards, tonnage,  the figures for April (which are the latest available) showed that general merchandise carried was 200,000 tons less than April last year: coal, coke and patent fuel over 2,000,000 tons less: and other minerals about 400,000 tons less.   As regards individual traffics, the tendency remained about the same: there were big decreases in the raw materials in the Iron and Steel Trades, and increases in building items, such as bricks, cement and sanitary tubes.    In April this year and last the number of working days was the same.
Ct g t: &amp; it *)CONFIDENTIAL. GENERAL    TRADE.MR STANLEY MA CHIN said that, like the other speakers, he had no comforting news to give.      The reports he had received throughout the country all tended to show that things were worse rather than better since the Council last met.0   He had not quite followed Mr, Gallacher in connection with the latter&apos;s remark about miners&apos; wages, because he did not think employers had any desire to cut wages if it could be avoided.     what they wanted was output.     He could give an example now in the Food industry,     His firm had been com-pelled to establish works on the Continent, in France and Belgium especially, in consequence of two things, their high tariffs and their cheaper output.     It was not that there was no demand for British goods,     They were now being called upon for bigger supplies of goods manufactured by British firms under foreign conditions than ever before. It was a question of price, and price was materially governed by output.     Dealing with France, his firm^s labour, bill was 10 per cent, less than it was in this country. In Belgium similar results were obtained.The Country could not possibly go on unless they were prepared to produce their goods so as to be able to com-pete in the world markets.      In Steel particularly, and, in other trades of lesser importance, there were an immense number of undertakings in this country being carried on at an absolute loss.     In connection with the export trade, speaking for the Food branch, which he represented, he had no hesitation in saying the returns now ware very much less than they were before the war.     Although they were just holding their own at home, they found it exceedingly diffi-cult to maintain their position in the export trade.COLONEL ftlLLSY said, in the situation generally, as it was seen by the   Federation of British Industries, he could not discern any more promising prospect than at last month&apos;s meeting.      The situation was generally discouraging.It would appear, he thought, that the situation roughly is that, in view of the impossibility of investing more money abroad, our export trade in all branches was shrinking..     High taxation and the .disparity in prices in sheltered and unsheltered trades which tended to stimulate home consumption as against export trade are the points which seemed to govern our whole position.     If the insufficiency of foreign investments was the reason for our decline in exports, It emphasised the view that had been put forward that in many countries where there was a potential buying power there was at present an inability to pay;    and where crops in those countries promised well, and there was a demand for our manufactures, he would suggest that an assessment might be made, in anticipation, as to the results from those crops, and corresponding credit facilities given by our Government.
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTINUED ).SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that one of the facts we had to face was that we were trying to live a champagne existence on a beer income.     We could not do it, and until we could begin to meet the prices of some of our foreign competitors we should not do any good.     In the steel industries, he would instance the Czecho-Slovakian and Austrian competition in our Dominions, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.     It was not a question of our cutting,prices by 5 or 10 per cent, we should have to cut them by 35 per cent.     It was an Impossibility in present circurastances.     He himself in severa1 markets to-day was giving goods away at cost price in order to try and retain his goodwill;   he could not go on doing that.SIR JAMES LITHGOW wir-ote: -&quot;I hope that the Government will cease to feast its eyes on the idle extravagance of London, and cast a glance to the industrial districts, not merely with the idea of drawing solace from some passing spasm of energy, but with a real desire to grasp the true sombre facts.     If they would only do this, it seems to me they could scarcely fail to realise that it Is the duty of the statesmen of a country which depends on International trade for its very existence, to boldly tell our people that &quot;standards of life&quot; cannot be built up on Acts of Parliament, and Social and Philanthropic schemes, or even on Industrial harmony, but only on the aggregate of the effective effort of the individual, and again that the effectiveness of that effort cannot be judged by a hypothetical standard set up by our doctrinaires, but only by the hard cash value put upon it in the world&apos;s markets.&quot;Shaping our policy on these lines will of course be a relatively unpopular process, but when we face it we may hope to get at least our proper share of what trade is available, and thus obtain increased employment.     Until we get that share we have no right to build our industrial hopes upon the possible effect of more settled conditions and a greater volume of trade generally.     This will come in due course when we cease to trouble about the theories of isentimentalists and political agitators, and preach hard work as the essential basis for social legislation of any sort or description&quot;.SOOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES,MR GALLACHER   said that since the last meeting things had gone on much as before, in a-vvery quiet way. For the first 25 weeks of this year the Scottish Wholesale Society showed a very slight increase in trade, about 2 per cent.Wool prices had fallen, but not sufficiently, and everybody was waiting for lower prices before they bought. With regard to clothing,  they found that there was a big demand for cheaper material.     That was probably due to the prevailing unemployment, because in Glasgow there must be 70,000 workpeople unemployed, perhaps more;    in Scotland, possibly 120,000 to 150,000.      It also reacted on people who are still employed, because If they were afraid of unemployment they naturally would not spend so largely as during better times.
c 9 r&quot;SCOTTISH CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES.    (Contd.) Indeed there was, Mr, Gallacher thought, a complete want of confidence in the future, and that was very bad for business. Everybody was buying short.     He confirmed what had been said by Sir William Glare Lees,  that this was a time when people were clearing out stocks, and he believed It was because of w ant of confidence as to what the future might hold for Industry,     They found that the larger retail Co-operative Societies were sending customers to the Wholesale Society, because they would not themselves hold their usual extensive stocksj   and so this retail trade, which was not a- profitable trade to the Wholesale Society, and was a sort of accomodation trade for the benefit of the smaller retail Societies who could not in any case hold varied stocks, was almost overwhelming them at this particular time.    it was&apos; increasing the indebtedness of his Society, hut not very much, for the Indebtedness of its members to the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society was only about five days&apos; sales.   That, he thought, was a satisfactory feature.     Most of the indebtedness was secured by share capital and loan capital on which they had a lien in the event of the Society being unable to pay.He had been asked whether he could say that the consumers were living at the same comparatively high level as during the war or whether there is any decided retrogression towards the standard of living prior to 1914.     He intended to go into that, and hoped at the next meeting to supply all the information possible.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR, SANDERSON said that since the last meeting of the Council a definite Scheme had been put forward for the control of wool prices, but the present indications were that there would toe a good deal of opposition to any such scheme if it involved a system of export licences, and there was some difficulty in raising the capital required for financing the scheme.     The opening of the London Wool Sales was being awaited with more than usual interest,  and no doubt the state of the market here would govern,  to some extent,  the action of the Australian seller in marketing the balance in the Commonwealth.   At the same time one had to remember that a large amount of the clip had already been sold, and the sums, which had been received by Australia on that account and also on account of wheat and flour,  were considerably in excess of any in previous years.In answer to Mr. Pease, Mr. Sanderson said that the majority of the smaller growers would very likely favour some scheme of control,  especially of those classes of wool that are not of finer quality,  but the larger growers and the other v-ool interests there,  he thought,  would,  generally speaking, be opposed to the Scheme,   He thought there would not be any likelihood of the Commonwealth Government supporting a scheme that was not supported by the large majority of growers.The financial position had been affected to some extent by the coming conversion of. the War Loan in December.     There had recently been an Important meeting of the Loan Council to
9 Q Q &amp; (D 0CONFIDENTIAL. AUSTRALIAN TRADE  (Contd.).deal with the various State and Municipal Loans.   At present It seemed probable, with the money already in Australia, that the matter would be dealt with satisfactorily.MR. SUTGLIPPE SMITH saia he heard that Australian wool textile manufacturers were agitating for an increased duty on British wool goods; and any such increase would be very serious.    He also raised the question how far the Australian Tariff Board was independent of the Government,MR. SANDERSON, in reply to the President, said that the Tariff Board had power only to make a report, and if a duty was in fact varied,  it had to be done by Parliament.   At present there was a recommendation from the Tariff Board before Parliament, but particulars were- not yet available.INDIAN TRADE,MR. LINDSAY said that with regard to the crop position In India there was very little change since last month, and India&apos;s purchasing power depended very largely on their crop position.   With reference to what Sir William Clare Lees had said as to there being at the present time general unwillingness, rather than inability, to buy cotton goods, it should be remembered that Indian cultivators were getting only about 40 per cent. more than in 1913 for their rice and wheat in India, and were having to pay between 160 and 170 per cent, more for their cotton textiles.   Of course that was the price of the goods landed in India.The industrial position in India was distinctly unsatisfactory.    The Indian cotton industry during the past few months had been working against great odds, and it had piled up stocks of ,200,000 bales in Bombay, with a value of about 5 million pounds sterling.    The explanation of that was to be found partly in competition from Japan, with its result that Japan and   Bombay between them had pushed up the price of Indian cotton to a height very little short of American parity.   Formerly the price used to be 5d or 6d below Middling American; now the margin is lfd., with the result that the Indian cultivator was now refusing to buy.even  \ Indian mill-made goods.    Bombay and Lancashire were now standing on about the same footing in the price for cotton.. Japan had taken 2,000,000 bales out of the Indian crop of 6,000,-000 bales, and it was this competition which had pushed up the price so high. - -As to Iron aid Steel, the Tata Steel Works had pulled round owing to a protective tariff backed by a subsidy. The pig iron position In India, which was an important factor, was suffering very much from depre-&apos;sion.   The maximum capacity of the various Indian Companies was 450,000 tons, and the Indian market could only absorb 50,000 tons. They were looking abroad for markets to sell their sj rplus, but were receiving great discouragement in the Japanese and American markets.
CONFIDENTIAL. INDIAN TRADE (pontd.).Further, the Cement industry was in difficulties, the capacity being greater than India can absorb, and the Coal industry was also in a serious position in India.    All this affected the general industrial situation, which was a distinct question from India&apos;s purchasing   power, the latter was very largely a matter of crops, and, as to the prospects of these, we muut wait for the conclusion of the monsoon.CHINESE TRADE.MR. LANDALE said that business in China had been in a great measure brought to a standstill by the recent political disturbances, and althoughthe banks and shops in Shanghai had reopened, the strikes in the mills and on the wharves and steamers still continued.    These strikes were entirely political as, when they took place, no alterations in the &quot;existing terms of employment were under discussion between employers and workmen.    The present conditions In China were, in a large measure,due to the disturbed state the country had been allowed to drift into, owing to the absence of a Central Government with any real power in the country.   Any steps the British Government could take to assist in the establishment of a Central Government in China would also assist the restoration of British trade.    The Chinese had no difficulty in maintaining order among themselves if they wished to do so, as had been clearly proved at Tientsin and Hankow during the recent troubles.The earnings of the Peking-Mukden Railway showed a great improvement during June and repayment of their temporary loans had been resumed.    The Tientsin-Pukow Railway was still interfered with by military occupation.    The Shanghai-Nanking and Shanghai-Ningpo Railways were free of troops, but their earnings had been interfered with by the Shanghai disturbances. The European Staff on the Cavlton-Kowloon Railway had been withdrawn to Hongkong, but trains were still running.The strike in Hongkong, organised by political agitators in Canton, still continued, and very little business could be transacted.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE .MR. HOSE said that, in connection with South American banking, he was afraid there was not much to say that had close relation to the export trade of this country.    The exchanges in all South American countries, except the Argentine, had so depreciated that their purchasing power was very limited and would take some little time to improve.   Mr. Perry had referred to the question of synthetio nitrate and sulphate of ammonia.    This was an interesting subject for Chile.    He through that there was no great likelihood of synthetic superseding natural nitrate.      It was true-that synthetic
CONFIDBNTIAL. SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE (Contd,)was increasing in quantity year by year and was at prices which are much lower than natural nitrate, but natural nitrate was superior to synthetic.    Further, the demand for nitrates was increasing, particularly in the United States. The relation of this to British trade arose particularly from the fact that the purchasing power of South America, particularly Chile, was bound up very much with the success of their nitrate industry.As to Brazil there was nothing very much to be said. The exchange remained more or less where it was,   and so that country&apos;s power of purchase was still very limited. Their position had improved slightly, and. there was a small surplus on the Budget.In Chile one met with a good deal of trouble in the matter of legislation. They were passing a variety of laws whereby the employed wer3 to gain a larger hold and control of the work that is done, but, as is usual in those countries, they were going further than was usual in other parts of the world,  and were imposing conditions which were so burdensome as to be almost impossible.    Therein lay the probability that these projects would not continue.A commission of American financiers recently visited Chile,-to report as to the course they thought should be adopted in connection with a variety of financial questions: indeed to advise the country as to how to promote economies. Mr. Hose was doubtful whether any advice given would in fact be adopted. But he did not like to see an American Commission invited to a country like Chile, because if they, rather man this country, gave them financial advice and financial  assistance,  the result might be an increase in trade with the United States instead of with ourselves. We were, however, fairly secure at present   as regards American competition in exports to South America, for the South American had regarded British goods as being likely to be equal to sample.There was no great change in the Argentine. They were keeping back their crops very much, because of low prices: but they had enormous crops to sell, and would undoubtedly meet the market in due time.UNEMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS said that on the 22nd June the figure of the unemployed register was 113,500 higher than on the 25th May.    Nearly the whole of this  increase took place at the beginning of jane, at Whitsuntide and immediately after.Taking this increase geographically: - in the South of England, including London, there was a net decrease of 17,000 in the month: in the rest of England there was a net increase of 103,000,* and in Scotland and 4ales net increases of 13,000 and 14,000 respectively.    We had not yet any industrial details with regard to these increases, but it seemed probable from their geographical distribution that they had occurred very largely in the coal industry.
CONFIDENTIAL . UNEMPLOYMENT (Contd.)As compared with a year ago, the figure at the end of June this year was 286,000 higher than at the end of June last year. There was, of course, some 70,000 or so to be deducted from that to niake the figures comparable. We had an industrial analysis of the numbers of insured workers unemployed at the end of May last as compared with a year ago, and that showed that there was a net increase of 161,700 in all trades taken together, and that the increase in coal mining by Itself was almost of the same amount - just over 161,000.&apos; Other large increases were in Iron and Steel (14,000),, Tinplate (6,000) Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (95,000), Wool (33,500) and Dock Labour (14,500).   On the other hand there were substan-tial reductions In general engineering (21,500) and Cotton (47,500 hRATIO OF HOME TO FOREIGN TRADE.THE PRESIDENT said that an estimate had been made of the ratio of home trade to export trade at the present time.   Until the results of the present Census of Production were available he did not think that any exact estimate of that could be arrived at, but if the members of the Council could give some indication as to whether they thought the relative proportions of business they were doing at home and overseas was about the same as before the war, or had changed, he would be glad to have the information. As far as coal was concerned, the position was apparent upon published figures.MR. PERRY remarked that the  advent of new products in the chemical industry rather complicated the question, and he would probably have to take a definite set of commodities and compare that with the same set at an earlier date, he could not, however, give any figures off-hand.ANGLO-GERM AN COMMERCIAL TREATY.THE PRESIDENT said that the Government had been very much exercised as to what the German import prohibitions would be under the Treaty, and had deferred the progress of the Bill which was to enable us to put the Treaty into execution,  and of the ratification of the Treaty itself, until we had the list from the Germans.    It had now been received and was a very small list.    Textiles did not figure in it at all, nor did Iron and Steel.   Coal was in the list,   as we understood it would be, but this was subject to the under-taking given in a letter handed in by the German Ambassador before signature, to the effect that British exporters should be given licences in the same w jy as before. The Government had also, taken up specifically, pending ratification of the Treaty, the question of export licences.
CONDITIONS IN GERMANY.MR. BRAND said he had recently spent a fortnight in Germany, and there he saw many hankers and manufacturers. The steel makers all said they could not compete at the moment with France and Belgium in certain lines, and they put it down to the French and Belgian manufacturers doing exactly what they themselves did during depreciation, selling their goods at prices which they thought were very profitable to them;   and it was only when depreciation ended that they discovered that they had been selling at a loss.     The steel makers in Germany also said that the only chance they saw for the steel industry anywhere, certainly in Europe, was combina-tion, some agreement between the different countries-    that they were, as far as exports were concerned, selling without any profit at all.      Their home trade was fairly good, but in general Mr. Brand did not think the companies were pay-ing dividends,     They had great difficulty as regards capital, but that would not lead to less competition from Germany. The worse their position got the worse their competition would be,    so far as he could see.     The general impression that was made upon him was that the depression is an absol-ute world depression at the moment, and there seemed to be plenty of causes for it In the fact that the world had not adjusted itself in various ways since the war.     One had great destruction of capital in Russia and China and East-ern Europe;    one had a number of countries with increasing tariffs, and new industries growing up;    and in particular there were these fearful shocks, first of German inflation, then of deflation, and now the French inflation and the Italian inflation.     And whatever we did in this country, we could not expect the world depression to disappear rapidly. It was also true that we had not adjusted ourselves more than anybody else, - in particular in the matter of the sheltered trades.     It was possible we were suffering to some extent through not having adjusted ourselves to the gold standard.     In 3-ermany wages seemed to be much lower than here, though they said the wages are   considerably higher than they were.     They were working much harder.     They were supposed to be working an eight hour day, but in many cases they did not restrict themselves to it.     There was, further, an extraordinary shortage of capital which seemed to be going to last for some time, because Great Britain and America had lent all the short credits they are likely to lend. It was certainly impossible for this country to lend long capital to Germany, and it was very doubtful how much America would lend.     The Germans had the Reparation payments to make. They had a considerable fall of securities on the Stock Exchange and while many Germans thought it a good time to buy shares, -Mr, Brand did not personally think there was any hurry about it, because apparently for a long time the financial position in Germany would be a difficult one, and when they could get 10 or 12 per cent, on first class mortgage for a long period of years, there was no reason for them to buy shares.     Dr. Schultz had said that&apos;  they had 350,000 unem-Ployed now, but possibly the figure was really somewhat higher.In general the Germans were not as badly off as we were, because although they were suffering from world depression
(* Ljt aCO NFIDEETIA L. CONDITIONS IN GERMANY.  (Contd. )like&apos; ourselves, they had come down more to &quot;bed rock economic facia. 1* WQn.ld be unwise to count on a rise in wages in Germany leading to less difficulty here.     No doubt there was a much lower standard of living there and much harder work, than here.     That accounted for their better position compared with us.     But the net result of Reparations was to force down the German standard of living in order that they might be able to pay, and then you made their competition much more severe.     Mr. Brand held the view that our troubles would only be made worse by Reparation payments.As regards the credits given by German banks, the President mentioned that we knew of a case of a large long credit being given by German banks to Brazil in connection with the shipment of coal,     Mr. Brand thought that that would not be done to any great extent.     He was told they had in the Coal trade in Germany somewhere about 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 tons, actually won, which they could not dispose of.SIR HUGO HIRST said he would like to refer to the question of wages going up in Germany.     One of his colleagues had just been over there and made a very careful examination;   and it was quite clear that the Germans to-day worked 55 hours on the average, without overtime payment, and overtime payment started after 55 hours, and was only 10 per cent, over ordinary rates.     The official hours were 48;    then the employers had a right to claim two hours for the Fatherland, or Reparation work;    then the employer had a right, if he so desired, to one hour extra per day. That brought it up to 55, and the workmen worked cheerfully. They were satisfied with their 35s, because it was gold.    They compared it with the depreciated exchanges in Belgium, France and Italy, and they felt happy about it.Sir H. Hirst promised to send in a carefully compiled list of different industries in different districts where the actual hours of working were stated.COLONEL SEDDON BROIvN observed that he had found that in the German Textile industry too, whenever they got work, the limit of 4-8 hours was never observed;   they always worked longer.CONDITIONS IN ITALY.MR. PEASE remarked that Mr. Brand had asked him (see page 11, ) to say something in connection with the Italian exchange, which had   depreciated very largely during the last month.     The position of the Italian exchange seemed rather anomalous.     Employment was very full in Italy:    the Budget was balanced:   their financial position generally showed very considerable improvement:    there had been a large incursion of Pilgrims into Italy.     All these features would have been expected to tend to the improvement of the Italian exchange.     Various explanations of the anomaly were put forward.     The adverse trade balance was a natural one;   then they had had, to buy considerably more wheat than usual;    the remittances from abroad to Italy (which was a very large invisible export) had fallen off slightly; and it was understood that the great incursion of pilgrims was not very productive in the way of money spending In Italy;    one American would spend in a week in Paris as much as twenty pilgrims would spend in a month in Rome.     The resurrection of the question or the repayment of Inter-Allied Debts had also had a bad effect
CONFIDENTIAL. CONDITIONS IN ITALY.    (Contd).on exchange, and people in Italy were a little frightened as to what    that   might mean to Italy, which had no surplus in its balance of trade.      There had also been a certain amount of anxiety owing to the recent Government restriction of Stock Exchange operations, which had frightened&quot; people, and those who had large commitments in other countries had hurried to close those commitments and buy sterling or dollars.     It was rumoured at one time      but there did not appear to be any real foundation for it       that to some extent the depreciation was artificial, that professional speculators on the Stock Exchange welcomed the idea of depreciated lire which naturally would be accompanied by a rise in the price of securities on the Stock Exchange.     As a matter of fact, whether there were any artificial operations of that kind or not, the result had not been what they would have liked,     Securities had     not shown a comparative appreciation as the lire had depreciated.
