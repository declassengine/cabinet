417 Y. Pi-ench Embassy, London.- , July 22nd, 192?.My dear Chancellor,(You will allow me to address you thus for the sake of simplicity.)I received a letter from Paris this morning confirming the news which you had yourself received and about.which you spoke to me yesterday evening.      I am told that M, Caillaux, and possibly M. Briand, will very shortly come here to discuss the Debt question with you. The date of their arrival is not settled and it would be preferable not to publish their decision, in order to avoid comments in the Press.      M. Caillaux would be preceded by three persons in his confidence who would arrive here at the beginning of next week. .   These, will be the Sous Director de la Direction du Movement des Ponds&quot;*, M. Horeau-lu&amp;et, M. Thion de ia Chaume, one of my friends, whose daughter is golf champion, and M.. Barnaud, who came here last April.     Thion de la Cilauiae , who was at one time in collaboration with M. Caillaux, subsequently entered the Bank of Indo-China, and was the Prench delegate on the Commission de Ravitaillement during the war.     These gentlemen may arrive a little later than I have said, but I think that your conference with M.Caillaux Can take place at the beginning of August if that suits you.Yours sincerely,(Signed)   A. de Pleuriau.x   Corresponds roughly to Deputy-Controller of Finance in the Treasury,
