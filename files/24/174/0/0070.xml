IS .1IB PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .C R E T.---------- C A B I N E T.p   371(25)r-------SECOND COMMITTEE ON MARRIAGE ALLOWANCES for naval OFFICERS., AND RATES&apos; OF PAY OF,, NEW ENTRANTS IN THE FIGHTING SERVICES.VESTED RIGHTS. REPORT.We have made our- recommendations as to the rates of pay for new entrants both for officers and other ranks.     There remains the question whether these rates should apply to new entrants properly, so-called alone., or to those who extend and -re-engage;    and the further question as to whether they should apply on promotion.     We wish to express our opinion very clearly that His Majesty&apos;s Government has a perfect right to alter the rates of pay of any of the three Services at any time as may seem best to them.     No officer or man has any legal claim for any particular rate of pay and we think it very desirable that this fact should be thoroughly understood by all those serving His Majesty.     At the same time it Is clear that some-thing in the nature of a moral obligation may have been.created as to rates of pa;/, if statements have been made or action taken which afford reasonable ground for the expectation that no such change will be made.      It is on this basis that It has been urged up4n us that no change on the present occasion should be made except in the case of new entrants.VESTED RIGHTS OF MEN ON RE-ENGAGEMENT AND EXTENSION. 2.     We accept the view of the Departments that while a man is on his current engagement he should not be brought on to new scales of pay on promotion.     The question is a different one then he enters into a fresh contract by extending or re-engaging. There is no question but that the Government/:YY. i        t V ^      &apos;     i : &apos;   : : l    &apos;M8 DOCUMENT-
has a perfect- right to introduce new conditions when a man voluntarily enters into a new contract.     Unfortunately the whole position has been prejudiced by a reply in the House of Commons given on March 18th, 1924.      The question was mixed up with the reduction of officer rs pay on July 1st, 1924,  in connection with the cost of living;    but we think the impression which would be derived from it was that men serving, in-the Navy when^reduetions of pay are made will not be affected by them for the rest of their service.MR.  AM3RY ......  &quot;ILere are one or two other points in connection with the Estimates to which I hoped the hon. Member would make some reference.    In the First Lord!s statement it was mentioned that the&apos; pay of officers &quot;will,  in accordance with, the recommendations of the Jerram Committee,  be subject to a certain r eduction on 1st July next.      I wish he had also been able to tell us v/hether the Admiralty now feel themselves in a position to inform the House whether, in connection with any modification of the pay of officers that may then take pnace,  they will be able to find room for the demand, so often repeated in this House and so essentially justified,  for some form of marriage or, as I would prefer to put it, some form of family allowance for officers.      I also hopec&quot; that in connection with the same question of pay, when dealing with the other ranks and ratings in the Service, he would give us some general assurance with\respect to the reductions in the pay of other ratings which may conceivably accompany any reduction in the pay of officers.      I would make a very earnest appeal that those reductions should be of the most limited character,  and that nothing should be done  to interfere with the splendid type of highly-skilled men and admirably-disciplined men whom we are&apos;;&apos;bring-ing into the Service to-day.      I did hope that- the ton. Member would be able to say whether any reductions are in contemplation or not;    I hope they may not be.      In any case,  I hope that nothing will be done that will affect the pay or prospects of any mon now serving who entered the Navy under what they clearly understood tc be definite undertakings.&quot;MR. AMMON:    &quot;As far as the officers are concerned, the reduction will amount to  % per cent, and no more.,      As far as the ratings are concerned those who  rare in  the Navy now will &quot;not be affected,MR. AMSRY:    &quot;The hon. Member said that with regard to  the ratings,  those who are now in the Navy will not be affected.      I am very glad to hear that decision.&quot;
3.      It is evident that an Important factor must be the amount of money involved.     V/e were informed by the Admiralty witness that if the new r^tes were applied to men who extend or re-engage there would b3 a saving of  18,000 in the first year,  58,000 in the second, and  99,200 in the third year.     In the case of the Army the saving would be  110,000,  220,000 and  320,000 respectively In the first three years, assuming the scheme came into fores on October 1st,  1925,      Of the amount in the case of the Air Force we were not informed, but It may be taken to be of a much less important character,4,      It is no-doubt true that the amounts would continue to increase until the peak is reached, but we do not think It necessary to consider what -would happen after three years, because if the position of public finance then still urgently requires economy, this and other matters will certainly have to be reconsidered.5.      It has been suggested to us that a distinction might be made in this respect between Army and Navy,      It is said that men entering the Navy do so with the intention and expectation of remaining there 22 years - whereas no such intention and expectation exist in the case of recruits for the Army.     This view received some support from the Treasury witness and indeed it is not without considerable foundation in fact.      But the Army witness, while saying that the Army Council would be willing to apply the new rates to re-engaged men if applied in the case of the Navy, also insisted that they would - regard with profound misgiving any attempt to differentiate between-the Army and the Navy in this respect.     This view/appears to us to be sound and we
cannot recommend a differentiation between the two Forces.In view therefore of the Reply given in the House of Commons as recently as March of last year and the serious discontent that, we are informed by the Admiralty witness, would be caused in the Navy by a decision depriving the men in that Service of what they have always looked upon as their just expectations, we have come to the conclusion that all men serving on the date of the introduction of the new scales of pay should continue to receive the present scales notwithstanding that they may extend or re-engage. A man who leaves the Service and afterwards re-enlists would of coarse have no such privilege.OFFICERS.6. It was contended that the report of the FisherCommittee of 1919 implied, if it did not state explicitly, that no change would be made in the rates of pay for officers, beyond the 20$ which was stated to be varied according to the cost of living.      The paragraph relied upon Is as follows,T....in fixing the new rates of pay, etc.  for Naval Officers, it has been decided that BO per cent of the new rates of pay and retired pay shall be considered as due to the present high cost of living and shall be subject, after five years, to change either upwards or downwards, according as the cost of living rises or falls;    the revision thereafter to take place every three years, up or down, on the basis of the Board of Trade food prices ind.es number71-      (Parliamentary White Paper 270 of 2919).We were not able to agree that that was the meaning of the paragraph in its nadrural sense.    It seems to uS-not to go further than to say that 20$ of the pay shall bt-
alterable, and  not that the bOfi should remain unchanged. But we -vere informed by the Admiralty witness that it was understood in the Navy to have the other significance and we were a good deal struck by the fact that Sir G-ecrge Barstow, the Treasury witness, assured us in his view that.1that AiasJthe intention of tho Cabinet when they arrived at that decision.    In these circumstances it would be difficult to contend that reasonable expectation had not been raised that no change beyond the 20)i would&apos; be made. We think it very important that whatever decision the Cabinet may arrive at on this particular question,  it should be clearly - sta ted for the future that no obligation, rests on the Government not to make ohanges in the pay beyond the 20^c.    Still as the expectation does exist and as the Treasury regard it apparently as not unreasonable, we do not think that a change beyond the 20$ should new be made fsr officers already serving unless very strong reasons existed.7.     We hold that it would be difficult to maintain that a Mi i ihipman has a vested right that the rate of pay for anAdmiral    at the date of his entering the Service should never be changed;    and the same applies in the case of a Seoond-Lieutenant and a General.   But there is no proposal to change the rates of pay of officers except very junior,officers --that is to say ranks up to and including a Lieutenant in the Navy, and a Junior Captain in the Army.    It was agreed by both the naval and military witnesses that cadets certainly had no legal right to the maintenance&apos; of the pay of officers - but the flavy very strongly urged that if a man became a commissioned officer It would be very unfair to change the rates of pay of the ranks just above his appointment.6,      The Treasury witness suggested that the course which
had previously been -followed in similar oases in the Civil Service was to change the rate of pay after one promotion.     That is to say that a Second-lieutenant 6n promotion would be entitled to the present rate of pay of a Lieutenant - but not to the present Captain&apos;s rate when he becomes one.      If it were proposed to make changes right through the whole ranks of officers a compromise on these lines might be worth considering - but si ace It is enly pro-posed to change the rates of pay of the junior officers it would seem scaroely worth while to say that though a Second-Lieutenant had a right to the old rate of Lieutenant&quot;s pay he would have to take the nev. rate when he became a Captain. On the whole therefore we do not recommend tho enforcement of the new rates of pay on promotion.9.       In arriving at these conclusions we have had in mind the fact that we felt bound to report against the officers of the Navy in the nat-ter of marriage allowances, a decision which&apos;has been accepted by the Cabinet, and which will undouotedly produce a certain amount of discontent.     It would be a pxty to add to this dfsoontent in view of the relatively moderate amount of saving involved.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.(1)    All men serving on the data of the introduction of new scales of pay should continue to reoeive the present scales notwithstanding that they m^y extend or re-engage.(2)    All officers now serving should receive the existing rates of pay on promotion.Stgmd on behalf of the Committee.
